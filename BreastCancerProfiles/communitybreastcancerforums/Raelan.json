After surgery, chemo, and radiation I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years, then switched to an AI after it was confirmed I was fully menopausal. I've just completed 5 years of hormonals, and switched back to Tamoxifen for another 5 due to some problematic side effects from AI's. Tamoxifen has been very easy for me and I'm glad it is an option for both my sister and I. Hope to be able to go a full 10 years.",

This decision has by far been much more difficult than the one to have a BMX.  My BS told me there's a 22% chance there's any further lymph node involvement, and after my case was run by the tumor board last Friday the majority felt I should go with the radiation option.  So, that's what I think I'm going to do. This of course impacts my reconstruction, but I'll deal with that later. bdavis - I notice in your signature you went to Nola for a DIEP.  I've been researching NOLA and now am much more interested in the type of reconstruction work they do since it appears I would need a flap procedure with RADS.  I've already consulted with a PS and been told that I don't have enough abdomen fat for a DIEP on both sides, but may be able to do their new \"FIT\" procedure.  What can you tell me about NOLA?  How did you even get started with them?  I'm more than willing to travel for my procedure, and now time is on my side since I won't be getting reconstruction until all my treatment is complete.  I had skin-sparring surgery, but do not have TE's in.  Any advice you can give regarding NOLA would be great.    ",

I get my port out tomorrow.....yeah.  I'm looking forward to not having it as a constant reminder of my chemo days....and it's just flat out annoying.   I'm using this 4 week break to squeeze in some much needed vacation time with my family.  We rented a cabin for 4 days on a private lake. There are only 2 other cabins on this lake and we'll have our own private dock and a few row boats for fishing....I can't wait!  I have 10 year old twins (boy/girl) and I know they're going to have a blast.  After everything we've been through as a family the last 4 months it will be a really nice break for all of us. We're going next week, which puts me into 3 weeks PFC so I should be feeling pretty good by then.   I've also lost about 12 pounds since I was diagnosed, but some of that was due to my c-diff infection during my first infusion.  I'm actually hoping to lose a little bit more once all the steriods get out of my system.   ",

I am sooooo looking forward to completed this last round of treatment.  It's been quite a ride over the past 5 months. Then, I plan to take a break for a couple of months before starting reconstruction.  Still investigating my options, however, I'm strongly considering a new procedure that utilizes 3 sessions of fat grafting to help restore your radiated tissue, followed by expanders and implants.  There are some women on this forum who seem to be having good success with this approach.  ",

So now I'm faced with two options:  1)  Go in for a second surgery for a full ALND and increase my lifetime risk of lymphedema, 2)  Forgo surgery, but add 6 weeks of radiation to my already scheduled 6X T/C chemo regimen.   Like wildruma, I went with a BMX in order to avoid radition and to be able to do reconstruction with implants.  Now I'm in a situation where radiation is back on the table.  I'm told the benefits between surgery without radiation, or radiation without surgery are the same.   I'm most interested in hearing from those of you who have had full ALND treatment what impacts you've had from that.  I have a real fear of lymphedema because I know it can be pretty debilitating if you get it.  However, I'm relatively young (49), and in good shape so I believe my risk level is a bit lower. Just really struggling with this decision.  Needs to be finalized in the next two weeks as I have a \"save the date\" set aside for surgery on 4/27.      ",

Not looking forward to some of the rad SE's, but I agree it should certainly be easier than chemo.  Then, once all this chemo/rad therapy is behind me I get to start on my recon.  I feel like I have such a long road ahead of me, but then again, I am getting some of the worst over with. I remember reading about the ginseng study on the BC.org research tab.  Apparently it helps with fatigue.  Might have to ask my MO about it.  This is probably the one SE I'm dreading the most since I have two kids at home (age 10) and I work full-time.  I don't have too much more wiggle room as far as my energy level is concerned.",
