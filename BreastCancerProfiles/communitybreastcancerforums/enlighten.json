Tomorrow I find out what my treatment plan has in store for me next. I have been taking a hormones regimen for the last 2 weeks. I am experiencing two different doctors not on the same page with my treatment plan. So I'm looking for answers tomorrow. Still hard to believe sometimes how life just changed over night. But I'm up for the fight.",
