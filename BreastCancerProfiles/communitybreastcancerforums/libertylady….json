Two days ago, a CT scan showed a small spot on her liver. Her tumor markers are elevated and her onc thinks the cancer has metastasized. Like you, Bestbird, she's ER and Pr + and HER2-. It is such a comfort to hear that, even if this is the cancer coming back, liver mets doesn't mean her life is over. Keep writing, and God bless you al",

She only has one met to her liver, which is not affecting liver function at this point, although it is a pretty large one. Her onc is starting her on Femara and Ibrance next week hoping it will shrink or get rid of the met. Does anyone know whether a lower number of mets affects prognosis? She hasn't had her biopsy yet; has anyone gotten this far and then found out that it wasn't cancer after all? I'm trying really hard to stay positive, and could really use some encouragement.",

I know that Stage IV does not mean an immediate death sentence, and that many women with this diagnosis can, as you say, have good quality and length of life with this disease. My mom is blessed with a great onc who has encouraged her that no one can put an expiration date on her life and that there are many treatment options available. Speaking of treatment, does anyone have any experience with Femara and Ibrance together? I understand that preliminary findings are quite promising, but haven't seen much from patients about their own experience. I would like to have an idea of what my mom might expect with this treatment.",
