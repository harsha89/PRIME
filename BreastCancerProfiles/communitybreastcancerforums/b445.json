I did 22 weekly CMF treatments and rads. a little over 6 motnhs later I had mets to the liver. But please know that there was now knowing if that would happen or not if I had done a different treatment. Unfortunately this is a guessign game. the Dr.s try there best to give us advise based on previous history from others but no one can tell you for sure that doing one treatment over another will keep the beast away. wishing the best in what ever decision you make",

I had my first port taken out in Dec. A year after my first round of treatment. In May this year I had a new port put in. It never healed and they wound up taking it out and putting a new port on ther other side. They new port is healing well but the old site is again not healing and they are holding treatment to see if it will heal. So far it doesn't look good. Bonnie What thinners are you on? I take coumadin except before a surgery then I have to stop it and start Lovenox shots until the day before a surgery. Then surgery night start back up on the coumadin and keep taking the shots until the comadin levels are back up to par. Pain in the stomach! I did the shots for 6 months but told them when I got more clots and they told me I had to stay on thinners I wouldn't do the shots unless I had to So glad many of you are done or almost done with chemo. Mine will go on for some time to come. Rads are quick and easy they main thing is to keep the area moisterized and clean. They last couple weeks may get hard but it's doable and your strength will return. I've seen some of you wonder over to the Wagon Circle in Moving beyond. It's a great place for anyone that is dealing with the beast weather you are just begining treatment in the middle or continueing. I hope to see more of you there too! Hugs & Prayers",

I found life always changing the kids growing up and moving out, Job changes, Life cycle changes. MIL developing Dementia, BC. Menopause. Life is always changing around us. There are new challanges all the time. It's what you do with the changes that make life normal for you. I think that's one way the Wagon Circle has helped me with the new Normal. It's part of why I menttion it all the time. The gals there try to be supportive and yes occasional have a minor spat. That's life that's Normal! Normal is my checking up on you ladies and glad to see that a bond has developed. Normal is when the chemo is done and the rads are done you feel a little lost. (That's because we've had so much attention during active treatment) Normal is learning to Move Beyond and still maintain the friendships developed along the way. Some folks will say \"Why do you obsess with that site?\" It'sd not an obession it's a way to deal with the new Normal. How do I know? Well you see my journery, and that's what this is started 2 years ago. I went through 22 weeks of chemo. I went through 36 days of Rads. I went through the I'm done I'm Free, now what do I do? I went to the Moving Beyond: Time To Circle The Wagons thread and I found many that had gone through what I did. I found some that had the dreaded Beast return or spread, or a new Beast appear. I met gals that were just trying to cope with the daily life we all faced but were'nt ready to give up the community that gave so much Hope and Love when they needed someone to \"Get It\" like no one else other than a survivor can. All I can say is I'm glad I have them to be there as I go through this again. They get it and I'm really grateful to have them to call friends. Try it out! Don't lose the friendships that have developed. Feed them and be a support for each other. Rads are really pretty easy. They mark up all over like a roap map them take xrays and simulate how the rads bean will go. once all this mapping is done you go in lay on the table with your arms above your had they set the machine up they leave the room the machine comes one they may move they machine for another angle then it zaps, (you don't feel it) you again and your done for the day. They may take xrays once or twice a week and you see the rad onc once a week. Pretty simple you in and out in no time. the biggest hassel is it's 5 days a week for about 6 weeks. Be sure to use aloe of something like it to keep the skin moisturized as you go through treatment. Most get through without any problems some burn a little. like a mild sunburn. I'm so happy to hear most everyone is done with their chemo and will get to move on to the next steps. Well I've really just gone on rambling tonight, must be the pain meds. Hugs and Prayers",

There are at least two large spots and a lot of small spots on the newsts MRI that were not seen on the one in May. The spots are cellls that got into the brain and have swelled putting pressure. It is not brain tisse that has gone bad. Because of the number of spots it may not be best to go the Gamma Knife route but rather to go the whole brain radation route and if need to done the road go gamma knife. They did another MRI today with a finer look to see if they can tell what the smaller spots are. At any rate I have a very hard and long road to recovery in front of me. Most likey I will have to quit working as some fuctions may be limited. it can be a few months to a year before we will know all of the affects. My goal right now is to maintain as much of a normal life as I can and spend time with family. I fell there is still a lot left for me to do and my time is not yet here. I ask that you keep my family in your prayers as this will be as hard on them as it will be on me. In some ways harder I think for them. Financially this id going to be very difficult but I trust the good Lord will see us through. I will know more in the days to come as to how we will proceed with treatment. Right now I'm going to concentrate on cleaning out my house and making things as simple as possible. I've got a lot of stuff to get rid of  and make room for family to be here if they want to be. well that's all I know for now Love Cy",

It is prefferd to go that woute first and if need be in a month of so go the whole brain rads. So if you dont mind I will ask that your prayers be directed at the insurance company allowing the first option to be paid for. What ever we do we are trying to get it all done before the year is out so that most of it will be covered by the insurance company before we have to start all over with deductibles and copays. Thank you all for your support and continued prayers. Shrink so gald you are at home I know the drains are a pain but they won't be there to long.

It's a big relief! The next option was full brain rads wich has more side effects. So we were really praying for the gamma knife. There is a possiblitiy they could do it again but not as likely. All we can do is hope and pray that this worked and when they change my chemo late Jan that it will do the trick to keep the mets at bay. I have family in form out of town so may not be able to get on as often. But please let me know that my prayers and thoughts are with you. Hugs & Prayers & Happy Holidays",

It is not brain tisse that has gone bad. Because of the number of spots it may not be best to go the Gamma Knife route but rather to go the whole brain radation route and if need to done the road go gamma knife. They did another MRI today with a finer look to see if they can tell what the smaller spots are. At any rate I have a very hard and long road to recovery in front of me. Most likey I will have to quit working as some fuctions may be limited. it can be a few months to a year before we will know all of the affects. My goal right now is to maintain as much of a normal life as I can and spend time with family. I fell there is still a lot left for me to do and my time is not yet here. I ask that you keep my family in your prayers as this will be as hard on them as it will be on me. In some ways harder I think for them. Financially this id going to be very difficult but I trust the good Lord will see us through. I will know more in the days to come as to how we will proceed with treatment. Right now I'm going to concentrate on cleaning out my house and making things as simple as possible. I've got a lot of stuff to get rid of  and make room for family to be here if they want to be. well that's all I know for now Love Cy",

They felt it would be better to have them off so I can watch the sites for any signs of infection, that and the adhesive was tearing up my skin! The sites are tender but look really good! Better than the old site has ever looked! I did #15 last night. they used the new port but it took 3 times for them to get it accessed with good return, duh it was still swollen from the placement on Monday! I sure love the nurses that run the abraxane with the iv flush at the same time it sure makes it go much faster. The abraxane takes forever for them to mix and that can make for a long night. Haven't been real good at taking my L-Glutamine and man o live does the neuropthy flare up when I miss taking it. hope to keep this thread going for those that are looking at abraxane as I had trouble finding info on it when I was looking for it.

It's sold in the health food stores and isn't cheap. you can get it in capsules and in powder form. if yo can handle milk shakes the podwer is the cheapest way to go and mixes in the shakes well.

I also take the neurontin, 900mg but I take it all at night when I go to bed, cause it does make me dizzy. I actually started taking it for the hot flashes over a year ago.  The l-glutamine is a free form amino acid that helps the muscles. A lot of body builders use it right after exercise to help keep the muscles from breaking down. I'm suppose to take 10g 3 times a day which is 18-20 capsules each time or about 2 tablespoons of the powder. I can't drink shakes so I take the pills. It's a bit pricey so I get the powder and fill the capsules myself. I haven't heard about b-6 or glucosomine helping I'll have to ask my onc if I can take those. I finished all the antibiotics they had given me and the old port site is still seeping so they gave me more antibiotics and they will check it tomorrow and the onc will see me next week unless it gets worse!

In April I was dx'd with liver mets. they choose this combo for me in weekely doses of the abraxane and every other week of the avastin. Aug 31 I got the new that the combo is WORKING! the tumors are shrinking! I have to continue the treatments for another 12 weeks before they will do the scans again. Hopefully Thanksgiving will bring more good news. Is anyone else doing this weekly? Smile you will surely make someone day!

I just covered the ones on my fingers with badaides to keep them from rubbing. they got hard then they peeled. I didn't have them long though. My markers have been elevated but I hear that is not uncommon while in treatment. I am having problems with the port incesion site. it never heald fully and got infected twice in the last month. Now I have to go back to the Dr. that put it in to have him decide if my body is rejecting it and if I'll need a new one. I hope not. I never had any problems with my first one. Sometimes wish I never had it taken out. I've now done 13 abraxane and 5 Avastin since the end of May. I've only missed 4 weeks of treatement in all that time. The first because the neuropothy was so bad.  They lowered the dose after that, the second to give me a break when I flew back to NY and the 3 & 4th because my port site was infected. Abraxane is doable, I have what I call chemo nose which means it runs a lot and leaky eyes both of which I experianced with CMF when I did that last year. Hope everyone is doing well",

I've been surprised to see how much hair has grown back this last month. I wonder if I'll loose it again! I know hair grows in 3 month cycles. I got rashes but I thought they were from the Abraxane. They come and go. Mostly on the hand and elbows,(which was new for my onc). Benadryl helped  I know they  lowered the amount of Abraxane when the neuropthy got so bad I couldn't walk. My port site is still abecessing in one spot and I have to remove the top layers of scabs so that it can drain twice a day and now it's infected up the catheter again. The On Cal Onc was nice enough to call in a RX rather than make me go to the ER. Which made me really happy as I had family plans today and didn't want to cancel but if I had gone to the ER I would have had to because I would have been to tired. Wow Cjay over a year on this. I sure hope you get the 6 months stable and this has done the trick for you.",

They will check it next week and decide if they are going to hold it nect week. guess we are going to do this week by week until we see some improvement. She ordered CT's and another Bone scan to check the progress before I see the Onc again next month. Just waiting to get the dates scheduled. My hair is growing back nicely. I don't wear the scarves and hats now unless I'm outside cause it's cold out now. Hope everyone is doing well Hugs & Prayers",

There are many reasons a marker can go up, you may have just had a cold or maybe the flu shot or taken more tylonal than before. so don't let the markes get you down they are just tools to help the guide the Onc.",
