He won't leave until mum passes which we are expecting to happen within days. I've heard stories of people holding out for something or someone and as her doctor is so surprised she survived Friday night I thought maybe she's holding out to \"say goodbye\" to her grandson. I placed him against her side and wrapped her arm around him and although she is completely sedated and not moving she gently held onto Jaxon's leg and then let out a whimper like cry, I have no doubt she knew he was with her and I'm now praying that's all she needed to now let go. I would give anything to be by her side when it happens but I have a feeling she will save that special moment for just her and dad.",

November 2012 scans revealed 'major metastatic skeletal progression' so started chemo. I had 3 cycles of Paclitaxel/Gemzar & then scans showed slight progression of bone mets but it had spread to liver. So now on cycle 2 of Xeloda, scans after cycle 3 to see if it's working! Fingers crossed! Hugs to everyone. Karen x",
