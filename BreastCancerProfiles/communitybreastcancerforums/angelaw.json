Kept the skin and nipple bc brca2 positive and therefore preventative.  The onc said that the studies show 2% risk of reoccurance associated with the nipple sparing.  But the studies are older and from a time that the masectomies were performed with incision under breast and were not as efficient at scraping off all the tissue.  Anyway, kept my nips and they are still with me.  Oh: the nips are ok. The one on the left is not centered bc had small infection on the incision over that nip.  No feeling but they do \"pop up\" when touched.  They do show through on a tee shirt, also.

      "Content": "Apr 19, 2008 03:20PM - edited Apr 19, 2008 03:31PM by angelaw Hi: I had similar family history.  it took my sister (second dx with breast cancer) to get the genetic testing done.  She was positive. You can order the test kit from Myriad (on-line site) if your doctor does not have the test kit.  all major hospitals have a genetic counselor (covered by insurance usually) who can help you with the odds determination, discuss your risk aversion, and do the test for Myriad.  It takes about two weeks to find out the results.  My one sister (stage 3) was BRCA2 positive.  My other sister (stage 1) was BRCA negative.  Go figure.  Anyway, I tested positive.  I had just nursed my sister (stage 3) through her surgery.  she was heading into chemo and rads.  I chose to have the prophaletic masectomies right away.  Very happy with my choice because:  I didn't want to wait for IT (advised my risk factor was at the high end of the scale - 85% - because brca positive; lcis; abnormal cells on ductal lavage; and high saturation of bc in my family); I didn't have time for the semi-yearly testing and drama to \"keep an eye on it\"; and I never wanted to go through chemo or rads.  I was back at work under two weeks after the masectomies.   A genetic counselor will help you with your decision.  Each of us makes our own choice: What was right for me may not be right for you.  We each have different backgrounds, support, and fears. It felt better once I talked to a genetic counselor to find out all my options and what they meant in managing risk.  Prayers are with you. ",
