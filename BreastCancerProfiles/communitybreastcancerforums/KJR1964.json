Appointment with the BS last week on Thursday and back in the same boat... Waiting... Waiting and Waiting... I was sent for another ultrasound because of shadowing...Also BS said original lump was more likely 3cm... Another 3 core biopsies to a spot found 3cm away from the main lesion and come back next week for results that will have a bearing of what sort of surgery/treatment would be needed... Chemo first was mentioned... BS Nurse said \"BS doesn't usually mention that unless she is thinking it..\". I am still at a horrible stage, thinking the worst and just wanting results... Sorry just venting and giving an update... also would love this to be for my own records... So much more to say but can't think at the moment..",

But the waiting list here in Western Australia for public patients is quite long (about a month) and I am now worried about whether it will spread ... Have just posted in Just Diagnosed Thread with full details.. Any information or advice would be most appreciated.. Karen :) ",

Trying to stay strong...But with all the symptoms I had leading up to the testing I can only think that I may not here them.. A brief history of the circumstances why I find myself here... I am 49 ... Hit the big 50 in May... Quite looking forward to it...Had planned a little trip to Bali .. Which is where my story began.. Three weeks ago I was getting ready to jump on a plane in the morning and I noticed my Left Nipple slightly indented and swinging to the right... I immediately put my arm up I don't know why but as I did I noticed a deep indentation just below the nipple.. My other lady was perfect...  Mmmm I went out to my hubby and said \"somethings not right\" but nothing was going to take away my holiday.. So on the plane we got... One week later I was booked into getting a Squamous Cell Carcinoma cut out from my neck... it was small but something that had just appeared.... 20 stitches later it was gone... Come back in a week to remove stitches...Ok should make an appointment to check out that malformation in my breast... I have explained what happened next.. Big roller coaster ride.. and its not over yet.. another two sleeps.. Sarajane7374... Ultrasound Man a Tech... Radiologist Lady not sure... Both said they had consulted with their superiors in Head Office (Perth) ...Handed my biopsy in a jar to take to the Path Lab 500 metres away (otherwise you would have to pay) my ultrasound pics and my mamagram pics with the words \"your surgeon will need to see these\"... I really can only think the worst... P.S.  I could never feel the lump... which is apparently 2cm ...until I leant over and queezed my breast in the area... And yes it is there.. All I could feel was a thickening of the area.... Thinking that I was pre-menopausal I actually thought that was it... Trying to stay positive...reading everyones posts and all I can say is there is some very, very brave and inspiring women on this forum... P.S.S.. Thanks for listening",
