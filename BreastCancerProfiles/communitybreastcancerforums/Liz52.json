I feel good! Believe me, going through chemo isn't as bad nowdays as it used to be. I never once got sick or queasy at all. They give you anti-nausea medications right in your IV before they even begin the chemo, and then they give you more for at home. I was fine the whole time. Yes, I lost my hair, but it grew right back. The radiation treatments did make me tired, but my husband helped out around the house a lot. I'm glad I did it, because now I don't have to wonder whether there are bad little cancer cells in there multiplying that might have been missed during the surgery. My doctors were wonderful, and today I feel 100% again. Don't let your fear keep you from getting the treatment you should have. Best of luck to you! Liz",
