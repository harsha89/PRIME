Last night when I took a shower I noticed that I started to have somwthing like small pimples around the nipple it was not there before - any idea of what I should tell the dr tomorrow? I read somewhere that sometimes dr can just give u a cream without checking the possibility of cancer Any help would be great Thanks",

I am 30 years old never had any issues with my breast not even any pain before or during my period. The last 2 weeks I have an itch on my left breast that doesn't go away, I read somewhere that it might be dry skin which I don't have but I still made sure to put lotion on it but it doesn't help. I also have a bit of a weird feeling in my breast I can't really explain it it's like until 2 weeks ago I didn't really felt anything in my breast but now I constantly feel something (just a feeling not actual lumps) which bring me to the other point I tried to search for lumps but to be honest I have no idea how to do it and I can't tell whats going on. I think if I am not wrong my skin feels maybe different than the right breast but honestly can't tell for sure. I was wondering if you think it's normal even when I never expirenced it before? Or should I see a dr? If so a family dr or an obg dr? As far as history my grandma passed away from breast cancer and my mom constantly had lumps in her breast but they were all banain thank god. I appreciate your help, I know this site is for those who have cancer but I just wanted to ask someone who might have more expirence. Thank you Michelle Log in to post a reply",
