I like your description of a woodpecker picking at your head (I may borrow that if you don't mind). Try your Hardest to find things that distract you or calm you while you wait. Exercise is a great way to burn up some of that excess anxiety and you get the added endorphin benefit. And I agree with everyone else, see if they can put you on a cancellation list so you have the possibility of getting an earlier appointment. I hate to say it, but the one consistency I found in all this breast anxiety is that nothing happens quickly and no matter how long the wait, it's excruciating. You are not alone!",

I was very anxious about having to be in one position for too long because I had had a terrible back flare up a few days before the procedure (landing me in the ER). I did fine though. They had a tough time getting me positioned so that they could get to the cluster because it was so deep, but after 20 minutes of manipulating, squashing, repositioning, pulling, etc., the biopsy went off without a hitch. I literally felt nothing. I did tell them that my right breast was going to be hanging about 2 inches lower than my left after all that, but alas, it sprung back into place nicely... ha! I left wrapped in an Ace bandage with an ice pack tucked in there and never took anything stronger than a Tylenol. I think the hardest part of all of this is the waiting and anticipation. In an odd way, my back flare up and pain from that probably provided me with some much needed distraction from the anxiety of having the procedure (although I wouldn't recommend this approach). I wish you the very best and pray for a good outcome!",
