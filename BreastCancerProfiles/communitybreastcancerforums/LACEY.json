Had hysterectomy. Such horrible menopause I did not take the Arimidex..now I guess I am going to pay for my stupidity. Had mammo and us last Weds. found 1 5x6x4mm solid mass irregular edges, no other masses or cystic images close to it(same breast as last time) found new calcifications in the other side (same way cancer presented in other side last yr.) Have appt. with Breast surgeon on the 5th. Then biopsy. Anyone had this and it was b9? I have some tenderness and of course that \"wad of tissue\" feeling under my arm, (one that was treated) Can something have grown that quick? wouldn't Rads kill all cells? no node involment last time. Guess I am looking for similar stories. Thank you ladies, and God bless. Log in to post a reply",

Anyway, the radiation scars and stuff were mentioned in the report, that was at 11:00 area, this is at 3:00. Although thank you for that thought as it could maybe be something from radiation. I think the tenderness is definitly from the rads as I have had it ever since. I was given a May 30th appt at the surgeon but my Mom is coming in from NJ that morning and I have not seen her in 2 years, so I didn't want our first stop to be the Dr. She already thinks I am going to die. Seriously, she is a real balloon popper. Anyway, I do hate to wait, and I will insist on a quick biopsy after the consult. In fact I am going to ask for excisional biopsies I want whatever it is OUT. Thank you again for your caring. I hope you are at a good place in your treatment. Are you still in treatment? Hope all goes well, and this to will make you stronger, you just give the impression of a heads on kind of person. That's what it takes to beat this crap.",
