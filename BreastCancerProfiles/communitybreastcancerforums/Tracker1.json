Had BR years ago and they are calling a large lump fat necrosis although elected to not biopsy after MRI ok. 6 month f/u ok, 1 year f/u ok, they said the microcalcs had decreased. Now area of concern has grown larger, become more nodular, spikey, tender under spikey area, thicker. Breast indentation is larger, left armpit is insanely itchy. To MD today, she is very concerned but I melted down during long discussion of need for another MRI as I know interventional radiologist will want mammo, dx mammo, U/S although MD says due to major architectural distortion, scar tissue causing microcalcs, results of those are not reliable, but neither is MRI 100%. I cannot take another 20 years of this guessing game, bills, worry etc. Am ready to see a BS and get mass cut out but MD says that starts scar tissue, microcalc new areas of concerns, more testing. I said ok, am ready to get breast removed. Lump is about 5 inches by 2 inches large. I watched my 21 yr. old sister die of rare bone cancer so that taints my thinking. I tried to stay calm when Birads 5 came, tried the watchful waiting after MRI ok. Now 2 yrs. later am at a loss what to do. I asked about biopsy and MD said mass so large could come back fat necrosis on one end but miss cancer cells on other end. Log in to post a reply",
