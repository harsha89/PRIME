    "Content": "Readyforliving wrote: I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in June 2009, admitedly it was a huge shock, only recently just having had my second child Alfie and having a four year old Molly it certainly makes you think about your own mortality. However I knew that I had to get though it for my family and proceeded with the chemotherapy which all in all went OK, I then had to face surgery, I was having a lumpectomy and removal of infected lymph nodes. My surgery went ahead on the 30th November, but unfortunatley my histology results identified that there was not enough clearance and therefore I was scheduled for a wider excision on 21st December.Â  At last I thought this part of my treatment was over, however I recently had my histology results from my second operation to be told that they had found further microscopic cells of cancer and suggest a mastectomy. I now have to face a mastectomy on the 25th January and to follow five weeks of radiotherapy. At first I was positive and felt that I had three stages to go through, the chemo was really successful and reduced my cancer by nearly 70%, to follow the lumpectomy and then the radiotherapy. But it would seem I keep getting knocked again and again, and now have to face a mastectomy, dont get me wrong I am not alone and have a very supporting husband and family, but how much can one person really take..... I want to be positive about this next step but I cant seem to control this fear of the way I am going to look, I know that more importantly the Cancer will be eradicated but I cant help this feeling of helplessness....
