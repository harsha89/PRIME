It is so scary right now that you might need some RX support for the panic you feel. Most likely those lumps are nothing, but after loosing a baby life would be unbearable, so get back to the DOC. Also, why are you alone at this time? Family and friends should make sure you have someone with you.",

She has a daughter in the area, but not so close that daily visits would work, and we are right across the street. I made lots of soups and such and froze them in one serving sizes. Stocked her freezer, preprogramed my number in her phone, and hugged her when she wanted. Since I was only months ahead of her my energy was only slightly better than hers, but the idea that I thought ahead for her ment so much. Then again, there were the middle of the night I am scared to death calls. Let her know you don't care what time she calls. Some nights I was not very awake, but letting her vent helped her. I even know there were nights were I started out awake, and hubby ended up hanging up for me as I fell back asleep. The main thing for her was that I wanted to be there, not that I didn't make it through the call. You will find the right thing to do.",
