I am looking FORWARD to being done with all this in February and hopefully will start regaining some stamina.",

Opposite of what happened with TAC. One reason I reduced the decadron was the horrible crash I had.  I hope that is what is going on with your mom - if she was that energized from the decadron then she probably is just crashing and should be better soon. I'm sorry she is going through all this.  The fatigue I get with this chemo is much less than TAC but it seems to last longer.  The trial nurse told us yesterday that they are hearing really good things about this chemo.",
