She was dx'd with late Stage III, early Stage III breast cancer, from her Pathology report, it is a mix of IDC, ILC and DCIS, 3 tumours, the biggest was 3.1 cm, 22/33 lymph nodes positive for cancer, ULMX on September 11, 2015. She was diagnosed on August 27, 2015. The surgeon said he got it all out which is great. Now she will have Chemo (6 rounds, 6 months), Hormone Therapy (1 month) and Radiation (1 month). It is such a hard situation to be in, I can't even imagine if it was me that had the breast cancer. I would love to take it all away from her but she would worry about me the same way anyways :) All of you are such strong individuals. I commend you on your positivity and bravery. Mel",
