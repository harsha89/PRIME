I am not looking forward to it, but it is necessary. I don't want to go through what my mother did with ovarian cancer. She got through the breast cancer fine but didn't get herself checked for possible ovarian. She suffered greatly from ovarian and actually died from a reaction to the chemotherapy. I have not seen the oncologist yet, am waiting until after the surgery to find out if I need to have chemotherapy. I hope and pray that I don't have to go that route, but am taking one thing at a time. I am in great health and in the process of losing weight (30 pounds so far) so I am hoping that I'll be able to get back to a \"normal\" life soon. I have a positive attitude through this journey, which I hear helps in better outcome and have my Faith, which really helps. I am here for anyone that needs encouragement and a friend!",
