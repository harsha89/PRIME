      "Content": "Apr 1, 2014 05:30PM - edited Apr 1, 2014 05:47PM by LngDstncNuWife2012 Hello ladies!   I am a mother of 4 (girls 26, and 24, twin boys 19), I married my wonderful, dear husband (who I met long distance) in July 2012.  I like many have been reading posts learning of others shared experiences.  I noticed the \"Starting Chemo in April 2014\" post and thought this is where I should be!  Like ColdInCanada, my story was quite similar.  I went in for my annual mammogram and an area on my chest/ breast area I was concerned about 2 years prior was finally picked up on the mammogram.  Previously, the ultrasound tech could not pick up the area of concern on the mammogram film.  I was biopsied and confirmed later that afternoon it was DCIS in my left breast.  I was immediately referred to the surgical oncologist..   The initial suggestion by the surgical oncologist was to have a lumpectomy until the surgeon discussed the clear margins and how much area would have to be removed on such a small breast.  By my next visit with her, I had decided I wanted to have a double mastectomy and get it over with. I was then referred to the plastic surgeon upstairs who I met with that same afternoon - who by the way was wonderful!   My entire team are female doctors and absolutely amazing!  They were very patient and have explained everything so far every step of the way.  The plastic surgeon's office scheduled my surgery before I left her office that day.  THAT WAS FAST!  Once week post-op, the surgeon called with the results of the pathology report.  DCIS also in the right breast as well as stage 1 IDC in the left breast.  She didn't think my treatment plan would change from the 5-year Tamoxifen.  On the contrary,  my follow-up with my medical oncologist, I discovered the IDC is an aggressive cancer that would require chemo as well as targeted therapy in addition to the Tamoxifen.  WHAT A BLOW!  I am scheduled to have my first dose of Chemo April 11th.  I will have the port-o-cath inserted in my chest on April 3rd under general anesthesia.  Need I say how I feel about the unknown? I have a 5K breast cancer walk I plan to participate in this Saturday the 5th.  I hope to go about my days as normal as possible.  I appreciate you ladies for sharing your experiences.  This is a journey for us all and to share experiences and get encouragement from so many others who share similar stories is wonderful!  Oh!  I forgot to mention, I am participating in a study using the cold cap.  Although I'll be part of the study, I found about it too late and cut my hair really short.  It'll be nice to be able to keep the hair I have though.  The other thing- I've been asked to do a interview with Fox  News on the cold cap.  My cold cap experience will be filmed at my first chemo treatment.   Not sure when it will air, but I'll be on the lookout. Thank you for listening and posting!!!  ",

SE FREE but eating a LOT more!  OMG - I gained 6lbs so far.  Not bad thing, because I lost 10lbs after surgery.  I just hope I don't continue to gain at this rate after each infusion!  I guess if I do, I'll have to kick it into high gear and work out/ more!  Did you get that?  LOL 9AM this morning will be my 2nd infusion!  After this - I'll be halfway through!  It seems this can't happen fast enough.  I only hope this infusion is as uneventful as the 1st as well as minimal to no SE's!  A girl can HOPE right?  :-)  To the ladies who have infusions this morning, Good Luck and Blessings to YOU!  WE WILL GET THROUGH IT FINE! To ALL who are HERE - Be strong, use whatever avenue of support you have!  It sometimes helps to talk about it.  I talked so much with my family and husband about it (my experiences, research I've done, feelings, etc,)  I hadn't spent time online listening to you or sharing with you wonderfully amazing women what we are all going through!  Pictures!  I plan on posting soon!  Hope to get some at infusion this morning.  Sunshine- My name is Michele, I will send you a friend request on FB.  I'd love to see your pics.  I will post  mine here.  I haven't quite shared with many on FB my cancer news.     Well, It's about time for me to get ready .  I'll post again later today or tomorrow. Here's to successful treatment plans with positive results!    Hve a fanfastic day ladies! Talk to you soon! Michele ",

Not so much the insertion, but the idea of me having new body jewelry knowing it's there!  How is yours?  Is it uncomfortable or annoying? I LOVE your hats!  Sparkly is always the best!  I KNOW you will definitely look like a princess with it on!  I totally understand the excitement about your hat collection.  Knowing that chemo is in the plan, we automatically prepare ourselves to possibly lose our hair.  I actually did the same thing, I cut my hair short to prepare to possibly lose all of my hair and I too hats and wraps on the way!  I'm going shopping tomorrow for a few more things to wear for my head.  Although I'm wearing the cold cap, I'm sure I'll have days I won't feel like messing with hair - so I'll have my hats and jeweled wraps to get me through.  :) 60K cancer walk?  WOW!  Impressive!  It's nice you were able to walk with a friend and meet others on the journey.  Mine is only 3K; my family will walk with me.  My PS was reluctant to letting me participate since I am 5 weeks post-op from the DIEP flap surgery.  I promised I would take it slow; I've been looking forward to participating for a few months now. I wish you well on your 1st chemo treatment - he's hoping it's smooth and uneventful! I'll check on you between your treatment and mine! Many hugs to you and everyone else! ",
