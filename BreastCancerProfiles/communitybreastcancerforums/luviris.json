I went for my routine mammo which was abn.and was sent for a more extensive one. that led to a biopsies in both breast ( I ended up allergic to any type of tape :( ) Then a breast MRI which showed more areas of concern. Now I am waiting for a MRI breast biopsy of both breast. This has benn 3 months of worry.  Very hard to put it all out of your mind. Of course since I am 56 and post menopausal I had to be taken off of the patch. The hot flashes have not been a problem, they seem to be gone, but I seem to have developed a short fuse and periods of weepiness. I guess this is all normal. Here it is 1:41 am and I am on the web. So glad to have found this websight.  ",
