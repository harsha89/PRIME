      "Content": "Dec 20, 2008 01:00PM - edited Dec 20, 2008 01:01PM by ENFENETEE Hey Everyone, Busqueen- Thanks for asking. I was heavily sedated during the procedure. All I remember is talking to the Doctor, then the anesthesiologist and then nighty night. When I woke up in recovery they immediately did an x-ray on me. They said it came back fine and then they discharged me. I'm aching and sore. It hurts when I lift my arm up on the port side but it's getting better. After my mastectomy I had no pain and didn't take any pain medication after I went home. Now I am faithfully taking my pain medication. I guess it's just different for everyone. It still freaks me out knowing I have a port and catheter in my chest. I am scared to move. Last night I slept like a mummy. I am happy that I have the port because they had a time accessing a vein for the port procedure. They ended up using a vein on my wrist because they tore the other ones up at the hospital when I had my mastectomy. My veins are very small and the needles they used at the hospital were so big that they infiltrated into my muscle. How long did it take you  to get used to get used to your port?  I start chemo on 12/22 so I guess I better get used to it sooner than later, lol.. ENFENETEE",

I am ready for chemo on Monday. They told me I should be prepared to be there 5-6 hours. I will be getting TC and H. Then on Tuesday I will get my Neulasta shot. I want to thank all of you because I 'm so prepared for this journey from your informative posts. I promise I will give the details of my port placement also.",

Out patient surgery for port installation ( I feel so robotic) 12/19.  Starting Taxotere/Cytoxan (4 cycles) with Herceptin during chemo and after for a year  12/22. Followed by radiation, I will then have the right breast removed and reconstructive surgery all at the same time  Stage II B, T2, N1, M0 E-, P-, HER2+ I was in a bad car accident 6/3/08 and they thought I had an hematoma. Was rushed to the hospital 10/18 with a fever of 102. The \"hematoma \" was aspirated then biopsied and I found out when I went back for my follow up that it was cancer. I thank GOD everyday for my accident!  ",
