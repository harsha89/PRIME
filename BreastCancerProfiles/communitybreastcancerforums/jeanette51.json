Hopefully, you are able to see a surgeon soon.   Good Luck!!  Keep us posted!!",

Pathology came back clear....0/13 nodes, both breasts benign...therefore, chemo saved my life!!  How was your first treatment?  It is a rough cycle of treatments, but you can do it!  Stay strong and hang in there!!!",
