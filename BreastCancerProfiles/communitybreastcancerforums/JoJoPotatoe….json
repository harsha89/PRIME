I met with my onco Thursday, who let me know all of my options. Of course, he wanted to change my mind, but did understand my decision. We discussed palliative treatments and gave me estimates on how long I will last without treatment. I will meet with him next week to give him my decision on the palliative tx. I also told my boyfriend about my decision. He did not know that I am State lV with extensive liver mets, and was in shock. He begged me to fight, but the next morning, after he slept on it he said he would support and not question my decision. However, I did agree that he could accompany me to my onco appointment next week. I will tell my children next week. That is going to be very difficult. My boyfriend and I have agreed that I will spend most of my remaining vacation time this year with my grandbabies, while I am still feeling pretty good. After the first of the year, I will spend 3 weekends a month with my children and grandbabies, alternating between each family. I will do that until I start really feeling lousy, and who knows when that will happen for sure.  I plan on continuing to work for as long as possible. I am glad I made this decision. I am a little scared, but strangely content also. Of course, I was hoping I would be able to start smoking again, eat fatty foods and drink like a fish! However, the onco, told me I would only be making myself more miserable. Darn!",

I don't think 1 year or 5 years will lesson the pain that my family and friends will feel.  I don't want them to have to suffer though all of this with no cure in sight.  They will be devastated by my death whether if it comes in 6 months or 6 years. I don't want my family to have the anxiety and false hope.  I don't want their lives to be centered around me having to fight the fight with me for an outcome that can only be one thing. My grandchildren will remember grandma as being sick, but will not remember me as being sick for a long time. That is what I want. I plan on no treatment what-so-ever.  Just pain meds when I need them.  I have not shed one tear since I made this decision and I feel very good about it.  My significant other will no doubt tell me that I will change my mind, but I know I will not.  I am only interested in staying comfortable.  I am curious on how long my onco will tell me I have left.  I am going to limit my appointments to only medication reviews and not have any scans, etc.  I will be looking to all of you for advice on meds and pain managment.  I do need the help.",
