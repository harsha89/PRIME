I got the all clear at the centerbut my dr called this afternoon with the report to let me know that a cyst had grown. It is a benign looking cyst. I asked if I should be concerned and he said that I could call a breast surgeon if it bracken bothersome or worrisome. I told him everything worries me lol. So I\u2019m not sure what I should do. For now I will just take a deep breathe!",

Also had a fibroadenoma. I was due for yearly mammo in December and never got to it. Due for screening mri in June. Was doing a breast exam. I haven\u2019t done one in a long time and felt a lump. That lump seems to be smaller but found a much bigger lump shortly thereafter. I have been waiting about two weeks for diagnostic mammo. That is tomorrow. I keep feeling this lump. I kind of feel like I need to chase it when feeling for it but it is big. And my breast feels weird. Kind of heavy. I am so anxious and scared. I am so mad at myself for not going to get my Mammo in dec. thank you for listening Log in to post a reply",
