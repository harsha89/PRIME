    "Content": "strongasmymom wrote: Hi ladies,  My mom was recently diagnosed with DCIS.  Because there are so many areas of this in her left breast and the high rate of recurrence in the other side she has opted for the bilateral mastectomy with reconstructive surgery, all in one surgery.  I was hoping to get some advice from all of you who have gone through this so that I can be as helpful as possible when I am home with her.  I already have some ideas about cooking meals ahead and freezing them,  taking care of her dogs for her ( she has 4).  I had initially planned on staying for 1 week as she is in NY and I am in CT regretfully.  But looking through some of the posts I am wondering if I should stay longer to help her out.  Any advise any of you fabulous strong women could share with me would be greatly appreciated.  I just want to be strong for my mom and make sure she doesn't have to worry about anything except healing.  Thank you all in advance for any advice you can give me.   Log in to post a reply",
