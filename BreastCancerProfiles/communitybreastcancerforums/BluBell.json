    "Content": "BluBell wrote: Hi, I am terrified right now and having horrible anxiety, about 2 weeks ago my left nipple started bleeding spontaneously. I do not have any pain in my breast but was recently diagnosed with a stage 2 cervical prolapse as well. I am 45 and in perimenopause and 2 yrs ago was diagnosed with dense fibrosistic breast and now this. My Obgyn has referred me out to a breast specialist due to the bleeding and I am terrified. I have not been diagnosed yet but am wondering if anyone else has experienced bleeding nipples and cervical prolapse in the same time period? am so agfraid this is all linked together. Thanks in advance for and words of wisdom. Log in to post a reply",
