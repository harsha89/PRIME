I'm 25 years old and I noticed that there is a red patches like a bug bite on my right breast I just thought it was because of my bra since I sweat more esp. when its really hot and bra is fitted so I put a nizoral cream for Fungi for 4days now and its almost 2 weeks now and it's still there at first it was just small like a 25cent(PH money) but now its like a One Peso Coin. I have an inverted nipple ever since so its hard for me to identify if it is an IBC or what and also sometimes my nipples are itchy both right and left but the red patches is only in the right breast. I dont know also if my breast is swollen because for me its look normal.  Now I am so worried because I don't hear any cases like this in the Philippines and I am so afraid to go to the doctor for a check-up.. :(",
