Hopefully the TPA will work and the port can be put to full use. Thirteen years ago, during first cancer, I had a Hickman Catheter that would not allow blood to be drawn from it so it seems to be my silly body causing the issues. For those on Gemzar, what is your cycle. My first plan was three weeks on,one off, but counts were too low for second dose so we skipped a week. The plan now is two weeks on at a lower dose, one off, so we will see if that works. We had planned to be in Florida for two weeks and now don't know whether to go for one week or just skip treatment and go for two. MO on vacation so can't get her advice. The trip is more for DH than me but can't say I wouldn't benefit from listening to the waves and hopefully feeling some sunshine.

There is no support group in this area and no palliative care programs. I have supportive friends but they don't understand how isolating this disease can be. I would love to be able to talk with others close in age about looking at the side effects of chemo compared to just letting the disease run its course and other issues we face. The last time I posted, I was on Xeloda but developed Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus ( a rash related to Lupus) so the Xeloda was stopped, a port put in and I am on Gemzar.

I know I can post on any of the threads and have on the Afinitor and Xeloda ones but I feel so bad complaining when I read the posts of the young ones who are dealing with this disease every day of their life and fighting to have a long life meanwhile holding down full time jobs and taking care of families..   Nothing I have to face is anything like what they face every day,  I would stop all treatment if I thought my doing so would save someone younger from this disease. So my question is, where are the \"elders\"?  How are they handling side effects and decisions about quality of life vs. quantity of life.  Maybe they have it all together and don't feel the need for support from others but I admit I need to share with others who are experiencing the same or similar things.  Yes, I have a supportive family and friends but no one who know's what it is like to live with this every day.   I went to the BC support group in town but they were all newly diagnosed and I think that they felt uncomfortable with my being there.  When I called to join an exercise group for women with BC, I was told that I would be welcome but maybe I shouldn't share my story. So I truly hope there is no one else in their 70's with MBC but I am not foolish enough to believe that, so I hope a few will post.  Otherwise I will continue to be a lurker, reading what other's post and learning from them.  I will still post if I have a question but not with complaints because compared to all of you who are younger, I have nothing to complain about.

Xeloda and Gemzar kicked them hard and hopefully for a long time. Finding articles on what is next after NED was not conclusive so I had to be patient ( not one of my strong points when it comes to health information). Anyway the MO said that the Standard of Care in not to change what is working so I will stay on Gemzar two weeks on and one week off. I think I knew that would be the case but I had let my mind dream about having less fatigue, not planning around chemo and being concerned with low blood counts. So the news is really great and I will really try not to complain about crummy collateral damage. Wishing all of you a time with NED. I have had 4 PET scans in the past year with no objections from Medicare and supplemental which is an Advantage Policy. The MO said they have more trouble getting them for diagnosis than re staging. Who knows, maybe it is if the insurance contact is in a good or bad mood that day. My MO also asked when the PET report came on My Chart, it was 5 days after test. She said that it is automatic and the Dr's have no contol over there release. She is like me in wanting to get her results right away but there apparently was an incidence when a patient read her biopsy report before the surgeon and when the news was bad, she was understandably upset so the whole procedure is under review. My theory is if you don't want to know, don't look but that might be a bit harsh. Yesterday was chemo and Dexadron day so being a bit wired,I best quit before I am banned for sharing t.m.i.",

This happened to be the weekend after second week of chemo when I simply can't stay awake. I try to keep going but if I sit down, I am immediately asleep. This is accompanied by a deep depression and this is \"incredibly lucky \". I'm not sure if our family and friends see us as they want us to be or if they are in denial. I am thankful that we can support each other here as I have learned not to look for support from family and even more so with friends who all seem to have their own physical issues. Maybe we all need to be more forthcoming about what we need but so far I haven't found that to work. I agree about how difficult this is (I tend to feel more compassion for anyone who is younger than me and is facing this disease) for the young ones and so wish for a cure or even more hope. No matter our age, we still want to be part of life, be appreciated and be cared about. It is part of being human and having real needs. ",

I also struggle with the amount of money it costs to treat this illness.  Yes, I want to live and yes I think staying alive is worth the cost (physical and monetary) but the \"just\" side of me says the $7000 in copay for medication the last three months could do so much good for others.  Instead of paying for medicine and copays for seeing the Onc. every other week, we could help pay college tuition or help someone who is struggling with paying their mortgage. These are things that weigh heavy on my mind during the quiet times or the times I can't sleep.  They are things I think about when I read the thread of those who have chosen to stop treatment and wonder if and when I should join them. But for now, I will keep doing what I am doing and know that I will know when the time has come to make this decision. Do any of the younger women who have read and posted have any suggestions on how we can help you.  I tried to start a giving tree at the Onc Center last year but it did not have many interested in helping.  I realize when we are dealing with our own illness, it may be the only thing we can focus on.   Having time to reflect and evaluate are one of the many gifts of retirement. I wish that all MBC patients will reach the age of 74 and have the opportunity to be retired not because they are on disability but because a cure has been found and they have managed to beat this disease and can enjoy the fruits of their labor. Please know that all of you are in my thoughts and prayers. ",

It is great your husband and daughters knowledgeable and can stay on top of things. My DH is a retired pulmonary and critical care physician. I have to remind him often that I need him to be my supporter not my Doctor but in his defense, he was the one who diagnosed the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. I will be anxious to hear about your hair loss. Hope the Coumadin keeps the blood clots away. Glenna, hope you are having a good weekend with your grandsons. Grandkids are one of the greatest blessings in life, we have six, five grandsons (ages 4-21) and one granddaughter. Three live in Idaho, two in Milwaukee (one is currently doing an internship in Washington DC. Our 11 year old grandson and his parents live near us which is a gift but now that he is in middle school, we don't see him very often, Maureen, what day is your scan? Want to send prayers and positive vibes your way - it is so hard to wait for results. My Day 1 is Tuesday. My anxiety level is up which is unusual for me, I can usually handle most things but knowing the list of options is getting shorter is not easy to think about. Nausea has been constant the past few weeks; I imagine the liver doesn't like the tumors and is letting my body know. Do you get Decadron before Halavan? I hate steroids, I describe myself as wired and tired for a day or two after getting them. We just moved in mid January to a retirement community. They are building condos and we moved into the first building - we are living in a construction zone. The workers arrive every day at 6:30 a.m. and want to be sure we know their here. Anyway, after we moved in, we kept finding bees that were dead or almost dead. Seems like there is a colony of bees in the rafters or walls of our unit. We were able to close the openings where they were coming in but our neighbor who is a bee specialist tells us they have to get the bees out or we will have honey dripping down our walls and when the hive deteriorates, it will destroy the wood and draw other insects. So much for carefree senior living. With the temperature rising the bees will become more active so it could be an interesting week, new chemo and bees. Glad that you all have kept this thread alive and that Halavan will be good to all of us. Phyllis (also known as Crone, a wise woman ((aren't we all))",

Nine months on Gemzar was the longest time on any treatment, hoping for a new record. It is sad to see all of you leaving not only because the treatment has failed but also that there are so few of us. I asked the chemo nurse why there seemed to be so few on the drug and she said most people don't get this far on the list. I'm not sure that means we have been in treatment for longer or is it because we are going through the list faster. How are you doing emotionally? I find the ups and downs harder to handle. One week we are talking about stopping treatment and the next celebrating the drop in tumor markers. My husband gets so up and starts planning trips and I try to be excited but reality keeps pushing into my emotions. Usually I am pretty upbeat and hopeful but not right now. Maybe it is the grey skies I have been reading through the past posts to see who is moving on from Havalen.? If you are moving on, how long were you on Havalen? Hoping for blue skies and good results from whatever treatments we are on with minimal side effects. Phyllis ",

It is my body that is quitting, don't mean to be dramatic but when you look at side effects and at the bottom of the list are the very rare side effects, that's what I get. Had to quit after one round of Afinitor, I did not have mouth sores but mouth craters. The breast cancer specialist had never seen such a reaction and insisted I stop. Next Xeloda, developed Acute subcutaneous lupus Erythematosis which can progress into full blown Lupus. On Gemzar, Hemolytic Uremic syndrome landed me in the hospital and off chemo for awhile. Anyhow, my body does not tolerate medicine well and all the side effects have taken quite a toll. I had a low grade fever for 10 days after first dose of Halavan, still have mouth sores and yesterday my hair started coming out by the handfuls. If my ANC is over 1000, I am going to try a lower dose after we get back from DC. Life is full of good things along with hard times and I want to keep going but I do need a reality check now and then. Suzanne, I appreciate your pep talk and will hang onto it when we face the decision to stop or continue the Halaven. Lovely picture Glenna; grandchildren are all wonderful but holding a baby one is very special and comforting. Both ladies in the picture are beautiful. I love her chubby cheeks. I have a goal to knit baby blankets and store them for when great grandchildren come. Have two scarves to finis first. Maureen, I hope the Gem/cis is a keeper for you. I was able to take Gemzar longer than any other treatment. It is interesting to look at the list of drugs we each have been on and the order we received them. Maybe it is what's on the \"blue light special\" that month. Once again, thank you for the support. It is so nice to have people to talk with who understand.

After saying all that the Halaven was amazing. I had a short trial with Pablo but my platelets dropped to 35 and my tumor marker went to 1400. Halaven was started in March and after 30 days, t.m (Ca27 - 29 C) was 281 and dropped to 51.7 in July. Due to side effects, the dose had to be lowered twice and I am currently on the lowest dose. Side effects have been low counts, neuropathy of feet and hands, fatigue and one that isn't listed as a side effect, Mucositis of the colon. As my internist explained, the lining of the colon is like the hair producing cells and the cells in the mouth that lead to mouth sores. It was extremely painful and in NOT a usual side effect of the drug. My scan in July showed liver tumors shrinking, and bone mets healed. Unfortunately the last three tumor markers have been going up so I will have a scan on Oct. 13th, Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. I will go to the imaging center with copies of 13 things you should know about Metastic Breast Cancer to hand out to the staff. I wish I had a copy to hand the person who took my vitals yesterday. She asked how I felt and I said \" like I had chemo last week\". As she walked out the door she said \"well it will be better soon\" Wishing much success on Halaven to all of you, without the Mucositis, it might have been the easiest since hormone therapy.",

I know I can post on any of the threads and have on the Afinitor and Xeloda ones but I feel so bad complaining when I read the posts of the young ones who are dealing with this disease every day of their life and fighting to have a long life meanwhile holding down full time jobs and taking care of families..   Nothing I have to face is anything like what they face every day,  I would stop all treatment if I thought my doing so would save someone younger from this disease. So my question is, where are the \"elders\"?  How are they handling side effects and decisions about quality of life vs. quantity of life.  Maybe they have it all together and don't feel the need for support from others but I admit I need to share with others who are experiencing the same or similar things.  Yes, I have a supportive family and friends but no one who know's what it is like to live with this every day.   I went to the BC support group in town but they were all newly diagnosed and I think that they felt uncomfortable with my being there.  When I called to join an exercise group for women with BC, I was told that I would be welcome but maybe I shouldn't share my story. So I truly hope there is no one else in their 70's with MBC but I am not foolish enough to believe that, so I hope a few will post.  Otherwise I will continue to be a lurker, reading what other's post and learning from them.  I will still post if I have a question but not with complaints because compared to all of you who are younger, I have nothing to complain about.

They all respond differently. How old is too old to get chemo? Not sure why but as I was getting chemo today, I asked the nurse how old was their oldest patient getting chemo. She thought for awhile and said 78 or 79. This started me thinking and I wonder how long it is reasonable to continue chemo. Do you base it on how you feel or if it's working or does age fit into the decision? Interested to hear what others think. ",

I am also glad to see this thread alive again, I thought it was just getting buried deeper into the discussion and that I was the only one who wanted to connect with Stage IV women/ men who are older and dealing with issues related to this disease. I still think of myself as active as do my family and friends but not as active as two years ago when we had a five bedroom home and I quilted and gardened but I an finding new pursuits. Sandilee, thanks for asking about my ongoing pain issue. It is thought to a lymph node that is or was pushing on the Illei Ingual nerve causing right sided lower abdominal pain, radiating to the inner thigh and to the muscles in the hip. The node may have shrunk but may have caused permanent damage. The pain comes after walking a short distance or after standing. It is relieved after sitting with my feet up. Hard to do when trying to take a walk around the neighborhood, guess I could act like I am stretching out. Wednesday will be my first scan in 6 months, the MO was trying to establish a two week on one week off . Because of low counts, that took months until they added Neulasta.",

I have posted on other threads/ topics especially when I have a question regarding a treatment or side effect. Where I struggle is with voicing my issues/ complaints when I have it \"easier\" then the young women who are facing this disease. This is not to say that my issues are any easier but as much as I want to continue living I have seen all our kids grow up, graduate from college, get married and have children. The young ones may never have that opportunity - what they face has to be so very much harder. They still have to work and car pool and comfort more than be comforted. If I am having a bad day, I can say to DH, your in charge of dinner. ( That may actually sound better then it is. We are talking about a man who spent most of his life on call and in the intensive care unit. He learned to clean a toilet at age 75 and is beginning to master chopping an onion. His notorious comment which I threaten to put on his headstone is \"Housework can be strenuous\". ). Back to the topic, all of you younger women and men deserve a cure, a chance to live a full, complete life. A chance to complain about joints aching from old age, not from chemo side effects. And yet I find I need support and community and this is one place where we all understand what the others are facing and I don't feel quite so bad saying I really feel bad today. Recently my DH who is a bit more traditional in his faith- spirituality than I, told me that he was praying to this person to cure me because that person needed one more miracle to be named a saint. I don't often get angry but this time I did. I said that is wrong, if you want to pray for a miracle then you pray for a cure for all MBC patients and not just for me. I think he understands now. So I think we all still post on multiple threads but ( I am speaking justfor me) saying this is hard to someone who is in a similar situation is more comfortable than saying this is hard to someone who has so much more to face than I do.

My last scan showed no evidence of disease recently after being in treatment for two years,but since then my tumor markers are creeping up, they have always been good indicators. Hearing I was NED was wonderful but then hearing I would continue on Gemzar two weeks on, one off took a bit of the joy away. Sometimes I find myself wondering which is worse, the disease or chemo.

We have four adult children, all with spouses and three with children. I can be very open with three of them but the youngest doesn't want to talk about my illness and has not told his older children (ages 9 and 12) about my diagnosis even though his daughter ( only grand daughter and we are close.) I'm ok with letting him be where he is but I hope he won't have regrets later. I would like to help him express his feelings but know I can't change him. I have participated in The Conversation Project and feel that I can be upfront with my wishes and desires with all but him. PBS has had some programs recently on cancer. One I just watched and would reccomend is Being Mortal featuring Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer. He has written a book with the same name, Being Mortal ( medicine and what matters in the end) which is on my reading list.

I know I can post on any of the threads and have on the Afinitor and Xeloda ones but I feel so bad complaining when I read the posts of the young ones who are dealing with this disease every day of their life and fighting to have a long life meanwhile holding down full time jobs and taking care of families..   Nothing I have to face is anything like what they face every day,  I would stop all treatment if I thought my doing so would save someone younger from this disease. So my question is, where are the \"elders\"?  How are they handling side effects and decisions about quality of life vs. quantity of life.  Maybe they have it all together and don't feel the need for support from others but I admit I need to share with others who are experiencing the same or similar things.  Yes, I have a supportive family and friends but no one who know's what it is like to live with this every day.   I went to the BC support group in town but they were all newly diagnosed and I think that they felt uncomfortable with my being there.  When I called to join an exercise group for women with BC, I was told that I would be welcome but maybe I shouldn't share my story. So I truly hope there is no one else in their 70's with MBC but I am not foolish enough to believe that, so I hope a few will post.  Otherwise I will continue to be a lurker, reading what other's post and learning from them.  I will still post if I have a question but not with complaints because compared to all of you who are younger, I have nothing to complain about.

Of course because I am still trying to keep hair my normal color so I was scheduled for color also. It was extra crazy at the salon because the salon is near a college campus and spring break started today and there were lots of young people getting hair cuts before they left for warmer places and I think they got a few laughs when they saw me after they took the towel off my head. Everything had gone well until we washed my hair, the color was perfect but my scalp was maroon. The chemo must be changing the skin and how it reacted to color. I sat there trying to look like of course this is what I wanted meanwhile thinking how hard my 10 yr old grandson would laugh tomorrow. Well thankfully, my super stylist came to the rescue put something on the scalp, had me sit for awhile and magically the color was gone. I may need to think about getting a new wig so I am prepared if this keeps happening.",

First diagnosis, i was treated with AC until I developed Cardiomyopathy from it, then taxol for six rounds ( developed neuropathy in fingers and toes). Radiation and then six rounds of CMF. Arimidex for seven years. Metastasis discovered in spring of 2013. Started on Aromasin, after two months developed allergic reaction ( hives and face swelling.) On to Letrazole until it failed after four months. Faslodex added and remained on the combination for six months until that quit working. Next came Afinitor. After two days on it, I developed what was described as mouth craters. Sent to see breast cancer specialist, who said that since the side effect developed so early, I wouldn't tolerate a dose reduction. Xeloda was next and it was working, reducing liver tumors but the rash that started with first dose was biopsied and was a lupus type reaction that rarely turns into full blown Lupus but koncologist, dermatologist and rheumatologist advised it be stopped. I feel like I am crossing options off the list quickly. I have been scanning all your posts for treatment and it seems so many of you have Herceptin as part of your protocol but I an not Hr2 positive. I am searching the web for a list of drugs so that I have some idea of what is left and can make informed choices. MO is suggesting Gemzar next but I don't find many posts about it. It would be very helpful if some of the you with liver mets would post your drug progression. Just need more info in order to prepare for what's ahead. I also have bone and lymph node involvement. ",

      "Content": "Crone wrote: My dh (retired physician) emailed this article from Medscape today.  Thought the line in the second paragraph describing advance breast cancer patients as \"a historically neglected population\" one of the truest statements I have read in some time. The latest international consensus guidelines for the management of advanced breast cancer were published online September 18 in the Annals of Oncology and September 20 in the Breast. The advanced breast cancer 2 (ABC2) guidelines urge more research and clinical trials into treatment for advanced disease, and describe advanced breast cancer patients as a \"historically neglected population.\" In particular, the guidelines note, more research is needed to find the best treatments for patients with breast cancer that has spread to the liver, pleural cavity, or the skin; patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who relapse during or shortly after adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab; patients with stage IV disease; and men with advanced breast cancer who require treatment with aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole. \"Our plea is for strong commitment from everyone involved \u2014 academia, the pharmaceutical industry, funders, and advocacy groups \u2014 to develop well-designed, high-quality, multidisciplinary trials for advanced breast cancer,\" said guidelines committee cochair Fatima Cardoso, MD, who is director of the breast unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center in Lisbon, Portugal. \"This is of critical importance, as many questions are still unanswered relating to management strategies, better drugs and drug use, and individualizing treatments so that they are specific to a particular patient and their tumor,\" Dr. Cardoso said in a statement. The guidelines were formulated by a group of experts from around the world who met at the second International Consensus Guidelines Conference on Advanced Breast Cancer in Lisbon in November 2013. The conference was organized by the European School of Oncology with the goal to improve outcomes for all patients with advanced breast cancer. Some 1100 participants from 71 countries attended, and the new guidelines were codeveloped by the European Society of Molecular Oncology. The ABC2 consensus guidelines contain several updates to the first set of guidelines, which were issued in 2011. One new focus is on inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, which occurs in 15% of breast cancer patients in developed countries and in up to 60% of patients in developing countries. \"There are very few clinical trials providing data for the best treatment of locally advanced breast cancer,\" Dr. Cardoso said. The ABC2 guidelines include new recommendations for triple-negative breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer, and hormone-receptor-positive disease. They also provide information gleaned from recent clinical trials on pertuzumab (Perjeta) and trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) for HER2-positive disease and everolimus (Afinitor) for hormone-receptor-positive disease. \"The care of women with metastatic breast cancer is highly variable around the world,\" ABC2 cochair Eric Winer, MD, director of breast oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, told Medscape Medical News. \"The guidelines that have existed, as far as I am aware, have largely been focused on the [American] population, or the United States and selected other countries. The ABC2 guidelines are designed to be useful to people around the world, in both economically advantaged and disadvantaged societies,\" Dr. Winer explained. He acknowledged that it might be difficult for the guidelines to be applied globally because of the disparity in resources that exist around the world, but many of them can be used regardless of a country's wealth. \"On some level, one can think of some of these as aspirational in some countries. But we have set out certain basic principles, such as multidisciplinary care and palliative care, which are universally applicable,\" he said. The committee that wrote the guidelines only recommended treatments for which solid evidence exists, Dr. Winer reported. \"We set forth what we thought would be the best possible care, and in some situations we were also able to make recommendations that in many societies would lead to somewhat less expensive care,\" he said. As an example, the guidelines suggest optimal frequency for imaging. Residents Salary & Debt Report 2014 View Report > \"Sometimes imaging tests are done too frequently,\" he said. Suggesting that CT scans and other imaging tests can be done less frequently could save money yet still provide effective screening, Dr. Winer explained. The ABC2 guidelines also emphasize the importance of nursing and psychosocial care, in addition to medical care, in the treatment of a patient with advanced breast cancer. \"These are patients who may live with this disease for many years in some situations, and for shorter periods of time in others, but there are real symptom management issues and psychological issues. If we are going to provide optimal care, it is going to take a number of different people to provide that care. Compared with the cost of some of the drugs we have, providing somebody with counseling and better symptom management may be well within the means of many countries,\" Dr. Winer said. Ann Oncol.
