On June 7 I had a CT scan and MRI of my head, both with IV contrast. I had my annual mammogram on June 20. My doctor's nurse just called and said there were \"gray areas\" showing on both breasts and that I need to go in for a different type of scan, and if that still shows a gray area, then have an ultrasound done at that time. I am 44 and have no history of any abnormal scans, and no physical concerns. (I've been getting routine annual scans since age 40). No family history of breast issues that I'm aware of. I am wondering, since the breasts are fatty tissue, could the contrast medium be stored in pockets and maybe that's what they're seeing? It's a long shot, but I'm hoping that's all it is, and just looking for others with similar experiences .... Thanks in advance for any guidance! Log in to post a reply",
