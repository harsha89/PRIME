I am trying to mentally and physically prepare for this. Impossible? I was shopping today at a store going out of business. Wow the deals I could get on mascara, shampoo and conditioners. I couldn't face buying any of it! Thinking I won't be needing it, :( Sort of got me depressed. I don't want to cry over this! really, but like I have come to find out, I don't always get to choose when to cry. Ah, well I feel better knowing that chemo is a precautionary step. My path report was clear, my margins clear. Just don't want that darn canc pest anywhere in me! I had the ends of my hair colored vivid red and dark blue. My way of coping I guess. I thought it would symbol my care free attitude! It's only hair! I think I will get it cut next week. Not pixie short yet, though most likely inevitable?",

I have my books, a magazine, my get well cards, going to get those cards put in an album. I'll take my IPad, music, pillows and a blanket. I would LOVE to sneak my dog Whiz in, lol. He is a cuddlier!

I've been home since about 9:00 this morning. The surgery center has the policy hey keep you 23 hours. Then it's home you go. Beautiful center, excellent care. Private room, one nurse on duty was my nurse, of course when shifts changed I got a new nurse, but they took excellent care of me. Didn't sleep too well until we got the temperature of the room better. Well, actually I was moved to a new room. I think the thermostat was broken it was so HOT, plus I had leg compression stockings, so sexy! Haha, well they didn't stay on too long. I needed to cool down to sleep. Keeping up,on Percocet and antibiotics. Drains are a bit annoying. Breast seems swollen, and little tender, otherwise managing well. I hope to sleep well tonight",

So today is the 16th, hair starts to come out 12-14 days after 1st round. That would put me roughly around May 1st. One lady I met last night, her girlfriends had a \"HAT\" party for her!

I hit snooze over and over every morning, barely to get up at 630. Almost always in bed by 9:00 p.m. I think some is my diet, or lack of diet hahah. Gray and brown days, blah. S glad spring is around the corner! Who knows, our bodies are still a mystery!? I am happy to read so many posts about post surgery! Thanks ladies! I feel better about my upcoming surgery. My biggest fear was the pain and scars. Keep up,with pain meds and all will be good. As far as scars, when do you get to actually see your breast unwrapped from bandages? I'm afraid to see bruising, stitches and other stuff? Good Luck to those having surgery this week, I will be sendings prayers, and hugs your ways.",

Stress led to lack of sleep, lack of sleep led to pain, pain led to miserableness! It is a sign of strength to ask for help, and admit we need the help/the prescriptions!",

Or I'm sorry, will it definitely cause damage? Or are there others reasons? Sorry, ignorant... I know how important having a chance to have a child is. I wanted children when I was in my twenties, four miscarriages later :( Now I am blessed with two step daughters, both well on the way to adulthood. I joke and say I'm glad their Mom gave birth to them for me! I also am blessed with two handsome young nephews, they're 6 and 2. I can spoil them and send them back to mommy. I love kids!",

Percocet seems to be keeping me comfortable, I also started ibuprofen in between doses of,Percocet. Today is my first post op with ps. I would be happy just for them to remove tape and bandages around where drains are inserted. Clean it all up and cover again if they have to. Itches, I hate tape! I might have just a slight aversion to it. Anyone else taking blood thinner post op? I've had to give myself a shot everyday, two more and I'm done. Giving myself a shot wasn't as hard as I thought. Leaves a bruise, so I have three different bruises on my tummy. Itches in those spots too. I have an elastic band around my waist to hold drains, getting tired of that daran thing! Itches too, guess I have delicate skin. Lol. Probably more aware of things because not enough to distract me. Prayers Leah, Patricia, foreverchanged. I'm surgeries went well and you are all well on your way to recovery. I know I was so relieved to have the surgery behind me!",
