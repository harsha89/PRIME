I was diagnosed in April 2015, stage four right off the bat. I did chemo - taxotere infusions along with a second drug I cannot remember, then surgery, then radiation. Scans we're good (NED), So I started on Exemastane for awhile with some success, and when that failed, ibrance and letrozole, which also worked for a bit. When that failed, I started Xeloda. The Xeloda kept the tumor on my liver from growing, but no shrinkage. I am thankful that I only have the one tumor (mets from the initial breast cancer), but it is a stubborn one that worries me. They tell me that the plan is to shrink it small enough to where they can go in laproscopically and zap it. Fingers crossed that Halaven will do the trick. I still have my hats and a wig from when the initial chemo killed my hair, so I guess I am ready - just in case I am in the 50% of folks who lose it. Is that right, or are there more than that? Any advice for a newbie? I have stocked up on prunes and apples for the constipation - fun little side effect. They said they will inject a anti nausea drug in with my Halaven, which also causes constipation, so double fun. Sorry if this is too much information, but I am stressed a bit. Apprehensive about this new drug and what my side effects are going to be this time. A little depressed too. I am sure you all can relate. Sorry. Any advice would be welcome. Thank you --Liz",

Not looking forward to the fatigue, but one thing at a time, yes? Update:. After a couple of hours, I started feeling much better. Back to normal, in fact. I finished my work and went home. I even picked up some sandwiches on the way home (mine was vegetarian with whole wheat, artichoke, cucumber, red pepper, etc). I tentatively ate two bites and waited. Had a couple of chips and waited. Drink of water - waited. It was all good. Ate half of the sandwich because I did not want to tempt fate. Then, still feeling fine, I remembered that I should eat a couple of prunes for the possible constipation S.E. That was my down fall. Not sure if I just crossed the maximum volume my stomach was willing to put up with, maybe the prunes expanded with the water. Maybe it was just coincidence, and I would have had the pain either way. Or some weird thing involving my liver tumor and the sugar from the prunes + Halaven. I doubt that last one, but who knows. Anyway, right after the prunes, the intense pain kicked in. Stomach, liver area. A little nauseous too, but the pain was incredible. Panting, sweating, hard to talk pain. I tried walking, laying down, sitting - nothing. An hour later and I am a little better. Sweating is better and only a little labored breathing. Tolerable. Live and learn. Next time I will try one fourth a sandwich, more waiting time and one prune. Hey, I could stand to lose some weight, so .... Glass is half full...? Not sure even I believe that, but that is what I am going with. üëçüèº Sorry for the long post, but typing is distracting me from my discomfort. Hang in there ladies, we can do this! ‚ù§Ô∏è ",

The SEs are better already. I spent three hours eating dinner slowly last night, felt a little quesy, but NO HORRIBLE PAIN this time! It might have been the anti nausea med, Aloxi. I got it the first time, but I switched back to ondansatron yesterday, since they both cause constipation anyway ( I was trying Aloxi in an attempt to avoid the constpation - but there are meds to fix that too, and the ondansatron is cheaper -$10 vs $50). Plus I am taking it in pill form, so I have more control over the dosage. The Aloxi was a one time iv dose and lasted three days. Also, Since I had a couple of bad headaches last time, I took a precautionary dose of naproxen before anything had a chance to kick in, so all I am dealing with today is a bit of a stretched feeling. A little weak, but not too bad. I did learn one thing this morning at 2 a.m. I need to get my future infusions in the morning, as early as possible. Yesterday's dose was at 2 p.m. ....the steroid they give you is not indusive to sleeping.

If they tried that now, with the 3 cm tumor, it would be too much for the liver to handle. It might also have something to do with where the tumor is located (segment IV). Mike - I had some stomach pain after my first infusion of Halaven. Turns out the culprit was the anti nausea medicine that they gave me with the infusion (Aloxi). I switched to zofran in pill form, and that seemed to take care of it. Not sure if your wife is suffering from the same, but it's worth a thought. I hope she gets some relief. That pain was terrible.

I know it sounds strange, but it works! I took Claritin the day before my neulasta shot, and then every day for nine days after the shot. Only experienced low level aches. One time, I stopped the Claritin early, after four days. Late on day five I experienced the worst pain in my bones and head. Nothing would touch it until I took half of a oxycotin. Went back on the Claritin from then on. Worked great. That was a couple of years ago. Now I am on a different chemo - no neulasta shot, but my liver is not happy with ibuprofen, naproxen, Tylenol, or most other pain meds. My oncologist recommends tramadol with Claritin. I am just now trying this today (first dose of round two - Gemzar), but I expect that it will be effective. Please give it a try. Bone pain and migraines are the worst. I hopes it helps.",

From my above post, you can see that Gemzar, on the day of injection (second dose), was hard. We will call it day one. Day two was fine, but I mostly laid around all day, puttering around the house. Day three started O.K., I even ran errands with my husband. Maybe it was the exercise, but I plunged back into the body aches and pains and migraine. Again, I took ibuprofen, the tramadol, then naproxen when the headache would not go away. It took a few hours, but it eventually got better. Next time I will try a preemptive strike and take the meds early. I also have this weird spot on my shin that felt like a bruise, then a rash, then a burn. The oncologist did ask me if I developed a rash yet. It faded over the following days, but I will definitely be telling her about it next appointment. It is one of the Gemzar side effects, so.... The good news is, besides a little tiredness, that is the worst of it. I say that now, but I am also wondering about the cumulative effects. Also, I go back this Monday (my off week) for a blood draw to check my liver enzymes. I am hoping it is the Gemzar and not an angry tumor. Thank you Southern, Irish, Lulu, Susan, and everyone else on here for thinking of me. This is a nice place to come for support and advice. I am going to ask about the feasibility of a liver biopsy my next appointment. They have never biopsied my liver, but they did biopsy my breast and lymph nodes in 2015. Then took them out later that year. Hope you all are having a good day. ‚ù§Ô∏è --Liz",

That is good because the anti nausea drug they give me with the Halaven gives me severe constipation. Tried all sorts of natural remedies this week, (prunes, apples) then colase, then a couple other things that I won't mention. I feel like I am already in the \"too much information\" zone. üòä Finally, magnesium citrate did the trick. Omeprazole may keep things \"going\" for my next Halaven dose. Less discomfort too. Prunes and apples are still on the menu, don't want to give up healthy fiber. Has anyone else had this problem. And if so, solutions? Sorry if too detailed, but I am guessing this isn't the first time this treatment has caused such problematic side effects. Let me know though, and I will be happy to be a little less specific in my descriptions. üòäüëçüèº As always, thanks for reading. ‚ù§Ô∏è ",

Only three cycles, with the break in the middle for the appendix. We talked about doing another round briefly, but the oncologist seemed determined to switch to the Gemzar. It might be worth a call back, to get their reasoning behind that decision. If only to reassure myself. Thank you for your input. üòä Update:. I have a call back to my oncologist - hoping to hear back soon. üëçüèº",
