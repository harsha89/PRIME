There are plenty of \"not quite so bad\" outcomes. I hope you can get in soon for your biopsy. Do you take aspirin or any other blood thinners? Stop taking them/check with your MD. They usually want you off of them for 5 days before the biopsy. The last thing you want is to have any testing delayed because of the ASA or fish oil, etc. Once I found out I was in for a number of test, biopsy, lumpectomy, etc, I just stopped taking the 81mg of ASA the doc suggested I take. It worked to my advantage as some of the procedures were moved up due to cancellations.",
