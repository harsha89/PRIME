The amount of info is a bit overwhelming, and sorting thru it to find what might be relevant to me is a big job. I think what the incidental means is sort of like a \"happened to\" type thing, as in they went looking for DCIS in the sample and just happened to find LCIS whilst testing for the DCIS. I imagine the area they would excise would be the calcifications, as that's where the LCIS was found. The problem with LCIS is that it is often multifocal and bilateral, so clear margins are not a consideration. The aim is to see if there is something more sinister lurking within the LCIS, which there is around 20-25% of the time. 1 in 4-5 chance of something nasty - not odds I like at all. I've just been and had an ultrasound and apparently I have very complicated breast (a nightmare, to quote the sonographer [said jokingly, but seriously at the same time]). They are dense and messy. The ultrasound turned up an area in each breast they would recommend core biopsies on. The biopsy I already had was at 2 o'çlock on my right breast, and now there's a lesion at 11 o'çlock on my right breast and one at 3 o'clock on my left breast they want to suck out and look at. My boobs just seem to be the gift that keeps on giving at the moment. Rather than have the extra biopsies right away, I am going for surgical review, which was already in the pipelines anyway. It seems every test I have just totally reinforces my thoughts that a BMX is the best (and maybe only) way forward for me. That's rough with both your mum and you going through that so close together. Mind you, if I do get a cancer dx now, it will be the same sort of thing for my mum and I. She had a mastectomy for IDC about 4 months ago, with clear nodes. Are you both clear now? Do you plan on reconstruction? Do you have to be hypervigilant with your right breast from now on?",

I would much prefer to get rid of the problem in one fell swoop, I really don't know if immediate reconstruction will even be an option for me. I have 2 biopsies booked for Tuesday next week. I got some valium from my GP, which will hopefully help with the wracking anxiety I suffer around these sorts of things. I must admit, at this stage, I'm not feeling optimistic. I just have to get through the next few days without going completely around the bend and go have the biopsies, then more waiting. This sux. Reflect - Thanks. I haven't been offered an MRI yet. Maybe that will be the next step. Having the ultrasound recommended surprised me, and the findings surprised me even more. I got the results today and have several small simple cysts in each breast, as well as a hyperechoic mass in each breast (totally separate from where I've just had for biopsy for calcs that showed up the ALH/LCIS), both of which fill with vocal fremitus (not a good sign at all from what I've read), and with reactive lymph nodes on both sides. The right side mass shows possible vascularity and the left side has a few prominent ducts deep to the nipple. Things are turning out much more complicated than I ever expected, and all so much more frightening. It seems every test I have just turns up something worse. And all of this with nothing unusual felt by the breast doctor or the breast surgeon.",

I was supposed to get results in 2 weeks, so when nothing had come by today, I went and saw my GP to see if the results had been sent to him. The radiographer at the time said that I'd probably get called back because there were some calcifications. Anyway, my doc hadn't heard anything either, so he rang and was told that I should be hearing soon. When I got home, I got a call from the breast screening place. Apparently, the reason it's taken so long for them to get back to me is that a third radiologist was asked to review my pictures, rather than the usual two. This worries me. Why would they need to get a third opinion, when normally there's only two? Another thing that has me worried (which is probably exactly the opposite to what she was trying for), is how terribly reassuring the nurse who called me was. She went to great lengths to explain to me what calcifications were and what they look like, and that most are nothing more than normal changes in the breast and so on and so forth. It just seemed a bit over the top to me, like she's looking at the results and thinking she's got to calm me down as much as possible before the inevitable bomb is dropped. If she'd just said something like \"Look, it's perfectly normal to need a follow up on your first mammogram and is most likely nothing, but we just like to be sure\", I would have been much more reassured than the long and painfully careful explanations and platitudes I got. My stomach has been churning ever since the call, even though I fully expected it.

The LCIS is just the icing on the cake. Everything I've read indicates that LCIS increases the risk of invasive cancer, tho the degree to which it is increases seems to be debated. Also, because of the nature if LCIS, there is no way of knowing if it is anywhere else. The only reason I know I have it at all is because I had that one little area biopsied for suspected DCIS. I am hoping, because I don't actually have cancer yet, that the mastectomy can be tissue sparing with immediate implant reconstruction, which is something that would probably be off the table if I do get cancer in the future. I feel like I have a couple of time bombs sitting on my chest, and I felt that way before I even had the mammogram. The LCIS diagnosis has just strengthened that feeling.",

I did get the report from the GP. The whole finding out about the dx has been a bit of a dog's dinner. I had a sterotactic vacuum assisted core biopsy for microcalcs found on a mammo.

There are 2 breast surgeons here, but only one does reconstructions, so he's the one I've been to see and who I have been referred back to, but that was all before we knew about the LCIS. I've been looking at getting the girls lopped off and rebuilt for a while now due to other risk factors, but once the calcs were found on the mammo, the surgeon refused to even talk about anything until I'd had the core biopsy. I'm expecting (and totally dreading) that he'll now insist on an excisional biopsy. I'd like a bit of an interpretation of the biopsy report before I go and see him, and will definitely be taking the report and the discs with the images with me when I do get an appointment.

This morning I went and got my results, which were apparently all good, no cancer, nothing to worry about. This afternoon the doctor called me to say the lab had just been in touch and a small area of abnormality had been found and it was LCIS. I'd already seen a breast surgeon before the biopsy regarding a preventive double mastectomy and reconstruction due to other risk factors, and he was quite hesitant about it. Hopefully now, he will see things my way and give me the surgery. I found the whole process of a mammogram (my first ever), being called back for a second mammogram, then having to go for a biopsy super stressful. I found the biopsy really traumatic and am not sure I could put myself through that again, and only made it through this one with lots of medication and a friend holding my hand. To me, it is preferable to have the surgery now whilst I am relatively young and healthy, rather than wait until I am older and actually have cancer, which might mean chemo, rads, and much more extensive surgery. This morning when I saw the doctor, I explained everything to her, and she was very sympathetic and understanding, and referred me back to the surgeon with a clear diagnosis from the biopsy, but neither of us held out much hope of me getting what I felt like I needed. The phone call this afternoon ended with us figuratively high-fiving over the phone, because hopefully the surgeon will see the LCIS as a decent reason for me to have the surgery. It seemed very strange to feel good about something which I know probably freaks a lot of people out, bit it means I am closer to what I see as the best way forward for me. Does all this make me sound slightly nuts? Or does it sound reasonable? To feel good about something that would terrify others makes me question my sanity just a little bit. Log in to post a reply",

I don't want to make a decision right now though, because I'm still having testing and don't know what my final diagnosis will be.

It puts a numerical value to what I was already thinking. The logistics of the surgery are something I will need to sort out. I live alone, so will need to find the support I need for those first few super hard weeks. The surgery itself and recovery are definitely something I look forward to, but the peace of mind afterwards will be worth it, I'm sure. Luckily there is a really good surgeon right here in Bunbury, though he is not reputed to have the best bedside manner :/ Being on a pension and going through the public system, I don't have a whole lot of choice, so luckily the only choice is someone I would have chosen anyway. Leaf - Thanks for the info. I will see if I can find out the type of LCIS before I see the surgeon. I'm all up in the air about the estrogen issue. I have been taking it for about 5 years, since I went through surgical menopause. My doctor at the time said I would end up with osteoporosis if I didn't have it. I had a bone scan a couple of months ago and have osteopenia in my right elbow/forearm, so I'm very hesitant to stop taking it. The idea of more intensive monitoring sends shudders up and down my spine. I really don't understand how some women manage to go through years and years of it, but my hat certainly goes off to them. They are much braver and stronger than me. I will go check out the LCIS Forum. MTwoman - I actually spoke to my doctor regarding surgery before I even had my first mammogram, due to researching risk factors after my mother being diagnosed with IDC. Having the mammogram, etc. has only strengthened my thoughts on the matter. Yes, one of the benefits of surgery would be that I would not have to go through what I found a traumatic experience again, but it is far from the only factor I am considering. I have never coped well with procedures done whilst awake, and this was no exception. It's something I hope to never go through again, that is for sure. FarmerLucy - I have the paperwork to send off for genetic counselling, but am wondering if it's worth it. Not having any of the gene mutations would not reassure me much. The technology is in its infancy, so there are probably many other genes they haven't found yet, and the majority of women who get cancer don't have the gene anyway. If I had children I might pass it on to, I probably would feel differently, but I don't, so feel it would be relatively meaningless to me. Also, I'm on a pretty tight budget, so have to spend my dollars wisely. ",

I'm looking at getting the second one out today, though I'm a bit worried about having it out so soon. Initial instructions back in May when surgery was first scheduled were drains out after 30ml or less for 2 days, but has since changed to 50. How can it be so different? It's just weird, and a little disturbing. Are some surgeons over cautious? Or are some surgeons just trying to move their patients on from their care as quickly as possible?",

I will be devastated if cancer is found and I have to go under the knife again to have nodes removed. I just keep telling myself to take a deep breath and not to waste energy on things that haven't happened yet, but it's so hard not to worry and fret about it. I need all my energy at the moment for preparing for the surgery itself. I live alone, so have to everything I can to create a situation where I can do everything I need to do myself.",

Naturally, under the best of circumstances, this would have me a bit worried. Adding it to everything else, tho, it is very worrying, and I'm trying hard not to get too panicky or too far ahead of myself. My mother has just had a mastectomy for invasive BC (I don't know the details, but just that it was caught before it had spread anywhere else, which is great news). Her mother died of breast cancer about 6 years ago and her only sister has also had breast cancer (Risk factor 1). I have never had children, and therefor have never breast fed (Risk factor 2). I have \"young\" dense breast tissue according to the radiographer (Risk factor 3). I was a heavy smoker up until 4 years ago (Risk factor 4). I am on oestradiol valerate because of a radical hysterectomy about 5 years ago (Risk factor 5). I have HPV and have had CIN3 (Risk factor 6). Oh, yeah, and I am a woman with breasts (Risk factor 7). During my last annual blood test, I had really low vitamin D and am not on supplements (Risk factor 8). I feel like the odds are stacked against me and have pretty much decided in my head that I have cancer. Sometimes I don't feel too bad about it and am planning on my best way forward from that. Other times I feel totally panicked and overwhelmed. I know the only thing I can do is get on with life until the worst either does or does not happen, but my head just drives me around the bend sometimes. I have to admit, I am scared. I know a cancer diagnosis is not the death sentence it used to be, but just the thought of it is very frightening :( Blah. There's my vent. Thanks for reading. Log in to post a reply",

My pain has be almost non-existent and I'm down to just taking paracetamol every 4 hours, not because I'm in pain, but because I'd prefer to have something on board, just in case, for the next few days. I've been sleeping well, able to side sleep from the same night as surgery. Today I got the right hand side drain removed, and hopefully the left one will go on Wednesday. My ROM is great and I can do all the exercises the PT gave me with ease. All the concerns I had about being able to look after myself have disappeared.

I've called the hospital and don't have to be there until 11am. Finding out that has calmed me down a lot. I was racing around like an idiot, thinking I'd have to be at the hospital ridiculously early and wouldn't have time to do anything in the morning. I've burned up a whole lot of nervous energy, run around in lots of circles, picked up a lot of things and put them back down again, only to circle back and pick them up again. I've rather unceremoniously dumped all my bras in the bin, except the one I will wear to hospital in the morning. I've tried to plan for every contingency, but doubtlessly have forgotten something. I hope I sleep tonight. It might be my last comfortable night for a while. The breast care nurse called to go over things again with me, since it's so long ago that I had my appointment with her. Apparently now the surgeon has changed his care plan, and I can have my drains out after 2 consecutive days of 50ml or less, rather than 30ml or less. That means drains out earlier ... yay! It's all systems go. All I have to do now is shave my legs, which have a lovely coat of winter growth, then sit down and relax for the rest of the afternoon. Deep breath. I got this.

I really don't know the full reasoning behind it, and I didn't think to ask the nurse who removed my second drain yesterday if there other ladies who'd had them taken them out under the new protocol had reconstruction or not. Happily it's turned out well for me, but from reading other women's experiences, I imagine there'd be at least a few who would have problems with seromas and stuff. I'm really glad I did get mine out so early. The second one hurt like a bastard, cos it had kind of glued itself to my tissue. It would have been a lot worse if it had been left any longer.",

I know from going thru similar stuff with a pap smears that worrying doesn't change a thing, so I am really trying to keep life as normal as possible while I'm waiting to hear the results of my mammogram. Still going to work and the gym and everything, but I get these moments of gut wrenching anxiety which are really horrible. My GP has referred me for genetic counselling, but that could take months on the public health system. Apparently they only do counselling once a week and all the referrals are triaged, so it could be ages. I will certainly have the results of the mammogram before I get an appointment, so the point might end up being moot anyway. Just gotta take a deep breath and carry on in the meantime, I guess. ETA: Just realised what I'd said and it was wrong. The genetic counselling does the triaging once a week, not the counselling, so an appointment might not take all that long. It depends how bad my situation looks to them. Maybe having to wait ages for an appointment would be reassuring somehow, I don't know.",

This, however, has never been brought up with me by my GP or breast surgeon. I have many other risk factors, including heterogenously dense breast, family history and LCIS/ALH, for which I am scheduled to have a PBMX in October. I guess the reason the enhancement hasn't been brought up is because it doesn't affect the decision one way or the other, and will be taken care of with the mastectomy that is already going to be done for other reasons. The MRI was ordered to look at my nodes prior to surgery to see if any showed anything significant which would require them to be biopsied or excised at the time of the mastectomy. Thankfully my nodes looked clear, so they won't be touched. The reading I did about enhancement kind of led me to believe the main reason it was a risk is because it makes it hard to see if there's anything bad lurking there, a bit like the density of breast tissue. I have to admit that I didn't look into it too deeply, though, because it's not going to make any difference to my plan going forward.",
