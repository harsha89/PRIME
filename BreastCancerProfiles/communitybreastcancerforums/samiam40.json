Now that I am healing from my exchange, I actually feel like my MOJO might possibly be returning.  I was never a boob girl, but it is remarkable how much of our self image is tied into having breasts.  The ONLY thing that has changed is that now I feel like I look better, and suddenly I am entertaining the possibility of getting close to dh again.  How strange is that?",

I'm glad you are feeling better.  I see you are about 4 weeks out from surgery, which was about the magic mark for me too.  Here's to getting back to \"normal.\"",

The saying the squeaky wheel gets the grease (or something like that) is really true in the case of medical treatment.  When I was first diagnosed, I was told by my desired ps that they couldn't see me for 3 weeks.  I called every day to ask if they had a cancellation until they either found one or got tired of my calling and fit me in. Have fun at the garage sales.  I hit one at 7:30 this morning.  Good luck!!!",

By Sunday, I really felt better and like I turned the corner as far as pain, so I decided to get off the narcotics.  Am now managing pain with just motrin and valium.  Today I saw my plastic surgeon and she took out 2 drains.  I still have 2 left which she predicts will be out by the end of the week.  She did say that the skin looked a bit raw and blistered in one area because my breast surgeon was so agressive in taking out tissue that it left the remaining skin in a bit of a mess.  She was optimistic that I wouldn't lose the compromised skin since I hadn't already, and suggested I rub A&D ointment into the blister to keep it moist. I got pathology reports back today also.  My breast surgeon (did I mention she was agressive?) took out 10 nodes during my sentinal node biopsy.  2 sets of 3 on the cancer side and 4 on the prophy side.  All came back negative.  There was no sign of cancer on the prophy side. The IDC tumor on the right side was a bit larger than we expected (2.6 cm vs. 1.6), but I'm not sure that really changes my treatment plan much.  I meet with an oncologist in 3 days to discuss. Overall, a decent experience so far.  My upper chest still hurts like he*l, but less like a Hummer is parked there, and more like a Mini-Cooper.  To anyone about to undergo a similar procedure, please know that you can totally handle it, just take it one day at a time.  As with most things in life, I have learned, the waiting and worrying is worse than the actual reality.  Peace, love & healing to all.",

Bitchiness-that's totally understandable.  I felt completely on edge and snappy, but Xanax was my friend and the doctor even OK'd my taking one the morning of the surgery, so that would be recommendation. Good luck to all of you with upcoming surgeries. P.S. I'm not quite 3 weeks out from surgery.  Don't yet feel what I would consider \"great\" but most everything is do-able.  I've been off pain meds since day 4 and now just take motrin and the occasional valium as a muscle relaxant.  All drains are out, I'm driving, back to being Mom and going into work for an hour or so a day.  Still need a nap in the afternoon and spend most of my time off my feet, but you will bounce back before you know it.",

Deen, good luck with your fill and impending exchange and ooph. 2new1s, are you on facebook yet?  I don't know how to post pics here, other than the avatar, but just posted my daughters spring portraits on FB and it was super easy.

Caligrl (or Stacy--that's my real name too), good riddance.  If he's cheating, you don't need that. Jillisu--I've been reading your posts about your husband and am not sure what to think.  As you said, if he's taking care of the kids and the house and is generally (if not entirely) supportive, maybe he just needs time.  A therapist talked to my support group last week and suggested that we spell it out for the husbands (i.e., saying \"I know this is difficult for you too, I need you to be my partner in this, can we talk about it for a few minutes\", etc. etc.) Love all the new pics and hope everyone is healing well. Question to people who have had mx.  Does the skin on your chest up to your collarbone feel thin and rough?  Mine feels almost sandpapery.  And it has the strange sensation of being numb yet hypersensitive at the same time.  Should I try rubbing lotion on it.  Any ideas?  Is this normal?",

So, I guess the moral of my story is the pain sucks really bad for the first 24 hours after surgery and don't expect it not to.  But it gets better after that.",

Alyad, maybe you should think about coming down to St Louis for at least part of your treatment.  I've had procedures at 3 hospitals so far during this journey and have found all the people I've dealt with to be very concerned about avoiding any unnecessary pain.  Plus you don't need to get all your treatment done at the same place.  I'm got my surgery done by one of the best in town (Radford) but I plan to get several opinions from oncologists and may very well end up going somewhere completely different for my chemo/anti-estrogen treatment.  Also, my ps has gummy bears!!!

Also, I wonder why your doctor told you advil after surgery is a no no.  I know it is prohibited before surgery, but afterwards when I got off the narcotics what I switched to was advil, 4 at a time, every 6 hours.  Just be sure to drink lots of water if you take it, because it can affect your kidneys.",

Recovery time does depend on what of surgery you have.  If you do delayed reconstruction, you should heal much faster.  If you have tissue expanders implanted at the time of the mastectomy to preserve and stretch the skin, your recovery will be tougher.  Flap surgeries (diep, tram) are a whole different ballgame with a lot longer recovery time. Whether your mx is prophy or not, you can keep the skin--it's called a skin-sparing mastectomy.  I believe if your mast is prophy, you can keep the nipple.  However, if you have already developed cancer, you definitely cannot because it contains breast tissue. I would not recommend \"waiting until breast cancer develops.\"  You might end up like me, waiting too long, and not being diagnosed until the cancer is invasive.  A diagnosis of DCIS (pre-invasive) is much easier to deal with and considered completely \"curable\" with appropriate treatment.",

Something else to consider, if MRI is not an option due to cost, is getting a biopsy of the lump.  Getting a negative report back from a biopsy could give you more piece of mind.",

Now that the swelling has subsided, I just have giant horizontal scars across the underside of my armpits where the pooches look like they have sort of \"collapsed in on themselves\". I have bought several different front hook sports bras in various sizes, including 3 sizes larger than my usual bra size, but they all seem to cut into and cause pain to the sentinal node biopsy scars. In desperation, I found an old loose tank top to wear to bed tonight to give my armpits a rest, and I literally want to cry it feels so much better.  But I also need to be able to move around during the day and keep the mastectomy scars protected, as they are in pretty bad shape and I have been advised to keep them moist with ointment and covered with gauze to help them heal.   A regular tank top isn't going to hold up the gauze and my skin is too sensitive to put surgical tape all over it. I am so blissed out right now that the horrible bra is off and my node scars are not feeling irritated.  Does anyone have any advise as to alternative things I could wear during the day, or at least clue me in on how long it takes for the pain in the armpit area to reduce and be less sensitive.

My doctor said that because my cancer was invasive, chemo would be offered to me even if my nodes were clear.  I plan to take it.  Everyone has to make the decision based on their own risk tolerance.  Personally, I am willing to live with a few months of hell and the risk of serious side effects to make sure my bc is gone.  Since my tumor came back er+, I will also be offered and will accept tamoxifine.  As far as the implants vs diep/tram flap procedure, here's what I understand in very broad generalities, keeping in mind everyone's situation is different.  Tissue expanders is a fairly routine surgery that takes a few hours vs. flap which is microsurgery and takes the better part of a day.  TE requires you to be in the hospital for a day or two; flap is closer to a week in the hospital.  TE has a couple week recovery period when you are pretty much laid up in bed recovering; flap is six solid weeks of recovery time.  Again, I'm sure people on the board will have different experiences and I would recommend you listen to everyone and make the decision you think is best for you. Please feel free to pm me if you want to talk more.  I am always bumping up against the 5 posts per day rule, and am often unable to reply to people because of that.  Hang in there and keep us posted as to what's going on with you.",

Now that I am about 6 weeks out, I can even take off over the head shirts, albeit very slowly, and reach up to high shelves to get things.  So, know that it does get better, you just have to give it time. I'm wondering why you would need chemo with DCIS.  That would be very unusual.  Did your pathology report find some IDC in there?  Sending you healing vibes, Samiam40",

I do not work for Kohls nor get any financial benefit from this.  It just seemed like a great deal to me.  Plus you can return things to the stores that you bought online.  Just trying to be service-y!  Now, off to check out the breastbinder site and see how much more damage I can do to my credit card accounts at 3:00 a.m.!!",

I have drains in right now 6 days out from my exchange surgery.  My surgeon said she will not do the surgery without them, and I asked the nurse at the surgery center whether all plastic surgeons used drains and she said everyone who operated there did.  It may not be the norm, but quite a bit of fluid has been coming out over the last 6 days, so she must know what she's doing.  I'm so over them, though, and really hope they can come out tomorrow. One side is definitley outputting less- under 15 cc's, one side a little more at approx. 30 cc's. I'm been searching on the internet if this is good progress or not. I'm going in circles! My surgeon's threshold for removing a drain is output totaling 25 ccs or less for the preceding 24 hours. ",
