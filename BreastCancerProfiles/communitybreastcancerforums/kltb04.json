My understanding is that BMX vs lumpectomy/rads don't necessarily increase the chance of survival, but there is slightly more of a chance of recurrance (someone correct me if I am wrong).  Regardless, it is your decision...I am having neoadjuvant chemo on a 3 cm tumor and lumpectomy will likely be an option but it is my personal decision to have a BMX when chemo is done. ",

So 8 rounds around 3 weeks apart works out to about 6 months, then a break I presume, then surgery.  We haven't even discussed rads yet.  I have a port too - it will be your best friend, trust me, especially if you have crappy veins like I do. Hair - Ah wigs - this hair thing has been the bane of my existance - I shaved mine all off as soon as it started coming out.  I am in Arkansas so humidity and heat here too is going to make my wig so uncomfortable.  I bought a good (read $$) monofilament wig that everyone says looks so natural and I cannot stand it most of the time.  I can't do the scarf thing by itself but I can do a scarf, tied at the base of my neck with a cap or hat on top.  I just need to get some cotton scarves.  The ones I have are silky/polyester.  My hats I have so far are just inexpensive cute/blingy things I have picked up at the Dollar General or Walmart.  I have also tried ordering halos (wigs that are topless and for wearing under hats) but sent two back already because of comfort/fit.    Good luck as you get started - I advise everyone just starting out to find a corresponding \"Chemo\" board to post on as well...even if they aren't getting exactly the same treatment as you, it helps having people at similar stages going through it at the same time.   One last thing - Craftylass - how are they measuring your tumor, if you don't mind me asking?  My MO gives me a quick \"feel up\" (lol) before each TX but she hasn't once mentioning shrinkage or evaluating it??? I go on Monday for A/C #4.  I poke around myself a bit but it was kind of hard to find in the first place (mine was more of a shallow/long \"ridge\" rather than a hard round lump).  Just wondering.",

Hang in there..there are going to be a bunch more tests and waiting but you can do it.  And here is some good advice about worst case scenarios that I got from someone on another thread.  \"Don't spend a lot of time imagining the worse case scenario.  It rarely goes down as you imagine it will, and if by some fluke it does, you will have lived it twice.\"  Micheal J.

I thought it had gotten better for a while but it seems worse now. To add to this, I had my put in yesterday so now I am useless. in pain on right side from SNB and left from the port.

      "Content": "kltb04 wrote: Hi all...I have been on the boards for a few weeks but new to this forum.  I had an ongoing thread called Just Diagnosed/Fearing the worst with a few people I talked to but I thought I would post a new thread since I am no longer either of those things!  I also post frequently and with an excess of words, on March 2012 Chemo.  I am a married mother of 2 girls (8 and 11), a certified teacher who hasn't taught in years, was working PT in retail until my dx and now at home full time.  My parents are actually living in an RV in our yard and they have been a great help. My story in a nutshell: My APN discovered a \"ridge\" in my right breast on my annual visit on 2/5.  I am 38, never had a mammo, so a whirlwind ensued...diagnostic mammo, biopsy, meeting with BS and MO, SNB, staging PET scan, CT/Muga, port placement, complications/infection from an infection (culture grew in my blood, no idea of source), re-excision of SNB site, drain inserted.  Yesterday, I got the drain out and started chemo. Which brings me to the other part of my topic.  My BS/MO suggested the neoadjuvant chemo before surgery although my tumor is not particularly large (3 cm according to MRI and mammo, the PET scan seem to show even smaller).  The SNB showed 1/4 nodes involved, but the neo chemo was the treatment plan before those results were even available.  Any others here going that route?  Deal is done now but I was just wondering. As I said, first chemo was yesterday.  A/C x 4 and then I there will be 4 more but I am not sure of the cocktail.  Nuelasta shot today and I am just waiting for that horror to kick in.  A lot of people on my chemo board have bone pain with it.  Main SE right now are just fatigue, total and complete disinterest in food, mild nausea but more of a \"lump in the throat\" feeling that makes me feel like I will be sick if I try to eat.  Currently working on a Boost protein drink and trying to get it all down. Well, that's about it for now...

I don't know what I did before all this. It literally is my life now.",

If so and like others have said you will probably be fine the first couple days. For me the worst days are usually the night of 3 through about 5. This round has been longer because I am in round 4/4. (nothing unmanageable just feeling bleh). My SE are made worse by the nuelasta shot the day after chemo though. Do you know if you'll be getting that? Regardless you may find you can drive yourself to and from the next few but it's always good to have someone with you the first time. My drs office lets someone stay with you if you want. They may have to sit in the floor if the chairs are full but they never ask anyone to leave.",

So much better this week...my WBC was still low (3.6, not bottomed out but still below normal) so I have been lying low this week.  Appetite is back with a vengeance so no worries there.  Had some constipation issues so I started on a stool softener.  But feeling better lets me know that this is definitely doable!",

My girls seem to be fine - we told the oldest the basics right after I got my biopsy results - she was very \"suspicious\" as I usually was the one taking them to and from school, home all the time and she overheard whispered conversations.  We told her breast cancer, very treatable, etc...with my younger one, we just told her a \"boobie problem\" for the first few weeks.  After I got my wig and we told her I would lose my hair from the medicine, we went ahead and used \"the C word\" but again, tried to keep it positive.  So I don't know if they are just putting on an act or if they are really ok, but they seem to be hanging in for now. ",

My dx was the straw that broke the camels back. She was really wild and spastic and was always running all over us to the point I was scared I would be scratched to bits when she went on a tear So we gave her to someone who works at the same company DH works at.
