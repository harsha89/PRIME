I plan to meet with my surgeon next week and start to make the arrangements for the double mastectomy.....I think it will be the only way I can get some sense of peace of mind.  The other factor that is leaning me towards the mastectomy is that I have Rheumatoid arthritis which will only continue to be more of a problem down the road as I continue to age.... I'm 45 and have a rather aggressive form of it that despite being treated for the last 8 years, remains uncontrolled.  Thanks again and best of luck to you! I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers! ",
