During my yearly breast exam, my dr stated that both of my breasts were lumpy and for me to keep on eye on them and call if I was worried so she could order an ultrasound. Well I called on Monday and had them schedule me an appt because I was tired of worrying myself to death. Well I had my first mammogram and left breast ultrasound today. The radiologist asked for additional views and then they performed my ultrasound. When the radiologist came in, he said that it was not a cyst like he was hoping. He said that the lump is not round and does not have well defined borders. There was also some blood flow in and around this lump. To me, the lump feels HUGE when I touch it but the nurse said it was only 1.5cm and according to her, is small. The radiologist also stated that there were calcifications seen on my mammogram. He catergorized it as a Bi-Rad 4 and I am scheduled for a biopsy in a week. I am only 26 and have no family history of breast cancer but I am totally freaking myself out right now. I am a worrier anyway but now that this is hanging over my head, I am so scared. I have been trying to find the difference between a fibroadenoma and breat cancer but cannot find anything. Does a benign tumor have blood flow? And can a fibroadenoma have undefined borders? I need some answers. I am so worried! TabathaÂ ",
