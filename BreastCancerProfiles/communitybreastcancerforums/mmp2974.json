Most likely an infection due to mastitis when I was nursing or a previous injury to the breast. They will be doing a biopsy on April 28 I think. He did say he is fairly confident that it is not cancer.",

      "Content": "mmp2974 wrote: Last Friday I went to the doctor and I wanted to have some changes in my breast looked at. I had what appeared to be an infection of some type. My right breast has an area which is inflamed and sore and what appears to be bruising or blood under the skin. They told me it might be inflamatory breast disease and I go for a mammogram on the 15th and to a surgeon on the 22nd. Why would they send me to a surgeon when I haven't had a mammogram yet? Has anyone had the same? I am 33 years old and I am really scared. I never thought I would be going through this. I know it happens to women of all ages. I did some research on the web and I learned that if it is inflamatory breast cancer it is one of the rarest breast cancers and also one of the deadliest. Anyone out there have experience with this? Any info would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

This whole experience has really opened my eyes to the fact that I just didn't know much about breast health, or really even how to help prevent disease. I am going to share everything I've learned with my women friends and family. Especially about IBC. I was one of these women who always thought you had to have a lump to have breast cancer! NOW I KNOW BETTER.",
