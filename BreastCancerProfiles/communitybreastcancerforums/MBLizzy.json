I went in for my annual mammo and they noted micro classifications, had a biopsy and found ilc in my left breast. At that point it looked small and thought i would need a lumpectomy. I went for an mri and a 3.7 cm tumor was found as well as what look like a 5+ cm tumor. Neither showed on mammo or u/s. the right breast look fine and was told my choice of bmx or uni- but after the mammo missing the tumors, i decided on a bmx. After the BMX, turns out the 5+cm tumor was 4 smaller ilc tumors and my my lymph nodes were negative. Also, the right breast had a small ilc tumor. I will not be needing chemo or rads (Low risk on mammaprint). Will be on tamoxifen for 5 years, starting next week. The ilc was probably growing for several years.",

So glad I did the right side too - a small ilc tumor was also found in my non cancer breast, along with dcis. The prophylactic mx was clearly the right call. Sending out good thought to everyone!",

Now, if I am being more active ( been walking a lot) I feel better with a little compression, at night it is a little uncomfortable, so i don't sleep with a bra. The rest of the time is mixed. I am starting to spend more and more of my non-active non-sleeping time with the target bra. It is light compression not like a traditional jog bra which is still not comfortable for me yet.",

I will be having anatomical Mentor implants which will be a tad larger than the TE. My experience with the TE hasn't been awful but I will be very glad to get rid of them.
