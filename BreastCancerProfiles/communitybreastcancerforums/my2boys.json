Chelev - I agree about the short hairstyle thing.  I always had hair that was a little longer than shoulder length.  When I think that this time last year I was stressing about whether or not to grow my bangs out.....oh boy did I get more than I bargained for.  Two months is still early, so I guess you will have to sit back and wait a bit.  I didn't realize how much my hair was progressing until I saw a picture of myself from April (2 months out) and I was all scalp back then.  I am hoping that my top will thicken up to the point where you cannot see any scalp, but for now I am just happy to be the lady with the short, short hair. Good luck. Anne",

I hope that my experience will help some of you.  Good luck. Anne",

I have been going for acupuncture for my lymphedema for one year and it has improved somewhat. My acupuncturist is using the Sloan study and replicating most of the points except for the one point directly on the LE arm. He does, however, do the points on the shoulder of the LE arm. My swelling has improved slightly and he also seems to be helping with the scar tissue. I noticed an increase in symptoms over the summer when I didn't visit my acupuncturist as much (maybe only 2 or 3 times) and ever since I started up going regularly again, I am showing improvement again. Acupuncture isn't for everyone, but it really helps! The key is finding a good acupuncturist. I have always worn garments and done manual massages every day and I have continued with those as well, so I use acupuncture in addition to regular care, not instead of regular care. One additional note....my knee was bothering me for months and acupuncture helped tremendously with this. Apparently, it reduces swelling. My stress level is greatly improved too!",

I never thought of the chemo as poison, just strong medicine.  If I had never had it, I might not be here today.",
