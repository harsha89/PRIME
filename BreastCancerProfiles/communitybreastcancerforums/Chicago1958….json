And I had (and still have) exactly the same attitude about chemo. I was very fortunate that my oncotype score came back low, but if it hadn't, I'd be going through exactly what you're experiencing, and I feel so much sympathy for you. And for what it's worth, I think you'll probably end up doing the chemo, just based on the struggle you're going through. If chemo wasn't right for you, I think you'd know it right away and be certain of your decision. That's just based on thinking you're like me, and feeling sure that I'd go back and forth but eventually submit to doing everything I could to prevent a recurrence. Best wishes with your decision, whichever way you go, and know that there's a stranger sending good thoughts your way.",
