Good news:  Whatever they've found is under 2cm.  Significance is if breast cancer, it was caught early.  Many of us also were diagnosed via  a routine/annual screening.  Bad news is irregular or angular margins are highly predictive of malignancy. Good news: Although it is initially shocking, frightening, and numbing to be where you are mentally and with limited test information, I can tell you firsthand; that it got way better after knowing- even though in my case it was the dreaded C word.  I'm about 6 weeks out from a mastectomy and I feel great! I'm genuinely happy.  If someone would have told me that about 10 weeks ago, I would have thought they were nuts.  Best of care and hoping for good results for you.   Deborah2012   ",
