I got the sane response from the nurse at my doctor's office. I threatened to show up in the waiting room and sit there until they had a walk in spot for me to see a doctor to get my results. They took me seriously, LOL and I got a call back. That said, the nurse did tell me that if it's urgent (although I did feel my results were exactly that) the doctor would prioritize calling the patient. While not the words I wanted, the doctor not being pressed to call worked out in my favor.",

      "Content": "KillerBunny wrote: I was sent to a biopsy to rule out a cyst vs. a cystic tumor. The original ultrasound was an anechoic mass with irregular borders. Both the tech and the radiologist thought they looked like cysts (it turned out the irregularity, as best as they were able to guess, was that there were 2 cysts together) and told me not to be too worried. Sure, LOL They used the vacuum guided core biopsy and I didn't watch the first but I did second... the dark area was there, I saw the needle getting close, I heard the vacuum noise and then the dark area was gone. Literally just gone. So, with this being what happened, how likely is it that the biopsy will be benign? I'm guessing high, as the lump is no longer there. But, is this normal? But, I'm still worried. I'm comforted that the tech and rafiologist said not to worry... they wouldn't just say that, right? Log in to post a reply",

The radiologist noted that the mass on the films looks different. Which is freaking me out. It was 24 hours and it changed??? And, if it's changing like this, why isn't it at 5 instead of a 4? Anyway, because of this, the radiologist and my doctor both recommend a surgical biopsy. I'm guessing someone here has been through this, what's the recovery like? Log in to post a reply",

Multiple large cysts at 1, 3 and 10o'clock. 12 o'clock position, 1.4 cm irregular contoured anechoic area. There was no abnormal calcifications seen. The breast architecture was not distorted. There was auxiliary lymph nodes with the largest measuring 1.3 cm in size. IMPRESSION: 12 O' Clock position 1.4 CM irregular contoured lesion R/O cyst versus cystic tumor. Suggest biopsy for further evaluation. RECOMMENDATIONS: Surgical biopsy left breast. CONCLUSION: There has been change from the previous mammogram dated 11-9-17. Left breast suspicious looking asymmetry. My understanding is the fact that it changed from one day, literally, to the next is the reason for the recommendation for the surgical biopsy. And, while I know it is surgery, I can't lie, there is a part of me that feels waiting for the biopsy results while knowing it isn't still hanging out in there will almost be easier.",
