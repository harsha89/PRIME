I remember feeling a swollen gland and having a cough not too long after my third and final surgery and was in a panic thinking it had already spread. It does get a bit easier as time goes by and I don't obsess about it like I used to but I think it's something we just learn to live with. Honestly, I sometimes ask myself why I still visit these boards because isn't that just a reminder to think about cancer? But I do because if my thoughts can help one scared person, it makes me feel like something good has come out of this crappy ordeal. Someone questioned why I didn't push for chemo, because I had a grade 3 tumor but a low oncotype score and I had a total meltdown that took long conversations with a nurse navigator to diffuse. I just try to not to worry about tomorrow. Chances are good that you will put this behind you and you'll live a long healthy life. Hugs to you",

I'm sure that would have caused way more anxiety. But as you can see, at one point I had very long hair and that was rough to see the clumps coming out. I never shaved my head and didn't have any scalp problems. Right now my hair is only about 2 inches long and so It won't be as drastic. Today, the chemo nurse told me that Halaven causes the gradual hair loss but she said it is pretty much all of it except maybe something on the sides and back of the head. Patchy. I haven't had a chance to read up what other ladies have written here on this thread, but that's what she told me. So I've decided to buy a new wig with a totally different style than my other 2. Have to try to make this exciting in some way!!!",

Inbetween that 2008 diagnosis, two of my sisters got  ovarian cancer and I had already planned for a hysterectomy to be safe. So in May 08' I had total hysterectomy then in August o8' I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate TRAM reconstruction. It's 7 months now since last surgery and it has been very hard. Recovery for me was very painful ,but in the end I know it was the right choice to have bilateral. I also was ER+ so no estrogens for me. I had a nightmare of hot flashes ontop of pain from mast. But I started clonodine for flashes and \"By Georege\" it's working! Crying every day was a norm for me. But my husband and family were there for me. I hope you have a good circle of people.

I had taken two drugs which targeted 2 out of the 11 mutations I was found to have. I asked him why he thought the study drugs failed to work for me. He explained that basically, no one knows why certain drugs work for some patients and not for others. He said cancer is very complex and at this point, they test for 400 different mutations out of possibly 2,000! Also, different tumor cells may have different mutations and the drugs I took may have had no effect on the mutations which fueled further cancer growth. I told the oncologist that I feel this is a real \"crap shoot\" then! He agreed that science just \"isn't there yet.\" But they are trying! It is just so frustrating as a patient who is moving quickly from one treatment to the next with not much success. I appreciate everything being done, but I'm hoping for something better soon!",

It's so scary in the beginning and I remember feeling totally alone (even though I had tons of support) and like I was on a terrible roller coaster ride but a good friend, who is also a BC survivor, told me something in the beginning that helped me so much. She said \"your job right now is to show up and let your team work for you\". Once you get a final diagnosis and a clear treatment plan, you will feel so much better, I promise. My son was 9 when I was Dx and although he was scared when I told him, he was also a great source of support. Lean on your friends and family and when people ask you what you need, tell them and let them help because they truly want to. This website was a total life saver for me during my journey, especially the \"I'm having surgery this month\" thread. It was so encouraging to talk to ladies who were going through the exact same thing at the exact same time as me. Hang in there and try not to panic, you are not alone. ((Hugs))",

Thinking of the weight loss thing, when I'm under huge stress I don't eat well or at all and I was shocked to learn that between dx in September and when I first met with MO after BMX surgery (about 6 weeks) I'd lost 18 pounds! I certainly wasn't trying to but stress can do weird things. Hang in there and know you're not alone.

I had had a Diagnostic Molecular Pathology done. The tissue used was from 2013. I was found to have 11 known mutations. I took a drug called BYL719 which targeted my PIK3CA mutation, and the drug BGJ398 which targeted the FGFR1 mutation. I was on the highest dose of the 2 drugs the entire 4 months. The protocol for this study was very tough. 13 hour days of testing and then having to go back the very next morning. Some nights, I slept in a hotel next door to my cancer center because I was exhausted. Well, bottom line - they didn't work at all for me. Had progression to my abdominal wall and diaphragm. And I lost a majority of my hair. I think cancer cells can work around these drugs. I don't know - maybe new mutations form? Or my other known mutations allowed the cancer to progress? I will see an oncologist from the study this coming Wednesday and I will ask him. I will post what he says. This seems to be another type of treatment that makes a lot of sense and it does work at times for some patients, but not for others. I have since moved on to Ibrance plus Femara (2 weeks now) after also having limited success in a clinical trial with the androgen receptor drug Xtandi. Keeping my fingers crossed!",

I do still have the same kidney swelling due to tumors pressing on my ureters that I had before Taxol, but so far have no symptoms from this. You said your MO is excited that Taxol will lessen your symptoms. My MO also - she is so thrilled with my last scan result. I will get scanned again in July. But it can take some time for Taxol to work. For me it took about a month until I noticed some lessening of symptoms and that was so difficult! But my MO kept telling me it was the only thing to do - wait and hope Taxol works. I did see two gastroenterologists because I was so desperate for relief, and basically they didn't have a good solution except to keep up with the chemo. Of course, I do worry but for now I'm very grateful for Taxol. I'm hoping and praying so much that it works for you too, Rosevalley, and sooner!!!",

I also wouldn't have had to live with the pendulum of recurrence in the other breast hanging over me. I was diagnosed last spring with a return of the same estrogen + BC, but in my bones.

My onc told me the same thing yesterday about the schedule. I have been on the 3 weeks on, one off for 5 months now, but she is concerned and would like to move me to the 2 weeks on 1 off just as your onc suggested. I asked her to wait until after my next scans which will be a few weeks from now, because I don't want to mess with anything right now! As far as Bunnies - we have many all over. When we had a little Beagle, he would go nuts chasing them and we had all to do to keep him from catching them. He did get a few though and I would get so upset! Now we have a 140 pound huge Rottweler and he is so respectful of the bunnies! As soon as he spots one, he stops short in his tracks and turns completely away from it - gives the bunny space! It's hysterical! Once a little bird flew smack into my glass sliding door in the kitchen and became stunned and looked dead. I saw it happen and I went ooooh, oh no! Well my big Rottweiler thought I was blaming him and he ran upstairs to a corner of my bedroom and put himself in time out! He was very upset. And we never, ever treat him that way - he's my big spoiled baby! We love him. Funny how sensitive this breed which gets a bad rap can be!! Wishing you great success and an easy time on Abraxane!

I will admit that the first night of the surgery I felt pretty awful. Very uncomfortable due to gas pains. Took Gas eX and it really helped. After that, it wasn't at all difficult. A piece of cake after having experienced 13 hour DIEP flap surgery!! Within a week, I was pretty much back to normal. The incisions were very small and nothing to worry about. Good Luck with your surgery. I hope you feel less anxious. I know - it's very tough. Diane",

It took 3 infusions, though, to clear things up and it was hard to wait because of all the severe pain and swelling. But once the Taxol kicked in - relief!!! Yes, you will lose your hair but - some women get hair back while still having treatments. I am one of the lucky ones!! Had 17 infusions so far and my hair is coming in!! I'm on the same schedule - 3 weeks on, 1 off. I'm finding it very doable. Very little neuropathy and yes, fatigue on chemo days. The day after though, I have tons of energy from the steroid which is nice!! Otherwise, no side effects. I'll be hoping and praying that Taxol will work for you too. And be an easy treatment for you.

I discovered that I had dense breast tissue and 2 of those tumors weren't even found until I had the ultrasound, they didn't show up on mammo. I had already decided if one was going, two were going. Like you said, I was petrified of the other side...was it already there and not diagnosed yet? My surgeon said I'd be having MRIs in the future and I just didn't want to worry about it. I plan to reconstruct and thought maybe they would match better. It was the right decision for me but you have to do what's right for you regardless of what anyone else thinks.

My MO ordered the oncotype test for me, in fact he brought it up assuming I knew nothing about it which I did, thanks to this website. He explained that in low risk cancers it has become an invaluable resource in determining course of treatment. My score fell in the low category at 17 so he said chemo would do more harm than good but he did put me on tamoxifen which cut my recurrence rate by half. He also made it clear that a high number would mean chemotherapy which I was comfortable with. My insurance covered the test. Without this information I would have certainly had chemo and now I can feel comfortable without it. It's a giant puzzle and you need all of the pieces you can get. Warm thoughts coming your way!",

I did but it was a tiny pinch followed by pressure. I thought I could handle 50 Ccs at each fill but the first one totally Floored me so we backed it down to 30 Ccs once per week and I did so much better. Don't be afraid to take it slow. It truly wasn't too bad. I took some ibuprofen about a half hour before each fill and sometimes in the evenings following. I also had an Rx for a muscle relaxer and took that a few nights at bed time. Good luck, you're going to do great.",

The CT certainly is able to pick up progression and I think is better at measuring tumors to show if there is a change in size. But I always have a bone scan too, as Amy mentioned, as well as the CT scan. Amy gave a good explanation of pet scan vs ct scan with the pet showing activity.",

There is no good time for this crappy diagnosis but I agree that more aggressive steps are there the younger you are. That being said, my mom is 70 and just finished up with BMX, chemo and rads (and she's doing great). Good luck at your appointment and come back here for support. I just wanted to tell you that my best friend injured her back over a year ago and it is still bothering her. It could be a bulging or bruised disc or a whole lot of things and back injuries can be slow to heal, especially if you're active, so try not to worry about that. Easy to say but try to breathe and stay calm and take it one step at a time. They found it and now it's time to get rid of it! Remember that you are not alone. We have a nine year old and those sweet faces and unconditional love will give you all the strength you need. Quadruplets? Holy smokes and congratulations to you!",
