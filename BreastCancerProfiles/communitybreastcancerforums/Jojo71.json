I know what you mean about disability...I don't have enough credits in the right time frame...meaning I took off more than 10 years from work, so I guess all the work I did in my 20's doesn't count...I would have to work 4 more years with stage 4 cancer to qualify to get disability...whose idea is that???? I have a useless BS in biology...I thought of going for an medical lab tech degree, but decided to go for nursing instead. I'm impressed that you've had to deal with brain mets and are still working... I was on xeloda, and it worked for me for awhile, but 2 of my bone mets fought back  Joellen",

I guess my situation is a little more complicated than I made it sound...to go to school I have to pick up and move to another state. Although that state is where most of my family is and where I grew up, it's still going to be a big change. I will have to find new oncologist, etc. Hardest of all, I will have to move my flock of chickens across the country! I know the change will probably be good...I'm just getting nervous at the thought of uprooting my life and second guessing myself.  Joellen",

I have been a stay at home mom for 12 years, got diagnosed with mbc in 2015, got to remission, and decided to go back to school. I spent most of my adult life sick with anemia, thanks to extremely heavy periods. Now that I am on Zoladex and my periods have stopped, I ironically have more energy than before I had cancer. My onc says it's fine to go to school, but I'm wondering if I'm making a mistake. I don't know how long I will be healthy, and if I only have a short time, do I really want to spend it going to school and working? On the other hand, what if I'm one of the lucky ones, and have 10 years or more ahead of me? And 10 years from now I think, \"man, why didn't I go to nursing school?\" How can I make this decision? I don't have enough information! Is anyone else going to school or starting a new career? Am I crazy?
