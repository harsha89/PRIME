      "Content": "Schmitz8305 wrote: I had breast cancer stage 3a two years ago at age 47. I had a lump. along with rads and chemo. I was told all looked great. I went for my mammogram last week and they took three different try's as they said they thought they saw something. After the third time I had a follow up with my surgeon and she said not to worry about it it was probably scare tissue. I received my report and it said \"dense breast tissue\" probably scar tissue follow up in 6 months. I just feel really uneasy with that, why if I had breast cancer and dense tissue would they not do a different exam? To make matters worse I started spotting after two years of being chemo induced monopause and I have had almost like chronic shoulder/neck/jaw pain causing lack of sleep and headaches for a year. I talked to my onc. and he seems to think nothing of it, I am fine if thats the case but I am so worried that I am going to let all these warning signs go and a year from now really regret it. I hope someone out there has something to ease my mind. Log in to post a reply",
