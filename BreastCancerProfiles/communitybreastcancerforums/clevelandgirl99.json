It's been since May that there has been one issue or another.  All of these tests and procedures for what I am sure will be B9 results.  Not sure it's worth all of the stress and money.

(11 & 13)  My son has a friend over and they are just too loud for what I can handle.  We have a pc and a laptop.  I try to be alone on the computer so I can research this crap but I don't want them to see what I am doing, yet wherever I go, there they are. My S.O. is supposed to come over for a couple hours so we can have a family game night with the kids, but I got angry with him on the phone for no good reason.  Geez, even just trying to type this my 11 year old daughter interrupted me twice.  I need a freaking break. I don't want to think about all of this crap but today was Race for the Cure and everywhere I look I see someone in the t-shirt or wearing pink.  It was even on tv for a couple hours. Having my period in a couple days is not helping my emotional state either.  I just want to get away!!! Can anyone relate? Log in to post a reply",

I would love to just one time go in for a mammogram and they say \"Hey looks good.  See you next year.\"  Instead I am on this seemingly endless 3 month cycle of mri, 3 months later a mammo, 3 months later an mri, 3 months later another mammo. Hopefully the ultrasound just shows a few cysts and the next mri shows no changes in what they have found and then I can finally be done with all of this nonsense. Is anyone else just plain tired of all of the testing? Log in to post a reply",
