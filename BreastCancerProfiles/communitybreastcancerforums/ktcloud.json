      "Content": "ktcloud wrote: I had a left mastectomy a year ago.  I was scheduled for a lumpectomy, but when the surgeon got started, it was obviously not possible.  The same surgeon canceled the pre-surgery consult I had scheduled, saying he was \"just doing a lumpectomy.\"  I was wakened from anesthesia to sign for the 2nd surgery. After surgery, I was told I had stage IIB, Er+, invasive lobular cancer. I found out 5 months later that there was a positive margin on the mastectomy, which neither the surgeon nor the oncologist reported to me. Another doctor mentioned the positive margin in an office visit and I lost it. I opted for radiation, even though it was pretty late in the scheme of things. I got away from that HMO on October 1, when my employer has open enrollment and I could change providers. The new doc has advised me the original report states \"ductal cancer with lobular features,\" and if that is true, I should have had chemo after all, but she says it is too late now.  My new doc is a professor at a big teaching hospital here in Portland. The tumor board is now reviewing all films and slides from the HMO provider.  I will get the new diagnosis on 11/26. Don't let the doctors rush you through.  Ask for a second opinion.  I requested one several times after the original screw-up, but the HMO would never let me see someone outside of their system.  I should have done it anyway and made monthly payments forever.  Life is a moderately good play with a badly written third act.

I was told the median life expectancy is about 6 months if I chose no treatment.  If I did chemo, there is a 50% chance it would buy me 6 more months. A consult said \"years.\" I had a mastectomy in 2006 and aggressive radiation five months later, when I learned I had a positive margin and a single positive node they forgot to tell me about.  I never did any chemo, but tried Arimidex and Tamoxifen for about 3 months each. I am on home hospice now.  Pain and comfort measures only.  I can't imagine being on one treatment or another for the rest of my life.  I am just going to enjoy myself, feeling as well as I can.
