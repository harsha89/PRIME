I felt pretty good after the first two (aside from being out most of Sat and Sun) but the 3rd one kicked me in the behind. I got a cold virus Sunday. Can't believe you can blow your nose that much! So I am fearing the 4th tx but glad AC will be over and hope Taxol or Taxotere (whichever the T stands for) won't have the nausea with it. The Neulasta shots don't bother me much, just a little achy. But usually I am back to the gym on Monday. So keep a good thought for another one in Michigan in treatment.",

Moving around helps the muscle pain immensely. It hurts much more if you just lay or sit. Get up and just walk around the house. Also with the second I started taking Ibuprofen the day of my chemo as a preventive (800 mg prescription) and so far the muscle aches are not as bad. They also said you can take Tylenol along with the Ibuprofen as they work differently. There is no reason to be in pain. Third, I have been taking Glutamine (health food store) 4 to 6 tsp mixed with milk or juice to prevent neuropathy and so far so good. They also said B6 works. My carpal tunnel in my wrist is acting up a bit but they said that is because with Taxol you retain fluid (like PMS) which causes that (and maybe a little weight gain). This is much easier than AC, no fog, no nausea. I might even go to the gym today to walk on the treadmill. Good luck.",

So this chemo is worth it, but because lobular cancer comes in sheets and is throughout the tissue, there is no hope for a lumpectomy. Anyway, I want it all gone so I am having them take all of the nodes too. Going to the plastic surgeon 3/16 to talk about reconstruction but haven't really decided on that yet as I need 33 rounds of radiation.",
