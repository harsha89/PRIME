So if my son called out for me, I didn't hear him and I wasn't comfortable with that. I'm going back to work in 3 weeks.  So between that, exercise and all the running around that I will be doing, I'm hoping that my brain will be tired enough so that I can sleep on my own.

Had a scare last week.  I had a MUGA scan on the 8th of Sept.  Went to see my onc on the 17th.  Was told that I had to stop my Herceptin because something showed up on my heart scan that is unrelated to Herceptin.  I was scheduled to see the cardio doc right away!  I had to stop all physically activity due to my heart not beating properly.  Great!  All of this on the day that my family was due to arrive!  I went into the hospital last Monday and they did an ultrasound of my heart.  Went back to the hospital on Thursday for another EKG.  The cardio doc told me that all is o.k..  Even though that my heart beat is not \"normal\" for some, it is normal for me.  He wants to keep an eye on me though until at least the Herceptin is done and over with.  I will be seeing him now every 3 months as well.  Never ending!  I was so relieved to hear that I was going to be ok and can start back on Herceptin!  So that is where I'm off too this morning.  Going for my infusion of Herceptin.  Back to the hospital again on Thursday for a CT scan.  Hoping that I will have a good report from that test too! I hope everyone is doing ok.  I'll have to catch up on the posts and get back into things.  Hang tough ladies!",

My FIL had to take her to emergency last Tuesday.  The cancer has spread further - there are two more huge tumors in her stomach and we were told that she only has 2-3 weeks to live.  I hate CANCER!  It has taken so much away from us in the last couple of years.  First me, then my MIL and then my DB.  On a good note, my DB is starting back to work today.  We are both set for a CT on the 7th of January.  We can only hope and pray that both of us get good news for the sake of our parents.  And I do have a question.  We are flying to Florida for two weeks in February.  I don't have LE, but should I purchase a sleeve?

Chris - OUCH is right!  I go for mine in January - NOT looking forward to it! Bwbly - Sorry to hear about your problems.  Glad you are healing. Dayla - You have so much hair!  It looks great! Is anyone else still waiting on their brows?  OMG - 4 months PFC and still only a few hairs here and there - I am still drawing them on my face! Some of  you were talking about trouble with your veins.  The time before last that I went into the hospital for the Herceptin, the nurse had a lot of trouble finding my vein even after soaking my hand in hot water.  They poked me 3 times before they finally got one.  I was getting really upset about it.  Anyway, they told me to drink a lot of water before coming in, it would make a huge difference as the water will pop your veins.  So I tried it.  Last week when I went in, I drank a bottle on the way, and a bottle while I waited and it worked like a charm!  No extra poking - just extra trips to the bathroom!!  I will have to update my pic too!  I love the feeling of going outside with no hat or wig!  Makes me feel so free and back to normal!!!   ",

I had to share this with you all.  My son Travis is 13 years old and he has a school project for Fine Arts to do.  It is called the \"Song Project\".  He had to pick four songs and explain how the song connected to him.  He was having a hard time trying to pick out the songs so I brought up some events like the KISS concert he went to this past summer and our trip to Disney a couple of years ago.  He sat and thought for a moment and said \"I have the perfect song\" .  With that he left the room and came back in about a 1/2 later.  He had written as to how this song connected to him and this is what he wrote. \"My mom is a 1 year Breast Cancer Survivor.  She has been through the fight of her life.  If I could take the cancer away from her or take the fear of it coming back from her, I would.  She is my mom, my step-dads wife and she is a daughter.  My mom has always been there for me, even when she was sick from chemo, she was always there.  My mom is now feeling better and is doing some fundraising for breast cancer.  I ask her why she is doing this and she told me with hopes of someday finding a cure.  I hope they find a cure for Breast Cancer.  I love my mom so much. She is my inspiration\" Needless to say, after I read what he wrote, I broke down and cried.  You just never know what your kids are thinking..... This is the song that he chose.  Listen closely to the lyrics.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5JXktq8G40",

So here's an update on me.  Since the last time I posted (I can't remember when that was!), I have been appointed to the Board of Directors with Breast Cancer Action of Nova Scotia(BCANS).  My position on the board is starting a support group.  We had our very first support group meeting last Friday, and it went over really well.  The group that we have formed is not the tradional support group setting, our group is focusing on fun and empowerment.  We have a lot of great ideas to do ie: tobaggoning, hiking, swimming, etc, but we are stuck for a name!  Any ideas that any of you could come up with would be great. I am also part of a project with BCANS is promoting breast health in high schools.  This project is just starting to get off the ground and I'm very excited to be a part of it.  As we all know,  breast health is the last thing teenagers think of at that age, so we are trying to plant a seed to try and make them more aware of thier bodies - particularly their breast, as most seem to think that most breast cancers are from family history - which we now know are not. Also, some of you may or many not know, this past August, my brother was d/xed with gastric lymphoma.  The type of cancer that he has is not receptive to chemo so right now, only radiation was done.  We are hoping that this will shrink the tumor and make it disappear, but we won't know anything until the new year.  It has been a very tough two years for my parents.  As they are in the 70's, and the two children that they have, both were d/xed with cancer.  My brother and I are both due for CT scans on the 7th of January.  I'm calling my onc and telling him that I need my results right away to rid the anxiety of waiting for news for my parents.  They are doing ok, wondering if it is something that they done wrong for both of us to be handed this crappy deck of cards.  But we know that it is something that just happens. I am still struggling with my eyebrows!  I'm going to try what Nadine recommened and see if that helps - thanks! Sorry for such a long post!  I see everyone is doing well (from the last couple of pages that I read).  I hope we all continue to be and stay healthy! I'll be back soon.  I won't wait so long next time before I post. Take care!",

Francine and Nasharyne - I'm praying for you both.  Sending lot of hugs and positive vibes your way.  I hope you both get the results you are looking for and soooo deserve. Pickle - How are you feeling?  Rachel - So sorry to hear about  your blog - hope you start a new one.  Well, things are going ok for me.  Having some ups and having some downs.  My MIL has been d/x with bowel cancer.  Pretty depressing really.  My husband is  having a hard time accepting this as first it was his wife last year and now this  year his mother.  She will be doing chemo - she is due to start on Monday.  It  just seems at times that it never ends. I am still getting Herceptin.  I have 7  left!!  I will be done in July.  I so can't wait for that part to be over.  As I didn't get a port when I was d/x, my veins are getting a little worn out.  The nurses are starting to get a little upset with me for not getting the port.  But with only 7 Herceptin left, I'm surely not going to get one now! On a couple of pages back, someone mentioned about being  ER+ and getting an oomph.  Well, I'm still crusading in getting that done.  No gyno wants too touch me.  I am getting so frustrated by it all.  My chart keeps getting bounced back and forth between my family doc and the cancer center.  My family doc told me to let it go for now, but we will start fighting again in April.  I don't understand why so many oncs can have so many different standard forms of care.  If I was in Toronto, it wouldn't be a problem.  So in the meantime, I am doing the Zoladex shots every 3 months along with Femara. I have a question.  Is everyone getting their bloodwork done at there 3 month appt and getting their CEA's checked?   My onc hasnt ordered any blookwork for me, but I'm just wondering if it is because I'm still taking Herceptin.  Your feedback would be appreciated.  Hope everyone is doing well and I promise to stay more in touch!",

My work has alo been very supportive by donating their recycables to me and holding \"Pink Fridays\" as thier casual day in which all of the employees (7 of them) wear the shirts that announce our team name and the $2 they pay goes toward CBCF.

The beginning of getting a cancer d/x is very scary for everyone.  Once your mom meets with the oncologists, she will feel so much better as a treatment plan will be  in place.  Make sure someone goes with her and the oncologists will be giving out a lot of information and need to have some info written down as it can become very confusing. Get the status on the hormonals and HER2 is very important.  This will determine the type of treatment she will be having.  As the others sisters said, chemo, while  not fun, is doable.  A lot of ladies on this board have young families to care for and still work their full time job!  She will get through it and everyone side effects are different from one person to another. Please keep us posted how your mom is doing.  We are all pulling for her.",

I was d/x January 2009 at the age of 40 with IDC 14/19 nodes positive.  I also have a 13 year old son.  In the very beginning, being d/x with Stage 3 breast cancer was very frrightening.  But I have learned now, that it is not a death sentence.  For your mouth sores, ask your onc about some of what we call \"magic mouthwash\"  It will do the trick on your mouth and throat.  I expereince the same thing as you are right now and it was cleared up in a matter of a couple of days. How am I dealing?  I live for today.  I make plans for tomorrow and I live in the moment.  I don't take things for granted anymore and because of breast cancer, I am healther than I have ever been.  Sounds strange doesn't it??  I now eat a whole lot healthier than before, and I go to the gym five days a week.  It has been proven that excercise do help to lower the reoccurance rate.  So every time I get on that treadmill, and I feel like giving up, I keep thinking that I'm running away from cancer, running away from cancer. Sharon, being d/x with breast cancer and going through treatment is very, very hard.  Your emotions are all over the place and you don't know what to feel from one day to the next.  Just keep thinking, that all of that toxic waste they are putting in you is working and that is why  you are feeling crappy.  Right now, it seems so hard but you will get through this.  Chemo is the hardest part.  Radiation is a breeze compared to chemo. We are here for you Sharon if you need to vent, ask questions or whatever you need.  As I said before, the ladies here are super supportive as we \"get\" what you are going through.  Before you know it, you will be one of the ladies on here offering support and encourgement to the \"Newbies\" that will unfortunatley join this board after you. Hang tough Sharon.  You can do this.  We are here when you need us. Kim",

I live in Nova Scotia so I am also part of the Canadian Health Care system.  I had a mastecomy in January 09 and was sent home the very next day.  I wanted to go home.  Home is the place where you can get more rest, You can't get any rest in the hospital as they are bothering you every couple of hours. She will get all of the support she needs.  You'll see.  You will be impressed. The only complaint I have is I am waiting to see a plastic surgeron and I am almost two years out from d/x.  Called my Plastic Surgeon last week and was told my appointment is in 2013! ",
