Was on the table for about 75 minutes and very sore today.  They got it done though and glad it is over. I held it together until it was over and then when they laid me over, I cried.  Now I have to wait until Tuesday/Wednesday.  One thing I did find out is they said it is a Birad 4 and then an A.  I thought it was a B.   Also, the medicine hurt going in (to numb the breast) but the actual needle to pull the tissue didn't.  Someone told me (not sure this is true), but they said that was a good sign. Any thoughts? Also, anyone think this could be fibrocystic even though it was 2.5 cms and a birad 4, a?  Looking for some hope here. I am praying for something that can be taken care of.  ",

My stomach fell when I read your entry.  This is as far as I know right now, not a tumor.  They said it was Microcalcifications that are in an area that span 2.5 cms.  I am hoping that this isn't cancer (and praying.)  Has anyone has microcalcificatios in the area of 2.5 cms that it was something other than cancer?  Like Fibrocystic?  Did you find this out AFTER a biopsy or before that is what not cancer?  I can barely stand for the phone to ring tomorrow to tell me my results.",
