If they changed you to BIRADS 5 that does mean the radiologist is 95% sure it's some type of malignancy, BUT, it could be DCIS (as mine was -- I had a 5cm mass initially and was also BIRADS 5) or it could still be benign... but you need to understand that even if the biopsy shows carcinoma, chances are you are going to be just fine. Two of my dear friends were diagnosed with IDC at age 37 and 41 several years ago and they are both FINE now (one is a 2.5-year survivor; one is a 10-year survivor)... obviously it's no picnic, but don't think for a second that hearing the \"c\" word is the worst thing that could possibly happen... it's not. Deep breaths... hang in there... waiting for biopsy results is definitely the worst part!!",

I'm not having it done (in spite of my doctor strongly recommending it because of my young age at diagnosis), nor is my sister-in-law even though her mother is a breast cancer survivor. what would you have done differently when your discharge was turning up benign? Is there any different action you would take in retrospect?  The biggest thing I would have done differently would be IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION. And not take hormonal birth control (although I had already stopped that). Research indicates fibrocystic and other benign breast conditions can be reversed with sufficient levels of iodine in the body. In addition to that, I'd give up my fake food addictions (Diet Coke, heat-up dinners, fast food, etc.) and eat \"real food\" (organic when possible) instead of the garbage that's advertised as food.",

The specialist may do an ultrasound as sometimes that picks up things in young women that mammo doesn't. Nipple discharge was one of my symptoms. In my case it was bloody but manifested as a tiny pin drop of blood inside my bra every day.  Also, I believe benign lumps should be treated as though they could develop into cancer. For one thing, a biopsy could miss tiny areas of malignant cells. For another, I believe that fibrocystic changes are often headed toward cancer if steps aren't taken to reverse it -- the most important step being to have your iodine levels tested and start supplementing immediately with iodine. Iodine can clear up fibrocystic changes and lumps and prevent cancerous tumors from developing... may as well be proactive and start taking it rather than just get monitored every year and cross your fingers nothing malignant develops. I second the idea of having genetic testing done. And you may want to (in addition to monitoring via MRI, assuming this turns out to be nothing to worry about) start monitoring with something called themography as well. Thermography used to be routine in checking for breast cancer, but it was discontinued by the medical industry when it was thought to find too many false positives (in actuality, in most cases it was finding cancer several years before a mammogram was able to detect it!). The down side is that it's not covered by insurance, so it will be a $100 to $200 investment, but it's WELL worth it for the peace of mind and it can be eye-opening and alert you to potential problems. For example, I had thermography done a couple of months before my diagnosis. It showed inflamed areas all throughout what was later confirmed to be DCIS. But it also showed my other breast being inflamed and having fibrocystic changes -- but nothing cancerous, according to the doctors who reviewed my thermogram. Sure enough, that breast showed something on MRI which was biopsied and found to be fibrocystic changes -- just as the thermogram indicated. Now that it's 8 months later and I've been taking iodine for 5 months, I want to have another thermogram to see if it's cleared up my fibrocystic breast -- I'm pretty sure it has since my lumps and bumps have gone away.",

The surgery itself is a piece of cake, as others have said. You go in, get some drugs that make you feel relaxed and wonderful, go to sleep and suddenly it's over. Recovery should be fine for you since you're so young. I want to reiterate what others have said, that anticipation is by far the worst part. I was fine until a few days before (I was so busy I didn't have time to get depressed or panicky about it), but then suddenly I had a few panic attacks about it. I woke up one night around 3am and left the bedroom so my husband wouldn't hear my sobbing. But I haven't cried or even been sad about it once since the surgery. I'm focused on healing and moving on to reconstruction. I can't say how I would react if I had woken up without my nipple, but many many many women give that up without any particular emotional distress about it, so I'm sure I'm an oddball about that.",

Thankfully, mine turned out to be DCIS, which is the \"best case scenario\" cancer. Until the biopsy, though, it's not a diagnosis... it's just an opinion.

I know how much that stings. Big hugs to you and I've learned that unfortunately it's probably best to stick with the forum where people know you best and are the least cruel when they disagree. FWIW, I think treatment is such a very personal decision customized to the diagnosis, and (I know this will shock some) I don't buy that medical technology alone OR diet/lifestyle alone is the answer. Actually both have worked for me in very different circumstances. Years ago when I was in a deep depression that lasted 4 or 5 years, all the St. John's Wort in the world didn't make a shred of difference. Effexor is a drug that saved my life.  On the other hand, when my husband and I were trying to conceive between 2005 and 2007, modern medicine didn't do diddly-squat. It was only after I changed my diet (from frozen dinners and fast food, to whole organic produce and the like), started exercising again and getting out into fresh air and sunshine every day, that I was able to conceive. That was within ONE CYCLE... as opposed to two years of modern medicine not being able to help. One thing is clear to me... whether a person chooses chemo and/or radiation and/or surgery and/or medication/hormones, my adamant belief is that diet (eating \"real\" stuff and much less \"fake\"/processed stuff) and lifestyle (exercising nearly every day, sleeping well at night, getting sunshine and fresh air) is absolutely critical if you want to survive and thrive not just 10 years but 30, 40, 50 years post-diagnosis. I have a dear friend around my age who was diagnosed with bc two years ago at age 36. Even throughout chemo, she was always mentioning brownies she was eating, cupcakes she was baking, etc. At first I thought, \"That's nice, she needs to treat herself now and then.\" But now she's been cancer-free for over and year and she's still always mentioning the cheeseburger she's eating, pumpkin bread she's baking, etc. I've tried to gently suggest, \"Hey, why don't you come over for anti-cancer green smoothies\" etc., but it just doesn't \"take.\" It scares me for her that she's counting on \"medicine alone\" to keep cancer at bay, rather than feeding her body with whole foods that will nourish her. But, I know that each person has to choose her own path and no one can dictate to someone else what to do... something I think all of us here, no matter which side we fall, would do well to keep in mind. ",

The suction thing (Brava) starts as soon as I've healed from the mastectomy, probably 6 weeks. I wear the suction thing for at least 1-2 months, for as many hours a day as I can stand it (LOL).

Are you saying they tested nipple discharge? I asked them if they would do it for me, but they said since I definitely do have cancer, it would be an unnecessary test and they'd still have to do a core biopsy. FWIW, when I was freaking out about bloody discharge, I kept reading stats that said 9/10 cases of discharge are benign. (I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones! ) I'm sure you'll be just fine!",

Size, shape and symmetry can always be modified later, but once your nipple is gone... BTW, I may be the only person who feels this way, but I'd rather be completely flat with my own nipples, than have perfectly round grapefruit-sized breasts with fake nipples. Maybe some doctors can do a better job with the faux areola, but all the ones I've seen look a bit off to me... like that one that zeogr posted looks like it was drawn and colored in with Sharpie markers. Of course, our LIVES are more important than something so insignificant in the long run, and if I had to live with Sharpie-drawn nipples, I'd surely do it, but if you have a CHOICE, I would personally do nipple-sparing mx if humanly possible.",

That's just me though (I am only a B cup too but still HATE having my breasts jiggle while I run, so I can only imagine how much a prosthesis would bug me!). I personally have not considered implants (I don't want foreign objects in me, don't want my pecs stretched out, etc.), but I know there are a lot more implant options than there used to be (smaller ones, more realistically-shaped ones, etc.).

Talk about drive-by mastectomy, BUT, I much preferred it that way... I didn't have any complications, only one side was done, no nodes were taken, no reconstruction whatsoever yet, and all went swimmingly well. Best of all - the preliminary biopsy of the cells under the nipple came back BENIGN so (at least for now) I still have my nipple! HOORAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!

Everything healed up beautifully... I stll have a scab on part of the nipple that I'm ready to fall off, but other than that, no more scabbing, and the scar doesn't look too horrible from what I can tell (though it's in the shriveled sunken skin so it's hard to tell). I got my one and only drain taken out at 6 days; got the all-clear to exercise with no restrictions at 2 weeks, so I've been exercising almost daily except Sundays. I have another check-in with my surgeon next Thursday and plan to ask him 1) when I can move forward with Brava/reconstruction, and 2) when I can move forward with trying for a baby (not necessarily in that order, either!!). BTW, even though I haven't had any reconstruction yet, I never bothered getting a prosthesis... my surgeon left (at my request) a little of the healthy side of the mx boob, and he ended up leaving a lot more than I thought he would... so I still have a \"half-mound\" I guess you could say. In my regular bra and most clothes, you don't really notice (unless someone were to poke their finger into the concave part, and most people don't go around doing that! LOL). I had been a little lopsided before the mx, so if I'm wearing a clingy sweater or something, I put in this cleavage-boosting pad I apparently bought a long time ago.

Fat grafting has been around for a long time, but what's relatively new (within the last 5 years) is fat grafting to create an entire breast (that's where the Brava comes in). The down side is that very few doctors are doing it yet. You probably found the the website of Dr. Khouri in Miami... he's been training plastic surgeons throughout the country on this technique, including at least one or two in NYC. So, it might be a situation where you end up doing the mx now with a plan to do delayed reconstruction... micro fat grafting can be done any time after the mx, even years later. And, even if you weren't a candidate for flap, the good thing about fat grafting is that several different sites can easily be harvested for fat... just a little from here and there would likely be enough!",

By the time I had my first pregnancy, I was 35, and that was the beginning of several miscarriages... wish I could turn back time and start trying at 30 or 31. I'm with you re: the natural route, including for baby-making... the only reason I'm going to try Femara is because of my history of miscarriages, and the fact that I'm 39. Femara could cause me to ovulate more than one egg, which boosts the chances of having a healthy baby (or even having twins, which would be great). Other than that, the best fertility \"drug\" is a good healthy lifestyle... plenty of organic whole foods (especially leafy greens), getting good sleep, doing some kind of exercise several days a week, etc. (It's really pretty much the same list of healthy things to help prevent a BC recurrence!)",

I was glad to hear him say that because I've been a little freaked out by how \"dead\" my nipple seems right now. He also gave me the all-clear to start exercising again, which I'm thrilled about. After several years of being a slug, I had finally started exercising again and got addicted to it... so it was glorious to be able to come home and do Stairmaster and a short work-out Wii game for the first time in two weeks. All of you talking about the tightness that feels like when your milk came in after you had babies is making me sad. I'm thankful that, if dh and I should be blessed to finally be able to have a baby, I still have one breast I can hopefully nurse from, but the idea of having \"just one\" when/if I have a baby makes me feel a little sad. My mx breast is extremely deformed-looking, but I'm dealing with it. Just eager to get on with reconstruction. Boy, will I be a great case study for my plastic surgeon... my \"before\" photo right now looks like something out of an alien horror movie. Jacqueline and Paula, BEST WISHES to you and I'm excited that you're finally getting to join us on the other side soon!!!",

I would be unlikely to do it either unless it were literally an immediate life-or-death situation. I hope you are able to make a decision that gives you the most peace and happiness.   Tomorrow I go for my post-op appointment with my surgeon and am hoping to have my drain removed. My output is pretty miniscule now (4-5ml every 12 hours) but the nurse on the phone made it sound like they won't take it out this early no matter what. Really, really hope he'll remove it since I don't want this thing hanging around (literally) through Christmas.  Five days post-mx, I'm still feeling pretty okay, but the few times I do have a lot of pain, the hydrocodone/APAP prescribed doesn't do much of anything for the pain, just puts me in a woozy, happier, \"warm\" mood (if that makes any sense). I guess it makes me more tolerant of the pain! Is that normal though, or should I ask about switching to a different pain med? Girls, I haven't wanted to mention this but it's bugging me so much. When I finally took a peek under the wrap a couple of days ago, after my initial shock, everything looked pretty much as could be expected... except for one thing. I have a bizarre crescent-shaped \"crater\"... not sure what else to call it... but it's a deep indentation that seems to go right into the muscle. I know my surgeon removed the fascia... is it possible he accidentally severed the muscle itself (he wasn't supposed to) and that this is a big split in the muscle? Of course I will ask him tomorrow, but I'm obsessing about it and really upset, because it goes higher than my breast used to be, and if the plastic surgeon can't do anything about it, I will not be able to wear scoop-neck t-shirts and the like. (I never wear cleavage-revealing outfits, but this goes way up beyond that!) Has anyone heard of anything like this? ",

And instead of Tamoxifen (especially with only an ADH diagnosis so far), I would take 50mg of iodine to reverse the ADH and any fibrocystic disease. Reading some of these message boards (forgive me if this sounds niaive or harsh), I wonder why so many women don't have this done from the get-go? I don't understand why you wouldn't rid your body of something that would, even potentially, end your life earlier than usual.  Many women do feel that way, that their breasts are ticking time bombs and want them taken off ASAP so they don't have to worry. I personally am in the minority... I chose to change my diet and lifestyle to reverse my fibrocystic disease in my \"good\" breast (which three months of iodine accomplished) and prevent a recurrence naturally.  But, it sounds like your mind is made up, and as long as you're 100% comfortable with your decision, that's what matters. As for your reconstruction question, if I end up having a mastectomy (I'm still in the process of deciding), I will do a nipple-sparing mastectomy with micro-fat-grafting reconstruction with Dr. Khouri in Miami, Fl. None of the other options seemed appealing to me because of the sensation loss and having a foreign object in my body which will have to be replaced every 10-15 years (I'm young, and that would be a LOT of surgeries throughout the rest of my life), plus all the scarring (not just on my breast but wherever on my body they took the extra tissue from). The down side is that this type of reconstruction is it's so new that no one is doing it in my city (Atlanta) yet, so it will mean having to fly to Florida a couple of times.",

This is pending confirmation from the scheduler that my plastic surgeon can do it that date (otherwise it will be on Dec. 15). I was originally supposed to have my mastectomy yesterday but they cancelled me without bothering to let me know until Friday... ugh! Oh well, at least now I get to hang out with you ladies as we anticipate our surgeries together! I'm having a unilateral skin/nipple-sparing mastectomy with Brava + fat graft reconstruction. I'm hoping my plastic surgeon will be able to do an initial fat graft so that I don't wake up completely flat... we shall see!",

It's called fat graft reconstruction with the Brava system. Basically, it uses a devide to create a structure in your mx breast into which fat (liposuctioned from elsewhere on your body) is injected. An entire breast can now be created this way. Best of all, it CAN be done on radiated skin in many cases, and can actually improve the radiated skin. Also, there are no more incisions, no implants, no cutting muscle, etc. It's not something you have to decide on right away - in fact, if you wait a year or two, chances are better that plastic surgeons in NJ will be doing it (right now, there are a couple of plastic surgeons in NYC who do it but not many). Just a thought that might take away some of the pressure to decide re: recon. December girls, I will do a proper check-in soon... just seeing the thread gives me a pang of nervousness which is why I haven't been around much!!",

I haven't had to take pain medicine since about 5am this morning (I woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep; was having some pain at the incision site -- one Lortab (sp?) did the trick)... feeling pretty good today and went shopping with my husband and parents. I look like crap (no make-up, walking in a very guarded way, etc.) but I felt pretty darn good for having been in surgery 24 hours before!  One thing I'm still confused about: How do you hit the balance of proper blood clotting (so that you heal properly), without raising your risk of blood clots elsewhere in your body? Also, should I be gently walking quite a bit, or is that going to only make my drains fill up more quickly and be more detrimental than beneficial? I didn't even try to take a shower this morning because I'm scared to peek under the wrap!! (I can tell how flat it is, but I can't tell how saggy the skin is yet... that's the part that freaks me out....) ",

YAHOO on the drain output... hopefully they'll come out soon -- and great news about the nodes, too! Big hugs to you and continued great healing! fire-dancer, I'm so glad you followed your instinct... *whew* that that's all out of you now!! Pasting this part from the NSM thread: I had my post-op with my surgeon today (6 days after NSM). I got my drain out (yahoo!). He took off the bandages for the first time and told me I'm having some skin die-off. He said hopefully it will scab over and later reveal healthy skin underneath. I'm wanting to do some walking or something to improve my circulation (whatever I can to boost the odds that healthy skin and hopefully my entire nipple will survive). Surgeon said wait until after Monday (when he sees me again) -- but I don't want to wait that long. How long did you all wait until you did some walking outdoors? The good news is, the final pathology is in and confirmed the cells under the nipple were benign (not even ADH!), AND, best of all, my closest margin is 1.3cm!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had been worried they would recommend radiation because after my last re-excision, the deep margin was less than 1mm, and I had DCIS beyond the anterior margin. Of course, with such wide margins this time, my surgeon didn't even mention rads. Yahoo!! As I was reading the path report on the way home, it said that grade 3 DCIS was found... previously, it had only been grades 1 and 2... so wow, I'm definitely glad I got that out of me before I try to get pregnant! I forgot to ask the surgeon if it's okay to start eating foods and taking supplements that boost circulation (garlic, cayenne pepper, niacin, etc.). I'll ask on the alternative board but does anyone know? ",

(Of course, I'm sure there are happy-go-lucky, completely stress-free people who still got bc -- but obviously they had other risk factors that caused it in their case.) I read somewhere that bc is often diagnosed 12 to 18 months after a major emotional trauma (yes, I realize this flies in the face of what we're all told about cancer growing for 10 years or more before it's detected). In my case, my massive lump of DCIS appeared about a year after the most horrible tragedy of my life. (I spent the next year not only in deep depression, but stressed out because that depression led to losing a good friend because my abandonment of her ruined her and her family's lives, etc.). ",
