Regarding the soreness from the core biopsy, are you wearing a stretchy, comfortable bra that holds things in place, including when you sleep? Some women wear sports bras for this. I have a few genie bras, popped the supports out of them, and they have been perfect for keeping me comfortable, also elastic enough to keep the little ice packs the hospital sent home in place. Don't know why, but I was way more swollen and bruised after the CNB than after the subsequent surgery. Did the nurse suggest any over-the-counter pain meds for you? Hope your pain will be subsiding soon.",

That surgical biopsy results always take longer than CNB results. That if I hadn't heard anything by the day after New Years (!), to give her a call, as am I booked for an appointment with my surgeon on the first Monday in January, and if no results, no point in the appointment. I told her, maybe someone should have told me the day of the surgery what kind of wait time to expect. I don't have words for how I feel right now. I was supposed to be moving from part-time to full-time work this month. Now everything is on hold. wrenn, if you read this, do things move faster in BC? I'm trying to figure out if maybe my province has a shortage of pathologists, and that's why the wait. My sister-in-law is a nurse in the health district where I had both biopsies. I'm going to call her tonight to get her perspective on this.",

I thought my doctor would let me go back to work today, but she said absolutely not, no heavy lifting (which is a big part of my job) until two weeks after surgery. Don't want to pop a suture! But I feel a little stir crazy, staying at home. Could have used the distraction of work. Today is my birthday, and I don't know what to tell my sibs when they call. Only one sister and one brother know I had the first biopsy, none of them knows about the second. I didn't see any point in sharing until I had something concrete, I hate having people worry for nothing. Thanks for the well-wishes, Beatmon.",

      "Content": "Puffs_Mom wrote: Hello, a first-time poster here, although I've been reading these forums for about a month now. This is my story. I had an excisional biopsy a week ago, after a core needle biopsy showed atypical ductal hyperplasia in one of two suspicious clusters of microcalcifications. I have been getting mammograms for the past four years, and from the reports it looks like the radiologists have been keeping an eye on the calcs from the start, but they only showed as suspicious (two clusters of pleomorphic calcs, along with other diffuse calcs, BIRADS 4b) this September. There have been many surprises these last two months, some unpleasant and some good-ish. My doctor gave me the standard \"Only 1 in 5 suspicious whatevers actually turn out to be cancer,\" and I honestly didn't feel worried until after the CNB, then I was in results waiting hell until my doctor phoned a week later. \"No cancer apparent, but there are some abnormal cells.\" I was so relieved to hear the first phrase, I didn't absorb the second until after hanging up. So I called right back and made an appointment to review the pathology report with her. The 9 o'clock cluster of calcs showed ADH, the 7 o'clock cluster showed columnar cell hyperplasia and a PASH. Her conclusion was that I would probably need close monitoring because of the ADH, nothing more. I was shocked when she called two days later, \"The surgeon wants to do an excision. Do you want it done locally or in the city (where I had the CNB done)?\" Not knowing what the surgery would involve, I requested a local surgeon, and had even done some leg work finding out what kind of wait time would be involved (about six weeks). So I was shocked again to get a call from the surgeon's office, \"We can fit you in in two weeks, you need to come to the city because you need a wire localization done as well.\" I still don't know whether it was a good sign that I wouldn't have to wait, or a bad sign that they wanted to do this pronto. I talked to the surgeon a few days before the surgery, and asked of course whether he was removing both clusters or just the one with the ADH. He said just the 9 o'clock one, which would require a two inch incision. (I should add that the CNB pathology report described the calcs as fine powder-like--I think that is the same as amorphous?--while the mammogram report described them as pleomorphic. If I am understanding correctly, amorphous calcs are less likely to indicate DCIS, at least I am hoping this is the case.) When I go in for the wire localization, the radiologist tells me \"we will be inserting two, maybe three wires to bracket the area being excised.\" I ask how big of an area are we talking about, and she makes a circle about the diameter of a baseball. What, the surgeon said only a two inch incision! But, we are removing both clusters, says the radiologist. No, just the one, I tell her. I get sent back to the waiting room while the radiologist contacts the surgeon, and I end up getting just the one wire, as the surgeon requested. The radiologist tells me that it was decided at the case conference, which my surgeon missed because of a scheduling conflict, to remove both clusters. I don't think I would have been opposed to that, but I was mentally prepared for \"one cluster, two inch incision\" (the amount removed was about the size of a golf ball). It freaked me out, luckily briefly, to have the game plan changed in the middle like that. But for these surprises, I have received the best of care, tolerated all of the procedures well, and am grateful to all the professionals involved. I recognize that medicine is an art as well as a science, and there are no guarantees of anything. On the other hand, this last month has been so scary, it doesn't help to have things come out of left field like that! I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, more for my employer's comfort of mind than my own (I work part-time, so have been off for the last six days, and am supposed to resume work Thursday). I hope my doctor will have the results by tomorrow. I am bracing for DCIS stage 0, or stage 1 at the worst. If it is more than that, well, one more unexpected surprise, I guess. Just wanted to let others who are at the waiting stage know, I'm thinking of you all every day, even though I don't know you. And thank you for this forum, for the info I've found here, reading the experiences of others, and having a place to tell my story. It has been tremendously helpful. Log in to post a reply",
