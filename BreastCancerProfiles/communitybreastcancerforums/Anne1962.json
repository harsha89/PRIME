When I first found out that I would need a biopsy for microcalcs I had trouble sleeping and eating, too. My results came back as atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). Although ALH is a B9 finding it does put me at a higher risk for BC. I hope you get your results soon and that they are B9.  Wishing you luck, Anne1962",

All kinds of testing was done to see why it happened at such a young age, but nothing showed up out of the ordinary. I also have osteoperosis and was put on HRT for many years to help with the menopause symptoms as well as bone density. After being diagnosed with ALH, I took myself off the HRT. HRT kind of messes a person up. I did not like being on it, but was told to stick with it. I don't believe the benefits outweighed the risks in my case and that is why I quit taking it. Who knows what will happen to me after being on it for so long. I am in the wait and see what happens next mode for now. Anne",

I can only hope that if there is anything hiding in there that it will show up on my next mammo. Thank you for letting others know that even if the risk is low, it can still happen.  Anne",

Currently, I'm not really doing anything. My BS said I was high risk, but now she says I'm not. My husband and sisters are urging me to get a second opinion. I am going to push for an MRI (I have very dense breasts) in a few months. My BS is not a fan of MRI; too many false positives. I didn't even have an excisional biopsy, although the radiologist suggested one. Keep me posted. There aren't a lot of us on here with ALH, but hopefully they will be along soon.
