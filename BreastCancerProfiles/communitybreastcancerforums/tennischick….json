My tumor could not be seen on multiple mammograms (even a 3D one) and was initially missed on an ultrasound. When the tech was finally able to \"see\" it on the ultrasound, after much guidance from me, the radiologist came in and assured me that it was probably nothing. My gynecologist sent me for a biopsy and it was cancer. I had very dense breast tissue which made screening difficult. I had an MRI (after my diagnosis) since they wanted to take a closer look at both breasts, and the MRI confirmed the tumor. I am told some doctors are not quick to write a script for MRIs because they are expensive and insurance companies don't always make it easy to get approval. If you are able to see a breast surgeon, it might be easier to get the prescription and insurance approval. Good luck with everything.  ",

I did the exercises in this video before I went to see a certified lymphedema specialist referred by my breast surgeon. I had cording in one armpit and did 8 sessions of PT. My therapist gave me at least 8 different types of stretches. Although the cord is still visible, I have almost full range of motion. My therapist stressed the importance of doing my stretches everyday. https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-educatio...",

I have come to learn that this decision has much to do with what you are comfortable with. I know someone who had a score of 23. One oncologist said to do chemo so she went for a second opinion at Memorial Sloan Kettering. After her consultation with the second oncologist, she was comfortable with not doing chemotherapy. My OB/GYN Had breast cancer and her Score was a 19. She Went to a couple of different places for opinions. She was told she did not need chemotherapy From Sloan-Kettering. But she ended up using a different oncologist Who understood her fear of not getting chemotherapy and said that It was up to her to decide what she can live with. My OB/GYN said that her score was 88% which is a B+ and she could not live with that. She wanted to get an A. She opted for chemo.",

Lymph nodes were clear. I was told ahead of time by my breast surgeon that if I was at stage 2, I for sure would need chemotherapy. But I wonder what my medical oncologist would say. My score came back as a 12. My appt with my MO is on 11/7 so I am going to ask her.",
