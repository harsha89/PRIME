If it comes back positive, he wants my ovaries out pronto.  Yay. (And my four daughters will have to be tested-all of them are over 20.)  Got my official Path. report yesterday, and the Onc's office had accidentally given me two pages of someone else's Dr.'s surgical report.....I really didn't realize that it had nothing to do with my info, until I got to her age, and realized she was half as old as I am, with a terrible prognosis.....I was so upset for her I cried all afternoon.  ( I shredded the info)  Feeling pretty bummed out right now. And I have no reason to feel like this, all things considered!   So happy for you ladies that are nearing the end of your Chemo tx- that is wonderful news! I think I have caught the cyberbug too.  Feel very tired and run down.  Def. not getting enough sleep-right now I have a few disolvable sutures that haven't disolved, and have worked their way to the surface, or just under it, on my abdominal incision.  Every time I change positions at night, the d**n things wake me up! So glad I have a place I can be where other women know how I feel.....love you all!  XO Namaste and God Bless - Jackie",

I can only imagine how hard this is to be dealing with right now- but I echo the suggestion presented that this may be a good move for your daughter right now. Being home with you and DH could really be grounding for her, and knowing that she can help you, may help her. You are BOTH in my thoughts. (What's really weird is that even though I have not personally met any of you wonderful women, I find myself thinking about you all at times during my day. Guess that means that you don't have to know someone in \"person\" to feel friendship and a common bond.) Websister, so sorry to hear about you poor mom. I care for my now 96 year old mother full-time, and falls are terrifyingly familiar to me. I will be keeping you and her in my thoughts as well. Thank you for the info on Benny.....I feel her original post brought me here, so I often wonder about her, and how she is. Sorry to hear things have not been good for her. I hope she finds her way back here-I gather strength from all of you, DAILY. Edi-I look forward to your humorous post EVERY day.....love them! I think you need to send cakes over to this side of the Pond.....you are a doll! If I ever get to England, I am tracking you down.....you will open your door and see this really strange Yankee on your front step.....what will you do????? :-) Traii and Dakota-love you young ladies with your kidlets.....I have so much respect for your bravery and your positivity. You are great examples for your kids, for sure! Liefie, you are an inspiration to me to get my butt into gear and keep physically active and engaged. Thank you (Nihahi , that is true for you, as well!). Loved your description of DH and nursery shopping....I feel the same way about it as you do..... :-) Scottiee, Carlads , Luvmy, and all....you also inspire me with your attitudes and examples. Didn't mean to get so \"emotional\", but since my life has taken this turn, I am speaking out more about how I feel. Thank you all, for your examples, encouragement, attitudes, courage......you are all truly awesome. (((Hugs))) Namaste & God Bless- Jackie",

It sounds as though all had wonderful weekends(even the cockroach cooperated-but not saying goodby to the kids...what an arse!) I cooked for my DH, my 96 year old Mother Edith, my DD and her DH and 5 children.  I didn't get to cook a St. Paddy's Day Corned Beef and Cabbage, so since I was doing the cooking, I got to choose the menu.......I had to explain to the GKs that corned beef is a \"little\" like ham (lol) and that the Easter Bunny likes cabbage and carrots.....  In the end, they loved it, and I made a peach cobbler for dessert.  Defo. not typical Easter fare, but everyone loved it, so I guess that's okay. It is the first time I have really cooked for a larger group since surgery, and I was exhausted afterwards Nihahi, did you get some decent sleep last night?  When my DH starts \"road drilling\", as Edi describes it, I just very undelicately kick him super hard and fast.....he wakes with a start, but by then I am safely pretending to be sound asleep with my back to him.....he sits up and looks at me sleeping so soundly, and then turns on his side and goes back to sleep....works like a charm every time!        Wow!  your SX date is fast approaching.....excited for you to be on the other side. as far as kid-debris goes, I am like Edi and Liefie....I just have to shut the door when the kids are in one of their \"living at home\" stages, otherwise I would have to be committed..... Edi, love your sweet family-those GDs are so cute!  I have 5 GKs...only one GD.  Makes me sad!  She is always wanting to come over for a sleepover.....I havent been able to have her since early January b/c of my surgery.....I am finally starting to feel like 60% of myself, and on  Easter I promised her a sleepover date sometime in the next few weeks. I wanted her this coming weekend, but she is in ballet, and is taking the Royal Academy of Dance exam for level 2 on Saturday, so she said she would have to take a \"rain check\" - her words not mine.  ( I thought I was going to burst an incision stitch or two with that one, I was trying so hard not to laugh out loud.....) Kids are so funny. Traii, I would imagine that you would be beautiful no matter the length of your hair-your avatar photo is lovely.  You are so lucky to have such a supportive family surrounding you-with all you do-work, take care of a little person ( your DS), cancer treatments.....and you are so upbeat!  you are amazing-hope you really enjoy your time away from the \"everyday\" on Philip Island.  You promised Penguin pics.......    Dakota, it does sound as though your weekend went well.....isn't it nice to know that cockroach's family support you?  They know what an Arse he is!  You amaze me as well-with everything on your plate, you remain positive, and you are totally involved in your children's lives-that's very impressive to me.  I love your sweet smile on your avatar- a beautiful person inside and out! Websister-so glad your DIL won!  She deserved to!  I voted as often as it would let me.....I'll bet she is thrilled to have won!  Now I (sort of) know someone who has won something!  How is Mom?   was she able to enjoy Easter with you yesterday?  I am going to wish you an early \"Happy Birthday\" too.....in fact, why not just start celebrating a day early?  You surely deserve to!  Anyway, I hope you have a wonderful day! Liefie, I'm glad your Organ playing was a success- as you said, 20 years....but honestly, I could play for 20 years, and it would still be the same old refrain.....frozen fingers!  Anyone that can play organ is impressive in my book! You are getting all techno on us.....you and Edi skyping!  lol    If you ever get down here to Portland, I'll meet you (in person)!  I am going to just show up on Edi's doorstep one morning....scare the he** out of her....  Bearcub-nice to hear from you! I just live to the south of you a few hundred miles or so..... I hope you have a wonderful trip to the Magic Kingdom with your daughter and her kids....sounds like so much fun!  I would love a break from this cancer stuff.....but I am due for more surgery sometime in the next few months....kind of puts a damper on the planning....  Tell me, are you a black, or a brown bear cub?  I am partial to Brown (Grizzly) bear cubs myself....... Laurie-welcome to the very best group on the boards!  These ladies are the best! I too, had \"just\" DCIS, but as you can see by my signature, I had both breasts removed....the post-surgical path. report said I also had DCIS in the \"clean\" breast.....breast cancer is a b***h.....no matter what stage you have, it's still cancer.  I have had some down days, and these wonderful warrior sisters have been there to pick me up and put me back on my feet! I would be lost without their support...... All the rest of you wonderful ladies-take care, and have a great day! Last, but not least, a Happy Birthday shout out to Benny, whose post started all of this, and whom I have yet to be on the board with at the \"same\" time......I hope you are doing well, and that your treatments are going smoothly....I really do wonder about you, and would be so happy if you popped in to tell your good friends here that you are doing okay......any woman who can handle a horse had my vote! Tomorrow I am going to the airport to pick up my DD who lives in Japan.....she is home for a 3 week (only) visit.....will be nice to see her, but I will find the time to check in with you all.....you're my \"breastfriends\"!

All of this was in preparation for the running around I have been subjected to by my DD from Japan......as she will be working in DH's office for the rest of her time here, she thought we should spend the day together shopping for all the things she can't (or won't ) find in Sapporo.

I will be here, in Oregon, icing my aching feet! Caitlin and Carla-I hope you are both doing okay.....thinking of you! You are both such positive women-great examples for me.

Liefie - love love love hummus! How far are you from Portland??? I can be there in......8 hours?!? My goodness, you are one ambitious lady!

I have to be able to stay up with you on a hike.....I have a feeling that you are a force to be reckoned with on the trail! Don't be mad at me, but I think your DH made the right call re: DD and her \"junk\".....YOU do not need additional stress right now, so close to surgery-take it from someone who's been there. This way, your DD can move at her own speed, and you can focus on YOU. I am sending (((hugs))) your way-cant believe time is moving so swiftly...seems just yesterday we \"met\" on the DIEP board. Excited for you to join us on the \"other side\". Love to all.....believe it or not, after a short visit to the DIEP thread, I am headed back to bed......morning (and the gym) come early here!

Heaven knows I could use therapy for it NOW! Nihahi-the countdown has begun!  Getting excited for you to join us DIEP ladies on the \"dark side\" lol. Have you located body bubblewrap and a face mask yet?? if not, get on it.....I dont want to see a delay-TWCBN needs to be evicted, and soon!  I may be having Stage 2a in May.....we may be able to take that hike to Iceberg Lake in Glacier together this summer-but you CAN NOT get sick, or hurt anymore in order to have surgery this week and have time to recover! Liefie, I'm sorry you get stuck with the tax c**p.  I can say that with great authority, as my DH is a CPA, and right now he is buried up to his eyeballs in tax c**p......before my 96 year old mother came to live with us and I was not a full-time caregiver, I would work in his office during the months of March and April......(actually s**t is more like it!  I hate numbers!)  So, I can't spell, and I can't do math.....obviously a grade school reject here! Websister-I hope your scan goes well.....and that you are doing okay.  How is mom?  I can only imagine that even though your mother does not live with you, that you have some of the same issues as I do with my mother......it's really hard to watch them \"crumble\" in front of us......I get stressed out over her a lot.....and am sure that stress did not help me in avoiding BC. Carla- I hope that you have a better day today than you are anticipating.  I have not done chemo, so can only imagine how hard it can be.  Since you live in the San Diego area-have you ever attended a play at the Old Globe in Balboa Park?  My DD#1 was in a production of \"The Pleasure of His Company\" there a few years ago.  My husband and I flew down twice to see it during its summer run.  It was delightful (I'm biased) and I loved Balboa Park, and hanging out in San Diego was a treat! Dakota-busy weekend?  Surgery this week?  I am thinking of you, and hope all is well. Traii-you had better be enjoying your holiday with the penguins......send pics please! To everyone else-I hope your week is starting out well, and that it continues that way! (((Hugs))) to you all! Namaste and God Bless - Jackie ",

Use the walker as long as you feel  the need for it...your back will ease up little by little...I STILL have some abdominal tightness at 3+ months!  You and I (and Liefie) have to meet and hike in Glacier.....Iceberg Lake is calling our names!  :-)  Hope you get some rest with the Flexeril......fingers crossed! Edi-hope you don't mind if I hijack your F**ket list.....(actually, I think You stole it from Me!)   You are a ray of sunshine for me.....love you to pieces.  Stay strong...you have a cruise awaiting you! (And I will be in your suitcase...please find a handsome Scotsman with great legs in a Kilt who doesn't mind being shipped to the USA.....I could use some arm candy!)  Hope DH isn't causing too much trouble for you!  How is cake business coming?  I would use you for special cakes if you lived a little closer..... they look yummy!   Traii-hope you are well, and family is good.....any movement on surgery date? Dakota....busy with sports/kids/ and still working full-time.....and you look gorgeous!  Hope you are healing and feeling good.  Glad the nightmare in Boston has subsided..... Carla, Caitlin, Scottiee and all.....have a good evening/night.... Namaste and God bless - Jackie",

Yesterday I was missing the sushi so much, I bought a rice press and made my own for dinner.  DH was pleasantly surprised (I think he was afraid I would say I was too tired to cook-again).  Sushi turned out amazingly well, for a beginner!  I have lost a few pounds since leaving for Japan, not sure that it is a result of my eating (less) over there (except for TimTams, Traii!), or the incessant walking and stair climbing from the subway stops.  Am trying some different things in the gym right now......stairstepping for 12 mins. straight -that's a lot for me!  .....  followed by 40 minutes of elliptical set at a low height and a higher resistance......seemes to be working, I am exhausted right now! I really missed chatting with all of you during my time in Japan, and that is one of the positives of being back....but, I find myself with not too much to say today!  Except that I want your scone recipe, Liefie.....you are a bad influence-mentioning scones with cream and strawberries...reminds me of my Cornish grandmother...she used to make them for me all the time when I visited her.  (Pasties are another favorite of mine, thanks to her....my family thinks I'm demented!) I DID see some Hokkaido Brown bears when in Japan.....but they were behind bars.  HUGE animals....similar to Alaskan Kodiaks...I believe that the Browns in Canada and the US are a little smaller, but that would be small consolation if you were being chased by one! I have got to say...the rescue pigeon story is pretty funny.  Sorry it doesn't like John Denver! (Or does it?) I hope ALL are having a good day....sun is shining here, and the temp will hit 80* +  today...... Love and (((Hugs))) going out to all!  Namaste and God bless - Jackie PS:  Traii...I found a site that will sell TimTams here in the US, for giving them your firstborn.....just kidding, but almost double what I paid for them in Japan!!!!",

Wish you were \"over here\".....I'd be knocking on your door constantly! You have a real knack for making people feel good. :) Websister, glad you had a good day......only 3 hours at work would be a good day in my book, too! Are you adjusting to becoming an empty nester, with your youngest out of HS, or will he live at home while pursuing work, or college? There are days when I miss my DDs.....and get nostalgic thinking about all the years when the house was filled with noise and activity......then they come home for a visit......and I am wondering how I managed all those years! How is the back pain? Better, I hope! Liefie, so glad you were able to have your lunch......I need to get together with the 3 other women from my neighborhood who have had BMXs.....but I am the only one with the DIEP.......it is nice to talk with others who \"get\" how you are feeling, and how you look at things..... Dakota, you are one busy woman! Your kids are so lucky to have you for a mom! Take care of yourself.....no LE for you! And as soon as you are not looking for him.....your Prince Charming will turn up somewhere in that busy life of yours! Benny, jealous you have that giant plush toy to take care of and love........but you DO work your rear end off caring for Diamond, and doing stuff at the barn......good for you! I hope you get all your \"swelling ?\" issues worked out.....very frustrating that you are not able to be seen now, when your symptoms are showing. :( Caitlin, it's always nice to hear from you, and I am so sorry you are so tired. Under the circumstances, with everything you have gone through, and all that has been done to you, you are pretty amazing. Hope the energy level picks up soon. Alive, enjoy your away time.....we will be here when you return. (But I know exactly how you feel....when I was in Japan, I couldn't always use the computer, and it really did put me out of sorts!) Coming back to reality was a real bummer! Only bright spot is this board! :) Jenny, Carla, Maria.......how are things with you? Hope any SEs are subsiding...... Traii, I am re-ordering MORE TimTams......they taste really good after being in the refrigerator when they are nice and cold! I am addicted......for sure! :). Maybe I will come to Australia, raise hell with your hospital, and hijack the TimTams from the factory......it could work..... :) I have been stair stepping 10 minutes or so every morning, and then doing the elliptical on a cross-country skiing mode.......might be enough to maintain my TimTam addiction.....if not, I am screwed......I can't do more than 60 minutes of cardio! I also do about 30 minutes of free weights (no more than 5 lbs. per arm since surgery).....used to use 12 lb weights, but those are too heavy now.....also starting to stretch out my abdomen....aka \"upward dog\". Yikes! Feels weird ! Trying to be prepared for the second step surgery.......fun times ahead, for sure! Love to all....... Namaste and God bless-Jackie",

Traii.....keep the drains until the output is minimal....my abdominal drain(one of them) malfunctioned and I ended up with an infection that blew the incision wide open.....NOT fun! :( Have taken a Percoset to help w/pain (and sleep)......... Love and post-root canal (((hugs))) to all! :) Namaste and God Bless - Jackie",

Apparently it is the first and last meeting I will have with him, as he is not going to recommend any further treatment for me, as he feels it would be redundant. Said that because I had the BMX, that he sees no need for further treatment. I am not sure how I feel about it, because I thought the addition of Evista (or some other drug like it, since I'm post-menopausal) would be the best thing to keep the BC B**ch from ever coming back. Part of me is relieved that I don't have to deal with the SE of the drugs, (as I have Osteoporosis) but the other part is feeling that panicky feeling of \"what if I am not doing enough?\". I realize this is small potatoes compared to what a lot of you wonderfully courageous women deal with on a daily basis, but I am coming to the realization that for each of us, no matter where we are on the BC spectrum, it is NEVER over. This becomes our new \"reality\". I know that several of you (Traii and et.al.) are dealing with chemo, and congrats to those of you close to being done with that.). I am so in awe of the graceful way you deal with it on a daily basis. Brave, brave women. Edi, I hope you are getting your rest! However, I am chuckling over your posts-you are a funny lady, and I am sure your sense of humor has gotten you through some tough times. Websister, you are amazing as well-caring for your mom as you navigate through all the cancer c**p. I care for my 95 year old mother, and between my BMX and recon and recovery, it has not been easy. Liefie, I see you use heat on your injuries , I used to, until my daughter started playing college soccer-the trainers would make the girls take ice baths to soothe their sore muscles. I have an old back injury that flares up every once in a while, so I use the ice for 20-30min every few hours. Seems to ease the pain, and I can move a little easier. I am envious of your swans.....the best I get are mallard ducks in my swimming pool during the spring, and they drive my two Labs bonkers. I have had to retrieve them more than once from the water and towel them off so they can go back inside-crazy dogs! Luvmy, where are the babies? Looking forward to hearing about them! Scottiee-good luck with the class. 40 is way too big! Have fun on your retreat! You deserve it. Dakota-I hope things will soon settle down a little for you. Sounds like you are headed in a good direction, but best keep a can of bug spray handy, just in case! Nihahi- your girls' weekend looked to be a smashing success! What a beautiful place you got yourself to! Loved the pics, and super jealous you were snowshoeing ....I will have to wait until next year.....I wear out too easily right now. I have some wildflower pics I want to post, but do I need to use Flickr or something like that? I don't know if I can just upload from my computer files directly. How did you do it? I hope ALL of you has a good (in every way) day today! Namaste and God Bless, Jackie",

That is exactly what you need to do, because you need to be in the best physical health AND the best mental/emotional health you can as you head into this surgery. Get something, and use it when you NEED to......it can be your lifeline to \"sanity\" as the time grows nearer and your nerves are all on overdrive. I am SO grateful that my PCP gave me a scrip for the Ativan......it saved me that last week! I also have a confession-as the time grew closer to surgery, I found myself veering away from all thoughts surgery/post-surgery/recovery related, and focusing on my post-surgical \"new me\". (For lack of a better description.) It really helped. I believe you said you were a nurse(?), so maybe this would be more difficult to do. I kind of adopted the yoga technique of meditating and putting myself \"there\". I am probably not explaining myself very well, but it's the same thing as your lovely meadow.....just imagine yourself there in your new (and \"improved\") body.

I am making my 96 year old mother ( with Alzheimer's ) wait for a few whilst I post here..... Spoke to Nihahi on DIEP thread......but wanted to say here how relieved I was to hear from you.....I was getting worried, and I hope that as you read this you are starting to see some improvement to those issues......DIEP is a hard surgery.....I liken it to being run over by a semi-truck, which then backs up, and rolls over you again! Slight exaggeration, but......the good news is, you generally see small improvement every day..... Another way to look at it is like a hike.....mostly uphill, with a few flat spots and a little downhill on your way to your destination. Speaking of hikes...when I was having a particularly hard time during the first 3 weeks....I would imagine myself hiking to Iceberg Lake.....the visualization REALLY helped me get over those \"speed bumps\" on the road to recovery....(I am just a little further down that road than you, is all) You are in my thoughts every day! :-) Liefie, as you approach your surgery date, take a few minutes every day to work on your abs......it really, REALLY does help! I was pretty flat on top after nursing 4 babies, but had a lovely, custom-made for DIEP, spare tire in just the right location. :-) My new girls are bigger, AND much perkier than my originals. They took some getting used to! Very happy now! Traii, the general rule for DIEP recovery is 6 weeks, but some of the ladies on the DIEP board have gone back to work in 4 weeks. I had some complications, 7-8\" of my abdominal sutures \"blew out\" b/c of infection. ( I was in surgery for 18 hours b/c one of my flaps failed due to restricted blood flow-I have tiny blood vessels-PS didn't want to lose it, so he opened me back up and fished around for another blood vessel in my abdomen to fix the problem. It was successful, but 18 hours is a LONG time to be opened up-you are asking for an infection like staph to settle in....) so......MY recovery was about 8 weeks, b/c I had to get re-sutured after the opened area healed up.....feeling great now, and my incision looks perfect....I think the PS did a little revising while in there sewing me back up. :-). Even with all the problems, I would do it again in a heart beat...... However, I am 58, and am not chasing after young children.....I may not have chosen this if I was. Keeping my fingers crossed that you get a date soon! Dakota, you busy, busy lady! And gorgeous, too! Can't believe you are so busy so soon after surgery! Be careful, okay? Reading about all you do makes ME tired! Websister, if you are considering DIEP, the wait may be worth it. I hope you are lucky and someone cancels their appt. and you get in sooner. It IS a big decision.....I feel lucky, I had a 2-2 1/2 month wait, it could have been 4, but someone cancelled, so I was able to take their spot. How is Mom? Settling in? Stressful caring for aging parents, isn't it? To be honest, I feel that a substantial amount of the depression I sometimes deal with has to do with that stress, and not my \"illness\". Oh well, won't last forever, will it? Take care. Edi.....you are one lucky lady! Can I squeeze in your suitcase along with Scottiee? I want to visit Scotland so much! Please send pics for me to enjoy vicariously, okay? And keep your house clean.....you NEVER know when I might show up on your front step! XO. Forgot to say how excited I am that you are making lovely cakes! Pics please! Hope the rads burn subsides.....does not sound fun. :-(. Besides, it cannot be allowed to interfere with your growing cake business! To all of you lovely, wonderful cyber-sisters......have a good day! (((Hugs))) Namaste and God bless -Jackie",

You know the old cartoons that have one of the characters step on a rake that then rises up and smacks him in the head? Well................I now am sporting a goose egg on my forehead.......that's all I'm saying about it......... :) Love to all..... Namaste and God Bless - Jackie",

Have a wonderful Easter with your family! (And no wrinkly butt....) Nihahi, so glad you are getting out and taking a hike today.....the farthest I have gone since surgery is 5 1/2 miles, and I was exhausted!  Think it will take time to build up to a\"real\" hike....hopefully by May/June!  Hope you took your camera and you will be treating us to lovely photos! (?)  I think about you and your daughter a  lot, and hope that moving in with you and DH will be a positive for her, AND you.  If she can do it, her help will be invaluable to you as you recuperate from DIEP.  (I'm out a little over 2 months, and I still wake up some days feeling like a truck has run over me, then backed up on me!)  But, overall, I am good. Traii, I hope you enjoy your holiday to  ???? Island....you deserve it.  (I don't have Chemo brain, but I DO have Anesthesia brain.....I am always a little fogged over!)  I would love to see a Penguin someplace other than at a zoo!  How nice that yu can just go to a beach and see them! Do you have a surgery date yet? ( I can't remember!) Dakota, sorry about the chipped teeth!  These kids......my four girls took damage like that as a badge of honor.....thought it made them look tougher than the other kids.....  I just hope he is careful from now on out....you have enought distractions!  :-)  Enjoy the transition from Hockey to Soccer for me....I miss those days!  My 27 year old DD is coming home from Japan for 3 weeks, and has been recruited to play in an Adult Indoor league (as a ringer...she played D1 in college) so I will get to watch my kid play once again, and to be honest, I love it!  If I wasn't so worried about injuring myself severely, I would sign up for the over 55 team.....since I had my DIEP surgery, I've become very protective of my \"adopted\" girls.....wouldn't want any harm coming to them, as I paid dearly to get them!  :-)   Hope Cockroach behaves himself this weekend, after all, it IS Easter....one can hope! Lieifie, have a wonderful time this weekend with your dinner guests!  I think it is great that you are having friends over to celebrate Easter.  If I didn't have at least one DD and family in town, I would do the same.  I am in awe that you play the organ at your church!  I become seriously paralyzed whenever I try to play ANYTHING in front of others!  My fingers feel like cement, and my brain goes into hibernation mode!  I can direct music, but even that is a little dicey in front of others!  I hope all goes well for you during the Easter service!  :-) Websister, I hope your mother is faring better.....life is never uncomplicated, is it?  While we worry about our own situations, we have parents that need us, and children that may become adults, but still require us for so much.....it's difficult to balance all of it sometimes.  I hope your cold is better, and that your Se's are managable.  Hope your Easter weekend is lovely!   Thanks again for the Benny update....I owe her alot, because her first post is what brought me to you wonderful women.  Caitlin, Carlads, Luvmy, and everybody else, I wish you all a wonderful weekend!  You are all such incredible, strong women....I fell blessed to have stumbled upon this thread! You really bouy me up......  :-) (((Hugs))) to you all! Namaste & God Bless - Jackie",

She is mobile, but suffers from old-age related Alzheimer's. The past several years have been very difficult to experience, as she has slowly lost her memory, and much of her ability to communicate. She remains very sweet, and never is angry, (I am the one that loses control sometimes) but it is like having a very large toddler to care for. On the DIEP thread one of the women wanted us to participate in a survey her daughter was taking so she could write about stress and breast cancer......I could write a book..... I have been trying to change my attitude and my approach to her, so have spent the weekend taking care of some things to help make her life (AND mine) easier. Ironic that it was Mother's Day here.....I didn't plan it that way. To be honest, I just skimmed the previous posts, so I apologize if I seem ignorant of when Britain, Canada, and Australia celebrate Mother's Day....but since it's our day here in the States, I will just say you are the greatest group of mothers I know....Mother's Day or no......you are awesome women!

I feel the same way about mine. @ Beargrass-I have only seen it in and around Glacier.......and on the high trails around Mt. Hood, as well as the Three Sisters Wilderness area of central Oregon. Most prolific in Glacier, though. Would the Banff-Jasper area have it? I would think so, as well as the Revelstoke area of BC?

It's hard enough to be dealing with our own health issues, but having children with issues certainly makes the BP rise. Traii and Dakota- two amazingly strong young women-bet you have no idea how much I look up to you. The big \"C\" is hard enough, but to deal with it when you have children at home........wow! Liefie, I need to learn to eat healthier, like you. I know I could do better than I do. Pet your Siamese for me. :-) Hoya-welcome! I am a DIEP-flapper(s) as well, and despite a few post-surgical complications, would do it again.....in a heartbeat! Hope all of you have a wonderful day......my only advice?

Right now my BC risk is about 1-2%, according to what my Onc said. Honestly, although I feel like I have been in a \"fight or flight\" mode for the past 5 1/2 months, I will be fine with calling it quits.....I don't think I could do hormone-blocking therapy as I am so osteoporotic and that stuff makes it worse.....QOL has to enter in somewhere! If taking the drug gave me at most another year overall, I would rather have one less year and no broken bones.....kind of a catch 22, I guess. I have all kinds of admiration and respect for you gals that have and do endure chemo. I know you don't do it for s***ts and giggles, but you DO it, with courage, and grace, and here I am whining about maybe having to take a stupid hormone-blocker......I guess deep down, I am basically a coward.

I want to come to England and meet you!  Anyone with the name Edith is awesome, in my book!   Congratulations on 44 years!  I feel accomplished with only 36!  Looking forward to hitting that milestone.  I have a funny \"Honeymoon Story\"..... my wedding day started out actually the night before, when I got the pre-wedding jitters so badly that nothing could help me sleep, so I end up rolling into the church with ZERO sleep.  I was a mess, and I probably looked it!  Wedding was at noonish, with a combined family brunch after at a restaurant close by.  During this affair, DH's aunt is going table to table, trying to sell a gasoline additive for \"better gas mileage\".  My father looks at me and says\" If she doesn't stop it right now, I'm going to throw her a** out\"  Don't remember who put the Kybosh on it (maybe DH), but she stopped.  This \"event\" ended around four, and we had to prepare for a formal reception that evening, so I was running on fumes by then....somehow managed to get through a 3 hour ordeal (reception), and then DH and I had to drive 150 miles to our honeymoon destination (poor planning on our part, for sure).  By then, I was almost comatose, and DH was not much better, but somehow we managed to get ourselves there, without any mishaps.  We staggered up to our suite, where I decided that I had to have a much-needed soak in the tub, as my legs and feet were KILLING me!  DH said he would be waiting for me, and not to take too long ...I promised I would not.  I drew a lovely warm bath, and laid back in it, and promptly went to sleep......I awoke 5 hours later in a freezing cold tub of water (I am lucky I didn't drown-if the tub had been any larger, I may have!).  I staggered out of the bathroom, and found my hubby fast asleep and still in his tuxedo over the bottom corner of the bed.  He confessed to me later that he had not slept the night before, but didn't want me to know out of fear I would feel hurt!  I still  laugh whenever I think of that night.....silly kids we were!   Traii, my bed is also way high....I am terrified of falling off, and landing on my $$$$ reconned noobs.  Right now I am not very spry /limber and a fall from that height could spell disaster for my two adopted girls! I hope you are resting well, and that your SE are not causing too much misery. Websister, I hope you are taking it easy this weekend....your days make me very tired, and I haven't had rads OR chemo!  I do exactly what you do when DH takes off in the mall....I slow WAY down until he notices I am not next to him.  This usually happens 2-3 times (he's a slow learner) and then he finally slows down enough for me to stay with him. Nihahi, I am so sorry to hear about your childrens' struggles.  Watching your kids go through these health challenges is stressful, and heartbreaking.  #4 daughter  has been diagnosed with severe endometriosis AND ulcerative colitis. It so affects the overall quality of life for her, a great deal of the time. It's devastating for all of us. You are right about Iceberg Lake being prime Grizzly country, but so many people make the hike, that the bears usually stay down below in the upper meadow, or high above on the upper slopes above the trail.  I HAVE, however, been accosted by a very large male Moose, which came crashing through the trees and brush from below the trail, and  burst out on the trail 20 feet behind us.  Of course we were startled, (thinking it was a bear) and were reaching for our bear spray, when he burst through.....I don't know what we would have done if it HAD been a bear-we were all struck stupid when it happened!  :-/  The moose was annoyed we were there on HIS trail, and he was walking towards our small group to investigate.....we kept retreating up the trail, all of us trying not to think of things we know about moose: (how aggresive and dangerous they are, how you should never get too close-things like that), when he gave us one rather short charge, and then bolted up the hill, in the same direction he was headed when he *bumped* into us! Liefie, you are probably back to Vanc. Island by now....I hope you are still feeling the warm Carribean sunshine in your heart!  (And that you are completely relaxed and refreshed.)  Sorry that DH will need to return to his practice.....he probably needs to have a vacation from his vacation! Lovmy-LUV your opinion about the only perfect man...... short and to the point!  Where are pictures of your new kiddies?  I love goats, and would love to be able to have a few here, but we are not zones for anything other than chickens (NO roosters!). Dakota, if I lived on the East Coast, I'd buy lobster from your kids!  You are a good mom, and I know you'll find a way to get past the cockroach problem......as has already been said- you've been kicking breast cancer's a**! I hope you can get clarity on how to proceed from here. To the rest of you courageous, amazing ladies-have a lovely weekend, with few se's, and lots of rest! For you all (since it's St. Patrick's Day-at least it is here in the States)....Since my GGrandmother was Irish- May the road rise up to meet you,  May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine warm on your face,  The rains fall soft upon your fields, And until we meet again May God hold you In the palm of His hand. Namaste and God Bless... Jackie",

I think you should at least consider forgoing all activities that are not necessary to ensure your surgery date doesn't change!  Edi, you sound as though you had a wonderful day in front of you.....and I am sure you took advantage of it.  PLEASE come to Oregon and clean out my garage.....I pulled into it this afternoon, and got tired just looking at all the junk!  At the very least you should come and entertain me while I clean it!   Websister, I know what you mean about doing some things to counteract the stress brought on by things you can't control.  Sometimes I feel doing MORE of what I like to do is the only thing that keeps me from going completely off the deep end. Liefie, your menu for today's dinner sounded positively mouthwatering.......I think we all should plan a weekend getaway at YOUR place.....I would just sit around and wait for the delicious food to be served!  I am glad you are feeling a little better....hope you are not exhausted by the company, but I think that if we can take the focus off of \"us\" for a bit (and plan a dinner party for 10, for instance) we DO end up feeling at least somewhat better.  Hope it went well, but getting to know you on this forum, I am SURE it went very well. Caitlin, what was your focus in Grad School?  How long did you live in Corvallis?  For some reason, I am thinking you are in Canada now?  I'm so sorry you are suffering from SE's......hope they even out and you can feel better soon. Dakota-when is surgery?  Bet your weekend was busy as ever with your kidlets going in every direction! Traii-hope you have tons of fun on your trip to Phillips Island.....please watch DS so he doesn't try to penguinnap a souvineer!  ( I am not sure I spelled that right-someone please correct me!) Scottiee, glad you are doing okay! Class(School) is keeping you busy! Well, I have had an intense day, and am exhausted.....may need to take a nap! Namaste and God Bless - Jackie",

Liefie, I am like you, I can work like a dog at the gym, and see absolutely NO difference-and I eat healthy, too!  It can be VERY frustrating to deal with.  Seriously considering going Vegetarian when all my surgeries are finished.....I am sorry I did not connect that you were going to be a future DIEPer.....I am clueless!  With my DIEP surgery, I got a flat stomach, but someone asked me if the surgery had caused me to lose weight.....maybe a few ounces if you count my real boobs out!  Seriously?  WHO asks that??? Nihahi-i think the busier you are the faster this time will fly.....is there any way to be super busy and still have no stress?

Traii keeping my fingers crossed that your surgery will be decided VERY SOON.......I can imagine how stressful that could be......but at least you aren't facing a huge recovery time-frame.  I think if this had happened to me when I was younger, I would have done implants....and come back to DIEP later....it is a long(6 weeks) recovery....hard when you have kids to look after.  Hope DS is doing well....would love to see pics of your trip....guess I'll have to facebook you. :-) Dakota-glad you got a night off!  I remember when I would breathe a secret sigh of relief when games would be cancelled......after a while your whole life feels like a merry-go-round........going going going all the time.  It's nice to have the kids to yourself once in a while, ALONE...  :-)  Hope you are healing well-you sure sound like you are.

No seroma, just swelling. Dr thinks because I technically had surgery in that area twice ( due to infection and blown-out sutures), that it is just over-traumatized , and needs more time to settle down. Works for me.....now I can plan a trip to visit #3 daughter in Sapporo, Japan, then plan a trip to Glacier in Early August just before revision surgery, where my doggie ears get removed to make nips, and the fat gets vacuumed out to plump up the girls.....looking at about a 3 week recovery period, with 2-4 days mostly down and resting. Doable, but not at the expense of ruining my summer hiking plans! Liefie, I am cranking up big elevations gains on the tread.....1800 ft over 2.2 miles in just under 45 minutes. Nihahi says I am ahead of her, but I don't believe that for one second......she LIVES in the mountains! Even jogging a bit, and the new girls don't seem to mind at all!:).

I bet we would have a wicked good time, and we would find that flower-filled meadow we all like to retreat to every once in a while!

Tammy-if you were closer, you COULD join us!  We could hike to the base of Mt. Wilbur (really!) together, and leave a stack of rocks, like they do in Hawaii......I am sure Nihahi will post pics.....and they will most likely be very embarassing to me...... I am way out of shape......this has NOT been my year.....or anybody else's year, either!  Liefie-I liked your sis's joke....I may have to apply to myself!   You will have to give in to temptation and buy a package of the TimTams......I promise you will not be sorry....just don't let DH see them, or you may not get another....I am lucky, DH is gluten-free.....yay!  Anesthesia Brain is bad today.....i cannot remember if I told you how happy I was your doggie returned......such good news! By the way-doggie pathology report bac- lowest stage Mast Cell Cancer, and VERY clear margins.....so, until the next one crops up (these sometimes do that, but not considered mets) she's clean....kinda like me, I guess..... Dakota, you are probably sick of hearing this....but I agree with the ladies.......cockroach needs to move on....you want to let daughter know that no one needs to put up with bad behavior, and that she is worth enough to expect a man to be kind and decent.....you are a beautiful woman......hold out for Prince Charming!  Sending you (((HUGS)))! XO Carla-sending you positive vibes that you receive good news this Friday......and prayers heaven-ward! Maria-glad you had such fun with your friend.......thank goodnes for them, right? Nihahi........looking forward to rendevouz on Saturday!  TOWANDA!  Caitlin-nice to hear from you! Traii and Benny and Websister......I hope you are all doing well.  Thinking of you all! Love to all!
