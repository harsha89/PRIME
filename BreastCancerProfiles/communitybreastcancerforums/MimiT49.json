I have to have 33 treatments and I'm almost done (have 2 1/2 weeks left!). I have already been through 6 rounds of chemo, surgery and now doing radiation. I am so tired!!!!! Anyway, wanted to join this group because I'm having extreme fatigue and my underarm is starting to turn black and hurt, so thought I'd see if anyone else was experiencing the same. I also have numbness/tingling/pain in my hands and feet from chemo that are worse with the radiation.",
