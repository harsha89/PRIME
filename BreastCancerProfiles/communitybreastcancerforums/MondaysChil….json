I am newly diagnosed with mets to the lungs. Lots of tiny bits everywhere, in all five lobes. 100% ER+ and 100% PR+, Her2-. Grade 2. No symptoms, discovered accidently as part of an annual physical which included a low dose CT lung cancer screening instead of the usual x-ray. Lung biopsy using VATS technique last week confirmed breast cancer mets to lungs. CT scanned today to see if the size of any of the mets meets minimum size for clinical trial. If not, we will starting Faslodex asap. I have been on letrozole since September, 2011 so everyone is amazed I have had this occur with 100% ER+.",

Not that there was no uptake, just too small to see on PET. Yet mine are all 5mm and less and still showed. My thoracic surgeon intended to get two nodules and that is what he got. At my initial meeting with him, he told me he intended to go in the right side and knew just where he was going to go. I was later told this guy is doing some pretty cutting edge stuff related to lungs and cancer surgery, so maybe he is able to zero in and get very small ones in a manner they are able to be dealt with in pathology. And do it with less trauma. Don't know. If you would like your new oncologist to consult with my oncologist and/or this surgeon, send me a PM and I will give you their names and contact information and identifying information about me. Maybe they can share something about my case that would shed light on yours. This having a bunch of small stuff scattered everywhere in the lungs is not a normal presentation, so maybe there is something in my info that can help you.",

I was a 7:30am start last Thursday Feb 4, scheduled for 2 hours total OR time. VATS is video assisted so much less invasive than traditional open lung biopsy. There are two small incisions and then a bigger one where a large bore chest tube was placed. You must stay in intensive care until the chest tube is removed, normally a day or two after surgery. Mine was removed the next day. I had dilaudid (sp?) for pain relief which I needed for a sharp pain in my back. That stopped immediately after removal of the chest tube and I have not even needed so much as Tylenol since. After the one day in ICU, I was moved to a regular floor and spent one day there and then home late afternoon on Saturday. I actually went into my office a short while on Sunday and worked short days Monday and Tuesday and all day Wednesday other than onc appointment. First follow up with my oncologist yesterday who informed me the thoracic surgeon had told him this is one of the most painful surgeries there is, but I found it to be much better than expected. I remain pretty amazed at how well I have done (am at work now!). I read of others saying the pain was manageable and not too bad. Part of the worst was no food or drink for more than a day. Just ice chips. My mets are just odd all the way around. They are sub-centimeter, the largest being 5-6mm. And they STILL lit up on a PET scan, which they were never expected to be able to do. For you, did they actually try to run a PET or just assume they were too small? My original CT report said they would not be resolvable by PET, but my onc ran one anyway and there they showed. So a search for \"VATS\" and you can find a few posts and none of the ones I found indicated they thought the procedure too, too bad.",

The PET scan process causes highly active cells to attract a radioactive material injected in you right before the scan. That is referred to in the report as SUV uptake. The more uptake, the more active the cells...as in rapidly dividing like cancer cells do. The helps diagnose what is seen on a CT scan. Typically, the mass has to be a minimum size to be detectable through a PET scan. Sub-centimeter nodules like I have are not normally able to be seen on a PET so it demonstrates how very active they are. They sucked up a lot of the juice for being such tiny little buggers.",

They got two nodules with wedge resection. To my surprise, even though small, they are big enough to do lots of stuff: determined they are both 100% ER and 100% PR responsive (original was 99% and 95%). Also had plenty to send out for genetic testing. Go figure. I had the crap scared out of me too over this and was really worried. I was more afraid of the procedure itself than what it might reveal. But turns out not bad at all and I am very glad I did it because I now have solid answers. Mine are smaller than yours. The largest one I have is a one that was 6mm. The rest are all smaller, but clearly very active since they can be seen faintly lighting up on the PET scan. I still have my ovaries but I was already post-menopausal at my original diagnosis.",

With all options, you will have no sensation and no pleasure from them after the mastectomies.  At your age, possibly wanting to breastfeed in the future is also a consideration. Reoccurence and getting all of the cancer removed is a very legitimate and important concern.  Make your medical decisions based on that.  Reconstruction is not all the great thing it is made out to be.  It is a long, time consuming, difficult process and the end the results can be very dissappointing and not at all what you expect them to be. Few of us are prepared adequately for any of that or even told that part. Reconstruction will always be a second best to not having needed our breast removed. It is a pretty lousy consolation prize.",
