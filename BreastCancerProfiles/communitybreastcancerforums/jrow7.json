He said he would release the path report to my online chart so I could see it. I've pasted it below. Is it me or does the path say not only DCIS but IDC as well?

Had blood drawn today for genetic testing, we should know that result sometime next week. Chance is minimal but insurance covered it so why not be extra sure, right? No chemo before. Surgery is scheduled for 2/13, large lumpectomy, left breast. BS is going to take the area from noon to 3 out, which will reduce the size of my left breast. She's going to reduce the size of my right breast at the same time - also moving my nipple upwards so that both of my nipples will be at the same location. I begged her to do as much as she can in one operation because I do not want to keep resetting my \"healing clock\" to deal with this. Praying for clean margins so I can heal and prepare myself for the next step in this battle. That's about it for now. I'm sticking with my Dr in NH vs Boston - just didn't get the best feeling being down there (too many people). ",

Yes I do have both DCIS and IDC but it's quite an early dx. I have a breast MRI scheduled for Monday with a follow-up appointment on Wednesday. We need to wait and see if lumpectomy + radiation or mastectomy. They would like me to have genetic testing since I'm on the younger side - which I'm going to have done because depending on that, it may be a factor in having a bilateral mastectomy - and the fact that we have 3 daughters (and 2 sons). I don't feel I need a second opinion but I am being urged by a few to head into Boston since \"that's where the best Dr's are\". I have asked for opinions on my current Dr and I have looked up her experience and I feel she is a good match to my personality. I'm comfortable with how we are approaching this. But we shall see....I may cave to the pressure. The hardest part has been saying \"I have breast cancer\" to my Boss, my coworkers, and friends. (I have a wonderful relationship with my boss & co-workers so that's why I told them.) So that's it for now....waiting patiently for Monday...feeling much more at ease....and continually reminding myself to focus on God... Much love to all ~ Jenn",

I'll do Taxol + Herceptin afterwards so we aren't in the same situation but I figured I'd share anyways since I think I have a \"good\" story. Day of AC I feel like my head is \"thick\" and feels horribly hung-over. Nausea and heartburn kick in around evening time. (My nurse is going to give me more fluid this week and see if that helps with the head complaint). For the next couple of days I take anti-nausea med, dexamethasone, Claritin, and Zantac then I drop the steroid and keep going with the other ones. I hydrate as best I can and nap or just lay low. Appetite takes a few days to come back but until then I just eat when I feel I can handle it. This last round wasn't as bad as the first, I made sure to keep sipping ice cold liquids or chew ice while the nurse administered the AC and I didn't have as many mouth sores and didn't feel like I had burned my whole mouth on something. I also started taking Claritin the day of so I didn't have too much bone pain - sternal pain but no hip/spine pain. My last AC was on a Wednesday so I took Thursday and Friday off. I worked the following Monday, Tuesday, took Wednesday off, worked Thursday then went to Drill Friday through Sunday. I would say I'm back to myself 100% around day 9-10. I wish you all the best in your treatment!",
