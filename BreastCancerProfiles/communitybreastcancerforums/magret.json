Is there anything else I should ask?  I feel like I should have been given more information.  Would the mammogram/ultrasound have had a BI-RAD score?  They didn't offer one, but I didn't know enough at that point to ask.  Anything you can offer is much appreciated!  While I was initially very relieved to get the call about the MRI results, I now feel a bit concerned that I should have more information about what is going on.  thanks!  Log in to post a reply",

Again - thank you so much!  Without your nudge, I might have just waited for til my annual exam (12 months!) and driven myself (and everyone else) crazy.",
