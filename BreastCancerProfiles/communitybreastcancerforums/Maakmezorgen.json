Well, since then I have had a surgical biopsy and I just got the results yesterday. Everything is fine!!! The only thing is that I need to see the oncologist again in 4 months. This and the fact that I don't completely understand the report he sent me, leave me with a bit of doubt. Don't get me wrong, I am very very very happy that everything turned out to be benign!!! I just want to know what the results mean. I will contact my doctor on Monday but I thought maybe one of you can explain a few things. The report is in Spanish so my translation might not be 100% accurate: Ductal microcalcifications associated with ductal hyperplasia non-atypicalcribriform & apocrine micropapillary with associated fybrocycstic disease of the breast. Thank you all so much for your support!

I haven't been diagnosed but I am worried at the moment. My own mother past away in June after fighting with breast cancer for 6 years. I normally get checked once a year and have just been checked. On the mamograph they noticed some microcalcification, which I didn't have last year. They got me to do an ultrasound too and even though they didn't find anything, they mentioned \"classification 0\" on the result paper. My doctor therefore recommends extra testing. I must say that I am very scared at the moment as I am not sure what kind of tests they will do or what microcalcifications might mean for me...  The reason I am writing this is because I just have to get this off my chest, I guess. And maybe someone who has been in the same position can tell me their story. I now that everyone is different and that I will simply have to wait untill next week but at the moment it seems light-years away...
