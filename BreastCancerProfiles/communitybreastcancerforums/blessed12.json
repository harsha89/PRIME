The findings on my original mammo report are:  Finding 1 - Intramammary lymph nodes are in both breast are benign-negative.  Finding 2 - New mass in the right breast requires additional evaluation.  Additional projections are recommended.  Spot compression is recommended.  An ultrasound exam of the right breast is recommended. Of course, ever since I was called I have been so worried.  Log in to post a reply",
