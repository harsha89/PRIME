It seems like a distant memory and it will for you too. The hardest part for me was when I was getting tatooed and measured because I don't like laying still. I must confess a little Atavan did the trick for that problem. The radiation treatment itself is nothing although it is a bit disconcerting when everyone goes out of the room and leaves you there alone and you do have to lie still while the machine is on. I just visualized that the treatment was bringing me good health. It is very very fast. I loved my treatment team and actually enjoyed going there everyday. It was a time when I needed to feel that someone really cared about me, and they did. I also enjoyed getting to know the other patients who were always there for their appointments as well. After every treatment, I put on aloe vera lotion that I kept in the refrigerator. Throughout the day, I put on calendula ointment. I did not really burn til the last week when I looked like I had a rash from shaving. You can't tell now, and I am enjoying wearing my bathing suit (with sunscreen of course) this summer. Also, it was cold in the treament room so I wore a cardigan sweater every morning that I could keep on til the last second. Good luck. It is another step, and you are on your way.",

I have very light skin and they look like ink smears on it. Several times people have asked me what they are, and I have ended up sharing information I had wished to keep private. I am wondering if anyone has had their's lasered off. I know this is petty, but I have a friend who is a medical aesthetician who has offered to do it, and I am very tempted. Am I missing something or would it probably be okay to do it now? I would appreciate any opinions out there. Hope everyone is well. Log in to post a reply",

I will do anything to at least forestall going through this again. My doctors explained that after lumpectomy, the radiation and tamoxifen got me down to close to the chance of the average bear in terms of a reoccurrence. I will take that and move on. Right now I am typing this from a B&B in Beijing where I have come with my husband to visit our son. Life is good! That's all I can ask for.",
