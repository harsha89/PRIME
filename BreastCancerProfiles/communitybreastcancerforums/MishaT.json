I developed thrombosis which hopefully will go away soon and I have a good amount of internal scarring below the incision site. Being just 6 weeks out, I assume this will soften naturally as time goes on. However, given its placement, I am worried about the ability to do adequate BSEs in the future. In your experience, is there anything I can do to soften that tissue, whether massage, certain types of foods, etc? TIA Log in to post a reply",

In my case, the pain appears to be related to fibrocystic breast condition. My breasts are naturally lumpy, bumpy, prone to thickened areas. Some people with breasts like these have cysts that come and go with their cycles. Cyclical pain is common with it as well. I found a lump deep in my breast, and I got it biopsied and it was found to be focal adenosis, which is not cancer. You never know what these spots, lumps, or bumps are, but the chances are good they are not cancer. Knowing that logically, though, is hardly adequate for chasing away the fear. I was a terrified mess going through my ordeal (which took about a month from u/s to getting the results of my surgical biopsy). And, even though I ended up with a benign finding, the honest answer is I still feel shaken by this experience. The muscles in my back are so tense right now, it's not even funny. And I'm supposed to be feeling \"relief.\"Â  Cancer is no joke, though. Fear doesn't help, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. The best you can do is just try to keep kicking through the fear.",

I am 42 now but was first diagnosed with fibrocystic breasts when I was 19. Your hormones are always changing, so it's not only a condition that affects 30 and 40 year olds. My doctor at the time took it seriously. These can cause shooting pains that radiate into the armpit and down the arm. I have dealing with that off and on all year. It's possible I had associated pain before then, but I have just become more anxious about breasts and breast health, so it could have gone unnoticed. Did the breast surgeon just give you a physical exam? If she didn't feel lumps, I am not sure what other screenings she could recommend. In my case, at 19, the doctor referred me for ultrasound, but I did have palpable lumps. Without that, there is nothing to image.And mammos aren't that useful for young women. Even at my age, I have very dense breasts, and cancer can be missed easily. For peace of mind, I would just go see another doctor. If he or she comes to the same conclusion (no lumps, fibrocystic condition), then I would feel assured.",

I thought you find a lump, they give you chemo, you get sick until you get better. But, then, I started reading and I've learned how sneaky it is, how detection isn't straightforward, and it can be lurking in there at advanced stages without you even knowing it. I have some hope (from doctors) that my lump is b9, but that is little consolation because of all these fears that have come through knowledge. I don't know what the answer is in your case. I think there is probably a happy medium between preventative mastectomy and just letting it go without further investigation. I think the thing to do is start with mammo and u/s if indicated.

I am going through something similar though....I had a clear mammogram but I felt a hard lump in my breast near the armpit that doesn't feel mobile to me. I have had an ultrasound, and the radiologist told me it looks like a healthy lymph node. I didn't get any details, though, so I have no idea of size. Mine is also tender and I have a very dull pain that sometimes shoots down my arm and into my nipple even. I have been googling and freaking myself out. There are so many breast cancer cases with symptoms like mine as well as no lumps even, just thick breast tissue. Well, I have thick tissue on the left side ( where this lymph node is) and my nipple restracts ( I think this has always been the case), I have family history, blah blah blah. I also have young kids- 8 and 6- and having them just makes the worry unbearable. The breast surgeon wants me to get the node biopsied, which I am doing in about 2 weeks. But, I've come to realize breast cancer is a sneaky little beast....I am worried I will always be a little fearful and stressed now since my u/s tech also did not examine my entire breasts...I try to keep it in perspctive but dang that is hard :-/",

I found a lump AFTER a clear diagnostic mammo, then was sent for u/s. The radiologist did give me my results immediately; he came in to talk to me, but the tech told me sometimes the radiologists at my hospital just relay information through the techs. I was told it was a suspected lymph node with a low chance of being cancer. I later had the thing removed, and the radiologist was right and wrong. He was right that the mass was benign, but he was wrong in thinking it was a lymph node. It was a focal adenosis. I hope you can find a way to bide the time without too much worry, and I hope you get good news on Monday! There are lots of things your lump can be that are not cancer!!! Keep telling yourself that!",

I had it checked by ultrasound at 16 weeks, then again at 24 weeks. Both times, the radiologist determined normal looking lymph nodes that are not clinically enlarged. On the latest ultrasound (Sept 9), the radiologist noted improvement in the nodes and gave me a BIRADS 2 rating, and the breast surgeon recommended just watching and waiting to see what happens after the baby is born. He's not very concerned. All of this left me feeling a bit uncomfortable simply because some people may recognize my name. I went through a ridiculous, totally self-induced melodramatic breast cancer freak out early in the year. The mass ended up being benign. However, the radiologist on the earlier breast lump also told me I had a node (from ultrasound), when the excisional biopsy found the mass actually was not a node...so now, I'm a bit skeptical about how easy it is to decipher lymph nodes from other types of masses. I just went for a second opinion last week. From palpation, this doctor (also a general surgeon affiliated with a breast clinic) said she didn't find the mass concerning but, to ally my concerns, she gave me a needle biopsy right then and there (not core). I'm waiting for the results now...and have remained fairly calm.... But, I would just feel so much better if this wasn't happening. No one can really tell me if armpit lump development is a semi-normal response to pregnancy. Any experiences from others here (either recently or when they were going through pregnancies), especially those with fibrocystic breasts? Log in to post a reply",

Overall, it didn't feel like that big of a deal. The placement of the wire was somewhat uncomfortable, it hurt to move my arm on that side. They knocked me out really well, so I have no memory of the surgery, and I slept like a fiend afterwards- to the point that they wanted to discharge me but I was too sleepy to move, lol. Today, I have a little swelling in the breast and a small amount of discomfort, especially when I have to put weight on it- like if I need to get myself up, or put on clothes, etc etc. But, I haven't needed to take painkillers. NOw, the worst thing that happened is that I now have blurry vision and a small amount of occasional dizzyness. They gave me an anti-nausea patch, and blurred vision/ dizziness is a common side effect. Hopefully, it will go away really soon. So, now it's just a waiting game.",

I have had it for a long time (upwards of 6 months now). I can tell you what's been happening with me and how they've been handling my care, to compare to yours.... I called a general surgeon right away when I discovered my lump (I don't need referrals with my health plan). This is because I have had lumps before, and I recently had a surgical biopsy ( less than a year ago). I am pregnant so could not be referred for mammography, which is the normal first step for many women when a lump is found. Instead, he referred me for an ultrasound. The radiologist discovered normal looking and normally sized nodes. I went back to the GS, and he didn't want to biopsy given arteries in the region of my nodes. He sent me back for another ultrasound, to monitor the nodes, after a certain number of weeks. They still looked good to the radiologist, slightly smaller and still normal looking. She or he rated my lump BIRADS 2. A few weeks after that, I decided to get a second opinion because my lump started to feel different to me- although I was just entering my third trimester, and I was feeling breast changes on both sides. This new surgeon did a needle biopsy on the spot, and that biopsy came back negative for cancer. She also has me going back for another ultrasound in about 2 weeks from now ( 4 weeks from my appointment). Both doctors want me to get a mammo asap, like right after my baby is born. That was totally long winded and probably unnecessary, I just realized. Sorry :-) It sounds to me like your GP is assuming its a node and waiting to see if it goes down with antibiotics. If it doesn't, you mightw ant to ask to be referred to a breast specialist and also radiology. A mammo might not be recommended for you since you are so young, But, an ultrasound is easy enough to do, and they can visualize the lump, determining now suspicious for malignancy it appears. You might also want to ask about MRI, which they say is a better alternative for young women with dense breasts. I'm not sure why my first doc was so reluctant to do a biopsy ( he considered doing a core needle biopsy when i first went to him but decided against it- everyone has been cautious with me now that I'm pregnant compared to the first time I had a breast lump). The thing we have to worry about with armpit lumps is BC but also lymphoma. personally, I don't feel entirely comfortable with leaving something like this unmonitored. it doesn't sound like you do either. just be sure to convey that to your doctor!!",

I have fibrocystic breasts, and my breasts get thicker and lumpier between ovulation and my period, and this happens in the left more than the right. This is a pretty common phenomenon that is accompanied by cyclical pain. Swollen lymph nodes are not part of this condition, but armpit tingling and pain can be (it is for me). That's because your breast tissue goes pretty deep and you can feel breast sensation in the armpit. If you find this is not cyclical, I would definitely keep a close eye...and probably pursue it again.",

When I had an appointment with the breast surgeon, he mentioned my inverted nipple on the left breast. For the life of me, I can't remember if this is new or not. I have a history of inverted nipples. Despite difficulties with the first one, I breastfed both of my kids for a total of about 5 years. I have been done with breastfeeding for about 2.5 years now. I know breastfeeding pulled the nipples out, but unevenly. I remember one of them being pulled out really well and the other more imperfectly. But, I have no recollection of which one was the shy one before all this BC scare stuff started- my guess is that it must have been the left that remained flatter. Since the BS mentioned my nipple, I have started perceiving a slight pulling sensation in that nipple. I have no idea if this is new, old, or I'm imagining it entirely. I have also noticed something about the nipple that I don't remember from before. Right underneath it and on the areola, there is what i call a pillow- a little pocket that surrounds the bottom of the nipple when it is inverted. If I push my right nipple in, this pillow also appears, so I don't know if it's normal for my breast or something terrible. The left nipple is inverted more often than it's erect, and the pillow is always there, even when erect (not so on the right breast). The inversion is worse when I am laying down; it seems to pop out more when I am standing up. It pops out close to totally when i pull on it or stimulate it in some way. I want to kick myself for not having more awareness of what my nipples were like before all this started....but, all of this is freaking me out so bad. I am now worried the lymph node is not really the culprit and there's a mass somewhere else or, even worse, IBC. I have no other symptoms of IBC, no swelling, heat, splotches, etc, but my mind is going there. I have an appointment with my GYN on Wed, and have an excisional biopsy on Jan 31. I guess my questions for you are: 1. Is there anyway my inverted nipple and pillow could just be normal for me and my mind is racing? Did any of you have symptoms that turned out to be benign? 2. When I show up for the excisional biopsy, can I ask them to investigate the nipple too, even though that's not in my chart? 3. What kind of testing can be done on the nipple? There is no lump, just the restraction/inversion and the slight tugging feeling. This is making me so crazy... don't know how I'm going to make it through the next 2 weeks. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2013 05:53PM - edited Feb 5, 2013 05:53PM by MishaT I worked myself up to an INSANE level before mine. None of it having to do with surgery and all of it with the anticipation of the results. Part of it was, the night before the lumpectomy (that's what my doc calls it), I discovered a tiny little lump in my areola and I was FREAKED. I was physically sick, slept NOT AT ALL, there was tension in every little ounce of my body..... Luckily, I was able to convince the radiologist to check out the spot in my nipple that I was feeling and it was just a milk duct...my surgeon also felt it and said glandular...and the lump is not there anymore. I swear, either my body thinks it's crazy hysterical to feed my cancer fear or all the tension was forcing my milk duct to bulge.... I am now on day 5 of waiting for the pathology report. My surgery was scheduled for a Thursday, meaning a weekend lull, and I will never do that again. The good thing about the surgery is that is knocked me out for nearly two days, and I got some reprieve from the fear and panic and agony. It's back now. This totally sucks donkey tail, ammonova. There's not getting around it. I'm wishing you b9 in the next couple of days.",

I was SO convinced it was something and i couldn't stop imagining all the worst case scenarios. i was a MESS and barely functioning until results came back. Unfortunately, right after that relief, my dermatologist suspected melanoma, and I had another FREAK OUT. this went on for about 2 months because, insanely, I kept getting new growths on my skin. i know it makes rational sense to say don't borrow trouble, no sense worrying until you have something to wory about, blah blah. BUT, that is very much easier said than done. So, I went the opposite direction with my fear. I decided to allow myself to feel what i was feeling and take that the 3 or so months that all the BC then melanoma testing took on me to be selfish and pitiful. For me, I think I just needed to do that. In hindsight, I'm glad I did because I learned from it. I have since had MORE breast lumps and skin growths and i am able to confront all the testing anxiety much better. G/L to you and I'm hoping for benign results!",
