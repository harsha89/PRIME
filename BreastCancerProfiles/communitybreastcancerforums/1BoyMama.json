Or just ibuprofen or other oral pain reliever? I came through much better skin wise than my radiation oncologist thought I would. Up till the last week I only had red, dry itchy skin. My under arm area where they removed lymphnodes was the most red and irritated. It was not too bad until this last treatment.. it woke me up whenever i moved last night.
