I have noticed lately after losing a little weight about 15 pounds that my right breast went back to the smaller size it used to be, however my left breast is still larger. I know that one breast is always slightly larger then the other but this is very noticeable, like I would say my left breast is a full cup to cup and a half larger then my right breast. There is no pain and I did a breast exam and feel no lumps, or bumps or anything hard etc. there is no nipple discharge but really I am freaking out worried. I am 35 so it is not like I am still developing. I am calling my gyno tomorrow but has anyone else had an experience like this? My Mom's sister has had breast cancer, and my dad's mom has had it twice so it runs on both sides ofmy family.Â  I am really worried. I have 3 young kids and when I saw on a breast cancer website that change in breast size can possibly be breast cancer it just scared me. I am hoping it is just my tendency to worry too much that is kicking in right now. Log in to post a reply",
