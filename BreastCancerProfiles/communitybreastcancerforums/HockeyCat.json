I really want it get colored as my gray hair getting so long, but looks like everyone waited for at treat 8-12 weeks PFC. Hope this forum will pick up and get more postings.

I didn't want to wash my hair, as I was worried about losing more hair. I had to wash it today and it lost alot. I think I'm going to wait until shedding subsides before switching shampoo.",

My husband plays roller and ice hockey, then he got me into it a few years ago. It is FUN! I'm taking a break right now but plan to go back after I recover from chemo. ",

They said it'l be much shorter next time. I got my appointment schedule for next 7 weeks. First week is tough, my appointments are everywhere. Then 3 weeks of late afternoon appointments, then the rest are in early morning. I plan to work full time but it may become difficult when I have to leave early every day.

I started rad yesterday too. I haven't had any side effect yet. Still have some lingering SE from chemo though... Are you a Canuck fan? ",

In retrospect, Rad wasn't too bad for me. The toughest part was fatigue. Going there everyday while working full time was hard. Luckily my skin tolerated it well. My skin got pink then turned brown, some skin peeled under breast and armpit. I drank a lot of water every day, I think that helped a lot. When my skin got burn and became painful, I applied Aloe Vera gel first then Aquafor on top. It kept moisture inside, and reduced the discomfort. It's been almost 7 months since my diagnosis. I had painful wire localization before the surgery, lumpectomy, 4x chemo with cold capping, and 33 rounds of radiation. It was a long journey. Not over yet. I'm seeing my MO next week to discuss my next step (hormone therapy). Good luck everyone. Hope your rad goes smoothly as well.",

It's going to be a busy holiday season for me... It's annoying that I have to wait until my first treatment day to schedule the rest of the appointments. They are pretty busy, so my first appointment is during lunch time. I live close by the center, but work a half hour away from there. Ideally I can do in the morning then go to work, but it didn't look like they don't give me much choice for the first few weeks...",

Rad tech gave me the diploma and hug. :) They told me to continue on skin care until the follow up but my skin is healing well. I used aloe vera gel and aquafor. I put aloe vera whenever my skin felt burnt and painful, then I put aquafor on top to keep moisture in. This combination worked well for me. I had xray once a week.
