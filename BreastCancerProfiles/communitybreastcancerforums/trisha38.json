What are the most common side affect and why ports instead of IV?? what decides that factor? Let me just say while im here a self breast exam saved my life.If i wasn't doing them it would have taken 2 yrs. brfore it would have been caught with a mammogram.I'll take any advice that i can get.                                  thanks, Trisha",
