If I needed to do it for my peace of mind he was on board.  I just don't know what I should do. I am already menopausal so I am not worried about those side effects but the other ones...like increase chance of heart disease and early onset of dementia.   My husband would like me to have them removed but has said he will support me either way.  I just don't want to trade in my \"peace of mind\" for other issues.

Jenwith4kids, Wow, that is a lot to think about in a short amount of time...  I am on Tamoxifen now but since they did the blood work to confirm where I am in menopause the gyno oncologist said I should stop taking it and switch to an AI. But I don't see the MO until Sept so I guess I will stay on it until he tells  me to switch.  I never liked the idea of taking it but after reading about the AI, I am not excited about those either.   Is anyone getting their tubes out too or just sticking with the ovaries?",

It started when my plastic Surgeon called today to get my Gyno Oncolgist number to set a surgery date..I almost said lets just do the reconstruction and worry about the ovaries later but I didn't and I haven't thought about anything else since.  They plan on doing both at the same surgery..I am menopausal  so my side effects would be less drastic than yours but I am worried about long term. Geez, I wish we didn't even have to think about this on top of everything else...I wish you luck on your decision.",

So frustrating... My BS wouldn't do it at time of BMX either, she said it was just to much at one time.  But said doing at the exchange surgery was possible. I just wonder since I am already menopausal if I will notice the side effects as much as someone who hasn't started yet...I have plenty of hot flashes now.",
