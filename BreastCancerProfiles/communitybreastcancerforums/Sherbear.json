Chemo affected my scar and made it tight so I kept up with the physio and doing some myself with an organic scar salve every day and radiation gave me a tiny bit of swelling which began to subside once I started my scar massage again (was told not to do it during rads).  This is only my experience though and I would definitely get some other opinions (from other docs too).  :)",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2011 08:48PM - edited Feb 1, 2011 08:50PM by Sherbear Hi there, shortly after my surgery I called up a specialty boutique near me to inquire about one and was told I had to wait 6-8 weeks post-surgery due to any swelling etc. as they want to get the fit as perfect as possible. I waited and then went in and was fitted for one, but I hardly wear it as I am small breasted and the smallest size is still too big and I don't like the shape of it.  Wish I would have shopped around a bit and I probably still will eventually to see if I can get one that feels right.  That's just me though, I'm sure a lot of women have had sucess with them.  You're right, they are expensive (especially for what they are!), but I was covered by my husbands work and the government (I'm Canadian).  Word of advice, make sure you're super happy with yours before you buy, I rushed into it and it's now useless to me as is the massive bra I purchased to go with it.  Right now, if I even wear a fake, it's a homemade one that looks more like my other breast shape-wise (it's so sad looking lol, basically a nude coloured  cup liner from a bathing suit or sport bra and some padding). I was told that you should wear one as your posture can suffer due to the weight removed, but for me, it's not as noticeable since I'm not larger there and there's really not all that much of a weight difference.  Also, I would think it more important for your core to be strong to support you.  Hope this helps you out! ",

I used a calendula oinment from the beginning and then was told to use Glaxal Base which I found almost useless and once I was really burned, I started applying a concentrated aloe lotion which has worked wonders.  Definitely keep your skin hydrated so that it hopefully doesn't crack or break.  Good luck!",

It feels strange when they're removed, didn't even feel the first one (on my chest) and took a couple extra strength tylenol about an hour before, but my 2nd one stung for 2 seconds coming through the incision hole which was smaller than the tube (forgot to take the tylenol).  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience getting them out and the others are so right, you are SO happy to have them out and be free of them!!!!!",
