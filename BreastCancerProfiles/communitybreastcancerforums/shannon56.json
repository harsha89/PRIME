Nadine - you are not alone with the zero libido.  Between DH's back and my cancer it's been a long time since any good sex.  Most men can wheather the storm and the ones that don't had issues of their own all along.  (Yes, I do know of one or two women who's hubby was not a DH and left them even before their surgery What creeps).",

Was totally exhausted all morning yesterday - probably because I did so much on Tuesday when I was feeling good.  I hope today is more level. Good luck to everyone having tx this week.",

      "Content": "May 1, 2009 01:16PM shannon56 wrote: tulipbebe - add me to the April list.  Started chemo on April 10 (TCH).  I opted for this 1.) I'm ER-/PR+ and TC is recommended for that 2.) HER2+ automatically required Herceptin 3.) my MIL had C for lung-cancer and I had alreday read every study there was on that particular poison 4.) Taxotere is less nasty than Taxol. I ask you all to be understanding for a minute as I need to vent.  I do understand all of your concerns and know your feelings to be real.  I wish people could/would understand my feelings.  Because my aunt had BC in the late 80's I was sort of prepared for the potential of BC but she wasn't considered a \"risk factor\" because she wasn't a first degree relative.  Also, one of my closest friend had BC in 2003 and while I never asked for her dx she talked alot about chemo, radiation and her reconstruction (the tummy thing). Thus when I found out that there was a good chance the lump in my breast was cancerous I basically said fine let's get rid of it.  At first I was pretty insistent on a masechtomy but my Doc said that lumpechtomy + radiation had as good a 5 yr survival rate as masechtomy alone.  When I went in 3 days later and had the dx confirmed I was insistent and unmovable (Taurus in me) on wanting chemo.  Since it turned out I had only one tumor not 2 separate ones I didn't have to fight for the chemo.  Yes I know I'm nuts and probably the only one here who looks forward to her chemo treatments.  Am I afraid? Yes, I am too young to die.  So the best thing to do is fight back.  I didn't inherit this -- my aunt was ILC and I was IDC.  I feel kind of out in the cold because I haven't seen anyone posting that has ER-/PR+ and HER2+.  This is supposedly the least found combo.  I have side effects but nearly as bad as most of you so I thank God every night (it will catch up to me one day). How do I cope like this?  I'm a recovering alcoholic.  There are no drugs to even put you into remission for that.  You have to learn to accept that you have a disease you don't want that has no medical cures and that the next sip of alcohol will probably kill you.  Thus I figure that if I've been sober for over 2 yrs I can deal with BC through prayer, meditation, and God.  I suggest anyone having a real hard time with acceptance read the book Alcholics Anonymous (sometimes called the Big Book.  The first 3 steps can help you with this very very scary road). Luckofthedraw -- last week (4/23) my neutrophil count was .19 but this week it rebounded to 4.7 and I was a very happy camper.  UPMC (Univ of Penn Med Ctr) has a wonderful section on the neutropenia diet.  I posted it on the refrig so I knew not just what I couldn't eat but what I could eat.  Also, if you are concerned about swine flu in your area, wear a mask and gloves (i have some lose woven work gloves from Home Depot) to every appointment, carry hand sanitizer with you at all times.  While hospitals are notorious for breeding infection you are much more likely to pick this up at the grocery store, hair salon, and places where many people who go there don't think a thing about personal hand and cough hygene or the transmission of disease. Sorry this was so long but I only get 5 posts a day so I have to make the most of them.  I sincerely hope I didn't offend anyone.  Everyone's feelings are important even when they're in the minority.",

Amy -- thanks for the sex info, at least if I don't feel like receiving I can give to my DH although I will double check with my onc tomorrow. DUTCHinAtlanta -- my aunt had the same problem as your wife back in the 80s.  I remembered how bad her arms were and asked for a port.  I am not having any problems with mine but I do know some have had issues here.  Since I'll be getting the herceptin for a year I just didn't want to have my own arm poked forever.",

Also, I've seen a lot of posts saying \"There's light at the end of the tunnel.\"  This always reminds me of the poet Robert Lovell -- \"The light at the end of the tunnel is the light of an on-coming train!\"  Far too often that is sooooo true.",

You should cry or do whatever comes naturally to you (ranting, throwing things) just be nice to your fiance when you aren't in emotional distress.",
