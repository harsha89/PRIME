      "Content": "nadinepouw wrote: Hi all, My mum had her 2nd FEC 3,5 weeks ago and a week later or so she developed quite bad backpain. When she went to her oncologist for the check-up before the 3rd FEC it also turned out her liver values were not ok (she didn't ask which values, so I don't have the specifics). The oncologist ordered an echo (ultrasound) of her liver (which she had yesterday, everything looked fine) and a bone scan (which she will be having today).  I wonder why the docter wanted to do those tests (something my mum also didn't ask. I need to join her with her next appointment). Did she expect metastasizes?????Or can you see an infection of the liver on an echo for example? Maybe she wanted to check for osteoporoses caused by the FEC? Despite the tests and the bad liver values my mum was allowed to have her 3rd FEC in the normal time schedule (once every 3 weeks), so probably the liver values were not too bad. Is there anyone who also experienced bad liver values and/or very bad backpains (not able to sit down or walk properly) after FEC?  And does anyone know why they do an ultrasound of the liver and a bone scan when these se's appear? Thanks a lot in advance for your help. I wish all of you strenght with your battle. love, Nadine Mum: ILC stage II, 2.2cm, ER+PR+ HER2-, 1/19 nodes Log in to post a reply",
