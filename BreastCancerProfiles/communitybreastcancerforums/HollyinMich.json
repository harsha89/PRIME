ReadingMama, I am also on Herceptin every 3 weeks.  Well ladies, speaking of appointments, I need to get ready to meet with the lympedema PT.  My first meeting and while I haven't had a problem with it yet I'm hoping to get ahead of the curve on it and get a sleeve ordered just in case.  I only had 8 nodes out but they are zapping the hell out of my axillary and my subclavian nodes.  I'd rather be prepared and proactive than reactive to it if it should occur!",

ReadingMama - I would ask your rad onco about the LE.  He should be able to refer you to a PT and write you a script for the sleeve and glove or gauntlet.  I was going to go ahead and just take my script in and get fitted today but I figured I'd hold off until after my appointment this afternoon. Gymnut - Of course it's ok if you post here!  Welcome to the thread!  Sorry to hear your rads got off to a rough start but glad to see that things are looking better for you!",

Sagina - Good luck on Thursday!  As far as what to wear, it really doesn't matter much from the waist up.  You change into a gown before tx and just leave everything from the waist down on.  My techs are pretty good about trying to keep everything covered that doesn't need to be exposed for the zaps. AimeeMac - Same here.  15 min drive to the treatment center.  So thankful I don't have a long drive too! Christine - Welcome to the thread!  I noticed the ache too right away.  For me, though, I start feeling it right after my tx, but it's usually gone by the time I head to bed.

I haven't noticed too much swelling as of yet.  I had a little bit this morning because idiot me took a really hot bath to help with the body aches I'm getting now almost 2 months out from Taxol.  Uggh, got to love those late SE's.  I didn't think about it and stuck part of my arm in the water for a few minutes before it dawned on me.  So I had a little tightness from a bit of swelling in my upper arm but it's disapated now thank goodness!!",

You are doing the right thing by having it checked!  Be persistant, don't let doctors blow you off because of your age and if you notice any changes in the lump report them to your doctor immediately!  I wish you all the best of luck and truly hope that it IS nothing. ",

So happy to hear that you also had a complete response too! ProudMom_Wife - Thank you so much for the compliment. That was indeed the purpose of starting this thread. With so many threads dedicated to the SEs of chemo, I thought it would be nice to have one that helps to show the light at the end of the tunnel. Some of the treatments are harder than others and if you are one of the unlucky ones that gets hit hard with the SEs it's nice to know that it pays off in the end! Hillck - So happy to hear that you also had a complete response and that you bounced back so quickly from the chemo! InTwoPlaces - I hope it has for you too!! That was the nice part of having the neoadjuvant treatment was actually being able to see the difference. I certainly have faith that it did do some good for you. I have the same feeling about radiation now. It's hard when you can't physically know for sure that it's doing something other than burning your skin, but I just have to keep the faith and know that I am doing everything possible to help prevent a reoccurrence. Thank you ladies for sharing your stories!! ",

Combine that with a recent cancer diagnosis that already has you terrified and you can become overwhelmed very easily. Everyone's situation is different and therefore the options presented to you are also different. Someone with Stage I may have no need for chemo. Whereas, someone who is Stage II may be advised to undergo chemo but is given more as an option to reduce reoccurrence as opposed to someone with Stage III that is told it is a necessity. With that having been said, I chose to start this thread to shed a positive light on the good chemotherapy can do. I'd like to see all the ladies that have completed chemotherapy share their stories as to how it has impacted their outcome in this fight for our lives. I hope that if these stories are compiled in one thread it will help someone in their own journey and decision making process and eliminate the need to wade through all of the numerous threads on this site, which can be a daunting task all on its own especially when newly diagnosed.  I apologize in advance if this has been done before, but I have not seen a thread like this and thought it could be useful. This thread is NOT the place to chastise anyone's choice to undergo chemo, but rather share our stories. If you can't be nice then feel free to voice your opinions elsewhere.

Your boyfriend sounds like a selfish a$$!  And after having the great experience of being lucky enough to find a TRUE man it makes me so mad for you!  I hope things start looking up for you soon!  I know how hard it is to try and remain strong.  I hope you have family close by that you can lean on for help.  Research the internet for organizations that might be able to help you financially and talk to the Social Worker at your hospital  They can refer you and help you find the financial help that you need. Also, keep in mind that while chemo does suck it's not as bad as it used to be and it's certainly not as bad as Hollywood like to make it out.  We all experience it differently so no one can say for sure that you won't have this side effect or that you will have another.  I know it's scary, but it is doable!  And your oncologist will help you to manage your side effects so make sure you talk to him/her about any that you experience.  The oncology nurses are always a great resource too.  They have seen it all and they will be able to offer you a lot of support.",

My biopsy showed angiolymphatic invasion, grade 3 tumor, HER2 positive ER/PR negative. I had axillary lymph node involvement that was palpable and visible in mammogram, CT and PET scans. No sentinel node biopsy was performed because the scans were all positive for involvement. I immediately began dose dense A/C the day after I met with my oncologist and had discussed my biopsy pathology reports with him. I had 4 rounds of DD A/C that I received every two weeks followed by 12 weeks of weekly Taxol and Herceptin that I finished on January 19, 2011. I am now currently on Herceptin every three week through January of 2012. Since I began chemotherapy as neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) I was able to visibly see and feel the difference the chemo was making. After the very first infusion my very swollen and red breast began to reduce in size and the redness began to turn brownish kind of like tanned skin. After tx #2 the redness was completely gone and the swelling gone as well. I had two IDC tumors in my breast. The smaller second tumor I completely lost track of during A/C. The large 4.8 cm primary tumor shrunk steadily and consistently throughout treatment. I had a bilateral mastectomy on February 18, 2011. Left prophylactic mx and right mrm with right axillary node dissection that resulted in 8 nodes removed. Post surgical pathology reports showed a COMPLETE RESPONSE to chemotherapy. No residual cancer cells remained in the primary tumor site, the secondary tumor was completely gone and no residual cancer cells in the axillary lymph nodes. My oncologist was bursting at the seams with the good news. I am currently undergoing radiation therapy. Even with the complete response to chemo, IBC has an extremely high rate of reoccurrence coupled with additional rate of reoccurrence due to my Her2 status. Radiation further reduces my risk of reoccurrence by 50%. The five months of chemotherapy were hell on my body but well worth the outcome. Having one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of breast cancer, chemo has given me the hope that I'll still be here to see my 8 year old daughter become a young woman, go on her first date, learn to drive, graduate high school, go to college and hopefully I'll still be here to see her get married and start a family of her own! I don't regret one minute of my chemo.",

As far as bathing goes, lol, I've thought about that issue as well and still haven't come up with a good resolution.  I'm hoping that I can find a cheap handheld shower that will attach to the faucet so that we don't have to do a complete showerhead replacement.  Thankfully, I still don't have much hair yet since I just finished chemo.  The peachfuzz is still easily taken care of with a wash cloth.  XD",

I did have a decrease in the ejection fraction rate of my heart but I'm not entirely sure it was the Herceptin.  It could have been from the A/C.  It has come back up on it's own and I'm still on Herceptin so that leads me to believe it could have been from the dd A/C.  Other that I have some achey joints, but I think that has more to do with the overall lasting effects from chemo, not any one particular treatment in general. The worst side effects for me on the Taxol/Herceptin came from the pre-meds.  They gave me infusions of Benedryl and Decadron prior to Taxol to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.  The Benedryl would give me a wicked case of restless legs and itchy crawly skin for a couple hours.  I was one of the lucky few who had this reaction, it's not common.  The Decadron is a corticosteroid.  It caused me to have a lot of insomnia, which by the end had worn on me pretty badly.  Again, though, not everyone experiences the effects I had to the degree I did.  You can ask after the first couple of infusions (once the know you're not going to have an allergic reaction) for them to lower the dose a bit if it's causing you problems.  It helps sometimes too if they lower the infusion rate and do it a bit slower for the premeds. Hopefully that answers some of your questions.  Good luck and hoping that you breeze through it!! ",

The xanax really came in handy for the tests like the MRI and PET to help relax me for them and to just cope in the begining. Best of wishes to you, Maggie and sending lots of prayers your way! ",
