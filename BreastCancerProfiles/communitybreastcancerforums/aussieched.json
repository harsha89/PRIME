I go in with a long list of questions, but end up only asking the most pressing ones, as I feel a bit intimidated.  On the other hand, when I see my radio oncologist, (whom I alternate between them both every six months), I feel really at ease with and I have not hesitation in asking questions. As others have mentioned above, I think this would be a great new thread to start and we could all post information in, after we do our Onc visits. ched I",

I reacted very badly to the radiation.  Had 21 rounds, but skin became read and very inflamed by the 2nd round.  By the end of the 21 rounds, my skin was dark purple, and all the skin melted off and was bleeding and weeping, and it took about 6 weeks to heal.  4 Years later I ended up in hospital with a serious bout of cellulitis over left breast shoulder and down arm.  At the time I found 3 very tiny red marks about the size of  pin heads under my armpit.  Turned out to be the start of lmyphangoma circumscriptum, which is a disease caused by the combination of radiation and the number of nodes taken out.  I am now left with a terrible condition, for which there is no cure.  The area has now grown to be approximately the size of the diameter of a tea cup, and is very uncomfortable, painful and the lumps weep lymph fluid.  I have also found out that this condition can turn to angiosarcoma which is a very aggressive cancer. I have had the area burnt off, but the lumps started growing back again with a week. So as you can imagine, I am not impressed with my current condition, and never thought for one minute when I signed the waiver put under my nose by the radiation oncologist, that I would be one of the people to end up with another disease caused from the result of my treatment.

I now believe I did not have the most aggressive treatment being the chemo, and had the ovaries out instead.  I had not started menopause, was aged 52 at the time, and am currently on Femara.My doctor really didn't prepare me for the horrendous side affects I have experienced the last 3 years. From the time I woke up from the surgery (key hole) I have experienced massive hot flushes, some times up to 100+ times a day.  In the early period straight after surgery, I also experienced shaking, and shivers, and I swung between them and the hot flushes.  I do however believe that the Femara could also be contributing to the ongoing problems I have been having, as you read on many sites all the problems that femara can cause, and that is without having had the ovaries out for most women, so it is hard to say how much of the problems are contributed to the loss of the ovaries.  It is now 3 years since the ovaries went, and my hair has thinned dramatically, and I am to the point, that I will probably be hairless (on the head) by another 6 months.  Lots of muscle and bone pain, depression, loss of libido, and with every dexa bone density, the density if dropping. I also have trouble sleeping, and normally only have about 2-3 hours per night, and the hot sweats are always worse at night. I now have high blood pressure, and high cholestoral, which I never had before, (however this could be a Femara thing), have tendonitis of both wrists and now need to strap my wrists so I can continue to work full time clerical.  I do find your Doctor's comment that you will have the ovaries out and then have HRT rather strange, because I was 80% er and pr, and the whole reason that I had the ovaries out was to lower my estrogen level which was driving the cancer, and then the Femara is mopping up any other estrogen left that is made by the adrenal system, and the fact that you have had er breast cancer would only be fueling it again?  But then again, they are the experts, so they should know all the answers. However, don't let me put you off having your ovaries out, if that is what is needed, let's face it, if this keeps the breast cancer away for me, I will be more than glad to put up with all the side affects.  I guess it just really gets me down at times.  You will read on the net that women who have their ovaries taken out early, have a shortened life, as stats show higher risk of heart disease, stroke etc, etc.  The doctors now believe the ovaries are there for a reason and increase our longevity, but I guess in my case, the breast cancer is a bigger threat, and could kill me first, so I will just have to take the risk that I could die of heart disease sooner, if the breast cancer doesn't get me first.  Good luck in your decision ",

I can't see on your bio if you had radiation, however it would appear that you didn't, so it may not be what I have been warned about by my medical team. I had major complications with radiation and having had 30 glands out. About 3 years after the treatment I developed lymphangioma circumscriptum, a result of developing lymphadema after the treatment. The oncologist has warned me to be aware, and check the area regularly and if I see a bruise, it could be an indication of another cancer, not breast cancer, but another serious type of cancer, which I won't go into here, as I don't want to concern you. Please keep asking the doctors, until you get an answer. regards Ched   ",

Sounds like your problem is different to what I have, where it would appear your main symptom/problem is the lymphadema which is causing swelling of your arm and hand which can be assisted by specially trained lymphadema therapists. I would suggest that you see the person you are booked in to see (and it may take many appointments with that person before you gain control of the swelling) and before you might start to see an improvement. If this treatment does not help, you could always then see a lymphadema specialist at Macquarie University hospital who may be able to provide different treatment to assist with the lymphadema.

With regards to Healthscope Pathology, I note that they have only started the Oncotype testing service since beginning 2009, but I believe the samples still have to be sent to the United States for testing, and it often takes quite a long time to get the results back, so therefore a lot of doctors in Australia are not using it at this stage, because they want to get on with the treatment as quickly as possible. It would be great for all the ladies who are now being diagnosed if they could have access to this test, as it would really make the decision on what treatment to do a lot easier.  Thanks for your reply ",

I was interested to read your post re positive for micromet and no chemo. I had my treatment back in 2007 and still lurk here on the boards to read the latest.  At that time I was told I had an option of either chemo (because of the micromet) or have an oophorectomy.  At the time I was advised the oophorectomy was a good option for my grade 1, stage 11a cancer.  I had already had a lumpectomy (micromet of 1mm in sentinal node) then followed up with auxillary clearnance, with a total of 30 glands taken out, and yes, I now have lymphedema and have suffered 3 bouts of cellulitis in the last 4 months. Hospitalised on drip for one of the bouts. In hindsight I have always worried about not doing the chemo, as it seems most ladies with at least 1 positive gland do chemo.  Being in Australia (4 years ago) we did not have access to the oncotype test.  Even though I did not do the oncotype test, your post about not having chemo at least gives me some hope now. regards Aussieched",

At the time I did not have the time to research and was guided by my doctor, however now I am feeling totally sick to the stomach, as the more I read, it would appear that chemo should have been undertaken.  The sentinal node was positive and I had a total of 30 glands removed, so as you can imagine, ended up with lymphodema within 24 hours of my second surgery and continuing.  Had 3 surgeries in total over a 3 week period.  Am currently taking Femara, however that combined with no ovaries, I have been really suffering for 3 years with every side affect listed on the Femara packet.  If there are any women who did not have chemo, and are still travelling well, I would appreciate hearing from you, as I really need a bit of good news to cheer me up.  I have found the depression during the last few months hard to take, especially when I am reading that I probably did not take the best option for treatment.  You ladies in America are lucky to be able to undertake the Oncotype test, we don't have that available to us here in Australia, and are flying blind in that regard, and rely on our medical specialists to advise us what to do.",

They normally keep you on the table while the pathology is done on the sentinal node (they cut it through into 2 pieces to check the middle).  If they find anything sinister, they then continue with the axillary clearance, in the one op,  In my case after the op, the surgeon said all looked good, however they would not be certain until all the pathology came back on it 1 week later.  Well one week later I got the great news that they had found malignancy on the outside of the sentinal node, and didn't get clear margins for the lumpectomy, so back I had to go and have further tissue taken out, plus a full axillary clearance with a total of 30 nodes taken. It turned out that the sentinal node was the only positive one, however it was then decided for me to then have an oophorectomy so I then went back in for the 3rd surgery the following week.  I don't think my surgeon is money hungry at all, and actually for the 3rd surgery told me he would only bill me for the amount I would be able to claim back through our health care system, so making money certainly wasn't his aim with me.  Unfortunately these sorts of things happend some time, and I do know a few women who have had a similiar experience to me.

I wish it had of been, as I often wonder whether I have made the right decision. I was offered chemo then hormonal treatment OR have my ovaries out/or have lupron, and then hormonal treatment. The oncologist felt that the amount of benefit from the chemo would have been very minimal and thought having the ovaries out and the hormonal treatment was a better option for me. I opted for having my ovaries out, and am currently still on Femara for over 7 years. At this stage I am still going OK, however if I knew what my recurrence risk was, it would make it easier for me to decide whether to keep taking the hormonal treatment or stop now. I have so many problems from the 7 years of Femara, I would like to stop, but am too frightened to. Ched  ",

After the surgery I was initially told the sentinal node was good, however a week later more pathology came back to say the node was positive.  As they did not get clear margins plus positive sentinal node, I went back for more surgery and had a total of 30 nodes taken out plus to get clear margins. That was 3 years ago, and from a lot of information I have read recently, some doctors are now opting not to do auxillary clearance of nodes as stats are  apparently saying that it does not appear to give us any better outcomes with the auxillary clearance, plus it can also start the lymphadema problems which I do have.  I believe they are saying that the chemo will sort out any problems without taking further nodes.  I believe the auxillary clearance was just another tool for them to work out your staging. Try not to worry too much, I know the waiting is the worst, however I am sure your onc will sort it all out for you. ched",

Unfortunately I did not have the luxury of Oncotype to help me.  We did not have that available to us in Australia, so basically had to go with the information my doctor provided me.  I also had a micro met on the outside of my sentinal node after originally being told after the surgery that all was clear.  It was such a bummer. I than had to have auxillary clearace, with a total of 30 nodes being taken, and now have lymphedema.  Fortunately the other 29 were clear. My cancer was 80% ER and 80% PR. I ended up having an oophorectomy and radiation, but on evidence provided, did not have the chemo.  I still worry every day now, that I did not do the chemo.  In hindsight, after reading all the postings here, I sometimes wish I had done the chemo for that extra insurance.  However my medical team felt what I had done was fine, and basically they were also concerned about all the side affects of chemo, and the long term medical issues is can at times, cause.  At the time I was rushed to make a decision in 5 minutes, as I live 500 klms from my treating hospital, so had to make my mind up there and thenand not able to go home and do some research, I am now on the aromatase inhibitor Femara, for 5 years at least, and so far so good.  From all that I have read it seems that the chemo seems to be more beneficial for the faster growing type cancers, and not the Grade 1 type, however I have also read that chemo can also be slightly beneficial for the slow growing type also.  So it basically comes back to whether you want to take the chance of permanent side affects from the chemo.  I don't think it happens that often, however it does happen. Lucky for you that you are already in the medical profession, and I am sure you will have surrounded yourself with the best team to help you make that decision. best wishes ched I",

When I went back a week later to get the full pathology report, I was advised that they found a 1mm micrometasasis on the outside of the sentinal node, and I was then told I would have to return to have an axillary clearance, which I did. A further 29 nodes were taken out and all were clear. I was told a good solution for me would be to then have my ovaries removed, instead of CMF chemo,which I did a week later. as I was 52 and had not started menopause. My IDC was 80% estrogen & 80% progestorone. At the time we did not have the oncotype available to us in Australia, so I was flying blind as to what to do, and basically followed the advice of my doctors. I developed lympodema straight away after the axillary clearance and continue to have huge problems with it. I have now developed lymphangoma circumscriptum in the axilla and I have been told it is a direct result of the axillary clearance (30 nodes in total) plus radiation on top, and the resultant lymphodema. I have also now been advised that this could turn to angioscaroma at some time in the future. So I am totally bummed by the whole outcome of the surgeries. I followed up the 3 surgeries with radiation, and am now just about finished my 6th year of AI, Femara. Ched",
