Sherry, if I can get through FEC without nausea, thanks to many different meds, your onc can find something to work for you.  I know Ativan (lorazepam) is addicting, but if you need it, take it!  When you have good days or the chemo is over, you will not want it then.  It helps with anxiety, nausea, and generally makes chemo more tolerable. I discussed the addiction aspect with my husband, and we agreed I should take as much as I need on the bad days and not take it on the good days.  We suffer enough!

My nurses put the cold gel mitts on my feet and hands.  Jeez, I am not worring about mets to my fingers and toes....... DMom, I have lost all hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes.  I too am getting very long peach fuzz on my cheeks.  It's not great but seeing as it is the only hair I have, I guess I'll keep it for now. Northern Girl, hang in there.  We all know someone who has passed from breast cancer.  It is very sad but doesn't mean it's going to be our story ending.  Keep fighting girl! I did see a bald realtor stuck in the sand pit on the way home, but she looked so scary I didn't stop to help........ Love and Hugs, Mimi ",

JFV  Try GEL BANDAIDE brand bandaids.  They heal well, keep infection away, and stay on through water and showers.  Expensive but very worth it. You can leave them in place for 3 days.  I always use them for cuts on fingers. Vicky, I am proud of you for finnishing.  I was up all night on steroids.

I grew up in KC.KS before moving to Canada.  I love hearing about your trips there.  I miss home so much, my sister still lives there. I went in to work to resign my nursing teaching job at the university as I just can't do clinical teaching anymore with the compression glove on and not being able to wash my hands 25 times a day.  My boss did not want me to quit and they will change my duties just to keep me.  Made me feel valued.  I will start back just 2 mornings a week at the end of the month.  I didn't even think about what standing on my feet for 8 hrs a day would do to the neuropathy on my feet. Lizzyanne, I know what you mean about 60.  I wasn't looking forward to it in May, but now I am just grateful to think I will make it. Love and Hugs, Mimi",

I went thru menopause 7 years ago so knocking out the rest of the estrogen was not a big deal to me.  I think it is much different for premenopause women as it makes a drastic change for them. Hang in there, you will make the right decision for yourself. My hubby and I now get up and shave together everymorning. Such a romantic thing............. Sherry, that's great news, you are hungry and gaining weight!  Except for the joints, can I stop worrying about you all the time? You have had a very rough road with this treatment. I am so glad you are doing better. Chey, It is good to have a place to feel safe.  The other women on this board are so fantastic.  Just don't phone Bon to talk, she will just fall asleep on you.

That is an improvement as I only say him for 5 mins. the first time.  Mostly his student resident did everything. Good luck with the new meds this week, I wish you no S/E.

Bon, I can identify with how worried you are.  I hope you obtain some relief with the prednisone. I am headed off to the hospital today.  After a weeks delay because of the gut infection, they will do bloodwork, an EKG and MUGA scan to check for heart damage.  My pulse has been running very high and I am winded all the time.  If all is ok, I will have the LAST FEC tomorrow.  I really hope everything is ok and I can do this last yucky triple chemo and move on to the taxol.  More later.

I had an emergency appt at the lymphedema clinic and now am bandaged from fingers to shoulder.  It felt so good to have it massaged and hopefully clear the extra fluid.  I have 2 more appts at the end of the month to learn self wrapping too.  21 down, 4 more plus 5 boosts.  My skin is looking like fried bacon but it hasn't (hope hope) broken down yet.

Congrats to everyone who finnished or is near finnishing.  It feels good to be done.  The fatigue lingers and chemo brain still evident.  I have delayed going back to work until Feb. 15, and that will be part time for the first six weeks.  I'm not sure I'll be ready but feel pressure from the insurance company to return as soon as possible. It is so cold and snowy here in Manitoba.  The side of the driveway is so high you can not shovel any more snow up there! (not that I do the driveway clearing) Love and Hugs to everyone, Mimi",

Kitty cat, my hair is only 1\\4 to1\\2 inch long even tho I finnished last chemo Sept. 17th.  Still mostly bald at the top with just stubble coming in.  I am so disappointed with this.  Is anyone having bad chemo brain?  I still do things like put the dogs outside in -30 C temps and forget about them for 30 minutes. My memory and concentration are just trashed and I really worry about going back to work in a high stress situation and trying to multitask.  It just doesn't happen and I will look stupid. Love and Hugs, Mimi",

Julia 2, I've been having several of those fear days too.  Just knowing all you gals are here and understand really helps me get through.  My Dr. keeps suggesting antidepressants.  I have \"toughed it out\"until now but I wonder if they would help.  Have others found them helpful? Chey, Did you get to the Dr. about your concern?  I am thinking about you and your sister and hoping for the best. DMom, love the attitude! Love and Hugs, Mimi",

Joan, could I join you on the couch? Yum, I love those cookies. Latte, If we were rich, a few of us could fly to Isreal and babysit during your surgery.  Wish we could baby you too during your recovery! Bon, you have such a way with words and are able to really express your understanding and empathy of how others feel. Such a wonderful skill. Kittycat, great idea to take a vacation instead of surgery.  Go for it! Jackie I read where the months following the completion of active treatment are the most difficult.  There is so much physical and emotional healing to do, along with the dreaded fear of reoccurance it is little wonder we all are't somewhat mad by now.  Do not hit the delete button.  Sharing your feelings really helps us realize we are not alone in what we are going thru. I saw my onc twice.  Once before chemo and once after radiation to get a script for femara.  He is young, good looking, a charmer and I think a real twit.  He says no follow up, no bloodwork, no tests.  Geez!  I saw my family doctor today and she did a complete physical and ordered lots of bloodwork, a bone density, mammogram, and yes a colonoscopy. I also will start a low dose of antidepressant.  I figure it can't hurt and might help.  I think I prefer to see my Dr. instead of the onc anyway, she is much more thourough. Oh yeah, she found a \"freckle\"on my private parts.  She said \"we don't like freckles\"  so more tests.  Oh well, after BC, not much scares me now. Love and Hugs to all, Mimi",

Gin2ca, isn't the lymphedema wrapping fun?  It gets easier with time but your arm feels like an elephants leg....  I wouldn't worry about cancer cells being moved.  They don't do massage on anybody in active treatment for that reason. Chilli, congrats on the biopsy results.  That must have been a relief. Kitty, congrats on the MRI and NED. Jackie, I will be thinking about you on the 19th.  I hope it goes well with an uneventful recovery. Have you chosen your dress for the wedding yet? Bon, loved the pearl info.  I liked the tear drops from the moon.  Your picture is great.  I would buy a house from you.  Hope your MUGA is good and the cough improving. Just got back from the Dr. and my breast cancer tumor markers are normal, not elevated any more.  I have a mammogram on Friday too.  It is the first time in a year that I can finally allow myself to think I am cancer free for now. Doing the happy dance today.  Time to go buy a string of pearls I believe. Love to you all, Mimi",

Living is a small town in Canada, I'm not sure if it's possible to join some of the clinical trials happening in the states right now.  Hope to get to know you all better.",
