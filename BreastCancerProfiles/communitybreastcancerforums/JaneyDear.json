Now, I find myself in a quandary over treatment options, and I've seen how helpful this community has been for others, and I hope this community can help me with a big decision. I was diagnosed with liver mets (Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer) last February. I had previously had Breast Cancer, and Kidney Cancer in 2006 (No chemo/radiation, just nephrectomy/mastectomy).  My current oncologist (at Joseph Brant/Juravinski) put me on FAC last February. Week one FAC, week two 5 FU, and week three off. When I stopped treatment, the \"innumerable\" little tumors had disappeared, and the four big ones had shrunk, leaving three smaller ones. I went on Tamoxifen for 6 months, but the tumors started growing again. This February she put me back on FAC hoping to blast them to smithereens. However, I went to get a second opinion at Sunnybrook (which has a specialized Breast Cancer Clinic) in Toronto. The oncologist at this hospital was in complete disagreement with my current treatment, and wants to treat the cancer more like a chronic condition, taking me off the FAC, and putting me on Taxol. She thinks FAC is too harsh, especially since it's only been six months since the first protocol of 6 rounds.  Now...I'm in completely confused, and so overwhelmed with having to make a choice. And so afraid of making the wrong choice. Anyone out there with liver mets, or other mets, able to offer some insight? Thanks!

I'll keep you posted, but you've confirmed my gut instinct that Sunnybrook's treatment plan is better.  I wish you all success with your treatments. And Krystyna - I hope your next protocol is the magic combo! Pet junkie - that's amazing!  God Bless!",

Spiceypetunia - I'm sorry to hear about the brain mets. My advice? Don't confuse a pity party with support. News like that is like a punch to the gut - just knocks you back. I completely understand the brave face, and the soldiering on attitude, but sometimes you just need to stop, breathe, and accept support, love, hugs, and care, (and cookies!). Sometimes strength comes from others, and gives you fighting spirit. RonnieKay, and and Debbie/Chichimaine - wow! That's amazing. So glad to hear you both had such success with Navelbine! I really hope that Navelbine does the same for me. My doctor agreed (though I haven't seen her again yet!), and I am three weeks on, one week off. I am currently going into week three. When I see her next, I am going to push for a biopsy - my spidey sense tells me that the cancer beast that lives within my liver has changed its spots. I am just taking it in baby steps. Not beating myself up for being tired - thinking positively that my tumor load will decrease, decrease, decrease... Sending you all healing light, and prayers. Jane ",

Both Halaven, and Xeloda failed for me. I just stopped Halaven, because the tumours in my liver have grown again. This is the first time my liver function is not in the normal range. I may not be my former pre-mets self, but I still feel I have fight in me. My onc now seems to be trying to push, \"the talk\" on me, and when I pushed back (gently, yet forcefully) she threw around maybe Navelbine, it would be \"the only chemo left\", or maybe a few trials, but my now slightly struggling liver, might count me out for those. I was a little shocked. It used to be a \"bag of tricks\", and she has never suggested another biopsy so see if my status has flipped either. I read on these threads of many, many chemos that our mets sisters go through, and often they will find a new one that works for them. I certainly haven't tried ALL of them. I feel kind of defeated, and silly for still wanting to have hope, and wanting to fight. Looking for any advice if anyone of you who have experienced this as well. I see such inspiration, and hope in these threads, that I feel I have a right to keep fighting as well. Just frustrated with the system. Thank you!",

Though - I don't pop up quite as fast now, more like in slow motion. I just wish I'd stop being punched - like this week when my WBC was too low to get my third round of Navelbine for my first cycle. Hopefully it will be back up soon. Has anyone else had issues with their WBC? This is, believe it or not after all the chemo I've had, the first time my WBC was too low. Healing light, and prayers!

Isy, JFL, and Woodylb, thank you for your advice - I will request a new biopsy. I would rather know, than wonder. Thank you for the encouragement. Woodylb - oh, that is wonderful to hear. A miracle indeed! I am so happy for you. apackoftwo - I am so happy that Navelbine is working so well for you! My liver tumors have done the same thing, and to have such results would be just amazing. Your success with this drug gives me fuel for my fight. I am happy to hear it is a tolerable chemo - my onc seems to think it isn't - but heck, the SE list doesn't seem half as scary as some of the others I've experienced! I wish you continued success on this drug. And I will ask about immunology studies. Thank you ladies, and blessings to all. You've renewed my strength, and I am determined to make use of all the treatments options available! I will keep you informed. ",
