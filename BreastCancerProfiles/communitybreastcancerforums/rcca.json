I had no nausea, but did have bone/muscle pain. I took ativan the first two nights after treatment so I could sleep. The first treatment was the worst, but I was so happy that I could actually read a book, I didn't care. I had some tingling/pain in my hands and feet but it went away. I am three weeks PFC and am still tired and have stared radiation. I don't have my appetite back and food still doesn't taste great. I lost my lower eyelashes and my upper eyelashes have thinned, so I really look like a cancer patient (thanks to my son for pointing that out). Eyeliner does help. My eyebrows have also thinned, but it is easy enough to fill them in. I can feel hair growing on my head, but it is not really visible. Wishing you the mildest/fewest side effects. RCCA",

I just didn't seem to have the energy to post. The one time I typed a long post I lost it and just couldn't try again. Any yesterday was my last chemo (4 DD AC followed by 4 DD Taxol).  Off to my Nuelesta shot soon (Yuck).  I had my rads consultation a weeks ago and will be doing 16 treatments (that's the shorter Canadian protocol with the same amount of radation over fewer days). My onc said it has the same results. There is a slight chance of more side effects, but I want this to be over! Yesterday before chemo I had my rad setup and tatoos.  I had two-one on the side and one in the middle (it is pretty low and will not show with 98% of my wardrobe), but looks like a blackhead and not a freckle). Maybe it fade. I still have my simulation and my frist treatment will be Sept 2. After my rads are complete the plan is for Arimidex daily and zometa infusion twice a year. I wish all of you the best on this journey! RCCA",
