      "Content": "MomtoIrishQuads wrote: Hello all, I just had my first chemo on Wed. and I seriously have never felt worse in my life.  (and I've been through a lot).  I was surprised with the effect on my body and am thinking that I don't want to continue with the other 3 treatments.  (TC x 4). I'm doing it because my oncatype was in the middle range (21) and this is my second diagnosis (first one was 3 years ago and was Stage 0 in a different breast).  Tonight I'm reading the posts (which I wish I would have earlier) - about how chemo is most effective with fast growing cells - and I don't even know if mine are...ughhh.  I know that it was Stage 1, Grade 3, 1.9 cm (upgraded after surgery from 2 to 3) and that it is almost all estrogen driven (97%) as was the last go around.  I didn't do Tamoxifen last time - partial mastectomy and radiation. My oncologist here in SC said that chemo was totally my decision (oh boy - like I know more than she does???).  I called my former oncologist in CA who told me to absolutely do TC chemo since this is my second time around and who knows how long I'll be able to tolerate hormone pills (the A one). This is so darned confusing - but I do know that I feel like death warmed over - and was really quite afraid over the last few days from the side effects.  Body aches beyond belief - sweats, heart pals - mouth sores.  Seems like a lot to do as an \"insurance policy\" from hormone pills.  This can't be good for the body. What happens if you pull out of chemo after one session?  Any harm in that?  I'm not sure that I'm up for this if it's just a safety net.

I asked her about cold caps and she told me that they don't work so don't bother.  No discussion of side effects. 4)  Went in for labs on July 9.  Got TC infusion.  Asked the nurse about getting a Vitamin D level done with my labs and was told that wasn't standard so they wouldn't do it (huh?).  Starting on Day 2 - had a miserable 5 days of every side effect possible.  No one called to follow-up with me to see how I was doing (is that common?).  I finally called after a day and talked to a triage nurse who gave me some tips and script for magic mouthwash.  No phone call from a doctor.  Here I am nearly a week later - still having side effects and no follow-up phone call.   Just wondering if this is fairly typical.  No discussion of side effects - no opinion about treatment.  I'm feeling like I'm in a sub-par facility and not feeling well taken care of - but wanted all of your opinions before I yell.
