There are so many unknowns and questions going through your mind.  As the appointments keep coming and as questions are answered the anxiety will probably lift a little. I have three young children as well (8, 6, and 4 currently) and was diagnosed two years ago in Feburary. My children, I feel, made it so much worse because I was worried for them and how they will cope with my treatment and of course you think \"what if the worst\"? Treatments have came a long way and your chances of being ok are much better than not. I found myself not sleeping and crying spontaneously! I couldn't keep put mind anywhere else, it was torture. I promise you will find a new normal and will settle into it slowly. I talked with my onc and he helped me sleep with a RX of ambien and Ativan for anxiety.  These two meds helped ease my mind tremendously to sleep better and go to appointments without so much fear! Don't be stubborn and try to be too tough, your only human. Things get worse if your tired and freaked out all day long:) you can PM me too if you need. Take care of yourself!!!!! It will get better!",

Surgery and radiation cannot do this.  I have a lot of years left for little things to pop up and that is my best chance of warding it off. Cascam, I am gonna have to brush up on my abbreviations I see:) I am fairly new to this site and all these abbreviations!  Not so new to breast cancer anymore. I have no idea what peri neural is??? Can you explain?  Yes, I can understand chemo and rads first.  I did chemo, masectomy, then rads. Rads should probably come after surg. If they are on same tissues, because healing can be rough on irradiated tissues, but that is for you and your onc to figure out.  As my surg explained \"no one dies of breast cancer in the breast, it is dangerous when it gets out into other organs of the body\" so they want to treat body first and foremost in a lot of cases these days.  They probably have reason to be at least a little concerned about that or it can be your age.  I think they jump to chemo on young people to decrease chance of it recurring in the next 40 years.  Very curious about peri neural.",

It has been just over two years since I was in your shoes and my heart still jumps if I get a call from my oncologist office. It does get easier though. Answers to your questions will alleviate a lot of tension and as you get a plan developed it will help tremendously. Be honest with your team of doctors about your anxieties. They see it all and can give you options for help with sleep and anxiety. You need sleep to keep your yourself sane! I could go on and on because I especially hate the first few weeks, they are are soooo tough mentally. You will cry at the drop of a hat and dwell on the unthinkable and how it will effect your family members. You will loose sleep and cry somemore.  It will get easier!! You will get treatment, which is scary. It can be done and you are not alone. I have three girl, ages 4, 6 & 8. You will gain strength from your daughter to fight as hard as possible and kids and work are a great distraction and keep you moving. Best of luck to you!",

I had three tumors  ranging from .5cm to1.6cm with a positive micromet with the sentinel node biopsie and a positive node when five more were taken later.  But with original PET scan there was always a spot on my ilium that was about 5mm. It lit up with every PET scan for the next two years and my onc always said it was too small and difficult to biopsie there.  Then it grew 3mm in my last PET in Nov. 2013. We decided to try to biopsie it at that point and it was confirmed as breast cancer to my bone, so in reality it was there the whole time, just not diagnosed.  My husband was upset about it not being treated, but i have since had it treated with radiation and discussed this with my onc and surg and I feel they chose to ignore it to a point so I could get the chemo and surgery I needed. If you come out of the box a stage four you can run into insurance problems because you are considered incurable and therefore subject to the possibility of denied treatment. There is no way most people can afford all those treatments on there own!  They said I deserved a chance since I am young with little kids and it is just one isolated met that can be taken care of. Now we just hope the chemo did it's job and if there is live cells out there they are very slow growing, VERY slow!!! Sorry for being so long winded.  PET scans are very sensitive scans.  How are you doing? What is your plans?  I am happy to answer anything to help. Good luck!!",

Then the nurse navigator says a name of a surgeon who apparently is great.  This is right after a mammogram and ultrasound. I had found a pea size lump two days before and now it is a Friday and I am all by myself!! A nice weekend to live through with \"it doesn't look good and we will find you a really good surgeon\" on my mind.  .The wait in these earlier stages is horrific so I am glad you have found a bit of peace and comfort while you wait. You still may find it benign so keep your head up and if not you are ready to fight!!:)  This is the beginning of a roller coaster ride and hopefully it's a short ride until you find it benign.  But I echo the other girls who talk about anxiety or sleeping meds.  I remember so well feeling good for a moment and suddenly panicking or going to bed and waking up in middle of night sobbing all before being officially diagnosed.  Also I would pace around my house looking for something to take mind mind off it for a little bit of time.  Biopsy, for me, was done the following Tuesday and saw surgeon Wednesday before results were back and on the surgeon's day off!  The sense of urgency you mentioned was all too familiar as well.  My heart goes out to you! Hang in there! You are dealing with a tough area of road that will smooth out soon once your questions begin to get answered. HUGS!!!!",

After a while your warrior attitude will prevail you will be scared and terrified a little less every day. Then at times is stress or scan times the balance will change for a short period. I agree with kareenie, bring someone with you (level headed) and take notes! Keep all papers they give you and create your own chart at home. Good luck to you!

I have three children ages 3-7 and they are my easiest source of strength. Then I have to work harder to think about myself, but you HAVE to take care of yourself to take care of your kids. I was diagnosed stage IV two weeks ago after almost two years of dealing with chemo, surg, radiation, more surg, and so on. I think I am still in shock after crying and struggling and worrying ever since my dr. called to tell me the news. Whenever I felt and still feel my most scared I always think \"at least my kids don't have this diagnosis or this treatment or this surgery......etc...\". This simple statement always calmed me. Face this head on and show your husband how strong you are and that you can handle this. Search for and focus on things you enjoy and spend time doing them. You need a mental break if just a few moments at a time. You are in a terrible place currently, but time will help to heal your emotional wounds. Focus focus. Wish I could help more, but this is all I can do is offer encouragement and personal experience. Hugs",

I had a room full of ladies, not sure why, figured it might be cool procedure??? Pretty entertaining for me as well since you get all the fun drugs you want, don't feel much, and I got to check out what the biopsy looks like afterwords. I come from a medical background so I enjoy this kind of stuff, hope I don't offend anyone or scare anyone. It was so much easier than I anticipated and recovery was simple as well. My super cool and frightenly young dr. was anxious to show me my sample and what a \"good\" biopsy looks like and what's normal so so biopsy looks like in that little specimen container. They went through my upper left butt cheek and punched a hole through my bone with a chisel and mallet. Watching it often with some scan or ex-ray, not sure what it was, but it followed progression till met was reached and there you have it. Confirmed stage IV just like that . Now reality is setting in. Confirmed two days ago. See radiologist and onc next week to figure out plan. Glad we should have cancer specifics to use for treatment plan. Very scared, but ready to get to it!! I say get the biopsy if you can to confirm type. Wish they offered it almost 2 years ago for me at initial diagnosis when it was 5 mm. It' still small now at only 9 mm and they did it successfully, now it's been sitting there for nearly two years doing who knows what.",
