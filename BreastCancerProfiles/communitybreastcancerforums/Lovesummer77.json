I have had them in the past so I wasn't worried about it at all. As that one was healing then another one came up right next to it so it appeared so much bigger and started to ooze. I went to the doctor and and she gave me antibiotics. The oozing stopped however it didn't completely go away. It's left what looks like to me scar tissue or a cyst. It doesn't hurt anymore like it did when it was a pimple. It is raised and red all the time. I went back to the doctor about it and she said we will just keep an eye on it to see if it forms another white head. Being pregnant and super anxious all the time hasn't helped. I would love if someone could shed some light on what it may be and how I can get rid of it because I want to breastfeed and I'm worried it's something serious. Thank you Log in to post a reply",
