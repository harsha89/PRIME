After palpating it and comparing it to the left it was noticable that there was a pea sized hard mass in my right nipple. Not in the tissue below or around it but the nipple its self. Now i have lumpy breasts to begin with, but those are always soft and change with my cycle. This one feels like a little marble. Its slips side to side eaisly enough but feels fized to the tip. I hace no discharge or inveesion of the nipple, ive been watching it for 3 weeks to see how it would change with my cycle. It hasnt grown, but it also hasnt shrunk. So obviously im worried about cancer, im a mom of 2 young boys and did breast feed both. The mass its self is not painfull, but the surrounding tissue hurts if i mess with it. Im planning on scheduleling an appointment with mt D.o. this week, just reaching out to see if any wlone else had the same the same thing. Log in to post a reply",
