Feel like I got a shot of calm now. I am planning to read and reread your post. Great information. Surgeon is removing sentinel node for biopsy and widening margin. So I guess I'm having a lumpectomy minus a lump. I'm still reeling from the diagnosis. I don't like any of my choices. Reading and signing consent papers for lumpectomy is in itself stressful. Go in for a lumpectomy and maybe due to unforeseen problems, end up with mastectomy?? I don't like idea of rad or chemotherapy. It's pick your poison. This is especially difficult for me b/c I'm not a fan of conventional medicine, avoiding it most of my life and eat pretty much clean food. Surgeon said rad starts one month after surgery, so I should have time. I go for breast exam and mammography each year, each one 6 months apart. My last mammogram was normal in April, 2016, so I thought. . At my 6 month Gyn check, I had an area of concern and he sent me for ultrasound which they diagnosed as two benign cysts. Not feeling comfortable with the report, I went to breast surgeon. He pointed out a lump that I hadn't been aware of and was overlooked by my Gyn, and after needle aspiration, diagnostic mammo of THAT breast, surgical excision, MRI of both, I have a diagnosis. In a way I am thankful/lucky that the breast surgeon took the US findings further. I'm not familiar with bilateral disease. Is it ductal tumors in both breast? I'm sorry. It seems whenever a diagnostic mammo is required in my area, these breast centers only check the breast of concern. I'm glad you were aware of the possibility of this condition and able to seek treatment elsewhere. We try to do all the right preventative measures and yet, oversights, carelessness, incompetence, and sometimes dismissal of our concerns cause unnecessary havoc in our lives. I think many times it's all about luck, or maybe a guardian angel watching over. Roche",
