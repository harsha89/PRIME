That was unable to find this \"spot\" (which happens to be on the right breast as well). They told me I need to see a surgeon and have a f/u mammogram in 6 months. Well, I went to the surgeon today who said, \"I honestly can't tell you why you are having these symptoms. I will not lie. We will have you come back after the 6 month mammogram. It is weird the suspicious spot was on the breast with discharge though.\" Really? No kidding! So frustrating.  I even told her it is spontaneous and abnormal for me....There must be something wrong! I am a nurse and I asked all the right questions...In conclusion the doctor gave me a script for an MRI and said the insurance would not cover it most likely because I do not have breast cancer...but she cannot say for sure I do not! She said since my discharge is not bloody she is not concerned. Sigh.  She only wrote for the MRI when I asked about papillomas and ductal abnormalities not showing up on mammogram and ultrasound. It is like she was mad that I knew about it...Ugh! I just want to know if I can move on with my life. Why is it so hard to get answers about this!? Can anyone identify with my story and what was your outcome? Please let me know? Thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",

Only the mammogram.  So they say come back in 6 months to see if it changes...it may be nothing. 6 Months is a lot of time to sit around and do nothing when it comes to my life though.  Also, what if the problem is in my ducts?  Why wouldn't she want to look into that? Thank you for your response. :)",
