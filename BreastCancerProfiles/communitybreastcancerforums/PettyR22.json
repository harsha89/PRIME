My name is Rachel, I\u2019m 35, married, daughter born 10/13/15 (she\u2019s perfect in every way possible) and a five year old dog I treat like my first child. I do my best to spoil my family. It\u2019s what makes me happy! When I was six months pregnant I found a hard lump in my right breast which I though was milk duct related from pregnancy. First time mom and all I had no idea it could be something else. My doctor did an ultrasound and said it looked like a cyst but \u201cnot the bad kind\u201d. We would take another look after childbirth. I thought, ok great! On with my healthy pregnancy! I delivered a beautiful little girl on 10/13/15 shd have been completely in love ever since. A couple weeks after I had a biopsy done on the growing mass in my right breast that confirmed on 11/13/15, exactly four weeks after she was born, I had breast cancer. Everything just sort of stops spinning. I look at this beautiful newborn baby and wonder if I willing ever get to see her grow, know her little personality, will she remembers her mommy and how much I love her? It\u2019s heartbreaking, and you only know this feeling when you have been there too. One week later I had surgery to get a chemo port placed. First time in my life I have ever been put to sleep or had surgery. Pretty simple and quick so never fear this! One bit of great news is I tested negative for the BRCA gene so my daughter is at lower risk than if it had been positive. Thank you! I started a trial chemo drug called Cisplatin in December of 2015. I had four rounds a dose once every other week. I did not lose my hair, it made my face very red and I slept for a day or two. By the end of the first week and the whole second week I felt like myself, very good and could take care of my baby!! With all the chemicals flowing through my body I had to abruptly stop breastfeeding of course! The switch to formula went well for my baby thank goodness, but for me...i developed an infection on my right breast which is not good for someone on chemo. My husband and I spent a week in the hospital in February of 2016 fighting it off. Thank goodness for my mom and sisters who came to my rescue and watched my baby so he could stay at my side in the hospital. Family is a blessing like no other to me. Friends and family are what get me through these times. By March of 2016 I was ready to start AC chemo, also know as the red devil. I had heard many horror stories about it and was pretty scared. I cried the first time getting that chemo and the nursers truly are the kindest, best ladies there are. Chemo nurses deserve some kind of honor or special holiday/vacation each year for what they do. Truly. The first night I felt pretty rough. Even with all the nausea meds, neulasta on pro body injection and meds, I still felt pretty sick and slept for three days. After that first time though I have to say it got easier. I woke up one night after the second round of AC with a fever and spent another week in the hospital fighting an unknown infection. I look back now and think I was having a reaction to the nuelasta on body injections but I do not know that for sure. The AC did make my hair fall out but my mom had bought me really cool wig that looked just like me! I started playing with make up a lot and could make myself look and feel pretty good! By May of 2016 I was done with the red devil and ready to start Taxol which I had heard was much easier Chemo (if there is such a word). After six rounds of that, my oncologists discovered that my tumor was not responding to rose treatments and was in fact growing. It was time to stop chemo and get into surgery. On 06/24/16 I had a radical mastectomy of my right breast, 14 lymph nodes removed, my pec major removed and a skin graft of my right thigh to help cover my chest. I spent three days in the hospital and went home with two wound vacuums. Recovery was long but by August I went to the beach with my family! In September of 2016 I had completed 30 rounds of radiation to my chest and returned to work! I was convinced I had beat cancer and that part of my life was over! I\u2019m October I celebrated my daughters first birthday!! What a joyous celebration and I was there! I\u2019ll never forget the way she looked that day. Life went back to normal, I had checkups and felt great. In December of 2017, I started having spasms in my right leg which left it numb. During my routine check up with my oncologists I mentioned this and he scheduled an MRI of my brain to be on the safe side. The MRI confirmed our fear, multiple brain tumors and one large enough to cause these symptoms in my right leg which needed immediate surgery. Here I was, one week before Christmas and we find out the cancer is back, brain surgery needed now, and we\u2019ve got to check and see where else it could be. Everything stops spinning again and at a sudden instant. My doctors start me on steroids immediately to reduce brain swelling and these meds will make you a complete crazy person. Emotions are wild, eat 24/7, face and belly are like hot air balloons! But they save your life! On 1/5/18 I had a tumor removed from left frontal lobe. Two days later I was back home with my family and have been recovering ever since. I went Friday to have a CT scan of my body and a full bone scan. After leaving the scan my oncologists called me right away, which is never a good sign. He was informed I had a blood clot PE on my right lung. My husband and I were terrified! I asked him, am I going to die in the next five minutes? To which my doctor replied, I don\u2019t know! Go to the hospital now. A wave of calm came over me. This would not be it for me. That was not the last time I saw my daughter. I was going to see her, hug her, kiss her again. We drove back to the hospital where I completed my bone scan, yes, I went ahead and had the scan, laid there for 30 mins still as could be knowing I had a clot in my lung and potentially another. After leaving the bone scan my doctor had scheduled an emergency ultrasound of my legs to check for more clots. They found one small clot DVT in my right leg but it was not a complete blockage so I was sent home. I cannot start blood thinners yet as I\u2019m two weeks post brain surgery. I am hoping to start them today. I guess when you are faced with sudden death, the reality of fighting for more months or years is put on the back burner. It\u2019s very surreal. Since my doctor had to call me about the clots, I was able to ask him if the scans showed anything else to which he could confirm they did. I have multiple tumors on my lymph nodes, lungs and liver. Ranging from 6.8cm, to 4cm to 2.9cm and so on. He was not able to discuss them further since it had just been read. Today I go see my radiation doctor and it will be decided if I can do radiosurgery or whole brain radiation to take care of the other multiple small brain tumors I have. I will be fitted for the helmet for radiosurgery if all goes well. After that I see my oncologists to discuss the other numerous spots in my body. Am I treatable? What is my outlook? Will I see my daughter turn 3? 4? These are thoughts that constantly run through my head. I want to be hopeful and I will do anything to be here with her longer. I am a fighter and I love so very much! Please talk to me, tell me I have hope and there are treatments for women like me that will work! I am here for you! You can do this too! We\u2019ve got this together! Love and Peace, Rachel",

My doctor sent off the tumor that was removed from my brain this month and they are testing it to see exactly what it is and if there are other treatment options. We should have those results back in a couple of weeks. I got fitted for the SRS helmet Monday and will start radiation for the 13 brain tumors on 2/01/18. I\u2019m happy to get that going! My onc said I\u2019d probably start gem chemo right after radiation is done. I hope it works as when I the other three chrmos before the tumor only grew. I\u2019m praying for some result that the tumor shows I have more treatment options. Thank you for your light and love and response. It means so much to me.",
