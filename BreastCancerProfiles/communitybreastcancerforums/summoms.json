    "Content": "summoms wrote: hi, i just have recovered fromy first lumpectomy for DCIS lowgrade/stage 1,to find that i will have a second bcause of lack of clear margins. since the surgery wasnt too bad and just inconvient, i am ok with that. SO has anyone had to have a second surgery and were the results clear or did you have to have a mastectomy. i just want to know if it is common to have the second and how often there will be clear margins after the second. also from what i read on the pathology i am ER/PR positive. i have heard mixed reviews on treatment for that: hysterectomy vs hormone. anyone have input on that.
