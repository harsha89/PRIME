I also just had a pea shaped hard lump come up under the opposite armpit. Its very painful and making my whole arm ache. Increasing aching in my shoulder blade. I am due to have my re-check on my mammogram the end of the month. I am hoping they will go ahead and schedule it to make sure the symptoms are not from what they thought was benign before.",

They advised they believed I had ligaments twisted in an odd formation and sent me home. I then received a letter stating to make sure their diagnosis is confirmed I need a follow up mammogram six months later. Its now been 5 months and I am experiencing pain in that breast along with pain in shoulder, shoulder blade and armpit all on same side. Should I be concerned? Log in to post a reply",
