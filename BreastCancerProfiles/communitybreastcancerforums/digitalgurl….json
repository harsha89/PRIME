      "Content": "digitalgurl wrote: Hello, new here.  For the past 1.5 weeks I have been stressing out regarding some changes I think I 'm seeing in one of my breasts.  First I was sure I had IBC due to a small itch that went away after 2 days, then I noticed some swelling, which my bf (bless his soul) told me is not really happening, that my breasts look the same size they always have, although i have put on some weight, so they both have gotten a little bigger. Then it was ILC.   I've poked and prodded so much that I have given myself bruising on both breasts. I make him look and feel them every day for size and texture changes, I'm driving him absolutely crazy.  I feel lumps all over but normal stuff, nothing hard.   Now I'm convinced that the shape of the bottom of my breast looks weird when I lift my arms up, I was also convinced that I felt thickening.  He and I spent 30 minutes going over every section of my breast to compare tissue and it feels the same in both.  I'm convinced my nipple area looks weird.  I'm so panicked about all of this I haven't eaten, I have been suffering numerous panic attacks and I can't see the doctor until tomorrow. I'm 34 years old and had been diagnosed as having a fibrocystic breast when I was almost 27.  I was given a clean mammo and u/s back in 2007.  Unfortunately, due to my own irresponsibility, I haven't been for a physical exam in 6 years.  I'm so stressed out that maybe something has grown to the size of a golf-ball and I haven't paid attention to it. I'm scared that it's so big and deep that I just can't feel it. I'm convinced I have Stage IV cancer that has mets to my stomach.   I'm also a hypochondriac.  I have thought I was having a heart attach, melanoma in multiple places, a brain hemorrhage, aids, you name it, I have thought I have it.  I'm just scared because I feel like there's something wrong, but my mind has told me that before.   I'm also due for my period very shortly.  My sister thinks most of this is hormonal but I'm so freaked out.   Log in to post a reply",

The left may be swollen, I just can't tell because the right one to me is bigger anyway. I was also concerned about their being a sort of flattening at the bottom when I lift my arms up. Could this by cystic? I read that any change of contour or tethering was a cause for concern.  I was also having a few shooting pains last week and I have definitely had those also in this same breast throughout the years. ",

      "Content": "digitalgurl wrote: hello! To make a very long story somewhat short - I had a chest ct done in march for some lung issues. Nothing found on scan except for slightly enlarged axillary lymph node. Freaked out at the dr office when she told me as I know this could mean BC. Although I had just had a skin biopsy on the same shoulder as the lymph node. My PA examined me and said all felt normal. Followed up with a u/s of lymph node but it was back to normal by that time. Sonographer couldn't find anything and seemed irritated I was even there. Results clear. No masses. Nothing. Decided to look at my breasts in mirror. Saw this slight up and down indentation on the outside of the breast and then a slight indentation under the breast when tensing muscles. Went back to Dr. he didn't seem to think anything of it - said it was muscular and that it's more concerning when dents stay when not flexing/moving. Didn't order a u/s or mammo. Left very upset. Immediately called the breast center at the local hospital and met with breast surgeon who said everything looked and felt normal. There was a bruise on the lower part of my breast, prob from me poking at it. She ordered an ultrasound just for my piece of mind. Results were negative. The slight indentation on the side and bottom are still there. I call them back and they arranged for me to get a mammo and full ultrasound of breast/axillary today. Office called me and said everything was negative. I asked that the dr call me back so i could ask her why this slight indentation is happening. She once again said everything on both exam and imaging was normal and that since I had fatty breasts, imaging was very clear. She said she could tell I was uncomfortable and that the next step would be an MRI but cautioned that it could come with a host of unwanted biopsies etc. but that she didn't want me to fester with anxiety over my previous results. She said in her professional opinion I don't need the MRI and she was only going to order it so I could relax My insurance is mostly pay out of pocket so I'm torn as to what to do. I worry about ILC and it not showing up on imaging studies except MRI. I'm so torn. Btw I'm 37 and have had a mammo at 27, mammo and u/s at 34 and then again today. Advice Log in to post a reply",

I'm not sure if they compared them but the lady said they had requested them and they had them. At 27 my NP sent me because I told her my grandmother had BC (or so my mom says - she was never treated but had a large mass and lived with it) in her late 70s/early 80s. I didn't have any symptoms. In 2014 I had a freak out and that's why my doctor sent me - they never found anything except fibroglandular tissues.",

Some days it looks like a shadow, other days it looks like just a very slight indentation. Definitely not puckered in very slight. Not sure if it has to do with my breast tissue changing and becoming more fatty? The other breast is and has been much larger and different shape so I can't really compare. Sometimes I think I see the same slight indentation on the other breast but can't be sure. I'm just stressing that something is being missed and it's spreading everywhere inside me. The breast center told me to call them on the day my next period started with is about 2 weeks away. So as you can imagine, this is very stressful for me.",
