I am just so scared,I have been reading on the inernet about IBC and am just totally freaking.I mean how could he tell me he doesnt think its cancer by feeling it??Its underneath my left breast closer to my rib but is on the breast..it feels hard,cant move it and not really a lump but thickening...can anyone maybe give me any advice,info..anything,I would appreciate it! thanks!

My left breast has been itchy off and on for a couple years now,not really a rash but mabe a slight discoloration(sometimes I think its from the actual scratching),sometimes I get a prickly feeling then I have to claw at it,it seems to feel different to me,but not to the doctor ar my husband,i have a thickening underneath it close to my chest,its not the skin thickening though,its somthing in it,also its a little bigger,but not really noticable just a slight difference.I also have pain in my back on the left side,upper back. I was just wondering what does the orange peel skin look like?I have seen many pictures but most women say they didnt have it that bad so I was wondering what exactly does it look and feel like?I hope you dont mind me asking!Also what will happen monday when I see the breast surgeon?
