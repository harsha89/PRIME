I'm doing great, no sign of disease. Didn't think I'd see my children grown. I was the mother of the bride last year! There have been so many great strides in treatment since then. I took Tamoxifen for 6 years, along with Bonefos (for ten years). I now take Femara and am on a tetrathiomolybdate clinical trial. I joined the trial because I wouldn't be here if not for other women in other trials.   You can get past this.",
