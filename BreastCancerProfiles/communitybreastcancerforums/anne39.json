Have mets in spine, pelvis, and a 5 cm spot in the liver.  I relapsed in the lungs  after 17 years in 2010, but have just had mets in the bones and liver for one year.  My lungs are fine after radiation in 2010.  The liver spot is troubling to me.  I would appreciate any info on Afinitor esecially the combination with Tamoxifen.  I am 75 years old, have perfect lab reports, and would never know that there was anything wrong with me if I did not see the scans every 3months.
