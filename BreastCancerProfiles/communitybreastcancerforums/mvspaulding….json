Good luck and keep us informed, it is helpful to talk with others in the same boat. Missy",

Sherry, I am 43 now.  The first time I had a lumpectomy I was 37 and it was a benign fibroadenoma in my right breast.  The second time was last year and it was also my right breast and after my mammo I was referred to a Breast surgeon.  So I was kind of thinking this must be a little different.  When I had it done my surgeon was sure that it was a fibroadenoma again but she said she also took some of the tissue surrounding it.  Whent he report came back it was benign but the tissue around it had ADH.  I am kind of thinking I should just get the hysterectomy done instead of trying the Lupron shots because of all the added side effects.  I guess they could still keep my one good ovary right?  Just being able to talk about this with people who know is awesome.  I feel like I cant really talk to anyone about this, because they think I am worrying too much.",

I will get through this and hopefully just have it removed and have some radiation. Although it is a way worse recovery and surgery, I am actually thinking of just opting for the mastectomy no matter what. My Doc says it will depend on lymph node involvement and my genetic testing that was sent out today.",
