My advice is, seek out those who are supportive, it does not mean family ( in my case no) and hang onto those positive friends. It's a hard time for you, and just remember it's their fear. That is distancing you. My best to you",

My axillary and sentinel nodes were totally replaced by tumor and extra encapsulated, 12 out of 14 nodes positive,ducts, widespread involvement; ducts ,lobes and nipple affected, lymph and vascular invasion and no clear margins after my final surgery. That was 13 years ago this month. I am well and most likely you will be too. There areis great advancements currently with BC treatments. I KNOW it's a scary time, but you will get through it as so many other do. Stay strong, know many many women survive this diagnosis. come often to these boards for support reassurance and good information. Hugs to you for a gentle road that no one wants to travel on.",

The HER+ 3 means that you are positive for the HER mutation an amplification of X3. Some people don't have a hard time with AC. Make sure you drink lots and ltos of water the day before,the day of and the day after your infusions. You didn't say if your er/ pr negative or positive...

I was almost 50, and at first told I wad probably a stage 1 BC. During my lumpectomy, I actually heard the surgeon say I really \" lit up\", meaning my nodes were affected. Sure enough when I awoke from Surgery I had 12 positive nodes (out of 14) extraencapsulated, lymph and vascular invasion, IDC, with lobes ,and nipple spread, NO clean margins and my tumoe was er/ r negative and later fund out I was also HER2 positive. Holy Crap!!! Shary, I was diagnosed with stage IIIC almost exactly 8 years from your diagnosis. Although I don't have ILC, I do know ILC is highly reactive to the chemo regimen you are receiving. Pam, since you are ER/PR positive, they need to look closely at your Ovaries. You may be BRCA positive, which kicks up the ante for ovary removal. Try not to be too worried. Your docs are taking good care of you, Dear Ladies, Back in the first days of my dx (almost 8 and 1/2 years ago) there was bad new after bad news. I never got clean margins from my final surgery and my  had to present my case to the tumor Board as my prognosis was  so dismal. Please remember this was  over 8 years ago, and the landscape pf BC tx is truly getter better. I have now  just returned from my 6 mos check up (I was actually 5 months late!) and am FINE. Please hold on to the fact that it is a rough ride, but you will get through it. Come here often for support and accurate information. It was so reassuring to me that I wasn't alone in this stage III journey when I was on these boardd daily. There are more and more ladies out there just like me. We keep in touch and all have moved into a wondrous world post BC. I wish you all a gentle ride and a soft landing on the other side of BC. God Bless.",

Only those who have walked in our shoes really know. When you are newly diagnosed though, it is an extremely senstive time. A casual remark by some insenstive person can send your reeling. Don't spend any energy on non supportive people. Surround yourself with those who are positive only. I was dxed with a stage III dx almost 4 years ago, and i am still stunned by remarks  I got. I am fine now and you will be too. Save your energy or at least laugh at the idiots. take care.",

I am convinced on it's merit for BC. It's ridiculously inexpensive and aside from some minor GI stuff early on, I had no problems with tolerating it.

I retired and and living life in profound gratitude and joy! here's my post from May 2014 I am writing this with enormous gratitude that I have reached this 9 Year BC anniversary. I've recently returned from my 6 mos check up, and finally had the nerve to ask my sweet Onc if he thought I would make it back then. He smiled and told me if anyone would, he thought it would be me. You see back then it was a recent development that an additional classification of C was added to the Stage 3 cases.There was only Stage III A. and B then. This meant for me that had I been diagnosed a few years earlier I would of been classified a stage 4 and would not have been a candidate for surgery, or the treatment I received.( My onc was part of the team at MD Anderson that pushed for this additional classification to provide an option of CURE for cases like myself) Anyway, to throw another ratchet in, I was also HER2 positive and when he told me that he looked really disturbed. I was actually happy since I knew I would probably get the newly approved Herceptin and just maybe it would work for me. He told me he had seen HER2 cases(BEFORE Herceptin) to be the worst BC prognosis and did not have any long term data for a case like mine. However, my dear Onc, held out his hand to me and said 'We're going for the Cure for you\" I remember telling him then to throw everything he could at me. You see, I had just lost my Mom to Met BC and he was also her Onc. and we all had walked the long road of metastatic dx together. That was 9 years ago and I am well. Living Large! I don't let a day pass without thanking God for my health and blessings I have in this life. I am blessed to share my life with a wonderful man who stood by me, while some members of my family ran for the hills. I have 2 beautiful girls and healthy happy grandchildren and a new baby boy coming in August! I am blessed to have my faith , and have truly long time dear friends. Upon my return home I went back to my career in research, but it would be Breast Cancer Research this time. How cool is that to be able to do that?! So many new treatments and lots of good outcomes. Anyway. I am posting this to say hi to my old timer sisters on this board and also to let the newer sisters, know my story. There are lots of us out there. I wish all a gentle road on a journey no one wants to go on.",

It's scarey as this is unchartered territory and you don't know what to expect. Also, things move quickly and that adds to the anxiety. Once you start treatment however, it does actually help as you will feel more in control. There are a few things to keep in mind. Stage III is simply to category to determine treatment. You will get aggressive treatment, which I think can be a good thing mtoknock out the baddies. For me, I was where you are over 12 years ago, staged at IIIC and scared sick. I found these boards, informative and very comforting. Came here often for reassurance. There are many many of us stage IIIers out there living life way beyond this blip on the radar. You'll get through it too. I wish you a very gentle ride through this time.",

The Ca is contained to the breast and nodes, that's good.  PET scans are highly effective in determining visceral ( mets to organs) and bone mets. Not so good at picking up breast & nodes ( most likely because of the size) Also a grade one is a slow growing tumor, which is also good. The treatments that have today are so so much better then they were yrs ago. I speak from  experience, all the female memeber of  my family died from BC ( previous generation) and I was diagnosed over seven years with stage IIIC dx.

Unfortunately, Scanxiety is something we all experience. To manage my fear , I took comfort in the fact that our protocol is quite aggressive which is ultimately a good thing in the long run. I looked out what I could control, modified my diet, and left a very high stress job, and put my needs first. I did find there are many of us Stage III er out there living long healthy lives. Know this fear does dissipate with time. You will move on albeit, gradually. My diagnosis was 13.5 years ago. I am healthy, and the BC experience is way way back in my memory bank.   ",

Let me explain something that is not relayed typically to BC patients; There are 2 ways of determining a BC stage. One is Clinical Staging ,the other is Pathological Staging Clinical Staging-A person who has neoadjuvant chemo (after her biopsy , but before her breast surgery) gets staged only on the clinical findings: Doctors exams and scans. She then has her chemo and depending on how she responded to chemo has her breast surgery. (Often times a person who has neoadjuvant tx has more invasive disease then originally staged , simply because of the limited information of clinical exam and scans only. rememember pos nodes frequently do not show on scans,( none of my 12 showed up on my PET) as well as other positive findings) Pathological Staging-A pathological stage is determined when the patient has surgery first; sentinel node, axillary clearance, mastectomy, etc. Based on the Pathological report ( from the specimens obtained duirng this surgery ) then determines the extent of the BC , and thus a Pathological staging is obtained. Then she has her chemo... It's a bit of a debate which way to go Neoadjuvant(before surgery) or Adjuvant( after surgery Chemo) However, there is very little statisical difference in the overall outcome for a patient. I am acutely aware how we all get caught up in staging..It's something we all do..... but staging is only a tool that drs use to determine treatment. Please don't get upset by the staging change.On exam I was a Stage I-II. I went with Adjuvant tx WAS stage IIIC. I will be celebrating 10 years of good health in 3 months. Hope this helps.. ",

She was very jaundiced and her abdomen was very very large due to a build up of fluid called ascites. Anyway, the proceedure does not take too  take long, I would advise that your FIL be put under anesthesia as it is a painful procedure. Often times they do not anesthetize patients, as the procedue is done in the radiology lab. But I would insist for his comfort that he be put out. After the proceedure, my mom improved very quickly, and was discharged within a week. She was back to her old self She had mutiple mets in her liver. She did pass away but the procedure enormously helped in making her more comfortable. God Bless  Kim. I will keep you and your family in my prayers.",

I can certainly understand you're feelings of wanting them to go forward with the proceedure. Take Care,",

You are in the early days which for me was the hardest. I am a nurse as well and  was dxed with Stage IIIC;mega nodes 12/14 extracapsulated and actually both axillary and sentinel nodes were totally replaced by tumor, lymph/vascular invasion, ducts, lobes and even Pagets of nipple i'd HER 2 pos, and after final surgery  small dirty margins on chest wall.  This was all in 2005. I am well and although BC is always in the recesses of my mind, it  pops up only occasionally as a memory. I wish you a gentle ride. We've all been there. Come here often. It will help.",

Her tumor type is a slower growing, indolent type, then some other types of BCs, and yes chemo does remain in the tissues for a time. It is quite normal to expect things to move quickly, but healing from surgery and being off antiestrogens at time of rads is standard. Also having more nodes at time of surgery is extremely common, as scans often do not pick them up unless they are quite large. I myself had 12 positive nodes, 2 were actually extraencapsulated and none of my nodes were detected on my PET scan. She had a good response to her chemo which is extremely favorable. Finally, rads does a good job of mopping up any residual cells. I also did not have clear margins either ( within 1 mm too) and am fine now approaching 12 years. Sounds like you are a great support to your wife. Please reassure her she will ok!",

I had 12 pos nodes, both axillary and sentinel nodes completely replaced by tumor and no clear surgical margins. I stayed on Herceptin for 6 years and did annual PETs for 5. I was txed in Florida initially and then moved back to my home in the Bahamas for my Herceptin. I think the key is what mutation is driving your ctcs to be elevated. In my case it was the Her2 amplification. Have you considered getting an expanded panel for DNA mutations. There are tests outthere for 22-25 . I pushed very hard for my treatment and getting on board with a progressive Onc is the way to go. ( I do think your current Onc has been great) Also you are kind of in a grey area for clinical trials, as you are not technically a stage IV. However you could take a look at the trials for stage III, and see if you fit. Www.clintrials.gov. Insert stage III breast cancer, and all studies will pull up with their location. I can send you my Oncs information as well. Stay positive. I don 't believe you will progress to stage IV, if you get the magic bullet for your mutation. My thoughts and hugs are going out to you. linda    ",

I had a R  mastectomy, 4 cycles of AC, then 4 cycles of Tax  & herceptin, Radiation Tx and then a prophylactive L mast. I had bilateral recon, and eventually  got my \" life \" back. Take good care of yourself at this time, come here often for support and accurate information. remember the tx is not easy  and it can makesyou feel bad, but it's the tx and not the disease that makes you feel this way ( that helped me alot) Suround yourself with only positive people, who will lift and support you at this time. there are so many of us out there living \" large: you will too I hardly ever come \" here \" any more, as I am busy again with my life, but saw your post and wanted to give you something to hold on to. God Bless",

Staging criteria can actually differ depending on a number of factors, including  geograpical locations, along with what entity is doing the staging. Where I received my treatment only those with CNS (brain/spinal cord) visceral ( organ ) mets or bone mets were staged at IV. Those with recurrence to local areas, such as lymph nodes as your Moms were termed Local recurrence. However in both local recurrence and metastatic recurrence, what the drs are recomending is  right on. What is much more important then the \"stage\" is that you Mom's scans are clean, which is a blessing. As the doctors advised her they will treat her to keep the disease from progressing.",

I too still have pulling, and pain issues in the axilla area( and its' 8 yrs now) I had 14 nodes removed and I see you had multiple nodes removed too, so that means the surgeons  did a pretty large & deep dissection of the area, which equates to scarring and residual discomfort.Incidentally,  I also see they didn't pick up your nodes initially, Me too. I had extraencapsulated nodes, with total tumor replacement of my sentinel and Axillary nodes, total of 12 pos  and nothing showed on my PET. I have since  learned  , that this is pretty common. frequent times nodes do not show on PETs or CT scans. Live and learn Anyway, getting a full chem panel would be good. There are a slew of other issues that are non related to  BC! and these metabolioc profiles can be very telling.  Palpitations are increased with anxiety, and your lack of sleep , you need some repreive.  Please get a good physical exam and review of your labs.
