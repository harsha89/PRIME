I took disability from work while undergoing radiation.  I couldn't focus on work and I was tired after my treatment.  I did walk everyday and made sure I ate citrus fruit (it is suppose to help while having rads), and took care of myself.  I went back to work about a month after my last treatment, and had no problem focusing.  There are days where I wonder if I'm tired because of what my body went through, or is it just being a full-time mom, wife, and holding down a job???  Who knows? I'm participating this Friday in Relay for Life at my daughter's college.  I'll walk a lap for all of you ladies!!!!!!!!!!",

I'm going to check out the website that is referred in the postings and read up for my appt tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing all this information, ladies!",

Good luck, Eliza.  I'm sorry your family has to go through this.",

Good luck to all of you.  It's overwhelming at first, but know you can do it. ",

I took disability leave from work while undergoing radiation.  My job is pretty demanding and I was finding that I could not concentrate the closer I was getting to radiation.   I went back to work full-time a month after finishing rads. I am a redhead so my skin is pretty fair.  I would put on the Aquaphor daily, so the skin wasn't too bad.  It was sore by the end, very hard to wear a seatbelt.  I did experience fatigue while having treatments and after I was finished.  I also walked several miles everyday before my treatments.  It helped so much when I was feeling down - just put some really fun tunes on your iPod and it will help!!!   Fortunately, it was the Spring so I was able to walk outside.  When I got home from rads, I would have lunch and then nap for 45 minutes.  This helped me get through the rest of the day.  I didn't want to miss anything with my kids - I never missed my son's high school baseball games.  I stopped lifting weights.  I just started lifting with the new year.  I can't lay on my stomach and sleep as I used to, but it's much better than what it was.  I also echo vivre's thoughts about eating fruits and veggies.  I had read that citrus fruits are helpful while having radiation.  I would eat fresh pineapple and oranges daily.  I also would eat salad every day.  As each month passed, I felt stronger and stronger.  I moved my daughter back to college the end of August and I know that I would not have been able to do that in July.  Having friends and family that are supportive also helps how you feel.  Rely on those people, let them help you if you need it.  Good luck to you, you'll be finished before you know it.  I kept the schedule on my frig with the % completion for each appt.  I would come home and cross off that day.  It felt good to do that. I wish you well.",
