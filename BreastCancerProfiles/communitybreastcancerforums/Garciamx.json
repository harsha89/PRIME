      "Content": "Garciamx wrote: Hello, I had a double mastectomy on 07/14/09. I had problems with one of my draining bulbs and it was removed early. The PS put pressure on my breast and while in her office I drained through the hole of the drain that was removed. Well since then I have been draining through my stitches..this has been ongoing for a week now. My question is..Has anyone else experienced this? I also feel that my breast feels full and it looks a bit swollen. I don't want to freak out cause what is draining is not red blood but a yellowish fluid and I don't have a fever. But I am so scared and I think just tired from all the pain on the side where I am having all this trouble. Any thoughts/advice would be appreciated.

We will try to put in the tissue expander in 6-8 mos. Although I am seriously debating whether to just give up on having implants. I am so tired of all of this.Â ",
