I was diagnosed in October 2017, exactly one month after my 40th birthday and first mammogram. Gosh- that seems like a lifetime ago already. Anyway, due to a separate diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome, an uncontrollable movement disorder, radiation was determined by the Radiation Oncologist as \"too risky\" so it was confirmed that a mastectomy was the right path for me. However, scheduling with the general and plastic surgeons proved to be difficult, so my general surgeon scheduled me in for a lumpectomy and SNB in November 2017 as a \"staging\" procedure (to figure out the stage and pathology, and as a holding pattern until I could be scheduled for the bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction). I started chemo at the end of December and had my last treatment about a week and a half ago. YEAH! The plan for April is to have a BMX with immediate placement of TEs. Then, ultimately go back for a 3rd surgery to exchange the TEs for implants. I have had surgeries before, so while I am nervous about my upcoming BMX, I have some idea what to expect as far as surgeries go. I am not nearly as nervous as I was about starting chemo! I appreciate all of you who have posted your surgery experiences so far. Wishing you a smooth healing process!",

But, she is sending me a coupon for $70 off of a wig from their website in case I am interested in another one. May use it to try a halo, but I'm not sure. Sounds like they have many good programs available and the lady emphasized they are available for calls 24/7. Here's the number ifanyone is interested: 800-277-2345 I am so grateful for all of the amazing organizations out there. Brings some light to a sucky situation.",

I didn't get into work for even an hour and exactly one week post treatment, landed myself in the ER with a fever. After multiple tests, I was hospitalized for 2 nights with an infection and neutropenia. I still don't know exactly what they found but I know my chest X-ray (x2) and CT scan showed them something on my lungs. Needless to say, my mind is circling around the worst case scenario. I have a follow-up with my primary tomorrow, so hoping to get answers from her. Like most of you, I am totally exhausted and have had more emotional days than good days. I forced myself into work for anywhere from 2-3 hours this week, but each day I came back more tired than the last, so I am taking today off. I tend to always be on-the-move and don't sit and relax well, which is one of the reasons I chose to keep working, but I don't know if I can keep this up. Even as I type this, I am so physically and mentally tired, but also stir crazy. Anyone else like this? If so, how do you keep busy? As for lifestyle changes, I'm not sure. I am going to watch labels a bit more when I buy chicken (no hormones etc), but other than that, my oncologist just recommended more a diet of veggies, fruit, lean meats etc, so no major changes other than cutting out the beloved carbs, but I like to try and follow the motto, everything in moderation. After a foot injury, I had to cut down on my exercise so now that that is healed (thanks to all the rest I am getting), once I am recovered from chemo and surgery, I want to build my workouts back up to 4-5x/week. Hope everyone has enough energy to enjoy the upcoming weekend. -LA Mindy",

Basically, more tests are needed, but there are some growths on my lungs and they couldn't clearly determine if it is an infection or possibly \"the C word\" as she put it. I had a chest x-ray less than a month prior and it didn't show anything, and the sentinel node biopsy did not show any cancer in my lymph nodes, but just hearing the doctor say it is possibly cancer freaked me out. My primary deferred to my MO, so I emailed him to ask for a PET scan and anything else available to put my mind at ease. Have you ladies ever heard of cancer growing during treatment? I am not allowed to drink alcohol during chemo, and probably not until a month after my last chemo (which is this Friday), but damn can I use a stiff one right about now!",

It was physically painful and kind of depressing to see and feel my hair falling out with every move. Fortunately I am not wanted to a crime because I left my DNA in a lot of places this weekend . Although my closest girlfriends offered, I already promised my boyfriend that he could shave it for me. But he was working out of town all weekend so I had to wait 2 LONG days for him to come home. I couldn't wait to get rid of the thin limp strings that were left behind, weakly griping onto my scalp with their last breath. I cried when he turned on the clippers, but once the hair was gone, it was such a relief! I still have poky Velcro like hairs on my head but I am basically bald. I wore a ski hat yesterday and tried a halo wig with a cute hat today. I got hot and itchy, so midday I took off the hat/wig in the office and I was comfortable rocking my baldness. In fact without hair falling everywhere and without any major side effects this week, dare I say there were actually moments that I forgot about cancer???!! It was awesome! Have another set of labs and see my MO on Thursday, then chemo#2 Friday. My WBCs have bounced around drastically. No idea what that means for me, but I am feeling strong so I am crossing my fingers hoping for the best. For all the ladies with low WBC counts- my fingers are crossed that you are able to boost them up enough to get your next treatment. Sending healing thoughts your way. Oh and I have to warn you, MJB- be careful because you must be contagious! \u2026 after reading your post, I think I \"caught\" your cute hat addiction! (HAHAHA) I just went to amazon and bought a bunch and I can't wait to get them! My BF's cousin knitted 2 hats and they arrived today- also super cute too. I am having fun trying out this new for me accessory trend. The wigs are kind of itchy and I can't wrap a scarf to save my life so hats are a fun way to cover up when I don't want to be bold and bald. In fact, I may wear them all at once and write an update to my favorite children's book, \"Caps for Sale!\" Sending positive thoughts and warm wishes to everyone.",

Laura- your scarf looks beautiful on you. I understand how your daughter must have felt. Your fight with this stupid disease will only make her see how strong we can be when needed. My older sister was not as brave as your little girl. She asked me not to remove my hat when she visited me during but my last treatment. I respected her request but it was hard for me to palate. She had been much more attentive in her calls since she saw me last. Guess the reality of my dx finally hit her. Mjb- so sorry you are struggling this round. Sending warm and healing thoughts your way. Daniz- water is horrible for me too. I did better mixing it with Gatorade when I was sick earlier in the week. Now I am making a mug of weak mint tea (from Trader Joe\u2019s), diluting the heck out of it, and drinking it over ice. I can taste the mint over the nastiness. My nurse coordinator also suggested popsicles as they \u201ccount\u201d as fluid too. I got citrus flavored sparking water too because I can also taste citrus. I was told to get \u201cfluids\u201d any way I can if I can get enough regular water in. My goal is to force 2 bottles (21 oz) of plain water in each day and then do whatever else I can to get other fluids in. Welcome kayak! Happy Saturday all! Mindy (Ps. Chemo brain sucks!!!!!!).",

Daniz- let me know how your broth turned out AND if it helped with your counts. The hair loss is very hard. I cut mine to my shoulders a week post chemo and I am really glad I did. The long strands falling out were bad enough- could't imagine what it would be like seeing my full length hair on the floor, my desk, in the shower, etc. I shaved it down to little fuzzies and now they are coming out too. But honestly those falling out don't bother me. I can't imagine doing this with kids. It's hard for adult friends and family to deal with, but the little ones do tend to bounce back pretty quickly. Your daughter will see you kick cancer's ass, then come back to be stronger than ever for MANY years to come. EJean- Yep I'm on a 3 week schedule too. My WBC levels required me to have 3 shots at home (my BF injected them for me). He will be out of town in the next 3 weeks, possibly when I will need shots.

I don't want to use it if I don't need to, but there are days when I am just soooo tired and saving myself those few steps will be a huge help. Had a consult with my PS yesterday too. I had already made the decision to have a bilateral MX, and my OM strongly supported my decision based on my medical history, so I know it's the right one for me, but wow... this is going to be a heck of a process.

A little about me and my BC journey so far\u2026 The day after my 40th birthday, I saw my primary to get a referral to PT for a foot injury. After the referral, she sent me directly to mammogram knowing if I didn't go right then, I would delay it months or years (she knows me well). Let's just say I sent an email a month later thanking her for saving my life. What would normally have been what the doctors call a straight forward case, my journey had an unusual turn. See, I also have Tourette Syndrome, an uncontrollable movement disorder. Because of this, radiation was determined by the Radiation Oncologist as \"too risky.\" They were considering me for a newer radiation procedure called brachytherapy, since I wouldn't have to stay still during radiation, but there isn't enough research on the long term benefits of patients my age, so that was also ruled out. So, I had a lumpectomy as a \"staging\" procedure (to figure out the stage and pathology, and as a holding pattern until I could be scheduled for the mastectomy with reconstruction). After I recovered from the lumpectomy, I had my first chemo the day after seeing my MO, 12/22. He said that we had to start right away because there is a 30 day post-op period when chemo is most effective and I saw him on day 31. YIKES! The good part is that I didn't have time to work myself up into a panic, the bad is that I wasn't as prepared as I would have liked to be. The chemo treatment itself, Taxotere and Cyclophosphamide, was fine. I only have to have 4 treatments, 3 weeks apart. I had mild side effects initially (some queasiness, low energy, decreased appetite, and taste bud change) and expect to lose my hair by the weekend (2 week mark). But, my white blood cell count dropped, so my MO put me on the Xarxio shot, every other day, for 3 doses. The first one was easy- my boyfriend injected me without issue and my energy level went back to almost normal. But the 2nd shot hit me HARD. Within a few hours, I had excruciating pain in my lower back, hips, legs, and knees. I haven't felt pain like that in my life and it brought me to tears. I remembered hearing about Claritin for bio-similar injections so I called and got the \"ok\" from the pharmacist yesterday evening. I'm not going to lie- the pain got worse before it got better. The pain has been better today, manageable even, but I'm petrified of the shot tomorrow, my first day back at work since chemo. Work has been accommodating, and I have FMLA protections in place, so I will just do what I can, when I can. It looks like there are a few ladies in here with similar dx and treatments planned.

I managed to get my period DURING my first chemo, and again just 2 days after the last one ended. I had to go off BC pills due to the hormones so my system is all out of wack. On the joys of womanhood. Thanks to everyone for the nice welcome. I had the second shot this morning and so far only a little pain/soreness. My MO called me and ok'd for me to take Norco (have some left after the lumpectomy) if it gets bad again. Said my marrow must be working overtime- guess the shot is doing what it needs to do, but dang! Made it to work for a whopping 2 1/2 hours (of a 8 hour day), so... yeah me! The head boss (aka my boss' boss) saw me today and called me into her office. She told me (almost a directive but in a super kind/caring way) to work at a satellite office MUCH closer to home. She said if I have the energy to work, no need to waste it driving! This will cut my commute by at least 2 hours daily and is a win/win because they will get more work out of me this way too. Sorry to hear so many of you are having stomach issues. Sending positive vibes and healing thoughts your way.",

I emailed my MO because I thought I was starting a cold (chills, slight fever, stuffed nose, and sore throat) and wanted to know what I can take. After approving OTCs, he said to let him know if I had a cough with sputum, shortness of breath, or a fever at or over 100.4. I responded that I am easily out of breath after walking a short distance (i.e. car to front door), have had a flutter in my chest (active and at rest) for a week or so, low grade fever but below 100, and ongoing nose bleeds. He emailed me back and then called me right away, sending me to the ER because my symptoms made him think I may have had a blood clot (pulmonary embolism, I later learned). All kinds of tests were run and thankfully they all came back normal. They gave me a half of a bag of IV fluid and sent me out the door. I have been feeling pretty good, despite the symptoms, and have been trying to lead a (new) normal life. I do tire very easily, but I've been trying to push myself. Unfortunately, I may have pushed myself too far. I am totally and completely exhausted. With my other (before cancer) diagnosis, I have a lot of crazy feelings in my body- some painful and some just annoying. They are my normal even though I know what I go through is unique to me and someone with similar diagnosis. I have learned what is normal and what is not. I know when I need medicine and when I can push through without. Chemo has sent everything I knew about my body into the garbage. I was advised not to overdo internet searches and I've tried to follow that, but I don't know what's normal and what's not. I am one that doesn't like to complain and I know battling cancer gives us some free passes in this department, but I still don't know when to tell someone vs. when to just shut up and bear it. I had kept the heart flutters to myself, and now my family is upset at me for not telling them and clearly my MO was concerned about this as well. So here's my question. With all of these new feelings and SEs, how do you know when a side effect is something we just have to deal with vs. something that requires a call to the doctor?",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2018 10:07PM - edited Jan 4, 2018 10:30PM by LAMinders Dives- I was born Mindy (not Melinda). I am also very impressed with the multiple sets of eyes verifying the right poison...l mean medicine... is being injected into the right person. I am glad they only use my first and last name and not my middle- otherwise I too would be looking around to make sure I wasn't getting yelled at by my mother! Swewing- Love Stella! And love the idea of naming her. My wig is sitting on my bureau reminding me of the inevitable. Tomorrow is the 2 week mark when my MO said to expect my hair to start falling out. Hope my wig looks as good as the ones you all have! mjb- My nurses said I don't need to suck on ice for my treatments, but I am still game for a snow cone machine! Daniz- my head has been in a constant fog since treatment, but no blurry vision, although I may remember seeing that as a side effect on the handout I was given. I agree with Laura- if you are worried- call. Hopefully speaking with the doctor or a nurse will help put your mind at ease. Paulette and Hariry- I made bone broth in my Instant Pot last week after reading it could help boost immunity. Threw some bones (with marrow) that I bought a the market in with some veggies and garlic. Very easy and loved knowing exactly what went into it. It made so much that I froze into multiple containers and, when I remember, I pull some out to drink. I figure I'll eventually make a broth based soup this week with the rest of it. I am 2 weeks post treatment and am finally getting some more energy back. I worked for more than 4 hours today and even got a workout in with my trainer yesterday. Nowhere near where I was before treatment, but it felt amazing to lift some lighter weights. I woke up in the middle of the night with a nose bleed. Haven't had one of those in probably 10 year and never in the middle of the night. Finally got back to sleep and had a nightmare about losing clumps of hair with my scalp still attached! Sure enough as I was getting ready this morning, some hairs decided to jump ship in the shower and my bathroom sink. Brain fog has officially hit and I am having some issue with word retrieval. Kinda scary and very frustrating. Other than that.. life is grand. Gearing up for another set of labs tomorrow, then back to the MO on Thursday and Chemo the day after. Not looking forward to round 2... but this too shall pass. Truly appreciate all of your honesty and upbeat attitudes. Warm wishes from sunny (but chilly for us) Los Angeles.",

I threw them in the instant pot (an electric pressure cooker) with a variety of veggies (carrots, celery, onion and garlic) and about 4 cups of water. The pressure cooker went for 4 hours and then released. I have read that I know I did it right because there is a thick layer of cologen on the top from all the marrow. I drink the broth warmed up (like a soup) but I have so much that I'll probably make a soup out of it this week. Google Psychology Today's article \"The Healing Power of Bone Broth- it gives a little info on why the broth is supposed to be good for you. Bought a vaporizer yesterday and today is this first time in 2 weeks that I've woken up without a dry nose or dry lips. So thanks for that idea! Yesterday was a REALLY good day for me. Other than losing hair left and right, I felt like myself energy wise! Hoping that will continue until my next treatment on Friday. I could really use a good week.",

I started making a list of SEs, even if they seem trivial. I have been totally and completely exhausted and have tried to push through it. I finally listened to my body and left work early on Thursday and took Friday off. I can hardly believe it, but I slept for nearly 11 hours both of those nights without waking up once. I haven't done that since I was in my 20s after a night out on the town. Clearly my body needed that rest as I am starting to feel better. Needed to get out for a bit and I had to pick up some things at Target, but by the time I was done, I nearly collapsed from exhaustion. Ok, lesson learned. Kayak- I am still angry at that woman who was so ignorant. I loved your blatant and honest response. I agree you do not owe her an apology. If anything you taught her a very basic but really important lesson, one I used to teach my students with special needs, \"Stop and think before you speak.\" Laura- Tajin it is a spice that I found in my local market (Ralphs) but I see it sold on Amazon too. I see it in the spice aisle and sometimes next to the fruit. It is a combo of chili spice, salt, and citrus flavoring. It is nothing I would normally use, and will probably never be able to look at it after treatments are done, but it is incredible for now.  Swewing- My period has been all over the place. I stopped taking the pill shortly after my diagnosis (hormone positive). Got it the day after my lumpectomy, the day of my first treatment (during the infusion, thank you very much) and once a week for 3 weeks. All super heavy. Now, I haven't had it in 2 weeks. I have no idea when to expect it anymore. MJB- my surgeon said I would be able to go back to work in a few days, but the nurses said to anticipate taking a week off. I wound up having the surgery the week of Thanksgiving, so I had that week off of work anyway. I was grateful for that because I used every minute I could to recover. I was still not myself the following Monday (exactly a week post op) that my work sent me home early. I like to think of myself as superwoman, but my friends and family like to put me in my place and remind me that I am only human. Damn them! Sending healing wishes to everyone.",

Was thinking about you, so I came back to catch up and send good vibes as you are approaching the end of your chemo treatments. One most after my last treatment most of my side effects have finally stopped, with only a couple of minor, yet super annoying ones remaining. My energy level still isn\u2019t back and my eyebrows thinned even more. Thankfully a few stubborn ones are still hanging on, giving me a shape to fill in with brow pencil. Also- my eyes randomly tear up and flow down my face at the mostly inopportune times and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m crying. My onc said it\u2019s a normal side effect but if it persists I\u2019ll need to see a specialist. After my first chemo, I had my period once a week for 3 weeks and all were very heavy. Haven\u2019t had one since then. My oncologist said it\u2019s normal and may not return for 6 months, if it comes back at all. Apparently I have gone into \u201cchemo-pause\u201d with the dreaded hot flashes and all. I was on birth control for years and stopped after diagnosis since I'm hormone and progesterone positive. After my surgery I'll start tomoxofin, which can also affect menstration so who knows if it will ever return, not as if I\u2019m complaining! Daniz- I did the LGFB class. It was helpful and I came away with a huge bag full of make up. Go in with a clean face and they will walk the group through make up application to hide the chemo side effects and highlight your beautiful face. Enjoy it!",

UGH.  I feel like a clown sometimes. Yes, my eyelashes seem to have stayed, although when I apply mascara, I feel they are a little more sparse too.  I think the tearing is actually due to dry eyes, although I don't have any other dry eye symptoms.    The hair on my legs is growing back, and I have a few that grow under each of my armpits. I enjoyed not shaving for a few months!  Now if only the hair on my head would start growing back, I would be really happy!  I'll probably start taking biotin after surgery to see if I can speed up the process.  ",
