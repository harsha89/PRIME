I've only had 2 mammograms total and I found both uncomfortable. My appointment is tomorrow morning. I am scared and worried. Thank you for sending positive thoughts. ",

I came home today to a voicemail to call the hospital for my mammogram results (instant panic as last year they called my cell with good news). I've been told there is a nodular density in my other breast and I am freaking out!!! I can't do this all over again. I have to wait 2 weeks for a follow up cone mammogram and ultrasound, anyone heard of this type of mammogram? Thanks.",

My ultrasound is still scheduled for next Friday, but I'm hoping they can see me tomorrow for that too if I wait patiently long enough. Hope that all is well with everyone. ",
