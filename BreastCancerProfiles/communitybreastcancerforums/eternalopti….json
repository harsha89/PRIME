I know you will want to get back to normal asap, but remember to just take it easy. Since your parents will be helping, let them take the kids out and let you rest. Take advantage of down time. You deserve it. Good luck and warm wishes are being sent your way.",

I am most likely going to go up one cup size. I believe I misunderstood time frames and need clarification on what to expect. I have my ups and downs (as we all do), and am getting very nervous. Thanks in advance. It is so extremely helpful to know there are so many of us going through this..........together!",
