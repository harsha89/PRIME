The radiologist said it would be tomorrow that I would hear, and I feel better than I did yesterday when I made that post. I cannot control what my body has done but I can control my attitude, and I have decided that no matter what the outcome I am not going to lie down and give up. I will post tomorrow when I hear.",

My doc is my ob-gyn- we have a 25 year relationship and she is terrific. I will have an appt with the breast surgeon, Dr Jodi Chambers (my doc's recommendation and I trust her) next Wednesday. Dr Panter, my ob-gyn, said the next step will probably be wholeÂ  body MRI. Dr Panter was calling from home - she will fax me the report tommorow. I am numb, I think. BTW, if there is anyone reading this in the Denver area I live in the foothills west of town- Morrison. Would appreciate any input. I will post more when I know more.",
