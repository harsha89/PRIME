My hairdresser convinced me to shave off at that point so my wig would fit better,but now i have half a shaved head and half bald,looks so horrible i try not to look in the mirror without bandana or wig. So glad u found a wig that makes u look like u Mellie,i'm still trying to find a red one that isn't maroon or strawberry blonde. I was at the bank yesterday and the teller asked me why i had colored my hair and cut it short,she said she loved my long natural redhair. so i told her my story(she is very sweet and wasn't being mean). She's in her late 30s and said her aunt died of breast ca in her 20s and her grandmother also had breast ca 20 yrs ago. I told her how my gyno had bugged me for years to get a routine mammo and finally told me he wouldnt see me again if i didnt go(and we all know whats happened since then).She said she's also put it off but would make an appt immediately after hearing whats happened to me.She said that this might be my purpose to tell other women to go get their mammos even if there is no lump and you feel perfectly healthy. The radiologist i had the mammo at is right across the street from the bank,she could go on her lunch break. This made me feel so good,if i could help even just one woman,think how many others i could share my story with. I'm not going to hide this experience anymore and encourage who ever asked to go for routine mammo if they havent. Hugs to all,Angela",

I haven't gone to any events or even support groups i know i'm not ready yet and i'll cry the whole time. You are amazingly strong and have been through so much.Stay positive,you are a survivor and have done everything you've needed to do.Try to distract yourself with something all consuming and fun,surround yourself with people that love and support you,talk about your fears to them. Your last surgery showed no lymph node involvement and you've removed all potential breast tissue,focus on the facts,your percentage is like 92% maybe better. It's easy for me to say these things to you but hard to say them to myself,I get it. We all love and will pray you are going to be fine,Hugs Angela",

It's alarming though to hear that traditional radiation over the left breast damages the heart and 10yrs down the road chances of a heart attack really go up. I really hope and pray my breast behaves and i can get the proton radiation. Hugs to all,Angela",

Not the neuropathy but neurontin has helped that though a side effect of that has been depression(I think).The depression also could be from radiation,lack of family support,or lack of sleep because of restless leg too, though.I didn't have the skin issues,that and having to be in the hospital might have thrown me over the edge,but it was truly awful,worse than adriamycin and cytoxan by far.The good news is I felt better 2 to 3 weeks after my last one so there is an end to the torture coming for you.I promise you will be glad you finished and will feel so much better soon.Rambo,miss u girl,what's up?

Your oncotype dx score is a test on ur tumor done if u have no mets to ur lymph nodes. Its a genetic test that calculates ur reoccurance risk,under 18 is low and if ur breast cancer has been removed and hasnt spread to any lymph nodes u may decide with ur doctor to forgo chemo. i had a9mm positive lymph node and considered not doing chemo because my score was 16. After talking to family and onco,i decided even with a low oncotype with the mets to my lymph node i had to put my big girl panties on and do the chemo. If i didnt have kids and a hubby,i might have risked it. I even considered going on a trial,have of us on chemo the other half not but my daughter crying to me on the phone begging me to cover all my bases with chemo,changed my mind.",

Sleep,well,i get it when i can,there is nothing worse than being up at 3am with all those nasty thoughts(you all know what i mean). Ativan helps not only nausia but anxiety and sleeplessness so take it if u need it. Constipation,ugh,who knew? I'm taking womens overnight laxative tabs,and melatonin 3mg which is for sleep but has a nice side effect of stool softening. Husband freaking out unless i am wearing wig,put a scarf on for bed and he nearly jumped off the couch in fear. So I'll put the wig on first thing in the am,take the stupid thing off while he's at work then pop it back on 5 mins before he gets home from work,if it makes him happy why not. Hang in there all,this is not our summer but next summer watch out! Angela",

My sister in laws family member owns a salon specializing in hair loss and all i wanted was a wig that looked like my real hair(long,red,curly)and even with that connection the closest i got was strawberry blonde,straight,shoulder length. Its difficult and it shouldnt be,my insurance still hasnt paid the salon anything(luckily i had a family connection).Some people are strong enough to be proud or secure to be bald and beautiful,I'm not,I cant even look at myself in the mirror without something covering my head,when i start losing eyelashes and brows it will be another big blow.First we have our breasts chopped up,then a alien port stuck in us,and some gain weight (ive actually lost 15lbs)not too pretty either,and then to top it off our hair. I quess u all can hear im still pissed about this whole thing. Just hearing your wig troubles got me going,sorry for my rant.",

I also wondered if it was the zofran but cant be because its still there days after i stopped taking zofran,so my only conclusion is its from the chemo.Luckily i havent suffered from any mouthsores yet,is that a se of my 5 round when they change my chemo to taxol? I want that magic mouthwash on hand if thats the case.

I have a wig,supposed to be red but nothing like my real color,times like this i wish i was brunette or blond at least i would look like me. Reality there is a prescription med called nystatin swish and swallow that might help with ur mouth sores. Starting to get chemo brain,i think? or maybe its just emotional overload.

I'm shocked they had someone with c-diff anywhere near anyone else. It's highly contagious to people with a healthy immune system never mind us. When a patient had c-diff in the hospital they were isolated to their own room and bathroom with a big sign on the door to put on a disposible gown and gloves. When doing homevisits I would also completely cover my clothes with disposible gown,booties covering my shoes,and double glove(and never would use the same bathroom). And this is when i was healthy.You did the right thing scrubbing,etc,but you never should have been exposed in the first place.

Girlstrong,if I could have a do over I would have done the mastectomy.Everything was such a rush and a shock at the time and I went with the lumpectomy because that what my husband wanted and the dr recommended.I finally start radiation today,it's taken alot longer for physics to be done than they thought.The doctor wants 35 txs(7 weeks)because of the size of my breasts,it's going to be a long haul.Hang in there all my friends and warriors,I think of all of you everyday.Hugs Angela",
