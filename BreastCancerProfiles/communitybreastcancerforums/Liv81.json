The ultrasound tech left to talk to the radiologist, came back and told me all they saw was breast tissue and to come back at 40. I called my OBGYN's office and they told me to see a surgeon but I would have to go through my primary care. Primary care tried to order MRI first, denied. I have been waiting since then for an appointment with a breast surgeon. I did see his np 3 weeks ago, but she couldn't tell me anything other than it didn't concern her too much and I can either wait and watch or still see the surgeon. I of course want to see a surgeon and he didn't have an appointment until December 13th, 6 weeks later!!! Now I have a squishy lump next to the other lump that basically formed overnight. Feels like a cyst to me, but I don't know for sure. The lump that started this is pea sized and soft and hasn't grown that I can tell. I have cried every day since finding the first lump. I have 3 and 5 year old girls and I am a stay at home mom. The worst scenarios keep going through my mind and I have this fear of being sick or something happening to me and them not having their mom. I feel so alone and like no one is taking this seriously. I haven't even seen one doctor and it has almost been two months!!! I called the surgeon's office yesterday for the Millionth time and told them if the Surgeon can't squeeze me in sooner then I want an appointment with his np and for him to come in at the end. Any ideas what he can do? He probably can't needle biopsy the lumps without an image of them, especially because one is tiny and kind of deep. I would like for them to be removed and tested but I just don't know what to expect. I am praying he doesn't brush me off. Two months have already been wasted waiting for an appointment and my anxiety is crippling. :( Log in to post a reply",

I expected everything to go quickly and for doctors to take this seriously and it just feels like I haven't gotten anywhere. If an MRI was denied once, do you think a surgeon has more pull with insurance? I am even ok with surgery, I just need to know so I can either move on with my life and stop worrying, or get treatment. The not knowing is ruining me and I have a constant stomach ache and lump in my throat. Now that a second lump formed basically overnight I am even more terrified. Not a lot of people take my insurance (Celticare) and so I am afraid if I do find another surgeon I will just have to wait even longer for an appointment. If this man doesn't seem like a right fit I might not have a choice though.",

I think maybe because nothing showed on the ultrasound or mammo that it wasn't an urgent situation to them. It is to me though. I just keep thinking what if it is cancer and I have been sitting here with no doctor seeing me all this time.",

I keep daydreaming about what the surgeon will say to me and where we will go from here, but I need to try to block out my negativity until I have a reason to be negative I guess. So hard though!! I hope his phrasing will get me an MRI or he will do some kind of biopsy. I need to know for sure what's going on. Thanks for listening because I don't know anyone that I can relate to at the moment.",
