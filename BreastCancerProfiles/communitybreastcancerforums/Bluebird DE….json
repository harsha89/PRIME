Rheumatologist said pulmonary hypertension with enlarged heart. That was with an ECHO and high def CT of chest, report said mod enlarged and the PH is definite but not sure the real degree. Cardiologist tomorrow. To check degree of the PH they want to run the catheter into the heart, my heart. Not so sure of this. I know I was struggling with lupus and shortness of breath for long time but I think I was on Ibrance / Femara when my heart started thundering. Need to find some record or remember. Or it could have been when on Xeloda or that just aggravated it more. I was also on Faslodex / Arimidex for about three years. But have been a mess and the new rheumatologist has uncovered the problem and we are on the trail of getting me better. Right now rheumatologist has me on a low dose prednisone to give some relief, also CoQ10, hawthorne and L-arginine, L-carnitine, etc. Lasix. Oncologist (new for me too, and a real gem) today told me to take a Xeloda vacation, so an extra week off between. PET CT Monday. Oh and pulmonologist October 11. I feel so special. NOT. Read all your posts and some other referenced threads and checking into the FB group mentioned on another thread here at BCO.",

      "Content": "Bluebird-DE wrote: This is what haunts me.  I just don't understand how it happened.  The time between my surgery and first mammo and ultrasounnd was 2 months, but I did ask for a pre-surgery MRI or something, anything to show changes.  He didn't need it. Soooo, can anyone explain, or have you had similar experience and why did it happen.  How does a skilled, one of the most respected surgeons in the area leave a positive margin when removing a 9cm x 9cm x 3cm tissue section with a 3cm x 3cm x 1cm tumor in it? I don't get it. On the lateral side by the node that was completely cancer.  There were 60 cancer cells in the tumor, some neucrosis and scarring in the tumor. Now I understand this is intricate work, after all, I did just google this :::: from Amazing Facts About Your Body:::::  \"In one square inch of skin, there are four yards of nerve fibers, 1300 nerve cells, 100 sweat glands, 3 million cells and three yards of blood vessels.\" Read only if you have time and are interested in full story --- To me, then the BS was dishonest. I had intense swelling and the incision opened on its own, fluid running out of me, nope, no drain tube for me. Edited to say that is me being sarcastic, as other women got  drain tubes but my bs did not give one to me for lymph removal.  So went back 5 x or so for infection and swelling, plus one post op and one 'finished with BSurgeon' appt. First time back for drainage, swelling, he did not tell me about the path report. Second time, he said the pathologist thought the margin was too close, path wanted more shaved off. i was shocked. Did not discuss it with him, we were dealing with my infection. Third time back, drainage again, I asked him to draw for Hubby and me a picture of the margins, what was close. He drew it, and it was definitely negative distance. I said, you were in there, you thought you did the job, I trust what you thought during surgery. Fourth time back, I told him if I felt the need, I was going to not have more surgery, I would do a DMX if we did more surgery, not just getting the margin shaved.... and that was because I was having so much pain in both breasts which I had already been having pre-surgery. He said the pain was from surgery. Fifth time, more swelling issues, so now, a month after surgery, he wanted me to have tube in, we could shave it then, but the drainage had almost stopped by then. I said I would wait a few days to decide and it did stop draining. Sixth time I was back for mamm on both sides and ultrasound due to all the pain and finding cyst on other side, which thankfully burst. He said, a MX would be best, that is what he wanted to do when he was doing surgery, and he would then be sure he got it all and I would not be in the pain, we would both be \"happy\" I don't know his word.....but HAPPY sure wouldn't be mine. I haven't spoken to him since because that was the day I got the path report..... I opened the BC survivor notebook they finally gave me because the Breast Care Center called them and said, give it to her.... it had been there since four days after surgery.... then two days after the last office visit I opened it and found my path report right in front.....  PLEASE, I am grown, i made the decision to do alternative long before this BC ever hit my life, it is my belief system, so please just see me as healing, well, making good strides in life, don't worry or try to get me to change my mind on chemo and rads, I am just not doing it yet, maybe someday IPT Chemo Therapy when I feel the need, but not now, so please, I am just trying to get info on the margin deal, thank you so much for understanding, even if you are not Alternative in belief, thank you. continuing.... All this time, I had asked for the path report three times, called for it, told by assistant that it was going to be mailed. Turned out it was in the BC survivor guide that the Breast Care Center had sent to office for me, never given to me, all the info and contacts and how to care for incision and exercise so I would not get LE, all of it. I did not get the report until 7 weeks I think. GUESS WHAT I FOUND? POSITIVE MARGIN. Not CLOSE. POSITIVE. < .1mm positive. He did not tell me and he knew I did not have a biopsy so as not to disturb the cancer cells, just leave them in their little universe the best we could until removed, don't poke the bear I said to him, and he knew I was not going to do chemo or rads. He knew I was going to an alternative clinic, which I never could afford to do since ins does not cover that. He knew though, everything on my protocol. I have him on THE LIST. I am angry with this every day. Edited to say okay, not biting the bullet angry and I am better lately, but still, I am haunted by it, I am scared. The Integrative Med Dr, who is a pathologist both anatomical and clinical, and in nuclear med, said that this is only two cells from the margin, only two cells. But he said we can hope, as sometimes happens, that the scarring will envelop the cancer cells that were touching the green ink and the c cells will then die. Hubby and integrative med dr said that with all I am doing, the hope is there are no c cells now. But I know right after the surgery, there was a long tube down abdomen below tumor removed and there was nipple pain and shooting pain and knife pain in both breast, man, there was so much pain, so I know I am better now because it is so much less and I am so strong now. Right now, he is on the list with all the others, I do not have time to go back and face him.  I will go back and deal with it, but now all I do is one foot in front of the other forward to survival. So what does anyone know about how this happens?  I need help coming to terms with this more than anything so I can get past the uncertainty and perhaps the grudge. Thank you so much  for helping.

I own my feelings on this one.  Confused, dumbfounded, frightened, frustrated, angry, sad, and do not want another surgery, the first was so challenging for me to get to, the next would be a masectomy to get it over with. I had three surgeries in 1 1/2 yrs when I was 30 and all did not go well, took years to recover so was not encouraged in going in for this one, but did pretty well, so was relieved, still. ",

Considering that there was no drain tube for lymph node removal in my armpit, he said I would not need one, not that I did not want one.  I was relieved I wouldn't but did not know what I could go through. Considering that the explanation for the breast cancer still inside me after surgery was not upfront. Considering that when I asked for the path report I did not get it, and the bbook was 'kept from me' for 7 weeks, I did not know it existed. There's so much to shake off and move on from.   I don't want to hate him, be angry, sue him, but everytime I think about it I do feel angry though it is not consuming me.  I know to let go of things so I can survive.  Like the neighbor w his outside wood boiler that is slowly poisoning this family, I let it go and am moving, giving up my home, all our financial security, going through foreclosure and bankruptcy to survive this... but I know that he is too ignorant about what he is causing for me to be angry with him, just the way he is cut, he doesn't get it.  I was furious for two months, beyond belief and then said, this is killing me more, even though I cannot breathe in my own home or yard, this anger is worse.    I just want to understand why the margin was positive because that was the one thing I cannot get past today.  But while I am asking why the positive margin, how?  then I am lookingat all the rest andasking why me, why did he be so careless with preparing me for surgery, for explaining afterwards?  Why did he not even tell me that I needed Tamox afterward, that took 5 weeks and then he offered to write me a prescript, then I found out at postmeno, I could be on the A one, but never was told about it and I would have been on the ewrong one for me, I believe, if I had accepted that Rx.  Thank goodness I do my own homework.   Anyway, I was able to explain to Hubby about the multifocal issue, I am feeling more settled about this, I had not heard of multifocal unttil yesterday after posting, when I stumbled on an active topic then Maud posted the info right after.  ",

When my ins would not pay for Ibrance - the approach to get it was not done correctly and we went round-and-round. But the manufacturer had a program and I was accepted, the income allowance was in the 6 figures, very lenient. NKB - if I may jump in w mho, please. You asked someone else, \"Do you think that there is a subset of people who are actually killing cancer with the Ibrance/Faslodex or femara vs just causing a big pause that will eventually mutate and recur-or just that the pause is longer for some people.\" And with my personal experience and all I read on forums here and two other forums and in reviews.... I think there is a short burst of killing cancer followed by a pause and then rapid mutation. But that is my experience. I think for some body-types, so so speak, there is a real effectiveness. There has to be - the advertisements and commercials are so promising. Trials must have been encouraging, right?

I don't know but I hear this a lot. When we say, \"Yes, but...\" and they come unglued and uncommunicative, it is intolerable. Of course, you can yell anywhere, encouraged, but those are two favs of mine. Let it out then try to let it roll off for now anyway, you have enough to deal with without hauling him around on your heart and shoulders. Lisbet, why aren't you being offered Xeloda chemo? It is a chemo, don't let him confuse you. It can be very effective and simple. Do they assume it is not enough? Being your liver mets, and since Xeloda is processed in the liver it seems a likely choice. Is there anyway to have another oncologist asap? besides him? Or are they assigned rather than chosen? ",

He had his nurse call with this question.... Did I want the TASE (chemo beads inserted into lesions)? because he does not ever recommend that the TASE be done for breast cancer metastasized to the liver. I told her no, I didn't want it, my other oncologist wanted me to have it and I didn't feel like in my condition it was best for me. Well, I feel like I have dodged another bullet. Do not know where this will lead me but now I have a breast cancer specialist that is not research that I lose after a trial is over or I have to leave a trial. Am hoping for the best. Will be seen next week, plugging me into a slot that is filled but will likely have a cancellation. Meantime 2x day I am drinking my cashew milk with red and black Meeker variety raspberry powder stirred in, hoping it helps reduce or stall cancer growth in liver. If the lesions decreased then I will know it was helping since Xeloda didn't do anything for them. And I am still on Xeloda for lymph nodes. Wondering if anyone else has heard this about the TASE for bc liver mets? Or had it and did well or not?",

Felt like the pain from when two lymph node masses in supraclavical had grown together and pushed on nerves, thought that was it. But by 11pm, liver area started and by 2 am had taken me out of bed from trying to turn over to r side and then doubled me over and could barely stand to walk, could not recline on either side. On way to ER that morning the palliative nurse got me in instead, morphine liquid child's dose. But the pain had eased enough I won't take any until it comes again in the liver - makes another episode. Still hurts when I cough, sneeze, burp, but good sitting, walking, sleeping. Am hoping rest and no friction will stop pain completely, no more episodes. Brushing my dog is waiting until tomorrow and left-handed, grandaughter can help me. Hubby will do a little tonight. Danny Boy is a big Newfie and very furry. He has to be ready for guests, grin QUESTION - Is it true that liver lesions will not hurt except for these reasons.

Also I find it very interesting your MO put you back on Faslodex even after progression. I was on Faslo for almost 3 yrs and had progression and want to try it again. My MOs I left behind or who left me behind said no, not w progression but the new MO who is a keepr said it is not against the law or anything. SO I think I want to ask if insurance will pay and if so then let's try it. Right now on aromasin along with mega doses of the best ellagitannins I can use I feel like I am holding my own and most days even improving in the cancer conditions itself. Though after coming off chemo pills and AIs that were harsh for me, the new quality of life sans those in it makes it hard for me to discern what feeling good again feels like compared to feeling cancer sap me of health and energy. But I really want to say I think I am improved in both ways. KayLynne - imho, having known a few shaman including from South America, seriously, the real ones can help you from where they are to where you are. Spiritual travel is nothing to them. They might scare the beegeez out of you if they made an appearance as say an owl in your rafters or on the back of the recliner. LOL but likely the appearance is not necessary, that would just be grand standing. They also, imho, would not assign a dollar amount to your recovery or even need the money up front. They are medicine people and the medicine is given freely to them to pass on to the ones needing their care. Just saying, imho. Healers, the same. The herbs they offer are not only available through the shaman. There are options. And medicine people from North America can get these herbs for you if that is what you feel led to try. Your path will be clear as you move along to the answer. Maybe Universe is sending you the right one for you, maybe your message is this is an option though you need to seek a wiser choice. I say this knowing full well I could be leading you wrong and this could be your chance. You know the decision is completely yours. So look inside, you know how, I believe you will just know. When we become terrified or desperate that is when we can become objects of prey too. We are also capable of our own magic. I get lost a lot but I believe it is true. My liver pain is downplayed this last week. There were a few weeks or pretty scary but manageable pain. Not the gnawing of when I found out the lesions were growing. It was the sharp pain of what I hope is apoptosis and necrosis of the cancer cells, I really do hope this. Then a week ago it stopped being sharp and is not gnawing. Some nights I can feel where the lesions are / were and it is tender when I am on my side. I move more carefully. But compared to the sharpness of pain, now I would say it is down by 90%. And I wake in the morning not knowing there are lesions at all, I feel fine unless pants are too much pressure or I have been strenuous. I know healing takes time. My hope is this is healing. AMW5 - The liver lesions I have were \"seeds\" in April 2016 which were not reported on that PT CT at all!!!! disclosed as increasing in Nov 2017 then grew by doubling in size every 3 months. I had pain from the beginning. When they get smaller I don't have the same pain. They have done both over these many months. At first the Ibrance / Femara addressed them from lesions and back to seeds. Off that and they grew quick. Wish I could do Ibrance / Faslodex / Aromasin. sigh.",

So enhancing it seems it would give more power to that beast too. But I do not take immune suppressing drugs either. The chemo is enough I think. Just learning to minimize the flares or alleviate them completely. Toxicity of the combo.... That is the question. Asking the DO. Will Xeloda with Ibrance be toxic. If so then could I just take Ibrance high dose for cycle / Xeloda at low dose for a cycle with the hormone targeted therapy all along. But if anyone else knows. I have decided to forgo the TACE tx and it's cousin. Through the groin artery into another and another. The body still gets all the chemo too. And less than 50% of patients had no decrease in liver lesion size. And there was no difference in survival time. Per the govt report and more I read yesterday. You know, why can't they just use a needle and inject it into the lesion. Cryoablation is a better choice but there are adverse SEs there too. But looking into that more today. On alternatives / complementary. In 2012 I used a high quality and perfectly combined mix of black raspberry seed powder w red raspberry seed powder and black cumin seed oil. Also oils of the other two. I had had surgery Nov 2011. Did well enough but by summer I was very sick, cancer quite active and no onc yet, I had been doing very well on my choices but then I felt it flare up. So I found this through my daughter's research. And it was in my book but I always thought it too simple to even consider. Talked to the doctors at the study too. He told me to do this this way and in a week or less I would feel better. And I did. That was late summer. I am terrible at consistency. In early winter of 2013 I felt it happen again, couldn't stand flavours of favourite foods. I found the oncologist that was mine until he left for Alaska this Spring. Edited to add - There was one hilar node and seems some axillary then, cannot recall. That was it. I have no scans from before the raspberry / black cumin seed but my oncologist was impressed. Still he told me I needed help. end edit. The ellagitannins of the powders and oils are what I am going to kick into overdrive now, waiting for more supply. And the hemp oil I get from Europe, and yes that will amp immune but also I hope do a number of cancer and the flares. With added pure Omegas 3s. But I want the allopathic too. If I had remember the liver wrapped so far to the right side I would have known there was trouble brewing. ",

Liver mets for me were \"fatty liver\" about 6 mo before called activity w mild to severe SUV uptake, no lesions mentioned. I wondered about the fatty liver call on the PET CT. I am fat. Never has my liver been called fatty in all these years of tx. Then it is fatty? I thought maybe it was from toxicity. But no, it was changes from cancer. Feels like a huge bruise often. And thought it was a pocket of fluid. Biopsy Friday. Onc appt not for 11 days. My oncologist responded to my plea to remain on Xeloda, no sudden moves as the lymph nodes en mass are what will kill me first if allowed to take off again. I am still on Xeloda. Good, becasue I started it 36 hours before his reply. Too scary to be off. ARTIST - This may be the longest shot but I have lupus flares where the joint pain is so unbearable I cry getting out of bed and Hubby has to move my arms and legs when I need to get up and even hold something. I started taking Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA w sesame ligans and olive extract and mainly pure wild fish oil concentrate. It's 2000 mg 2x a day or even a few more caps a day. It helped so much and w lupus flares usually it has to be pain killers and steroids up the kazoo which I cannot take at all. LULA - I know infection can light up the SUV uptake, but in the liver, really makes me wonder. I do know biopsies do not always pull out the cancer cells. I just don't know. Push for your life is all I know, they aren't living it, we are. Right care only. Z - When the cancer is active in my axillary there is a weird scent about my armpit. And I am sensitive to lotions and natural deodorants that I usually use. Yes, we learn to read our bodies very well. When the cancer has been active I have a wild aversion to butter and coffee half & half and my favourite pancakes at Hilltop that have all these good natural ingredients including flax seed. A lot of stuff I really should not have been having due to the high hormone content. At home I don't, using organic dairy if any at all. And never flaxseed. Though I do eat phytoestrogens, just choosy. SCWILLY - I love a good cancer dying off pain. Sometimes it is like lightning and sometimes horrid gnawing. But when I am on a chemo or hormone treatment and that starts it's like BINGO. Unfortunately for me, I had mixed response to Xeloda and the gnawing and bruised pain in liver was cancer growing instead of dying off like the lymph masses were. Now I know to know, but what to do, don't know. Two questions that will help me and others. 1. Is a warm water bottle advisable on the liver where it hurts? Or cool pack? Anyone use a castor oil pack? Could any of these make the cancer happy and grow more than it is? 2. How long does it take for a liver biopsy to be completed and the dx ready for the oncologist? Thanks. ",

I forgot about the Ibrance/Femara but that only worked a few months then quit, though I was left on it for 4 months.

So, basically he was referring to the Xeloda which I was on 8 months, he does not belkieve that the response I had was mixed - he believes I had no response and the radiation confused the other oncs (remember there were two traveling fill-ins and the primary that left and now this onc, oh bother) Also this onc says that it would be \"Ridiculous\" for me to have TACE or anything of the like when I have not even been on the chemo IVs.

I used it before I turned to Dr. G for help and hormone therapy. It had helped me prior with feeling much better. The raw hemp oil is something Dr. G approved of me taking too, Who knows if it scans to prove helpful but when I found out the xeloda hadn't been working for all those months and the liver lesions were so huge there was very limited treatment then I got out my leftover supplies. Don't know if it is helping in size but do know no more liver pain. So onward. The supraclavical broad basin of lymph nodes that had radiation is now swelling and scaring me. Could be autoimmune like oncologist said, could be cancer or post radiation swelling though that was done in May. Never may we rest on our laurels. ",

And I feel very angry either way. I am in process of being referred to a new oncologist for either a second opinion or just referred. I asked DNP's office to do this. No time to fight w or wait on this other onc's next move. I had already formally requested a referral to a doctor in that center and he has not acknowledged my request or said no but I can refer you to someone outside the practice. Liver - still sore but am improved. Cannot lean to right side or over, sleeping is all right. Morphine still in cupboard, untested. If I never have to test it for pain control it will be all right with me. Urine - now light yellow since yesterday afternoon and good today when I woke up. I do do my raspberry seed powder in yogurt, ricemilk and raspberry jam smoothie, it never coloured urine. So am getting some food source. Also testing a tea I drank to see if it coloured urine that dark dark brown. We will see.",

The DNR is part of the forms we will fill out. Liver pain, it comes and goes. Does not like being jostled. Cannot lean over or put on socks without aggravating. And I find using my shoulder is a problem and ensues pain then and later the pain is the worst, so right shoulder relaxed is the way I have to live right now. I submitted a post yesterday on here and two other threads and all were lost due to snow here. Experience, Strength and Hope - if something I share here helps others to get the liver lesions diagnosed and dealt with by cryoablation or radioablation or SIRT or whatever is minimally damaging to the entire body, I hope they pass it on too. Catching us up - I decided to go to yet another oncologist when last one told me to get set up w hospice though we probably wouldn't be using them in the next few ***WEEKS*** he said, and I did not like that attitude. He got only one appt, I went to the next - New oncologist looked at my records and asked nurse to see if I could come in same day - took less than 48 hrs from first phone call to have me sitting with him. WOW! I like him and trust his approach, it couples w my own instinct for survival. Get stronger, just take aromasin for the next month then we will see how I am set up in strength to handle something more aggressive if I should want to go there. He said no to the Taxol and no to the afinitor the other onc had said yes to, he also thinks the afinitor could help while fired onc had set me up w that rx and wrote in his notes that he thought it would rather small effect - seriously, then why would I risk my life, health and time on it, he needed to think harder. So I am on aromasin and taking a month to continue to heal. Which means eating too. He said hospice is a difficult discussion to have and his face just fell, but he said if I wanted to explore hospice then this is a good time, and that we still have options. Now.... about our own liver warning us there is a problem. Mine first acted up summer of 2016, there were no lesions showing in PET CT iend of Oct or the April before BUT I felt pain in the area where lesions developed. When I walked it would twinge, when I leaned to right it hurt! I went on Ibrance / Femara for a few months and it stopped and the scans showed improvement, though lymph node masses did not. So changed tx. Xeloda. And that did not work for liver. When I was on Xeloda this year I wondered if the pain was the dying off cancer cells or was the Xeloda not working at all. Turned out it was liver lesions growing rapidly. I just felt like something was gnawing away in right side, which is lobe 7/8 area. Then I felt like there was a pocket of fluid on side by bra line, could not stand a waistband or bra over the area. The whole time, I told the nurses, the radiation oncologist and the MOs, answers were always about dealing with the lymph node cancer masses that were killing me by closing off airways. And suggesting yet another PET CT - but all they had to do was order an ultrasound! simple, noninvasive and I would have said yes to that. Labs were perfect, as mine always are, even TMs and liver enzymes, so no one was concerned. By the time an Oct PET CT was done the liver lesions were so large they shook up all the medical team and there was basically nothing that could be done short of possible TACE (too weak to go through that) and radiation to shrink but wouldn't get rid of them. So yes, liver lesions can hurt. And we have to be aware of what we feel and make sure we are taken seriously. Reminds me of a thread I started \"Does breast cancer hurt?\" The myth has been that bc does not hurt, half of people w bc are told by medical professionals that it does not hurt. And the focus in realizing the truth behind the pain is thrown off or delayed for too long and bc cancer grows. Liver too. Liver cancer can and does hurt for some. Whether through mets or primary liver cancer, if it hurts, make sure it gets looked at. I have learned to request my own ultrasound for liver, thyroid even breast lumps. Though I am not recommending foregoing a CT or PET CT. My liver mention in the PET CT report when this was starting last summer said \"a fatty liver.\" Never in all these years had my liver been called fatty. Then it was and shortly after it was many small cancer lesions. Then imporved on Ibrance and gone, then back and then hunky big. ",

Kaylynne - I had an oncologist before this one, he saw that expiration date and was going to help it along. I fired him and ended up w this one. He is not perfect but he works with me, listens and supports quality of life decisions even when I would rather push the line. I hope you can find a difference MO that will be fine for you. The reason I say the new one is not perfect is just that - I had the report on the lymph node on my carotid artery and it had gone from 1.5 x 1.1 cm on Oct 5 to 2.5 x 2.5 on Jan 6. But at the last appt when he had the scan and I had the scan he did not bring up the carotid artery. I missed it and now we will visit that issue tomorrow after I have spent the month fretting. Other than this misstep, he is pretty perfect so far. Super OCDC which works fine for me. Grannax - I am in danger of losing the entire right lung. But now it is the center right lobe and the bronchi both being completely compressed. Before for almost a year it was the upper right lobe. I wanted surgery or a stent. Nope. All doctors just spin me around and send me back to the oncologist, I swear. Except my DNP (doctorate of nursing practice). And I know what you mean - thank goodness for this site and the support herein. TOMORROW APPOINTMENT W MO --- I am facing to do any tx more than the aromasin now. Add Navelbine? Add Faslodex if insurance will pay, I was on once and it worked well and quickly. But they have report of progression in 2016 Spring. But I went off it due to increased coughing and thought it was the Faslodex se. Or keep on w the tx I am doing which include aromasin, alternative and complementary. The supraclavical on right is filling in or is it swelling from cancer cells dying? The liver hurts a little after leaning forward, I understand those lesions will not go down right away or maybe never even when cancer cells die. The head pain is seldom now and I am thinking it is sinus but scary for me. The carotid artery lymph node needs an ultrasound I think. Not ready for a PET CT. The right lung center lobe being collapsed could be rectified or not. ack. In general I feel like crap the last few days but it could be cancer cie off since I have upped my ellagitannins AND the hemp oil. Herxheimer effect and all and not drinking enough liquids..... and she downs 8 oz water now. And I run on.... darn. sorry.

Hoping for the information needed to unravel a puzzle. Good news and bad news. And a huge question. PET CT of brain / body was clear, all evidence of active disease was clear. I had cycles of radiation in 1) supraclavical broad basin and at a lymph node mass that was severely compressing a bronchial tube. And I did Ibrance/Femara for 5 mo (which stopped working at 2 1/2 mo) then Xeloda 2000 mg 2x day at ave 10 days on 7 off. Five full cycles. OK - Bad news. The one lesion in lover is doubled w 2x SUV uptake too. Plus another is next two it. These are about 2-in x 1 1/2- in on 1st and 1 1/2-in x 1-in on 2nd. ??????????????????????? 1. How is it I was on the GO-TO chemo for liver mets and this has happened? 2. Do I need a liver biopsy to be certain this is MBC mets to liver and not liver cancer or some other? 3. I have been given all options that includes going to a liver center at U of MI or IU for tx discussion. Or radiation at the center I am at which has one of the three state of the arc machines in the region. So good hands there I am assuming. RADIATION To say I did well on radiation is not true. I got pneumonitis and am still suffering from that! I have lupus and had a lupus flare like none before and feel like it is still ongoing even since April/May rads. I am an inflamed mess, not able to take steroids to help and allergic to cough syrup as we know it. At least the joint pain and fire stopped at three weeks out, but the photosensitivity / radiation is frankly what could kill me quicker than the cancer. 4. Surgery is out, lungs need saved for when there are no other choices. 5. I am considering an IV chemo. Going after the lesions and any floating cells tht can be got, those that are just never going to show on a scan until they begin to multiply. Though knowing it is not the full answer. 6. Also will be back on Arimidex and hopefully Faslodex. ????????????????????????????????????????? So what insight on why this happened. And what could be done now as far as treatment, local or chemo?

Right now I am analyzing my scans and labs to see if going back on Ibrance for the liver lesions will be a viable option. Xeloda let them grow and get stronger in uptake, after 6 mo. If the liver was 'repaired' when I was on Ibrance then perhaps..... the problem would also be how to maintain that clearance, and the NEAD I have right now once the liver is clear again. Ibrance only worked for 2 1/2 mo, so I only have a short spurt to see if it is the thing I need right now. Or radiation, CyberKnife is my choice. Being on 40 mg lasix has helped the cellular fluid build up in my abdomen and stomach, upper thighs. The more that helps the less discomfort I have in the liver region 7 / 8 where lesions are. It was feeling like a giant bruise. Oh, I had said I was going to pay attention to my liver on how the Xeloda was working for me. But I did not remember that the liver wraps around the trunk at the bra line. So I thought that pain and discomfort was from fluid pockets or even trunkal lymphodema. Now I know.",

New ultrasound in March 2018. The dominant lesion in # 8 lobe decreased in size by 2 cm. That said, the radiology report said lesions too numerous to count. Where this was the same as before. Report does not mention the other two lesions that were very large. What ticks me off to no end is we go to have these scans and US and wait for results that are UNCLEAR! NOT COUNTED! and INCOMPLETE RESULTS! while we face life and death decisions. Also one would think if the liver is scanned then they could mention what is seen in the gall bladder and pancreas. But no, not on mine anyway. But at least I have the dominant lesion is 2 cm less. This doesn't tell if the cancer uptake is higher or lower or non-existent. I understand the cancer cells can all be dead but the lesion remains for awhile, a long time or forever. My pain is only when I do stressful movements at a high rate of repetition. Coughing, brushing of the dog, stirring batter. The gnawing, soreness of liver cancer cells going to town has stopped long ago. The problem is the ALT and AST SGOT are high. I don't know how long these labs have been high but it bodes ill for bile duct blockage, though the scan said no ducts are blocked. I see through a search that these could be high if a patient is not told to discontinue these and I have recently been taking NSAIDs, anti-inflammatory meds, and a tricyclic antidepressant and sometimes codeine cough syrup. Yup, all in the last week. So here's hoping it is a false alarm about liver being worse. Diane",

What helps me right now is the dominate liver lesion is smaller reported on my US. And JFL talking about her liver regeneration. Saturday morning I woke up and had blood in my urine twice. Then it cleared. I have to drink more fluids, yes. But was alarming. What could be the cause? A urine specimen and CBC was taken yesterday to check for infection and I assume cancer cells can be determined by that too. Also I had been taking Aleve which can have a rare side effect of blood in urine, mostly for men over 60 and only 3% of over 42,000 reports. But I do rare really well. So stopped taking that, also for my liver's sake. I am thinking the organic sourced morphine for pain is the best bet though I prefer not to go there so soon. Or is it really so soon?

For those going conventional, godsped, no judgements at all.  Consider us a renegade research group, if you will and love us anyway.  Someone has to do it and this is where our heart is called.  So Blubelle, hello.  Added you and Roadshow as friends too.  Blubelle, poste this on antoher thread I noticed, so redundant.  But consider thermography for testing, like a colored film mammo w/o radiation. Generally out of pocket at $150 appx, worth the peace of mind and additional information as you make decisions and follow what you are doing now. Want to say too, the lesions are not the only guage, cancer cells are everywhere.  So watching only those does not tell us if it is gaining on us or actually 'gone'.  The tumors can wall off and be 'dead' and remain in our body's like an old bird nest (per Dr. Gonzales, NY, NY in Outsmart Your Cancer)  So a tumor means it is there, a biopsy also does not tell all, the report could be on a benign section when there are active cells there too.  That is why we need multiple information sources and txs too. Follow close, always change up treatments even if using one always.  Conventional or alternative.  Never think it is over, even when we are told NED, we keep on taking care to stay that way, not wait for the other boot to drop on our breasts. Above all believe.  I am talking to myself now, because I get scared too. send a pm anytime. LOVEEssa",

OK - I am taking control No bronch Monday. No GI scope either. I asked questions at 4 specialists offices - my DNP included - and had no answers. Was the pulmonologist even looking at the Oct. 2 PET CT? Since my report did not mention the lungs at all, what was he seeing? The high def chest scan from 2 mo prior? And did that mess clear up? So canceling first thing Monday morn. No answers, no patient. Will have the liver biopsy. And my oncologist has rxs written for Aromasin (exemestane) w/ Afinitor (everolimus). But that will change if liver biopsy proves to be HER2+ or the ER PR changes. Here's my thing w that. I was on Ibrance and there had been liver activity, quite lot - the Ibrance worked and liver cleared in a few months. But the lymph node masses grew, they got better at first then grew like crazy. So I was put on Xeloda, low dose first cycle. Then stop. Rads. Then Xeloda and stop for 2nd rads. And then Xeloda for several cycles. The stop periods were about 3 weeks each. The liver got a lesion double first one in Nov 2016. Then next scan showed 2 of them and doubled again. On Xeloda only. I think, why throw out perfectly good meds when they worked. IF they can be taken together. The high dose Ibrance and lower dose Xeloda since NEAD in nodes now. And I am game for a hormone target too. Arimidex, I was on that first and long story short, stopped. Or the Aromasin. I think I asked this thought / question before. Hoping for input. But will review and research too. Does anyone know if Xeloda and Ibrance can be taken together? Or cycled one then the other. Opinions on why or why not do this. Keeping other tx in back pocket longer and hoping for best. I would scan again in 2 mo to be safe. Ibrance is swift when it works, at least for me. And is it for cancers besides bc.",

My speciality pharm does overnight when needed, you could ask, if you haven't received yet. I've been off anything for the liver lesions since they were found Oct 2nd. That was a f-up on part of nurses at clinic when it was first prescribed by the onc and then I didn't catch that bcz I decided to delay anyway and have a biopsy first. And more delay due to their f-ups again. I am glad to be away from all that incomplete energy. Nervous as to where I am at. But I am drinking down a huge dose of ellagitannins (Meeker rad and black raspberry powder) daily and using ramp hemp oil, really strong. So hopeful that complementary is helping the Xeloda I was on IF it was working on anything at all. But for the liver, no longer feeling the pain in 7th and 8th lobes, though some in front right sometimes and no longer in front left. Am now off the Xeloda. The new bc specialist at the new center hugely questions whether Xeloda has been working at all. The liver lesions were growing rapidly. The lymph nodes all were radiated in April/May. Xeloda started at same period. I often wondered too. So I am now going on Afinitor / Aromasin. Had that choice or Taxol infusion 1x week. Or palliative care. He said he did not give infusions to patients in wheelchairs, and I am in one when we go out to places like that, cannot walk much and very weak. Lost 21 pounds in 3 weeks. It's all turning around now, I feel it. Ate better yesterday, feel stronger today. Could be the Xeloda was kicking my butt too much for my own good and no one was listening. I was so dehydrated yesterday there were 3 sticks to get labs, they only got a little from each one and hard to use veins at that. My skin looked like I am 90. This is my third day off Xeloda. New center at Goshen is \"nice\" and I now have under one roof a counselor, a nutritionist, a naturopathic doctor, acupuncturist, any my oncologist. Also met and an appt is being scheduled with a top thyroid cancer surgeon. Though I don't think the nodule in my thyroid that is stopping my voice and eating is cancer, but he is a good choice to remove the thyroid. Director of surgical oncology. Patients COME HERE for thyroid surgery, out of their own areas, his nurse told me he does a lot of those. Top 1% in his class, was employed at both Camp David and National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. He lives in my area because that is where he and wife were raised. Lucky me. Ran into him in elevator, he is very approachable. It was like a sign. Am off to find out more on the new tx. Will try to stay caught up better than I have. Diane",

Z wrote, \"I was dizzy, tired, and had terrible dehydration. Thirsty all the time, dry mouth. And, of course, my veins disappeared\" This was from loratadine but I had that from the Xeloda. I am still recovering from anorexia, parched mouth, exhaustion, dizziness, full out dehydration. Have been off since November 20th and now seeing the light. The only good outcome from Xeloda was it put the lupus / mixed connective tissue disease into dormancy. Hope it was enough and holds. I have notes from my new oncologist to share - will begin new post. ",

I had pain another month then started the red and vblack raspberry seed powder plus the raw hemp oil. Pain stopped. Took that solid for 6 weeks. The large lesion was only a little larger which likely happened during extreme pain in October. Other lesion, same. A third lesion in front that I felt growing around mid-October is very small. Considering an ultrasound of supraclavical too. I am looking forward to someday having a PET CT and see what the SUV uptake is. Meantime I am doubling up on the stuff. And securing a new oncologist and the best therapy.",

Edited to add - Z net mind, I finally found it when there was a lengthy discussion back in May of this year. What I am most concerned about is the lung issue. And the new onc' s opinion that it will be of little effect for me. I'm looking for another choice, frankly. And I don't mean taxol infusion. Maybe faslodex revisited with ibrance. Since he has such a low hope of my survival then I think I should be able to choose whatever I want. Hope the new onc has great ideas.",

The doctor kept listing all the lymph nodes and nodules and lesions on the report and then in the impressions he would say \"likely due to progressive metastatic disease.\" Also right middle lung lobe is completely collapsed (used to be upper for 1 yr which recovered in autumn 2017) as is the bronchus to the middle lobe collapsed (not to be confused with main lung bronchus). What is good is there is very little increase in the 3 liver lesions. And the pain is only if I have done something to aggravate like bend over and brush the dog. Also there is a lymph node w cancer it seems abuting the carotid artery and paralysing my right vocal cord to boot. It that grows larger then I am scared of stroke. Some in ovary area, in kidney / adrenal..... I do not know when the this and thats grew but last PET CT was Oct 2, 2017. Could have been there then and not worth reporting due to size or SUV uptake. Because that is what was done in April 2016, got a gold star since report was so good and I took a break from tx for summer then found out in Oct 31 scan that they were all there but too small or too low SUV uptake to mention. I am 6 weeks off Xeloda which was not working. And two weeks on Aromasin. Not to take other tx until stronger, said new MO. See him on 25th.\" And that's all I got. Thinking of all you and the efforts and trials you are going through. Hope answers present themselves for every dilemma. Diane",

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2016 06:10PM - edited Nov 20, 2016 06:12PM by Bluebird-DE Thank you for the thread and info. I was on Faslodex for over two years. The cough was endless. Now, always I had a cough from laughing. I could have been dx w childhood asthma from having parents that smoked (windows up in car, two of them). But this turned to hell. I spent months blaming the Faslodex for the cough. I finally went off the Faslodex in Spring 2016 after a PET CT showed clear except one hilar node. I remained on Arimidex and had options to use Ibrance or other tx. The cough continued. EDIT: by the way, the Feb 2016 PET CT that showed clear is now highly in question bcz the Oct 2016 scan states MULTIPLE nodes in the (throat / thyroid region) are now INCREASED IN SIZE and GREATER ACTIVITY. This should have been reported and that is heartbreaking. So it was there before February! After a Spring, Summer, Autumn of chasing possibilities and making changes in my food, environment, practices, seeing too many doctors and asking for help way too often to NO avail. After all that, a PET CT scan was done and the cancer is in so many nodes and to liver. The cough and symptoms are likened to thyroid cancer - and the labs revealed nothing, no clue. If there is a cough, in hind sight, I say clearly, make them to an ultrasound and Xrays. I know the PET CT is only allowed on some insurances at 6-month intervals. As far as the medical profession, I was going to deal with my notes and feelings today but am defining the next move in treatment. This reminded me that even with Faslodex / bet inhibitor trial I am approved to enter on Tuesday, I cannot go on a tx that causes a cough. Will update and edit later. Thanks for hearing the partial fury that is in me.",

The mild soreness of elastic skirt band along the side too. When TX works, this is the first to respond. Cancer spread through all lymph nodes in bronchial, supra? clavical, neck, along esophagus. Tried to suffocate me really. Ended up with radiation twice so I could breathe. Now am on Xeloda, 2000 mg 2x day - 14 days on and 7 days off. Goal is 14 but I get to 10 and am done in. My oncologist is old school about the dose, he says the 14 is working and wants to stay on it, But frankly, and I told him, first cycle I wa on a titrated dose that slowly increased, never got over 3 pills twice a day. Next two cycles got me to 10 days each time. The next cycle I got to 14 days. Thought I would die on the next two days though off TX, then bounced back but barely to begin again. So fact is the CA markers were decreasing during the 10 day doses. This oncologist was a fill in until the new team arrives, holding out but glad he will be gone for my next visit. Hope the new team is all I hope for. I enjoy reading and learning, really appreciate what everyone shares, it all helps in so many ways. ",

My comment on this is oh bother !!!! So I am understanding a little more. That if they take a biopsy and test a tiny bit they will get one answer. But if they check another section there could and seems WOULD be even more mutations. So they don't really know what they are throwing the chemo at? And if I get another biopsy of a lymph node mass then it could come back different than the first from the lumpectomy. But actually all those cancer cells are still alive and well, they just found the other ones they didn't find the first check. Well so much for getting a new biopsy to make sure the right chemo drug is being used. What I have been on is working for now, or so it seems, sometimes I wonder and will have a scan - postponed until Oct 2 due to prednisone reaction. JFL - I'm sorry but this reminded me of 37 years ago. My sis and I went to Tennessee and we took rolls of film. But the film was all thrown out with the trash. The manager at film development station said the film was in a black plastic bag to go to the main center and the garbage was in a black plastic bag too, both by the door. Got to the center and the garbage was with her, someone had tossed the film in dumpster before she left the building. And that is just how easy it can be when professionals like in the cancer industry are not organized. Not saying your biopsy was tossed, I think it is at the other building.",

It is unfortunate the cancer clinics seem to be the busiest places in the entire world sometimes. Artist - I agree with Babs.

Since I started the raspberry powder and raw hemp oil I have not had liver pain at all and can sleep on my right side again. Before I begin the A/A combo I want to know what sizes the lesions are now compared to their big honking size on October 2. Inserted after I typed everything..... I'm sorry, I talk a lot when I type. Cannot speak much w this voice, so the words ran on. Shetland Pony --- Yes, have had lupus for about 25 years, photosensitivity to fluorescent lights and sun and even shade, the radiation cycles in spring sent me into flares like I have never had and there seemed to be no end for months. I received a letter from the rheumatologist today, all the mixed connective tissue disease is dormant now, seems the Xeloda helped that along. I don't want to do anything to excite it again. I was hoping if I did SIRT it would not be the same effect as radiation on the table. If I need to go that far. And yes, I am quite terrified to begin the Afinitor due to the lung inflammation and #5 fatalities I have read about on bco. And yes, I thought that being at the Goshen CC would be a step toward being treated as an individual but I am not seeing it so far. Have also been given a liquid dexamethasone which is a corticosteroid and wasn't told it would be in my protocol or why, they have to explain and especially since I have proven to be allergic to prednisone, severe rash, heart racing and a hint of trouble breathing and told them so and it is in writing in my file. Hubby picke RX up yesterday and I read all on it today. Very frustrated. I do have the liver biopsy results. And one reason I chose Goshen was for the genetic testing they have but it wa not set up yet. Thursday - it is on the list. Z ----- I also appreciate your details on the European trials that was posted by Lucia. On the TACE, I thought the same way, but I do know both the oncologists that chose the Afinitor/Aromasin wanted to do systemic and endocrine but the first also chose the tACE and I know I am in no physical condition to handle it. The second oncologist realized that, relief, but he did say since I had not been on any IV chemo yet that it was ridiculous to consider putting me through TACE. I just get in this whirlwind of confusion when that kind of contradiction is hurled at me, I left thinking good no TACE, then it took two weeks to say, wait a minute, IF I could do TACE this would be the time, not later. You are right, I am requesting the liver specialist for cancer there be consulted too. I see the nurse for labs on Thursday, the list of questions with a request for an appt is in the making. Thanks for the input. Lucia - what really jumped out at me from the post was there are only 154,000 American women/men with stage IV. To me it seems like hundreds of thousands more. Everyone- it is true, the stats become old every year, the new treatments make them obsolete and leave us more hopeful. The issue is finding the right ringer for each individual's treatment and a medical team that is open-minded and will not give up. Talk me down, I'm getting BUGGY!!! Tomorrow morning I will find out if I have hit a wall at Goshen. I chose Goshen since my center did not have a new team yet - 6 mo after the primary onc I have had from the beginning left for Alaska. I waited and then left. I am discouraged so far. So is Hubby, he was at the appt. After nearly a month of waiting for an appointment from my first call. I had the impression the med records would be gone over and I would get an appt asap due to severity of the case - in that I cannot walk much, breathe well and back then could not eat at all, lost 23 # in 3 weeks. Then it took another two + weeks to get the meds and training. There have been too many loops I have to go back and push them to deal with. Like not getting me the appt for training for the Afinitor. I had to make my own personal referral to the thyroid specialist / surgeon, the onc didn't see fit to get back to that on the first visit, though it was on the top of my list and my throat feels like it can close off too often to be calm. But I have an appt. I told him about the pneumonitis and asked if it is still there, no comment. I told him about the level 9 pain that radiates at the center of my spine then dissipates in 5 or so minutes, no comment. UGH!!! The onc also gave me the option of palliative care w a nursing team coming to the home OR Taxol 1x / week OR Aromasin/Afinitor. But no help at home IF I was getting more than palliative care. I was quite unhappy with him at first then realized it could be his way of saying he respects my wishes. Hubby and I are revisiting that one at the appt w him. He was direct when he asked if anyone had spoken to me about the seriousness of my condition. I said no, my doctors always know I am pro-active and they pat me on the back. He sent me to the counselor for a living will, but everyone gets that option they said. Enough bugging out, just wish it was time to leave for Goshen - was in bed 3 hrs and no sleep so up to stop wasting time.",

I am always re-learning how important it is to not only have the talking points and questions in the list for the doctors BUT to insist that list is thoroughly explored and you walk out of the office w answers, a plan and understanding of where that plan is taking you. Take an advocate that will help you, listen with you and while not antagonizing the doctor, ask the RIGHT questions and voice their concerns too. I am still better. My sense of smell has returned. It was gone for 3 months. Now everything is bothering me like when I felt decent. I am very touchy about smells. Taste, better. Hungry more often. Eating a lot of fruit in small portions, want fresh and cool stuff. Pain in liver so much less / maybe 90% on most days. Pain in right axillary, 80% less. Onward. My oncologist appt is bumped to 5 days sooner. I need to explore the carotid artery issue where the lymph node cancer doubled from Oct 5 to Jan 6. Oh, btw, the one in Oct was the same and NOT INCLUDED IN MY PET CT scan report. But was mentioned in the Jan CT report. Can anyone see the issue - possible stroke. imo. And I was in the MO's office when he had the contrast CT and this was not mentioned. So I am going back early. Also about the center right lung lobe being completely collapsed now, not the upper. And this is a good oncologist. I want so much for him to be a keeper. I know we have to bend and forgive and understand and work with the mistakes and oversights, I know that. That Kaylynne, that is the anger and frustration where there is no way to ever resolve it. They screwed up and won't admit it, none of the colleagues will throw them under the bus. And we have to find our answers and save our own arses without the full disclosure needed to do so. Never give up. It can be done. Right?",

So the SUV would be needed to show if the treatment is needed or not for that particular met anyway. My idea is with my history of PET / CT and the need to know the SUV then the next step would be a PET / CT for comparison and the CT w contrast is a waste of time AND A HUGE GAMBLE that the next treatment is going after lesions that are dead or dying. Am I better off to find an MO that is willing to do the PET / CT or am I mistaken in my judgements here? History focusing on liver. April 2016 PET / CT w minute seeds in liver which were not reported on this PET/ CT November 2016 PET / CT w liver lesions and SUV uptake. (started Ibrance/Femara) February 2017 PET / CT shows the lesions are down to seed size though still SUV uptake April 2017 PET / CT reveal liver lesions are almost gone. (Started Xeloda) July 2017 Ultrasound of liver shows nothing concerning October 2017 PET / CT reveal liver lesions are quite large and active November 2017 Ultrasound shows liver lesions have grown another cm each way. January 2018 CT w CONTRAST reveals liver lesions are the same size but smaller on one side, larger on other. (Started Aromasin) The onc I just left behind said only a CT w contrast so w could compare to the last. I say compare to October w anohter PET / CT.",

I told him that I was walking into the appointment with an open mind, whatever he said would sway me to go hospice or stay on palliative care. He said I look real good, better than they expected me to look from the last doc's notes. I am still palliative. My new protocol will build slowly, taking note of drug sensitivities. For today, faslodex was 250 and not 500. Soon add arimidex, metformin. Also he knows I am taking 1500 curcumin proprietary oil / day and some antioxidants, high dose. Z - you asked back 4 pages or so about liver swelling. I know when the lesions were growing in my liver it felt like a water balloon was under my skin on my side. Could be rubbed out, ugh. I thought it was water retained, but proved to be lesions. On my xray the notes said my right diaphragm was elevated. Of course, no one took note of that little problem. Then the liver lesions showed up on the PET CT. Kaption - we're in your pocket. ",
