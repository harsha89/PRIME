I tested positive as well. At first I was terrifed. I cried for months. Then I decided to make use of this knowledge. My family doctor told me to use this as a positive experience. That I have choices that others did not.   But after meeting over 10 specialists, plastic surgeons and genetic councellors I decided at age 40 to have an oopherectomy and mastectomy with implants. I wanted to reduce my risk as much as I possible can. I felt that a MRI along with mammography was a great alternative but I didn't make me feel safe. Again I felt that it would only tell me when the cancer arrived. Yes early detection is great but I did not want the cancer at all (early or not).  I discussed this long and hard with my husband and kids and decided to take action and do everything I could to significantly reduce my chances of breast and ovarian cancer.  It truly is a personal choice and  what could one can live with. Should i choose surveillance and then live everyday in fear or have the surgery and know that i did everything i could to prevent the big C. Take your time meet as many professionals as you can, meet with other who are BRCA  carriers, attend support groups, gather information as we know Knowledge is power.  Only you can make that call and do what you are comfortable with.",
