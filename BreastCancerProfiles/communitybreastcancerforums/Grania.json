We've been doing testing for over a year now, and nothing seems to give us an answer but we are still doing tests. Anyway, I'm trying to look over my symptoms and wanted to know about something... There is peau d'orange on my left breast that you can clearly see. However, it isn't really red or hot to the touch but when I touch the area it almost feels leathery. Does it feel the same way for others, or different? Log in to post a reply",
