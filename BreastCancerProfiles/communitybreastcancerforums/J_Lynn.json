After trying multiple psychiatrists for my depression and PTSD, I moved up a neuropsychiatrist who is the head of adult psychiatry at a major university hospital. Up till that time, I had been jumping from one antidepressant to another. Eventually, I read success stories about combining antidepressants, so I tried to convince my psydocs to try a combination. After working for a few weeks with my new psychiatrist, we came up with  a combination of two antidepressants that finally brought me out of a very deep depression and removed most of my brain fog, to boot.  Over the years, new meds have come out, and sometimes the meds I was on quit working. So, I have had several adjustments to my \"cocktail.\" These days, I feel pretty decent, considering the extent of my mets and my unpleasant prognosis. Some people are lucky; their depression goes away. Others, like me, are saddled with it for the rest of our lives. Either way, see the right doc for whatever illness you're fighting.",

Please, please se a psychiatrist any time you are feeling the symptoms of depression. I didn't, and that mistake caused me three months of pure h**l during my chemo.  Here's how it came about: The second time i had bc, I let my oncologist write my Prozac refills, instead of going to a specialist -- a psychiatrist. My onc, at the same time, prescribed Zofran for vomiting, which, like Prozac, is an SSRI. The result was an overdose of SSRIs, which caused me anguish and despair through 3 months of adriamycin/cytoxan, and contributed greatly to my worsening depression. When I described to my oncolgist my symptoms of serotonin syndrome, he just said that I was a \"very sensitive person, perhaps too sensitive.\" Then he said \"all i know to do is increase your Zofran.\" Of course, that just increased my load of SSRIs, and made my overdose even worse. If I had not dropped my psychiatrist for the duration of my cancer treatment, I would never have overdosed. Seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you're crazy. It means that you may have a problem with your brain chemicals. You seek her or his expertise to help you get the right medications in the right amount and the right dosages. This can take months because each change has to be done separately, so that its effect can be judged. The two of you will work as a team to find the best possible combinations of medicines to: lift your mood, improve your concentration and motivation, minimize side effects, and avoid toxic combinations of drugs. Would you let your oncologist or your primary doctor do your back surgery? manage your severe heart disease? would you let them guide you through a complex, difficult pregnancy? Of course not. You would ask for a referral to a specialist for each of these problems. So, for depression, please go to a specialist in that field -- a psychiatrist. I thought I that seeing a psychiatrist throughout my surgery & chemo would just complicate matters. Quite the opposite happened. I lost 3 months of my life to the anguish of an drug interaction, and thanks to PTSD, I sometimes relive my memories of the brutal overdose.",
