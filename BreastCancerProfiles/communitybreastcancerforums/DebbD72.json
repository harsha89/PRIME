My skin feels irritated and I have been using the aloe from the leaf. I drink tons of water and I am drinking a Nutri-Bullet in the morning with coconut water, berries, banana and kale. I thank you for the info about the Aquaphor. I have used it on my daughter who is 4, but I will ask my RO if it is ok for me to use as well. My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive so I had a feeling this would happen. So far energy level is great. I am helping coach my daughter's T-Ball team and threw a baseball for the first time since my surgery today. It felt GREAT! Good luck ladies on your journey! We can do it!!! <3 :-)",
