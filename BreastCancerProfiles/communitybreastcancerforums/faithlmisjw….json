I opted for mastectomy since the size of my DCIS was quite large (5 cm).  No radiation for me.  Nowdays, I see my oncologist twice a year since I am on Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I did went back to see my surgeon once since I found another lump near the surgical area, it turned out to be scar tissues.  Take care of yourself.",
