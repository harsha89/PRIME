    "Content": "athecai wrote: So, a little background, I\u2019m 24 and no family history of breast cancer, but some weird stuff has been happening to my left breast that have been spiking my anxiety. First, over the summer, I had a small rash on my breast, and went to Planned parenthood. She did a full breast exam and had me do some creams. After a week of hydrocortisone and a week of an antifungal, it went away and it\u2019s been gone for 4 months. but but in july i found a lump, one that the doctor didn't find or seem to be worried about (this lump also dissappears when i lay down and i can only feel it if i'm sitting up). it's about the size of a grape, and so i just went in to get it checked this week. she felt it and said it felt like a gland to her, since it wasn't hard or immobile (it is firm, though)but there's really nothing else like that on my other breast? this breast also gets sore and tender and hurts around my period while my other one doesn't? the doctor who examined me is still doing her residency so i'm not sure if i should get an opinion from someone with more experience? should i be worried? she said to come back in january and if i had any changes are concerning pain she'd plan a mammogram. so with this lump and the mystery rash its just got me panicked.
