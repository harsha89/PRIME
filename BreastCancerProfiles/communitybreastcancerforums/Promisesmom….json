I am in no way attached to these itty bitties 😂 I just want to feel better.  Regardless of all this im overdue for a checkup at the gyno. I think the last time i went I had just had my son.. So about 3 1/2 years ago.  Thank you for your response. I have a friend who is a doctor in germany and she told me that fatigue isn't a symptom, but like you are saying, it seems as though the people diagnosed on this forum seemed to have fatigue for a while before diagnosis.",

I'm actually not really a worrier, so I just put the appt in my phone and will get an alert the night before to remind me.. I figure there's no use worrying about something I know nothing about. Just keeping an eye on it, feeling it daily to see if I feel growth or any pain, etc.. but nothing's changed so far. Same size, still no pain. I try just to think logically in the midst of everything and that really helps. Though gut feelings are important to me too, and my husbands gut feelings are normally spot on and he said to get it checked, so I am 💓 I figure I've been through alot on my life- and if I have lived through all of that, I can live through whatever this is too. Feeling better would definitely be a bonus though! ",

He did a normal pelvic exam and touched both my breast for maybe 3 seconds each and was like ok, let's see you in 6 months... I blurted out- you know I wouldn't have came here today if it wasn't for my husband pushing me to come here. He says it does not feel normal. I was irritated.. he barely touched my breasts over my shirt... However to my surprise, he turns around and says.. your husband suggested you come! Can you show me where he felt it? So I showed him and he says, \" it feels like normal tissue to me.. but it makes a big impact on me when someone who obviously touches your breasts often notice a difference\" (I'm sitting there in my head going.... Yeah.. me.. but alright, I guess my husband noticing is a bigger deal?!?! Wtf?!) \"So I'm sending you for an ultrasound. My last 2 patients that had husbands that swore it felt different actually had breast cancer when I didn't feel anything. So I'm going to trust your husband on this.\"  First of all.. why not trust the patient? Why does my husband's word veto mine? I mean I'm happy that I got an ultrasound.. but I'm so frustrated that he feels that my husband's voice is bigger than mine- as if he knows my body better than myself...?! What is that shit? Sorry.  Anyways, I have a ultrasound tomorrow at 10am. I will let y'all know what they say. ",

But like you said.. I never thought that literally being tapped like one would do with that tool on the knee 3 times around each breast would even suffice as a breast exam. 😂 I was so lucky I made that comment or my husband would have ended up back at the doctor's office throwing a fit demanding a US or mammo lol. He's pretty adament. I mean I'm just happy I got the US. I was talking to a lady at the women's center and she was like \"Find a lump?\" I said \"yea..\" she says \"your lucky that your doctor sent you in and listened. Alot of the docs around here (small town) dismiss young girls when they say they have a lump. My daughter was one of them. She actually died because nobody listened and we just didn't have the money to come out of pocket for the exams, so we found out too late. So here I am. Glad your getting it checked. My guess is your doc wouldn't give you a mammogram huh?\" I said, \"No, he said I was too young and an ultrasound would suffice.\" She said \"If you can afford it, do thermography and 3D ultrasound too.\" She then got called back. What is thermography and why would she suggest a 3d mammo? I'm hoping that the US will suffice and everything is good. My doc said it will take about 2 weeks to get the results back especially with the holidays. Bella- you are right though. I totally felt dismissed. I remember when I was nursing, my doc would take her time feeling when I had mastitis but wanted to make sure i didn't have any masses. Sent me in for an US just to be sure because one duct was super inflamed. I loved her. She always took time and listened. I hope to find a doctor like her again. It sucks to be dismissed and to only be listened to because i mentioned my husband finding it odd.🤷",

They test me for drugs to find out I'm clean.. my last doc even went so far as to say I had an eating disorder, to which I laughed and said I eat everything in sight.. so she referred me to a psychologist and nutritionalist 🤦. I never went. I just logged my food intake from then on, only to figure out I was eating enough to supposed to be putting 2 lb a week on me.. but still a year later.. im 87 lbs.. alot of doctors don't take me seriously and it sucks. I did finally go to an endocrinologist about a year ago who just wanted to do a excisional biopsy on my groin lymph nodes, just to see.. but there was nothing in the findings. He was thinking lymphoma l. So I gave up after that thinking.. well, I guess it's just normal to feel like this and I'm just having psychosomatic symptoms or something 🤷 So I just have been treading on until finding this lump. Even then, I wasn't even going to make an appt, but my husband pushed 🙈 Either way it goes it would be nice to find out why I feel the way I do. I've watch a few videos on how to feel the difference between malignancy and just normal tissue or cysts and it does fit the bill on malignancy.. however I like to think positive thoughts regardless and not worry. So I'm not worrying myself until there's something to worry about, if I even do that..  So what's the best tests? I have very small boobs so i kinda wondered how they would even do a mammogram. They are almost flat.. though the one with the lump is almost a size bigger than the other now. So a AA and an A. I assume they will want to do an ultrasound and if there's any abnormal findings, fine needle aspiration or something?",

I put myself into remission with cannabis that I take nightly ( a protocol one of my old doctors figured out.. epigeneticists are awesome!)
