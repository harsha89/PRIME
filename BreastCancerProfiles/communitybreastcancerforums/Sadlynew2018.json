      "Content": "Sadlynew2018 wrote: hello everyone! Hoping someone could lend some guidance or insight into what I'm experiencing. Last Thursday, I had my second weekly infusion of taxol. Didn't have any allergic reactions during the infusion. Starting last week, I had shortness of breath and as the days passed, my chest felt tighter and I had upper back pain. Yesterday, I felt like I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER this morning. They gave me a full workout. CT of chest was clear. I go for a heart stress test in the morning. I'm reading the symptoms of allergic reactions to taxol and I feel like I have them, except delayed? I'm 41 and never had back pain in my life. The pain I feel in my back is excruciating. The doctors can't figure out what's wrong between my chest and my back.
