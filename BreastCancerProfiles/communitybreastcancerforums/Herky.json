Everything else feels good - I got great results from the pathology report and now will have to meet with a few different docs to determine if I'll need radiation because there was only a small margin between the DCIS and the pectoral muscle. I'm hoping I won't need radiation, but I guess I'll have to do what I have to do. I hope you are all doing well and healing nicely - best wishes!",

I'm going to use your supply list to go shopping before my surgery (I'm having a BMX with TE on 2/9). I guess constipation is a problem with surgery in general because I was the same way after my c-sections. Prune juice helps alot too - just don't drink too much of it! Also, my PS said to get a wedge pillow with arms so you can keep your arms slightly elevated - I found one online at Target for about $20, so I'm going to give that a try. Best of luck to everyone!",

I barely felt anything when they pulled out the other thing. I was also fortunate that volunteers at the hospital made pouches that went around my neck and held the drains so I could take a shower with them. The best part about this has been seeing how many people I don't even know have taken the time to do something nice that has made this all just a little bit easier. I only hope that when I'm feeling up to it I'm able to return the favor.",

I really didn't want radiation, but want to do everything I can to reduce my risk of coming back. They said my risk of recurrence wasn't very high (maybe 4-6%), and they wanted to have the option of doing radiation in the future if I should have a recurrence. Everything was non-invasive, so they won't do any chemo and I'm ER/PR negative, so no hormone therapy either. So I guess that's it for me - other than reconstruction. It's so weird. This all happened so fast - everything since my mammogram on 1/7/11 - that it's like I'm just now starting to process all of it. I feel guilty for not having to have to go through chemo and radiation like so many others. Like I don't deserve to be considered a cancer survivor because I don't belong in the same category as all of the strong women who have endured so much and are going through so much now. I have decided that there are many more positives than negatives to come from all this though. Yes, I lost my breasts and I've had the pain from surgery and recovery, not to mention a very stressful few months waiting to figure out my final diagnosis and treatment, but I've also become closer to my husband, closer to my mother who has breast cancer, closer to my sister who traveled half way across the country to take care of me and my two little girls for 10 days while I recovered from surgery, and closer to my friends who steped up to support and help me and my family. I've had strangers reach out to me and help me and my family through this and I'll never forget their kindness. I've met some wonderful women on this forum that have comforted me and educated me more that I could have ever imagined. I've made new friends that I hope to have for a lifetime. I feel like I owe a debt - a huge one - and I owe it to all who have come before me and all who will come after. Now I need to find a way to pay it back.",

Cameron - Thanks for the advice. I was a bit worried about picking her up but got the ok from my PS before doing so. I've been taking it easy and only lift her when I have to and only for short periods of time (like just to get her into her high chair or into bed). I still have lots of help around the house, so I really don't do it unless I have to. XmasDX - congrats on your surgery. I had orignally planned on having my DH go home for the night, but once I realized that I couldn't reach anything or pick anything up myself I quickly changed my mind. It's good advice no matter what unit you're in to have someone stay the night if possible.",

My husband and I already had a trip planned when I was diagnosed and were going to cancel it, but I'm so glad we didn't.

He gave me meds through the IV and a patch behind my ear and I never threw up or even felt like I was going to. The doctor did an SNB and only removed two nodes which both cam back negative, so I'm really excited about that. I shoud get results from the final pathology on Monday. All in all, I\"m feeling pretty good and I'm able to get up and walk around as I feel like it. Wishing you all the best!

There was a narrow margin near the pectoral muscle and I'll have to get some other opinions as to whether it would be  a good idea to do radiation or something in that area just to be safe, but for the most part I'm done. Just need to do the reconstruction and move on. I keep feeling like I have to find some sort of positive out of this. Like I need to use this experience to help someone else.

I really hope everyone is doing well and making it through this month. Next month will be better, right? Personally, I'm just happy to have it over with. I had a wonderful sister that lives out of town come stay with me for the past 10 days and it has been such a blessing - so sad to see her leave today though. Her presence really helped heal me inside and out. Anyways, does anyone else totally not remember anything from the first week? At the time I thought and felt I was totally lucid, but now don't remember anything. Like my husband keeps telling me about all these friends that stopped over to drop off food and I seriously don't remember them even being here, let alone talking to them. Strangely, I do remember eating the food. LOL. I also don't remember much about the hospital stay except that my husband brought me Twizzlers (my favorite treat) and I kept falling asleep while eating them. There were several occasions where I'd wake up with a half eaten Twizzler in my hand and partially chewed Twizzler in my mouth. Horrible. Once a nurse came in and woke me up to take my vitals and couldn't take my temp because I had a Twizzler in my mouth. I also didn't remember my husband staying the night with me at the hospital - I swore I sent him home. I apparently flashed my sister and made her look at the stiches when I first saw her - who knows who else I did that to! I think I may have some apology emails to write.",
