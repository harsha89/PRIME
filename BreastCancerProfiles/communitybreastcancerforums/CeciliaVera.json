Thanks in advance!

It also allows others to take on as much or as little detail as they wish: I give someone a very general version of what was going on, usually via email as that felt the most comfortable, and then refer them to the blog if they want \"the long version.\"  Good luck figuring out what is right for you. One thought: when people know at least something, even if it is just that you are going through some health issues, they are more likely to be gentle with you.  That might be a help.  Take care!      ",

Anyway, I think I am supposed to be massaging or manipulating the scars. Can anyone describe that, or point me to a resource?

Just...how are you handling all of it?  I think I am still a little tired from rads; when I overdo it or get worn out, it's like someone pulls a plug on my energy and patience, and I get really crabby.  When people who are trying to be supportive talk about how I'm all done or cured, it rubs me the wrong way.  A couple family members told me they kept forgetting I had cancer, which I think was meant to be a comment on my supposed strength, but if they read my blog, they would know what is really on my mind, and I am not that stoic at all. I should feel fortunate that I am still here and that all is going well.  I do feel fortunate, but there is a tangle of other emotions, too, and I don't have anyone quite right to talk with. I have made a few changes to treat myself and my body a little better: I started writing again, I am going to take a class solely for my own personal enrichment, and I am working on changing my diet (I am conscientious and careful, but of course there is room for improvement). How are YOU doing?  Sound off here about your worries or fears, and/or tell the rest of us how you vent, what you're learning or changing, and how to stay upbeat if you are.  Thanks and good luck!
