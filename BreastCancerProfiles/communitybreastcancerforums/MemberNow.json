Had lumpectomy last month and all set to start chemo tomorrow. I have a little less than 2 year old who caught a bad virus of cold and flu from his daycare since Friday and I now started feeling the symptoms of flu - sore throat, heavy head, congestion etc. We have to leave our son with my parents and he is so clingy, and now I'm not sure my treatment starts tomorrow owing to my symptoms. Feeling terrible either way. :( ",

I had the port insertion done today and they had to go for a couple of attempts before they got it right. They couldn't find the vein on first attempt, and it all got delayed and went on till evening. And I actually developed cough by now and my MO said he would monitor and decide tomorrow morning to start or to postpone for a week.",
