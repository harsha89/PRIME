    "Content": "cimiche wrote: Hi...  I had a bilateral DIEP April 5th.  I still have an abdominal drain in! And it is still draining significantly. I got a stomach bug (again) yesterday, and when I woke up this morning the drain was empty! I was so happy.  Well, it started draining right away, and just today, I have drained nearly 300 cc's!  10 times the amount that it needs to be to have it removed. My other drain broke loose and fell out 10 days ago.  The stitch has broken loose on this drain, but it is taped in. When I went to my PS on Friday, she said she could stitch it back in... I declined.  Just didn't want it to hurt! The tape is working effectively, and I guess it is draining so much that it is good that it is in.  Has anyone else had a drain in for so long???   Dx 12/10/2009, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
