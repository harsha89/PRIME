The first few days are surreal. Try to have someone with you at appointments if you can - it's really hard to process all the information when you are still dealing with the shock of the diagnosis. The worst part is really right after the diagnosis - when you don't know what you're dealing with, don't know what's going to happen, and you fear the worst. God bless you, Karen",

Although grade 3 does mean it is aggressive, your tumor size is very small (2.6 mm) and that's a good thing - it means you caught it early. Your radiologist is right - it is typical for it to take a couple weeks from diagnosis to surgery. They have to get the pathology reports back, do MRIs, etc. You may want to start thinking about the pros/cons of lumpectomy vs mastectomy, so you can ask your medical team the appropriate questions. They can't stage it until after the surgery. These early days when you don't know what's going to happen are the worst. It's easy for your imagination to run to the worst case scenario. It does get easier once the treatment actually starts. Hang in there and use these boards to get the support you need. Karen",

And it is lonely - unless someone has had cancer, they just don't understand what it is like to have it hanging over your head. I had a friend try to assure me that I am well now. The trouble is, I will never be sure that I am well, and I will just have to learn to live with that uncertainty. I think no one really gets that ( I did not understand it either until I was diagnosed, so I don't really fault them). Like Cyndi, I know people who do everything WRONG and are just as healthy as can be. It's learning to live with unfairness that is difficult.

Stage 0 (DCIS) is considered pre-invasive, so a less aggressive treatment may be needed than if it turned out to be IDC. The MRI combined with the mammo, ultrasound, and biopsy give them as much information as possible prior to surgery, so then can have some idea of what they are dealing with, but there are no guarantees they won't find something different once they operate. It's just the way it is. I understand your feelings about not wanting to have two surgeries, but the alternative is to do a mastectomy when it may not be necessary. How long it takes to get MRI results varies depending on your center. Mine were back two days later. The surgeon told me it was my decision: lumpectomy + rads, or mastectomy. I chose to do the lumpectomy because I just was not psychologically ready to remove my breast unless I absolutely had to. Some people prefer to do the mastectomy. It's a tough decision. Wishing you the best as you go through this process. There is a thread for DCIS - you might want to look at it. Karen",

My medical oncologist wanted me to go ahead and start and the radiation oncologist said it was fine with her, so I've already been on it a couple weeks. From some of your postings, it looks like I owe a big thanks to my surgeon. I have no recall of the injection for the sentinel lode biopsy.

I remember nothing after that until I woke up and the surgeon was standing over me in his street clothes, telling me I could go home as soon as I could sit up.

Quite frankly, I couldn't do it, which is why I ended up with the Boost. I did feel better when I ate more protein, but I'm not much on meat and there's only so many nuts and beans a person can eat! Your center will likely have a dietician on staff - you might want to ask to meet with her/him and get some good advice about diet. I know they will tell you that they do NOT want you to be losing weight while going through treatment. Your body really needs a tremendous amount to help heal - radiation is a significant assault on it. Patty, Marilyn, and Julie - Congratulations to all of you! I hope everyone has a wonderful week!

One perk, though - for the first time in 37 years, I had no period this month! WooHoo! Hope that is IT for periods! I don't know if the protocol involves Metformin in addition to Tamoxifen or instead of it. There is a study posted somewhere on these threads that describes pretty impressive outcomes for Metformin at shrinking tumors and reducing recurrence (in both hormone positive and negative women, I think). Patty - the study is looking at both hormone positive and negative - I think they're just hoping it will be another tool in the arsenal for hormone negative women, who have fewer options than those of us who are hormone positive.

For those of you who are getting ready to start Tamoxifen: there are a BUNCH of medications you cannot take while on Tamoxifen, because they stop Tamoxifen from working.

On the August Tamoxifen thread, one of the women posted a link to a site that tells you what you can and cannot take.

I'm fine with seeing the med onc every 3 months, but really don't see why I need to keep seeing the rad onc and the surgeon. Donna - glad to hear you're healing. Linda - the party sounds great! Glad to hear you can eat again Julie - glad to hear the acupuncture is helping. Brenda - congrats on getting to shave again! My doc gave me permission to start shaving and using deodorant once I switched to the boosts.  I was so excited - hard to believe such a little thing could matter so much. Karen",

The boost area is kind of nasty looking (especially where I had to peel off the stickers - skin came with it), but the rest of my breast isn't looking half bad. I am having some rib pain, that started following a coughing fit last night. I really hope I have not cracked a rib. I know they are prone to breaking easily for the next couple years. Has anyone read the book Anticancer? I bought it last night. It is an excellent book - research-based and focuses on what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer, with particular emphasis on diet. To those of you still going through treatment - hang in there - an end is in sight! Hope everyone enjoys a treatment-free weekend! Karen",

I basically just threw into a pot everything I could imagine putting in one pot that was listed as an anticancer drug. This included about half a head of cabbage (the most I could fit into the pot), a large tomato, a bunch of carrots, some chicken bullion, a little V8 juice, a clove of garlic, some turmeric, and black pepper. I started out kind of light on the turmeric and black pepper, but the soup was kind of bland, so I added more. I added the V8 juice because of the blandness, also and it did seem to help. I just let it simmer until the cabbage was cooked. Next time I think I'll add in onions, too. I'm planning on making myself some kind of healthy soup once a week and taking it to work during the week for lunch.

Last week at work, my eyesight went dim for about two hours. It was like someone had turned the lights down (so much so I had a coworker come check my office to see if there was something wrong with the lighting). I tried telling myself it was just some sort of weird migraine symptom. Then the pain I've had in my leg got MUCH worse this weekend. I took off work today (something I never do), but my oncologist did not have any open appointments. So stupidly, I went to the emergency room. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME! They told me I did not have a DVT (but no ultrasound to actually check for it). The physician's assistant kept telling me I had no risk factors for a DVT and I had to keep telling her I was on Tamoxifen. They did an x-ray and told me my leg was not broken (I never thought it was). When I kept trying to explain to them that I thought it might be mets, they told me it couldn't be because the x-ray was fine (think it takes a bone scan to answer that question). They did NOTHING to check about why I had the episode of dimness, basically telling me it was probably nothing. She ended up saying I probably had shin splints in my right leg. Oh, and I had a fever and they made no comment whatsoever about that. I think I walked away from the experience realizing not to really on medical professionals who are NOT oncologists to be able to separate out what is a worrisome symptom and what isn't. I have an appointment Wed with the breast surgeon and with the oncologist next week - guess I'll wait until I see someone who knows what they're doing and see what they say about it. I honestly felt like I knew more about cancer symptoms and diagnosis than the ER staff (and maybe by now I actually do). I still feel FAR away from a new normal. On the bright side, all the stress of this weekend (my transmission on my car went out, also), finally caused me to have the meltdown that's been building for four months. I've spent the better part of the past two days crying, but I think I really needed to do that. The sharp pains and weird underarm feelings come and go. Some days are fine, some days it hurts like after the surgery. Guess everything is still trying to heal, Have a nice evening, Karen",

I think I've reached the point that the DREAD of mets may be getting worse than dealing with reality. Julie - I agree, you should demand a bonescan. If your doctor is good, though, you probably won't have to fuss too much to get it. I was all prepared to have to argue my point and I didn't at all - he agreed with me. It's hard to know which \"aches\" we're supposed to worry about and which ones we can ignore! I LOVED your comment about testicles - too true! Have a great time at the Bed and Breakfast :) Brenda - I can relate to feeling like more of an observer than a participant. I feel like I put on a facade to get through my work day, and I'm so worn out from doing so that I just kind of crash when I come home. I'm not socializing much - just shut myself in my house, put on comfy clothes, and do Sudoku puzzles. Right now, I think it's what I need to do to heal. I agree that yoga would be helpful. I used to take yoga classes regularly, and particularly liked Restorative Yoga. Chicago - I had a lumpectomy. It was the one easy part of this whole process. The surgeon did a GREAT job (as he tells me himself, whenever he sees me!) If it weren't for the scars you would really not be able to tell that I had a chunk cut out (there is a slight outward turn to my nipple now, but nothing really obvious). Donna - NED stands for \"no evidence of disease\". Not as comforting a phrase as \"cured\" unfortunately. Tracye - UGGHHH - I'm so sorry about the cyst and polyp - it's hard after what we've been through to assume that anything is okay. My friends keep trying to assure me that my cancer has NOT metastasized. I have one coworker who has survived prostate cancer - when I told him I was having a bonescan, he immediately gave me a hug and told me to let him know if he needed anything. It was very comforting because he GOT IT, without me having to explain it to him - he understands what a stage IV diagnosis means and how frightening it is to have to go through these tests, not knowing what the outcome is going to be. I'll be sending you positive thoughts for your biopsy. I think you should forward the results to your oncologist - the more informed he/she is, the better care they can provide. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend - this is just such a nasty disease. I'm so glad you all have become my friends, even if we never meet in person! It helps SOOO much to have you there, Karen",

As to your question about whether we are \"in remission\", there was a really good thread on that just recently (some people got a bit hot over it, though). My friends and family are avoiding the entire topic so thoroughly that I've never had to explain it to anyone. They are prefer to pretend I just stubbed my toe or something. I think you can get lymphedema even if they only took two nodes. I had two episodes in which my arm swelled - one the day right after surgery, and one about four weeks into radiation. Both times, though, the swelling went away on its own (I only had one node removed). Brenda - sorry to hear about your mom needing surgery :( I have found that I get overwhelmed easily by some things and don't give a crap about others, and it's not always predictable which way it's going to go.

I like to look through old magazines, and I will sometimes look at the year and wonder did I have cancer then and just not know it? I wish I knew what I could blame it on, because then maybe I could control it. The lack of control is disturbing. I have not yet gotten all that angry, but I know it's coming - just another stage in recovering from this nightmare. Tracye - I don't talk to too many people about my fears of recurrence. I have one friend I talk to some, but I never tell him just how much it scares me. Have you made an appointment with your doctor yet? B - Like you, I vacillate between normal and fragile. I am having more \"normal\" days than in the past, but I'm still far from where I used to be. I'm really struggling with making signficant life decisions (like whether to move, whether to stay at my job), because I'm afraid I won't have the time to fix a mistake if I make one. In the past, I would tell myself my decisions were not irrevocable, and I could change my mind. Now I feel pressured to make perfect decisions.",

Low oncotype means no chemo, high means you have to have chemo. However, if it is HER2 Neu + they always do chemo and don't bother with getting the oncotype. The oncotype is expensive (about $3000), but more insurance companies are paying for it, because it can save them a large amount of money if no chemo is needed. I didn't even meet with an oncologist to discuss the possibility of chemo until after the surgery - I think that's fairly standard procedure. Thinking of you, Karen",

So now I have to find a time to reschedule it that does not disrupt my work schedule too much and WAIT to find out what is wrong. I am not that freaked out by the idea of cataracts, as I am by the thought of \"what if it's NOT cataracts??\" My mind would have always gone to the \"bad place\", but with my coworker with the brain tumor, my mind is much quicker to head to the bad place. I had a spell earlier today where I felt a bit out of it and everything seemed kind of far away. Needless to say, I started googling brain metastasis and then I really freaked out. However, the feeling passed and I was able to reason with myself that this meant it was more likely a blood sugar issue than a brain tumor issue. I wish I could see a dizzy spell as just a dizzy spell, and not evidence of doom and gloom.  I am also a bit freaked out about what's going to happen if I have to go off the Tamoxifen because it's causing cataracts. I am not okay with not being on an anti-hormonal medication, but I don't want to get my ovaries out either. Not all that thrilled with the option of a monthly Lupron shot, but looks like that is the best choice. Trish - hope your appointment went well (I think it was today??) Karen",

Since I am premenopausal, Tamoxifen is the only hormonal I can take. BUT, if we shut down my ovaries, I could take one of the AIs. Lupron is a monthly shot that keeps your ovaries from working. I'm too afraid to NOT take something. I don't know if I could keep up the Lupron thing for another 4 years, 4 months, but I think I could make it for a year or so, which would be better than nothing. I first have to see whether I really am developing cataracts, then see what the oncologist wants to do. How did your appointment go??",

I know they wanted me to start radiation as soon as I had healed enough from the surgery to do it. Still, I would think later would be better than not at all, since radiation's goal is to zap any cells that are hanging around. I am considering starting a Tai Chi class in January. My gym is offering one, and I thought it might be good for me. I usually love yoga to calm down, but in the city I now live in, they try to teach yoga classes as if they are aerobic classes - so they're not really calming and soothing.

My check engine light came on Friday evening (and I've had three expensive car repairs in 2 months) and instead of freaking out about it, I took it to the mechanic first thing Saturday, without completely wigging out. I've actually been crying a lot more (ever since Elizabeth Edwards died) and I think it's a good thing - I'm finally letting myself grieve over the whole thing. I'm even starting to feel grateful for Tamoxifen, instead of resenting it. I'm now GLAD to have something I take everyday that is hopefully keeping the nasty little cells at bay (along with the aspirin, fish oil, multivitamin, vitamin D, etc.) If I hear something MIGHT reduce a risk of recurrence, I add it in.

She told me that when mammos are done this soon out after radiation that they nearly always come back BIRADS 3 - which also made me feel better. I dread these follow-up visits, but always feel relieved afterwards when they don't find anything wrong. One more visit with the medical oncologist later this month and then the only doctor I need to see for the next couple months is my dentist (and who knew I'd find a dental appointment to be a relief and nothing to fear??)",

Even those who try to be supportive don't really get how life-altering this has been - and some of my friends and family didn't even TRY to be supportive - they just disappeared on me. I'm still really struggling with \"what next\". I am considering moving to the place I grew up (I moved to the town I currently live in a few years ago for a job, but I've never been completely satisfied living here). I had always thought I would probably move home when I retired, but now I don't know that I want to wait for something that may never happen. I'm fearful of making the wrong decision, though, and have lost all confidence in making the right one. I'm trying to move forward with my life, but I feel like I just want to hide because I keep expecting something bad to happen. I did go shopping today and bought myself some new things, including a raincoat. It was more expensive than I would usually have bought (I'm very cheap), but I figured what the heck. If I get sick again, I'll regret not buying the raincoat, so I went ahead and bought it. So far the only \"good\" thing that's come out of having cancer is I'm treating myself a bit better. I'm still waiting for all the great philosophical insight that supposed to come from confronting your own mortality! I've also found myself monitoring the health of others who have cancer, and it feels like a personal loss when something happens. I don't even LIKE Michael Douglas, but I'm still rooting for him. It's like we all have a shared trauma AND a shared bond. I'm so glad you're all here - can't imagine trying to work through this all on my own. Karen",

The last thing I remember is saying yes, I did want something to relax, and the next thing I knew was the surgeon standing over me telling me it was finished and I could go home. The oddest part is the wire localization, if you have to have that. It's not painful (done with lidocaine), but is a bit weird to have a piece of wire coming out of your skin.

I didn't feel quite that strong and amazing. I was scared and overwhelmed, despite \"only\" being Stage 1. I continued to work for the simple fact that I HAD to - I'm single, and if I don't work, I don't eat (and don't have health insurance). I was fortunate to have a very good employer, but I also know of people whose employers try to get rid of them, or who have jobs that make it difficult to work, even if they are Stage 1 or Stage 0. I was in fairly good health going into this, but I can honestly say I would NOT have been able to work 8 hours on an assembly line while going through radiation (and fortunately I had a job that is physically easy). And there's really no way to predict who is going to have an easy time of a particular treatment and who is not. My surgery went like a dream - as easy as it possibly could have been. Radiation, nowhere near as easy as I had been led to expect. I do NOT doubt that Stage IV is much worse than Stage 0 or Stage 1, but early stages are no walk in the park either. I was diagnosed 4 months ago and told I had an excellent prognosis - and today I had a bone scan to see if it has progressed. I won't know the results until early next week when I find out whether I am still Stage 1, or have jumped to Stage IV. And ALL cancer patients have to live with that reality - they may only be early stage until the next scan causes the other shoe to drop. It's not a \"suffering contest\". Cancer sucks for all of us. We need to have compassion for one another. I understand to some degree where Molly is coming from. I find myself feeling resentful toward healthy people. I have to remind myself that it is NOT their fault that I am sick and they are healthy. It is just the luck of the draw. Resentment can really be toxic. Karen",

I think the radiation is making me moodier, too, because I'm so tired that it's really hard to take care of things (and harder to put on the facade that I'm doing well). Everyone tells me what a good attitude I have, but none of them understand that I'm still scared to death, and don't know when if ever I will quit being scared to death. I am prepared for the real emotional part of the healing to start in the fall, once radiation is over and I finally get to start to heal physically.

Sorry Julie - I know you've had it with that word :) Julie - I never developed a cough, but I was warned that I might because a small part of my left lung was in the radiation field. The doctor assured me that if I did get a cough, it would go away. Kim - sorry you're having so much trouble with itchiness. Susan - like you, I have just begun to process this whole experience. I expect it to be a LONG process, too. Spendygirl - I did not take any pictures of my breast - I figure my oncology and radiology team took MORE than enough of those :) One more day and then we get a radiation-free weekend. Hang in there!

I worry almost obsessively about mets - not so much about a \"regular\" recurrence, because I could handle that, but I'm scared to death of metastasis. I think the worst part is that they cannot tell us with confidence that the cancer is ALL gone. I've had a pain in my right leg for about two months, and sometimes I am absolutely convinced it's mets, and other times (my saner times) I think it's just arthritis being aggravated by Tamoxifen. When I'm busy in the daytime it's not quite so bad, but at night I really worry. Like you, Kim, I find myself almost \"preparing\" for it (not that you can even prepare for it).  I also read the Stage IV forums and look for people who started out Stage 1 (which I know is not good for me to do, but I can't quite stop myself). I'm just hypervigilant and I almost feel like if I am super-informed, that I can somehow outwit the cancer. Not logical, I know, but I guess it's just part of the healing process. Maybe in a few months we will all be doing better both physically and psychologically. I do like the idea of a trip to Vegas, though (or a trip to anywhere for that matter). Karen",

Kim - what a stupid comment that woman made - you should have looked at her seriously and said, \"Oh, did your breasts try to kill you, too?\" I met with the surgeon today. He was not pleased at the poor care at the ER, and he ordered an ultrasound (to rule-out a DVT), and a bone scan (to rule-out mets). He was both reassuring and concerned. He told me my prognosis was still excellent, but that they need to find out why I keep getting sick (running a fever all week) and am in pain (I've also lost my appetite - that's been an issue for weeks). The tests are Friday. He also scheduled my mammogram for two months out - on BOTH breasts! When I asked whether it would be on both, he looked at me like it was a crazy question and said, \"of course\". Hugs to all, Karen",

I have managed to keep myself off the stage IV threads, but I sometimes get pulled into things on Active Topics that I would be better off avoiding. I think we're all trying to find that perfect balanace - being aware of cancer, but not letting it rule our lives. I feel like I'm still on a teeter-totter: I either don't think about it at all, or feel overwhelmed by it - I just have not yet found much balance. I feel like I'm starting to get there, but still have a ways to go. Has anyone made major changes in their lives as a result of all this - I mean like quitting a job, moving, changing a relationship, etc? I now feel like I've let work become WAY too central in my life, and am considering trying to go to part-time within the next couple years (would have to pay off some debt and move to a cheaper house, also). Anybody else considering changing things? So glad you're all here - can't imagine going through this without you! Karen",

Found myself making future-oriented plans for the first time since diagnosis. Today, my mood absolutely crashed and I have walked around all day absolutely convinced that the pain I have in my right shin is mets. I've tried reasoning with myself, tried keeping myself busy, tried going to bed early hoping to sleep it off. Finally got up and got on this site, and there your postings were. It's nice to know I'm not the only one worrying about this. I don't fear recurrence in general: I know I can handle it if it is a local recurrence to a breast. But Stage IV frightens me and I don't know that I could handle that. No matter how much I tell myself that it is very unlikely I would have mets (I'm stage 1, grade 1), still I worry over every little ache and pain. I think it's just going to be an emotional rollercoaster for awhile. Thank you all for being there! Karen",

A friend offered to do it with me, but I just don't know that I'm emotionally up to it this year. Think I'll wait til next year. I agree about the stupidity of only checking our healthy breast once a year. I'm more worried about the healthy breast that the other one (figured the radiation zapped those nasty cancer cells quite thoroughly). It doesn't make a lot of sense. I'm also concerned because the radiologist had commented on \"calcifications\" in the right breast (the good one), which meant nothing to me at the time, but now I'm worried whether it might be a sign of DCIS. I have turned into SUCH a hypochondriac! I used to be the kind of person who NEVER went to the doctor and now I'm obsessing over ever symptom I have (doesn't help that Tamoxifen causes such a wide range of side effects).

Although they have the results, they won't give them to me - say I have to get them from MY doctor, but also said they would probably not have them into the computer until the end of the day, so I'll likely have to wait until I see the oncologist Monday morning. What worries me is that they came back and took extra pictures of my head and my rib (it was my leg that was hurting). I'm not so worried about the head, because I've had some arthritis in my neck for years, and I know arthritis will show up on a bone scan. I am very worried about why they were taking pictures of my ribs, since that is a common spot for cancer to metastasize. Looks like I'm in for another horrible weekend of waiting. I halfway get the logic of why they want your own doctor to give you test results, but it really results in unnecessary suffering. I'd rather know NOW, even if it's a radiologist I've never met who has to tell me. I know I may be reading too much into this, but when I had the mammogram, the waiting room was completely full when I went in, and by the time I left (with a cancer diagnosis), I was the only one left. The same thing happened today. Also, the tech who did the injection and started the scan did NOT come back out to take the extra pictures. She had been very friendly, but it was a different tech who came back out, and who avoided all eye contact. Again, I know I might be reading too much into this, but I don't have a good feeling about this. I'm really hoping I'll be posting Monday telling you all I've turned into a hypochondriacal drama queen. Karen",

I've had a few people tell me cataract surgery is pretty short and simple - it's just the idea of it. I talked to a friend tonight who is a doctor, and he also thought my symptoms were consistent with cataracts. Guess I'll find out Saturday. Sonia - I understand your concern about pain possibly meaning recurrence. I obsess about recurrence. I asked my oncologist today how many people he has seen with my stage cancer that eventually metastasized, and he said only 2. That made me feel better (he's in his 50s, so he's been doing this awhile). However, he also said those 2 really took him by surprise. I know that statistics are in my favor, but none of us have come out on the good end of statistics this year :(  I find I can be rational in the daytime, but it's much harder to be rational in the middle of the night. Speaking of unfairness - I have a 29-year-old coworker who's in ICU with either a tumor or aneurysm (they were supposed to find out today which it is - had to get the swelling on the brain down first). No real warning that anything was wrong until she unexpectedly had a seizure. You just never know.",

Julie - sorry you're having other health problems. I think all the doctor's visits we have all been having is just keeping cancer foremost in our minds.

Patty, I know what you mean about checking off forms. I find that now that I don't have cancer in my face quite so much, that I'm almost surprised all over again when something reminds me I have it. Only now it isn't a feeling of horror, so much as bewilderment, like \"I have cancer? Can that be right??\" Brenda, I get what you're saying about the lack of support in the \"real\" world. Monday was my birthday, and neither my brother or sister called me to wish me happy birthday. They've been avoiding me like the plague since I was diagnosed. Sometimes I just want to scream at them, but it would do no good. My brother send me a card, but usually he would call. I am tired of being sympathetic about how difficult my cancer has been for other people. It's not been a picnic for me, either! I'm sorry work and your mom are adding to your stress.

I picked up the mammogram films right before to take to the surgeon and a copy of the full report is in there. The report totally freaked me out, because it did verify that it was BIRADS 3 and that my breast density could \"markedly elevate\" the risk of false negatives. What is disturbing is that it already lists the false negative rate as possibly being as high as 25% - if my breast density \"markedly elevates\" that, isn't that almost to the point of flipping a coin \"head you have cancer, tails you don't\"? When I was first diagnosed, the mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI ALL MISSED that there was also DCIS - only found when they did the lumpectomy. The surgeon acknowledged that it is possible that there is more DCIS that is not showing up on tests, but he recommended that we do another mammogram in 6 months and see if there are any changes. He tried to be reassuring and he looked at the mammogram films himself and thought what they were seeing was radiation-related changes (the word \"calcification\" was used in the report and that scares me, too). I even talked to him about a possible propllyactic mastectomy. I don't want to make any drastic decisions, but if my breasts are so dense that mammograms aren't catching problems, that makes me REALLY anxious. I'm trying to just accept the surgeon's reassurances, but I certainly would have preferred a BIRADS 1 mammogram. I see the oncologist in January, and I'm going to get his opinion on it, too. So I guess I'm in the \"watchful waiting\" phase for the next few months. I can't swear I won't be asking total strangers to feel my breasts and see if they find any lumps!!

The radiation oncologist offered to talk to the radiologist, to see if my next test could be an MRI (due to breast density). The radiologist is NOW saying that my breasts \"aren't that dense\", even though her REPORT says \"false negative rate markedly elevated due to breast density\". Ummm, so which is it? The radiologist also said that there's no point in having an MRI for two years, because the false POSITIVE rate will be high during that time due to changes due to surgery and radiation. They tried to play it as \"we don't want you to have a false positive and get upset\". I told the oncologist I would rather spend a few days unduly upset by a false positive, that would easily be resolved by a biopsy, than be falsely secure by a false negative, and end up dying. THEN the oncologist says something to the effect of not wanting me to have a biopsy if it's not necessary, because the biopsy itself could \"unleash\" cancer cells. Ummm... if there ARE cancer cells that the biopsy is unleashing, that means I HAVE cancer again, and therefore we should have done the biopsy to find the cancer, and so that's a good thing, not a bad thing, right?? I ended the conversation by firming telling the radiation oncologist that a false positive was preferable to a false negative, and I wanted the MRI. Yeesh!! I think I'm going to post a thread and see what other people are being told about MRIs post-radiation. On a lighter note, she said that the reason for false positives on an MRI is \"fat necrosis\" - basically, the radiation killed fat cells. I told her she should have aimed that radiation beam at my butt instead of my breast! Sorry for the long vent, Karen",

The rads oncologist called the radiologist who did the mammo, because I wanted to be sure they do an MRI at the NEXT follow-up. The radiologist then says that my breasts \"are not really all that dense\" and she doesn't think an MRI is needed. So then why did she write in the report that my breasts were dense (and I was told that by a different radiologist when I was diagnosed in the first place). She tells the oncologist that an MRI will have \"too high a false positive rate\". WTH?? Maybe that will balance out that high false negative rate from the mammo!

These early days are the worst, because you're imagining the worst, you don't know much about it, and there are major decisions to be made. First of all, a 0.5 cm tumor is very small. You won't know the staging information until after surgery, but at this point you are talking about a small tumor and grade 1 is prognostically very good news. You will have to make the lumpectomy vs mastectomy decision, and there are pros and cons to both. As far as having kids, that may still be possible. You need to talk to your oncologist about the issue of fertility. It's chemo that causes the problem there, and not everyone has to have chemo. If you do end up having to have chemo, then you may want to talk to your doctors about harvesting your eggs. I made a friend at this time last year who was going through treatment, and she is now 5 months pregnant with her first son. One year ago, she was in the same position you are in, so things can work out. As far as work, most people with early stage breast cancer are able to continue working, although you'll need time off for surgery and medical appointments, obviously. I know it feels like your life has been turned upside down, but you WILL get through it.

It would be easier getting through treatment while working parttime, but if this is really your dream job you need to weigh the costs and the benefits. Would the employer let you delay starting until treatment is finished? I worked full-time through treatment, taking off a week for surgery, and then leaving work early for radiation treatment (no chemo needed). I was pretty wiped out by the end of radiation, though. I'd get a treatment plan in place with the oncologist, then talk to the potential employer about your options.",

I'm okay with that, but they don't do any other follow-up tests. I have researched this, and understand that this is typical (and I truly get what he means about false positive and false negatives). I just hate waiting 6 more months to get the \"all clear\".

Like you, I want someone to be able to tell me WITH CONFIDENCE that it is GONE. My radiation oncologist tried to assure me that I no longer have cancer. Which had me thinking, so why am I having 33 radiation treatments??? She said it is just \"insurance\". I do understand the logic of why they do not want to expose us to multiple tests that involve additional exposure to radiation. I guess I just want proof that the cancer is gone. My medical oncologist did tell me that the \"index of suspicion\" is very low for cancer patients, however, and that if I have any pain that persists or any symptom they cannot readily account for, that it will result in scans to check it out. He said to be sure to let him know if anything is out of the ordinary. Still, I'll be relieved when I get my mammo and ultrasound six months after radiation. I won't really believe I'm in remission until that happens. Blessings, Karen",

I'd seriously consider it if I was you. You might want to read some of the radiation threads done by month (i.e. July radiation) to get a feel for the side effects people can have with regular radiation. Obviously, it's your call about whether you choose to \"skip\" radiation entirely. Personally, I preferred to do everything possible so that if I do have a recurrence, I could honestly say to myself I did everything recommended. I don't have a high tolerance for risk, though, and some people do. I knew when I made the choice for lumpectomy rather than mastectomy that radiation was just part of the treatment package, so I never seriously considered NOT doing it.

When I was first diagnosed he had told me that \"we don't use the word cured anymore\" and I had too much information to process to follow up with that at the time. He explained to me that with breast cancer (and melanoma) they do NOT consider them to ever be \"cured\" because both are prone to \"late relapses.\" With most other cancers, if you make it to the five-year mark, your risk of relapse goes down to the same as the general population. This is not true for most breast cancers. That does not, however, mean that it cannot be successfully treated, particularly in the earliest stages. He also noted that it is impossible to determine WHO will be successfully treated and whether the cancer is actually gone. I am one of those fortunate \"Stage I, grade 1\" people. But I get what Lowrider is saying - there is no guarantee in being stage I - I could be diagnosed next month with Stage IV - or I may never have another incident of cancer again. Odds are in my favor - low oncotype score,  no nodes, etc, but I do not  consider myself \"cured\". NED, yes; cured, no. Not unless they actually can come up with something that can TELL whether there are stray cells lurking dormant somewhere or actually succeed in coming up with that \"off\" switch that can make sure it will never metastasize. And I agree with Lowrider: 30 - 40 % having a recurrence are HORRIBLE statistics. Karen",

Mammograms aren't all that good at finding things in dense breasts. Alternately, you may want to ask them to go ahead and biopsy it, if that will give you peace of mind. If they're telling you it's okay to wait for six months and see what happens, then they think it's probably benign. Breast cancer tends to grow  slowly and 7 to 8 mm is quite small. Talk it over with your doctor and see what he/she thinks. Everything probably is okay, but I can understand wanting to know for sure. Please let us know what you end up doing, Karen",

Not only is there a problem with false positives, which results in more tests and stress, it involves unnecessary radiation exposure. Like Coolbreeze said, I think it's NCI that sets those guidelines and discusses them somewhere on their website. However, my oncologist assured me that his \"index of suspicion\" would be low for any symptoms I had, and that they would follow things up closely. Therefore, when I had persistent pain in my leg, I got a bonescan (which came back fine). Pay attention to people's \"stats\" when you look at their responses. The stage II and III women usually get the scans because they are node positive, so there is more reason to be concerned about possible metastasis. A breast MRI  is typical prior to surgery - that's to be sure there is not cancer somewhere else in the breasts. It's also not unusual to not meet with the oncologist until post-surgery (as Beesie said). Again, this might be a different protocol if I had been Stage III instead of Stage I. I had my surgery, the surgeon reviewed the pathology report post-surgery with me and THEN I was sent to the medical oncologist who made the decisions regarding chemo, and then sent on to the radiation oncologist. The surgeon continues to be the head of my treatment team, which initially struck me as strange but is apparently fairly common. Karen",

In case you did not know this, lumpectomies are usually outpatient surgeries. They are not cheap, but they are actually the cheapest part of treatment - my lumpectomy actually cost LESS than the day I spent at the breast care center getting the mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy. Chemotherapy and radiation are actually much more expensive. My co-pays for the whole thing came in around $300 (I do have really good insurance, though). If you have to, most hospitals and doctors will work out payment plans for the co-pays. I am sympathetic about the lack of a support system. I am single and live alone. My family live in another city (and have honestly never been all that supportive). It certainly makes treatment more difficult. My thoughts and prayers are with you, Karen",

Personally, I was very grateful to the radiologist for being upfront with me. She told me point blank prior to the biopsy that she was pretty sure it was cancer, and I started mentally preparing myself for how I would handle it and what I would do. This all happened on a Friday. I went into work Monday, and waited for the call. If I had it to do over again, I would have taken the day off, and given myself a little more time to adjust. I was pretty useless at work that day. I hope your results come back benign, but even if they don't you CAN get through this. You just have to take it one step at a time.

In my case, they had done the biopsy, knew it was cancer, and wanted the MRI to see if there was anything else going on before the surgeon did the lumpectomy. They scheduled it as quick as possible and it was outside the recommended timeframe. It makes it harder for the radiologist to read, because hormonal changes get picked up and the MRI looks \"busy\". If they thought it was urgent, they would go ahead and do the MRI, but it is probably better to wait until the right time of your cycle, so they get better information from it. I know you're anxious, but breastcancer is  slow-growing, so even if it IS cancer, the few weeks won't make much difference. You might want to talk to the surgeon and get his/her input on whether it's best to wait for the MRI or go ahead and do it. It's the biopsy that makes the definitive diagnosis - do you know when that is going to be? I know it's hard to stay calm, but most biopsies turn out to be benign. Wishing you the best, Karen",

The radiologist did the mammo, ultrasound, and biopsy all during that same visit - and she's the one who told me that it appeared I had cancer (birads 5 and the tumor was clearly visible on the ultrasound). Once the biopsy confirmed what we already knew, they scheduled me with the surgeon and I had the MRI done that same week. It might be that if your lump is small enough that the biopsy and lumpectomy will be one and the same, which may be why your surgeon wants the results prior to scheduling the biopsy. In my case, they did the biopsy the same day as the mammogram, then the MRI was done prior to the lumpectomy. The breast care center had a nurse navigator who got everything set up for me - the surgeon, the MRI, etc. If you have the option of switching to a breast care center, you might want to consider it. This whole process is stressful enough without needing to schedule your own tests.",
