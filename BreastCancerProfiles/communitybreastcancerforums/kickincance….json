I found out by accident that I had recurrence of bc with bi-lateral lung nodules in 2012. I was on Femara until July 2014. Femara took care of all of them except for 1 nodule. Switched to Faslodex in July. Nodule is still growing. I am supposed to a wedge resection of the lung to remove the nodule in a few weeks. Pretty big surgery. My MO's and the radiologist all said to get it taken out. Anyone have this surgery done? Really hoping that the meds would have taken care of this on their own. MO said the surgery can add years to my life. ",
