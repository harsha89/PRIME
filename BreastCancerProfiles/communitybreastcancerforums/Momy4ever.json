I already spoke with my MO for additional treatment and he will start me on Xeloda as soon as my wounds heel. I had another surgery last week because of an open wound and a necrosis area in my left mastectomy, the PS removed the necrotic part and restitched the skin. They want my wounds to heel before starting me on xeloda and radiation. Also the PS wants to finish the filling of the expander before the start of radiation. Is that the usual procedure, finish the filling before the radiation? I was supposed to start radiation mid February but now i have to heel first and finish the filling I don't think it will be possible. We'll see.",

I have multifocal cancer, the bigger tumor was 6cm, er/pr +, I had 6 rounds of neoadjuvent chemo ACT My follow up with my onc was very promising as we noticed that the tumor shrunk and the underarm node reduced in size. I had my Bmx surgery a week ago. My path report revealed that I still have 11 positive nodes, the tumors did shrunk and had a lot of necrosis, the biggest tumor went from 6 cm to 2 cm. My big shock was that it turned out to be triple negative. i was devastated by the TN news as I was hoping that the hormone therapy will help with the residual cancer but now what chance do I have? I will meet with my onc next week to discuss if I can have more chemo before the radiation. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",

So they ordered a pet scan to check for distance mets. It was done after the biopsy result and before I started the neoadjuvent chemo. I think for early stages they don't do pet scan before the surgery. Me too I will miss my breasts. As much as I want them gone and get rid of cancer \"hopefully\" I keep looking at them and checking them. Poor DH he was so much in love with them :( For the nipple sparing, I won't keep them ... the cancer site one will go so her sister will go with her. I don't want to keep it and be sorry later . I have big saggy boobs so no need to risk necrosis. Has anyone of you decided on the size of her tissue expander to achieve the C size later, mine will be 550 cc, I know that it d√©pends on each one height, weight, chest measurements. Just curious to know",
