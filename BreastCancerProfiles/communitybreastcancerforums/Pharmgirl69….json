I had my biopsy November 29. 12 days after symptoms of IBC started and a round of antibiotics yielded no results. 3-5 business days for results. BIRAD 5, highly suspect inflammatory breast cancer. This is the longest weekend of my life. I was a mess Thursday and Friday and got a script for some ativan. The weekend with my family has been better and just trying to stay busy. I need to take the advice I give my patients....WebMD is NOT your friend. Dagney and Bonnie I'm sorry to hear your results. Big hugs and prayers for strength.",

Nothing I have read indicates that DCIS can cause the swelling and redness that I have however, my PCP said it may just be my bodies response to something it doesn't like. So here I am, one toe in the \"waiting for results\" and one toe in the \"just diagnosed\". Sigh",

Luckily, they didn't wait for the second antibiotic to begin suspecting something else. I asked the doctor today is DCIS would cause the redness and swelling and she said it might just be my body reacting to something it doesn' like. Which clinically speaking I guess makes sense. I have an appt with the breast surgeon on thursday and hopefully we will have the final results then and can figure out a plan.

Is IDC a progression of DCIS? Are they 2 different things? What about the IBC? And I have horrible swelling and skin changes and peu d'orange?

I do feel better now that I have an official diagnosis and somewhat of a plan while we wait for the hormone stuff. I feel like so far the waiting for results really, honestly is the hardest part. My surgeon didn't biopsy for IBC yesterday. She is very cut and dry and when asked if it was IBC she said Yes, it is. So apparently she didn't have to biopsy.

Bowser....you're insight is so important to us as we are all watching our partners and spouses go through the same thing you are. Trying to be strong and supportive while falling apart inside. My husband is the same. When we told our youngest daughter he had to walk out of the room. He has \"moments\" just like I do but he is trying not to have them in front of me. He has reached out to his BFF who lives 600 miles from us. They have been best friends for 20 years but talk infrequently. She has helped him since she is kind of \"distant\" but loves us both. I think its important for him to be able to have his support system as well, that might be a little different than mine. The odd thing is, I dont really want him to be strong for me. I want him to break down with me, I dont want him to always have to be the strong one. If that makes sense? Anyway, I'm spending the weekend baking christmas cookies and homemade bread and apple butter. Business as usual so i dont obsess.

My first chemo was last Friday so I'm on Day 6. The day after was fine but by Sunday I felt like I had the flu. Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were tough. I tried to go to work on Tuesday and it was all I could do to dry off after a shower......let alone drive into work. So I took off Tuesday and worked 1/2 a day yesterday and so far I've got 7.5 hours on the clock today...woo hooo. The fatigue is horrendous! It's the worst part, like a fatigue I've never felt before. Soul-sucking. I did lose all sense of taste except for tangy foods. Orange sherbet, greek yogurt and Pineapple/mango juice is the BEST THING EVER!!!!! I did start with some mouth soreness/dryness and have some sores. I would've thought that the tangy flavors would irritate that but they really don't. Cold and tangy is my best friend. I have lost my appetite for some things and found I can't tolerate meat at all. (haven't broken that news to my husband yet lol). I, too, have kept Zofran on board around the clock and I believe that is the reason why I have not been nauseated that much. Overall, I've been very fortunate to not have the side effects that you hear about. My husband says if this is all this cancer has got then bring it on!!!!!!! Not sure I like that challenge but he does have a point. I did end up shaving my head on 12/30. My biggest fear was losing it on cancer's terms. It gave me some control and is liberating. I got my wig a few hours later and have been wearing it to work. It's not bad and I can tolerate it but much like my bra, its the first thing that comes off when I get home. I'm so glad to hear your wife is having an \"ok\" time of it too. So far so good. My husband has been my angel. It's been a rough week. Yesterday on my way to work for first time back my car broke down, so after only sleeping 2 hours off he comes to rescue me at 6am. Then our little one had her wisdom teeth out and he nursed her like a champ. I figure we are getting all the sucky stuff out of the way now. jdr.........so happy to hear the good news!!! We are here if you ever need us but hopefully you won't! Sahicks......will keep you in my thoughts. Off to another meeting, will check back in later. Hugs everyone and anyone I missed ",

Bowser, I have no idea how your wife was up to go to a movie after her port....I was sore as all get out and had to break down and take a pain pill. Feeling a little better today, I can at least move my right arm today. I asked the Breast surgeon about my PET scan yesterday. They didn't have the full report but did say it looked good. A few areas \"lit\" and the BO would probably want to follow up but nothing concerning. Since this conversation was post-anesthesia, I left it at that for now and will get more infor Wednesday at my pre-Chemo appointment. That eased my worry enough to get me through the weekend. \"nothing concerning\" was music to my areas. Start chemo next friday, went wig shopping and plan on shaving my head New Years Eve....what a party! I didn't purchase a wig yet as I'm not sure how I feel about them but getting one isn't off the table. I think getting one would make other people more comfortable being around me but I just don't know if i will be more self conscious WITH one. I hope everyone is ready for the holiday. We've all had so much going on I know I am running very behind schedule with shopping/wrapping etc. Have a very Happy Holiday and big hugs to everyone in the waiting room! Stacey",

First chemo officially started at exactly 1230. So far no reactions. Had the pre treatment of steroids and zofran and am already starving. I was hoping a positive side effect of the chemo would be weight loss but if this is any indication of how these steroids are gonna work....It's not happening! Lol At any rate, thinking about all of you and please know I'm reading all of your posts and you are all in my thoughts and prayers as we each battle our own demons joined by a common thread. Hugs!",

My PCP just called and told me to prepare for the surgeon to do more testing. It sounds like they are unsure if there is lymph node involvement and I suspect they will skin biopsy today as well to test now for ibc. Hurry up and wait seems like motto lately.",

I'm so sorry. Prayers for B9 results. NS...try to enjoy the weekend. You are going to drive yourself crazy trying to make decisions with no information. i know that is easier said than done and you probably have to do SOMETHING while you wait. If your doc wont look into your symptoms, get a second opinion. Beachside.....sending all warm thoughts for Tuesday.. please make sure you check in and let us know how you made out. Happy weekend folks....the weekends seem to be the toughest. Maybe cause we know there are no doctors open on the weekends so we aren't anticipating any news. Maybe cause we have more time to think. At any rate, have a happy sunday",

Remind me again, was your wife ER/PR - and HER2+? IBC? I'm getting confused I think. Is she having a port put in? Did they discuss exactly what the chemo treatment would be or are they waiting for the brain scan to come back? So many questions as I'm sure you do too. Chemo forever? Prayers for b9 on both of the tests you are now waiting for and prayers for smooth chemo. We will be here in the waiting room when you are ready. I go to Onc tomorrow and genetic counselor and will see what my next steps are.",
