NOW, my baby sister (she's the youngest at 51) was diagnosed with invasive cancer in breast (found on mammogram). She just had a lumpectomy and SNB last week. The surgeon is recommending rads done with a catheter, localized for2x a day for 2 weeks. This would be done if the margins are good size. She will get her path report and meet with surgeon next friday to discuss how rads would be done. Has anyone else heard about this catheter type radiation? It's new to me--and I'd like to make sure my little sis gets just what she needs. Evidently, when they did the MRI biopsy, they stated that the cancer was 1.4 centimeters, stage 1. Any help with this would be great. Thanks, Pomegranate",

She did great, and is a little tired. The radiation pellet is put in the catheter in her breast (at the removal site of the cancer) for 10 minutes and then removed. Evidently El Camino Hospital has been using this procedure for 10 years (and also the standard type), depending on the path report. The catheter/pellet type is used a week after surgery--no waiting for the breast to heal. The radiation therapists recommended Miaderm (over the counter purchase) for any skin problems. A bit pricey--$36. for one tube. However, the Cancer Center was having a sale--so she received 2 for the price of 1. My thoughts and prayers are with all of you. Take care, pomegranate",
