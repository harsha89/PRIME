What have you been experiencing? Lori",

I just hope this isn't going to be the end of my being able to exercise as it's been one of the things that has kept me \"sane\" in this crazy battle we're fighting on a daily basis.  I also get very weepy from time to time. The only good things I can say about the drug are my tumor markers have gone to 24 from 51 intially, and my most recent bone scan was \"stable\" as I had mets in my right hip. Also, I initally had mets in the orbit of my eye, which were the first mets to clear up.  I also get a monthly infusion of Zometa... haven't had any other teatments so far and it seems the Zometa is keeping the bone mets from progressing. Even though the SE's of Femara are tough, I guess I should be happy it's keeping the cancer at bay for now.  What would we do without this website and all of the wonderful people who post.  I know it has helped me tremendously.  Thanks to all.",
