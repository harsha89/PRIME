I made an appointment with my PCP and she felt it as well, was concerned, and sent me for an ultrasound the same day. Ultrasoud tech found a 7mm hypoechoic mass a 10 O'Clock. This is right where I felt my lump. After the radiologist views the images he come in and says that it's \"probably a cyst or benign mass since I'm so young and have no family history. Let's wait a see if anything changes\". He then leaves and I'm sitting there with questions and worried. I'm so sick of hearing \"because of your age you don't need to worry.\" Ugh. If you have been through this before and want to see my images I can email them to you. Please help. Thanks. Miss.Jess  Log in to post a reply",

They requested I bring my images and report. I am going to ask for a biopsy. My husband is going with me.  I have done self breast exams every month since I had my son at age 19. I have never felt this before. I am very familair with both my breasts.  I did not find the aroud the time of a period, as I have not had one in almost 4 years. I am on the Depo shot. I have done my own \"research\" and reviewed my images a million times. The image they measured looks suspicious compared to malignant images I have compared it to. I wonder if the radiologist even took the time to zoom in and really study the lump. This just happened to me a few months ago. I broke my right arm, went to the ER, and after my X-Ray the PA assured me is wasn't broken. He said it was just a pretty bad bone bruise. The next day I had an appointment with my dermatologist to have a mole removed and when he saw my arm he said to go back. Well, I went to another facility and sure enough it was broken. Had the radiologist zoomed in just a little more he would have seen the hairline fracture. I was casted and furious. Anyways, I'm just glad I'm going to a breast specialist. Hopefully, I can get definite answers and move on. For all of you who are waiting for results...I hope you all get great news. This is no fun. Miss.Jess ",

He did know it wasn't a cyst because when he pressed down it didn't move. He said it was fluid filled it would have flattened. He has been doing this almost 15 years and he said he honestly couldn't say what it was. So, he scheduled me for a lumpectomy on Thursday. That way the whole mass is out and the entire thing can be sent to pathology. The results should take about a week. Keep me in your thoughts and prayers please. Miss.Jess",
