I read a few times here that the outside world just does not know what we are going through - and I have already found out that is so true. I find that not only am I physically tired, but I think I had been emotionally tired for a few years now. Is it bad that I am using this time after surgery to take a step back and look at life? I don't want to be throwing my heart and soul into my job and have done so for almost 20 years. I have always had the fear that if I do step back, I will lose my job. In my head, I don't see how that is possible - my heart is not in sync with my head though. Mimi - that is excellent news for you and I congratulate you!",
