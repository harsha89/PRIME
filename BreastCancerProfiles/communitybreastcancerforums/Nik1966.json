Those results changed my whole attitude to chemo. I had my first cycle yesterday - then every 21 days for 6 cycles, then they give me a month off to recover.  I will have 5 weeks of radiation, then hormone treatment.  After which I will have my right breast removed as well.  They don't offer that routinely in New Zealand, but will do it after treatment has finished. Good luck with your treatment.  We're going into summer here, so I am worried about having to wear either a wig or a hat out in the heat.  You can get away with it in winter ;-)",

I have been lucky and had very few side effects in terms of fatigue and nausea (thank goodness for seabands). I have only had my infusion day off work, and managed to pretty much keep to my normal schedule for everything including the kids activities. Here's the but ...... I ended up back at the hospital on Thursday with an infection in my port incision and the most horrendous case of Mucositis (basically ulceration of the roof of my mouth). Apparently it is very common (40% of FEC chemo patients get it), and other than gargles and gel there isn't much the Doctors can do for me (antibiotics for the port infection). Even swallowing water hurts, and it is further complicated by my wearing braces. The Doctor said that it should resolve once my white blood cells come back, and if it doesn't then they will reduce my chemo dose or delay my next treatment. I had my wig fitted yesterday, it looks ok. I also asked them to shave my head which was my way of taking some control back I think. I had started getting some inflamation on my scalp so it was a matter of days before it started to go. I had visions of being in a gust of wind and it all flying off! I have several hats and buffs to wear. It does feel weird though. I get a fright when I look in the mirror, but everyone else in my house hasn't batted an eyelid. I must have prepared them well :-) Hope everyone is doing ok.",
