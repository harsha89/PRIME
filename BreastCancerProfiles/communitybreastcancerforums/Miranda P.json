She stated & feels because my pathology came back clear after my double mastectomy no radiation was needed. She did say that for the next 5 years I need chest CT\u2019s. No mention of MRI\u2019s. I am doing excellent. Don\u2019t lose hope or be dismayed. Life does go on and gets better. This is just temporary. I am getting ready for the last stage of my reconstructive surgery and get my FOOBS next month. I\u2019m not looking forward to another surgery but, I\u2019m hopeful and know how incredibly blessed I am. Just trying to take one day at a time and allowing myself to \u201cjust be.\u201d Stay positive and know that you\u2019re not alone in this journey. Don\u2019t lose your joy! Smile and know you\u2019re supported and loved. All my best, Pam ðŸ˜Š",
