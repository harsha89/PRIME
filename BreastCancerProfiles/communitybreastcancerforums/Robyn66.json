      "Content": "Robyn66 wrote: Forgive me if this is a duplicate, it doesn't seem that the first one went up Ok, I am having the ultrasound lymph node fine needle aspiration today, I was in stone cold panic about it yesterday.  I called my oncologist and she basically said what you guys said that even slightly enlarged lymph nodes need to be checked so that when I go in for surgery, if God forbid there is cancer there, the surgeon will know to take out the lymph nodes too.  She also said what you guys said about there being many things that make lymph nodes swell.  She seemed kind of puzzled that I was this upset.  So I am thinking that this may be a routine thing.  So now that I am a little more clear headed, I was thinking about something and I want to ask you with all of your vast experience if I am making sense and although I know there are no guarantees, maybe my thinking is on the right track which will make me feel a whole lot better. I was diagnosed Aug 19, 2008, there was an MRI done.  The surgeon I saw locally said there was no indication that there were lymph nodes involved. The biopsy revealed I have Invasive Ductile Carcinoma.  The tumor is 1.4cm it is ER+/PR+, HER2+. I had a second MRI about a week later for a biopsy which never occurred ,  on a suspicious area on my left breast that turned out to be non-existent when they looked.  No one mentioned anything about lymph nodes at all.   When the Radiologist came in after the MRI to tell me they found nothing to biopsy he told me he knew I was going to be alright.  Kind of strange for him to go out of his way to do that.  When I went to Brigham and Woman's in Boston they examined me pretty thoroughly and didn't feel any lymph nodes but they ordered a third MRI because the format of the one the other hospital did was too small and didn't work well with their software and also probably because most hospitals want their own MRI.  The new surgeon said he saw a lymph node on the new MRI and was ordering this biopsy to see if there was tumor in it.  This sent me into a cold panic. ANYWAY The surgeon at the first hospital I was  not an idiot, and he didn't see lymph nodes.  In fact, other than seeing the lymph node the opinion of the first and second surgeon are the same.  I am mostly in Boston for Dana Farber so I can have access to the best and newest cancer treatment. From all accounts I have not heard anything bad about the radiologist at the hospital where I had the two MRI's So between 1st MRI  August 13tth , the second MRI August 26,  and the third  MRI September 11, .either something other than cancer made the lymph node enlarge or the cancer spread in record time.  And if the cancer spread wouldn't that mean the tumor should have gotten bigger?  No one has said that happened. Plus I feel like I am fighting off a cold and I have had allergies for a month at least. So am I just trying to justify myself crazy or does this make sense?

As you know I had the mastectomy Oct 27, and the surgeon was surprised to find the sentinel node affected.  So he took them all out for testing.  This was beleived to be early and realitively no big deal cancer initially.  So that freaked me out.  The good news is that it turns out that only one node was affected and the rest were clear.  I met with Dr. Jennifer Ligibel at Dana Farber on Wednesday.  She is not sure about the HER2 status of the original Biopsy done up in Peterborough where the original diagnosis was done, so I should hear about that today.  That may be good news but even if it isn't, with herceptin I will still have an 85% chance of being ok forever after this mess is over.  Because of the lymphnode, I am stage 2 which isn't bad.  There were also three small tumors found instead of just the one they thought was there. I of course have to have a ct scan and a bone scan because its routine. But here is what has me freaked me out. I had been blowing off having mamograms for years.  In fact I almost blew off having this one.  I don't know what made me go get this one but thank God I did, because it was probably my last chance to get this before it would have been all through my lymphnodes at least.  I am scared of these last tests even though Dr. Ligibel said they were routine and no big deal and was clear that she didn't think there would be anything there but my surgeon who I know is one of the best in the world was pretty sure my lymphnodes wouldn't be involved and he wasn't right so who knows if there is another nasty surprise in store for me? When we were in the waiting room at Dana Farber, there was a woman there very upset who has 6 stage 4 cancers and was complaing about everything.  I felt really bad for her but she was going on and on for 20 minutes and I thought I was going to start screaming!  After my appointment she ended up coming out at the same time and was still complaining.  Not that she didn't have every right and reason to complain but this was just too much for me to deal with.  We almost ended up on the same elevator with her but my husband and I managed to walk around the floor to avoid it. The atmosphere is so different from Brigham and WOmans.  Not that they aren't all lovely people.  They are very nice.  My mother went there when she had lung cancer.  SHe died 13 years ago so that was another problem because even though they renovated it since then it was still looked enough like the same hospital to bring all that back too.  On the drive home my husband nailed it.  He said Brigham and Women's felt like a hospital and Dana Farber felt like a morgue and it just did.  I don't know how I am going to force myself to keep going back there.  I am going to because its the best place to go but ever since I have been there I have been having nightmares about dying.  And I am also at the end of my rope about waiting for test results.  I am just so tired of waiting to hear catestrophic news.  Top that all with the pain of my dressings and drains  and money stresses too.  I just feel like this is a horrific nightmare I wish I could wake up from!

I am with you, we take a two hour drive or train ride to get in to Boston and there is no way I will change.  You cannot imagine how the hospital that originaly diagnosed me messed up tests that had to be re-done up here in NH.  There should be a warning at the hospital saying DON\"T BE TREATED HERE FOR CANCER!  and I have heard that nurses at that hospital actually tell people to go to Boston and NOT be treated there!  There was no question of Boston for me.  They were wonderful to my mom and gave her 18 months she wouldn't have had ordinarily.  But I am going to ask if Dr. Ligibel can see me in the Breast Center at BWH.  The worst that can happen is she will say no.  But I know she is one of the best so I will see her where I need to see her.",

In the right breast I have what the surgon called typical ductal -something (I don't have the notes.  My friend is typing them up for me) Basically its the most common form of breast cancer.  It is one centreal mass about 1.5 cm with 5 tiny satelite nodes developing around it.  In the left breast is another mass that they can't get to with the ultra sound so it will have to be an MRI guided biopsy.  It is assumed that it is cancer as well but we don't know what kind.  We do not know if the first tumor is estragen dependant because we haven't received the pathology yet.  What he was encouraged by was the dye used in the MRI did not indicate anything was headed toward the lymphnodes so although there are not promises yet it indications point in the drection of the lymphnodes  being clean and this being early. I was totaly fine with my sending everything to DANA Farber in Boston which is where I want the surgery done.  Double mastectomy and reconstruction.  Followed by chemo.  From there I don't know what will happen.   I don't know how I can be sure this will not come back in my bones or how I can protect myself.  I am going to undergo genetic testing for the breast cancer gene.  I think my daughters are too.  Especially because they have a grandmother and a mother with breast cancer.  I guess the prognosis looks good but I am still terrified and am grieving for my body being cut up.  Not that I am anything much to look at but I always liked my breasts now they are going to be gone.  I am crying A LOT.  I HATE PINK RIBBONS too.  I am going to have to get a wig.  Does someone know where I can get a kit to cast my breast so I can keep them- like you can get a kit to cast a baby's hand.  It sounds wierd but I really want that.     I have decided to take my daugters back to school shopping with money I can;t afford to spend.  but I don;t really care.  I am greiving deeply today!  I will be back on later, Love to all Robyn Dx 8/19/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage II, 1/10 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
