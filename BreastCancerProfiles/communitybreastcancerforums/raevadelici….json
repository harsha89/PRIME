It sounds exactly the same as what I've had for 1.5 years. Jan 2016 I got very worried and went to dr but was told it was ok. In November 2016 the pain and swelling/lump was back and went back to drs and referred to hospital and was told same as you (costochondritis) but like you didnt feel it was that as I certainly wouldn't describe it as rib pain. So now after 1.5 years, in June 2016 the pain is still very bad with that breast (right) being noticeably bigger and swollen/firmer and very painful. I'm just desperate to find a diagnosis to stop this pain as I keep thinking pain and swelling can't be good for it. And as the pain is constantly worrying is constant. Thank you in advance :",
