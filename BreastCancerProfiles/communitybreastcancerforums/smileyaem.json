I've been on Abraxane for 9 months and it has been keeping my multiple bone mets ( spine,ribs,sternum & femurs) stable. My tumor markers have been going up so my Doc moved my scans up by a month to see if any thing is progressing. If there is any new growth he mentioned trying Doxil or Navebine. Any input about experiences with these drugs would be helpful. Thank you for any advice.  Dx 6/2002, 1cm, 0/16 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
