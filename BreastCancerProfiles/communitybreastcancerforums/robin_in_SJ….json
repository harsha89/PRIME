It is all anxiety producing and I feel the older and more things we have to deal with the harder it gets, you have every reason to be be depressed and anxious. I've needed antidepressants before and it helped. I hate talking all the meds, too but I'll continue and do more if that's what I need to keep diseases away and have a QOL.",

Some days are better, I would say in general okay and the anxiety is much better. My cardiologist said I could have 1 drink a week, so last night a had 1/2 of glass of wine and felt so sick--like I drank all night. I had to leave the dinner table, luckly it only lasted 30 minutes. Don't think I'll be drinking for a while. Not sure if it is the beta blocker which I just started or that and the wine.",

Saw my oncologist in October and took a 1 month holiday but still felt fatigue. Called my cardiologist and saw him last week he started me on diuretics to remove the extra water I've been retaining. I also saw my therapist and he cleared with my cardiologist taking Wellbutrin to help with energy and depression. I'm glad to have the Wellbutrin it is helping to reduce the fatigue but I still get tired easily. Since I just started it I hope the benefit improves over the next few weeks. I wish my oncologist had followed up with my complaints of fatigue earlier which really started a year after treatment. I told every doctor it was my biggest complaint but I guess on hindsight I should have made it more of an issue but I just didn't know if it was normal after all the treatment. I love my cardiologist and feel good in his care.  Michele, I'll look up the facebook. I feel I could use it. Robin   ",

I was diagnosed with chemo-induced cardiomyopathy on Monday and I am having high anxiety, I had to dig out some Xanax from by treatment in 2013, never liked it but it helped this week. After chemo and radiation in Nov 2013, I had fatigue - but who didn't? I thought it was normal but over the last yr. my fatigue increased and last winter I started to have shortness of breath when walking a hill at work. I talked to my Oncologist and Endo, and anyone who would listen. I ended starting ritalin last winter so I wouldn't feel that I was going to fall asleep driving home from work. The last few months the breathless and fatigue increased. Last week I had an echocardiogram done. On my baseline echo before treatment - LVEF was 65% nice and normal. On my echo last Fri. the LVEF was 35-45%. A significant decline. Yesterday, I saw a cardiologist who treats chemo induced cardiomyopathy. He started me on an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) for 5 days then I'll call him and if all is going well I'll start a beta blocker. I have been having lots of anxiety with this diagnosis, which I feel is as serious as the cancer. He is also scheduling a stress echo to rule out any other issues. He said I wasn't retaining a lot of water and recommend typical life style changes. He will discuss with the oncologist what to do about the AI, I'm on a holiday but AI also can effect the heart. I'll know when I call next week what their recommendation is; stay on Aromasin, change or stay of an AI. I have to take my BP, pulse and weight every day and report back to him with changes. Faith, I know the fatigue and breathless sucks, your in my thoughts and I hope your Cardio and MO have treatments to help with this and the MBC. Please keep us up to date. Denise - OMG - my dream is to feel so much better. So happy for you - thanks for sharing.",

It is very scary to have cancer and then find out the treatment resulted in a new scare - cardiomyopathy. My ejection fraction was 30/35 when diagnosed. My baseline prior to chemo was 65. I now take a betablocker and ACE Inhibitor. I adjusted well to the ACE inhibitor but when we introduced the betablocker I had increased fatigue and was lightheaded/dizzy for several weeks while my body adjusted. The cardiologist slowly increased the meds with increased side effects each time. After six weeks had a stress echo done. My ejection fraction rate improved to 45-50, very good and significant :-) !!! We cut back the betablocker dose. During the stress test my heart did go into a PVC Premature ventricular contractions so they had to stop the test but did enough to know my heart is doing better and responding to the medications. The shortness of breath is better but still noticeable and I try and walk a few miles everyday to increase my strength. I don't think I'll see a complete reversal - no cure but the drugs help manage the symptoms. I was happy to stop the progression and it took about 6 weeks. During that time I had to take a medical leave since the cardiomyopathy and drugs made me so exhausted that I could get out of bed some days and/or I was dizzy and afraid to drive. I am now working part-time and I'll be retiring fully in January. I can't keep up with the work and often have bad days. But I do have good days, it's hard to predict. I have other health issues so my fatigue is from a combo of things but the 2 big contributors from MPV is the hormone blocker and Cardiomyopathy. I hope your body is adjusting to the medication and your starting to feel better, it's a long process. Feel free to reach out with any other questions.  ",
