The piece she wrote discusses a recent carefully done study in the NEJM.  When women with lymphedema participated in a controlled weight lifting program their lymphedema improved.  This is contrary to what would have been expected. The point Dr. Love was making in her piece is that not all of the recommendations made about how to prevent or treat lymphedema are evidenced-based. For years, women with lymphedema have been told that they should avoid certain activities as it would make their lymphdema worse. One such activity was lifting. Toward the end of the piece she suggested that, in the future, we may find that other recommendations may also come into question. She did not say or imply there was no need for lymphedema risk reductions. Regarding the same author's post about the NCI's funding of the Love/Avon Army of Women. The author quoted a columnist on the Huffington Post who has certain opinions that differ from Dr. Love's. However, the statement he made is not true. The NCI is not terminating its partnership with the Love/Avon Army of Women (www.armyofwomen.org). In fact, the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation is working very closely with the NCI on a new research project that will be unveiled later this year. Finally Dr Love is very accessible and welcomes comments and even criticisms through the contact us page on her website, slove@earthlink.net, or her facebook page.  We are all striving for the same goal:  a world without breast cancer!",
