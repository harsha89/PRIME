I was sore but not intolerable . My underarm was the most painful and still is do to cording . Also I got tired pretty easily the first week or two . Fortunatley I work at home so it hasn't been a big issue for me. Good luck to you !   Jackie",

I was most definately scared but my bc was very confident about my outcome which really helped me to calm down .My nodes were clear thankfully . I meet with a medical onco tomorrow and then a rad onco . The plan acording to my bc will be 6-7 weeks of radiation and then go on tamoxifen . I can tell you this ..my recovery has been pretty easy except for some cording going on in my arm .Make a list and ask all the questions you can think of. I wish you the best outcome ! Jackie",
