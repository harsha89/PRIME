My next is on the 9th, so far the SE haven't been that bad, Nausea for the first 3 days, and bone pain with the Neulasta shot. How many have tried Claritin for the bone pain? Does it really work, I took Vicodin as little as I could to take care of the pain, but not knock me out, I seem really sesitive to those kind of medications. Staci",

I started chemo last week, and from what I've read and the doctor has told me I start losing my hair around this weekend. I'm just not sure how soon I should shave my head. My daughter says I should go for a mohawk at first, which I think I just might. I've been so worried about going out in public with a bald head, especially since it looks like I'll lose my hair before I am able to buy a wig, (I do have a couple scarves, but haven't got the tying down, when i'm through they look just plain not right)  but now listening to all you brave women, who cares!  Thanks all!
