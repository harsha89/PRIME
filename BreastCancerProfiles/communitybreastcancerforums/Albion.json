The surgeon seems to think she can remove it via lumpectomy but I still have my concerns, she said the choice is mine but she is confident either way will be fine. Not sure how confident I am with such little to go on and still not enough info on my cancers grade or stage.",

My tumour however is huge, you can actually see it on my left breast close to the center of my chest at the 9'o clock position, when I lay down it looks like a grotesque monster. My breasts are rather large and dense as well. I have not had an MRI as of",

I have to wait until after surgery to find out if it has spread and so forth. The doctor will be removing lymph nodes as well. I just cannot make up my mind, I was thinking mastectomy and then I double guess myself and choose lumpectomy. Really do not know what would be best.",
