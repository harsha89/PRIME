I got a phone call from the breast center saying my biopsy was benign but that they did not see the microcalcifications in the tissue they think because I was bleeding so much so they want me to go back for a mamogram in a month to see if they are still there. I am so confused I swear she said she got the calcification during the biopsy. I was bleeding majorly does this mean another biopsy could I still have cancer the mamograms and ultrasounds and stuff have been going on for 2 months now isn't this bad if I have breast cancer? stressing",

I am so confused did they miss the area totally how could this happen. I went to a breast center that is highly recommended a hour away from my house for the biopsy to try to avoid mishaps like this. Since I dealt with issues like this before when I was almost miss diagnosed with thyroid cancer and ended up at the university of penn to find out I don't have thyroid cancer I decided I would go for the breast biopsy somewhere reputable instead of the small local hospital here that my dr recommended. And now this i am wondering what to think at this point. I don't even know what to tell everyone. Am I going to have to have another biopsy can they even do that with the marker there they placed in. I have other health issues going on right now too one that is affected by stress so this waiting is not good for me.",
