Days 1 and2 weren't too bad but days 3 and 4 knocked me on my butt. Feeling better now, just weak. Going back to work tomorrow, so I hope I'll be feeling better. Any idea of when my hair will start to fall out? What about lashes and brows? Hope everyone is doing well and feeling strong.",

Hair still falling out like crazy (I can't believe there's any left) but still haven't buzzed it yet. No one in family can bring themselves to do it (And my daughter is a hair dresser!) When can lashes and brows be expected to fall out? Last time, they didn't fall out until about 6 weeks after I finished chemo. I'm thinking about trying Latisse when chemo is over.   Hope everyone is doing well and feeling strong .                               Jennifer Q",

Had lumpectomy, 6 rounds of TAC and 33 rads. After 41/2 years, I thought I was through with this monster. Unfortunately, it returned in my left breast in November 2009. On Feb, 5, I had a bi- lat, MX with tissue expanders and have had 4 fills so far. Radiated side is very tight, but so far I've had over 200cc in. Started first of 4 rounds of TC on April 20.
