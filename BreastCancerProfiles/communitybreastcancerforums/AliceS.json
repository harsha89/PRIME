Others want to be supportive/positive to make us feel better--but we think they don't understand. When you think about it--what else can they say since they can't predict the future either. I'll probably never feel carefree again, (and I'm a born worrier anyway! :)-- but it does help to get involved, keep busy, live life, appreciate, most of the time. Hate to think years down the line if we're still here that we wasted all that time in fear and missed a lot of joy. Easier said than done for sure--but what else can we do but at least strive for that. Best wishes to all-- remember there are LOTS of positive stories out there. WE have the potential to be one of those!",

Know of so many success stories--I have lots of hope. I exercise regularly, have a healthy diet (mostly! :) and try to live a healthy lifestyle. Still have a glass of wine every night. Someone on one thread said--don't let the fear, worry, etc. ruin your life and happiness. That would mean that the cancer won! Hopefully, we have many many great years ahead! Good philosophy. ",

If not covered by Medicare, Blue Cross doesn't pay at all.  I am grateful, however, that all my surgery, Herceptin, Chemo, etc. etc. was totally covered.
