      "Content": "Apr 2, 2014 11:41AM - edited Apr 2, 2014 11:42AM by Mompv I was diagnosed on March 31 officially with IDC stage 2 grade 3. My dr. has decided to do chemo first to shrink the tumor. I do have an MRI scheduled on the 10th and an appt with her on the 14th. If the MRI comes back that it has not spread then we will go forward with just chemo for 6 months then a lumpectomy after that. If it has spread I am not sure what will happen.¬† Still in shock and am feeling depressed. I just keep thinking \"I can't do this!\" It is exhausting, all these emotions. I guess I need to just accept it and move forward. Good luck to all of you!!!",

I still have not heard a thing from my doctor!!! Anyway, I took the \"bull by the horns\" and called Roswell Cancer Institute.

Anyway, I am still waiting and worried. So, not only am I angry at my doctor for not calling me yet, I am petrified of the call.¬† What does blood flow to a lump mean along with it being solid?¬† Should I be freaking out???? I read things on here about all these different types of cancer and symtoms. I do not understand all the terms being used or the abbreviations.

      "Content": "Oct 13, 2014 12:54AM Mompv wrote: Hi all! I just thought I would check in here and offer some advice. Background first....I was diagnosed in march 2014 with stage 2 grade 3 Triple negative. Elected to have lumpectomy first followed by 4 AC treatments every 2 weeks then 4 treatments of Taxol every 2 weeks. I finished chemo on sept 18th and start radiation October 20th.¬† My advice is this....do not try and be superwoman! You will be tired. You will need help. Do not try to grin and bear it and act like everything is OK. You are fighting for your life!! Rest as much as possible. Everyone experiences SE differently. Hair loss happens and yes it sucks but in the scheme of things it is a small thing to bear. When my hair started coming out in clumps I had my DH shave my head.¬† I wore hats and scarves as wigs were hot. On the plus side I did not have to shave my legs or armpits....still don't but hair on my head is growing! Oh I lost pubic hair as well.¬† If you are taking neulasta shots try taking Claritan 2 days before and about 4 to 5 days after. Its not the claritan D. Always check with your oncologist before taking anything. I had people tell me before I started Taxol to take L-Glutamine for neuropathy. My oncologist said no. He sited research where some tumors could grow while taking. Some say OK so always ask!!!!! I guess my bottom line is this.....rest rest rest!!!! Drink lots of fluids. If water tastes bad try other things. I liked lemonade and chocolate milk. Some find Gatorade good. Eat what tastes good now is not the time to diet! You need energy your body is fighting.¬† If you are on the AC treatment, while they are doing the injection sip water it helps with the taste. Again do not try and grin and bear it and be superwoman.....rest. Do what you can of course but don't push beyond. I hope this helps. Good luck to all of you!!!!",

I was told to call over ANYTHING even if we think we can handle it. They take care of a lot of people and have see and heard everything. Although I was disappointed after my MO visit yesterday (after an 1 1/2 wait) that he had no answers for my overly spacey and tiredness I experienced last time.¬† I went ahead and¬† am working only 1/2 day today, came in at noon working til 4:30, so amazingly enough I slept til 7am, I am usually up at 5am. I feel better today than I did this time after the last infusion. I am monitoring the nausea. I took the steriods but not the prochor...something. I did take an ativan last night and they gave me one in the infusion room. I have been watching my fluid intake as well, I wonder if last time I didn't drink enough or sleep enough.¬† Anyway, funny story... Yesterday morning, I was just puttering around the house bald...and the bell rang, it was UPS. Poor guy did a double take. I bet I woke him up!!! Oh well this is life.¬† Tomorrow is Neulasta early..first in first out is the name of the game there. It is a very very busy place. I go the Roswell Cancer Institute here¬† in Buffalo, NY. They are the best in the area which why we wait. I have my last AC on July 24th then onto Taxol for 4 rounds every 2 weeks was the initial plan, we shall see.¬† Estimated finish date is Sept 18th.¬† I am gonna take cake and ballons to the infusion room.¬† The nurses are fantastic. It seems you all go weekly for 12 weeks. Then onto radiation everyday for 5 weeks...yikes!!!! May you all have lighter SE's hang in there....this boat will pull into the wellness harbor soon. Then let the party of our lives begin. It does shift your priorities in life. I am pondering them now... First on my list is to do more fun things with my wonderful¬† husband.¬† He even takes the time when we are in the infusion room to go visit people who are there alone! !!! He has been wonderful through all of this: laundry, I wash he take to laundry mat to dry, yep our dryer broke can't afford to replace yet with those pesky medical bills looming over our head. He cooks every meal...but he is the better cook, my thing is baking. 2nd would be my girls, when they have time in their busy lives. Work on my children's books I have going. Doesn't show here but I love writing stories for children, I have many in progress. I want to work on them now while I have a lot of sit time, but my brain does not cooperate...it seems to be bouncing down the freeway somewhere wanting a vacation...maybe on a beach...salt air, wave crashing...ahhhhhh the relaxation dream...... Ok gone on to long..back to work!!!!!",

Feels like I am walking on balls and my legs feel like dead weights. I already whined on another board and feel guilt about doing it again. I am just exhausted. I tried to work normally and took only treatment day and some 1/2 days off. Looking back that was a mistake, I should have taken more time to rest. So, I am leaving work early today, and am taking at least Monday and Tuesday off next week. Friday I will work for couple hours and thats it!!!! It took me all this time to realize I really needed to take care of myself and not worry so much about work. So, if anyone is lurking out there who is starting chemo soon. TAKE TIME TO REST!!!!
