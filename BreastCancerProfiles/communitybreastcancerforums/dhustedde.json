I'm on Day 10 since my 1st Chemo and feeling much better than this time last week. My muscle pain has pretty much stopped. I've still been taking the Claritin and am afraid to stop taking it. My energy level is better but not 100%. My taste is a little better too. I still have to eat small meals and often. On thing is that I still have stomach issues and the big D. Seems like when I eat it goes right through me. How long is that supposed to last I wonder. My next treatment is Dec 11th so I'm hoping to get some things done while I feel better.",

I was good, except for a funny taste in my mouth until Saturday. Saturday and Sunday I was extremely tired, bad muscle pain in my hips and not able to eat alot I never got nausea's. I did take the Claritan but the muscle pain has been bad. I'm on day 6 and starting to feel normal except for the muscle pain and funny taste in my mouth. My chemo is T/C. Anyone know if the next treatment will effect me worse or the same or be better?",

The initial biopsy report said: -invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1 of 3, 0.9 CM current specimen -DCIS, intermediate nuclear grade without necrosis -ER positive, PR negative and HER-2/neu negative by immunohistochemical stain Yesterday I had a lumpectomy and SNB (right). Now it's the waiting on the pathology to see where we go from here. The BS, Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist all say that as long as nothing changes and there is no lymph node involvement I should be able to do the internal radiation and then taking a pill after that.  I guess I'm just worried its not going to be that easy, but I guess that's normal.  Dx 7/3/2014, DCIS, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Good news, bad news.  It didn't spread to the lymph nodes, but there is a small area that doesn't have clear margins. I go in Monday for the re-excision. Now my BS feels like there may not be enough space left after this second surgery to do the internal radiation.  He said we'll see when he's done and how the pathology comes back but it may have to be the full breast radiation. That's a little disappointing but seeing as the lymph nodes are not envolved I'm extremely happy!  Just more surgery and waiting on another pathology report.  Ugh!  ",
