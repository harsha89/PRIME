I also have no identified cancer although it does run in my family and I am BRCA1+. All tests, imaging and screening were done prior and everything came back clear. I did nipple and skin sparring, they said I was a great candidate because I was not yet diagnosed. I did straight to implant. I think it help also that I was not going very big for recon. I am very flat chested and have a tiny frame, I'm only 5' and went to a B. I personally decided this one was the one I wanted to do (after given the options) because I wanted to be one and done ( of course I know things can go wrong and would take any precaution I would need if necessary) I personally didn't want to go through expanders or extra recovery for the flap.  I wish I could help more about long term however its only been a week for me. best of luck!",
