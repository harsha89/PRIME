If the breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the underarm area (the axillary nodes) or you've been diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer, you may need tests for metastases. The 3 main tests are: Positron emission tomography (PET) and other tests for metastases may be done, depending on your symptoms and the findings from the three main tests.",

This is almost certainly due to reduced immune surveillance secondary to lymphatic dysfunction. Recurrent cellulitis or lymphangitis is a particular problem.

      "Content": "Jun 3, 2017 12:17PM marijen wrote: by Healthy Cures Although the lymphatic system is often overlooked, it is essential part of the body. It is made of tissues and organs that work in synergy to flush out toxic matter, waste, and other unwanted materials from the system. Given that the lymph fluid contains white blood cells which have critical role in fighting off infections, keeping a healthy lymphatic system is of utmost importance. Common Symptoms Of A Congested Lymphatic System  Three Major Causes Of Lymphatic Congestion Even though lymphatic congestion is triggered by a wide range of factors, everything can be narrowed down to three major causes. 3-Day Lymphatic Detox To Improve Lymph Health If you experience at least three of the symptoms outlined above, you`ll need to do a lymphatic detox to improve your lymph health. The good news is that you need only three days to drain your lymphatic fluids! Read through the following guidelines and prepare yourself, particularly for the rebounding exercise which is a great way to drain your stagnant fluids. Drink herbal tea during the detox period, take a detox bath, dry skin brush, drink plenty of water, and do some brisk walking. You`ll feel the difference in a matter of days! 1. Drink Plenty of Fluid Since the lymph is made of nearly 95 percent water, water is critical for its health. Therefore, make sure you stay hydrated by drinking half your weight in ounces of water daily in order to avoid improper lymph flow. In addition to water, you can have freshly-squeezed juices, broths, and herbal teas, all of which help the lymphatic system move while mineralizing the body and the lymph. It is worth mentioning that green vegetable juices are one of those good-for-you beverages which do deep cleanse of all detox organs, including the lymphatic system. 2. Herbs There are many lymph-supporting herbs which have been shown to improve lymphatic health, whether in facilitating the elimination of toxic matter or improving lymphatic drainage. Some of those herbs include: \u2013 Red root ( It helps reduce cysts, reduce swollen nodes, send nutrition to the tissues, and alleviate the stagnation of fluids) \u2013 Red clover ( It improves circulation, which in turn reduces inflammation and promotes detoxification of the body) \u2013 Manjistha ( This Ayurvedi herb is used to alleviate the stagnation of fluids by promoting lymph flow) \u2013 Echinacea ( It boosts immunity by detoxifying the lymph fluid and it invades tumor cells and increases the production of T-lymphocyte, cells needed for clearing up extra-cellular fluids) \u2013 Cleavers ( It helps dissolve cysts, reduces the swelling of lymph nodes, and helps dissolve kidney stones) To sum up, drinking these herbal teas helps detoxify the lymph and boost its function. 3. Exercise Rebounding is the best type of exercise for detoxifying the lymphatic system. It involves jumping on a trampoline and it works by opening up the lymphatic valves and improving circulation. It is recommended to do this for 15-20 minutes on a daily basis. 4. Near Infrared Sauna This therapy penetrates into the skin, promoting sweating and elimination of toxic matter. The release of toxins and the heat work in synergy to improve the lymphatic flow. 5. Brisk Walking Brisk walking is simple, yet effective way to get the body moving and stimulate lymph flow. Aim at getting about 45-60 minutes a day, while breathing as deeply as possible. 6. Legs Up The Wall Lying with your legs up the wall enhances the lymphatic flow by stimulating the activation of the lymphatic valves for eliminating toxins. Plus, it helps sleep better at night, too. 7. Lymphatic Drainage Massage  8. Standing Desk Sitting down is bad for the lymphatic flow, while standing desk promotes lymphatic drainage and ensures you get more natural movements throughout the day. 9. Hydrotherapy Shower Hydrotherapy shower involves use of hot and cold water alternatively. At the end of the shower, switch the water from hot to cold very quickly. Repeat a few times! 10. Deep Breathing Being quite simple, deep breathing is something anyone can do. But, it`s an effective way of stimulating lymph flow, since the lungs are the ones that pump your lymphatic fluid. \u2013 Stretch the arms to both sides and then move the arms up while breathing through the nose. Then, use your hands to make circles and breathe deeply from the lung, not the stomach. Hold the breath for a few seconds. \u2013 Move the arms down while exhaling through the mouth and making circles with the hands \u2013 You are likely to feel a bit dizzy after doing this for a few times, which indicates that your body is eliminating toxic matter. Stop at this point! While doing this, think: 'wash the cells, feed the cells, purify the cells' to help pump out the toxins.' 11. Dry Skin Brushing Dry skin brushing provides a wide range of health benefits, from improving lymphatic flow and optimizing detoxification to boosting organ functions and boosting energy levels. Here's How To Dry Brush ",

They are testing a anti-inflammatory medication that is already on the market, but not designated for lymphedema. So far there is no cure for lymphedema. Lymphedema has three stages, the earlier it is caught the better chance of reversal.",

Good that you have antibiotics already. Report this Post Nov 10, 2017 02:47PM Binney4 wrote: I'm so sorry this has flared up now--bummer! If your doctor is not available today, please go right away to the ER, because what you're describing may be cellulitis, a skin infection that can spread rapidly and needs IMMEDIATE treatment. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Med... It could also be the onset of truncal (breast/chest) lymphedema, which does often present this way. Lymphedema is an inflammatory condition and in the breast in particular can take the form of tightness and redness. The redness can be from the lymphedema, but since it's not possible to determine that right away, YOU NEED TO GET MEDICAL HELP AT ONCE IN CASE IT IS AN INFECTION INSTEAD. If antibiotics don't reduce the redness, that's an indication of lymphedema. The next step would be to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist and get started on the gentle massage treatment and compression that will get it back into control. If you're still reading this, please stop and get to your doctor or ER now! And do, please, keep us posted and let us know how you're doing. Gentle hugs, Binney",

The PTs wouldn't touch it because they thought it was cancer. One Dr. Prescribed antibiotics, that didn't get rid of the swelling, peau d'orange, deep redness and pain, so they tried prednisone. At that point I saw my new MO and she ordered the CEA test which has been out of range for a year. So it was justified to give the scans. Plus I had an occult primary never found and an enlarged lymph node in my good armpit. But it doesn't light up. With that I began feeling aches from that area which I will tell her about this week. It's the never ending testathon in my case. The pet scan showed thyroid nodules and lung fibrosis f rom. Radiation. Sorry keyboard is acting up. I also had an IBC biopsy.

Science News from research organizations Heligmosomoides polygyrus (a nematode) was used as a gastrointestinal parasitic model to understand the mechanism behind lymph node lymphangiogenesis. Credit: Lalit Kumar Dubey/EPFL Credit: Lalit Kumar Dubey/EPFL  Lymph nodes are small, kidney-shaped organs found throughout the body. Full of immune cells, their function is to clear out foreign objects and support the immune system. Lymph nodes communicate with the tissues and with each other through the lymphatic vessels, which carry fluids and objects from the tissues and back out to the bloodstream. Normally, lymphatic vessels grow during the embryo stage, but also in adults during wound healing, cancer, and inflammation. But the exact mechanism of this \"lymphangiogenesis\" is yet unknown. EPFL scientists have now identified the molecules that signal the growth of lymphatic vessels during worm infections. The work is published in Nature Communications. The lymphatic vessels drain pathogens from tissues to the collecting lymph nodes, where immune responses begin. They also allow lymphocytes and dendritic cells -- which expose pathogen material to trigger the immune system -- to flow in and out of the lymph nodes. Because of this, lymphangiogenesis is important for immune responses against infections. But recent studies have shown that lymphangiogenesis can also regulate immune responses during inflammation. This connection between inflammation and lymphangiogenesis is key in our understanding of the adaptive immune response, which is the slower but more specialized wave against infections and involves T and B cells. The lab of Nicola Harris at EPFL looked at the mesenteric lymph node, which collects fluids and objects from the intestine of mice. The research, led by Lalit Kumar Dubey, follows a 2016 paper from the group, which showed how worm infection stimulates B cells to 'talk' to the endothelial cells of the mesenteric lymph node and kickstart an immune response.",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2017 07:00PM - edited Aug 1, 2017 07:01PM by marijen New research has uncovered brain cells that become activated in response to uncertain outcomes. In a study of monkeys, Ilya Monosov, Ph.D., of the Departments of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, MO, discovered specific cells in the brain that are activated in response to anxiety. The researcher recently published his findings in the journal Nature Communications. In simple terms, anxiety is defined as feelings of worry, nervousness, or fear about an event or situation that could yield an unpleasant outcome, such as a job interview or an exam. While these feelings may quickly subside for some people, others may develop anxiety disorders, wherein anxiety persists or worsens over time. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders affect around 40 million adults in the United States. Dr. Monosov believes that his new study may open the door to new treatments for anxiety disorders, after identifying a group of brain cells that play a role in anxious feelings. Dr. Monosov came to his findings by studying the brains of rhesus monkeys, which have many brain structures similar to those of humans. He focused on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the brain, a region in the prefrontal cortex that previous studies have shown plays a role in behaviors associated with uncertainty - a key driver of anxiety. For his study, Dr. Monosov trained two monkeys to associate three different geometric patterns with three different outcomes. One pattern was associated with receiving an irritating puff of air in the face (representing a certain outcome), one pattern was associated with a 50-50 likelihood of getting a puff of air in the face (representing an uncertain outcome), while the third pattern was associated with no outcome. As the monkeys were shown each geometric pattern, Dr. Monosov used MRI to measure neuronal activity in the ACC of their brains. The researcher identified brain cells in the ACC that were activated in response to the geometric design associated with an uncertain outcome. However, when the monkeys were shown patterns associated with a certain outcome or no outcome, these brain cells showed no activity. \"We found a population of neurons that activated specifically when monkeys thought something bad or annoying - like a puff of air to the face - might be coming, but not when they knew for certain it was,\" explains Dr. Monosov. In another experiment, Dr. Monosov trained the monkeys to recognize two geometric patterns associated with the certainty or possibility of receiving a sip of juice, representing a positive outcome. The results were similar to those seen in the first experiment: when the monkeys were presented with an uncertain outcome, a specific group of brain cells in the ACC were activated. These cells were not activated when the monkeys were presented with the certain outcome. According to Dr. Monosov, these findings not only help to explain the brain mechanisms that underlie anxiety, but they may also pave the way for new treatments for anxiety and other behavioral disorders. www.medicalnewstoday.com ",

The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial were first reported in 2005 with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Longer follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor-positive tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology). To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is noninferior to that of women treated with axillary dissection. The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and community medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases. All patients had planned lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited. The primary outcome was overall survival with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival. Among 891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) completed the trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93-10.34 years), the 10-year overall survival was 86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95% CI, 0-1.16]; noninferiority P = .02). The 10-year disease-free survival was 80.2% in the SLND alone group and 78.2% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62-1.17]; P = .32). Between year 5 and year 10, 1 regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group. Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These findings do not support routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on 10-year outcomes. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00003855.",

And then finally I was informed that I'm on a low dose! Really? for an occult tumor they are going to lightly radiate the general area and a very positive lymph node (lightly dose that area too?) What am I doing this for?? 33 treatments of a low dose with invasive metastatic to the lymph node? And you only get to do radiation once? #13 today. Won't see the RO until Tuesday. Now I am good and upset. That's what I get for telling them I feel nauseas? Disbelief?? Bought myself a piece of cake! So there!",

They are being so accommodating and agreed that I have very red and bumpy. Told to stick with Calendula three times a day and can use cortisone or calamine at night over to help with itching. 5 boosts and 8 whole breast zaps to go, I can see the end of the tunnel - there's light out there!! And a little more Ativan for nausea and sleep. What I'm most happy about is this all ends on Good Friday. A few weeks latter new mammogram. Am I done yet? Am I done yet?

Both burn when there is a rash and I've stopped using them I've moved on to Welenda (at Amazon) it's mostly zinc oxide but has to be washed off hours before rads. Good for night time. I put it on the rash thick. If it's still itching, I put calamine on top with a cotton ball, dab it on, let it dry. If it's still itch or pain and burn, I put lidocaine in the worst area right before sleep. No thanks to aqufor now but it was good when I had burning and numbness in my arm after surgery for some strange reason. When I shower I let it dry for a while before I add the Welenda. I'm also taking a zinc tab because it's good for the skin 50mg. I use olive oil soap or hospital soap or RO said cetafil - I didn't like it, or Dove - haven't tried that. I don't like soapy soap. Miaderm is very soothing but has Calendala in it. It's good if there is no broken skin.",

I guess that means she thinks it's all in my head? I thought it was good news when she agreed the radiation could cause nausea, although she's only had one other patient in 8 years that had this SE. At this point I'd rather wait and hope it goes away. Anyone here know if Medicare covers acupuncture for radiation? I'm thinking not since they don't offer it in general. I asked about taking Letrozole during radiation. RO wants me to continue with it but it can cause additional swelling with the combination so if that starts to happen she will take me off it until radiation is over. Thought you people might be interested in that little nugget. Haven't seen anyone else post it. Now I'm wondering IF there is increased swelling would that trigger LE?",

Do cheat but.... sugared sodas also seem to make me even more thirsty. Have cut way back on sugar for at least a year now. It helps me feel good about myself. I'll check on the ginger ale aisle next time I go to market and Reed's Jamaican, Vernor's just for the heck of it - they made the old cream soda? Blue Sky and Bruce Cost if they're there. Thanks Chisandy! Sometimes I buy 100% cherry juice, or cranberry and dilute. It's expensive, less sugar if you buy the right kind and a little splash in carbonated or ice water is all it takes for a tasty refresher. In the morning first thing, I do fresh lemon and hot water. It seems to me my labs are improving since I started. Doctors put a lot of stock in labs. Been doing that since spring. Little changes go a long way. Eating and drinking healthy can be fun.",

It's over a year later I went out for 30 min walk yesterday. It warmed up while I was walking. Took my sweater off but still came home with a big red breast. Also have lung fibrosis and thyroid nodules since radiation. At least 20 PT visits and still need more. Also two months after radiation I got delayed breast cellulitis which resulted in a lot of testing, antibiotics, prednisone. If I had it to do over I don't think so....",

Snow and rain and freezing temps don't help. I'm not looking forward to radiation even though that will be the end of it for a bit. Yearly mammo exam coming up in April.",

We went over the risks - here they are: Fatigue, redness/burning/blistering of skin, breast swelling/tenderness, skin thickening, rib fragililty, chest wall pain from tightening of muscle - treatable, arm swelling (lymphedema)brachial nerve injury less than 1% probable, lung scarring, 3-5% possibility (fever, cough, shortness of breath - fully treatable, pneumonitis - treatable, loss of sweat glands axilla, radiation induced cancer - rare. No heart risk for me because radiation on right side. I do like the RO and her nurse. They are setting me up with PT for shoulder mobility and lymphedema evaluation. I am on reclast so hopefully rib fragility won't be a problem...? RO said it will lower my risk for recurrence by 2/3 or 66%. I requested sharpie marker with clear tape instead of tattoos - Chisandy thanks and does it itch? They say Calendula CREAM only from FIRST AID. No ointments no lotions.....but I have two bottles of Aloe, two jars of aquaphor, miaderm with lidocaine, and Vaseline! ",

      "Content": "Feb 23, 2018 12:28PM marijen wrote: Mammogram or MRI for breast screening? In recent years, there has been a perception that many more patients were being screened with MRI scans compared with mammograms. The concern, of course, is how good are MRIs compared with mammograms? This paper evaluated 812,164 patients with over 2 million images from 2003 to 2013. The good news is that we are not overusing MRI scans. When they looked at patients with PHBC (personal history of breast cancer), only 4673 had MRIs out of 101,103 images that were done. For patients without PHBC, there were only 3149 MRIs vs over 1.9 million mammograms. So, MRI usage is not excessive. However, there was a higher biopsy rate for the patients who had MRI scans vs mammograms. For patients with PHBC, the MRI group had 6.3% (n = 236) biopsies vs 2.2% (n = 2231) for the mammogram group. For patients without PHBC, the biopsy rate following MRI was 10.5% (n = 489) vs 1.6% (n = 30 757). So basically, MRI did result in more biopsies. Most likely, this was because more abnormal lesions could be seen on MRI scans compared with mammograms. But the key question is whether MRIs pick up more cancers with these extra biopsies. Sadly, the answer is no. For patients with PHBC, the MRIs had less detected cancers on the biopsies than mammograms (MRI, 267.6 [95%CI, 208.0-337.8] vs mammography, 404.6 [95% CI, 381.2-428.8]). For the patients with no PHBC, the trend was the same but it did not reach statistical significance. Now, we do have to be careful not to conclude that MRI is not worthwhile. Think about this example of comparing physical exam vs mammograms. Palpable breast lumps on physical examination would have a higher chance of being cancerous. On the other hand, mammograms would show the cancer lesions, but they would also see many other lesions that are not cancerous. Now, if we sent all those lesions for biopsies then many of them would come back as not cancer. Hence, mammograms would have fewer biopsies that are positive compared to the palpable lump strategy. Now, of course, we would never conclude that mammograms are not good based on this comparison. So perhaps the MRI is also seeing a lot of interesting abnormalities and many are not cancerous. So the real trick is to identify which abnormalities are cancerous and which are not. With mammography, the readings have improved so much that we are able to separate out important versus non-important lesions. The same learning curve needs to happen with MRIs. In this review, there over 2 million images but less than 8000 were MRIs. So we need a bit more time for the learning curve for MRIs. This curve could possibly be sped up by setting up a good feedback loop. If for each MRI scan there was feedback as to what the lesion ultimately was, then that would speed up that learning curve. Imagine if for every MRI image we knew what the outcomes where, then we would be able to identify which lesions are important or not. This feedback loop on just a few thousand MRI images could dramatically shorten the learning curve. For now, the good news is that most of the patients were not being screened with MRI and as the authors of the paper suggested, we do need to come up with a list of criteria for patients that would benefit from MRI in addition to mammography. But ultimately, we need to learn what are important lesions on an MRI scan and what are not. JAMA internal med. 2/23/201",

If the new one had just have not wrapped you so tight, everything would have been ok? Maybe you can sleep on it and call her in the morning? You should be able to be straight with her, see if she gets defensive? Maybe her answer will surprise you? There is also a new third choice, unknown as of now. Sometimes the answer just comes in the middle of the night. The first one isn't much help if you can't see her for weeks or talk to her because she's so busy. You weren't happy anyways. I'm sure you'll get some more help with this.",
