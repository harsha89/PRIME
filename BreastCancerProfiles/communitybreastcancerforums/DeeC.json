The top is very wavy. I wonder what it will do as it gets longer. On the wig question, I bought a wig and used it when I left the house. I did not think I looked good with my wispy hair. When my hair grew to cover my scalp, no pink showing, I stopped wearing it. I felt self-conscious at first. Now I am enjoying my 'new' hair. This to shall pass...and it did!  Dee ",
