I recently found out I have brain tumors (April 3) and had 10 sessions of a whole brain scan with decadron to help with inflammation. I actually really liked the decadron, gave me lots of energy and optimism. (although my face is now sort of moon shaped!) This is the second time I have tried to wean off of it, cutting down to half a pill every other day and have had severe headaches each time I reached the day of no pill. So went back on it the first time for two more weeks (that is what the doctor suggested) and this morning took a half a pill, even though I was suppose to not take one, I was so miserable. Is the headache a side effect of the weaning and if I just stick it out, the headache will subside? Kind of like when you try to give up coffee. (which I never have successfully done)  I called my doctor and am waiting for him to call me back. ",
