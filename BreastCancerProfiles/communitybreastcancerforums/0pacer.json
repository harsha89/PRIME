But what is in between those tumours is uncertain. That's exactly what the surgeon told us today. ILC is sneaky and is often larger than expected. My Mom had initially decided to go with the mastectomy with reconstructive plastic surgery where they take tissue from her abdomen and put it on where the mastectomy took place; however she's reconsidering because of the potentially longer recovering period. The nurse also said she can have the mastectomy and choose to do the reconstructive surgery later. For me, the most important thing is having the surgery and getting the cancer out. Were you able to feel your any of your 4 tumours? My Mom didn't feel a thing. That's why this is so shocking. Claude",

I just got in contact with a nurse who specializes in caring for breast cancer patients. She is in close contact with the cancer care centre. She looked at my Moms report and she said it appears to be two tiny masses that are 8mm. Which is less than half an inch. She said it's the type of cancer that grows slowly. She said that it appears to be early. That's reassuring. She's and us kids will be meeting with the surgeon tomorrow to discuss her treatment options. This surgeon is excellent according to many. Also, does it matter if the cancer is deep? Or is it more the size of the tumour that's important? Thanks guys Claude",

Thanks nihahi for giving me advice regarding breast reconstruction. It is my Mom's decision and I think she's pretty much decided to go for the breast reconstruction right away. I always said whatever she decides is good with me. My Mom is 65 and she is pretty strong. She walks at least 6km on most days. She is retired. It's funny, I have an aunt who was diagnosed with ILC in 2012 at the age of 65. She did the reconstruction and went through chemo and radiation. It's been 4 years and no cancer. Thank God for her. She's a good support. They are married to brothers; there's no relation between them. I'll keep you all posted. Claude",

There she will have a good idea when the surgery date will be. I think she's pretty much decided to go through with this. After about a week of not sleeping well, she had a good 7 hours last night. Her doctor prescribed her sleeping pills; something she has never taken up until now. She also did clothes shopping with my sister for post surgery. They also got a small table with two drawers to put surgical gloves, gauze, bandages etc. My Aunt went though the same procedure in 2012 and she said after meeting with the plastic surgeon and doing tests, you will arrive at the surgery date in no time. The ball has started rolling and we're getting prepared day by day. Claude",

We can expect a call next week and we can anticipate that the surgery will take place at the end of September or early October. There they will examine her sentinel lymph node. The surgeon did a physical exam to check her lymph nodes. They aren't swollen or anything, which is a good thing. My Mom is emotional right now. I'm praying for the best. Anyone else have gone through this type of cancer. I'd like any advice. Thanks. I'll keep you all posted.",
