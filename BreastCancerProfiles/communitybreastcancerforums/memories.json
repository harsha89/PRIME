I've placed a call to the surgeon to see if someone can call me to explain. I have an ultrasound scheduled for this Thursday for one of the new masses we found, so hopefully it will be nothing and I can ease my mind a little. I probably won't have answers on anything else until 7/22 when I go back to meet with the surgeon after all the specialists have met on my case to determine the best plan of treatment. I really wish I could have the other mass that was detected on the MRI biopsied now. As so many other people write on these boards...the waiting game is sooooo very hard! As of now I'm being told that I shouldn't have to have chemo. It appears that they've learned so much about bc that the treatments options are much better today. I'm so glad that you've been blessed with being cancer free 15 yrs. that is awesome!!! You are such an inspiration to me. Our family has been through so much and God keeps pulling us through the tough times, so I know I have to keep my faith that God will be there for me now. Thanks for the prayers!",

      "Content": "memories wrote: I had a followup appointment today one week after a lumpectomy. The pathologist report came back as Intracystic (encapsulated) Papillary Carcinoma (IPC) and Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS). I thought for sure that I was going to go in and find out that they had gotten everything during surgery and they would just need me to followup on a regular basis. Normally I'm very detailed and ask lots of questions of the drs.; however, today I seemed to be shocked with all the information. I've research the DCIS, but I'm not exactly sure what it means to have IPC and DCIS. The doctor did say that we caught it early. Are both of these non-invasive? What does it mean to have both diagnoses? I've got another mass that was found in the other breast during an MRI, but they we're going to followup again in 6 mths. Now they will probably biopsy it as well. The day before my surgery, I found another mass that the surgeon thought was probably fatty tissue. The doctor today felt it without me mentioning it and plans to ultrasound it to be sure. From what I know now, I will have to have surgery again since they didn't get enough of a clear margin. Then I will have 6 weeks of daily radiation and after the radiation I will go on medication (tomoxifin?). All of this information is overwhelming. I believe my diagnosis has great success. However, from some of the information I've read it appears that you have a greater chance of invasive cancer if you've had DCIS. Is this true? I guess I'm very concerned because I still have two lumps that haven't been diagnosed yet. Please provide me info... Thanks, Kathi Log in to post a reply",

Thanks for all the information and words of encouragement. Anne, thanks for providing me the information that you found. Rare is always the case in our family, so I guess having another rare thing is normal for me. Kuchagirl, I appreciate you sharing your story of IPC with me. It helps to hear from someone who actually went through a similar experience. You're such an inspiration and it is exciting that you're doing so well. I'm getting a little more nervous because I went to the genetic oncologist yesterday and she mentioned that they may even consider a masectomy since I have a rare gene \"fanconi\" which acts like the breast cancer gene. My 8 year old daughter passed away in 2002 with fanconi anemia so our doctors recently had us following up with a genetic oncologist due to the higher risks of cancers. She is supposed to get in touch with the genetic specialist for fanconi to discuss my DNA makeup. My case will be discussed at a tumor conference on 7/18 and then I have an appointment with the surgeon on 7/22 to discuss the plan of treatment. I had a little scare last night because under my scar (from an excision on 6/22) I had a large mass appear. Thankfully, the nurse practioner could fit me in this morning to check it out. She said that it is scardoma (sp?) which is fluid buildup in the area that was left empty from taking the mass out. Since I'll more than likely have surgery soon she doesn't want to mess with it unless it starts causeing problems. I didn't get any sleep last night because I was worried that I had a new growth. I'm so thankful that it wasn't. Well, the waiting game is hard...I'm going to try and focus on other things for the next week so I don't drive myself crazy. Everyone on the site has been so supportive, I certainly hope that I'll be just as encouraging and supportive to others one day. Thanks!!!",
