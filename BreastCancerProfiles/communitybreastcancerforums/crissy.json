I have been told that a bad cough or pneumonia could cause small nodules in the lung.  My radiologist says it's normal to see nodules smaller than 6mm.  However, if bone mets are shrinking...sit back and smile.  You're feeling good, so don't worry if they are lung mets or not. Keep living your life! Crissy ",
