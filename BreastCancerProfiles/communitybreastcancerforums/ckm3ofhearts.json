I met with my medical oncologist on the 24th and she said with all of the characteristics of my cancer, she wanted to send my tumor off to California to have the Oncotype Dx test done to it.  Has anyone had this test? I am kind of freaked out. In the beginning while faced with the decision of lumpectomy and radiation vs. bilateral mastectomy, that was the hardest decision and if the results of this test come back with a low number, I'm going to have to make another hard decision. I don't want to! I was ready for chemo and was fully expecting to have it started by next week. Her plan for my chemo treatments would be 12 weeks of Adriamycin, and Cytoxan (sp?) and then 12 weeks of Taxotere. I hope I said those right. So that's a really long time, but geesh, these decisions are very hard and was just hoping that I could get opinions from you all.  It is much appreciated.   Carolyn Dx 11/13/2009, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
