I  was the 1st patient to trial a new cream called MIADERM.. and everyone at the cancer center is in awe of how well my skin looks. No burn at all and just a slight red/tan look to my skin if that.. I put it on immediately after the  treatment  in the dressing room( i think this is important) apply 4 times a day total  and not within 2 hours of my treatment. I used no soap/deodorant at all to my skin. Ha, I actually didn't smell!!  I'm taking Biotin a supplement for hair, skin and nails which may have helped??  I cross bridges when I get to them and I think that has really helped.. I have been blessed as I have felt no side effects from radiation!! Good Luck with you 2nd round of radiation and  great news you don't need chemo!",

I don't use any soap/deodorant at all and the hydrocortisone works great for the itch!( My husband is a pharmacist) Your skin/nipple condition  sounds similar to mine .. I think you'll do fine. Just stay on top of applying the cream 4 times/day.  good Luck with you last 8 rads!!",
