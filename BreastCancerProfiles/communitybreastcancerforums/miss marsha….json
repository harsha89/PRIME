I do not think you will be dismissed and if you are remember this... You have the right to direct your own health care the Dr. you choose works for YOU! It sounds to me like it could be masstitis, which is an infection in your duct works, it can be very painfiul. It is more common for new mothers but also can happen if you have been at high altitudes or traveling on airplanes, sometimes women get it for no apparent reason at all! It will not go away without treatment. PLEASE! Save yourself the worry and make an appt! I'm going to want to know what the outcome is. You can update here or send me a private message!            Marsha",
