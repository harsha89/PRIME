Her CEA TM was 255 when she started CMF, the last tuesday it was 47, the scanner showed improvements so we cross fingers for continuous improvement, of course the same for you! Good luck!! wishing the best!",

It seems to be working, although her transaminases are quite high and she has stopped her chemo at least 2 weeks. My mums mets are pleural and mediastine so we are hoping its \"only\" a SE of all her treatments",
