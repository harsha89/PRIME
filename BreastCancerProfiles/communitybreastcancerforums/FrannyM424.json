Please send positive vibes my way for clear margins this time. Part of me just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable since surgeon says my DCIS is multi-focal and diffuse.  Surgeon and radiologist seem concerned that they won't be able to get it all on 2nd attempt but they're willing to try.  This just sucks.  I was off last week from work and I'm now looking at 2 more weeks off.  I'm a physical therapist and can't work with a 10lb. lifting restriction.  If I need mastectomy, that will be 6 more weeks off.  All unpaid.  At least with FMLA I won't lose my job.  All the other wonderful things we have to worry about along with the breast cancer, huh?!?  :)",

Said should be fine but they'll drain with a needle if it gets too full & painful.  Anyone else have this issue after lumpectomies? ",

So I have experience working with women post-op who have had mastectomies and various reconstructions.  I am acutely aware that these are major surgeries with the risk of a multitude of post-op complications.  Again, that just seems so drastic for DCIS.  Am I the exception for feeling this way???  There are so many very recent articles about how advanced mammography has become and how that is contributing to BC being over-diagnosed and over-treated.  It feels like I am living that exact scenario right now and it's making me really question how much more aggressively I want to treat this...",
