The kinesio had 2 holes for my fingers which acted much like  rings and made my finger swell more.  She had given me another pc. and suggested I merely cut those holes bigger, but I didnt like the fact the tape went all the way to my wrist and also  just having the holes around my fingers seemed ' not good ' somehow. Gotta run- too hard to articulate all this !",

Thanks for the tip on the taping As for the kinesio, I am still not a BIT comfortable with the idea of it being  around my finger in *any* way, under any circumstance. I dont quit understand why she can't  gently 'pull' the skin ( as in MLD) and then put the tape there.  I dunno'. I will ask the next time I see her. One thing I have (finally ) learned is , I will not let ANYONE do ANYTHING to me that I just dont feel comforatble with. Doesnt make sense. Musical If I do get a  taping that I am okay with, I will post a  pic. MUSICAL...are you wearing a  watch on your LE arm ?  (IF SO, pls re-consider.)",

Linda I know my reaction was (is) the same as yours.  VERY typical in these cases.  IF you trust your LEist (you can always seek a 2nd opinion) I would think that % volume reduction is good FOR NOW, but hope/expect more. We are all VERY different. I jst dont think there is a 'typical' really.   I do not wrap, but I do know it should not be so tight as to hurt, that's for sure.  My ins co,. did not have place  that sold sleeves  covered 100% so I ended up calling one of the DMEs for Respiratory Infusion Therapy who sold compression stockings  (My ins.  covers this DME  Co. at 100%) and  I made an appt and asked if they would order sleeves.  They said yes! Plan for a ' daytime sleeve' to last app. 4-6 months time .  Ideally, you should wash daily. I did suggest an IMAK ACTIVE ( www.amazon.com) just to have as  a spare glove or until you can get a new Rx one that you like the fit of. ALSO- my ins did not want to cover my Farrow glove ( at 80%) because they said they do not cover internet orders.  I told them I ordered by phone  (TRUE) through a (virtual) catalogue at www.brightlifedirect.com and they reimbursed me 80%  since it is out of network. Thats okay.   It stinks to have to haggle this way, but we do need garments and the more the better, I say ( for being able to have things clean and ready!) Hands are tricky and it is tough to say if wrapping or a glove would be best.  I think a real ' expert\" (LEist) wrap might prove better than a glove, but if I ( as a total novice) were to wrap , I would expect better results from my Farrow until I really learned. Still, we are all different so I am afraid that just may be trial and error. (Sorry-  I hate hearing that phrase when it comes to LE...) Also- I pay out of pocket for my LEist as  the two big area  LE clinics I went to did not perfom MLD on me. It does add up so get all you can from your INS! Hope this helps for now.",

Getting the arm waaaaay down is a 'realistic' expectation !  Improving funtion over time , gradually , is also realistic!  The emotional part is the toughest - I know all too well, but hang in there . You have come to the best of the best support groups ! The stepupspeakout link will help you more than anything, but I suggest you visit the \" all things sleeves andf gloves\" ( or is it glove and sleeves?  :>)  right here on this LE thread.  You may find it helpful as it surely sounds as though you might benefit from a  glove.  I love my Farrow glove, but  everyone is different.  Checking out that thread may  help to at least  show you what the possible options are. As for the swelling and fx of the arm, your best help wiill be your LE therapist as well as your own MLD, twice daily and compliance with your regimen of hydration and eventually, exercise (WITH sleeve and glove on).  For that, you may want to visit the exercise forum here since you will want to understand how to go into it gradually,  Additionally, a new and comprehensive document on exercise was recently written by one of the ladies here ( a project of Carol57) and is posted on the stepup site. I have  a feeling that once you have soaked in all of that info ( which is a LOT) you will see there are concrete steps you can take to manage and control this, and  eventually hope will emerge!  in the meantime, go easy on yourself.  It does take time.

The *ONLY* reason ( I am aware of ) that  the recommendation has stopped by some  is strictly due to risk of  injury.  Having said that - be careful !  (DOH) Either use one with a handlebar or place near a  wall where you can gently hang on with your good arm now and then.  My LE'ist also suggested I might open and close my fist now and then as I have hand swelling. I use  ' slipper socks' when I walk/bounce.  I honestly believe the rebounder works. I would like to build up more time on it.  My knees are not esp. happy with it, but I have broken one before, and I  am strapped for itme too, but this is  one thing I never skip before work.

THAT Chil would be  a trigger food for me, and  I could see me snacking on the nachos all day too.  I must pass. As for your fingers, this has happened to me !  Now mind you, I do have poor circulation, but it has only happened on the LE hand on cold days . I believe it is when I am wearing a glove where the fingers are too tight.  ( I have many OTC  fingerless gloves ) .  Even one of my Farrows has 1 finger trimmed just a tad more than the other Farrow and that one sometimes gets cold.  I think the culprit was a \" snug glove effect \".  I too considered hand warmers like my mailman son has , but then recalled the warning about microwave warmed bags ( which I used for 10 yrs btw !) being bad for LE.  I decided the premise was similiar and I would not chance it.  My wrist and hand are the biggest issues and the most obvious. I swear I would not mind a sleeve with a gauntlet.  Having to wear a glove is not only very conspicuous, but I know it will suck in the summer. Carol, you know more than I do about LE, but please, dont chance your hand.   I think perhaps the liner just made everything too snug. Go without it next time and do what you ended up doing. Dont put heat on your LE hand. Also- be sure to check my reply post on the gloves and sleeves forum later.",

So , I met with the VP, LIVESTRONG trainer and another lady at the local YMCA today.  I submitted Carol's doc. from the SUSO site ( a million thank yous to Carol et al) and they were very impressed.   They are actually looking into new CURR. and would like to consider using it. I spoke to them about the possibility of an EX video ( still waiting to hear from Rays of Hope) They said I would have to submit an RFP. I could hear ( ESP from the VP) that they would have  very serious concerns.  The trainer ( who I had met with once before) told me for the first time she has a woman with 2 sleeves ( and gauntlets ) in her class.  I really feel we have contrbuted something  already.  I think if this lady came in 2 mos ago and WASNT wearing gauntlets they might not have known....  They feel a HUGE sense of responsibility because as they said, the DRS are sending the BC pts there ' cleared for exercise\".  They are lay people and dont feel it should be their responsibility to  evaluate etc etc ... or even be the ' first point of contact ' regarding LE. They are RIGHT of course.  It should not and IS not, but armed with this info .  Well, now they know. The problem, is, as I said : \"  When I was young, if I saw a  35 yr old man running down the street, I would presume he just stole soemthing!\"  Today, it would be  a jogger/runner.  Exercise is not what it once was.  People, and not just \"Fat people\"  ( OK I said the F word) are doin' it./ If you are in the ' exercise business' you must be  ready to take some responsibilty. Yet, the kind of burden this info places on them is unfair.  They named 2 area hopitals they might want to consult with.  they were the 2 places I went to for  sub par care for LE.  ( What are they to do ?)  They cant believe it ( But they believe it) It's almost as though I have shone  a light on something that was better hidden in the darkness.  They are concerned, open minded, willing to have me as a speaker, and wanting to investigate further.  At the same time- for lack of a better word- I think they are somewhat afraid/burdened. I understand.",

My LEist has been weaning me off the sleeve - claiming I only <ever> needed it for exercise.  I dunno'. Sure was doing LOTS more exercise when I wore the sleeve FT!  Feels like a hassle now to \" suit up\" in compression! Never thought I would think it was convenient to wear the sleeve.  For those who do wear it ONLY for exercise, what constitutes exercise ?  I mean, obviously, if  were to do a  35 min. fast walking video thats a no brainer.  OTOH, I sometimes find myself buzzing around in the morning, walking at a fasdt glip, riushing for work, cleaning in the kitchen etc .. and I feel strange not to be wearing the sleeve. Not symptomatic , just odd/ then concerned of course. I do wear my glove at all times. Btw, THE HAVEN ( UK)  has a  free exercise DVD they will mail if anyone is interested.  (yoga, taichi and qigong)  They sent it to me free of charge. http://www.thehaven.org.uk/how-we-can-help-you/useful-films-haven-home",

Not sure if it was the VIT E or the ' rubbing it on';which concerns me abut MLD...can't imagine when I dare do it again.

      "Content": "Dec 2, 2012 06:09AM - edited Dec 2, 2012 06:10AM by purple32 ohio I have had problems with shinsplints in the past from pounding pavement and other hard surfaces ( ouch !)  Stretches helpa  lot. This question is about sleeves and all of you exercisers who wear them ' only' for exercising.(I was instructed to wear mine/ with gloves all day long) Yesterday, I did the MLD, some leslie sansone and much later (around 7 PM) I decided to do another mile of leslie sansone.  I had the sleeve on app 12 hrs at that point.  Later, the sleeve was uncomfortable- just a little bunching at the elbow after having it on since 7 AM  and eventually I took it off as I do every evening.  Around the wrist ( my problem area) I had a mark that later went away.  I was thinking I should not be doing exercise so late...after being in compression 12 hours. Later, I dozed off without the MLD and when I woke this AM, my wrist looked  about the same as ever - no worse, no better. I am starting to wonder about this sleeve !  How is it you were told ONLY to wear when exercising ? My LE therapist said I am in stage 1 ( though my first therapist said I do not have LE  but could wear a  sleeve and glove while xercising for prevention , my BS said I do have it but certainly not need a sleeve at all  and this current therapist has never laid a finger on me - she said 12 hrs a day for 3 mos. ! )  Are you all who only wear for exercise in stage 0 or sub clinical ? I am wondering if all day compression is ' bothering' this arm.  I'm not trying to get out of wearing the sleeve. I just want to knopw- are there others here who are considered stage 1 and wear it only to exercise ? Is there any chance the compression is actually  bothering my arm more or ? I really dont know what to think any more - everything is too subtle at this point.  I know I have  small pocket of fluid at the bottom of 2 fingers that I believe is directly related to glove use.  I try to  move it with MLD, but wth do I know ? Thank you dor your stories/ thoughts.",

Thanks, Carol. As far as I am concerned it will depend soley on the LE.  I'm not stupid so I will wait and see if I feel it has gotten better/ stable before I try anything. The way I look at it, I had all the other conditions prior to LE and they never stopped me  before.  This therapists remarks are not at all inspirational , and  I find them to be reckless in fact.  Very limiting at best.  A coach once told my son:  \" Basketball is just not your thing .  Go find something else \"  WTF!  He is 27 and still playing - and is damn good at it, if I say so myself.  I know sometimes my posts seem negative, but there is nothing wrong with a little old fashioned ( justified) anger if it is fueled in a positive way! This is my brother:   He's   58 yrs old. http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/wescott.htm He was LITERALLY a  97 lb weakling. People made fun of him.  That got him mad! This is his website   http://timwescott.proboards.com/index.cgi I plan to come back from this ... with the help and hope of you ladies. Thanks for being the inspiration I need - I guess I just wont find it in the medical field.  That's okay ...been there and done that.  I'm a little underwhelmed with them anyway.",

Ok ladies, I (we?) have an opportunity here and would love your help.   I have managed a meeting next week with two area YMCA LIVESTRONG directors.  In case you are not familiar- many YMCAs offer the wonderful service of giving any cancer pt. totally free access to YMCA instructors and gyms for 12 weeks.  It is very generous of them.  You can probably google LIVESTRONG YMCA Cancer program  to see if your local Y participates. Having said that, there has bene some concerns about the YMCA instructors simply  having BC pts exercise \" like the others\" - meaning, lifting weights , using armbands, etc etc etc ... Of course , I have my own ideas , and I will share them- that is my whole purpose in the meeting, but I would love to have some of you guide me with what is MOST important to get across to these trainers.  Resident experts and exercise gurus...there is no chance of liability here so please chime in. I am the one who will have the face time, and would like to think we might ' save' some  BC sisters from getting to where we are . These two directors at the Y were kind enough to listen to my concerns about LE risk ( neither one ever heard of LE! ) and agreed to meet with me so I can explain exactly what I mean. As I said, I can offer up my own ' stuff' but 2 heads are better than one...multiply that by many, and I am hoping that some of these LIVESTRONG programs, who aim only to do good, might just accomplish their mission. Suggestions ?",

It's a tad discouraging because this is the best support/ workshop group I have seen  pretty close to me.  I spoke to the OT as well as the girl ( who has primary LE) there who runs it, about my concern about the resistance bands.  They both presumed I knew nothing about exercise and LE or the weight training trials  etc ... but finally, I got my point across that is was the bands SPECIFICALLY that I took issue with. They pretty much said I was wrong and should ' try it and see'.  ( no thanks) Additionally, they are associated with a DR that is local to me that Binney once  told me about which raised a red flag. Not so sure about him either.  And, if he is SO great about LE tx I dont understand why he has NO le tx program whatsover at his own hospital ! sigh Feel as though I am ' crying into the wilderness'.

First, when I went to pulmo rehab for my lungs/ copd.  I simply ' copied' all they did.  I bought an exercise bike, some  small hand wts ( long before the BC or LE  btw ) etc ... and  continued my own rehab at home, which was successful. Second time was when I broke a shoulder and tore most of the R cuff off the bone.  They all said nothing would work but surgery. After 6 mos of PT I could not move my hand past my nose.  Today it is 100%  ( but has LE in it ).  I got the full range of motion back by doing pilates and yoga daily ( took app 1 yr ) long after the P.T was over.  It would be pretty easy to tear again since it was never surgically repaired, but just goes to show you , you can continue a PT program at home and, if dedicated and compliant- come out on top.

Seemed very easy to me.  Maybe I'll be sore tomorrow. Who knows ? I liked the feeling I was doing something for myself. Several yrs ago I tore my rotator cuff- it was almost complete/ severe. I went to PT Three times a week for 6 mos until my INS said I was done. I also had 2 cortisone shots.  STILL, my hand could not reach past my forehead. (I avoid surgery like the plague !)  In any case,  the therapists there told me they would see me again- after my surgery. Two yrs later I was in therapy ( for  a broken knee) and saw my main therapist. I waved to him from across th room.  Seeing my arm go so high he said \"  Aaaah, you finally had the surgery , huh ?\" When I answered no, he came across the room later to talke to me.  He was amazed when I told him I did yoga and pilates every single day for  a year and I got  every single bit of my ROM back. I was reminded of that by Lebed. It makes me feel like maybe, just maybe , it can help.",

LINDA- You know I am a newbie so pls take this with a grain of salt, but I am musing .  It is meant more as a question than \" advice\" but for now, what about trying the IMAK arthritis gloves on amazon ?  ( Just do a search there.)  They have worked very well for me (SO FAR).  I know they cannot provide the compression needed for LE. I am wondering , however , what would happen if you did MLD and then put your sleeve and an IMAK on for 1/2 hr . to test the waters.  Just a  thought. Perhaps you could get a pair for when you AREN'T wearing the sleeve, to help with your arthritis at least. I wear mine out with a coat as a pair and just pull one off when I am inside . I dont think it could hurt to wear the glove w/out the sleeve. I'm going to miss them once my Rx garments come in!",

About 5 yrs ago I was trotting with my dog in the park.  That wasnt too smart because I really couldnt trot and my dog was a lean, fiercely athletic happy go lucky guy. At one point,  the dog started to go a bit faster and a LARGE tree root, obscured by my sunglasses was there. I went UP UP UP - but landed on my feet. I immediately said: \" Thank you, Jesus !\"  Yep, it blurted right out of my mouth  No thought to being politically correct, sorry- I just felt it, and I said it. Within 2 seconds there was another root, my dog took off and this time I landed on my knee and broke it. Damn COPD!  I wouldnt have been out trying to get healthy if I had already been healthy!!!!! Your post made me chuckle and really reminded me of that. Laugh or cry, my friend.  Your knee is not broken so I say - laugh !",

' fast walk' and plan to do another shortly.  Sleeve and glove of course. I need opnions : I called a Vodder therpost who was not avail. who then gave me to someone else who is not trained in LE , who gave me to yet another person not trained in LE. ( I Have an appt for FRI / maybe) In any case, they all agree I should have had some hands on tx.  The girl I spkke with says she has been a PT for over 25 yrs and has done lymphaic drainage on \"several pts with good results\".  They also do a fitness program there (  NOT esp for cancer or lE  pts) One thing that was  a bit of  a red flag was that I told them I am having some symptoms in my ' good arm'.  They said in the future they might be able to take me thru some treadmill walking, and fitness  etc ...with oximeter and BP readings. I said I will not be having any BP readings becuse I *might* be bi lateral, I just dont know yet. They tried to convince me BP would not be very likely to be an issue.  In the end, I made it exceedingly clear that I will not be having my BP taken  there at all, but I dunno'.... I do not want another bad run . Should I hold out for  a\" real \" LE therapost ( or just go to my own massage girl who is willing to learn and has also had some experience ) Not having a great feeling about these ppl.  I dont want to use up my remaining PT visits on frustration. Whaddaya think ? PS Look who was just out of my reach:  Kathy J. Fleming, PT (Vodder, Foeldi) was pretty nearby.  I looked her up online and she has some great videos. I called the place the net said she was working at and they said she is a teacher of  LE now and hasnt been there in 6 yrs., and they dont know where she is , but believe she no longer does the therapy  :>(",

( I was just on a very long email exchng w/him yesterday where he went waaaaaay out of his way to help me )  I have no doubt you could email him, and ask what the policy would be if the small didnt fit properly. In the meantime, I have a size small allegro ( cheapo) that I only tried on - never wore at all. I bought it because I was ( still) waiting for my sleeve order from the fitter since the day after TGiving, and I am weary of washing the one so it was just as a spare. The wrist area has a light ' band' , and my wrist is my problem area so  I will not wear it. I took it off immediately.  IF you would like to try  it, pls PM me, and I will be happy to mail it to you.  I can also give you Josh's email address. I would also ask how you are laundering and drying your garments .  I imagine that could make a difference. Mine does say to use the dryer, and I do. BTW, does anyone here know of any reason not to take VITAMIN E  with LE?  I am having some  other health isuses I am trying to work on, and I know  there are so many catch 22's with this condition.

All of us ladies could be in the same boat as GMA if our insurance won't cover certain things. We need to speak up for ourselves and advocate for others. This is why for example I would like to see Farrow get 1000 emails saying we want a real return policy from them.  On the NLN website, there is a document askinmg for adequate compression garements .  I just did a cut copy paste and my DR just signed it for my INS CO. Ok, sorry I went into my little rant.  I will be at your pity party GMA. I am sorry you are going through this.

I have written a grant proposal to my area RAYS OF HOPE , secured a videographer (from NYC), sound system in place, etc ... I am still doing lots of R & D and ask all of you ladies to keep your ideas coming by PM if you want to be involved in any way .  Even anecdotal 'stories\" are <most?> important. The DVD will be medically based ( have at least one med. consult  so far) and NOT a copy of anyone elses, in any way. I am looking into Qigong for myself and hoping to find it useful. IF SO, I will be sure to add some components of this practice to the exercise routine since I have found COUNTLESS evidence  that Qigong promotes lymph flow. I am going to classes locally. I would incorporate walking as most of us here do some form of that , as well as stretching which is of particular  importance  because so many BC pts end up with limited ROM after surgery. I'm a bit of an ' expert' in the shoulder area myself after 6 mos of PT several yrs ago for an avulsion fx with torn rotator cuff. I was told I would NEVER get my ROM back, but after all the therapy, I manged to avert surgery by doing yoga and Pilates regularly for app 1 yr.   I have full ROM to this day and can  also touch the floor.  During PT , I could not lift my arm past my nose, and finally, after 6 mos, my forehead. So yes, I have experienced the therapeutic power of exercise ! Additionally, I understand the importance of diaphramatic breathing due to my own breathing issues. I underwent pulmonary rehab 13 yrs ago where I was taught proper abdominal breathing and the importance of lifting weights for ' chest strength\". Naturally, with the current evidence brought forth  by the PAL study, I would want to  incorporate something to do with resistance  into the DVD. I have been in contact with someone from PAL and would use my brother, a weightlifter,  as a resource , as well. Hopefully, this gives all of you some sense of where the project is and where it might be heading. I NEED info from anyone who wants to be involved in order to apply for financial assistance. The Rays of Hope grant, if given , will not pay for travel expenses. Filming will be in Massachusetts. I appreciate your involvement in this rather daunting project which I am committed to seeing through to the finish.  My target date would be spring or summer 2013. Thanks for any assistance, info, contacts or other involvement~  ( P.M)",

Normally, you may wear a cami and be covered with a sheet if you are wondering. In another session, your therapist may ( or may not) decide to you need to be wrapped to determine just how much your swelling might come down. This is highly individual. Once your swelling is at its baseline ( as good as it gets) the therapist will measure to have your fitted for a sleeve and glove or gauntlet. Again, you should have MLD or ASK for it.

Don't think I would get that one with the ' jumprope like \" handles. Again, my LEist suggests gently swinging or 'pumping' the arms in a very natural  walking manner- the same way you might in an ' exercise walk'- not just dangling by the side. I ESPECIALLY like the rebounder because I have very poor circulation and icy cold feet. The pumping of the calf muscle really seems to help with that. My feet have not felt 'as cold' as before  since I began. I like something that I can actually feel working.",

The arm did not seem to swell.  I wore the sleeve app. 6 hrs. AOK. Arm felt good. For anyone interested, btw , the Tai Chi ( Yang 24 forms) starts very much like LeBed opening ( only no bubbles or scarves  :>) but then  goes into ' the form\" which anyone could check out on youtube.  I really do love it. So hope this thing just goes away!  An enigma. EITED TO ADD: I love this  Qigong 7 mins to healing. The beginning reninds me of the \" Tai Chi Breather\" hugz ' invented :>)http://www.youtube.com/user/ExerciseToHeal?v=g-jSBBwr8Ko&feature=pyv&ad=8395499484&kw=qigong",

Counting on you ladies to keep me honest here.  Cant really exercise due to the bad shoulder and rash necomes inflamed ...cant do MLD due to the comoing and going of  the 'rash' and was not going to do Lebeds due to shoulder, but I do find I can do most of the opening with just a twinge here and there. As an update, rash may be due to pre existing thyroid issues. I have  a multinodular goiter and  my TSH levels have always been on the border of normal but edging toward hyper.  Bloodwork revealed it is now hyperthyroid. I have it in my head that MLD was what stimulated my already stressed out thryoid, but I dunno'. In any case, I need a  follow up with endo drs. Beta blockers would be my first tx choice but  no can do  because of my extremely low BP.  Tried them once many yrs ago and they had me salt loading to try to keep the BP up and I still passed out it got so low. We'll see. Rebounding and Lebeds before work making me late----must run!",

That sure sounds great, Becky.  Thanks for sharing.  It really gives ppl. hope.  I do think it is important to stress the compliance, and I totally undertsand that . We cannot put everything on our med. team.  In the end, it is up to us. I agree completely, and am READY to be compliant . ( I'd just like some  ' real tx' first!) The PAL program sounds fabulous . Between my job and everything, I really think I have to stick with a therapist that is very close by.",

My therapist said that ' ripping it off' could cause it to balloon even more !  She said for mild swelling (NOT cutting off circulation sleeve) keep it on as long as possible. THEN< later, take off and elevate, do deep breathing etc ... This was her advice, but I so gree with listening to our own bodies. I would like to take a mix of the professional, what you ladies have foiund works, and what my arm is screaming and feel  a more comfortable level of confidence with what to do. ( which is why I so appreciate all of you!) She was not happy I have not made more of an attempt to do MLD, but was more than patient in showing me how to again, and I even requested another follow up appt.  because I  want to be sure I am doing it RIGHT. ( Next time, I'd like to be the one to demo to her and see what she says ) I asked her opinion on LeBed and she said it was 'ok but she isnt as impressed  as she might be because there is just no proof it works. Her take on PAL?  She loves it , but said I am too early in the game for it, which I do appreciate. My angel fitter who came in on her day off took all suggestions I asked for , and I did let her ' win out' on a  custom glove as well. I must sat, I have had LOTS of compliments on these arthritis IMAK gray fingerless gloves !  ( Mostly from the young crowd)  Ordered from amazon. SO- I am dedicated to doing this MLD/ right or wrong,  and I have but one question for all ... IF you could only do MLD once a day would it be before exercise , after work, after shower, or at days end/ bedtime. What have you found the most effective ? Thanks, Ladies !",

Hmmm....naturally that is why I do mine faithfully !  I told you we all had soemthing in common! I went to Walmart yesterday and 3 other stores. I am normally not on my feet so much. I have been having a LOT of trouble with ICY cold feet.  This is not new to me, but I swear it has worsened since the LE!  NO IDEA WHY. Well, it is a circulaotory issue  so I suppose they are connected. I told a DR 2 yrs ago during a  heat wave and they sent me for an ABI which was norm.  Then I told my PCP last summer and he said \"  I'm not buying it.\"  YEP, true story !  WTH would someone  pretend their feet felt like ice ?!  I dunno'.  Okay, I went off to the GRRr thread again.. Anyway,  I dont know what my BP is  but my HIGH norm was 90-/60 when I was salt loading so....  I am guessing it is pretty low about now. I did not drink a lot of water and my legs were swollen /bad sock lines. So, I am about to take the water more seriously. I did do my MLD twice and slept with my feet on 2 pillows.  It felt like the shopping was more than enough exercise On another note, Kira helped me to get  the email of KATHY FLEMING who replied to me this AM. She WILL see me, but does not take insurance.  I am concerned about the price, esp at this time of year, but really think I should try to see her.  Maybe it will be my Christmas gift to myself . ( my, how things have changed since last yr!!!!) OH, as for the TAI CHI  breather...when I do the Sansone walks, I incorporate them in!  First, I use them as a warm up before I put the DVD in.  Later , at some  points where she is doing lots of repetetive arm movements, I  do one or two of those and then play catch up with her.  I think it is a great exercise warm up. Tai-chi sounds like a wonderful idea - go for it ! MUST RUN.",

Ok, seriously, I am NOT  trying to get out of wearing the sleeve...I really dont mind it that much!  But honestly, is this something I should ignore as I always would have  BEFORE  LE or is it not wise to put a sleeve on an itchy red spot for 12 hrs.?  I just dont know anymore. Here is my question: What would you do ?

Until you can get some RX gloves, you might want to look into IMAK arthritis gloves. They work very well for me as my fitter still has not ordered mine  since the last one fit like a vice !  I have 2 pr of IMAK and handwash them every other day. I believe I got them on amazon. Even IF the isotoners were going to be ok for you, perhaps what little ' oooomph' they had is now gone.  IF they worked at first , you might just need a fresh new pair. The light ' compression' in the OTC gloves does not last long.  I am very pleased with IMAK which I have been wearing a few mos. now.       knock on wood. *edited to correct to IMAK (NOT IMaxx) I cant wait until Lymphedivas comes out with  a glove - possibly this summer. Cindyl So sorry to hear about your troubles at this time of yr.  Seems like  a  watched pot never boils!  Pls let uis know when you have news. As for myself....I feel my BP keeps getting lower ( highly symptomatic here) and just going to the grocery store wears me out so no exercise at all for the past few days.  I'll try to catch up after Christmas !  Think I have bene on my feet waaay too much for the othostatic intolerance. OH, and for anyone who has not seen the Grrrrr thread from 2 days ago pls take a peek as we are trying to get ideas ( PM me ) for a *possible* exercise DVD. ( see that thread for more info).  It's a little iroinic now that I look at the  'lead post\" in this exercise thread  It seems many of us agree that it's time for more options for a DVD for LE ladies and we would like to think we have something <new> to offer. At this point, we believe the setting would be someplace in Massachusetts. Everyone can participate virtually. ( PM me those exercise ideas !) Keep on truckin' ladies !",

In the meantime, I am doing a lot of research work on the exercise DVD and have even gotten a videographer from NYC!    I am personally thinking of trying a rebounder <though I am not in the \"best\" position to take a  fall>  because of all the good reports I have come across from it. I know there is some debate , but for me personally, I would hope that it just might improve my leg circulation as well , so I would like to ask  - Does anyone here personally use a rebounder OR have any add'l info on the use of a rebounder  as part of an exercise program for LE? Also- please PM me over the next few days and let me know if you would like to be a part of this exercise DVD ( filming in Massachusetts) either in person OR virtually. I need to compile a list of names - even your virtual names for now. You can always PM me your best exercise ideas , and I will do the research to (also) see what the ' experts' say.  I would also like to know if there are any exercises that you find FLARE your LE.  Even though we are all different, I think it would be of benefit to know and look into this area as well. Finally, does anybody know of a DR or highly respected medical professional who I might contact for input into this project ? Please feel free to PM me any and all ideas as they pop into your heads! *EDITED TO ADD: I know some of you (Carol? )  do not recommend the use of 'stretchy bands' and I believe I understand how it would be difficult to measure the force of resistance being applied. However, I was surprised to find them included in the exercise section in the book: \" Lymphedma  \"(Burt & White) which is recommended by NLN.  Comments ?",

And now another question for you exercise ladies- ESP those who lift weights: I was thinking of when I broke my shoulder ( left of course ) and how I exercised 7 days a week .  Everything I did was on the right. I lifted 10 lb weights for tricep extensions and bicep curls etc ...  I did aerobics , yadyadyadyda and never missed a beat. Pilates and yoga was what I finally used to avoid surgery and get the shoulder ROM back - almost completely btw. But I digress...What about with LE ( ESP with wts ) -  Do you feel comfortable doing anything and everything with the OPPOSITE body part ? In other words, would you say it is fine for someone to just pick up   a hand wt. and start lifting with their \"good  side\"  or  do aerobics with lots of repetetive arm movements on the 'good side \".  My brother ( a national bodybuilder) says it is fine to begin weightlifting on my right, but I am skeptical.  ( Obviously I woud not begin with my ole 10 pound- I have all increments from when I broke the ' bad arm') Whaddaya' think ?",

There are some DVDs out there that some of us ladies use ( Leslie Sansone, the Lebed Method etc ...) to help with stretching, aerobics and conditioning.  Having said that , you would want to ask your LE therapist if you should be exercising right now.  They * may* tell you to wait until the swelling has gone down more, or perhaps there will be some wrapping involved (?)  Each case is different and you really should consult with your medical team before you begin to exercise.

I KNEW darn well I hadn't dreamt this up, but  I have done SOOOOO much reseaerch on LE and exercise I could not recall where I saw this. No wonder I hadn't boomarked it - it was RIGHT HERE on bc.org! Check this out from the experts: Saskia Thiadens The safest and, in my opinion, best exercise for upper extremity lymphedema is swimming. You don't hurt yourself, and patients will greatly benefit from this. Some of my patients wear an older sleeve in the water. Once the sleeve becomes wet, there is more compression in the garment and this can actually help the swelling as well.",

Although Tamoxifen has been noted to increase the survival rate14, it does have multiple side effects, some serious. The side effect of most concern is the increased risk of endometrial cancer and, for post-menopausal women, the increased risk of osteoporosis and heart disease. Other serious side effects are pulmo-nary emboli (a blood clot in the lung) and phlebitis in the vein, possibly causing lymphedema 11,12,13. People who have a history of blood clots should not take Tamoxifen. Other medications have not yet been studied or documented.\" Whatever.  It is what it is, I guess- if you can take it.  I was just thinking of that first reference that I saw <wherever >that did say it INCR risk of LE...just pondering it for BC pts W/OUT LE.",

We, as LE pts cannot afford such luxuries. My distinct impression was that there was a battle of sorts  and we were in the middle. I was  directed to this website by the DR:http://www.strengthandcourage.net/lymphedema_exercise/lymphedema_exercise.aspx I have to take issue with some of the risk factors listed on that website. I am not obese, didnt have radiation etc ... I would prefer to have seen pts warned that you do NOT have to be obese or have rads to get LE.  Then again, I actually HAVE LE so I do think the motives differ. I also found this to be quite misleading ( e.g. One study demonstrated a risk reduction of over 33%!  \" When in reality, the trials concluded :  \"Conclusion In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.  Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00194363  \"    Let's just say I am very disappointed!",

DVD UPDATE: Hi Ladies I should begin by stating that I am planning to post this on  several LE threads.  I would greatly appreciate replies by P.M. In order to add some  more credibility to the EX.  DVD project, I have been in contact with LOTS of people, incl.  but not limited to toise in the med (research ) field.  I am a tad discouraged ( NOT about the DVD, but for us LE pts ) Prestigious people are suddenly also ' thinking ' about making a  DVD!  I have been directed to links of DVDs for BC patients that have MISinformation!  (made by DRS) This is upsetting to say the least. At first, I thought- FINALLY!  More options for us .  Then, after following a  link I see things like radiation causing LE  ( but I didnt have rads)  obesity ( Skinny all my life and now just ' mid weight)  People who are inactive . ( I was active to my ability level)  People who had lots of nodes removed  ( SNB/ 2 here ) etc etc ...  yadyadyadyda....   You've heard it all before.  I've also seen the use of resistance bands touted, which I believe are contraindicated. SO, I feel the need is greater than ever and perhaps a bit more  'urgent' for lack of a better word. PLEASE PM me with your thoughts and whether or not you can be involved ( filming in MA) because if I cannot get enough Lymphedema Ladies from bc.org, I may have to consider my more local support groups.  I MUCH prefer you ladies, who I have come to know and care about , but I wonder if the geography will stall the project.  One thing I know for sure is that I would like everyone in the DVD to REALLY have LE.     I appreciate your support . PLEASE PM me either way. THX!",

In any case, you said : \"I've come to the conlusion that LE is a crap shoot,\" I guess I would agree, up to a point.  But, if that were entirely true all women who had BC tx could get countless BP checks, glucose checks, immunizations, massages,  rake and vaccuum etc .. and  have the same risk as the next person who did none of that.

Great idea, Linda.  But honestly, if Josh is reading the posts, I am certain he wont PM you again once he sees how you feel. nibbana I know your comments were tongue in cheek , but hoinestly,. I have mentioned (warned) LE to so many pts on this BC forum, and sometimes before I hit the submit button , I do feel bad that maybe I'm scaring them. Still, I do wish someone had 'scared' me.  I recall being told : \" No BP or needles in that arm now\"  That was the extent of it and nobody said why either.  I followed that advice of course. However, I had a few chair massages ( included arms) post LX. I had manicures, I did some zumba with repetetive arm movements a few times , I continued my salt loading which I had been doing for many yrs for my low BP ( Dr ordered) .  I did lift a heavy coffee pot at work twice a day, but I dont know if that would really be enough ... I just think with my impaired circulation all of the above sent me into overload. If I had a little warning pamphlet ( tri-fold if you will     I would have had my assistant lift that pot, I would have polished my own nails,  I would not have done those zumba arm moves,  I would have skipped that massage for sure and I would have cut waaaay back on the salt. Woulda' , shoulda',   coulda'... hard to live with . THAT'S why I want to warn other BC pts. If it scares them, I do feel bad, but I'd feel worse knowing they might be increasing their risk of LE, and I sat back and said nothing at all.  Couldnt live with that.",

I gave them the LE doc I created regarding exercise and LE risks etc ...  it was very helpful to them. I asked  what she might  have started me at when I called and looked into LIVESTRONG many mos ago ( BEFORE my LE dx)  She said treadmill ( ok) and bike ( ok) then, after many weeks, perhaps elliptical  (UGH)  So, if my arms were not building gradually,  one day I could just jump on the elliptical ?  I told her that might prove risky.  I explained why. She listened intently and took notes.  She was very graetful and  seriously concerned about everything I had to say. OK, I know some of my posts come across as negative, but I tell it like it is and I have to say STRICTLY from the PAL ppl I spoke with (only) -  Shame on them for giving up on the YMCA!  There was knowledge they could have shared that would help our BC sisters who do not have LE.  The YMCA was very open to me/ to add'l info. They even asked if I would come and speak  ( we'll see ) They took my document for their personal use and I encouraged to check it all to be factual as it had no bibliography. She explained to me that most of their pts are BC pts and need a DRS note.  I explained to her that most DRS would readily give a note w/out mention of LE risk .  Mine would have . I explained the possibility of risk with resistance bands.  She wrote it down.  She was happy to see where I had written that swimming or water play might be helpful and I pointed out that LAP swimming  might be risky .  She took note.  We talked for  a long time. I  made it clear that my main purpose was  to advocate and just hope that perhaps just one person  might become more aware of their LE risk and  not get it.  She promised we would be keeping in touch and working together to be sure their program was as \"safe and effective as possible.   I gave her lots of leads to check online and she wrote them all down. When our meeting was done, she said : \"You came here for something.  What was it ?  Did we meet your expectations?  Have we done what you needed us to do ?\" I heard someone say ,  \" Yes, you listened .\" It was me. *A special thanks to Carol for her editing.",

Yes hugz a harder surface gives me shin splints too.  I think the ' knee thing' is because I broke my knee about 5 yrs ago. As for the intercostal, my LE'ist uses the whole hand, flat- fingers  spread a bit.  She pushes straight down ( NOT too hard, but more pressure than the light, light MLD) and then , when comingback  up she has the ' twist' you might expect on your regular MLD move. ( Doubt if THAT makes any sense just reading it ! )    Anyhow, she starts on the affected side- 5x ea area and moves to the mid-sternum for me.  I also do it myself ... but not as good as she does   :>) Interesting! Oh btw hugz, I am surrounded by giant snowbanks and  slush and ice. When can I come for a visit ?",

Two were in the arm ( the one that has LE) and I just basically left that arm out of all aerobics .  I did lots of walkiing then too. My broken knee was a challenge.  I really got into the weightlifting then. If you have access to a pool , for go for it - as much as you can .  Other than that, if you lift, you can continue. Do you like Pilates ?  That might be another option.  Good Luck to you ! As for me, I did 45 mins aerobics today.  I was going to begin a weightlifting program, but as I scanned EXERCISE ON DEMAND on tv , I came across this great chakra yoga routine. I started trying it out and did most of it when I realized  the aerobics, immediately followed by the yoga was more than what my arm was used to,  It would have been foolish to start the weights. So, I went ahead and did a few of the ' weightlifting  moves' but with no wt . whatsoever- zippo.  Just getting the arm prepped. I need a good session of MLD later!  ",

I will say this much: WE NEED and must advocate for  risk reduction warnings and booklets prior to our surgeries so we can avoid certain things and THEN, if we get LE, we will still have to live with it ...but not with all the regret, just the grief.  Which is enough !",

I've actually been having some kind of LE honeymoon for about a week and have skipped a lot of MLD with no consequence Carol When you are doing all that walking, do you wear a sleeve? My LE'ist has suggested that I was a person who really should have been told to wear a  sleeve ONLY for EX.  She is advising me to wean off the sleeve ( EXCEPT for exercise ) but wear my glove all the time , since I have a spot there that flares. I am finding it difficult! \"First of all, it makes me nervous, since I am  so used to wearing the sleeve all day.  Still, when I think of it , I was ' prescribed' the daily use by a totally incompetetnt LEist so... Anyway,  going w/out the sleeve also seems to make exercise more inconvenient, as I dont feel like getting dressed/undressed everytime I go to walk ( and dont forget I am at work all day) What's a girl to do ?!",

GOLDIE You are right to want soem hand protection as the compression in the sleeve *can* push fluid downwards, causing it to swell the hand. You might not need a glove , but you certainly need hand protection. You can always check for a sleeve and gauntlet set. ( see lymphedivas.com if you are into style) I implore you not to wear rings on that hand. It's not just a matter of not be able to remove it at some point. I actually feel like my ring, which slowly and very insidiously became tight as the LE was brewing CAUSED  more hand swelling, and my therapist agreed.  LE in the hand can be tricky.  I can no longer wear my wedding ring. It's better to remove it' before'...just in case. Good Luck to you.",

The wrist has a slight line there, but I imagine it might anywhow- just like a tight sleeve of a cotton shirt( ?)

Gaiam TV has a free trial for  10 days. I  highly recommend RODNEY YEE for ' anything yoga\" and IMHO there is none better than Garripoli for qigong or taichi.  I warn you ..these may become addictive so if you want more than 10 days, be aware it is $10 mo after that and may require an add'l device ( explained on the gaiam website)  Due to my knee issues, I am soooo jealous of the simplest poses I cannot do ( like wonderful child pose.) but I modify and 'skip'. REMEMBER..if you have LE, avoid things like ' plank' that puts all the weight on your arm. That's my disclaimer  :>) Hope you enjoy! SEE : gaiamtv.com Laurie ADD-ON:  There are also some great  films  regarding cancer care, BC, alternatives or complementary care and much more. OK, sorry to ramble on, but for  EZ calm RESTORATIVE YOGA, this cannot be beat.  Be ready with 2 throw blankets and a folding chair: http://www.gaiamtv.com/tv/yoga-now-upper-body-vide...  you can access after you REG.  for free trial  Very very relaxing after a  big workout or tough day or ...just plain 'ole life!",

My knee was  80% better, and I started power walking. Not too smart, but this started back in January, and I really thought it was  'ok'.  Anyway, it's bene a step backward. makes me wonder about an injection. As for a bathing suit, I do not have  one esp. for a mastectomy, but I do have  av ery nice blue and Black one pc. that I bought  large so it would not constrict for LE. Dont think I will ever go into a pool again. I wore it for 35 mins. If anyone wants to PM me about it, they can have it...no charge LADIES I'm taking an informal poll if you will..... Have any of you had any issues at all with your BP? (Mine is too low to begin with) I am wondering if my low BP and now I have cut salt for LE) acting WITH compression and exercise has LOWERED my BP. Sounds odd, but there have bene some internet articles..... I had sleeve, glove, cami compression as well as thigh highs! Pls reply. Thanks Laurie",

It also needs to be made longer to give me compression at the top of my thigh. The cost is $614.04. Kelly is the director of Customer Service.

I know this sounds crazy, but  is there any way you can tale some FMLA time off and get some good tx in ? When my husband had stage 4 colon cancer., (he's ok right now) in 2009, my head was spinning.  He worked FT and never skipped a beat, but it really didnt look like he was going to make it. I hated the job I was in and I was taking care of him as much as possible after work. It was a roller coaster and merry go round with the INS CO. the surgeries, the doctors, his lack of energy and looking his mortality squarely in the eye. My job was incredibly unsupportive. I finally went in and quit. Yep, I did  !  (NOT suggesting you do that btw) It was the BEST move I ever made. I am sure some ppl thought I was insane. Here was my stage 4 husband struggling to work and me ' sitting home all day doing nothing\". In reality, I had my own health issues and this time off freed me up to get all the household errands, which we used to share , done by myself at my own pace.  I  investigated all the med resources for him, fought the INS CO. <which was actually time consuming!> and was able to spend quality time with someone I thought I was losing. When the battle ended ( of course the war is never over) I changed careers, which has been a blessing. Looking back, I cannot believe I did that , but an FMLA leave pales in comparison. You might want to consider it. Good Luck to you!",

Binney suggested I contact them ( left voicemail and write email today) and tried to stir the pot about getting these made under the code of a medical garment so perhaps some ins. would cover. $69 cash is pricey! Soooo, please check them out , and if you like what you see, pls consider emailing as well.  I think if they see there are many of us, and the need for diversity is great they may realize that have a profitable item.  Her name is Amanda Kennedy.  please email amanda@sassybax.co with cc to Customerservice@sassybax.com because I am thinking her email* may* have changed.

The amount of phleboliths increases with age and they also appear more often on the left than on the right side of the pelvic region.[2] Phleboliths outside the pelvic region appear in about 2% of the population.[3] Phleboliths can be diagnostic for hemangiomas on ultrasound.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure seems very odd.

Can any of you suggest something ' better' for pain mgmngt ?  I will talk to the DR  soon  as he is having his port done this MON and then will start folfox chemo ( 5 FU , avastin and some other nasty warrior oxiplatin <sp>) He said the morphine is not touching the pain at all.

Nerve pain HURTS. His pain is VERY real. Pls dont get me wrong, but I have seen, with an increase in gabapentin and amitrypitaline(sp) his pain has lessened a lot and he has said so himself..this is straight from the horses mouth. I dont think he has a clue how he ' really' feels because he is at the point where he doesnt go long enough without an oxy to know. I may not have lost him to cancer. I sure as he** dont want to lose him to opioids. That whole situation really sucks. I feel he might have a better QOL off them ( doesnt drive right now because he is on so much and would like to for example) but he is afraid his life would get worrse ( withdrawal, pain...) The thing is, he's not in contol...the pills are. (but I knew what you meant) Thx",

This is the essence .... he was in TERRIBLE pain ( app 1 yr ago) Local onc. dr. thought he had sciatica ( grrr) and refused MRI. Finally went to Boston Drs. who DX immed. It was in his pelvis pressing on nerve to leg and foot. After Folfox chemo, he got a HUGE blood clot the ' the bad leg\" and that made that pain much worse. After a yr. he seems more stable and in less pain generally with less swelling etc , but is accustomed to 3 morphines a day and 12 -14 oxys, plus gabapentin. He sleeps a lot. I am thinking he would have a MUCH better QOL without so many narcs and also wondering if the pain level may have gone down with some oif the issue having improved, but he is also dependent on it. Naturally , he is resistant to trying to wean some and possibly add more gaba ( only takes 2 of those 3x a day) and has asked me not to consult DR. Suggestions ? Many thanks and Blessings to all.",

If you truly find you simply can't get the appt. then BE SURE to mark off your ' start point' and document it all. For example.,  If my  DH measures my wrist and calls it point 0  (and later we go up so many cms. and mark 1 and measure and then 2, 3, then 4, 5 until we get to axilla, I must KNOW that DH calls the wrist x# of cms or mm from my nailbed for example or else every single measurement is thrown.  Understand ? You CAN actually do this yourself.  Just be sure to know precisely where you begin and how you proceed to each point, mark with pen and  know how tight, loose , taut or 'whatever ' you hold the measuring tape...so many variables, but if you are off by a cm. ,later, it will be easy to panic when in fact, you  might simply have measured your wrist \"below rather than above the bone' and thrown everything off.

I know the stepupspeakout site has a great page SHOWING how these things are supposed to fit, btw.(thanks for that )   http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ Josh from Lymphedivas is quite helpful, and I have  his email  -if anyone needs to know just PM me. *edited to delete broken link on tommie copper OTC gloves.

I ordered one for $19.99 (Cant beat the price!) in small , which should fit me.It came through brightlife direct without incident. I tore off my lymphediva to try it on and noticed instantly it was VERY snug - too tight. There was no silicone band at the top and what bothered me the most was a 'thicker' area ( almost like a double cuff) at the wrist. My wrist is the problem area for me, so I immediately had concern.  OTOH , I thought perhaps this  'cuff or band' was just what the dr. ordered. Could not tolerate it for more than 20 mins. When I removed it, the wrist area was quite red and the top of the sleeve had a ' dig mark' in my upper arm. All this to say, I will return it and do not recommend it. Bear in mind, this may just be me OR it is possible a larger size would fit better and be okay, but to sum it up in 2 words, I would say :  'buyer beware' .",

I had a  good experience with a guy named Scott, but ask for whoever you will. 1-877-545-8585 . It is in fact FARROW that is non-refundable. Having said that, you are not looking for  a refund. Farrow's insert states: \" ... we provide ... a 2 month  /replacement guarantee on product workmanship...\"  You are looking for a replacement , not a refund so you should have a case, and in fact, it may well be due to their workmanship in terms of the sizing being so different between colors (Now I'm a little concerned about the S  copper I ordered yesterday!) When trying to return a Farrow, I know one thing for certain  because I actually called them before I accepted my black glove (Farrow 1 979 822 9120) - they do NOT work directly with pts. , but rather with the distributor. So in this case, it is Bright Life . The sooner you call the better. Let's hope Bright Life is a more willing go-between than my fitter ! You see, the very reason I contacted Farrow was to be CERTAIN I could trim the gloves although they are called, and I quote from their own insert : \"Farrow Microfine Half Finger , Trimable Glove\" . They said YES - NO problem to trim, and their own instructions ( #6) says it as well.  STILL, my fitter said that she \"did not like Farrow \"  ( Last I looked she didn't have to wear a glove ) so if I had to return it for any reason, she would not deal with them.  Meanwhile, Farrow made it clear they deal only with the distibutor - in my case the fitter as well. I liked the looks and the feel of the BLK glove enough to take the gamble.  Within a few hrs . my finger swelling was gone.  I only hope the trimming will not impact the glove after it is washed. Farrow said it won't , but I have nobody to return it for me if it does.  We'll see, and I will be sure to report here if it does in fact. Good luck to you with BrightLife. Please let us know. We do need advocates!  *Binney Thanks for that link. I will use that side position.",

I am a tad discouraged ( NOT about the DVD, but for us LE pts ) Prestigious people are suddenly also ' thinking ' about making a DVD! I have been directed to links of DVDs for BC patients that have MISinformation! (made by DRS) This is upsetting to say the least. At first, I thought- FINALLY! More options for us . Then, after following a link I see things like radiation causing LE ( but I didnt have rads) obesity ( Skinny all my life and now just ' mid weight) People who are inactive .

I've also seen the use of resistance bands touted, which I believe are contraindicated. SO, I feel the need is greater than ever and perhaps a bit more 'urgent' for lack of a better word. PLEASE PM me with your thoughts and whether or not you can be involved ( filming in MA) because if I cannot get enough Lymphedema Ladies from bc.org, I may have to consider my more local support groups. I MUCH prefer you ladies, who I have come to know and care about , but I wonder if the geography will stall the project.

Besides , there can be skin reactions or other reasons. I cant imagine why they cannot absorb the cost and perhaps even put into place  a policy stating  :\"  No more than one return per customer\"  or some such thing.   This would put ' flighty ' people or people not measured  by a fitter , in notice.   In any case,  I am quite sure it hurts my pocketbook a lot more than theirs .  Lets face it - these are NOT non profit companies.  I'm holding my ground, and  for ME, the jury is out until I get an answer. Clothing companies take  returns all the time- things that have been worn or worn once aqnd even washed and shrank, things without tags- all items they cannot and do not sell again. You make a good point Linda - perhaps Lymphedivas are not for everyone ( sorry , Josh  :>) which is why we need choices ...for those who cannot wear them",

She promised me that she would talk to ' the owner of the company' and no matter the outcome, call me back. I did appreciate that. She called  me today and said they would not take Dream sleeves or the tie dyes back if I ordered and it did not fit, as they were custom colored. I explained ( once again) that I was aware they were custom colored, but we could have fit or skin issues with them necessitating a return and again, asked for some sort of a grace period. She said it would be  a lo$$ for them. I nicely told her that I appreciated that, but felt that in the interest of good customer service , they might take the hit with a small grace period and hopefully, end up with more sales in the end .  She said the owner said no. I told her it was very disappointing and I for one, would not order under those circumstances. She went one once again to explain ' custom' to me.  At this point, I was starting to think perhaps she thought I was  a bit daft.  In any case, I listened patiently and explained that I had TWO, not one but  2 custom gloves (NOT Juzo) that were ill fitting and returned without question. She said they would take custom gloves back for alteration.  I explained further that these went back for good.  Returned. Period.  She said they would never do that, but I digress. I told her I had wanted to try their tie dye, but I guessed I would have to stick with Lymphedivas. She then went on to say, and I paraphrase as accurately as possible : \"We find that customers who go with Divas may eventually have to come to Juzo when their lymphedema gets worse.\" OK, now I was getting flared . I just said : \"What ??!\" She said : \"Lymphedivas are fashion sleeves ...\" I cut her off. I said : \" I would say your tie dyes and Dream colors are for fashion, but hopefully, also for function!\" She replied \" Of course !\" I said : \" I can assure you I do not order lymphedivas for fashion without function. I have lymphedema!  The last thing in the world I would wear for fashion is a compression sleeve and glove all day!  I was just at Kohls and would have grabbed any number of beautiful tops before thinking of ordering a  sleeve or a glove for fashion alone!  I dont think Lymphedivas would appreciate your implication that their sleeves are not for  function!\" She was defensive then of course and said : \" I really dont know if their sleeves function as well as ours or not.\" I said : \" Then I believe you should not be implying they do not since I will be reporting this conversation.\" (And she most certainly DID imply it as I may be other things, but NOT daft!) So, things did not go well with Juzo. Buy them if you love them, order if you will, but  buyer beware . I was not feeling the love.",

Hope somebody answers your Q on the tingling. I know others have posted about heaviness, achiness or odd sensations, but I am not sure if tingling is different than that . What kind of a glove do you currently wear ?",

I think you should sleeve and glove soon after that .  Avoiding the ' in and out' might make it less of a hassle. Enjoy!",

You will risk LE in your hand.  You need a gauntlet ( or glove IF it is in the hand ) IMHO, that sleeve needs to be returned.  There is no ' breaking in' period.  ALSO= \"  she said it would be really tight but once the fluid goes down it will be a bit more comfortable.\"  This sounds odd to me.  I wonder if wrapping might be more appropriate at this juncture so I  am calling out to the ' resident experts' here who I believe willl answer.

Whenever I see a post where someone mentions a sleeve , I always wonder if they mean sleeve and gauntlet .  I sometimes hate cutting in to ask, but  it is worth it. Just today, I called my local medical supplier and  informed them they will have to get a  glove manufacturer on contract.   Now, in their defense, I went to this co. strictly because  they are 100% covered by my INS.  for DME.  They normally do stockings and other DME ... They were happy to set up an acct. for me, and I am thrilled.  I am their first sleeve. When I spoke to the girl today she mentioned gauntlets and asked me if I thought I would be ordering any with my sleeves ( as if they were optional) .   I explained that I would NOT be ordering any , but ONLY because I wear a  glove.  I then went on to explain that hand protection with the sleeve is mandatory, and she should never ever order one without it unless someone shows her their glove  ( or ...) and says they are all set for now and explains why.  She was so grateful for the info.  She just didn't know .",

I'm sorry Linda 3 - I did NOT realize that. As for 'wrapping your head' around it all, I think that may be one of the toughest things.  I sure hate to muddy the waters as you are trying to do that, but I feel compelled to say that some woman do start out wearing sleeves 7 days a week and after losing weight or doing this, that or the other, there have been  *some* women who, over time, have been able to get  down to wearing them strictly for exercise/exertion.  Just sayin'. DO consider a lymphediva.  I had great fun modeling for them.  I am the one on the ' spring patterns' with black top and peacock sleeve. www.lymphedivas.com Good luck getting all this straightened out.",

It stays right on the front burner where you have to deal with it every single day.  There is NO huge awareness campaign out there and I never heard anybody dare call it a \" lymphedema journey\".  I havent seen a  \" walk for the cure \" for  LE. My Harvard trained DRs didnt even so much as hand me a pamphlet on it before or post surgery.  There ARE things you can do to try to prevent it.  (WHY aren't they telling us ?!) You can damn well DIE from the effects of it and it's ugly pal, cellulitis. I dont know if I have LE because I have had some severe edema recently and a PA in Boston termed it LE and sent me to an LE therapist.  When I went , she said she did not see LE and while I pray she is right, I know she could be wrong.  Time will tell.  For that period of time that I was convinced the swelling was LE and my rings wouldnt fit anymore , and I posted on LE threads for answers , I saw just how devastating a condition this is.  It's permanent.  Theres no hope of it going away ...as there truly is of cancer. This is a LIFETIME RISK to all of us ladies, and while I am not trying to scare anybody , I ask you - PLEASE inform yourselves.",

When determining size, always base your decision on the circumference of the affected limb.\" While I LOVE the idea of 2 matching sleeves , has anybody < w/ uni LE> done this?  Seems a little odd.

Make sure you have  a good LEist, great care, daily MLD,  and that you are properly exerising.  Some yoga poses ( ESP. any pose where you  \"carry \" your body weight) are not \" lymphedema friendly\".  Personally, I could not do dopwnward dog now, but could prior to LE. Other poses whould be fine. Just recently our own Carol57 collaborated with a few others and put together a fantastic and comprehensive document on the SUSO website ( site created by  LE pt. advocates right here on the LE forum!) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20doc%20for%20SUSO-040113.pdf Please check out the EX DOC at the above link, as well as the SUSO site, in general http://www.stepup-speakout.org/and most of all- pop in on our LE Exercise thread.  There are ladies there who practice yoga who will probably be able to guide you and support you.  From there , it's trial and error as our issues are highly individualized.

LE is a *lifetime* risk, but I have read it is more common in the first yr or 2 post surgery ( not sure)  A lady from the BC forum PM' d me the other day.  After 20 yrs she now has it - from an airplane flight.(moral of the story? Wear a compression sleeve during flights) Good questions!  NEVER get a BP taken in the affected arm.....despite what any med official tells you.  It's YOUR arm. Same goes for pin pricks, glucose tests, bloodwork- this is a  NEVER thing! Keep arms and hands  extra clean.  Use electric razor and do not geta  CUT!  IF you get a  cut anywhere oimn the affected side , wash, put antibiotic ointment on it and iof needed , see a dr.  Keep a GOOD EYE on that area.  If it turmns hot, rashy or otherwises seems strange, call DR at once ... ( watch out for cellulitis) DO NOT get a massage. DO NOT go in to a hot tub. Consider being fitted for a special sleeve before airplane travel or repetive movments ( like raking)  or lifting weights. Watch for and report any unusual swelling on the affected side. Those are some of the pro active things you can do to help yourself. DRS SHOULD TELL US ALL THIS! Take 20 mins. out of your day and visit the LE theread on this forum  ( Its not contagious  :>)  You will get some of the very best and most accurate info there . Good Luck to ALL of us !

IF SO, call the surgical center and ask for a re-take.  These ppl. are highly skilled and some have  volumetric machines that measure  things before we can even see them.  An ordinary tape measure from a layperson may not catch it while it is still sub-clinical. It's great your lymph nodes came back normal, but unfortunately this is not a predictor of who gets LE. Good Luck.",

NO underwire yet has support.  ( If breasts are small- medium anyway) Doesnt roll ( if you get a  size large enough)  Go one size up. I just love them.  VERY comfortable.

IF your LE is so very well controlled, I might be afraid to try something that could potentially push the fluid down. I hate to say this (YIKES) but in your case doxie  , I would rather \" go sleeveless\" than take that chance! I have never had any issues with the torso trimmer in my OP.

You are awake , alert...totally fine.  I had a  great U.S tech there who was talking to me and telling jokes the whole time which helped  a lot. If you can have  a tooth filled with novocaine, this is quicker and less traumatic IMO.  Really, it was painless, just the *thought* of everything was scary. Wishing you best possible results, but dont sweat the actual biopsy.  It was fine. I should add- I was told I would have  a mammo right after ,..,, (UGH!)  BUT to my surprise, that was FINE!  It was a very very very abrreviated ' light' mammo- nothing at all to speak of.  I took the day off work , thinking I would have issues. Due to driving and tyoing, I might have gotten sore, but I honestly think I would have been okay.  Still, if you possibly can, I suggest going home ONLY because I was able to keep an icepk on for  avery long time which helps tremendously with bruising and I am suspectible to that . I have  a tiny mark where it was done .....absolutely no scar and trust me ladies, this procedure was nothing to be afraid of. Good luck to all!",

I think it is a perfectly reasonable request. I just got my copper, and it actually seems smaller than the BLK ( odd) I am going to wait and try it on in the AM and see. In the meantime, Brightlife did not indicate that I paid ( I Did by CR CARD) and this looks more like a bill. I am going to  call them and ask for a PAID IN FULL to be sent to me.

(Valeria and Nancy respectively) I wore the copper glove for about a half hr to get a better feel and squeezed the fist open and closed etc .. and could see it was not a  good fit compared to the black.  At first, I thought I might keep it, but I realized that might put my hand at risk, limit my gloves and would be advocationg for nobody for the future. It just didn't sit well with me. Knowing how dassi made out with her return policy, I realize it was good but not good enough .  e.g . : dassi said \". She will send me a new glove in sand (what I have right now), charge me but as soon as she receives the returned black one, the money will be credited back to my account.\" I dont have  a spare $86 after Christmas.  ( Dassi's money tree is bigger than mine )  so I played the ' what to do\" game in my head a few times, and then I picked up the phone to call Nancy at Brightlife.  She  went on to call Valeria and call me back. She said that  BECAUSE OF us ladies here on bc.org,  they are aware we have been 'talking about this \" so Valeria (Farrow)  agreed that Nancy could send me a glove out ( NO FEES) and I could just mail the copper one back.  Much as I would love to have tried the beige , I didnt dare , knowing full well the size S  BLK fit, so I went with that one to be safe. Nancy also said that *because*  we ladies are all talking about this and advocating for change , she and Valeria have agreed that something must be done about uniform sizing OR at least some sort of warning about the size difference or else  a more liberal exchng . policy in the future.  I told her I was sure that the ladies on this forum would really appreciate hearing that , and  I promised I would be  certain to post here today to say how very helpful they both were. I just got an email saying my new BLK glove is on the way!  The copper one is here and ready to go out in the morning. So be it !",

I now wonder if she was just getting overtime.  You see, I later found out she had essentially' sat on' my order for  app. 6 weeks.  When I contacted someone they told me she had never faxed the order at all!  It wasnt that it slipped her mind.  I had been calling her and she lied to me and told me that is WAS faxed and that she had tried calling me three times . nada nada. Pants on fire ! Just not true.  I checked all my call logs, asked her what number she was trying etc etc ... like a  fool I belived her until I saw with my own eyes she had not called once.   I have no clue what her game was , but I  will never go to her again. Thankfully, I was able to return those items.  Maybe I should have realized about her when my (former) \" Fake LE'ist\" as I have dubbed her said she was a member of her team and was \" the greatest\" (am I on the grrrr thread ?!) If need be, I would ask my LE'ist to measure in the future. ============================================ *EDIT:  Btw, I happened across this little abstract, and I know it is not saying : \" Dont  wear a sleeve\" , but it does imply (to me ) that perhaps they are not so effective !   I am wondering ... has anyone gone days or weeks without compression and if so, with what results ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17018707",

They felt just a tad more snug than the regular ( not active) IMAKs . I dont know if it is the way they are made with the mesh or what, but I liked the snug feel.  I  dont think I would ever  wear them instead of the Farrow or other RX, on any kind of a regular basis,  but I will say this about them : For $20 I think they are great temp gloves. http://www.amazon.com/Imak-Active-Arthitis-Gloves-Small/dp/B007JVIG1S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361632969&sr=8-1&keywords=imak+active+glove",

I have not had LE long enough (IMO) to have an INCR in the right side as far as the  ' good hand' taking over, and I dont do many  difficult, heavy  / challenging activities ( desk job) that I believe would cause that so go figure ...but I hear you . My LEist did say to try to be as ambidextrous as possible , and I do.  If I carry a grocery bag, I don't make the 'good' hand take the whole load for example.  I'll use 2 hands. I duno'.",

I am sporting the MJ look, but listen, IF the swelling came ONLY because of wearing the sleeve and was sudden, there is  a chance that working on that area with your LPT and doing MLD at home, and all the things Binney advised could result in you getting into a gauntlet rather than a glove IF the swelling subsides and is stable for some time- you'll have to ask your LPT at some point. All I'm saying is- dont give up.  The glove may not end up being a  ' forever thing' in your case.  A gauntlet could be a possibility. No matter what though, you MUST wear some sort of hand protection with a sleeve. Best wishes!",

I have  been taking the sleeve off after work, but I am finding it very inconvenient to exercise on the spur of the moment and I end up  doing lots less, which is no good either. GRRRRR! ooopps- wrong thread DIZZY Welcome to the  Catch 22 world of LE!  As for the aquaphor, its a very good product, but be careful.  Your post implies you put it on and then put the sleeve on (right away ?)  I would not do that .  I know I know...it all gets ridiculous. I put  a LOT of my creams on overnight and anything else goes on right after the shower , and I wait as long as possible, in bathrobe to then put the sleeve on.  Dont like the idea of something greasy followed immediately by compression.  I am too paranoid about moist environments or even possible cellulitis - and everything else when it  comes  to LE!  Perhaps others will chime in and say I am being silly. I just dont know anymore.",

That make sense, dassi- yes, but I do hope someone else has add'l suggestions. Also, it may sound like a no brainer, but can you put all your vegs into a colander strainer and let water run over them while you walk away and do something else.  ( like give your husband a pinch, perhaps  :>)",

As many of you know, I was measured with perometer at MGH , pre-op but was never ever told  what it was for. They are doing a  study and just asked if I would mind putting my arm in for them. I literally believed it had nothing  to do with BC - let alone LE. By the time I had re-measured, I already suspected breast LE , thanks to info on this forum. I wish I had looked sooner and saw the tips for my arm/hand. Instead, MGH kept telling me my breast swelling was normal so my head was comfortably buried in the sand for awhile- each time I called them.... as my LE ' travelled ' if you will. To me, there is NOTHING more important than  risk reduction. I know I will always  be looking over my shoulder and wondering if I could have prevented this. With just a 2 min conversation and a trifold brochure of reduction tips, I would be  able to say I did everything I could ...can't say that.  Never got either. This is why I take every opportunity to give peope risk reduction tips and direct them to the wonderful www.stepup-speakout.org site. Boatingirl We are soooooo familiar with the roadblocks associated with LE. Very sorry you are going through this.  I believe you may have to be measured by someone else. In any case, if I were you ( and know what I do now )  I would call PCP and ask if he would \"write these measurements in my med records for me\" and I would INSIST they document them at your hospital just prior to surgery. They could always add the note: Taken by spouse \" or whomever , but I would definitely ask they put them in your record. Good Luck to you.",

There are many things you can do for risk reduction and begin by having a  talk with your surgeon about your concerns .  The appt with the LE therapist is a great idea. Also, get measurements of areas of your arms pre and post surgically and keep tabs on them .  Your therapist can assist you. As for the stretching, I would not do any post op stretching of the axilla too soon.  There has been some  controversy in this area. I might wait  several weeks and then take it slow and ez.  Others here are extraordinarily well informed , and I have no doubt they will weigh in with solid advice, but in the meantime, I wanted to touch base. They have created a great website : www.stepup-speakout.org where  almost all your  questions will be answered. Bookmark it ! The following risk reductions are pretty standard in the meantime: NO bp or needle sticks on the affected side...ever!   Dont wear tight jewelry/watches or rings. Consider a compression sleeve and hand protection when flying. Stay well hydrated w/ water. Do slow low impact exercise withoiut repetive arm movement when ready Build up the exercise very gradually, over time. Avoid large quanities of salt Keep your BMI in check After your surgery., be caureful about full foroce heavy lifting or repetetive arm movements Do not engage in deep tissue massage Be careful of sunburn Be keenly aware of the affected arm, and \" baby it' for awhile- esp in terms of lifting heavy bags, vaccumming  etc ... Those are the basics- good luck to you !",

I MIGHT not have ordered the copper had I know.  Hopefully, it will be okay.If not, I don't expect an issue- period. I have enough to deal with , with a fitter who appears to be an angel and was most likely getting double time coming out after the holiday and then sat on my order for 4 weeks!  Now I have to order thru Brightlife who my INS CO did not accept. Pls refer to my other replies to your posts for a better understanding. Also, my fitter told me I could take a custom glove home and try it for 10 days, wash and wear and retrun with NO questions asked , and she claimed I could do this with most gloves. She said that once I signed off on the Farrow it was mine...even if I didnt trim it. To me, that is NOT a good policy.  I am going by what the fitter  said.

Just be sure to chk off UPS and NOT USPS for free S&H. Thanks, Dassi! I am providing a link to the gloves in case others want to look:    http://www.icondisposableglovesplus.com/inspcotton.html (*pls correct me if this is not the right pg)",

I question wheteher or not I need to wera a sleeve and glove ( buit for exercise ) because I was told to do so by an inept PT,. I saw my LEist tonight and she measured and did a complete exam. She said my \"good arm' is bigger than the left/ affected arm. She is aware it is the dominant arm, but I have no LE signs at all in my left arm. (Breast and hand areas .) My affected hand is 3% different.  ***EDITED to add- actually , I believe she said only 3 mm different! She said she would suggest I always wear both for exercise, but perhaps to start backing off the sleeve a bit <take it off after work to start>and she will follow me with measurements. I trust her, but I dunno'. I go @ 2weeks for MLD . In any case, I need the glove , which is the part that actually bugs me- though I love the Farrow. What do you ladies think ? I have been wearing for app 4 mos now, but as I said - it is quite possible that I never needed to wear a sleeve ( except for exercise ) Is there anyone who just has hand LE and wears a glove ( and sleeve only for exercise )? Thanks for any input.",

I am certain you can find it at www.brighlifedirect.com under Farrow glove in the searchbox. Having said that, a few of us LOVE our OTC IMAK ACTIVE gloves!  While I would *strongly caution you that these are NOT medically correct.  I am just thinking  for $20 you might just want to try a pair to have as a spare and to check out.  You could show them to your LEist.  I know some who are beyond mild LE are also compression sensitive so you never know- perhaps one of these would actually help.  Of course, you and your LEist would know best. I am learning though that all of this is trial and error- which is scary!  At the moment, I am wearing my IMAK ACTIVE instead of the Farrow Rx ,most days! IF you decide to try the IMAK , look at www.amazon.com and search IMAK ACTIVE arthritis glove.  It seems to be preferred ( by me and a few others ) over the ' regular' which does not list as ACTIVE. Good Luck! *buyer beware",

You may deduct only the amount by which your total medical care expenses for the year exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. For years beginning after December 31, 2012, you may deduct only the amount by which your total medical expenses exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. You figure the amount you are allowed to deduct on Form 1040, Schedule A. However, individuals age 65 and older (and their spouses) are temporarily exempt from the increase. This exemption for seniors applies to any tax year beginning after December 31, 2012 and ending before January 1, 2017 if the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s spouse attained age 65 for the tax year.",

This may not be good ' official' advice so think it over, but you might want to consider stretching the sleeve ( a little) over  a jar of spaghetti sauce or something like that .  You may run the risk of loosening it too much, so do be careful. You do wear a  gauntlet when not wearing a  glove , right ? You do need some hand protection  whenever you are wearing a  sleeve. Good Luck. Hugz YAY!

I only had 2 nodes removed and NO RADS so anyone can get LE, so you are very wise to take this precaution.  Hopefully, it is some thing you will never develop , but I will tell you personally that knowing what I do now, I would want a sleeve and hand protection if I had 15 nodes out and was planning a flight. IMHO, I really think it is prudent.  Not all med. prof. may agree. That doesn't necessarily mean they are correct!  Many of us have had to advocate for ourselves (and others!) when it comes to LE.  It is your body, and it is wise to take precautions .

IMHO, the Farrow policy is still not what it should be .  ( I would like to be able to return an unused glove within x # of days and once they have it in their hands and see it is unused, then exchange it for the proper size or color/ no add'l monies asked for .) Btw, Valeria from Farrow did email me back. She is very nice and explained that she agrees but does not set the policy ( of course). Naturally, I would be much more concerned with proper fit over color, but OTOH if places are going to offer their gloves in color in order to attract more consumers then I think they must give that some consideration as well. I hope someone can help you on that brand name, dassi.  This has become an interesting thread.  I would really love to see ppl. be able to use it to swap off (righ/left) gloves that they have had to buy in pairs as well.",

As for : \"This is a little problematic because there are patients that purposely damage products near the end of the warranty period so that they can get a free new garment\" I truly understand this , but my issue was that there policy was not uniform across the board. For example, the day my fitter  had me try one glove and also a Farrow she  specifically said : \"With this glove <non farrow>  you can wash and wear for 10 days and return with no questions asked.\"  Once you sign off on the Farrow, it belongs to you - period.  ( Now I must add, in all fairness to Farrow that she was totally unreasonable in not wanting to get involved  if I trimmed the 'trimmable glove' -  DOH!) Still, I would like to think that Farrow might be able to offer something like a 7 day grace period   OR even that  they take the glove back as they are doing with mine rather than what they did with Dassi ( chng more $ up front) All of this to say, there ARE better solutions, and the good news is that I believe Farrow is striving to work with us to recognize our needs as well as their challenges. I thank you so much for your contribution to this conversation! And again, I should add that Nancy from Brightlife was very helpful in all of this as well. Many thanks to all - we love the Farrow product !",

All they deal in is SIGVARIS. The sleeve had a  gauntlet attached ( I wear a glove)  but I thought I should try it on since it was ordered.  TERRIBLE size!  It was too short, bunchy loose and the material with ' thick\". I apologized for  OK'ing their order, but showed them how poorly the sleeve fit and the two ladies there said NO PROB- you are our first sleeve. They could see it was all wrong. I had the sleeve on a little more than 30 seconds I would  say. I went to take it off and  my arm was angry red blotchy and lit up like crazy in the elbow crease.  Kind of scary. The nurse there got  a wet towel so I could wash my arm and I aslo asked to use her Gold Bond lotion .  I hung out there awhile until the red blotchiness finally faded, and in the interim I threw a good pitch for the LympheDIVA which they could see looked great and was  nice and soft , etc .. they said they are going to email Josh  (YAY!) Anyhow, put my sleeve on before I left, but when I went back to work, I decided to remove it since that was such a harsh reaction and I didnt know if it would be wise to ' compress it' so soon.  That was 3 hrs ago.  Do you think I should put my Lymphediva back on ( I feel naked !)  or leave it off for the night ?

I do like the thought of wearing 2 that match in summer.  I would heed Binney's advice as the wrist/hand is my problem area so I  would want to make sure they werent tight at all for me. May I ask- under what search phrase did you find them on ebay ?",

The mirror pic is blurry : http://www.lymphedivas.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=3621&idcategory= hugz I *think* I know what you mean.  OK, I believe you would like this.  When I walked into my LEist home with this she took a double take and chuckled.  Then she said : \" For a splt second, I thought you got tatts, but that is way cool! \"  Really, I think it looks like a tight  long sleeve T shirt with screen printed tattoos.  JMO though.  I am wearing it in the mirror pic with my brown crafters OTC dritz, and I aslo wear it with the BLK  farrow glove when I feel I need more compression. It would look great with a black T or a beige T.  Of course, function first, but as Victoria would day : \" Girls just wanna' have fun!\"   That's the great thing about Lymphediva...they are fully functional RX sleeves.  (note added for any newbie or future newbies to come) Hugz I am not exactly sure what I asked about your tie dye, (length ?) but I have a call in to JUZO about their return policy on tie dye as well as all Dream Color sleeves return policy.  I am asking for some sort of a grace period for full refund or else exchange - perhaps just 7 days.  ( NOT just for me/ for all of us ) They will let me know next week, and I will post here. I will not order the tie dye unlss I know I can exchange it if I must. I just don't think it's fair to us .  As I explained to them - it's not as though it's  a sweater that I can pass onto a friend or cousin, AND *if* my ins . pays then my health may suffer because it is 1 out of my quota.  If I pay, I suffer .... I DO have  a fitter, but I have seen mistakes made  ( on 2 custom gloves I was glad I could return) I also have had a  severe skin reaction to a sleeve- a SIGVARIS and was glad I didnt  get stuck with that one. The lady I spoke  with was very understanding, but of course, she does not make policy. We'll see!",

It was a fabulous day and the Diva HQ's  is an amazing space. The ppl. are so warm, and Josh is just as you might imagine- and such a gentleman .  I also met his dad, the DR. and many of the staff.The place is so impressive. And I have to say, although I was doing a  shoot for  LE products, my mind was on LE less than it has been in a  long time.  Sometimes just some fum and excitement is the best therapy! Wait until you all see the  beautiful sleeves Diva has  coming out, and they are hard at work on 'perfecting' the glove.  Don't forget, they have ' length' choices now , if you had trouble with fitting before-  now comes in short...

I am just telling you that sometimes, you can  push with your INS CO and get results. Bright Life is very good to work with- just a tidbit. EDITED to add;  Having said all this, I am keenly aware that we all dont have such ' good ins'.  This is why I feel  it is vital for all of us collectively to visit www.lymphedematreatmentact.org",

I agree completely, and admit that it's been  a struggle for me. I have to say though, I am still nowhere near the point that I care to educate the kind of person who has an exhange that the teller  had with Denise. I have 100 leaflets from the LE TX ACT that I plan to distribute in Boston.  I feel that is much more educational. I just honestly believe , with all my heart that a person ( such as the teller) is not needing or seeking an education- they are being  a jerk, and invite any kind of a response they may get...the kind of a response they really wont forget!  Perhaps I am caught in the angry stage ? ( I dunno')  In any case, I feel the anger is justified when someone is a jerk. Do we have to react with anger ?  Not always, but sometimes, to deny our feelings is to deny ourselves. We're all different, and it can be looked at in different ways. There is nobody I respect more than you when it comes to the topic of LE , but I refuse to attempt to 'edify' someone at the expense of my dignity, and that's just how it/I would feel. ",

My trunk LE was actually better than it has been for at least a year and a half.

Hey, I say whatever you did- keep doing it! This strongly encourages me because I have  a little vaca planned just 3 weeks away, and I was actually thinking I might cancel due to my LE and some other pesky issues.  If you can go through that type of experience/water and come out unscathed, I think I can take my chances.

When I was looking into the LIVESTRONG program at my YMCA I suspected at that time that I might have breast truncal LE and knew very little ( even less than I do now  :>)  about LE.  I was afarid to go there because although they worked with cancer pts ., When I called, I asked if they worked  specifically with ppl. with LE and they said no.  I actually think it is irresponsible of them to promote their free exercise programs to women who have had BC surgeries and treat them as if they are at no risk for LE ( when in fact they may be creating a risk!)  All this to say, I would also love to see this in the hands of all YMCAs. The top of my list would be : \" Don't ask BC/ LE pts. to do moves with repetetive arm movements as it may pose a health risk or induce swelling\" \"Don't expect BC/LE pts  to participate in weightlifting without clearance from a DR or LE therapist. \" \"DO encourage women who have had BC to consult their medical team and see it is is advisable to wear a compression sleeve/ glove during exercise.\" DO look into safe weight lifting programs for women who have or are at risk for LE - be sure to consult physicians and LE therapists before proceeding. DO encourage  women who are exercising to take several water breaks. DO ask women who may have arm fatigue to stop their exercise  rather than to subscribe to the  'no pain/ no gain' theory. That's it for now - hope it helps some. Thanks for doing this !",

So far, I am loving the brown  - if you care about colors and the jersey like material is nice and soft. In reality, they are exactly the same material as Imak 92% cotton/ 8% spandex. They seem just a tad smaller than the gray IMAK, but then again these are brand new, and I am putting them on in afternoon. Prerhaps my hand has swelled some. I love the  feel of the light compression. Wish I could wear them  right side out, but the seams would dig , so not happening. I intend to intentionally stretch the thumb a little. I wore them 15 mins ., just took them off for a sec. and fingers look good ( knock on wood) So far, I like these for ppl. who are okay with light compression OTC and would like a brown glove.",

Great point KS1! Josh, Pls keep this in mind!  Even with my gloves inside out, seams can be harsh with daily wear. I'd love  a beige and black T with a good short sleeve that does not cover the top of my compression sleeve , but is longer than cap which could be irritating.  I would love rounded or V neck.  Ideally, I would like something I could wear as a ' stand alone ' with my sleeve OR under something else, where nobody could see it at all. Now, work the magic! thx for always listening.",

Dont care for the way they advertise ' lymphedema prevention', but whatever. Pick your battles, I guess. thx",

Hi Carol, I have a blk onyx sleeve (and paisley  ) with the DB and I have another blk onyx without.  I was not happy to discover that my fitter  ordered it without the DB, but I kept it as is. Here is my experience: I would not exercise without the DB because that sleeve  will inch its way down with activity.  What's to hold it up ? Having said that, I AM having a problem with a 'rolling' of my DB under the axilla .  I emauiled Josh about it just a few weeks back, and  although I am tall with long arms, I wondered if perhaps I should have ordered a short.  (I dont know about you, but my sleeve/DB will go waaaay up the underarm)  After giving a few measurements to Josh, he thought I might have been better off with the short.  It makese sense to me because then, if I pulled it waaaaay up it would not have the axilla area in a sense pushing it down.  ( Is thatwhat the cause of yours is/what do you think ?) I will be interested in your respoinse because I have  a local company covered by my INS looking into Divas and I planned to order the short next time. I can really say with confidence that I do not think you'd be comnfortable  with your level of activity and no band at all.  I feel certain it would move downward- though would not create any tourniquet effect. Let me know if you think having a shorter sleeve would make sense or not.  I know Josh reads these threads. ------- As for the farrows, thank you!  I am having an issue with mine now.  I plan to discuss it with my LE'ist.  She looks for ' valleys and hills' on the backs/palms of the hands.  This has trained me to do the same.  My Farrow,  on the palm, is not a bit snug.  I have ' hills' there now. I wonder if the glove itself is actually causing these hills (pockets of fluid?)  by being snug and effective in the other areas of the palms ( the valleys )  Very hard to describe, but my farrow did seem too good to be true.  Perhaps I will need an insert of some kind.  If that becomes the case and I find my Farrow is not as  'perfect' as I originally thought, I might just shop around some more.  I dont want a glove that CREATES areas I have to essentially fill in.  I wonder if others find their  Farrows have  a loose  spot so to speak on the palm. Aaaah, you would think custom fit would be the answer, but not with my fitter. Nope.  Those suckers were vices !  Perhaps I will ask my LEist to measure and advise . I dunno'.  I so love the looks and light weight of the farrow. Cant we have it all?!",

Good thinking! I went w/out a  sleeve for severla weeks while my fitter sat on my order. I kept calling her and getting VM.  She told me she tried me 3x.  My call logs told a different story , which was a BIG turnoff.  Finally, she said my sleeves were ordered.  I contacted the complany who said they were not. The company was kind enough to call her and ask her to fax the order to them. For that reason ALONE  , I will never use this fitter again. Not to mention the 2 failed custonm gloves. You must have  a good rapport with your team. From now on, I will nicely ask the fitter WHEN they plan to submit my order.  I will give them THREE extra days and then call and ask if they had a  chance to submit yet.  After that , I will follow up with the company.  It's such a shame when we are (mis)treated this way.",

Until you can get one, Binney had suggested I order an OTC ISOTONER (amazon.com) I also use an OTC IMAK ACTIVE(not the IMAK regular) from amazon.com .  I find the IMAK ACTIVE is *almost* as good as my RX and would suggest it if mine was in the laundry or as a temp like you may need right now. Many of us use a FARROW glove (RX)  and if all you need is light compression , you may be a candidate. However, there are ' sturdier' gloves for folks who need more. Right now, my Farrow works great, but if I were to fly for example, I just might want something more substantial. My fitter had custom ordered 2 gloves for me that were horrible and cut my CIRC. off. I returned one and refused the other. If you cannot open and close your fist with a glove, dont be afraid to send it back. Also- we wear the seams inside out ( say on the IMAK ACTIVE) since  it would  be  very rough on your hands not to, and the last thing you wnat to do is crack your skin. Use lots of lotion before bed/overnight.  (Something like a Eucerin, something gentle) I found the (RX) black farrow on www.brightlifedirect.com if you want to do a search.  Beware because these are very hard to return . You could call toll free and spek to  a rep there. They are helpful. Hope this helps a bit.",

The blk one looks nice.,  The feel is silky and very very thin.  It keeps my hand under excellent control.  It is $86 at www.brightlifedirect.com  and my INS covers 80%.  I really think you will find the 'least cumbersome' of all gloves.

Brightlife is excellent when it comes to returns. Check with your INS CO first. Initially, mine said they would not pay for Brightlife ( They normally will pay80% if it is not their preferred vendor) and  I wanted my farrow from them.  Later, I convinvced a supervsior at the INS CO they were no different than me ordering from one of their  DME cataolgue suppliers.  She asked for a tax ID , and I called the Brighlife toll free number and got one. When I sent my bill in they said no because it was ordered online, which was not true ( I called) This last time , I asked Brightlife  to type ordered via phone on the invoice and they did.  Prior to that I spoke to a supervisor at INS and told them I would be ordering from Brightlife , a DME distributor, by phone, through their ( virtual) catalogue. I got the OK and they now cover Brightlife at 80%. Sometime we have to be creative. I agree  that brightlife is great to work with.",

I dunno'  LOTS of women type for work and dont get LE.  Who knows ?",

I'd like to give KUDOS to Josh Levin of www.lymphedivas.com for all the legwork in setting up our meeting of a small coalition  with Congressman Neal  who is now on board.  We met on OCT 17  2014  It was Josh' persistence that really paid off. Thanks to Josh, Congressman Neal and all of our coalition members. Now, all of you, please visit the site and help! http://lymphedematreatmentact.org/ THX Laurie",

      "Content": "purple32 wrote: Hi all I had some baseline labs done for kidney function etc .. last FRI because I am having the breast MRI this FRI. I have always wondered about my  right \" good\" arm as it sometimes aches etc ...since the LX and LE in the left, but I  am told it is probably overuse  etc... though I dont really buy it. I just dont feel like I overuse it. Naturally, I am concerned since it is my dominant arm, but I see it as highly unlikely ( but we never say never with LE) in any case, when I went for the lab work, I asked the girl to clean the area well with 2 wipes insread of one ( this annoyed her ) and to use  a butterfly needle , which is always standard with me anyhow. All seemed to go well. In the past, I might keep the cotton and tape on right til the next morning when I showered.  Instead, I removed ti within the half hr.  Hardly enough time to cause an issue. Where the tape was  it was  very red which is unusual for me (in the past) Since my LE, I occassionally get ' red areas' ( but usually on the LE/ left side)  I use calming cream <eucerin> and it fades away. Anyhow, I finally cleaned this area again and used the cream where the tape was and it got lighter overnight. Looked pretty good today.  Just took a ( warmer than I should have ) shower and it is \" highlighted \" again. This is really odd to me and concerning since I'll be getting an IV on Friday. Does anyone have any insights into this ? Yes, I know it sounds like an allergic reaction to the tape, but I have never ever had any issues like this with labwork prior to LE, not I have I had occassional ' mystery areas' turning red. I am not thinking cellulitis- they respond to Eucerin, and I have no other symptoms. I am starting to get very concerned about this MRI with GAD  IV. Lymphedema on LEFT.
