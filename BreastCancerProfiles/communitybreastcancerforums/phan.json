The pain was minimal and I didn't need the tylenol with codeine prescribed to me. Couldn't exercise for a while, no heavy lifting and no bending over to pick up things. After about 2 weeks, I was back to normal.",

Went back for magnification (Briads 4c) and was told I needed a stereotactic biopsy. Had the 3 areas biopsied in January. Two came back benign and the third was diagnosed as Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia. I had surgery last Wednesday to have it removed (wire localization and excisonal biopsy).  It came back totally benign. I know what you are going through, but take comfort that most of these are benign.",
