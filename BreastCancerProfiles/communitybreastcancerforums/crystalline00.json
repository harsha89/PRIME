After learning that my mother has a met on her L3 bone, and collapsed L3, and she finally couldnt even stand up because of her severe pains we had to decide for a surgery. I talked to my oncologist and he forwarded us to talk with brain surgeons for the appropriate operation. My mind was totally confused after talking with 7-8 brain surgeons because they recommended differen technics. Some of them told us that they had to remove entire L3 bone and locate a titanium cage but operaion could be risky because they could harm nerves ettc..hat would be really really difficult and risky surgery. Other surgeons recommended relatively easier surgery not to remove entire L3 but just put something between L2-L4 to strengten my moms back so she could walk again...less risky... It was difficult decision for me and I decided the 2nd option thinking of there are already distant mets and i dont want she suffers of big surgeries... Do you think i did the right thing? I am kind of anxious... Log in to post a reply",

Got cemo 4 months , underwent surgery and left breast removed (mastectomy) and herceptin for one year. Everything was going great until yesterday..we have new pet scan results showing that recurrence on left breast tissue, vertebra (bone) mets and hiler and mediastanal (i think these are about lung mets) ..so the result is really not good. We are totally devistated.. I wonder whats the survival for my mother (age 67, er- pr- her2+) i know it is not much but can she survive 2 years ? Or it is all hopeless.........
