I was told my area of firmness and lump thing is definitely just a big blob of very, very dense glandular tissue. Nothing appeared on the ultrasound. I felt a bit frustrated at that point because I was just told there was nothing there and sent back out the room. However, I then saw a surgeon. He could feel the area that I feel as a lump and said it was just very dense tissue. He did stick a syringe in it (it really didn't hurt like I was expecting) to see if it was a cyst, but wasn't able to draw anything from it, confirming that it is just tissue. The 'lump' felt very deep and wasn't very defined. It didn't move about so much because it was a large patch of breast tissue and felt attached. So samc2804, I know it's really hard, but do try to stay calm and not panic. Ignore Dr Google. The only way you can know is by seeing a specialist. ",

I can feel it when lying down, but it's harder to find when upright. It feels like it moves. But when I find it when I'm stood up, it feels fixed. I went to my GP surgery and saw a nurse. Who was not reassuring at all. She told me it was very worrying. Then didn't speak until I asked if it was anything serious. She looked at me for a while and then said, 'Maybe a cyst. But I don't know.' I was given an urgent referral, which I understand is quite standard, particularly for someone with a family history of bc. My mum died from bc after developing it in her late 30s, her sister had ovarian cancer in her early 50s. Apparently my great grandmother died from bc in her 50s, but it's something no one is clear on. I work in an industry that has resulted in my knowing an awful lot about bc. Too much. I have my appointment next week and I'm terrified. I'm 32. I now live in a shared house. My long term partner left me a year ago after cheating on me. I had to move into a shared house because I can't afford to live by myself. Just before I found the lump I had reached this point where I decided I was no longer sad about the end of my last relationship (it ended to traumatically and my life was turned upsidedown. It was an absolute shock.) and wanted to move on and date other people. Now I'm feel trapped in limbo and terrified that something is going to be found. I know far to too much about the reality of breast cancer to think I could just face it alone. The waiting is agonising. The only way I have gotten through the past two weeks is by distracting myself and spending time with friends. My friends are very much 'Oh you're too young, dont worry/you've had so much bad luck recently, you possibly couldnt have cancer.' which isn't that helpful, however, it does mean that when I'm with them I don't end up talking about it. I've avoided speaking to my family that much because one call to my sister resulted in a ripple of panic that spread across the entire family and I suddenly had everyone calling me to talk about IT, but never how I was feeling. I don't know how supportive your family is. If they are a good support network, try talking to them and letting them know how you feel. Do you have anyone going with you to the clinic? I am taking a friend. You may be there a while and it's a not a nice experience. Take someone with you so you can chat in between scans and biopsies. It's positive that your doctor said he didn't think it was anything to worry about. Take comfort in that. I wish I had that to keep me sane. I just keep thinking about the nurse I saw. She just said, 'Good luck....' as I left. I'm hoping she was just an idiot.",
