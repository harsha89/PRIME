Medical oncologist, breast surgeon and an oncologist radiologist. I just got the call yesterday after my core biopsy on 12/22. I have been diagnosed with IDC grade 3, ERPR+, Her-2 neg and a small area of DCIS. I am meeting with a team(same as mentioned above) Jan 6th. I was told that I will have more testing(scans) and lumpectomy to determine the stage and further details. She said to prepare for more surgery in the next 2 weeks and that may include a mastectomy. But you need more info to see if this can be treated with chemo or hormonal therapy before jumping the gun and getting a mastectomy right from the start. Can you access your reports online? If so, do that and come back here and share. Sounds like you may need a second opinion. Take a breath and know that you will get through this. Everyone here did.Be strongüòò ",

Surgery was 3 hours and I was in recovery for 5 hours... Vomitting, nausea, low BP. They wanted to keep me as it was approaching 9pm but I faked it the best I could and just wanted to get home. I left the patch on for the half hour ride home and then took it off. I have only taken 2 of the Vicodin prescribed and have been on reg strength Tylenol only since. I have more pain at the snb site than the lx site at the 9 o'clock position on my left breast. But it's mostly like a big bruise pain. Sometimes I get sharp pains in the nipple area, but these are quick and infrequent. Still feeling a bit week n groggy but I'm sure that's the anesthesia as they loaded me up, I'm very hyper sensitive to meds so anesthesia is like poison to me. I've showered twice now and it feels so good! No drains, no stitches, just steri trips. They automatically did the oncotype testing, took 4 nodes and I have my follow up on 2/4 to discuss results and treatments going forward. I had a nice big glass of red wine last night and it was so relaxing. For me, it's better than meds. Even just holding the glass made me feel human again and not a cut up pin cushion!! Good luck to everyone with their upcoming surgeries! It's what we have to do to move forward. This mindset helped me going into surgery... I was actually quite calm!! Now the wait game again for results but there's nothing we can do about that either. Sucks... But it was it is",

I just went through 2 weeks of testing/second opinions and I finally have a date of 1/26 for lx and snb. Yay! I chose all care to take place at Dana Farber and Brigham and Women's in Boston. MGH(first opinion) wanted to do a wire guided, but now that MRI shows 1.8cm, Dana farber surgeon is doing a radioactive seed implant. She said she's been doing them for 4 months and not one woman has had to return for clearer margins. And I cannot believe that I just bought Genie Bras today... lol! Questions... Has anyone had a seed bx? Has anyone had an MRI show the tumor twice the size of the original US? Would the core biopsy inflame it that much? LX vs MX... It's 100% up to me to decide on either. When I first found out, I was of the mindset to take both. But now that I'm more informed, sometimes the very low % of risk of reoccurrence and life expectancy between the two doesn't make sense to make such a knee jerk decision to go the mx route. And my med onc and bs both said that they don't know much until it comes out for staging, oncotype, node involvement. And I'm still waiting for genetic testing results to come back. I know it's a very personal decision. But being at Dana Farber, loving my genius doctors... I'm thinking baby steps. Take it out, check nodes, get genetic testing back and go from there. If it doesn't come back all positives... Then mx, here we come! And new boobies and tummy tuck because this has set me back a bit on the crazy exercise regime I was in; Thoughts...? ",
