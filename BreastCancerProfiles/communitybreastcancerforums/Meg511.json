I'm cool with that because now I know what to expect so it's not scary. No side effects yet but I hear that will come later. I'm just drinking tons of water to try to get it out as quickly as possible. One thing I'm reading - a lot of you guys are talking about eating fresh fruits and veggies. I was told that was a huge no-no because of the bacteria on the skin - regardless of how well it's washed. Anyone else hear this???",

Keeping my fingers crossed but staying realistic. BTW, I'm a huge coke zero girl. I've switched to regular diet just to psych myself out because then I expect it to taste different. Scary thought that I play tricks on myself...I think that defeats the purpose but in my present state of mind - all is possible.  Hang in there ladies!!!!  This too shall pass...and think about how much stronger and wiser we'll be as the result of this journey!",

I start 6 cycles of TC on 12/10 & herceptin for a year.  I had a double mastectomy on 10/29 with tissue expanders.  My nodes came back clean but because I'm HER2+ & the size of the tumor, I have to do chemo.  I am extremely fortunate to have a terrific husband and family by my side through this. My friends are amazed how well I'm handling it, but you guys know - it's freaking overwhelming.  My head is spinning.  I get frustrated because my doctors and their staff spew info out like I should be understanding it 100% but all I'm hearing is the mom and teacher from the Peanuts cartoons.  I'm not a message board kind of person, but I came across this in early November trying to make sense of what I was being told during my appointments.  I've learned some great - and scary - stuff, but all has been helpful so far.  Looks like I'm in some good company!",
