I thought I was having a needle done today.. but when I went in, she re-ultrasounded the node.. it was still there.. and still large.  So she said she'd rather do a core biopsy so she could actually take chunks of it out.. yuck :) Actually , I must say, she did an amazing job.. she did the numbing just right - I barely even felt any of the numbing shots... and did not feel any of the biopsy process! Did not feel the incision, or the removal of the node parts.  She took two node parts out.. she used the ultrasound the whole time.  After my second chunk was out, she said she saw one more spot she wanted to take out - I said go for it.  So she took that out too.  It's off to the labs.. I leave Friday for FL, and she was so nice saying she'd get the results in by then so I could come to an appointment that morning to go over the results with her. - yay for a great understand and proactive breast doctor! Anyway, I'm sure it's nothing.. but.. I'm glad she's being so proactive! I must say, I'm sore as HECK now though.... the process was not painful.. but.. right about now, I think I'd rather be recovering from childbirth than have this soreness! ugh. HOpe you all are well - thanks for listening to me through this process! I impatiently await my results on Friday..... Molly Log in to post a reply",

She said she'll know more after my results come in on Friday morning.   Oh, and I don't mind you asking! If I post it here, I kinda consider it's \"askable\" :) Thanks again for your response.. I will be anxiously awaiting Friday!  I know I must sound crazy when I talk about the process and seeing the jar was kinda \"cool\".. but.. I figure why worry when I don't know what's going on yet...and I've always been fascinated about stuff like that... I guess that comes from my family (grandpa was an MD/PHD who worked in the lab on vaccines :)) Anyway, thanks again and I will be sure to post results when they come in Friday -- hopefully, B9! At least, that's what I'm praying for!",
