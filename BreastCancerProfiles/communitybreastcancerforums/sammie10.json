Strengthening thoughts to carebear, soriya, warrior woman, and abarker for your surgery today! I got to my room post bmx with te after 9 last night and i was out the door going home to my sister's around 1 pm tues, Experiencing \"discomfort'\" in my chest and incredibly dry mouth but overall not so bad and more range of motion than imagined. Getting out of bed is hardest, i'm getting me a wooden spoon tomorrow! And a sippy cup, i think i've poured 3 cups of water down my neck so far. I tried to believe i wouldnt need someone after gettin home, but you just do.",

I had my surgery last Monday, 2nd,, BMX with TE and am really feeling good! good range of motion and having to remind myself to keep my arms at my side. Like Swimmom I found the dye injection no more painful than a flu shot, much less than a finger prick. I switched to ibuprofen ate Wed night, I think it does more for the muscle discomfort than the percoset. I feel very tight and occasionally pinched, almost a muscle cramp moment or two. Had much fun resuming BM's, not. I think the folks who advised starting stool softener early have something there. I've got a shower wand and a shower chair and it goes pretty well with some help, mostly help with the drying off. I hate the @#$ drains but at this point it is really just tedious and frustrating that I can do the stripping but can't do the clean and bandage part myself. Has anyone been able to do that part on their own?. I use an apron volunteers make for MX patients at the hospital, it is out of xmas fabric and is pretty much 2 eight inch wide pockets. .In the shower I use a cord with safety pins. My path report showed no nodes positive but I don't know how many they took. I had skin sparing, remove the nipples and unfortunately the tumor or a tumor on my right side they did not get a clean margin. So, I'm back in late tomorrow, general anesth, they will open the same incision on that side and take some more. Apparently it is not like checking lymph nodes where you can get a pretty good frozen section quickly enough to guide the surgery here (Huntsville, AL), They have to wait a couple days for the path report again to see if they get it all this time, otherwise, yadda, yadda yadda. I was really bummed late Friday when I found out but because it feels like a step back to 0, but I know people have done this and worse so. Vikki, i'm so sorry! what an awful week, like an assault. oncearunner, my daughter calls me t-rex, I just kind of flap at her Laurievp, hezzer and lydia, good thoughts for you tomorrow! sandy",

I could not find any sleeveless, button up pj tops, so I cut 4 of my camisoles down the front middle, used some satin blanket binding on the rough edges and then sewed some light velcro all the way down the new edges. Yet to sleep in them, but they go on pretty easy. - sandy",

I don't know the acronyms yet, but, 3 weeks ago I found a lump while I was showering and tomorrow, Dec 2, I am having a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I am 53 and single, one adult child at home (in college). I'm still fairly well in shock. My mother had breast cancer and what they called a modified radical mastectomy on one side 28 years ago (a survivor, a thriver, a thriving survivor?) and my Dad died of colo-rectal cancer 25 years ago after quite a fight so its not like the big C hasn't been lurking around the edges most of my adult life. But nothing really prepares you, does it? I have incredible support from my sisters. My biggest fear is of what I find out when I wake up afterwards and I hurt for my daughter. Fixing to go pack, here goes! Sandy",

(I didn't)  It was hard to get started but I did it on my own, I cut it (long hair) with scissors to about 2 inches, then used a shaver to take it down to about an inch. In retrospect, I would have done as several suggested and cut it in a very short hairstyle before it started falling out. ",
