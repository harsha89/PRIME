Then there was a complex cyst in the right breast of 5mm. He said complex cysts they would usually biopsy but because it is so small he suggested that we monitor and do another ultrasound in 6 months. If there are any changes at that time he said they would biopsy it.",

I keep telling myself they are probably just cysts and I'm going to get a call from the doctor and he will tell me everything is fine... all this worry will be for nothing and I'll fell like a dork... but then I have this anxiety over the thought of him calling and it's not all fine.... it's true the waiting is torture. My ultrasound took about 40 mins is this normal for a first ultrasound? Log in to post a reply",
