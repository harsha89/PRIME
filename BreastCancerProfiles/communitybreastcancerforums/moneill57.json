I am in my 5th week of waiting for results and I am normally a strong positive person but the wait is just getting to me.. I had my first biopsy (freehand) results that came back benign but the doctor told me that this was unexpected and has taken more extensive biopsies (ultrasound) and I will find out tomorrow night. I have a 10 year old daughter who only has me left in this worl and that is all i can think about how will it affect her. Dont feel I can tell anyone not even my own family how scared I am.
