Just diagnosed 5/9/11 at age 34 w/ Invasive Mammary Carcinoma.  I am married and have a 7 month old daughter. I am also in the same boat as many of you.  I feel as if I'm in information overload and playing the waiting game. I have been so pro-active in regards to BC... My mom was diagnosed w/ bilateral BC at age 30 & put up a great fight for 13yrs with numerous spreadings.  6 yrs ago I had the BRCA testing & I was negative.  Thought I was in the clear but then this hit me. Since I was diagnosed I have been to a breast specialist at a major cancer hospital... But I don't go back till 6/7/11 and am scared that it is just growing in my body.  I am so anxious to get this started.  My husband & I have decided on the BLMX... They have also talked to us about removing my ovaries as well.  I am thankful to hear all of the encouraging stories and to know chemo is much easier than it used to be.  I am so glad I found this sight & will look forward to reading more encouraging stories.  Hugs to all & keep up the great fight!!",

The Dr's that I see are in another state so I have been traveling, trying to keep up w/ work and a newly crawling 7 month old... Life is hectic.  I am so thankful that the Dr's say besides the fact that I have cancer everything about it is in my favor.  My BMX is scheduled for 6/30 and will be starting reconstruction at the same time.  They say a week after my surgery they will have results to see if I need chemo or not.  I am so thankful to read every ones stories and words of encouragement.  Now that a plan is set I do feel more in control.  I also found a thread of others having surgery in June and the stories of recovery are wonderful!  I hope I can check back in again soon!  Take care and hugs to all!! ",

I will have 12 weekly treatments followed by FAC starting in Oct. every 3rd week for 4 months.  I have had 4 Taxol tx and so far everything is just fine... I told my Onc that I think they gave me saline instead of the med.  The pre-meds are the worst for me... It in a lot of Benadryl whick knocks me out!  My hair did start to thin as my Onc told me it would after tx #3 but you can not tell by looking at me... I'm still holding on to it. Taxol seems to be a breeze compared to the other chemos.  Too bad I'm doing mine in reverse and the worst is yet to come for me.  Good luck today!  Praying for minimal SE's!!  Hugs!! ~Amy",

Our daughter is a joy and makes everything better at the end of the day.  Last August 4th I was put on bed rest to keep the pregnancy and this August 4th is my first chemo. We live in a neighborhood of 26 kids under the age of 13... We are very close, like family and spend time together every weekend.  I was concerned about the kids when I lose my hair or was sick.  I told the parents that I wouldn't answer any of the kids questions (in case I said the wrong thing).  They have found books on how to explain it to the kids and say they are very good.  Have a wonderful weekend!!  My hubby is taking me out on a date tonight since we start chemo next week :) ~Amy   ",

She will only hear stories of this when she is older.  I have an amazing husband and support group that will be fighting right along w/ me!  Even though they are as wonderful as can be, they do not understand the feelings and have answers like you all do.  I look forward to reading more posts and encouraging eachother along this journey. *Everyday may not be good but there is something good in everyday* ~Amy",
