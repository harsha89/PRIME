I've read a little bit of the law, but what I'm not sure of is if one insurer has to cover reconstruction when the actual mastectomy was done under a different insurer. Seems like something they'd use as a loophole. Hopefully I'll be able to find out more when I have more info on the 2nd company. My hubby was also my \"nurse\" and saw my incision before I could even bring myself to look at it. I feel so lucky to have that support. I'm headed out to look at prostheses on Friday. I'm still a bit numb but otherwise healed and tired of trying to make pillow forms stay in place...I've got a fishing lure in there right now. Not crazy about the process and the cute perky woman who does the fitting, but not ready to go all amazonian either. Anyone have any tips? Itsounds like I'm a little bit farther along (surgically speaking) than many here and in the minority as far as not having TEs/immediate reconstruction. I'll be happy to share the experience if anyone wants to hear about it.  Tory",

It went much better than I expected. I was a bit depressed about it (though I think it was the reason behind having to do it more than the act itself), but it was okay and I kind of love my prosthesis. (Apparently any kind of shopping will cheer me up!) I'm SO much more comortable now because not only does it look good, but it FEELS good. It holds my bra down and it just sort of molds to me (I had a fair amount of skin left in anticipation of reconstruction). I sat in the sun for about an hour this afternoon and even though it (and I) got pretty hot, I didn't have any perspiration behind it. The bras I chose had to have pockets sewn into them, so I only brought the form home and wanted to know how comfortable it would be directly against my skin. I have no complaints and don't really feel like I'd always need a pocketed bra. The fit is a little better with the pocket on the inside top where my chest goes a bit concave, but I don't wear tight shirts, so I doubt anyone would notice. Anyway, just thought I'd report back. Sweet dreams to all. tory",

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2010 03:43PM tory wrote: Hi everyone - Count me in for July 21st. I had a single MX on April 5th and opted at that time to not do any reconstruction until I knew what kind of treatment I was going to have to do. My BS did not recommend either immediate recon or a double MX and in retrospect I'm really glad, though it does prolong this \"journey\" (quotes because I don't really think of it as positively as that word sounds). So anyway, I'm now having a 2nd prophylactic MX and TEs on 7/21.  I'd be happy to answer any questions I can for those of you who are about to take the plunge. I'm BRCA negative but still opted for a phrophy for peace of mind (had multifocal spots in addition to the tumor) and because I kind of hate having just one breast. I have a prosthesis (HIGHLY recommend Nordstrom's!) and while it does the trick and is actually quite realistic and matches very well, I would prefer to have either two breasts or none. For a while I wasn't sure I was going to do any recon, but I've gotten pretty tired of the prosthesis. I feel like I have to wrangle it on every morning and I just spent 10 days in Colorado and Nebraska in 90+ degree heat and I felt like I had a heating pad on my chest. I wonder if they're as cold in the winter as they are hot in the summer. Of course I've heard that about implants too... Scrabblelady - I think you'll probably be okay to ride home, but make sure you have a pillow for your chest. You do not want the seatbelt touching you. I'm guessing you won't be comfortable no matter what and leaning back in a car seat might not be any better or worse than sitting in a recliner or bed, except for bumps. If you tolerate painkillers, I'd say take them and plan to sleep for the whole drive. I can't take narcotics and it was about 2 weeks before I could drive after my single MX. The worst part about it was the seatbelt. Prior to that as a passenger I pretty much had to hold it away from my chest. orchidgal - I'm curious, what specifically did you want to have done that you had to find the right PS for? If you don't mind my asking. (I'm not implying that any ol' surgeon will do, I really am just curious) in_cognito - Hi! I'm so sorry about your breastfeeding. One of the hardest things for me about all of this was how it related to my fertility and motherhood, despite the fact that I had more or less accepted that I was done with kids (mine are 4 and 7). I have an incredible amount of sadness surrounding that so I can only imagine how hard it must be for you. On the other hand, before all of this, my 2nd child weaned herself at 7 months, much to my chagrin, after I had breastfed the other for 18 months, so things don't always go as expected even without nasty cancer interfering. I found this kind of funny and sweet - the other day my 7yo daughter asked me when I was going to have the 2nd mx and after I told her she said that if I had any more kids she could take over the feeding. I'm pretty sure she didn't mean she would breastfeed, but I thought that it was sweet that she was stepping up to the plate.  One piece of advice I have for anyone who's not having immediate recon: find out how soon you can start massaging your scars! I was not told to do that and ended up having to delay recon once I decided I wanted it because I had so much scar tissue that the PS didn't want to do anything yet. I've now had to do PT for 4-6 weeks and I don't particularly enjoy it. Again, immediate recon is different and I don't know what's recommended in that case. I'm only talking about after no recon/TEs and even then I'm recommending that you find out more, not take it upon yourself to do it because I said so. Good luck to everyone! I hope Clarity04 is resting comfortably.",

I don't meet with my PS until the 12th, so I'm not sure what her instructions will be, but it seems like once TEs are involved a bra is the recommended garment. I do wonder if the drain gets in the way of the bra, though. My drain exit site was right about where my bra band would have been had I worn one. ctinas - I'm so sorry you're having a hard time. All of this sucks and it does seem like you should have a reprieve! You're in the right place to vent about it though. Maybe you should consider taking a break from reconstruction. Or is that an option if you still have one TE? I seriously considered not doing any and it seems now that I'm going through this experience, I've noticed more and more women around (airports, oddly enough), who have obviously chosen not to have recon. And I applaud them! Sometimes I think that people should SEE what we go through, though I know I wouldn't like the stares. Anyway, hugs to you.",

I don't think looking at my profile is an invasion of privacy - I chose to put that info there. Yes, I had my first mx on 4/5. My BS didn't recommend making any decisions about a 2nd (prophylactic) mx or recon until I knew more about the pathology and what treatment I'd be having and in retrospect that was the right decision for me. I opted not to do chemo based on a low oncotype score and decided to have a prophy mx based on the fact that I had multifocal DCIS in 60% of the removed breast in addition to the IDC tumor. Recon was also a tough decision for me, but now that I've been wearing a prosthesis around for a couple months, I'm pretty sure I'm on the right path (for me) with the 2nd mx and TEs coming up. You seem like you're reeling; it's a lot to deal with. I was officially diagnosed on a Thursday and had my mx on the following Monday - my choice, to minimize the freaking out factor. It took several days before I could look at my chest and I did some pretty good crying, but it does get better. Nothing will ever be the same, but as my then 6yo daughter put it, at least I'm alive. You do have to put things into perspective, or you'll drive yourself crazy. I'm insanely jealous of friends who don't have to deal with this kind of thing, who can wear v-neck t-shirts without worrying what's showing, who take nipples and breasts for granted, but I'm also quite appreciative of the fact that mine was caught early and that my prognosis is good. The hardest thing about this was probably my age; while I'm no spring chicken, everyone I know personally who has had BC has been post-menopausal (including my mother) and it's just different. Not more or less important or serious, but different. Okay, I'm starting to ramble, but my point is to let yourself freak out a little, but know that you will be okay. (BUT, if you are doubtful about having a mx, your fate is not sealed - take the time you need to be comfortable with your decision.) Tory",

It's funny, I have a terrible time making up my mind about what to order at a restaurant (and various other things), but I had no problem with that decision. I just felt there was no other choice and no sense putting it off. I did have a much harder time with the prophy/recon decisions and didn't have the option of it happening so fast as the initial mx, so that part of the equation has been different. You've been through a lot and I don't think you should feel pathetic about hesitating to remove a part of your body you've had for many many years. There's a lot to be said for accepting your body as it is (something I've never been good at), and if that's a hard-won state of mind, then I imagine it's difficult to think of having to do that again once your body has been surgically altered. Just remember it's YOUR CHOICE. If you're okay with waiting to see if it comes back, then maybe that should be a serious consideration. There are no guarantees, no matter which wayou go, so I think it's important that you feel you're making the right decision so that you can live with it. You're not being vain or self absorbed, you're just working through some difficult decisions. There will likely be more of that no matter what you decide.

I wonder why just one of them hurts. Maybe it's sitting near a nerve or something. What a drag! I have been reminded of how much I absolutely hated the drains, but I try to console myself by comparing them to what another BCO member said she had in England - their drainage containers are HUGE, like milk cartons. I suppose I can suffer through this stupid bulk around my middle if she made it through with those awful things. calamtykel - those sensations do sound familiar, but I don't remember them being much better when the steristrips came off. It just took time and lots of very gentle stretching. As for the burning, I found that ice helped, but of course don't put it directly on your skin. Strength and healing to all.",

I had expected to have to fight for one of them to come out, but the PA who will be doing all my fills said that the drains aren't as crucial with TEs as they are with no recon because if there's fluid built up they just draw it off on the way out with the fill needle. It's definitely different this time around than with my first mx - the side where I had already had the mx feels and looks great.  I'd say there's definitely an argument for delayed recon, even though it means more surgery. That said, in my case I should probably stick to as few surgeries as possible, since I have trouble with the narcotics they give under anesthesia. Normally I come to vomiting, but this time I did it before I was even awake, so they were worried I might have aspirated and I came to with them manipulating me into place for chest x-rays. Not fun, but it looks like I didn't aspirate and that's in the rear view mirror now. The path report was good on the prophy side (as expected) and now I'm just working on getting enough sleep on my back - I hate that part. Strength & healing to all, Tory",

There's a great site you should check out: http://breastfree.org/index.php for all kinds of info for those who decide to forgo reconstruction. I've been on the fence since I first got a look at my flat chest and realized it wasn't so bad. And yesterday I jogged out to our mailbox and did not miss the bounce at all. I haven't gone without a form of some kind in public because I'm really uncomfortable with one boob, but I think that if I weren't lopsided I'd try the flat thing. Who needs them! And then again, I'm not sure I'm ready to deal with flat or prostheses for the rest of my life, but I am glad I haven't had immediate recon and have a chance to make sure I make the right decision. Cafelovr - Good for you! Like I was getting at above, I think there's way too much emphasis being placed on reconstruction, especially the immediate kind. I also feel that there needs to be a period of mourning and I'm not sure if that's possible without a delay. And I do have that poofy thing too, but it does seem to be getting a little better (my surgery was the day before yours and only uni). It still feels tender, so I'm hoping I just haven't given it enough time.",

There are times when it's just all so overwhelming and you need to be able to step back and take a break sometimes. On the other hand, I suspect opting out of something like your son's graduation might be something you'd regret missing later. NEODonna - what an ordeal! I hope you're on the mend. I'm not surprised at the level of fatigue you have. You've been through a lot!  jessamine - my heart goes out to you! Out of everything the drain was the thing I hated the most! It doesn't sound like it could be terribly effective if it's coming out, either. The day I got mine out I went shopping, not for anything in particular, but just because I could walk around a store and feel more or less free to move however I wanted and not worry about how I looked and whether a bloody tube was showing. Good luck - I'm crossing my fingers that they take it out SOON! Irishtess - thanks for the explanation of the poofs. I had been trying to decide if I had that same thing on my unaffected side but just didn't recognize it because it feels different on the mx side, but what you said about the breast pulling on it makes total sense. I hope you're still feeling okay from your first treatment. Off to the treadmill (ugh). Happy Tuesday to everyone!",

I had been looking for info on prosthetics (need to heal a bit more before I venture out to shop) and was sitting here irritated by the post-op cami form and realizing the only reason I'm wearing the stupid thing is to not scare my little girls  (while at the same time thinking they'd probably be less fazed by it than adults).  I'm less than 2 weeks past a unilateral mastectomy, but I'm already thinking maybe I don't want to go through the reconstruction rigamarole.  I'm finding lots of good info and confidence boosters on breastfree. I'm not claiming that it hasn't been difficult and challenging to my self-esteem, but probably the strongest thing I'm feeling is that now I just want the other one gone too. I'm lucky enough to be in a very supportive, long-term relationship and don't feel the need to reconstruct for him, so maybe I won't for me either!  Or maybe I will, but at any rate it's nice to see such a positive approach to going without.

Hopefully once you start you'll just take it a day at a time and get through it without too much difficulty. Everyone always says it's such a short time compared to the rest of your life and that seems like a good thing to try to keep in perspective. Keep up the positive thoughts and good luck! jdoubow - Getting those drains out sure feels great, doesn't it? It's the little things in life! My doctor just said to go for the prosthetic whenever I was ready. I probably could have done it before now, but I knew I wanted to try the ones that stick to your skin, so I kept waiting for the steri-strips to fall off my incision and they wouldn't. I finally had to have my husband pull them off (I'm totally incapable of that kind of thing-I'd probably faint in the process) and everything was pretty much healed underneath. I'm really tired of trying to support my one breast, so that's my main motivation for going now. HantaYo - I'm totally with you on the belly thing - I could pretend it wasn't there so much better when there were breasts in the way!  Hopefully you can hang on at work a little longer so you don't have to switch doctors and everything. If money weren't an issue I'd just pay the Cobra for the convenience of keeping everything I'm already familiar with, but that's hard to justify. Mine is a little over $400 a month, so until I know more about the coverage on the new plan, I don't know if that's worth paying or not. Nice to have to deal with that along with the cancer stuff, huh? Like life isn't stressful enough yet.",

Going out in public is much less stressful for me now, though I do still look at people leading their \"normal\" lives with envy (even though I'm sure there are plenty who only LOOK normal). I had trouble with the bras and how tight they were at first too, especially under my arm, but I seem to have gotten used to it. They still have a tendency to fall right where my skin/tissue slopes off pretty drastically on the front side of my armpit so I find myself adjusting there pretty frequently, but I suppose there's nothing to be done for that. I started PT too, but to massage the scar tissue (wish someone had told me that earlier!) and the next time I see her I'm going to ask about what I think is cording. Everything else is loosening up nicely and I even have pretty good range of motion, but under my arm is just weird - kind of painful and hard. I imagine whatever she has me do I won't like. jdoubow - I didn't have much trouble with pain, but I did have lots of weird feeling (itching, zinging, etc) and my surgeon's nurse recommended that I use ice packs, which I did every time my armpit started acting up (and sometimes my chest in between my collar bones where you wouldn't expect it felt like it had been sunburned) and it helped tremendously! I also found some camisoles at Targe that I could wear that were tight unlike the post-surgical ones. Wearing them tight seemed to minimize the amount of movement of fabric against sensitive parts.
