Also I have a band across my wound and 2 seromas (blister swellings) at the top and across myÂ  arm/boob each side of my wounds the nurse suggested I move the band up to the swelling but if I do the liquid has nowhere to go but to my wounds which will possibly split open with the swelling has anyone any experience of the band after surgery?",
