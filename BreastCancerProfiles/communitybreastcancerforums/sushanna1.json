It has almost resolved thanks to a wonderful p.t. Unlike my hand lymphedema, I haven't figured out the best way to deal with it on my own.  Just when I think it is gone for good, it returns.  Not sure if this is helpful or not.  The trouble is that no one can accurately, predict who will develop lymphedema.  While you are presumably increasing your risk of lymphedema, it does not mean that you will develop it.    Good luck making your decision.   ",

Now I try to pack in phases, put my suitcase on a bed or table and use two lightweight bags instead of one overstuffed one.  I travel with a small rolling bag and a small well-padded knapsack.  If I have to pack at the last minute, I wear my sleeve and glove while packing.  Good luck and travel safe.  ",

Fortunately, I owned a pair of Birkinstocks.  The other side effect was tearing.  Tamoxifen caused the tear ducts to constrict and my eyes watered constantly.  My advice is to watch out for the various side effects and don't hesitate to bring them up with your doctors.  They can work with you to mitigate some of the problems. My guess is that it will be easy for the first 2 and a half months then slowly become more difficult.  By the way, my doctor said that not everyone loses their hair on taxotere so maybe you will be one of the lucky ones.  You can do this.  Good luck.  Sue PS I also lost my tastebuds, but it took a while so eat up now.",

Ask your surgeon for a referral to a physical therapist as per Binney's advice. A  P.T. with experience in treating lymphedema will be able to diagnose you quickly and teach you exercises to help it resolve.  My old (c. 2001) copy of Susan Love's Breast Book mentions cording so you may want to borrow a copy and show it to the nurse.  (I think this pre-dates the research resulting in the term \"axillary web syndrome.)  Good luck.",

Good luck.",

I have small breasts so I slept without a bra fairly soon after surgery.  (I was advised to wear a compression bra for a given number of days post surgery.  I can no longer remember the exact number, but I think that it was three.)  Make sure that the bra opens in the front.  The first surgeon issued me a cotton top resembling a tube top but with a velcro seam up the front.  (Normally she gives patients a compression bra, but I was too small breasted!)  Before the lumpectomy, I bought two front zipper sports bras.  By the way, I liked the tube top so much, I wore it as a regular summer top and would still be wearing it if I were a few pounds lighter.",
