The home care nurse said it was due to the stiches scratching my skin, but I'm not sure it was just that. I was just on Tylenol extra-strength - it only helped a little but I was afraid of taking Tylenol 3's. When the nurse removed the drains (after 10 days), the right side went well, no pain, but the infamous left side hurt since it seems the surgeon had closed the hole really tight. I then had leakage from that side that was quite bad (went through the gauze and 3 layers of clothes), I changed the gauze and put another mastectomy bra I had that was tight, and it seems that the compression helped and stopped it. The next day, everything was good, and no pain! So good luck, I don't think there's much you can do about this pain other than take whatever medication you have, but it will soon be over. You will be so happy to have your (new) body back after the drains are out!",

Following the meeting with the genetics counsellor where I learned the results, appointments were made with a doctor at an Ovarian Cancer Clinic (for testing and consultation on potential next steps like oopherectomy), and with a breast cancer doctor. I then had a mammogram and MRI, just for a baseline, but breast cancer was found from this exam and here I am. When I got the BRCA result, it took some time to sink in, but at some point I realized that my life was going to be different from now on. Either I was going to need more tests for the rest of my life, or go through surgery, or whatever. But life is different and I still have a hard time accepting it. Me, sick? Nah! I get strength from knowing that I am actually lucky to have found this BC early on, because of the BRCA. Same with the potential ovarian cancer - once I have a oopherectomy/hysterectomy (later this year?), I won't have to go through ovarian cancer like one of my aunts did. I also get strength for knowing that I have to go through a tough 1-3 years, but after that, my life won't be consumed by cancer anymore -it will always be there (the monitoring, etc.), but it won't take over my life. Your children give you this reason to live, so whatever you choose to do in the coming months, you know it will be to ensure you are there for them for the long term. Here's my limited knowledge - for breast cancer, you basically have 3 options: prophylactic mastectomy, tamoxiphen, or regular mammograms. BC is relatively easy to detect, so I personally don't think you need to rush for surgery if you're not ready (of course, assuming you have no BC already ). For ovarian cancer, it is supposedly difficult to detect and when it is detected, it is often at an advanced stage. This is why oopherectomy was strongly suggested to me. However, I was told that women with the BRCA2 mutation have a higher chance than the general population of getting ovarian cancer mainly once we turn 40. So ovary removal might not be something doctors will urge you to do yet. However, please consult your doctors, this is just the little info I have. I hope you have access to knowledgeable genetics counsellors and cancer specialists where you live. Try to obtain as much information as you can, and choose what is right for you. The FORCE website (http://www.facingourrisk.org/) is a good place to read up on all this. Keep in touch and good luck!",

It's Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide then Docetaxel (same as Taxotere). Supposedly the SEs are similar, but my hospital gives AC-T for different pathologies than mine. Also, is anyone planning to work during the coming months? I have a hard time imagining being home for 18 weeks, but not sure if I want to deal with the stress of work and worrying about how I look to my colleagues and the downtown crowd through this crap.

I applaud the ones who have had their first treatment, and thanks for sharing your experiences. paloverde- I'm BRCA2+ also, I found this BC just from the supposedly \"baseline\" mammogram I had after finding our about the mutation. So good thing it was caught early! Yes, from what I hear, FEC-D is popular in Canada and maybe also UK/Australia. No idea why doctors in one country prefer one treatment over the other. We'll trust them, I guess! Calmandstrong - hi, fellow Torontonian! Are you getting treatment at PMH? We'll compare notes on our SEs! Yes, of course as an ICU RN, you would need the time off, for so many reasons. I'm an IT project manager, so I have the flexibility of working from home and don't have a physically demanding job. We'll see how it goes, though. I'm glad I proposed this work arrangement to my manager, though, since I found out that his mother did exactly the same thing during her chemo last year. I probably would have seemed weak to tell him I will be off for the full 5 months!  Anyway, it does not matter, who knows how my body will react and if I will have the physical and mental strength to work, we'll adjust as needed. Lisacm, nancyjeanne, carpevinum, Paula, and all - so nice to meet you. I have a 5 yr old son and will tell him about chemo this weekend. I have this book from a local support group to help explain BC to kids, hopefully it will help. I will be open and straightforward with him, but try not to scare him. He has been great with the BMx, but he has said things like \"It's good that you look like you have breasts [with the fake boobs] so that kids don't laugh when you picl me up at daycare\"... Kids are affected by appearances, but deep down, all they care about is that their mother is alive and well. Right? lisacm - i think you did a great service to your friends inciting them to get mammograms. Why not? Some men are so concerned about what others think, and how this is private. But it's not, it's women's health! Paula, thanks for all your great advice for us, newbies. Warrior_Woman, I've seen you on some exercise thread. Unfortunately, I have not been able to run since an infection landed me in the hospital over the holidays. I miss it terribly and since this infection triggered some LE in one of my arms, I've been told not to run for another 2-3 weeks, to not take chances of getting fluid build-up again. Crap! How is it going for you? stephaniege - where are you in Canada? I'm going to a wig place this weekend, I hope I will be able to get one I like, looks like my hair (curly), and can wear.. Chemo will really test my pride, I guess it will have to go out the window! It's going to be like shock therapy... Anyway, I'll get a short hair cut a week later, then chemo starts... My head is spinning from all the things I should get, prepare, etc. I've been copying/pasting from all the tips/shopping list thread, etc., i'm at 16 pages! I'm such a loser! Reading some of the stories here, there are so many ladies who have been through so much. It's a real honour to spend the next few months with you!",

I was in and out within 3 hours, did not have to wait much and did not need bloodwork today since I have it on Tuesdays when I see the MO. I was a little nervous before, but still had a great night of sleep, which helps put up with whatever awaits us during the day!  No reaction to anything and feeling fine now, was told by the nurse to take it easy today so that I'm not too exhausted tomorrow. Having Neulasta shot tomorrow at the hospital, will likely do the future ones myself. Taking Claritin now just like people on the board have recommended. I hope everyone who had their first treatment today are doing well (dgdm, seanibopp and anyone else). tekwriter - i had a bmx (reconstruction will  be later) but I needed it since I had DCIS throughout both breasts. I'm BRCA2 so I knew I wanted them off if any cancer at all was found, so that, as you say, we worry less the rest of our lives. The surgery went really well and I recuperated well. I did have an infection 4 weeks later, but not everyone has one. I also have slight lymphedema in my right arm triggered by that infection, but it's manageable. It's really just you who knows if surgery is the right thing for you or not, and when it is. Since you're going through chemo now, you might want a break from medical procedures before going through something else. Good luck and feel free to ask anything!",

It will be tough though, I don't even want to think myself about it right now... Just came back from the wig store, found one that they will perm to \"match\" my curls. Seems like the price was ok for real hair: $1800 and insurance pays for $1500, so I'm lucky.

I hope they are not hurting much now or that they will stop hurting once the fills are done. Thanks for the info on LGFB, it's so useful to hear from someone who has been to one of these sessions! I now know that I should wait until treatment start to attend, and that I should not be wearing make-up (or not much) beforehand. Precious info! Personally, I don't think I'll go bald except inside the house, but I don't know if the wig I'll eventually get will bother me. We'll see. diamond, congrats on the haircut! Interesting thought to bring the wig to your hairdresser, I'll probably do that too since I really trust mine. stephaniegee, FEC-D is another chemo protocol, I think it's very similar to AC-T (at least the D drug is very similar to T), it's what I'm getting and what I see a few other Canadian ladies getting on bco. But I don't know much more! Sorry about the mouth pain, I hope the advice from the others help. I shopped for a few chemo things today and told my son about this upcoming treatment, with the help of the kids book. It went well, but I think it's big news for him to absorb. Funny comment from DH about hair, I was saying how being done with chemo will test my patience since the hair growth will probably be slow, and it will take a while to have it down to my shoulders like I have it now. He said, \"If you finish chemo in May, it will be to your shoulders by September, no?\" WTF??!!! He said yeah, judging by how often he needs to cut his hair! He's a little clueless in this area!",

Of course, if a friend is available to come for a few hours during those first days, it would be ideal, but life is not always that way. Good luck, we will be thinking about you. Hi desimone, I'm glad your WBC was better and you were able to get your 2nd AC. I think it will be discouraging if/when we start to have our chemos delayed because of low WBC. I've been told just the regular common sense stuff for keeping WBC high enough, like staying away from germs, resting, or even trying to improve your red blood cells by eating more iron (spinach, liver, etc.) which can't hurt your overall health. belleb, I hope you were well enough for your daughter's birthday and you had a good rest after! She must have been just so happy to have you part of the celebrations! Day #3 for me after first chemo and still feeling good. I'm taking it really easy with activities and food, and nausea and fatigue have been very manageable up to now. A few more days of being careful, then I will ease back into work and more normal meals. Maybe I'm being too careful but it's working for me for now!",

We'll see this weekend! I'm envious of the ones who have started reconstruction at the same time as the mx/ bmx. My BS had advised me to delay recon since we did not know if I would need chemo or radiation, and treatments (particular radiation, I guess) could complicate the reconstruction... I think she was being way too careful. It's so common to get these surgeries done at the same time and get treatment after. I'll have to go through a full surgery (and time off) when I'm ready for recon. I really should have asked for a second opinion. I'm not one to question \"experts\" and what she was saying was rational, but it was likely way too conservative and will be a pain in the butt in the future. Oh well, can't think about this now!
