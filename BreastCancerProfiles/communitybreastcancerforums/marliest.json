The biopsy went fine, no pain, didn't even feel the first needle stick of novacaine. I just hate having to wear this pressure dressing with a huge binder for 24 hours. I'm now having some pain, but i don't know if it's from the binder or the biopsy . It's been 6 hours since the biopsy. I do have a question, and I think I'll ask the docs, there are blood tests out there that can detect different kinds of cancers - that's how men KNOW they have prostate cancer - from the PSA test, and (I work in a nursing home) by accident we found a woman to have colon cancer: her blood was drawn and the secretary checked the test for colon cancer by mistake. I googled blood tests for cancer and found there are several blood tests that can detect breast cancer. Maybe you can ask your docs about this--but getting them to try something new is like pulling teeth. Our doc at the nursing home didn't even want to try a new supplement to help prevent bladder infections (highly recommended) because he never heard of it, and if HE hadn't heard of it, it couldn't be any good, and all it is is highly concentrated cranberry juice. We finally convinced him to try it. Back to you: If you can deal with pain and the docs let you, I'd do it all at one time, just to get it over with, and to keep the cost down. I'm 45 and have a paternal aunt who had breast cancer in her 70s. Maternal side is full of Alzheimer's disease--and I feel like I'm already there many days . I wish you luck, and maybe it's just fibroids or something.",
