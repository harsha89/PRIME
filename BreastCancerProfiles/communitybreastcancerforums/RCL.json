    "Content": "RCL wrote: After being on Aromosin for a couple of years, I was taken off due to severe back pain which then became the start of \"degenerative disc disease\".  Never had a back issue until the Aromosin.  It is almost 9 years later (stage 2b), am in my 50's and suddenly I noticed a large lump starting from mid back to the front of my abdomen right on my waist line.  My back has also gotten worse.  In the past 4 wks, have had xrays & an ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed a large mass but nothing else.  Am scheduled to meet with a surgeon in abt 4 wks but am wondering if anyone has had anything remotely similar?  PCP ruled out hernia.  I am leaning toward a torn ligament/muscle from the L-1/L-2 discs as this strange looking bulge sits at the approx level of those 2 discs.  Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
