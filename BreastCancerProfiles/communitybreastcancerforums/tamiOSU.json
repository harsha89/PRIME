I\u2019ve been looking around the website for a discussion to join\u2026.and came across Ohio Chemo Sisters this morning.  I\u2019m from Dublin Ohio, being treated at the Stephanie Spielman Breast Center and this is my second round with BC.  In Nov after a routine quarterly check-up, my oncologist ordered an MRI that indicated a return of my DCIS.  Subsequent biopsy, and pre-op testing for my scheduled mastectomy/ reconstruction revealed a tumor on my liver.  After numerous tests\u2026the good news\u2026it was the only met\u2026but long story short\u2026all breast activity was put on hold and I started chemo the Thursday of Christmas week.  Not sure how many treatments I will have, they will do scans after #4 to see what the plan is.  I have #3 tomorrow (Taxotere/Herceptin/Perjeta) and have tolerated the first two well.  Yes, I am as bald as bald can be\u2026but if that\u2019s what it takes to kick cancer a$$ then I\u2019m all in!  Looking forward to hanging out with you all in cyber space.
