It's unknown how many lymph nodes are positive but it's at least one. Also, it's Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. The doctor really sounded like she doesn't recommend chemotherapy... and I understand (if there was one thing I didn't want out of all this, it's for my mom to have to go through chemo!) but I would rather her go through that than have the cancer come back, ya know?? You all are such a blessing  ",

We're blessed to live about half an hour away from the Susan G. Komen center. Top notch, I tells ya! There were several doctors we spoke to, including an oncologist and a breast surgeon. And when my mom had the biopsy, they only removed one lymph node and it tested positive. Of course they are tentative about chemo until after the mastectomy (understandable) and also after the MRI (my mom had a panic attack and has to do it again). But our oncologist started out by saying that she didn't want ot use chemo unless absolutely necessary. My parents were thrilled, that's the one thing they didn't have to go through. But I was scared. If they didn't use chemo now... my mind started to wander, you know? Thank you all so much! I can't even tell you how much it means to have people like you who have been through it able to come alongisde and support us and answer questions. ",

She said she's meeting with a bunch of doctors early next week. What's the purpose of the MRI?? ",
