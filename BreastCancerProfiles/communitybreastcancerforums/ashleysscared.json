It feels heavy and full and it hurts!!  today was a new symptom, nipple discharge. gross, but true. saw doc today and she said maybe she will push for an mri or for a breast surgeon... i asked for a punch biopsy and she said my nuts, i dont have ibc cause i dont have the peau de orange.  one sypmtom... really?!?!?!
