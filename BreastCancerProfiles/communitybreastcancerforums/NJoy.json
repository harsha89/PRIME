I have been going a bit off the deep end this weekend trying to keep my worry in check and not pass my fears on to my 2 boys . ( 13 & 20 ) to whom I have said nothing.  My scans were Friday which is never good in trying to handle things over a weekend... and my onc has not yet seen the films but said the radiologist's report said there were a number of leisons and they were leaning toward mets ...  I agree entirely on the second opinion and plan to call my breast surgeon on Monday to see if she can fit me in ....  I always feel like there is such an urgency about making these critical decisions and I have to slow myself down so as not to make fear based decisions. I had such a wonderful summer and feel so good after coming through two surgeries in the last 3 months ... just dont understand how you can feel so good and be so sick?! Clearly thats the blessing.... hopefully these leisions are benign and I can move on to other happier things .... I just wonder if the radiologist puts that in the report to cover himself or if what he saw fit certain guidelines indicative of metastatic disease? ... I appreciate your words and felt calmer as I was reading them ... thanks again so much ...  blessings to you ...",

I had two surgeries 3 months apart and after each one the CA 27/29 elevated .. the second time it was 49 ...  not crazy high but out of range ...onc thought it was from inflammation after surgery but had me do a full body bone scan and an abdominal/pelvic/lung CT ..  scan came back showing leisons on my liver ...  largest of which is 2 cm ...  onc wants to now do a biopsy to confirm mest but my research seems to indicate that biopsy can spread cancer and scans are typically used for diagnosis ....  my onc says that biopsy yields critical info regarding receptors and I totally understand this ....  scared to do it .... scared not to ...if anyone can share their experience and knowledge with me I would greatly appreciate it ... blessing to you all ..njoy",

I went for my 3 month check up in September and my CA27/29 was elevated to 49 ... not crazy high but out of range .... my first surgery was in April and the marker had elevated to 32 at my May visit .... went down to 29 in early June ....  2nd surgery was June 25th and then it went back up to 49 by September.  Onc thought it might be from inflammation after surgery but sent me for bone and CT scan ...  everything looked good except for my liver ... report says multiple, ill-defined hepatic lesions suggestive of metastases!....I feel like someone hit me square in the face with a brick ....  how can I feel so good and hear this news? Onc wants me to have a biopsy but some of my research seems to indicate that biopsies should not be the first course of action ?? can spread the cancer and may limit some treatment choices as well ??.... Im torn because I clearly know that there is no way Im going to treat something with chemo unless Im really really sure it need to be treated ....is that possible without a biopsy?? Im thinking no ...  reading your posts I see that biopsies are highly recommended ....  Im so scared I cant breath sometimes ....  I have a 13 year old too and I dont want him to be scared so I have said nothing ...Im praying for a miracle that maybe these lesions are benign .... my onc called the hospital to set up the biospy and when they called me to schedule I thought about the fact that I have never heard of the doctor whose doing the biopsy (diagnositic radiologist ?) so how do you just go and have someone you know nothing about biopsy you ....  I have a call into my breast surgeon who does not do biopsies but she is the head of breast surgery at Overlook Hospital in Morristown, N.J. and I have asked her to take a look at the report and maybe she can direct me to a doctor that she knows to do the biopsy ... so Im functioning with moments of terror and I was not happy to see the words \"ill-defined\" on the report ...  on a positive note ....  there were no other findings that would indicate that there may be trouble somewhere else and for that I am deeply grateful....  would welcome your thoughts ....  God Bless",

I keep reminding myself that I have only had this diagnosis for less than a week although it feels like a lifetime already....

I have also recently realized that now might be a good time for me to look into therapy to get a grip on the fear and more recently the anger at being newly diagnosed with liver mets....  I have found some things very helpful in controlling these emotional waves that I can share here.... because my Iiver is so compromised I hesitate to take xanax,  although I will if absolutely needed.  My nutritionist recommended an amino acid known as L-Theanine which is a wonderful calming supplement once you have found your dosage.   This supplement is not addictive and has no toxic effects... please google it and see its benefits ... Im about 5'8.... 180 pounds and I take 4 caps of 200 mg strength.  Also while you are on the computer search for EFT. ie Emotional Freedom Technique a/k/a Tapping.  Look up Nick Ortner... this calming technique has brought me a great amount of relief from anxiety. Its kind of a combination of Ancient Chineese accupresure and modern psychology.  This technique can be done anywhere,  done on yourself and speaks to the \"flight or fright\" response that we all have as we navigate through this cancer thing in survival mode... Just as a comment to your struggle with G-d ... I get it totally and I think its part of the process ... dont beat yourself up for feeling abandoned by G-d and know that just because we might choose to walk away right now does not mean that we can never find our way back to our more positive feelings toward  G-d ...  I just think its ok to give those feelings an expression .... its what makes us human.  Sure we need to be strong and hopeful and thats a great way to be and sometimes it just plain sucks and its ok to feel pissed off about that .. you're not made of stone and neither are any of us ...  hang in there sister .. thanks for helping me see that Im not alone in what Im feeling..... blessings to you ....
