Techs told me that they would now be taking X-rays until the end of treatment. I asked why and they said \"to ensure everything was positioned properly\". Doesn't make sense so I will ask the doc on Monday when I see him again. Even though the drive to radiation is easy, it does take an hour to get there.

The eyelashes and eyebrows have thinned but are still hanging on; I think the remaining will stick around - the thinning really occurred two weeks ago (about 4 weeks out from the last TC chemo treatment). Thanks for the update on Femara; I start in a couple of weeks..... the docs want to make sure that I am over chemo and radiation SEs before I start another phase of our treatment. onehalf/denise - I don't think chemo (at least TC) has any effect on radiation burns. I started radiation (dose dense even!) two weeks from my last chemo treatment and I had only a slight reddening and just a little irritation on the SNB scar. My skin tone is average; not dark or light skinned. Just as the radiation onc said...... they cannot determine who will have problems. He also said not to use any creams to prevent problems - they don't work! So during the 16 sessions I only used lotion once - at the beginning.... that was before he told me not to use any! The radiation department gave me Aquaphor at the end just in case my redness/irritation increased and so I would not have to go in to get the tube. I've not needed it; I am just using normal lotion as I do on the rest of my body. So definitely talk to the radiation team! You seem to have a strong reaction to radiation!!!!!!  JeanneM - I ate jello during chemo, I'll start back up again! As you said it cannot hurt.... and I am like Mary5454.... still no hair growing (almost 6 weeks out). Mary L ",

Regarding positioning - the rad onc showed my DH and me how the x-ray imagaing matches the CT scan when we are positioned properly. That is why they X-ray us prior to the treatment; once they are convinced that the positioning will always be good then they may not x-ray every time.  I had my 6th session today (9 more to go) and have very few effects; sometimes a little tenderness, but I am still wearing my normal bra. I have not used any lotions or creams and do not notice any skin difference between the two breasts. I am still recovering from chemo, but my diminishing of chemo SEs must be more than the increasing fatigue of radiation..... Recently I am feeling more energetic every day.

I'm still feeling OK (just maybe a slight feeling of coming down with a cold).... may be tough to be motivated to go out walking - the temperature is 25°, breezy, and light snow. My steroid medicine should start wearing off about 11:00 (EST) and I will give an update on that effect. I too asked if I should be weaned from it and the onc said \"no\" my dose was so low it really shouldn't be a factor.  4:00 pm - Well, I am definitely achey but not bad - more like a tensioning of the shoulder muscles. Actually hungry for baked spaghetti, bread, anything in the carb family - but not sweets. I kept busy and walked/ran for 2.5 miles this morning. Drinking 51 - 68 oz or water/day and eating light numerous meals. Colleen, VTMama, how are you doing? Good luck to the 12/5 ladies!  Mary",

I just kindly say, \"thank you for sharing that..... that is why I am fighting this!\". Many people are ignorant regarding the different types and stages and I really don't want to educate them. What is nice are the women who come up and say \"you are where I was X years ago\" and offer true support. God has surrounded me by many friends and family who are truly supportive and I therefore can tolerate the tactless ones. And speaking of tactless - THAT IS YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY!!!!!!!! Do you have any recourse? Lisa -  Thanks for the story, I keep thinking that God is having me go thru doors I don't want to go....... but when I am through, I always praise Him because of how my life has ALWAYS changed for the better. Already, I have been able to use this cancer to help others that are hurting.....  By the way, baldness does have advantages.... I took a nap and didn't have to worry about mussing my hair. Fortunately it is cold here and wearing a hat while shopping was the norm! To all the ladies having chemo today, (and there are lot!) hope your day went smoothly and you finally get a restful night. Mary ps Lisa and SDavis tonight we are having pasties. My sister had bought some at the 1st UMC in Manistique and brought them to me. I think they have the best pasties in the whole UP ",

After I cut my hair I went out and had \"the new me\" girls' outing. It was fun and a great way to acclimate friends on my new look! So your party could be the same way. My friends knew it was all coming and that also stopped the \"when will the hair go?\".  Thanks all for the nuelasta advice: In the belly, warm it first, make sure you have meds for pain! I take my shot tomorrow night. The nurse said to take it just before I go to bed; that way I can sleep for the first part of this experience. I was also told that some people experience much more pain..... age and fitness are factors. Cebula - Thanks for the additional info on Vitamin C. I too had just heard not to take supplements, but otherwise no restrictions except for when the WBC is low..... don't eat fresh food.  Texas357 - Glad you are back! What a grueling regimen! I try to look at our journey one day at a time - if I look too far forward it gets depressing; I only focus on the trying time. Cebula - how nice you also got hats! I thoroughly enjoyed our class and my daughter wants to share in the goodies. I will probably let her have some because I will not use all they gave me!  2nd treatment TC - day 1: Still had an allergic reaction even though they upped the Benedryl. So they also put me in Tagamet and that took care of the problem. I asked if this would a problem for the next session and was told that they can up the dose of Benedryl. So I feel good except for being sleepy from all the Benedryl. Also am drinking LOTS of water!!!!! My goal is 4 qts today. ",

Can't believe the port bit.... can you imagine the number of people that would never accept a port and have problems getting the IV started for chemo treatment? I didn't need a port, but I NEVER would have agreed to one if I was borderline and thought it would never come out. Day 12 - TC #3 - A little tired today; I know they say a lowered WBC doesn't cause tiredness, but since this is the third time I've experienced this at this time........ Other than taking a nap today I feel fine. I still have my lashes and eyebrows, the nails look fine, and no neuropathy. The taste buds are still off - salt is still detestable and sweets unappetizing. Love those veggies and meats. I do think that I have lost muscle tone and my skin is less supple. ",

The flu is going around here and I caught it from my daughter; fortunately I had the flu shot so I only had a couple days of misery - and was able to continue with the radiation treatments. Radiation (#12 of 16 dose dense sessions) has been easy - very slight reddening and tenderness.

I don't know who posted about rinsing the mouth..... but I am drinking many fluids, rinsing every couple of hours with water and have had no problems. Cannot believe the onc wants you to lose weight while on chemo!!!!! We have enough issues without adding that stress!!!!!! CINDAD - What a sorrow. Pray that you and your family are still enjoying remembering the time you did have with her. TC #2 - Day 6: As usual days 4 and 5 I was fatigued. I did manage to walk a couple of miles on day 5 but it was a struggle. The Nuelasta shot technique of pre warming must have helped, the shot was no big deal. But the ache (even with meds) made day 4 and 5 even rougher. Today went to church, walked, and have felt comfortable; though lazy. ",

Fortunately my skin did not break down, I only have some nipple tenderness and a red/rough area on my SNB scar. Already two days out and the skin is already healing. My rad onc said not to use creams/lotions. They are concerned about the ingredients interfering with the radiation treatment. In his experience they do not prevent skin damage and the techs agreed. Now, I am using a normal hand lotion to soothe. If a rash or skin openings appear then they have a cream for that.  Mary L ps Went to the high school's spring play - Anne Frank.

If you haven't already, let others help you in all routine tasks; and you concentrate on what makes you feel better.  Have you tried the various beverages that others said that helped the dry mouth? Ginger Ale, cranberry juice, helped for me, as well as plain distilled water, and I discovered that salt is what caused the bitter/detestable taste. So this may sound silly... but unsalted McD's french fries with a plain hamburger tasted wonderful. The grease felt really good in my mouth. Plus you need a lot of protein while going through with Taxotere. Meatloaf was another winner.....

I too am waiting for SEs.  Lisa - When I went in for lumpectomy I was told they would take out 2 sentinel nodes to check for cancer. They would do the \"quick\" test during surgery and if appeared cancer free, then only do a lumpectomy; but the nodes would be sent out for more accurate testing and if showed cancer then additional surgery would be needed. Could it be that this is their standard procedure? If so, they should have told her that BEFORE surgery. It is GOOD that you can prepare her with appropriate questions! Hard to make decisions on your treatment when you don't have the info! 1.  Does she have someone going with her to the appointments - helps to have two sets of ears, two sets of questions. New info from doc always created new questions and my DH would ask good additional questions that I wouldn't have thought of. Then the two of us had a better understanding of what was happening. 2.  Next, is her doctor willing to spend the time with her so that she does get the information she needs? Mary L ",

Cannot believe that you were not given advice/meds for the neupogen shots. Excruciating pain is a common SE! Make sure you know the side effects of any meds...... that way you can be proactive with ways to make yourself comfortable. I've learned a lot from these forums and that has helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of chemo effects. As far as wigs, check with your American Cancer Society; they have a wig bank here in my area for anyone that asks. I suspect that is true elsewhere. Mary ",

Pasties (and I am referring to Cornish pasties) are made with an 8 oz mixture of ground round, onion, potatoes, and seasoning; then wrapped in a type of pie dough. It then can be eaten like a turnover. Many people also like to add rutabaga, carrots, substitute chicken, etc .... but I don't like those combinations as well.

Not as much pain from the Nuelasta shot this time - so that is a big relief. I was asking the onc nurse about trying to diminish the fatigue that I get on days 4 and 5 and she said it was due to a low red blood cell count. I then asked if eating iron rich foods would help..... she said probably not; but since I am trying to eat healthful foods.... I am ensuring that I am getting good sources of iron. Dry skin - Lotion, lotion, lotion! Though I bought some brands that were recommended, I discovered they did have alcohol. Well, I've been using them and am not having a problem - but every time I put lotion on my hands after washing - I also do face, arms, and legs. With cold weather and warm house, relative humidity takes a beating!  Exercising - Though I have been good about walking 3 miles four to five days a week I've discovered that my upper body strength is rapidly decreasing. Anybody else noticing strength issues? I'm going to start an upper body workout now to my fitness routine. I am going to have to look up Zumba! Hormone therapy - I am scheduled to go on Femara.

Though my left foot still has some minor tingling and both have some swelling in the evening. (though the swelling may be residual from radiation? Now am to start Femara :-( Firni - I am now about 2 months from last chemo and I see hair growing, but it seems thin and still very short. My husband and daughter are giving me encouraging noises; I think they are being kind! Caroline - The dose dense does have specific criteria, but I have not heard about age restriction! I went thru dose dense and the biggest constraint in this area is the doctor being trained and the hospital having the correct equipment.  Lisa - No Zumba in our area. Sounds like fun, but I like others, am looking forward to better weather...... and getting back into bicycling! The feet issues have put my getting back into running on hold. Mary L ",

My hair is growing, I don't need a magnifying glass to see it anymore! It is about an 1/8 of an inch long. My eyebrows/eyelashes are still losing hair, but not gone. Even though I am on Femara I am beginning to feel normal. Got big fluffy snowflakes here today. Mary L ",
