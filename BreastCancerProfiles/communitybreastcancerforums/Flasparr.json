    "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 12:23PM - edited Jun 4, 2008 09:20PM by Flasparr I had the purple power port put in  Nov. 2007 for my chemo.  I had left lumpectomy earlier for stage IIB, triple negative IDC, BRCA 1+. I was always aware it was there, and bumping it somehow was always uncomfortable.  The port sits about 4 finger widths diagonally from the notch in the neck at your collarbone.  The catheter threads up into my right neck.  The vein holding the catheter has become very firm and stiff.  The whole set up, while never being one that I didn't know was there, has been tolerable until lately.  It is feeling tender, and like hairs getting pulled under my skin all the time where the port is.  I finished chemo in Feb. 2008, then did radiation for 6 weeks.  Now I'm getting the port removed (surgeon appt. today) so the ugly bump and the discomfort is gone.  I really think I am starting to reject the port or developing infection as I have episodes of joint pain, nausea, and general malaise for the last month as the port/catheter have become more tender.  My onc thinks it's \"all in my head\" and wants me to keep the thing in.  He did give me the referral back to my surgeon for removal, so he is supporting my wishes.  Guess the post removal tip culture, port culture, and condition of any fibrin formation will tell the tale.  Should I have recurrence of tumor in the future, I will have bilateral mastectomy and radiation, no chemo, so there is no reason to keep the port.  I am having bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy/hysterectomy 7/8/08 due to high risk ovarian CA due to BRCA status.  My veins are good enough that they can access OK for surgery without needing the port.  I have felt that I am in charge of what is done to my body from the start of this whole thing, and I don't want to keep a foreign body in me that I don't need any more.  It's tempting fate in my opinion, and that's the opinion most important. Bottom line:  the port for chemo is probably the most convenient way to go, but not the only way.  It isn't something that you forget about all the time.  If a medical professional tells you that, ask them if they've had one themselves to be able to say definitively.  I am one, and I've had one; and they aren't something to consider whimsically.",
