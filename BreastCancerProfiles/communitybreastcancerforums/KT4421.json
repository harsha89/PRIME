I had not had a mammogram for years. I went to the doctor and a biopsy was done and came back positive for breast cancer in my lymph node. They said it was HER2 - and hormone sensitive and moderately differentiated. I am seeing doctors on Tuesday but I am so afraid that since it wasn't found until my lymph node was swollen that it is more advanced than stage 2. I have been healthy and do not have any other symptoms. Has anyone had a similar experience? I know I should just relax and wait for my appointment where they will run more scans but I have so much anxiety. Log in to post a reply",
