When report of FNAC came it has fibroadenoma. Then he told for surgery of tumor. After surgery tumor sent for Biopsy. And when biopsy report shows that IDC in left breast. We went for further treatment in AIIMS Delhi. Again there have mammogram test, and Biopsy of tumor slide has happen. When report came it shows that there is malignant cell and doctor decide the stage is T0N1 and BIRADS 6 in left breast. And they suggest for Mastectomy. But when they went for Mastectomy they did not removed complete breast. And they told that they have removed some part from left breast & whole left axilla. And they sent some part of left axila for Biopsy. But the Biopsy report after surgery show that there is no any evidence found of malignant cell in the section examined. Now they have suggest for 6 cycle of chemotherapy. The reports lines of Biopsy after surgery are as bellow. Post surgery Biopsy Report: Benign Breast Prarenchyma with extensive suture, granuloma formation foreign body giant cell reaction with areas of old hemorrahge and aggregates of histiocytes and foci of fat nacrosis.
