I just started treatment (switched from Arimidex to Faslodex) 4 weeks ago. In addition to the hip pain at the injection site and \"flu-ish\" feeling, I am noticing the eye/temple pain you described. Yesterday was my third 500-mg treatment, and I am just wondering whether your symptoms still persist after being on this drug for 6 months. Thanks in advance for your reply!",

I am doing ok, but am sensing that the effectiveness of my current treatment (Navelbine + Herceptin) may be reaching the end of its useful life (6 months), since my tumor markers are starting to rise. How are you doing? By the way, I would like to send you the photos I took of you (of your shirt, actually). What is your email address? Mine is dorisann@dorisannprice.com.",
