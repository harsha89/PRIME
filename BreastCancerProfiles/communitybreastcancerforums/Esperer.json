I guess here in Canada we will be an unofficial trial for now. Vilma, I will get back to you soon with results, fingers crossed! Grannex thanks so much for your encouragement. Zarovka, I was reading through this thread and the bone mets thread, looking for information, and had a question. You mentioned that you were on Metformin at one point, and I was wondering why you chose to use this drug, (was there any concern of diabetes), and if it worked for you with regard to inflammation? Have you also decreased your sugar? And did this affect the progression of your mets?",

My family doc sends the reports via email and reviews this with me, and then I have an appointment with MO to discuss any changes. Two more weeks..... Thanks Lucia for sending the article, it sounds hopeful. I would much rather use my own immune system. Wendy/Grannex thanks for sharing and providing information on Txs that are working well. Will keep these in mind for future discussions with MO. Warm wishes to all,",

It's true that reality faces us every morning when we get up; keep planning and going on trips! I try to go away a few times every year, it helps. Remember that it took three scans before I had any progress on the femara. I was fairly stable before, but no shrinkage until the last scan. Give it time to work. Have a wonderful time away, and good luck in April!",

There are groups in some provinces that are starting to send petitions to government. I am from the eastern side of the country, NS, and have been waiting for over a year for it to be added. We need a national formulary in order to obtain these pricey drugs from big Pharma companies such as Pfizer. Fortunately, I have been doing well with Femara, which is blocking the estrogen; however, it does not shrink tumours even though they seem to remain stable. I have had two scans since starting Femara and all is good. However, I would like to see shrinkage or NED. My next scan is in a month and will let you know if there are any changes. Like you I very slight bone pain, although it has been a cold damp winter. Stick with it as long as it keeps working! PM me anytime if you want to talk more, take care! ",

I was wondering what Tx you are using now that your tumour has shrunk so much? JFL; thanks for the clarification and wow, that must have been a very difficult time for you, hope all is going well with your current Txs. Vilma; I would be most interested to hear the results of the trial as I was interested in metformin and why it works for some people but not all. Also, wondering if you are using CT scans in BC or another type of scanning for your checkups.",

Just finished catching up on posts and feel that I'm learning so much, thanks for passing along your wisdom! Hi Vilma, Just wanted to let you know that after CT scan and visit to MO there has been a 30% reduction in liver mets, and bone mets are barely visible on the scan. So I guess Femara rocks after all!! Such a relief to have shrinkage for once. There is word that Ibrance will soon be available but I think I will stick with just the hormone blocker for now. I know that you have scans coming up soon, and I hope that your results are positive as well! Take care, sending you hugs from the other side. Does anyone attend the MBC conferences; and if so are they helpful?",

I can see the benefits of attending either conference; however, you have confirmed my decision that the latter would be more helpful. I have actually found more helpful advice from all the incredible ladies on here than I have on podcasts from some of the research conferences. The research is important and leads to our Tx plans, and it is usually accessible either online or from our cancer centres. However, day to day, we have continued issues and concerns. MJH Thanks it is encouraging, and my first shrinkage! May the force be with you too! Miaomix Very helpful information, and good to know that you had a couple of years with leterozole! Zarovka I hope that you continue to improve now that you are home. Thanks for all the thoughtful postings regarding Tx, they help us all! The information that you provided from the Japanese doc that specializes in cancer metabolism was very practical and I love your action plan! What I'm getting from this is that we all should consider more balance in our lives. And to reconsider extreme diets and focus more on healthy intake. After researching the health effects of maintaining a high core body temp. back in the fall my DH and I decided to purchase a sauna for our own use. I feel so much better since my last scan in November, and it really helps the bones feel good. Whatever helps, right? Vilma Shout out to you, hope all is going well and you have seen the posts!",

Until now I haven't noticed anyone with the same diagnosis and treatment, you are the first. I am hoping that MO is using this Tx (femara only) as it seems to be keeping me stable for now. However, I am concerned that as Canadians we are unable to access Ibrance, which seems to be shrinking tumours for many on this board and across the US. How are you making out with the treatment? Has your MO discussed other Tx's with you?",
