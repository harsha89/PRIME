I freaked out when I saw the bloody discharge yesterday. The color of the discharge is thick, It refills up almost everyday when I squeeze it. I didn't squeeze my nipple for months to see if it will go away but it always was there when I squeeze it. I don't think it smells and after the white discharge,I get this watery clear discharge too.",
