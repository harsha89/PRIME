Then one week after starting A/C chemo I decided to shave it. We had a \"shaving party\" mostly because I wanted my kids to know I wasn't afraid to lose my hair. They were 14 and 16 at the time. They both participated in giving me a buzz cut before my cousin finished the job. Your scalp may tingle or feel sore as you start to lose the hair so don't let that frighten you. My eyebrows thinned out, but did not completely fall out. I lost my body hair, eyelashes and nose hair. Everything slowly started to grow in during my Taxol treatments. My eyelashes grew in and fell out for a few growth cycles. My hair grew back very thick and curly just like before treatment. Hang in there. It really feels like a marathon. You will look back and feel amazed at how you persevered",

Tewks, Don't worry, every woman I know who's lost their hair to chemo grows it back at different rates. One friend only took six weeks to go hat free, another friend six months. You'll get ther",

My hair was very long and curly prior to treatment. Now it's growing in straight and salt/pepper. Eyebrows and lashes came out 3 weeks after Abraxane, then grew back thick and healthy quickly. I would love to color it, but oncologist said wait. I only used coconut oil after showering.",

Met with breast surgeon for normal visit, and she wants a routine breast MRI. Is this normal? She said she likes follow up images post treatment. The anxiety I'm feeling just thinking about it is making me crazy. I'm actually terrified that there might be something she isn't telling me. I felt such relief after the clear mammo, now this is getting me in knots again.
