We are 5 hours from Denver and 5 hours from Salt Lake City. I am taking this very seriously, but I want to have confidence in my local doctors. My husband and I discussed going to a different city for treatment if things take a weird turn, but maybe that\u2019s how we should approach the entire situation. My meeting with the surgeon was with a general surgeon. We do not have breast surgeons, but your post has me thinking to do more research on doctors! We have four surgeons in town, but two are out of town. I\u2019m not sure for how long. Breast surgery was one of this surgeons specialties on their website. I am definitely going to take your advice to have the biopsy retested or another core biopsy. I never thought to ask! I think I also need another visit with the surgeon. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I appreciate your comments on this topic!! I\u2019m sending positive thoughts your way!",

Minutes later, it was suggested I have a core needle biopsy immediately. Within minutes I was prepped and had the biopsy. While it was nice to have everything done so quickly, it has my mind reeling- and no one would tell me why this is such an emergency. The radiologist only said the mass was \"concerning\". Results came back from everything (below) and it was determined I needed to meet with a surgeon to have the mass removed completely. Ultra Sound results: large, ill defined mass centrally within the breast, extending slightly lateral in the sub areolar distribution measuring 3.2 x 2.1 cm. This is concerning for malignancy. Mammogram results: bi rad 4, extremely dense breast tissue (I am 30). Obscured large mass like density, ill defined mass. Biopsy results: clinical breast mass, fibrosis with chronic mastitis, negative for identifiable malignancy. I met with a surgeon two weeks later and he really tried everything to come up with a reason to not do surgery. He doesn't understand how different each result is. He said if it was mastitis, the mass would hurt. It does not. He said it is very rare for a 30 year old who has never been pregnant or breastfed to have mastitis. He determined the mass needs to be removed sooner rather than later. I am scheduled for Feb 7 for the lumpectomy, but his office will call if there is a cancelation. They tried to get me in the next week, but the hospital is booked. The surgeon gave me a lot more information and answered my questions honestly. He went over next steps if the tumor is cancer. When I asked why he thinks the mass is cancer, he told me he doesn't think it is cancer because I am 30. The only reason he doesn't think it is cancer is because I am 30. Should I be extremely concerned? Only family history is my paternal grandmother had breast cancer. My friends and family all say it is benign and not to worry. I consider myself to be extremely rational and know I need to wait until the lumpectomy results, but my heart just needs some guidance. Thank you, friends! Log in to post a reply",
