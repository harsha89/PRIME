My triple neg, rare bc needs wide margins it's the only thing proven to prevent recurrence. My surgeon (different one the second time around) said 1 cm was considered a wide margin.

I had a lumpectomy in Dec and reexcision for better margins in Jan. The reexcision showed one focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. The rt breast also has ductal hyperplasia and a fibroadenoma dx per u/s back in Nov. In the back of my mind I have been worried about the rt. breast but the docs don't seem to be. I've never had an MRI. Should I be more questioning this with the docs?",
