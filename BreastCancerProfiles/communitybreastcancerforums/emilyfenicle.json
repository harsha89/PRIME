    "Content": "emilyfenicle wrote: I need some guidance! I am 36 with a maternal side history of breast cancer (my grandmother & her 5 sisters all had bc & my cousin on that side died at 30 from IBC). I found a hard round lump about 3 months ago. Had a mammogram & ultrasound which verified lump at 5 mm and another area 3 mm. They just wanted me to follow up for repeat in 6 months and I insisted on biopsy. The results showed the larger lump had \"chronic inflammation\" - Dr stated it was more than likely an injury. I can't recall any injury. The 3 mm was a cyst that they drained and broke up during the biopsy.  I have been looking everywhere for more info on what chronic inflammation would mean or if it will disappear.  Does anyone have any insight? I sti have to do repeat in 6 month unless something changes.  Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
