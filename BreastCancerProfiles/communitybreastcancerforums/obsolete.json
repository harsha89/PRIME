My heart feels for you that you fear any potential women's health issues with your dear Mom. What you're feeling & facing is normal, sweetie. Fearing the unknown is both frightening and natural. Losing a parent is so very difficult at any age, but at your young age it's harder on the soul to suffer loss. I feel your pain. I also had lost my mom at a young age to a sudden stroke... but she didn't suffer. Your mom has a common benign abnormal finding, per your subject. Your Mom's situation is apparently being closely monitored for any changes, so you need not worry about your dear Mom. How wonderfully blessed your Mom is to have a loving, caring compassionate son as you!! Sending you lots of big bear cyber {{{ hugs }}}",

You are invited to the PAPILLARY CARCINOMA thread, where there is a wealth of information & links to articles & studies on papillary lesions. Perhaps you might consider having a MRI in the interim period. Please keep in mind that peripheral type papillary tumors can present in multiples, but centrally located papillary tumors \"usually\" do not. Any papillary lesions 5mm & under are often NOT visible on MRI. Additionally, needling procedures are NOT encouraged for patients with papillary lesions. Mel, your planned \"excissional\" biopsy is the best biopsy method recommended for papillary tumors per medical studies. It's important to obtain 2nd opinions from dedicated breast pathologists on your forthcoming pathology slides. The waiting & wondering is a royal pain, but it gives the patient more time for research & advocacy. Best wishes!",
