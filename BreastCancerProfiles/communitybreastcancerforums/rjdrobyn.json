I really appreciate all the information that you have shared. I have had 5 rounds of Halaven and have experienced much of the same side effects that each of you have discussed. Nueropathy, nausea and fatigue have been the side effects that love to knock me down. I have been on 5 different chemos since late 2011. I thought the extraordinary fatigue was from all the previous chemos so it is good to know that Halaven has had some impact on my tiredness. I will finally get scans on November 12 and learn of the results on November 14. If Halaven hasn't made any headway with the cancer, my onc feels that the cancer is now resistant to the types of chemos that are available. Even though I knew that this would most likely happen at some point, I did find it hard to hear. I have been Stage IV out the gate for 15 years. I know I have had a good run but I'm not ready to stop fighting. I am saying this on a day that I have felt fairly good. There are days when I am so tired I do not want to move and I think what kind of life is this. I never say those words to anyone but it feels cathartic to type them. Is anyone doing any complimentary treatments such as Reiki, energy balancing, accupuncture etc.? I was trying Reiki but honestly, the fatigue just makes it so hard for me to go anywhere.  I was also not really feeling much of anything and the cost was bothering me. Let me know if anyone is doing anything that makes them feel better. Thank you for letting me vent. I pray that all of you will get a miracle.",

I have been reading many of the posts in this forum and others and the most I have seen is 12. I am on treatment 18 and I feel awful. I keep pumping myself up as best I can but all I do is go to work, get treatment and sleep. I am trying to judge if I am just giving in too easily.

I really appreciate all your entries talking about how you are handling your treatments. I am getting a weekly push of Navelbine and tomorrow is #3. For now, I am scheduled to get this drug weekly with no break but I am sure that all depends on my ability to keep my white and red counts high enough. I am working full time but WOW am I exhausted. I have yet to get out of the house this weekend. I also have trouble breathing and find myself short of breath just taking the laundry to the basement. It is all tolerable but I wish I wasn't so depleted of energy.",

Get up, sit on the edge of the bed until I can stand up, feed the dogs, sit for a couple minutes to stabilize the nausea, get dressed and sit in between the process. I even had to rest when I was in the shower, which was actually kind of funny. I am getting to work later and later. I have points in the day when I feel okay but that can change as quickly as Ohio weather can change. How is everyone else dealing with work and navelbine? Have you found a way to minimize some of these side effects? I feel as many of you do that I am willing to handle many things if the drug is working. But if anyone has any tips or tricks on how to minimize the challenges, I would really appreciate your thoughts. Thanks to all of you brave and wonderful people.",

It also worked for a while so I completely understand the concept of a \"favorite\" chemo. I do have a question about your rebound while on Navelbine. Did your rebound really just happen or did your dosage get adjusted? Can you remember when the rebound occurred? For example, did it happen after the 4th treatment or something like that? Thanks for the info.",

Did any of you that endured 18 or 24 rounds of Taxol deal with continued pain and neuropathy after you stopped taking the Taxol? Some of the posts that I have read on other sites mention severe issues after Taxol treatment.",
