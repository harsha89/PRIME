Following that I had a digital mammogram and two MRI's that did not show any primary tumor in the breast.  I also had a bone scan, PET/CT scan that were clear.  I have been officially diagnosed with occult breast cancer which occurs in less than 5% of cancer patients. They know that the lump originated in the breast based on the characteristics (i.e. ER+, HER 2-) but they can't see the main tumor site. I am undergoing 6 TAC chemo treatments since the cancer had obviously spread to the lymph nodes.  I will then have a full axilliary dissection and radiation.  I am still unsure what to do about the breast.  Both my oncologist and surgeon do not recommend a mastectomy in my case.  They say there is no evidence that shows it will be any more effective than what we are doing already.  Dr. Love also says in her book that mastectomy is not necessarily needed in these cases.  I haven't decided what I want to do, but I will finish my chemo in March and will have to make that decision soon.\" Beth ",
