You are in the right place, ask all the questions you need of us and of your doctors.  Information is power.  No question is stupid.  I know I didn't know the first thing about breast cancer until I started my journey.  By no means am I an expert and I'm still learning and still asking!",

I have been traveling 4 hours (one way) to Boston from Maine for treatment.  We decided that I should have the chemo done in Maine - I am waiting for the Boston oncologist to set me up with an oncologist in Maine so that I can begin treatment most likely in 2 weeks. Is it normal to wake up at 4 am and be so anxious my heart just races?  (I take something for anxiety to fall asleep - only since being diagnosed or I would never fall asleep).  I hope I can get through chemo, it just seems so long.  Just the thought of getting the port inserted and all the scans and tests I need to do prior to starting chemo have me exhausted, how am I going to feel once it actually starts....  Up until June 30th I was such a strong woman.  I'm VP of a large manufacturing company, involved in the community and outgoing - so in control and very confident,  now I don't even know who I am.  I don't want to get out of bed and all I think about is going to bed and escaping. I feel bad for my 3 sons, that I don't have the energy I once did only 2 months ago. I'm tired of everyone telling me I'm strong and you'll get through this, your hair will grow back, etc. I'm scared and weak that's the truth. I'm sorry to dump, but I don't know who to talk to or where to turn.",

Because the tiny traces were found chemo is on tap.  Her2 has not been determined yet.  I am beyond scared of chemo.  Surgery didn't scare me, I'm ready to jump off a bridge because of chemo....I wish someone could help me.  I have never felt so desperate.  I will be meeting with my oncologist on Monday as well as my surgeon to discuss treatment.  Do I really need chemo if they got the tumor out with clean margins and the node only has minimal traces????",
