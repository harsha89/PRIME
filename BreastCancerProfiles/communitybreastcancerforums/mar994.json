When the pain didn't go away, I thought I'd better go in for my mammogram. I didn't get my mammogram last spring. Well, I got a phone call this morning. They want me to come in for a diagnostic mammogram on my right breast. I'm scared to death that it's going to be cancer. I'm unemployed and looking for work, hence no insurance. My husband was unemployed for a while and just now went back to work. But his job doesn't offer insurance. I'm trying not to fall apart and know I shouldn't worry just yet. But, based on the pain I've been having, I'm fearing the worst. Log in to post a reply",
