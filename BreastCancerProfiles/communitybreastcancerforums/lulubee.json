Some of us Taxol metsters are trying to rustle up some new activity on the \"Weekly Taxol for Stage IV\" thread. You should add it to your favorites, too. Can't hurt to have more camaraderie, right? I've never worn a wig before so I'm really dreading it. I have a large head (I can never, ever wear women's hats) so I had to insist on trying only the wigs that came in large. I could seriously tell a difference when the gal plopped an average size wig on my head-- yowzer, so uncomfortable. So maybe you could try a large wig and see if that's better for you. Hard to tell whether I'm having side effects from Taxol because I have a lot of other challenges going on right now while I'm getting started on it. I was just released from a weeklong stay in the hospital because I developed a malignant pericardial effusion that dang near took me down. Had a catheter surgically inserted, drained off a big jug of junk, and now I'm trying to regain my ability to breathe on my own-- the pressure from the effusion caused some lung collapse and also caused some pleural effusion from the inflammation. I've been on oxygen for over two weeks now. So if I have side effects from Taxol, who could tell? LOL Right now tonight I'm navigating the lovely steroid crash from Thursday's infusion. Ay ay ay ay ay. I really hate steroids. Do you get them with Abraxane?",

Since the two drugs are essentially the same except for a solvent in Taxol that is not in Abraxane, I think I will tag along with you here if that's okay. I'm watching my hair like a hawk. It's my one major vanity. I'll be honest, I have really good, thick hair with lots of body, and it is kind of my trademark, you know? I bought a wig last weekend and a couple of cute caps, and I have a lifelong collection of beautiful scarves, so at least I feel prepared now. That does help. Maybe go wig shopping with a friend, if you can? Get your onc to write a script for it. I took my young, stylish adult daughters and let them pick out the right wig for me-- they know what looks good on me. We can't change what is going to happen anyway, and probably soon. But you might be surprised how much better you feel about things with a pretty long wig on standby.",

I had a hyst/oophorectomy the next week, which turned up yet another surprise: a sprinkling of mets around my right ovary. The bright side is that those cells gave us something to run through pathology without digging into bone. Sure enough, still ER+PR+Her2-. As you can see in my status section below, I had a fairly good run on AI's. Femara 1.5 years, Faslodex 5 months, Afinitor+Aromasin 1.5 years.

I'm just thankful to have energy whenever it decides to come! ",

That is one kind of QOL. But if having a bit of something completely awesome will make me feel alive, festive and satisfied, have Jeeves bring it to me on a silver platter post haste!  Haha!  That's another kind of QOL.  Balance, balance, balance. I just do the best I can, day in and day out, and then let myself indulge on those days when festivity beckons or whenever it just makes me feel like I'm still living a great life.  There are days when a warm chocolate chip cookie is all it takes to make me feel like I'm still viably connected to all the good things still left for me in this world.  But I don't eat a half-dozen of them while baking them like I used to... and I for sure don't eat them often. Since BC, I have become much choosier about my indulgences.  If I'm going to eat something out of the ordinary, it has to be EXTRAordinary.  A small portion of something fabulous -- hearty gourmet cheese, good dark chocolate, a bold cabernet, a homemade cobbler -- satisfies me better than a plateful of blah cheddar, Snickers, Chips-A-Hoy, soft drinks... and so on.  (However, I do love me some Cheetos now and then!) One cup of great coffee is like a tonic for me, so I have it... and chase it with a tumbler of water. I almost never eat processed foods nor anything with a long, complicated ingredient label.  I buy organic as much as I can but I don't get in a twist about it.  When I was a child I used to gather fresh eggs from our chickens every morning for breakfast-- warm brown eggs with rich, creamy, bright orange yolks-- and to this day I cannot abide pale, watery, gross factory eggs.  So I do splurge on the best eggs I can find-- pastured, soy-free, organic eggs from a smaller local farm.  I also buy organic lactose-free milk.  I try to make my own salad dressings, baked goods, and ice cream (and tweak the recipes to make them a bit healthier) so I know exactly what my cells are feeding on. By food journalling, I identified foods that always make a very noticeable difference in the way I look and feel, and I try to make them the cornerstones of my diet.  For me, they are: wild salmon, dark greens, blueberries, raw oysters, apples, wheatgrass juice, free-range turkey, almonds, walnuts, garlic, and lentils.  To a lesser degree but still noticeable: kraut, sweet potatoes, Greek yogurt, eggs, ginger, chili peppers, cinnamon, green tea, olive oil, goat cheeses, and dark British ale (like Bass, Guinness, Belhaven and Newcastle).  Once a month, when I get a beef craving, my DH and I go out for a top-shelf gourmet cheeseburger-- good grass-fed sirloin topped with sharp cheddar-- and french fries made from fresh, unfrozen potatoes.  These days I wash it down with a cold Shiner Bock, which I've finally figured out is way healthier for me than Dr Pepper or Diet Coke.  I really look forward to our monthly burgerfest.  I can just feel those B-vitamins washing over my nervous system afterward... ahhh. I eat a half-dozen raw oysters once or twice a month because after 5 1/2 years in this BC game I am totally convinced it boosts my blood counts and it helps these awful skin sores from Afinitor heal faster.  By now, even my onc believes me!   Wheatgrass juice and green drinks are the real deal. I have resolved to juice and blend more this year. Last year I mostly only juiced after my monthly Xgeva injection, before and after blood draws, and immediately after scans.  Anytime I get a shot of wheatgrass juice, I get a beautiful burst of energy that makes me feel young and productive again (and oh how I miss that feeling!), so one of my New Year's projects is to get set up to grow my own wheatgrass so I can have a shot most every day.   I've rambled on too long, woops.  I'm enjoying reading everyone's responses to this thread!",

I will never know if the bone mets three years later were also heralded by fatigue because they were diagnosed about a month after my 18yo daughter almost died from mycoplasma pneumonia.  The two of us were in isolation in ICU almost a thousand miles from home for seven days, during which I existed on adrenaline, coffee, and prayer.

Please forgive me if you see this cross-posted on the Abemaciclib Verzenio thread. I just got news of progression and my onc has given me a choice of Halaven OR Abemaciclib + Arimidex. Any thoughts? Pros and cons? As you can see from my epic bio below, this is my 6th progression in 8 years at Stage IV. I got 20 months out of weekly Taxol. Not easy-- it snatched me bald, wore me out, and jacked up my feet and fingertips--but it did the job for a good while and I am thankful for that. My onc first mentioned Halaven, but it would be nice to walk away from the chemo chair for a bit, and also Abemaciclib would give my hands and feet a chance to recover. But then... another AI... groan. How I hate those things. I've had all of them except this next one, Arimidex. After 8 years, I think I would commit a felony for a jigger of estrogen. Any thoughts on the side effect profiles, Halaven vs. Abema? Thanks for any insights.",

Either you have eaten beets, or that is red blood cells, and that is your bladder sending up a red flag (literally). You need to get a UA done ASAP. As cancer patients, we can get infections, go septic, and things can turn ugly FAST. Don't mess around with bad bacteria because it can always mess around with you more. It's easier to pee in a cup and take a round of antibiotics than to wind up in the hospital for 2 weeks from sepsis. As for me, I've been on treatment nonstop for 8 years and my bladder is fried. It burns *badly* for a couple days every week and urinating is painful. It's painful enough that I always have to take pain meds and AZO to function when it flares. This has been going on for 7 months and I've been referred to see a urologist to make sure it's not my lobular MBC showing up in my bladder membrane. (Oh great, right? At least that's really rare... but then again so are biliary duct mets and pericardial mets, and those are my specialty.) I've had multiple UA tests over the last 8 months and they are all negative-- meaning it's never bacteria for me, it's just bad cystitis type inflammation. I am slowly adapting my habits to protect my bladder better. Basically more hydration, triple IV fluids with infusion, alkalizing powder in my water, never drinking acidic drinks without flooding my system with a big glass of water first, fewer acidic foods, digestive enzymes, dried aloe vera capsules, magnesium oxide, monitoring what I've ingested before a really bad flare, etc. It's all a pain in the tail, and I mean that literally.",

I think I left off chronicling with the evening of Day 3 after the first injection, when I suddenly got hit by the painpalooza truck. Yeah. Whew. That was pretty bad, and vicoprofen didn't faze it. Just made me care a little less but the pain was definitely still happening. Flu-like aches coupled with bones on fire. I tried the lidoderm patches that I keep around for bone mets pain. Not much help. So after a while I took off the patches and tried taking a nap on my biomat. The heat seemed to help. I for sure kept my feet and hands off of the warm mat, though. Susan, you say you had a spell of doubting your reason for living... well, that's interesting because I definitely had a wave of low mood mid-week, just a day of feeling unusually despondent and discouraged. I reminded myself that other TX have had this effect on me at times and it would pass-- and it did. I'll be looking out for that this week and I have written notes to myself in case it recurs... \"go rest, watch something stupid like Monty Python, call a friend, FaceTime the grandbairns...\" I turned a corner on Friday which was Day 5, and the weekend was okay. Pretty tired as per usual, and I notice that I can't eat much at a time without it trying to come back up a little, but otherwise things were fairly okay. My taste buds are still a little flat, I think. So today I got slapped with a neupogen auto-injector pod thingy on my tummy. I feel rather like the Bionic Woman from the 70's TV show. I can take it off tomorrow night after it pumps the rocket juice into my belly at hour 27. I'm to take Claritin for three nights. Apparently the orders on file are for me to get one of these fancy pods with every injection. Susan, do you get these? Maybe you need a boost of WBC??

The ovary is long gone, the destroyed common bile duct was surgically restored somehow and has a 5-year-old large mesh metal stent in it, and the heart mets were whipped into submission by pericardiocentesis surgery and Taxol. Such fun, LOL. Onward we go. Hang in there, Pajim!",

You know how tired I am of icing after 20 months, and I am seriously done with steroids and Benadryl. UGH. I think I am leaning toward Halaven now which surprises me because I was leaning hard toward Verzenio last week when I first got the progression news. But I've done treatments every which way by now-- daily oral meds with no break ever, oral meds pulsed every other week, meds injected once a month (faslodex), and now 20 months of weekly IV chemo with one week off per month. Bottom line for me: even though I loathe having the trip to the hospital on my calendar every week and certainly don't love being bald, I think overall I hold up better mentally when I know I have a week off to look forward to. Plus I always turn into a stiff 90-year-old crone when I am on an AI, and my onc wants to pair one with Verzenio. So there's that. So... here we go. I guess maybe I'm joining you gals here on the Halaven crew come Monday?",

I had CTs every 8 weeks when I was on study with Taxol. The radiology guys explained to me that the barium works by coating everything in its path so it is kind of like a bulldozer in the gut; whatever is in there already, it will push it forward with force. So I've learned to clear the runway a bit before the barium lands-- I cut back on gas-forming foods and try to clear my GI tract the day before. That does help. I've had my port for 5.5 years, and one time a couple of years ago it wouldn't give blood return and I had to have enzymes. It's worked fine every time since then (it's accessed at least once a week). I hope that will encourage you that this might be a one-time thing. Maybe the same conditions that enabled the clot to form also contributed to the clogged port? Thicker blood, maybe. I don't know why I have never had to do those shots but I am glad I've missed that ring in this circus, so far anyway. Because of my MTHFR mutation, I've had a ton of clots throughout my life though never in my lungs. That is a bother, for sure. I'm sorry you have to mess with that. Did they tell you to take baby aspirin? I've had a wretched week following Halaven #2 with Neulasta. Good heavens. You said the first round made you question your will to live and I am just about THERE. This *has* to get better. I've had a headache from hades for six days and I still feel like I have the flu. And golly, I have SO much to do and it's all just piling higher while I slog around. If I take a pain med that even fazes the aches and pains, I get sleepy and cannot be productive.

I've been on all the treatments in your list except for Doxil, if you count your Abraxane as equivalent to my Taxol. My neuropathy budded with Taxol but has bloomed with Halaven. With Taxol, it was mostly concentrated in my fingertips, toes, and foot pads. With Halaven, it has rather quickly spread over larger areas. After my 5th cycle, it had ascended above my knees and taken over my hands entirely. My back/flank area was beginning to feel tingly, too. My MO wanted to see if it was developing into permanent neuropathy, so I was given a two-week break in early December. Toward the end of that break, I finally began to experience improvement-- I have recovered a good bit of feeling in my knees and shins again, though not 100%, and I am not dropping knives and such. I resumed treatment last week at a 20% dose reduction. Praying I can hang in there because all in all, Halaven has proven more tolerable for me than several treatments I've had (other than the not-small issue of losing feeling all over my body). I am not sure what really helps, but after trying a variety of things, here are the 5 things I continue to do routinely: 1. I have continued the icing I did on Taxol but I think I need to start 30 minutes earlier than I have been, and then also leave the mitts and socks on longer after the push. 2. I cannot take Gabapentin which is sometimes scripted for neuropathy so my MO agreed to me taking GABA Calm (a supplement) instead. I take 2-3 lozenges nightly (it helps with sleep and anxiety, too), and I take a couple on chemo mornings also. 3. My MO told me to take a B complex supplement daily and then take extra B6 twice a day on top of that. 4. I go through lots of Penetrex cream, which is popular with diabetes neuropathy patients. It does seem to help. 5. I avoid hot baths for a couple of days after treatment. What I'm going to try next: For Christmas, I was given a TENS unit for feet and also one of those nubby foot roller gizmos for neuropathy. I am also going to pull out my rebounder as soon as the Christmas tree is down-- I figure my lymph system needs it even if it doesn't help my feet. I am considering buying a Cubii desk elliptical (Amazon) to pedal while I work at my desk. Hoping these things will increase circulation and sensation in my feet. As for exercise, I would advise avoiding anything that puts pressure on the hands and feet for 2-3 days after treatment. Also be conscious of your knees and quads buckling on you-- several of us have experienced weirdly collapsing knees (like when stepping off curbs or using stairs) and moments of surprising weakness in the large leg muscles. All the best to you. I hope Halaven does you right for a long, long time.",

The malate form of magnesium is commonly recommended for people with fibromyalgia and muscle pain, so I figured it was worth a try. The malate form can increase energy so it's best to take it early in the day, whereas the other forms of magnesium help with sleep. It does maybe seem to be helping.

Here's hoping your WBC will play nice with you without that extra drug. I've had a rough patch and haven't been posting as much because I can barely type. On 10/13, I had a terrible triple-impact fall and had to spend a hard night in ER. Thankfully nothing fractured, which is a miracle considering I have mets in almost every bone, but I do have serious radial nerve damage in my left shoulder down to the fingers (which still feel almost dead, and I don't have much use of that arm), several rib contusions, lots of deep, deep bruises from head to toe. I am in physical therapy for a while to try to regain use of, well, everything. Like cancer is not enough hell, y'all. Oh no, I gotta be an overachiever and find ways to suffer even MORE. LOL. But Seriously. I was on my patio when a wasp stung my finger. I flicked it off but then heard the hum of more wasps headed my way. Fight-or-flight kicked in-- and I have now learned the hard way that primal instincts do not stop to remember you have neuropathy. So my legs started to run toward the back door, but my feet totally failed to keep up. This launched me into a double plate-glass patio door, face and shoulder first. Then I ricocheted into a brick wall on my right (ear, skull, other shoulder), then I crashed hard onto concrete on my kneecap, big toe, and elbow. So yeah, I looked like I'd been in an alley gang fight or a terrible car wreck. Black and blue everywhere. I'm healing slowly, but it is getting better. My tumor markers were steady after the first cycle of Halaven, whereas they had been climbing a bit every month before, so that is good but not good enough to pop a champagne cork over... and it meant we needed to go ahead with treatment a few days after the accident. Hell, I tell you. I've finished two cycles and now begins a much-needed week off. Praying big for a drop in markers on this Friday's labs. One thing... the first Neulasta On-body or whatever they call that beeping belly pod thingy... almost wrecked my will to live. So this past week I lobbied for a half-dose, a 3mg injection in the belly the day after chemo. MO agreed to try that, and so far it has worked a whole lot better for me. Nowhere near the bone agony as the belly rocket pod dose. ",

During that time, the pericardial mets went berserk and I wound up in ER with almost a liter of malignant fluid crammed into a little sac designed to hold an ounce or two of fluid. I had to have an emergency pericardiocentesis, and I had considerable lung damage from it and had to have 24/7 oxygen support for almost two months. I did recover, slowly.

These instructions are aimed at healthy people, not lymphatically challenged people like those of us in the BC population, and this makes a big difference. It is critical that those of us with impaired lymph systems get our instructions from lymphedema specialists. (Not to be confused with Gwyneth Paltrow, LOL.) Every one of these videos and how-to's for dry brushing that I have seen online instructs you to start at your feet and stroke up the legs, then go to the fingertips and stroke up the arms, and end with your chest. I had ten sessions with a lymphatic massage specialist at the hospital after my BMX, and she was emphatic that people with lymphedema risk should never do this. If your neck and chest area are congested with lymph fluid, there is nowhere for the incoming fluid (from your extremities) to go, and you will just tax the lymph system further. Therefore, we start by stroking from the ear to the sternum, and then from the armpit to the center of the torso. Once those pathways are cleared out, then you can stroke arm fluids to drain into them. (Even here, I work in short increments, starting at the shoulder, then going up from the elbow, then up from the fingertips.) Here is a picture tutorial for correct lymphatic massage for those of us who are at risk. ",

I've never had full-blown lymphedema but over the past eleven years since my BMX I have learned there are boundaries I have to respect to keep from setting myself up for nonreversible problems. Like-- I wear a compression sleeve on flights, keep my left arm out of hot bath water, never sleep on that side, don't overexert or lift heavy things with that arm, never clap vigorously, etc. When I do, I feel the heaviness creeping in just enough to keep me on my toes. All that to say... a while back I bought an expensive biomat with the intent to heat up my mets areas-- spine and hip bones, etc. Even though I was careful to keep my arms off the mat, I quickly discovered that even 15-20 minutes on the mat can make them grow alarmingly heavy, sluggish, and achy-- worse than anything else I've ever done!

This lobular stuff is sneaky, isn't it?

We logged in another 1.6 mile walk this evening. Heart seemed every-so-slightly less trigger happy tonight. And for my closet cardio, I threw a few things away and then decided to just focus for today on organizing and editing my shoes. One thing at a time is about all I can handle.

So daughter will be over the moon with the bag of super cute shoes coming her way, and I now have shelf room for all the incoming wig paraphernalia.

Reason being, if you get into a situation where you need that relationship, it very likely will be a Right This Minute situation. I had a thread here at the time where I posted a bit about the experience. I think this is it: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/... And I posted on this thread about it in November. Search for \"gallbladder armageddon\" and it will be the only post that comes up in the results. It's good that you're keeping an eye on your bilirubin. Watch how your body reacts to lean vs fatty foods. That should be a clue. When my gallbladder is touchy, I get away with nothing. Soon after my first stent was placed, I triggered a horrific pain attack with two grilled shrimp. (I can eat meat now with no issues.) I've only had two bad, all-nighter gallbladder attacks in the past four years, and both were triggered by barbecue. No more barbecue for me! I'm a Texan, so this is tragic.

And like clockwork, on my monthly week off, I have six big raw oysters slathered with a fresh horseradish-heavy cocktail sauce and a big squeeze of lemon, all washed down with a dark Shiner Bock-- with my MO's blessing, believe it or not. I can just feel that zinc bath wash over all my beleaguered cells. I don't eat much animal protein on the daily, though. I try to eat a few ounces of wild salmon once every week or two because ugh, our poor wilting brains on all this stuff we take! Besides, salmon makes you pretty. The one thing I do every single blooming day, just for my deeply insulted liver and gallbladder: I wake up, stumble into the kitchen, juice a big lemon and drink it like a shot, followed by a big glass of filtered water. I do not start my day until I've downed that lemon juice. I envision it flushing out my biliary tree with a huge swooshing sound. When I forget my morning lemon moment, I feel it. I second Z on the Milk Thistle. It's amazing stuff and I take it on a pulsed basis (which actually just means I forget a lot of the time, but \"pulsed\" sounds more trendy and intentional so let's go with that). I once took an herbalist course, way back in another epoch of life, where I was taught that MT is the only substance known to prompt liver regeneration in cirrhosis, and that in Germany it is prescribed by doctors for that purpose. Worth a shot, I say.",

I wanted to let you know that I have had three ERCP common bile duct stent procedures like you just had, plus an EUS. That was exactly four years ago. Recovery took a while and I had to be diligent and careful, but I have done well. If there's any way I can help, please feel free to PM me. I've been all around the arena on this bucking bronco. I'm so glad you got help and are improving! This is scary stuff when it gets out of hand, which mine definitely did. In short: super sneaky lobular BC mets snuck into my common bile duct and set up camp, and all hell broke loose. I should have gone to a gastroenterologist or to ER earlier than I did. My duct was found \"glued shut, wide and occluded, and full of strictures\" and my gallbladder was distended and full of sludge.The bile duct mets set off a 5cm mass of inflammation at the head of my pancreas, and pancreatitis set in. Then my liver failed several times in a three month window. That was a lost fall/winter I would like to have back. I was in the hospital a lot that winter with liver enzymes out the roof, and I went six weeks without eating a meal. Urine was the color of a basketball, stool the color of light clay, and of course my skin was yellow. The fourth and final surgery was an emergency. When the surgeon pulled out the stent he had put in a couple of weeks earlier (the first two stents were plastic and they clogged up quickly), he said infection spewed everywhere-- but thankfully he was already in there with the scope so he was able to quickly suck it all out and clean everything up. He then inserted a large mesh metal stent which can expand a bit. That procedure saved my life. I came so close to dying that time that I was aware of my thinking processes fading in the hours right before I was taken to the hospital. But things quickly turned around with the big stent and armageddon-grade IV antibiotics that dripped in my port over the next week while I binge-watched Downton Abbey in my hospital bed and sipped broth. (I learned that if you watch DA, you will get a LOT more attention from the nurses because they want to find excuses to hang out in your room!! True story.) That's the scary part; here's the good part. I have now had that mesh metal stent for three years past its projected efficacy window! Usually they have to be replaced after a year or so. But my monthly liver panels are still normal, so we are leaving well enough alone until symptoms start up again. I still have my gallbladder, which is amazing. I have had a few random gallbladder attacks (maybe one per year; we think there's an occasional stone banging up against the stent till it breaks down enough to pass, and that is the cause of those pain flares), but I have been able to remediate and (I think) even prevent boomerang flares on my own. I keep a kit of supports for gallbladder and liver, for when I sense my biliary tree is getting sluggish and needs a helping hand. I am fully recovered from the chronic pancreatitis, which still feels like a miracle! So chin up. Take care of yourself and I think you will do just fine. BRAVA to you for going to ER. The biliary tree is nothing to mess with. Mess with it, and it will mess with you! PM me if you have questions or anything. I know I sure did.",

I took Xeloda for three years for widespread bone mets. For me, Xeloda worked fast and very well-- I was NEAD for almost three years on it, the longest PFS I've had on any line of treatment yet. Also, like you, I felt it during my off-weeks at first, kind of like it accumulated during the on-weeks and then got to work the following week when it had reached full saturation. In the months before I reached NEAD on it, it made my bone mets ache like mad during my off-weeks. Obviously, it was tumor flare (die-off) pain. I'm hoping that's what you're feeling in your liver and that you have a string of good checkups ahead. All the best to you.",

I would say that I do not mean to scare you, but maybe I do just a little, out of love. Do not hesitate to go to ER if your pain levels escalate. Or if your color changes, if your pee turns dark, or your stools turn clay colored and start to float. Listen to your body. By the time I got to ER, I was starting to experience loss of mentation. I can always tell a nurse what I need, rather infamously, you know? But when we got to the hospital, I was saying fuzzy not-at-all-me stuff like, \"Whatever you think, I don't know, you decide\" and thinking it would not be so awful to just close my eyes and float away to heaven.

I love the thing so much and I forget it's in there. It is sometimes accessed three times in one week and I have never had any problems with infection. As for using it for complementary pursuits outside the world of nurses who are trained to access ports... that would give me pause, personally. I almost never let anyone but my oncology nurses touch the thing. I've had ER nurses try to bluff me that they knew how to access a port, and then prove that they did not. I've had ER nurses refuse to use it and insist on sticking a vein against my protests, only to have zero blood return (serves 'em right, LOL!) and another bout of phlebitis. I won't do that to myself again if I can avoid it, so my workaround-- and it works just fine!-- is whenever I have a surgery or a scan scheduled for early in the morning, I go see my oncology nurse at clinic closing time the evening before to get it accessed. She knows how to bandage it up for overnight and that is not uncomfortable, in the grand scheme of things. It's worth it to me. So if you know now where you will be going for anything that would use a port, I'd say call now or show up and ask questions. How often do they access ports, do they flush them with Heparin, is there always a nurse present who can do it... and get the full names of the nurses who are known to be adept.

I wake up sometimes with sore temples, neck, cheekbones. Botox in the jaw area has been recommended. Eeeks. More toxins??

I read earlier this week that the list of meds that interact with grapefruit is actually quite a bit more extensive than what is commonly reported. For example, I have never been warned at the clinic to avoid grapefruit on Taxol. However, I have found Taxol on lists of contraindicated meds online.

Vicoden doesn't help me much at all.  The hydrocodone meds take about an hour to take effect, so if I need something to take the edge off faster I also take a couple teaspoons of children's liquid Advil at the same time.  It's miraculous stuff -- works faster than the usual gelcaps.

My lobular mets do not always read clearly on a CT scan (and fwiw 11 years ago they did not show up on mammography either, meaning NOT AT ALL). My last six CTs have all showed stable disease, but lately my gut was telling me I had progression in my bones that the CTs were not seeing. Earlier this month, I begged my way to a PET (my terrible insurance only wants to pay for CT) which confirmed this week that I do indeed have widespread bone progression, lots of old mets firing up again and many new ones formingas well. My radiologist usually notes when something is likely to be \u201cinflammatory process\u201d and not active disease. I think there must be a way to tell the difference but I\u2019m not sure.",

Your feet and hands should be in water as little as possible. The Epsom salt is probably drawing the chemo toxins into your feet tissues also. I showered exclusively the whole time I was on Xeloda, and never for more than 10 minutes. No baths, no swimming pools. Heat, pressure, and water can all draw the Xeloda chemo into the tissues in your feet and hands and essentially trap it there. If you do a search for \"Lulubee Xeloda Skechers\" you'll probably get search results for a long post I wrote in the All About Xeloda thread on what I learned about minimizing HFS troubles while taking Xeloda longterm.

Not my favorite move, and I hated being hairless, but side effects were manageable once I begged my way out of the weekly dexamethadeath aperitif (ughhhh, no thanks, never again). Weekly Taxol kept me here for 2 more years, bottom line. Thank you, next. I then moved on to several months in HELLaven. It's supposed to be less toxic than Taxol for many women, but it dang near did me in. Who knows--I have a bad case of MTHFR which alters the way I metabolize meds, so YMMV. I'm on my second month of Verzenio + Faslodex so it's too soon to assess how it's going, cancer-wise. I'm too busy managing diarrhea to think about tumor markers much, so I guess that's some sort of dark grace. LOL.",

Skin is clear on Taxol, except for a few tiny white bumps that bubble up mid-week, which I am almost certain is from the steroids I get as a pre-med before Taxol. The dex gives me hot, red cheeks for about 24 hours-- I look like an alcoholic-- and then a day or two later, I get a few of the little bumps. They heal fast, so I cannot complain. If you have never had an MRI, you should be prepared that it's a more nerve-wracking experience than a CT or a PET. MRI's are clattery noisy devils. It's like an oil well in a disco. You will want headphones or earplugs-- I can never really hear my music very well because of the ambient noise, but at least I can focus on trying to hear it. If it's a short MRI, I don't bother with the Xanax they sometimes offer. But the two times I was scheduled for a three-hour full-body MRI? YEPPPP. I took it and never looked back. My secret to getting through an MRI is to NEVER open my eyes. I close them before I am rolled into the tube, and I never ever ever peek. After ten years of BC, I still have no idea what the inside of that blasted tube looks like. Don't want to know, don't need to know.",

And some of you may remember the years when writer Kathy Rich would pop in only once a year, on January 15th, to let us know she was still alive. She lived 19 years at Stage IV. I won't cast aspersions because I have also disappeared for a few months at a time over the years. But I'd sure like to hear from Z soon, and some others I can think of as well.",

This is intriguing and it would be extremely encouraging IF it meant there will be fast access to that treatment for the REST of us. If not, it's just depressing as heck to know we could be getting help but it's not being made available to us. We'll see, I suppose. Seems like everything moves too slowly, except for the cancer. I'd be thrilled to get even three months off treatment.",

My oncologist said that in cases of low Oncotype scores, she relies heavily on patient instinct.  If you feel like you need chemo with a score of 8, I say go with that and Godspeed, my dear. I had a score of zero, the only zero my oncologist has ever seen.  Three years later, I was diagnosed with bone mets.  BUT -- don't jump to conclusions too fast! -- I do not blame the Oncotype, and here's why:  first, I had two types of BC (ILC and IDC), and Oncotype only tests one tumor.  I had innumerable tumors -- multifocal, multicentric disease.  Second, the scores are based on 5 years of Tamox... but I could not take Tamox due to a genetic disorder that puts me at high risk for clots, and I did not want to have an oophorectomy at that time (I did later, right after the mets were found).  My onc left it up to me to decide whether I would have chemo.  She would have preferred to give me four rounds despite the zero score, because she is super cautious.  But my instincts said no. Were my instincts wrong?  You might be shocked to hear that I don't think so.  We discovered later that my particular genetic mutation (in case you're curious, I am homozygous for the MTHFR trait) renders some of the most common chemo drugs potentially lethal.  So maybe my instincts were spot-on after all... despite the fact that my cancer came back just three years later. Incidentally, it's the ILC that spread to my bones.  I would have to go check, but I suspect the Onco was done on an IDC tumor.  In which case, the Oncotype may have been right about the zero for IDC... but just didn't give us a complete picture because both cancers were not tested. At any rate... It Is What It Is.  We can only go forward from here, y'know?  ~lulubee ",
