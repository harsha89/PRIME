They zoom you in there, take a few pics, then pull you out to mark you.  then they put you back in the scanner with the Dr by your side until you're in the right position.  Might get a needle poke at this point, then back into the scanner.  My experience was more complicated than a breast bio, but it took maybe 20 minutes total.   Hang in there!  And good luck.",
