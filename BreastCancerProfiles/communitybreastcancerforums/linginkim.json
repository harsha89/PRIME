Breast cancer treatment comes in stages. Surgery, chemo, possibly radiation, diet, nutrition, medications. Take it one step at a time. You are going to come through this journey. Speak to people about your fears. Here is a great place to do that. Sometimes the fears become smaller the more you talk about them. You are in for a tough few months, then the sun comes out again. Soon you start to feel like a survivor. Then you will even have days when you forget that you had cancer. For now, take it one step at a time and do the best you can. Be super kind to yourself. Talk to your family and friends.Â ",
