On the one hand is the possibility of a bc diagnosis (even if I did take Tamox), and then all that goes with it--rads, chemo, etc.  On the other side is the surgery.  Let's face it--no woman wants to lose her breasts.  But for me, I just can't think of it that way or I won't be able to face it without a huge amount of fear.  It's a life-saving and even more a peace-of-mind saving act.  It's totally personal and one that each woman has to come to on her own in order for it to make sense. taraleec, thanks for your response.  It sounds like you are having a lot of things to deal with.  I'm older than you, 52, but I am single and I have two kids and I am the sole support of myself and my kids.  I can't afford to get sick!  This pbm surgery would keep me out of work for a month.  If I were to get sick, it would be much longer.  Then what would I do?  So I sympathize with you.  It is not easy to be facing this situation with other issues clouding your judgment.  I'm sorry for all that you are facing, and having a young child at the same time makes it that much worse.  I will keep you in my prayers.  Please keep us posted about how you are doing. Hi tweeterbeeker.  Thanks for your words of support and encouragement.  I am 52, and I do have some risk factors other than ADH.  I was over 30 when my first child was born, over 12 at first period.  I have an aunt and cousin who had bc.  No immediate family (mom, sisters).  My onc said there is little chance I would test positive for the bc gene.  Even without the + genetic testing, I want to have the surgery because I am considered high risk, and I don't want to live with the anxiety.  I know myself enough to know that I would never stop thinking about it. The experience I've had so far of repeat mammos, stero needle biopsy (is that table leftover from medievel torture days or what?), surgical biopsy, and dx of ADH, has been difficult, and it's nothing compared to what some of the women here have endured)  I am painfully aware of the vast numbers of women who go through this process--even those whose results are benign.  It is so frightening.  I felt completely alone and like a piece of meat being poked and prodded and passed from one test to another.   The techs and nurses try to be nice, but it's usually not very sincere, and the whole experience feels like an invasion. Thanks again for your responses.   Does anyone know if insurance is a problem if you do not have a bc dx?  I am assuming that if my doctor recommends it, they will consider that cause and cover it.  I sure hope so. Cheers from (cloudy) CT",

You know, in the long run it would save the insurance company money to just let high risk women get PBMs if they want to.  Think of the cost of high risk surveillance--MRI's, Ultrasounds, mammos, possible multiple biopsies--then if a person develops bc, all of the treatment that goes with it, and the possibility of BLMs anyway.  So I am hoping that this logic has reached the virtual consciousness of the insurance companies, and they cover it without too much problem.",
