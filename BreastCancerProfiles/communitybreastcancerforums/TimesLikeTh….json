      "Content": "Mar 22, 2018 11:36PM - edited Mar 22, 2018 11:38PM by TimesLikeThese Hi everyone! I had my surgery on 3/20, and I spent the night in the hospital. I woke up kind of bummed that I had tissue expanders. We were planning for direct to implants. However, my BS said my skin was too fragile from chemo to do immediate implants. So my PS put in the TE's and filled them up a bit. That seems to be the thing that hurts the most. Yikes. The sentinel node and breast tissue where the tumors were located all came back negative. Still waiting on final path, but I'm hopeful it will all be clear. I keep chanting my mantra 'pCR, pCR, pCR.' Hahaha! Gotta keep that positive energy flowing. About the anesthesia and pain meds \u2014 I always get sick after anesthesia, so the team took special measures to keep that from happening. They gave me IV Emend ahead of time and also a scopolamine patch behind my ear. They did not use the gas (mask) either - just the IV drugs. Whatever they did worked, because I had no nausea at all. Such a relief. I'm now at home taking Norco, Gabapentin, Valium to manage pain and taking Zofran to manage the nausea caused by the Norco. I'm not too thrilled that I will have to do another surgery for the exchange because I'm in the process of finding another job (my company is being acquired, and my position is going away). It's going to be a delicate topic that I may eventually have to discuss with an employer if I end up getting an offer. But that worry is for another day. Right now I'm just trying to stay active, do exercises, and walk around the neighborhood at least once a day. I'm really excited that my range of motion in my arms is pretty close to 100%. I didn't even need all the button up shirts. Blessings and good vibes for speedy healing for everyone <3",

I'm scheduled for a skin-sparing bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction (silicone implants over the muscle) on March 20. I'm hoping to have direct implant placement instead of TE's. PS says as long as we don't see any rogue cells in lymph nodes that will require rads and my skin and surrounding tissues all look good, he will go ahead and place the implants. The surgery is going to take upwards of 6 hours, and I will have an overnight stay. Looking forward to getting past this stage of my treatment and on to another 8 months of herceptin/perjeta infusions. Best wishes and speedy healing, everyone <3 -Leanne",

      "Content": "Nov 3, 2017 08:53AM - edited Nov 3, 2017 08:53AM by TimesLikeThese Hey rljessu! I felt all of those things leading up to my first chemo (which was yesterday). I actually had a major shift in treatment plan laid on me just this Tuesday when I went in to see my MO for a follow-up. I was originally scheduled for surgery (BMX) next Tuesday, but the team met and decided they wanted me to have neoadjuvant chemo to try and shrink the masses first. So, they said -- Hey, let's start your chemo day after tomorrow! I ran around like a madwoman trying to pick up everything on the shopping lists from the forums here (super helpful) because I live by myself also. I didn't want to have to drag my butt out to the drug store if I needed something. I ended up getting everything done in one day, including the prescription pickup (Zofran, Dexamethasone, Compazine, Tramadol). My port hasn't been placed yet, but will be done before my next round. Yesterday's treatment was super long -- 6 hours -- but it went very smoothly. IV placement was easy and no big deal (thank God - that was one of my biggest fears). I drank lots of water leading up to the treatment and also did an easy run yesterday morning. Once I got checked in for my appt, I met my nurse (who was amazing). They started with the pre-meds Dexamethasone and Zofran, which lasted about 30 minutes. Next up for me was Pertuzamab (Perjeta), and that took a little over an hour. Then Herceptin, which took 1.5 hours. Then Taxotere for another 1.5 hours, and finished with Carboplatin for a little over 30 minutes. All of those included about a 15 minute flush in between. I never felt anything weird at all. The Taxotere gave me a funny taste, and the Carboplatin felt really cold going in. But it was all pain free and pretty uneventful. I had my mom with me, which was awesome, but I feel like I could do the next round by myself and be totally fine. The nurse also placed a Neulasta on body injector, which will give me an automatically scheduled immune booster later tonight so I don't have to go back in. I'm just supposed to remove it once the injection is done. Super convenient, and also pain free (felt like a mild rubber band snap when it activated). Last night, I slept a little restlessly (probably due to the steroids) and have been keeping up with my Zofran. No real adverse symptoms as of this morning. I had a bit of breakthrough mild nausea late in the night, so I took some Compazine as instructed. That knocked it out and also knocked me out :) I've been working with an online therapist (through Talkspace), and she has me doing mindful meditation every day. I have found it to be extremely helpful in managing my anxiety. I used to take anxiety meds in my earlier years, and was considering asking for them again (still will do it if necessary). But so far, it's been really empowering to apply what I've learned about centering my mind and grounding myself in the moment to overcome the brain drain that anxiety causes. Running (and just being outside in general) also helps keep me sane. Sending prayers, peace, and good vibes your way! --Leanne",

I took a giant break from all things internet during my first 3 rounds of chemo. I got a bit overwhelmed with information and needed a brain breather. I'm halfway through my neoadjuvant PTCH (pertuzamab, taxotere, carbo, herceptin) chemo with 3 more rounds to go. It's been a little rough the first week of each round, and we had to tweak my anti-nausea meds quite a bit. My last round ended up being okay. Finally no vomiting (they added Ativan 1/2 mg to my Zofran/Compazine regimen, and it seemed to do the trick - although I slept a lot) Yay! I have been pretty lucky in that each round by the second and third week, I can RUN -- slow like a turtle, but I can run. Exercise has always kept me sane, and I was really struggling with giving it up. I run around my neighborhood bald as hells, because it's just too hot to wear a hat in Houston right now. I get lots of looks, but I don't care. It makes me feel powerful. Good news is that my tumors have shrunk to the point of no longer being palpable (originally 2.5 and 1.5 cm). My MO says we may be looking at a pathological complete response by the time surgery happens. Another Yay! I had some neuropathy for the first time last week, but it didn't last long. My next infusion is this Thursday. Seriously dreading it. I've done my last 2 infusions by myself. Maybe I will bring a friend this time. Wishing you all well - Prayers and love. Leanne",

Life happened and things have been a little crazy with my job, but I wanted to check in and see how everyone is doing. I had my final round of neoadjuvant TCHP (6 total) on Feb 15. Those last 2 rounds were TOUGH. I had stomach issues beginning with the first round, so I ended up on Prilosec, which helped quite a bit. I had to add Carafate the last 2 rounds because I had throat ulcers. Those symptoms have gone away, thank God. I still have a lot of annoying muscle twitches, and my eyes have been watering nonstop for two weeks, but I'll take that over nausea and nosebleeds any day! My blood counts stayed pretty close to normal the whole time, which was awesome. I had to have a magnesium infusion before my last round of chemo, but that was it. My fuzzy head is looking really crazy, and it makes me giggle when I look in the mirror. My fingernails are almost all loose (disconnected from nail bed halfway down or almost to the cuticle), but not actually falling off. I'm hoping they hold on. I'm scheduled for surgery (BMX with reconstruction) on 3/20 and then on to another 8 months of Herceptin/Perjeta infusions. I had a mammo and ultrasound right before my last round of chemo, and there was no sign of my tumors anywhere and lymph nodes looked clear. Tumors appear to be totally gone. Yay! So, I'm praying I've had a pathological complete response to the chemo and will show no evidence of disease at surgery (so no rads). On a personal life struggle note, about the time I found out I had cancer, my company announced they were being acquired by another company. My team has been waiting 4 months to see if we will have jobs going forward. I got the call yesterday, and I will not have a role in the new company. So I will end up with a 6-month severance. It's all so scary to be dealing with this during treatment, but I've already started applying to other jobs. Just gotta stay positive. We also found out two months ago that my mom has a new breast cancer (she is an 11-year survivor) and is now undergoing treatment. Luckily, hers was caught super early and was non-invasive. Her prognosis is excellent. Whew. Sorry for the super long brain dump. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and are able to do something that fulfills your soul :) -Leanne",

I\u2019m definitely learning some valuable life lessons about letting go and being flexible. I haven\u2019t gotten my port placed yet, but I will have it before the next round. I\u2019m a little leery of the whole IV thing, but I will suck it up for tomorrow. I love to run, so I\u2019m going to get up early to get a run in before treatment.
