      "Content": "May 13, 2013 11:48PM - edited May 13, 2013 11:51PM by Lynn27 Thank you, ladies.  This is why I like the BCO site.  Good advice although some of it was hard to hear.  I do not regret pushing Mom hard to get the final round of biopsies and scans done and to request the oncotyping (still waiting for results).  She didn't understand what kind of information those would provide the oncologist.  But from this point forward, the docs have or shortly will have what they need. You're right:  for me, my stage and my age, my decision tree is necessarily different from Moms.  My job is to make sure Mom understands what the docs are proposing, SEs, different prognoses, etc. so that she can apply her own decision tree as fully informed as possible.  The only \"forcing\" I'm going to do is to make sure she takes any anti-emetic, etc. comfort drugs that are prescribed so she is as comfortable as possible.  Here's hoping for a triple positive typing. Thanks again, C-Squared, for the recommendation to get them a recorder for the doctor meetings.  That will be very useful. I just noted the qualifier for this forum.  I'll move over to the care-giver forum.  It's more appropriate for me to post there.  Thank you everyone.",

I've been using my own experience to talk her through all the testing that has been done (biopsies, MRI, PET) and to futilely try to convince her that there really are good anti-nauseant and anti-emetic drugs out there (Mom!  I didn't throw up once during chemo).  But, at 81 she is either unable or unwilling to comprehend what needs to happen and what will probably happen.  I'm going with her and Pop tomorrow for the first visit with the oncologist.  I'm the note-taker and I'll make damn sure he uses the same \"comfort\" drugs that my own oncologist used.  Here are the questions: Sorry about the incoherent ranting, but that's pretty much the sum of how I'm reacting to all this:  incoherently. Thank you in advance.",
