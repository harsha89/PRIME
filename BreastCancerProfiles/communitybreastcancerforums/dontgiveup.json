I am releived to have read it, and think I need to find me a womens support group localy. I hate being tired and I know family and friends think I am faking it. I said the other day I was exhausted and my sister in law made a smirking noise like I was lying, I had to leave. I am not a complainer, I dont go around to any of my family and talk about my physical being. I teach Gods word, I love livng a life of being positive and trusting God. Its just that I am tired all day long, wake up exhausted, its crazy but I remain thankful. Your post just blessed me and I needed to read that today.",
