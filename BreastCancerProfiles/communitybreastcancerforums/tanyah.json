Hope this helps and you're doing well!  I felt much better after I met with the MO and had a plan.     ",

Everyone's feelings on the genetic testing and whether or not to take any proactive action are so personal and going to be based on your own experience.  I have a younger sister who is 35 and obviously very concerned.  Having grown up with a Mom who had a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction at my Age 13, I have never been particularly emotionally attached to my breasts.  I would have gladly done a preventative mastectomy with reconstruction had the genetic testing indicated that would be covered.  Unfortunately, it did not.  Having now suffered through some of my treatment, I told my sister that in her position I would have the preventative surgery even if the genetics cannot be identified and simply pay out of pocket. The genetic counsellor will definitely help provide a lot of insight.  Having said that, I went to my appointment feeling certain I would one day be diagnosed with breast cancer.  The geneticist very much downplayed my risk based on the stats and I now wish I had listened to my gut and pushed for more extensive testing.  Of course, hingsight is 20/20.  Feel free to PM me or post more here with any questions.  Our situations are very similar although I certainly hope the similarities end with our Moms. :)        ",
