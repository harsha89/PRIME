They started me on Gemzar, Herceptin (I was Her2+) and Zometa. After 6 months Jan '09)Â the PET scan looked 98% better (Dr's quote). I had a mastectomy, we dropped the Gemzar and started Femara by mouth. Now the liver mets are back and worse than before so we restarted the Gemzar. We have a scan scheduled for 9/21 and hope the Gemzar works as well as before. I feel great with no pain so we have faith in the Gemzar. I have a great oncologist at Gibbs Cancer Center in SC. Ask about the Gemzar if it might work in your case?",
