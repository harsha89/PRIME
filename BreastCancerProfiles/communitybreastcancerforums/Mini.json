Last week I had to have a pic line put in my upper arm. For some reason I feel really down about this. I feel like a constant patients when I only agreed to go bald and be a patient once every 3 weeks when I have chemo. The plastic skin they put over this is so itchy it is driving me mad, Have any of you found this happened to you. I also have to go next friday 10th to have Tattoo for Radium.  Can any of you tell me anything about this. Like how many do the usually do and is it stars, crosses lines, does it hurt. Today I feel like jumping off this rollercoaster but I know I wont. Thanks.........Mini",
