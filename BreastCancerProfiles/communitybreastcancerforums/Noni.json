I feel physically better than I have since being diagnosed. I have terrible bone pain when I don't take pain medication, but that's under control. The hospice team has been great and supports my wishes. I've met with nurses, physical therapists, a chaplain, a physician's assistant, and a psych nurse and they've all been so helpful. The chaplain has been the biggest surprise. We've had several good chats and they've led to amazing peace. I get out of the house once or twice a week, but really don't have the strength for much more than that. I am fortunate to have visits from family and friends to keep me sane. My brother moved in to help and my husband is home on family leave. We laugh because many days we wake up and none of us what the date, or even day of the week. It's kind of a nice feeling!  ",

We are going to use that money to purchase the new house for DH and DD. Our current home needs a lot of work that we were doing until cancer took over. My DH admitted recently that he's overwhelmed with the thought of moving (along with everything else), and doesn't know where to start. I figured the three of us as a family can have fun picking the new place and it will make the transition easier for them. So, house hunting is also on my calendar for the next few months. We will have friends, family, or movers to help with the heavy lifting so the timing is good. Trying to keep nothing but happy thoughts!",

      "Content": "Noni wrote: I know it doesn't really need to be said since everyone's experience is different, but I ask that you kindly respect my decision. I hope this doesn't turn into a heated discussion. I met with my MO on Monday and told him I've had enough. Every treatment I've been on has been harder than the last and I've seen nothing but mild to moderate progression. My MO has gently persuaded me for months to keep trying something new and I trusted him completely, but I have hit the wall and feel I have to say enough. I was on Doxil for 3 months and due to a severe allergic reaction it was the worst time of my life. Yes, it did work quite a bit but there was still progression. Some of the smaller tumors shrank but the larger ones continued to grow, including the ones in my spine which is pretty significant. The spot on my liver which was only recently a minor 2 mm annoyance that we were keeping an eye on, is now over 3 cm. Boo. I switched from Doxil to Doxorubicin on March 1st, hoping that the severe reaction was simply to the lipids in Doxil which prevent hair loss and cardiovascular damage. Sadly that wasn't the case. I continued to experience the debilitating all over body rash, pretty severe cognitive issues, fatigue and almost immediately the hair loss. I have spent the past 3+ months bedridden and in severe pain. This is not the life I want for myself or my husband and child. My DH and I talked in great detail and very realistically about what the future holds and how that compares to my (our) wishes. So, we laid it out with the MO this week. I will have one more infusion of Doxorubicin at the end of March. Hopefully that will kill off enough cancer cells to hold them back for a couple of months. My DH, DD, and I have a cruise at the end of May for my 50th birthday. In early June my DD gets out of school and with God's mercy I will pass over the summer giving DD and DH time to spend together, grieve and heal before school begins. I pray that the s/e and allergic reaction from the Doxorubicin will lesson in the two months before the cruise starts so my body can feel relatively normal for our trip. I have continued to say and believe that the chemotherapy has always been much harder and painful than the cancer itself. It doesn't make sense for me to continue to try option after option, essentially stealing all quality of life. And I am grateful that my MO is backing me up on this. March 29 - last chemo March 30 to May 20 - clear the toxins and heal the body May 20 to May 30 - vacation with family (praying for s/e free) June 14 - last day of school, begin hospice Summer 2017 - pass away peacefully Yes, it may all be a pipe dream, but I am hoping for as close as possible. My MO said without any treatment I'd only have a few months. I'm hoping that's true. My life and my family's life is too busy and involved for me to be bedridden and unable to participate. That's been hard everyone. Please keep us in your prayers. JJ Noni, 50 year old mother of an 11 year old brainy girl. Taking a break from BCO for a while. Now on hospice.

I have more energy and truly believe that it's working on shrinking my lung tumors because I have been breathing better. I've also been eating better, which is a mixed blessing. I indulged in too much holiday ham and the sodium caused quite a bit of fluid back up, including around my lungs. I doubled up on my water pills and water intake for a couple of days and it made quite a difference. I never thought how that could play a part. My biggest concern at the moment is what was a minor rash on my legs last month and has turned into something quite more serious. I've been put on steroids and Claritin daily. The rash is now all over my body except my hands and feet. It's red, itchy, and gets oozy. Hate it with a passion as it makes sleeping nearly impossible. But I have to keep reminding myself that my breathing is better. In my book that's more important. My next infusion is February 1st and I'm hopeful things will be much improved by then. I'll have a scan the first of March. How is everyone else doing?",

Then he's going to try mapping / sim immediately after the second is drained, so hopefully it will be easier. It's frustrating because I really need this radiation. The pain in my spine is dreadful.

But I managed to keep up with everyone and got to see my girl laugh and smile all night. Priceless.

It's fairly easy to do it online as long as you have all your meds and doctor information. Provided you have enough work credits to earn SSDI your children will also receive benefits. Each child receives 50% of your benefit, but it maxes out at 130% I believe. For instance, if your benefit is $2,000 per month and you have four kids, they would each receive $500 a month. Your spouse also receives benefits as long as the children are under 16. Good luck to you.",

This last year has been a gift of sorts in the way I view my world and my priorities. I've done quite a bit of traveling, visiting friends and family. There are people I've grown closer to and others I've drifted away from. I have a CT scan coming up next Wednesday. It's my regular 3 month scan, but I've been experiencing pain in my rib and my MO and I both felt something so cross your fingers for me.

I had my first port placed the day before my first infusion. It was painful everytime it was accessed, even while using the emla cream. A few times it was challenging to access and it got to the point where my face started to swell. It turns out there was a clot in the port and I had to have it removed. I was shocked at how much my chin, neck, and cheeks swelled and it was so damn painful. Not to mention I was stuck in the hospital for a week. They put another power port in a week later, on the other side. I have the mouse tail, tho you can't see it in this picture. I know it's petty, but I am sad at all the scars on my chest and neck. ",

She's been seeing her therapist for several years for other issues, so I am glad she has someone she can trust to speak with. I heard about the group at school from another mom with cancer. When my DD started I asked if she met my friend's son. She said that there were so many kids with a parent who was sick that they had to split the group. That makes me sad, but ever so thankful that the school provides this support for the students. Thanks to all who have shared in this thread. It's really helped to remind me that I'm facing a marathon, not a sprint.",

They pulled 800 ml and discussed all the options, should fluid build up become a regular thing. I'm not against the catheter. I have five new tumors in my lungs, four spots on my spine and three on my hips. My largest lung tumor has positioned itself so its impeding the flow of blood, so while the RO is taking care of the spine next week, he's also going to radiate the tumor and hopefully it will help with breathing. They sent me home with oxygen and I'm to be on it all the time. I'd be more okay with this if I was actually breathing better, but I don't see much of difference. Obviously I will keep it up and hope things will get better. I have 15 sessions of radiation and then I move on to Doxil. I hope that's my lucky charm.",

Happy belated anniversary and bless your husband for getting the family together for fame night at the hospital. Can I offer a little hope from hospice? I have been doing terrible since last winter, with nothing but progression and dangerous chemo side effects. One of my MOs warned that if I stopped all treatment that I'd probably only have a couple months. Well, it's been three months since my last infusion and I must say I haven't felt better since I started treatment in December 2015. If you and your MO want to switch to hormonals but fear that you're not strong enough for the 3 month clean out period, it might be wise to have a little faith. You are the master at bouncing back and who knows, your body could blossom during that time without outside toxins beating it up. This cancer business is wicked hard to track. There's no way of truly knowing what the heck it's going to do. Praying that you remain strong and healthy, and out of the hospital.",

Way too much pain and suffering. My first chemo failed, and there's progression with the hormones. My MO says to be patient but when a mass grows during treatment, it's not good. I need someone to spell it out for me and hear when I say that I cannot take another 6 months spending every day coughing, vomiting, soiling myself, and listening to my husband raise our daughter alone beyond my bedroom door.
