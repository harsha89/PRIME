I then went back two weeks later and needed to get a simulator to plan my treatment. I am half way through my 15 treatments and a letter came through the mail saying i need to get an upper abdominal ultrasound. I am so worried about this.  Has anyone else had this ! has cancer been detected.  Thank You   Dx 6/19/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 1/22 nodes, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

On the CT scan they saw 2 liver cysts and i was given an ultrasound just to be sure and they all came back clear. I am beginning to get scared as I have not heard anyone else getting an ultrasound during radiotherapy.  I am so scared of giving the doctor a call ( I know I shouldn't).  ",
