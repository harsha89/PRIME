Has not gotten worse has maybe gotten a tad lighter though. In some light it is almost not there. There is still no swelling, change in skin, itchyness, nipple retraction, or heat. It has been 18 days now with no change for the worst. The NP at the U of M breast cancer clinic said there was no reason to worry and it has no symptoms of ibc. She also gave me a full exam on both breasts. She said she is glad I came in for peace of mind and a follow up is not necessary. After 18 days would it be changing? IBC is what I am petrified of. Thanks ladies <3 Log in to post a reply",

I did what I should and went to a breast clinic and then to a derm. Neither were concerned about any type of cancer. I really whole heartedly am sorry for using this board. I know it is not meant for me and my anxiety. In all honestly while I was pregnant in 2016 my Grandmother past from melanoma and my Great Aunt from breast cancer (but this was decades after she was initially dxd). I had a health scare also during pregnancy with a tumor in my jaw so I really am still anxious and suffering from post partum anxiety. I do so good for months upon months and something comes up and I lose it. Again Thank You for responding to me as well as all the other wonderful ladies.",

I know that U of M is one of the best so I know my anxiety is just super high. My spot is a very pale pink and honestly has faded from when it first appeared and never has changed size or shape. The rest of the breast looks completely normal also. I think I may give it a bit and see what happens since it really doesn't bother me physically just mentally! Anxiety is so stupid! I spoke with an oncologist at the breast clinic also via email as I work for the University and she told me it does not sound concerning to her at all and that it would be changing rapidly and be a much larger area than a pencil eraser. She actually called me to tell me to relax and that she sees IBC and this sounds nothing like it. I suppose I need to trust the medical providers at the breast clinic and take there advice that if something changes come back but that neither think it has anything to do with cancer. Again thanks for taking the time to respond to me.",
