I am having difficulties controling the swelling since Easter. I had a lot of people at our home, I immediately got sick after that which lasted till just a few days ago (cold virus) and then a birthday party for daughter and prom dress shopping this weekend and I am a mess. My arm is looking more like stage 2 and I am experiencing swollen nodes under the arm and also on the same side in the groin area. I also have some trunk swelling. I am brand new to this and do wear a lymphediva sleeve during the day and wrap at night. The LE specialist that I saw has recommended drainage therapy daily for two weeks, but my work schedule is not allowing it. I am afraid my immune is shot right now because I am constantly exhausted and I can't seem to get control of the swelling. I am reading the books that were rec.d on here and also some extras I found on Amazon. I am interested if anyone has had any luck with the various pumps or manual drainage. I have surgery on May 22 and I am pretty sure I can do the drainage at that time, but I am afraid I may have too much damage by then.... Log in to post a reply",

I have had 17 surgeries in the last two years. My left side has failed at a DIEP, a lat flap and an implant. I ave factor v Leiden, which is a clotting disorder and I end up having to be thinned and it is a fine line between bleeding out and clotting. I only had three nodes removed with a double mast. and was assured that it was ok to use the arm with nodes removed because the other side we had 15 surgeries. I had an IV AND bp cuff for 15 SURGERIES, because the dr's are idiots. I have had infections, wound vac and literal hell for 2 years, which you all know. In January I had an exchange implant and lift and the IV was in the other arm. That surgery set off the lymphedema. I live in a rural area in Northern Ca and have had a challenge finding help. I went to one \"le\" therapist that said wrap it, raise it, don't lift it, exercise lightly and live with it. I found a new lady who does le drainage, but my bosses dad just died and we are short handed with two others on medical leave. The only time the le can do drainage is at 8am 45 min from my work and I start work at 7 at a school. I am so happy to find this group and will be familiarizing myself more. I appreciate your wonderful support. A little about me- I am 42, lost my mom to bc at 51, she had it twice, my maternal Grandma is a two time survivor. I have 3 children 18 girl, 15 girl and an 8 year old boy. Been married 24 years and am a runner and photographer. I am also cancer free as of my PET I had in December :)",

So that would make me think any kind of chemicals (household/beauty products etc) should be avoided by touch. I have a script for silvadene and the second I have any type of an open wound I clean it with rubbing alcohol and then slather with this cream and cover. Good luck to both of you ladies!",
