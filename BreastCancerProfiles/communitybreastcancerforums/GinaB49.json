Also have quite a lot of back and hip pain. Just can't even think abou the drive to the Tuesday appointment.  I have 25 rad sessions so I'll be here hanging out too, I have to be away from my family for those treatments and I think that will be the hardest. I thought I was going to be happy to be looking out to the rads, maybe when I start feeling a bit better I will be.  Just read through the thread and there are a lot of positive thoughts and words out there, so this is where I need to be.",

Just wondering if someone could give me a heads up on what to expect for the marking appointment - it looks like people were saying 1.5 - 2 hours.  Why does it take the length of time?",
