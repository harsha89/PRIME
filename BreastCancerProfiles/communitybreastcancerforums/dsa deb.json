Look forward to chatting w/all of you.  And, I don't typically write an enclopedia's worth of 'stuff' like i apparently did in this post.!!    Hope everyone has great evening.  !!   SMILE, SMILE, SMILE----ha!  someone may have to remind me to do that after my 1st chemo treatment!

HA hope everyone has a great independence day weekend!  and may the SE's get blown up with the fireworks  !!!!!!!     deb    ",

Mouth sores, etc.: my oncol gave me the salt water/baking soda mix to use for 1 week immediately following treatment @ 6x daily (minimum), then said to use the Biotene productes, especially the mouthwash for the 2nd week before next treatment--i'm on dd AC/T--so every other week for the mix above.  i went in for 2nd AC treatment yesterday & he was very pleased that i'd had no sores -- told me to be aggressive about following the above, as well as avoiding spicy foods that tend to aggravate the issue. Headsores:  tmarina mentioned (quite a few days ago) that she's used nioxin products for her hair condition, at the advice of her hairdresser.  i've also heard that baby shampoo & withhazel for the baldness is helpful. Hairloss:  my nurse said that depending on treatment plan, hair loss starts at different stages, with some experiencing more head pain & longer timeframe during which hair is lost.  i told her i didn't care about the treatment issue, all i wanted to know was when to expect the \"clump loss\" because that's when i wanted to make sure i was ready to do the deed with my buzz.   am going today to get the 2 or 3\" buzz...not going bald yet.  think i've got to get used to looking at myself w/at least a tidbit of hair......then i'll go w/ the 'yul brenner' look---is that how his name is spelled?!  Supplements:  designermom, i've noticed that you take a few xtra's that i think would be very helpful to the body & our condition, but for some reason my onco will only approve a b12 pill @ 100 mg 2x daily; a multi-vitamin & cal-mag citrate.  my 86 yo mom, who is miss vita queen has a laundry list of things i \"should\" be taking, according to her.  and, after reading much of the materials about those vitamins, i'd have to admit that it appears there would be good/healthy outcome.     i think you mentioned that you were in the medical field before, maybe your onco is more comfortable (knowledgeable) about the positives of supplementing our treatment regime.  i'd like to know what you take so i could 'suggest' that to my onco...... sherri:   sounds like you're doing much better on this new drug routine.  Hooray!!  you've had a rough go! tmarina:  girl, you've got to take care of thyself!!   hope you're feeling much better & everything is under control.  i give up on anything else----can't remember up/down anymore!!   2nd treatment hasn't been quite so bad as the 1st one, although the sink & toilet remain very good friends of mine.!!  question;  if you are taking emend for anti-nausea, have you had heartburn problems? i didn't have emend my 1st treatment....only had severe nausea/dehydration/loss of everything.......so got put on emend this round & i have heartburn something fierce.   cheat sheet says 'tums/pepcid' are ok.....anyone have recommendations?!?! also, i'm losing hair everywhere!!!!!  not just my head-----anyone else having this same thing?  sorry of that's offensive----but, it's dadgum annoying to me & not physically comfortable, to say the least! i think we're all down in the dumps as of late----why wouldn't we be when our SE's are swirling us around & downward like the tidy-bowl man! deb    ",
