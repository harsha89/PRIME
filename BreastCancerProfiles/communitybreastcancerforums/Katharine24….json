You just can't make these things up.",

Cried like a baby as hubby was buzzing my head. But it sure beats being dead. Plus, it grows back.. just hate looking like a cancer patient. Have scarves, turbins and wig ... but still. Cancer sucks. However, since all my tests were negative at least it didn't spread. Thanks for letting me vent. The only people that really get \"it\" are women with breast cancer, so thank you!!  I'm stage III too and intend to be around for many years to come!!",
