The PET scan showed 3 areas that need further study. My oncologist isn't concerned. I'm having a colonoscopy on Tuesday to check out a thickening in my rectum. After chemo is complete I'll have an MRI of the right femur and fifth vertebrae. I'm focusing on the here and now and not projecting. The here and now concern is hair loss. Yesterday was exactly two weeks since first chemo. My scalp was feeling prickly/tingly. I ran my hands through my hair, and I had several strands of hair on my palms and fingers. Not typical for me. I have 2 questions. Has anyone else had questionable PET scan results? What's your hair loss experience? Next chemo on 7/6. I was green and shaky from 6/14 - 19 after the first chemo on 6/12. I also had bone pain and blisters on my tongue and private parts. Any info will be greatly appreciated. Blessings to all. MariaTeresaG",

Margins were small but clear...1.5mm and .3cm. 4/5 nodes positive for cancer. 1 node's cancer was 1cm. The others were less than 1 cm. The tumor at 7 o'clock was 3x4cm. I received the nodes news yesterday. The port will be installed on 6/1. I don't know when chemo will begin and still need a PET scan. I think the port will make the reality sink in. Not that I can ignore my large incisions. I have two granddaughters, 4 and 7. My son explained to the elder that I am sick and will be given lots of medicine that will have side effects. I asked her how she thinks I'll look with a bald head. She responded, \"Beautiful.\" ðŸ’– Hugs and white light to all here. MG",

Having that disease in our family created concerns of it being hereditary for my younger sister and me. My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimers. Alzheimers is another disease that creates a sense of unease for future health. There wasn't a history of cancer in the family. In 2003 my sister was diagnosed with inoperable neuroendocrine cancer. We were devastated by the diagnosis and prognosis. Cathy was treated with various types of chemotherapy for 10 years. She passed in January 2013. Two years after Cathy was diagnosed, I was diagnosed with renal cancer. I had a partial nephrectomy only. I am a 10 year survivor. Yay! In December 2014 my husband was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophogeal junction. He was never a smoker. He had stopped drinking alcohol 27 years ago. He didn't experience indigestion. Tom was first treated with chemo and radiation. Then in April he had an esophagectomy (80% taken) with stomach pull up. 20% of his stomach was removed. Recovery was difficult. The day after Tom completed radiation I found a lump in my breast. It was ILC. I chose to have a lumpectomy. Due to having to care for Tom post surgery, I put my surgery off as long as doctors would allow. Unfortunately, 4/5 lymph nodes were cancerous. I've completed chemotherapy and will begin radiation this week. My husband is in remission and I hope to very soon. God's blessings to all. MariaTeresaG",
