However, it did not work this way After operation margins had DSIC and I had a re-incision and also they put port in my chest for future chemo...My cancer is very agressive, and HER2 positive, so I need chemo...Yesterday my surgeon called me and said, that results came from re-incision, I have to do mastectomy , because they found more DCIS and single cancer cells...I am very scared and frustrated, some friends told me to get sec. opinion, but I think I don't need it...My first operation lumpectomy, I was so happy it was over, and now again... Please, ladies, support me...I will find out about the date of operation tomorrow..Thank you. Olga",
