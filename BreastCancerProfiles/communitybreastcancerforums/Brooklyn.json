It has been a very manageable chemo for me so far and I actually feel better than I have in a long time! I have a lot of my energy back and do not even feel like I need a nap in the middle of the day (and with two small boys that is a good thing!) I also live in ohio and am pretty sure you will be going to the cancer center I go to because I think they may be the only ones in ohio offering the trial... (if so it is a wonderful place!) I started the trial last October but was randomized into the physicians choice portion and put on Navelbine and Herceptin which was effective for only a few months... since starting on TDM-1 three weeks ago the large palpable skull met on the back of my head can hardly be felt at all!!!! So I am very encouraged that it is doing its job! I sincerely hope that TDM-1 works for you and gets your cancer under control! Thanks for starting this thread as I am also interested in hearing about others experiences on this drug... good luck to you!",

I am tired for about the next two-three days with nausea on and off but zofran takes care of the nausea and the tiredness is usually helped by going to bed a little early... I rarely have to take a nap and it really doesn't affect my schedule. I have a 4 and 6 year old and I am fine to run after them. I have never had a problem with low platelets or neuropathy. Dry mouth is a pain but start on Biotene right away, it makes a big difference. I hope you do well on it! Let me know if you have any other questions!",

I found out yesterday that after 3 years on kadcyla I have progression to my Sacrum and Femurs... It's a feeling I had finally pushed to the back of my mind, that feeling of fear and sadness, when you hear it's moved on again. I will be starting a new treatment of taxol and perjeta after getting radiation. This will be my 5th treatment course in 5 and a half years and all I can hear is one of my infusion nurses telling me that once people get to their 5th and 6th treatments they start going through them like water and it doesn't take long before they are gone 😞 She told me that about a year ago and I have never forgotten it because I knew my next treatment course would be my 5th... I feel like nothing is going to help now... Has anyone else been told this about treatment courses after their 3rd or 4th ones??? I'm just so sad, I have two little boys and want to stay around to watch them grow but her statement gives me little hope...
