You do have to be a little more careful with movement, but I never worried about the infusions and blood draws. There is a 1\" horizontal scar there, but it doesn't bother me. As far as germs, we had a hand sanitzer pump at the front door...gel in/gel out (just like a hospital room) for everyone. I also let everyone know that because of compromised immune system during chemo, I would not be attending a lot events, family gatherings, etc. Everyone was very supportive. Good luck today. I'll add your name to my rosary list.",

I cried the whole time my hubby was shaving my head. He was telling jokes trying to lighten the mood (he is a joker-one of the reasons I married him), but nothing is funny about losing your hair when it's YOUR HAIR. An emotional side effect I wasn't ready for. But after I got used to my wig and some cute hats it isn't so bad. I feel good in some of my cute hats and my 'sassy' wig.",

That is usually the cause of the bone/muscle aches. Also, have you been taking Claritin? My MO said take it for 5 days, but I took it for 10 days. And if the valium/flexeril are working, use them to push through the intense days, especially to get your rest. Rest is so important for your body to recover before the next round. Take it day by day - hour by hour if you have to. YOU CAN DO THIS!! ",

I started TC on Jan. 16, 2018 and completed it on March 20, 2018. Remembering that all BC treatment responses are different, here is my journey and tips. First, if you are reading this - don't forget to drink lots of water and pee, pee, pee, especially in the first 24 hours. My side effects were minimal after the first chemo; then getting more progressive as the chemos compounded. The worse was the muscle/bone discomfort from the Neulasta shot, but only lasting 3-4 days-Tylenol and a 30-45 minute walk helped. I tried a heating pad after my February treatment and that seem to make pain more intense. Miralex in my morning beverage because I'm prone to constipation and I feared binding up chemo waste in my bowel. I added cherry concentrate to my water bottle during the metal mouth days. Use a good lubricating lotion on your hands and feet at night to assist with the neuropathy. My mantra was \"I have Breast Cancer - Hear me Roar\"...I said it every morning to get me motivated. You're stronger than you know and smarter than you think; you're going to sail through this. As my nieces and nephews say, \"You Got This!\"",
