We didn't have results from the MRI at the time of the biopsy and my surgeon said he still thought it was benign when he removed the lump. The results of the MRI showed the tumour as probably malignant and the biopsy confirmed IDC, grade 1. So, in my case, only one of the 3 non-invasive diagnostic methods showed my cancer.",

There were actually 7 of 12 nodes involved; 6 macro and 1 micro. The largest node was 1.2cm which was bigger than the 0.9cm primary tumour in my breast. It looks like there was also some DCIS in there. The left breast was free of cancer, but there were micro-calcifications and lots of fibrous tissue with only 10% fat. I feel that I made the right call with having a BMX. My surgeon said he didn't like to do both at the same time but would if that's what I wanted. My argument was one time anesthesia and one recovery. Now since I'll need chemo and rads I'm doubly glad I made the choice I did. My tumour sample is in for hormone receptor status testing. I'm not sure whether or not they'll run an oncotype test. I have an appointment to see a MO on May 6 and RO on June 22, so it looks like chemo first in May and then rads. I'm glad to have an appointment. I'll make sure to educate myself as much as possible about the chemo so I can ask lots of questions. I spoke with my surgeon and he said he can install a port for me. He said a PICC would be another option, but from what I can see I would much prefer a port. I would like to continue to stay active and work through as much of my chemo as I can. Plus, summer is coming up, I live only a mile away from a beautiful lake, and I can swim with a port. Thanks for the link to the staging, Lolis. I had looked through that after finding the nodes were positive. That's how I figured I was now stage III. Once I'm through chemo and rads I'll push harder for the genetic testing. I asked and my GP thinks it would be a good idea. She tried to order it for me but wasn't able to. I hope she can get me a referral to a genetic councilor who could order the test. I don't have a strong family history, but that's mostly because there are not many female relatives on my mom's side. My mom's ovarian cancer and my breast cancer are the only ones that would qualify me for the testing. My mom's mother never had cancer and all her 8 siblings were half siblings. Her father died as a young man in WWII. My sister died at 51 years old and did not have cancer that we know of. Holeinone, I will definitely ask about DD chemo as opposed to every 3 weeks. Ladyb, I joined the May chemo thread. I'm sure it will be very helpful as I'm going through treatments. Thanks Jillian for posting. It's so good to see others who are many years out w/o recurrence. My s-i-l had stage III IDC in 2008 and has not had recurrence. She had a very large tumour but no nodes involved. Tanya, thanks for reminding me that the cancer has been removed at this point. It does help. I had my surgery in Campbell River and I'll be doing chemo there as well. My MO and RO are in Victoria, so I'll be going there for consultations. I'll also have to do rads in Victoria and hope to tay at the Vancouver Island cancer lodge. There are weekly shuttles and private planes to transport those of us who live up-island. Are you finished with Taxol yet? Have you done rads yet or is that still in your future? You are right, 2Tabbies, the waiting is the hardest. I feel better now that I have some appointments set. DayLily15; I was also pretty bummed about my stage III dx. Will you be having chemo in May also? If so, I'll probably be seeing you on the May chemo thread. We can help each other out. Dancingdiva; My mom also said for her the chemo (for her last bout with ovarian cancer) was not too bad, but radiation was really hard. I'm hoping I'll be able to work through most of my chemo, but will have to see how I tolerate it. Kornelia",

I'm Kornelia and I haven't been officially diagnosed with any stage yet although it looks like it will be stage III from the last little bit of info I got. I was dx in early February with IDC, grade 1 and a tumour about 1cm in size. Margins were not clear after biopsy/lumpectomy and lymph nodes had not been checked because my surgeon thought it was a fibroadenoma. Both mammogram and ultrasound in November 2014 were inconclusive (dense breasts) and MRI was the Friday before my Monday biopsy. We didn't have the MRI results before the biopsy, but when we got the report it did show probable malignancy. I had BMx w/o reconstruction 4 weeks ago today (March 23rd) and I'm still waiting for my pathology report. After that is finalized (any day now?) it will most likely be at least a week before I get to speak with an oncologist. My surgeon and GP have been very good and keep checking to see if results are in yet. I got a verbal over the phone a week ago that 6 of 12 nodes were involved. It really threw me for a loop because I went in to surgery thinking I was stage I (a 1cm, grade 1 tumour and nothing showed on lymph nodes on MRI). So with the 6 nodes it looks like it would be stage III now? I'm trying to remain calm and positive but it's so hard when I don't have much info. I don't even know hormone receptor or HER2 status, never mind Oncotype. I was looking for others who had similar stats to mine and started a couple of posts. No one has yet responded with anything similar to mine, so that was freaking me out a little. I came to the stage III board in the hopes of finding something similar and landed on this thread. I read through the first 2 pages and found a couple others with small, grade 1 IDCs and several nodes and felt some relief. I'm not alone. Thank you to all of you veterans who have posted. I will go on to read the rest of the thread so I can get to know you better. I recognize a few names from other threads; Momine from the Living w/o Reconstruction boards and the F&F facebook group. I'm 52 and I have a 15 y/o daughter. My mom is a (3 time!) ovarian cancer survivor and my dad is almost 20 years in remission from prostate cancer so I have good cancer fighting genes. 99% of the time I'm positive and upbeat, but the last week has been particularly difficult. I'm recovering from surgery very well and I returned to work a week ago. I don't know what's next for my treatment but I'm ready to fight.",

My haircut was free because I donated my hair to make wigs for kids with cancer. I had over 12 inches to donate :-) I also got a few hats and scarves as well as some pocketed tank tops at Value Village (with a 30% off card ~ yay!) so I'll be ready once my hair starts falling out. I asked my surgeon as well as my GP about genetic testing. Surgeon was totally unhelpful; said unless you have a family history of breast cancer, they won't do it, and my mom's ovarian cancer doesn't count. I think he just didn't want to be bothered. He's a very good surgeon, but I sense that he doesn't really like the office consultation part of his job. In the OR he shines. My GP was much more helpful. I'll try with the MO as well when I have my meeting. For now, that's lower priority for me than getting through chemo and rads. Thanks Lolis, muska, and Tanya for letting me know that working through most of chemo will be doable. I only work part-time as it is so I hope to be able to schedule my work around appointments as much as possible. I'm thinking Wednesdays would be best for chemo since I have every other Wednesday and Friday totally off and my longest days are Tuesdays. Hopefully they'll let me pick the day. DayLily15; I see my MO on May 6 and I'll hopefully get my chemo schedule soon after that. I will call to get an appointment with my surgeon for a couple days after the MO so we can schedule a day to put in the port. It will be good to have another Canadian stage III sister in the May chemo thread. How is radiation going for you Tanya? How is your sister doing with her treatments?",

And thank you to everyone who has posted photos and video; it really helps those of us just starting. Please add me to the group. I started on October 7th and am having 16 sessions total (no boosts as I had BMx w/o reconstruction) over 15 days. One of my days (Wed the 14th) I will have 2 treatments so that I can finish on the 28th in time to make it home for dress rehearsal for a musical that my daughter and I are in. So far my first 3 treatments have gone well; pretty fast and uneventful. I have 3 pinpoint tattoos and no stickers or sharpie marker spots. The techs are super fast at lining me up each time; less than a minute. I did notice a small area of red pinpoints and an increased temperature a few hours after my treatments. This morning everything looks and feels normal. I'm using just a regular unscented water based lotion that was recommended by my RO techs 3 times a day. I'm getting a total dosage of 40 grays; 250 cGy per treatment. The cancer center in Victoria, BC is over 4 hours away from my home so I have to stay closer during the week. My husband and daughter came with me on Wednesday and we've all been staying with my m-i-l who lives half an hour away for a visit. Monday (tomorrow) is our Thanksgiving in Canada. We'll have the big dinner today and my husband and daughter will head back up north tomorrow. On Tuesday I'll start staying at the cancer lodge which is only a 5-10 minute walk from the treatment centre. Friday I'll take either a shuttle or small private plane home and Monday in a week I'll come back down here again via shuttle or plane. I will have to pay a little closer attention, but I realized yesterday that it appears I'm being treated in the \"women's wing\" of my facility. We have some shelves with paper bags to keep our gowns for the duration of treatment. I have not seen any men's names on any of the paper bags (about 50), I haven't seen any men awaiting treatment in the waiting area, and so far all the techs I've seen have been women. There are 6 radiation machines total at the centre and 2 that appear to be part of this \"wing\". I'll have to do some snooping closer to the other machines to see if I can see another waiting area with men's names on the paper bags.",

I can't directly address fatigue from rads yet since I just started on Wednesday and have only had 3 treatments, but I thought I'd chime in since I have my own house cleaning business as well. So far I've been able to keep working my regular schedule (averaging about 25 hours per week) throughout my treatments; surgeries and dose dense chemo. I kept really well hydrated (100oz or more of non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages), ate plenty of protein and lots of fruit and veggies. I believe that staying active has helped keep my side effects to a minimum. I did have fatigue and took regular naps while on chemo, but the fatigue was manageable. Most people who have completed chemo and rads say that chemo was worse for fatigue than rads. My rads is out of town so I've had to take a few weeks off work, but I plan to keep active and work out by exercising and riding my bike throughout rads. I've just joined the exercise during treatment thread and plan to keep myself accountable by posing my daily activity there. You may want to check out that thread. Quite a few of the regular posters kept very physically active during radiation treatments.",

A couple hours after taking my meds (Emend, Ondansitron, and Dexamethasone) I was feeling better. Yesterday and so far today have been great, similar to AC #1. I was more proactive with my anti-constipation meds (took 1 Senekot S the morning before infusion and 2 the evening of along with some smooth move tea) and have had BMs yesterday and today. So the 2 Senekot S in the morning and evening seem to be about right to keep me as regular as possible. Yesterday my hair started coming out by the handful. I'm letting my almost 16 year old daughter buzz it (with probably a mohawk and pink tips) tomorrow. I've been building my collection of hats, scarves, do-rags, and skullcaps for the last few months and have a great selection to carry me through the summer and most of the fall. I've bought most from local thrift stores for very inexpensive. I have a huge Value Village with a great selection of headwear close to where I go every other weekend and I found a great inexpensive on-line place for do-rags; wholesaleforeveryone.com . I got 4 cotton do-rags and 6 of the nylon du-rags with the long tails shipped to me (in Canada) for about $20. I had previously gotten one cotton do-rag very similar and the same brand as one of the ones on-line from a store near me for $7.85. The quality of the cotton ones is the same as the store bought one and the nylon ones are very lightweight and ok quality. I do like the lightweight and found that I can double them up and do some nice braids with the long tails. They should all be good in the summer. I got my package about a week and a half after I ordered it and the shipping was only $1.10. Anyway, I would recommend them if anyone is looking for some inexpensive do-rags! I need to be more active on the board here, because there are so many of you I want to respond to. I've been reading, but just procrastinating about the responses, so here goes; Julie (lulu2533); Wow! $35k for Neulasta is crazy! I have heard insurance companies getting charged u to $9k but never as much as that. In Canada it seems to go for $2500-3000 and the Neupogen is about $200 per vial. I had 7 of the Neuogen for round #1 and as far as I know that's still the plan for round #2. My Neutrophils (baby whites) were low (1.29) on Wednesday, but high enough for me to get treatment. I'm a little concerned for the next time because My regular infusion day (Wednesday) will be on Canada Day (July 1) so they want me to do my blood work on Monday and infusion on Tuesday. I hope my baby whites will be good enough by then. I am already taking probiotics and a good prenatal (for the added iron and folic acid) vitamin and mineral supplement. I will eat more brazil nuts (for the selenium) and spinach and other leafy greens (zinc, folic acid) and garlic to see if I can help them along more. Steph (TheyCallMeCommodorable); I've started dose dense AC/T on June 3rd and have been working my regular schedule of part-time residential housecleaning during my treatment. My infusions are Wednesdays and I've been good for the Thursday and Friday with the anti-nausea meds and steroids and after my weekend low, the next week and a half was good as well. I've been lucky and so far have had no bone pain from the Neupogen. I hope you had a good diner and relaxing eve w/ your hubby and that your first infusion went well. Theresa (Italychick); Thanks so much for chiming in with your experiences. I've been reading your March Chemo thread and you've been an inspiration to me with all the biking you've been doing. I ride my bike to work once a week and that plus the moderate activity of my job and staying really well hydrated have been good to keep my side effects low I think. DayLily15; My hair started coming out by the handful on day 16 (yesterday), so just about the same as you. I think enough will hang on for the buzz and to keep the mohawk or whatever dd decides for a little while. A lady I know locally here who is a few weeks ahead of my chemo schedule still has quite a bit of hair, but pretty much only the white ones. I hear you on the rant about constipation/diarrhea (it sure is a fine balance... I've had BMs with a range of 2 to 6 on the Bristol Stool Chart i the same BM!) and about the looking like a cancer patient thing. I started off wearing rosthesis, but have been flat and fabulous all the time since early May. I'm loving not wearing a bra in the summer. I doubt if I'll wear a wig more than a handful of times (maybe only once or twice when I decide to put on foobs and make-up to match) Brightsideplease; I had to lol about your visions of hair falling out at your husband's reunion. Mine has been hanging on unless I give it a tug, and even then not all the hairs I tug come out at once. My dd is worried it will all come off as she's buzzing it. I told her some would, but not all. The buzz will still be worthwhile.",

I also put on some really good moisturizing lotion. This morning they felt much better. I called my MO and the local cancer centre nurses. The nurse stressed that keeping things moisturized with lotion was very important. My MO said it was ok to supplement with extra vitamin B6, so I'll be starting that soon. I also plan to ice my hands and feet starting at my next chemo. I want to do it for the Taxol anyway to help with possible peripheral neuropathy, so starting one treatment early at my 4th AC is no big change. I was able to ride my bike and work for 4 hours today. I'm sitting down now with my feet on ice. I'm so glad the Claritin worked for you MariaTeresa and that your second chemo was not worse than the first. Yay for sleep! 12 hours is good. Your body knows what it needs to recover. Welcome Mel2015! I'm not sure about the manicure. I was told it's probably ok, but best if you bring your own sterilized tools and make sure the technician knows to be very careful.

I still have fatigue and a few other side effects, but looking forward of a week of more or less new normal until my 4th ad last AC on Wednesday next week. I decided to turn my kiwi head into a true bald and took my husband's electric razor to my head on Sunday. It feels a little stubbly still, but better than 1/8\" long spikes sticking up everywhere. I developed a new side effect on Sunday as well. My feet hurt. The bottoms of my feet, mostly at the heels and outside edges hurt when I walk. It's sort of a burning feeling pain. Also, the toenail on my right little toe hurts. It has a fungus in the toenail and so it's super thick and hard and misshapen. I can't cut it with anything. I trimmed all my other toenails as short as possible, but this one I have to use a nail file on. It's still longer than I'd like and it's hurting when it presses against my shoe especially when I walk downhill. Another thing that's happened is that my body and mind seem to be associating anything I eat or drink during the chemo infusion with the poison. As a result, just the thought of the food or drink almost makes me sick to my stomach. I learned from my first infusion and haven't been eating anything during #2 or #3. I still don't want anything to do with prunes or Brazil nuts! Unfortunately, after chemo #3, I am somewhat turned off my electrolyte drink that has been an important part of keeping me well hydrated. I can still drink it, but it's much less appealing than it was before. I think for chemo #4, I will ask for more fluids in my IV and not drink anything during the actual infusion. Justmaximom; I know the feeling of hungry and sick to my stomach at the same time very well! It's quite annoying! I have found an over the counter acid blocker (active ingredient ranitidine) to be helpful. Also, yogurt has been really good for me. I have been starting each day with some yogurt. The probiotics are good for the gut and also help build white blood cells. Sherri (EnigmaticFox); You and I are on the same chemo (dose dense AC) and I had my #3 last week on Tuesday and my #4 will be Wednesday next week. At my last chemo, the nurses were talking with the 3 of us getting the Cyclohosphomide (Cytoxan) about the `wasabi nose`. One of the other ladies also got it. I`m looking forward to photos of your head and head-gear. I`ll have to post a photo of my bald head and do-rags as well. I`ll show you mine if you show me yours. That`s great that you found a local `chemo buddy`. I have a lady near me as well who is going through chemo for the second or third time right now for breast cancer. I got to speak with her a bit today and compare notes. It really is good to share with others who understand what we`re going through. Littletatas; you have a smiley face port placement scars and I have a big smiley face abdomen; my 2 mastectomy scars, belly button, and c-section scar. My port scar is kind of like a sad partial eyebrow and my apendectomy scar is so well healed and faded that it hardly shows. Good luck to all of you going in the chair this week.",

I slept well the last 3 nights and was able to ride my bike and work a few hours as I had planned without any difficulty on Thursday and Friday. I'm giving myself injections of Neupogen since I'm doing dose dense AC and started those yesterday (Friday). I had a bit of constipation but that's under control now. I took my last prescription meds to deal with the nausea last night and have been dealing with a little bit of upset stomach and queasieness today, but it's not too bad. I'm just listening to my body and eating/drinking what sounds good. Soda crackers and ginger ale have been good. I also had a yogurt and some naan. I've been keeping really well hydrated; drinking 3 to 4 liters (100oz+) od non-caffeinated drinks er day. I'm taking minimal vitamins and minerals and adding some Vitamin D and probiotics. Also keeping up the electrolytes. I haven't taken any Claritin yet as I wanted to see how the first cycle went without it. So far, no issues from the Neupogen. I have 5 more injections to go this round. Good luck to all of you starting this week and to those of you who are dealing with SEs from treatment you've already had.",

I'm sure they'll remember to do the same next time so it doesn't happen again. I hope you have a wonderful bike ride today, Theresa! I couldn't imagine keeping my cancer a secret for as long as you did. I'm just too big a blabbermouth and I live in a small community. I went public right away and have found everyone to be super supportive and kind. My clients are all really great and have been flexible with schedule changes and missed days. I have been able to just about keep to my normal schedule. I really find that working and getting out among people helps keep me positive through all this. I haven't even been hiding my flat chest with foobs for over a month, so no need to even pretend with a wig. After reading about all the wonders of coconut oil on the March chemo thread, I went right out and got a big jar! I hope your neuropathy resolves soon and your hair comes back even more beautiful than before. Mine was long before but I got it cut short and donated to make wigs for kids with cancer a couple months ago. I think I'll be keeping it shorter for a while after it grows back. Most have said it makes me look younger. Hi Proverbs35678; glad you chimed in. I know what you mean about the hair loss. It just makes everything that much more real. But we can get through this and come out even stronger. Prayers coming your way too. Great job on all the gardening and tree planting DayLily15! I have found that staying active has really been good to keep my side effects low and aid my recovery from surgery. I expect you've had the same experience. Do you have a large acreage? I live in a little shack on 10+ acres of mostly rocky bluff with about 2-3 acres of bottom land. Do you go back in the chair again on Monday? If so, I wish you all the best and minimal side effects for round #2!  ",

It varies from 5 to 15% grade (I did measure it myself with a gauge because it's steep!) and is pretty long. I ride a recumbent bike so I can't stand up on the pedals. It's all leg presses to get up the hill. I usually stop once to catch my breath for 2 or 3 minutes. I hope to be able to ride at least part way up the hill throughout my chemo. We'll see how I do.",

      "Content": "Sep 13, 2015 01:36AM - edited Sep 13, 2015 02:00AM by eaglemom It's been quite a while since I've posted an update! I've been trying to keep up on reading this thread and a few others, but just been very busy and kept putting off posting. I finished chemo on Thursday the 10th! I, like many others in June, did dose dense AC + T. I gave myself Neupogen injections on days 3-9. I feel a bit guilty because I have had a relatively easy time of it, much easier than many of you. I have been able to keep on working (housecleaning for others) part time throughout my treatment. I did have lots of side effects, but none of them were debilitating. All were more or less manageable. I also found AC quite a bit harder than Taxol. I had no nausea with the Taxol and, other than the Neupogen injections, didn't take any other medications after the infusions. The Benedryl they gave me for pre-meds (50 mg each time) for Taxol really made me feel awful. It made my head really fuzzy and I could hardly talk. I usually had a nice nap for one to 1-1/2 hours during my 3 hour drip. Luckily, by the time the Taxol was done, the effects from the Benedryl had mostly worn off and I was ok to drive myself home (dh was in another vehicle and usually driving behind me in case I had any trouble and dd was riding shotgun). The steroids (Dexamethasone ~ 20 mg) did make it hard to sleep the first night, but it was ok because I usually had the day after treatment off. My worst side effect, by far, was one that I've been told isn't very common for my chemo combo; hand foot syndrome. It first hit me after my 3rd AC. My hands and feet (mostly my feet on AC #3) got swollen, my palms and the soles of my feet turned red like a sunburn, and there was some tingling and quite a bit of pain. I didn't realize what the SE was at first and so for a couple of days walking was quite painful. The swelling made my shoes that are usually pretty roomy very tight. Luckily I wear slippers most of the day (at home and while working) and my feet were tolerable in slippers. Once I realized it was hand foot syndrome, I started applying lotion to my hands and feet several times per day and it got better. I also started icing my feet during AC #4 and they were much better during that cycle. My hands got hit really hard with the SE after Taxol #1 even though I used the frozen gel mittens they had at the treatment centre part of the time. The gel mitts were soooo cold that I had to take my hands out for a few minutes a couple of times at the beginning. The cold, however, only lasted about 45 minutes. During the rest of the infusion, my hands were at room temperature. It was hot outside during the drive home and I think having my hands on the hot steering wheel may have made things worse. My hands got really painful and angry red. Then after a few days, they started peeling; mostly at my calloused areas. There were a couple of iterations of peeling even though I was keeping up on the moisturizing lotion many times a day. I made some modifications to try to keep things from getting as bad during the last 3 Taxol infusions and they must have helped because my hands and feet have been much better. I used a soft-sided, zippered, cooler bag that as just big enough to fit my feet and packed it with blue ice and zipped my feet into it during the whole infusion. I used the frozen gel mittens with some thin knit gloves under them for the first 20-30 minutes, then without the knit gloves until they were no longer cold. After that, I held a piece of blue ice (from the cooler bag) between my hands for the remainder of the treatment. Here's me during T #2 with my whole silly looking set-up;  I also started wearing my bicycle gloves which have some padded leather in the palm area whenever I did anything that might put heat or pressure on my palms such as driving, riding my bike, vacuuming, etc. Also, I made sure to apply fresh lotion each time after getting my hands wet. It's now the end of day 3 and my hands and feet are doing good. I seem to have had quite a bit of energy today, even though it's just a couple of days after my last treatment. I'm not sure whether it's a result of finally being done with chemo or whether the fatigue I've been feeling was mostly still residual fatigue from the AC and it's finally wearing off. I did notice less fatigue from the Taxol. Anyway, I spent the day being quite productive; I finished a batch of plum jam that I started yesterday, I spent a couple hours picking pears, I did a few loads of laundry, some dishes and general cleaning, and I made a tomato pie (thanks March chemo thread). I hope the energy continues and I get back to feeling mostly normal again soon... in time for radiation which I start on October 7th. I wish all of you who have treatments left minimal side effects and no complications.",

We can compare hair growth over the next months. I have no eyelashes left and my eyebrows are continuing to thin. I'm looking forward to those growing back and also my nose hairs so my nose will stop running. I was aiming for tolerably cold for my hands and feet, rosesrx. It seems that was enough for both of us. My fingernails are fine too. I did keep dark, opaque nail polish on them over the last couple months while on Taxol and I also took B6 & 12 and L-Glutamine. My fingernais are a little discolored but I have no neuropathy to speak of either. An occasional tingle that does not last is all I've had. I have lost one toenail and another is lifting but I'm holding it on with a bandaid and some tape until the nail under is formed enough to protect the nail bed. I'm actually kind of happy about losing the toenails because I've been fighting some fungus and I figure this is a good chance to get rid of it for good. I sucked on ice chips while on AC and had no problems with my mouth. I found it too hard to keep up with the ice in my mouth while having the mitts on, so I phased that out. I'm happy to report that my mouth was still fine. I agree that staying active (and well hydrated) probably helped to lessen my overall SEs as well.",

I gave myself the last of 7 Neupogen shots yesterday morning. Other than a little bit of fatigue yesterday evening, I'm just about back to feeling normal. My side effects for round one were pretty mild overall. I was able to work my usual schedule and ride my bike a couple of times without any difficulty. I did rest more at home, but have been able to do all I needed to do. justmaximom; I know what you mean about the port being a pain in the neck. I was surprised at how sore my neck was for the first few days when I tried to move my neck in the wrong direction and especially when I sat up to get out of bed. I was able to drive myself home (with my 15yo dd as co-pilot) after my first infusion but I was a bit tired. The view from your infusion room is beautiful! And they would actually let you do infusions outside? Wow! I would love that. Tikitorch; my dx took just about as long as yours. I had a mammogram and ultrasound that showed nothing conclusive in mid-November, and then finally an MRI on January 30 and biopsy/lumectomy on February 2nd. Only the latter 2 showed IDC. You'll be glad you got the port once it's in. Thanks for posting the letter to your hair. Have you looked into any of the places that will make a hat with bangs from your hair? That might be a special thing to do with it before it falls out. EnigmaticFox; you've got the same regimen I have, starting 2 days after me. I'm giving myself shots of Neupogen and during round one I did 7 shots; from day 3 to day 10. I'm ok with needles and gave my sister who was diabetic a few shots over the years starting when I was 9 years old. I work for myself doing residential housecleaning part-time and also have no sick leave. I begged for Wednesday infusions so I could work through as much of my chemo as possible. On round one, my worst stomach upset was on Saturday and my fatigue was the worst Monday and Tuesday evenings. DayLily; I've had no issues yet with my mouth. I sucked on ice chips during the infusion and don't know if that had anything to do with it or if I've just been lucky. lulu; I had my hair cut short about a month and a half ago and donated it to make wigs for kids with cancer. About next weekend when my hair starts falling out in clumps, I'm going to let my daughter do what she'd like with it. I'd like most of it buzzed to about 1/4\", but I told her she could do a mohawk or colour it some bright shade or whatever she likes. I think the colour is probably ok if you're pretty careful to keep it off the scalp.",

Thanks for all the nice comments about my mohawk It held on for a few days; just a little less than a week. I wore it proudly to my MO appointment and to work for a couple of days. Then on Friday a week ago, it was bugging me so much that I went outside and put my head down and started rubbing and pulling. By the time I was done, my head looked like a badly plucked chicken! I had my daughter buzz what was left to 1/8\". Some of the stubborn white hairs are still hanging in there, but overall I have maybe 20% of my hair left and it's very sparse. My head basically looks like a kiwi! So, it's been do rags out and about for me. I had my blood work for my 3rd AC done on Monday the 29th. I was concerned whether the neutrophils would be good enough since it was only 12 days since AC #2 and the neutrophils were at 1.29 last time. Luckily, this time they were at 1.50 and I was good to go with AC#3 on Tuesday the 30th. My normal day is Wednesday, but Wednesday the 1st was Canada Day so the schedule was adjusted. I've been doing well. I even rode my bike to the hospital for blood work and to meet with the doctor on Monday. On Tuesday, my dd came with me to chemo. Our ferry was overloaded and we weren't able to get our car on. Luckily, we got a ride to the hospital from some friends who had room in their car. On the way back, we just walked to the ferry. It only took half an hour and it was a beautiful day and I was still feeling good. Some of the nurses mentioned that #3 often hits people hard, but I was pleasantly surprised that my #3 seemed to go better than my #2. I never got the headache this time and the upset, queasy stomach was also not as bad. Fatigue has not gone away, but it's manageable. I just take several short naps per day. I've been able to keep working my regular part-time schedule and did ok with all for my dd's 16th birthday sleep-over last weekend. I even got a nice swim in at our lake last Saturday (late in the day and with a swim cap to cover my kiwi head). I've had a harder time drinking my 3 to 4 liters of non-caffeinated fluids per day. My electrolyte drink that I had been drinking just seems to turn me off now. I start feeling a bit sick to my stomach when I just think about drinking it. Herbal tea, ginger ale, root beer, and most juices are still ok. Yogurt has been good, so that's usually what I have first thing in the morning. I can still tolerate most foods and my taste buds seem to be ok as well. I've still been lucky and not had any pain from the Neupogen injections. I have my claritin handy in case that changes. Thanks for the tip about the \"T-Relief\" Charlotte. I'll keep that in mind in case I need it and will pass it on to others who have bone and muscle pain. I love the pictures, littletatas! Yay for the fun mohawk and you look great in your buzz cut! I hope your hair hung in there for your reunion dinner, Brightsideplease. I'm so glad you're feeling mostly better, December, and I hope the drugs keep working for you too keep the SEs at bay. I'm saying some prayers for you lulu (Julie) that your PET scan comes out clear. I know how scary it is when you have a bunch of nodes involved. Try not to worry. You are doing everything you can to get the cancer out of your body.

Sorry about your fever, but it sounds like it settled down for you. 100.4 F or 38 C is the number I was told to watch for and call if it hit. You definitely don't want to take any chances when your immune system is compromised. Hi cloudynight and welcome. I'm glad you're tolerating the treatments so well so far. Welcome sacmom. I had my first treatment June 3rd and my second on the 17th. I am also experiencing fatigue, but I've found that staying as active as possible and keeping well hydrated helps keep it manageable. My fatigue usually kicks in in the early evenings and short power naps have been helping me a bit as well. Zzlady; I'm glad your 2nd AC went better than your first. I had a worse time the evening after my second infusion, but since then I've been better. The upset and \"off\" stomach has not hit me so hard this weekend. And I got the constipation under control from the beginning this time. What worked for me was 2 Senokot S in the mornings and evenings while I was taking the Ondansitron (Zofran?) which is very constipating. I also had some smooth move tea in the evenings the first couple of nights. The fatigue, unfortunately, seems to be a bit cumulative. It sounds like your first treatment went really well too Steph ~ yay! Great job on the exercise and lemon water and I hope you had a wonderful Father's Day BBQ! Yay for mohawks, DayLily! Here's mine complete with red tips (thanks to my almost 16-yo dd);  Welcome Rebecca54. Sorry the steroids are hitting you so hard. If you haven't had too many other side effects, maybe you could ask them to back off on the steroids a little or give you something to counter-effect the negatives? I'm glad you got the constipation under control Brightsideplease. Great job on going to the gym tomorrow! I've been a bit of a slug this weekend and will have to spend hours in the car tomorrow driving home after my RO appointment. Tuesday I go back to work and will get my exercise in then. Good luck to all who are going in the chair tomorrow (Tia123?) and later this week!",

I'm more than one month PFC (post final chemo) now and almost halfway done with my radiation. My eyebrows are still thinning and no sign of new eyelashes or nose hairs yet, but I have peachfuzz! It's very short (maybe not even 1/8 inch and very light coloured so there's no way it would show up on a photo, but I'm happy it's growing. Radiation has been good so far. I'm having 16 treatments and 4000 centiGray (40 Grays) total and as of today have had 7. My skin looks and feels normal. I have no pink even. I've been exercising lots and still staying really well hydrated. I'm also tracking my protein and fruit/veggie intake. So far, so good. I slacked off on putting lotion on my feet for a while and they're peeling a bit. I'm not sure if it's a left-over of the hand foot syndrome or if I have fungus that came back or never really cleared up, but I'm back to moisturizing them regularly again and they seem to be doing better. I would say me energy level is very good; pretty much back to normal. I'll post photos of hair growth as soon as I can take a photo that you can see hair on.",

My mom is a (3 time!) ovarian cancer survivor and her journey has been very difficult. Have you and/or your mother/grandmother had testing for the BRCA gene? Are you located in the US or another country? I'm in Canada and I believe our public health care system covers prophylactic mastectomy and salpingo oophorectomy (ovaries and fallopian tubes) for people who test positive for the BRCA mutation. People in the States could give you more info about what would be covered there but I think a lot depends on what insurance you have.",
