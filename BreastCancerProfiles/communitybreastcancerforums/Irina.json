VZV remains in the system, even after a chickenpox infection has cleared, so if you've ever had the chickenpox, you are at risk to develop shingles. Shingles also tends to appear in people who have medical conditions that keep the immune system from working properly, or in those who receive immunosuppressive drugs. Shingles cannot be spread by coughing, sneezing or casual contact. But one in three people will contract the disease in their lifetime, and the likelihood of getting the disease increases with age. The easiest way to prevent contracting shingles is to get the shingles vaccine. Who Should Get The Shingles Vaccine? Most shingles cases affect those over the age of 60 who have had chickenpox. If you fit this criteria, it is recommended that you get the shingles vaccine. Who Should Not Get The Shingles Vaccine? The CDC advises against receiving the shingles vaccine if you are someone who: Someone with a minor illness, such as a cold, can receive the shingles vaccine. But anyone who is moderately or severely ill should wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.",

This is very long and scary story, I don't won't to remember this time, it's hearts so much, I don't wont cry.. I did my fingerprints for citizenship,now I'm study for exam.  My Himalayan cat has today kittens, after 2 months I can sale them.  Half money I have to give for my landlord and i can have half.
