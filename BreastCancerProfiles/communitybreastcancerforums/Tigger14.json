Breathe deeply My biggest challnege was doing too much...it is okay to do small things but allow yourself this time of rest reflection and rest...did I say rest?Teedy bears in bed were amazing for support...i stole some from my kids :) The surgery is not as bad as i imagined...fear is 50% of pain...so just go with it and take pain tabs...if you are on your own, organising easy meals or getting others to give you meals really helps. Twolumps, i too am seeing this having a brush with cancer rather than being a cancer victim...mine is a different journe to someone who has nodes involved :) And i get to meet all these new peple in a club i never wanted to join, but if it had to be any club, i would rather it be with you...just saying... I did not worry about linen, i sleep with cats, have dogs in the bedroom...the dressing covers the wound well and keeps it clean. No worries... :)  So remember to rest you have your whole life ahead of you to be busy :)",
