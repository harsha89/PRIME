Today I read the Jane Brody article in the science section of the times, and it was all about living with cancer (until there is a cure) keeping it in remission, It mentions a Dr Esteva at the Anderson Center in Houston. I sent a copy to her, which she can read before going for her appointment. Unfortunately I don't live in the same city, and can't go with her but she will take a tape recorder. I will also send her a link to your responses. Thank you so very much.",

She has been unable to see an oncologist to develop a plan of action, because the specialists don't call back to arrange an appointment. She is being given the impression that there is nothing that can be done, except to breath shallow and not laugh because this might cause a collapse of the lung. Log in to post a reply",
