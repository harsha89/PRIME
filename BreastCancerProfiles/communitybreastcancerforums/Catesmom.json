Became pancytopenic and had to have platelets transfused twice.  I now know why people have said they look forward to their week off with this combo!  Extraordinarily fatigued!   Total body aches.  Ugh.   Hopefully the chemo is working!    Interestingly enough, yesterday I was contacted by one of my onc nurses and she said my onc thinks I might be a good candidate for a new study being done at the University Hospital regarding breast cancer vaccination.  She has 3 other patients in the study so far and they seem to be having some positive effects.  I'm meeting with one of their oncs Wednesday to see if I meet criteria.  The scary thing is you have to have a 30 day washout from all chemo prior to starting the study.  I worry about further progression, but if the study works......   Has anybody heard about the vaccination studies?   They are looking for a vaccination to prevent breast cancer, but feel there might be some benefit to us Stage IV gals.  Wouldn't that be marvelous!!!    I know this message is long, but I wanted to catch up.  It is also encouraging to me that so many of you have been doing well on your current treatments!    Kelly",

I was diagnosed in 1989 with HL and had upper mantle radiation. I was diagnosed with BC in January-4 month after a negative mammogram. I found the lump myself. In hidesight all of my docs now tell me that those of us who have had mantle radiation should get breast MRI's because they are much better at diagnosing BC. I am a nurse so I get to pick from the docs I consider the best. I personally decided to have a bilateral mastectomy (cancer only on the right) mostly because I have seen too many women come in 5 years later with cancer on the other side. My PS who I totally respect his opinion said he was most comfortable using tissue expanders in my case because of previous abdominal surgeries and also because I was too thin to get fat from elsewhere. He says after radiation what he worries most about is the skin. I had my surgery in Feb and so far everything is great. The worst thing about tissue expanders is that they are uncomfortable and you feel like you are carrying rocks on your chest. Two friends of mine have had this done and they assure me that once the expanders are replaced with the permanent silicone ones they felt better almost immediately. The down side is you have to leave them in at least 3 months after chemo is completed. At this point now I am finished with my chemo and my PET scan was clear. halleljah! My case was presented to a tumor board and they recommend no radiation for now. Some of the radiation oncologists now say that they aren't completely against localized radiation for those of us who have had rad before. Case by case. Take good care of yourself and best of luck. Whatever you decide it has to be right for you. Also don't forget to eat well- Johns Hopkins just came out with new dietary recommendations- breathe, and it's okay to cry.

I'm in the enviable position of being a recovery nurse so I know all the surgeons and their work. My surgeon and I had talked about this for years and I was actually talking to herabout a preventative mastectomy when I found the lump. She's actually the head of the BC dept at my hospital. For finding a great surgeon I would check with your primary care doc, your hospital-if they have a bc center, and on line ratings. You really need someone who is available and will take the time to teach you about the whole process. I met with everyone prior to surgery including my oncologist. To find her I basically asked my surgeon who she would go to if she were diagnosed with BC. I also knew my PS and yes, he explained all of my options. The 2 surgeries he thought would be the best for me was either the tissue expanders or where they remove fat from the abdomen-like a tummy tuck-and move it to the breast. I didn't have enough fat for that though. He said if the first surgery failed her would send me to another PS who specializes in a kind of surgery where they pull the muscle from the abdomen up to the chest. He said I didn't have enough tissue for the lat-dorsi flap. I've had no problem with the tissue expanders but I will say they have been inflating them slowly and I am not trying to get to a large size-just a B cup. My skin is holding up very well so far. If the decision had been made to give me localized radiation he told me the have to add more saline to that side to account for shinkage of skin w/ rad. Do you have a local breast cancer support center? They may be able to give you more info about your local docs. It's hard to know what to do especially when you don't know any of them. Your surgeon did a real disservice to you by not having you see the oncologist first. As far as PS go-I think you have to listen to their options and try to make an informed decision (as you obviously are). Each person is very different and what may be right for one isn't necessarily right for another. And lifelover-thank you for starting this discussion panel. I know a lot of women with BC but haven't met anyone who had Hogkins too. It throws a different twist on things for sure. I'm not sure of how much rad I received but I was told it was the \"max lifetime dose\". There has been alot of discussion a the tumor board meetings about my case and some of the rad oncologists say they would not give additional rad and some say yes to localized areas-especially to bone areas. I had a suspicious area of my spine which may have been cancer-unsure but it was gone after chemo. if it had lit up on my PET scan almost all of the them said radiate it. They also use much lower doses now. We also need to watch for other kinds of cancer because of rad-skin,toungue,esophagus,lung, and my onc just had me get a total hysterectomy for 2 reasons-rad and my tumor likes estrogen and she couldn't just put me on tamoxifen because I have a clotting disorder and it would be to high of a risk for blood clots. She also had me get a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. I'm not upset about these risks either because I had 20 great years of health before this diagnosis because of the radiation I received. About 5-10 years before my rad treatment a lot of people died from HL because they were still learning how to treat it. I feel very fortunate. A lot of docs I know think they are close to finding a real cure for cancer. The funny thing is- I don't think it's going to be chemo or radiation. I think in 20 years from now people will say \"can you believe they did that!\". For right now it's the best we have. And by the way-for breast reconstruction I've never heard of taking tissue from the thigh but I don't see why not. It's probably a difference in medical practices in other countries. And I feel bad for you that it hurts so much. I hope it improves over time.",

I was going to have a pleurodesis back in January, but when the surgeon got in there I had too much thickening to my pleura so he had to do more work and did a decortication. I've been told that is a lot more painful. A friend of mine had the pleurodesis with talc and he said it hurt, but healed pretty quickly. The worst part are the chest tubes that they keep in for several days. With pain meds they were tolerable. The good thing is that after the surgery I no longer get fluid accumulating on that side. I hope you will do well. I wish I had my surgery earlier after my diagnosis. That's interesting that your fluid tested hormone negative. That happened to me too. It apparently can happen about 10% of the time. My onc did tell me that sometimes they get false negatives on fluid so tissue is the only sure way to tell. I think mine is probably correct because all of the hormone meds stopped working for me too. Take care and I hope everything goes well for you. Kell ",

Have had pleural effusions since that time. My breathing kept progressively getting worse as you're experiencing now. Laying down definitely makes breathing more difficult. The crackles you feel are from the fluid in your lung. I kept dealing with the increasing shortness of breath, and had a lot of fluid in my lung by the time it was drained. The way I read your post you read your own report and haven't talked to your onc about the increasing pleural effusion? I don't know how things work in New Zealand, but I would call my onc's office to update them on the increasing difficulty breathing. Maybe they can see you earlier, or at least give you a little guidance. It very well may be okay to wait until your appointment, but I would leave that decision to them. Unfortunately I don't know how much your general practitioner can do for you, except maybe order a chest x-Ray??? You may need a thoracentesis? If you can't reach your onc to ask them, I would try to call your GP. It's hard for me to give you a great answer, but I personally probably waited too long before complaining about my shortness of breath, and my oxygen saturation got pretty low, and I ended up with a hospital stay. I'm sorry you're going through this. Kelly",

I guess ultimately they know things are going on so I've decided to be as honest as possible-age appropriately.

I found out I had new brain mets 2 weeks ago and had Gamma Knife last Friday. I felt a lot better after talking to the neurosurgeon. I felt lucky to get in so quickly but don't worry about time because he told me you have a little time to get things arranged for the gamma knife, that the mets don't grow that quickly. I had a 9mm tumor in my cerebellum and 5 little other spots, and they zapped all of them. The process is time consuming but gamma knife luckily doesn't affect the healthy, non radiated brain tissue and has been used for 20 years successfully. The down side is, it won't cure the brain cancer (just like other stage 4 mets), but can be repeated multiple times if necessary. They try not to do whole brain radiation unless there are too many spots to treat. The gamma knife itself did not hurt at all, the most uncomfortable part is having a heavy halo on your head for several hours, and having to lay in the MRI -about 45 minutes, then you wait while they plot your treatment, then you go to the gamma knife machine and the time in there varies-mine was 1 hr 15 min. Then I was in recovery for an hour. All told I was there about 7 hours. No headaches or anything afterwards, a few tender spots on my head where they clamped down the crown. Sorry this is such a long message but I felt like knowledge was very helpful to me. My plan now is to have another brain MRI in 3 months, and if needed I'll have another gamma knife. Hopefully not.:). I know you feel like what's the point right now, and I too see the pain in my husband's eyes. It's hard for them too. The good thing is, if you're having trouble with your vision from these small spots, your vision should improve quickly. I no longer am having headaches, so in my viewpoint, that also improves my quality of life. I'm also glad they were found early. The ironic thing is I've said more than once, \"I just don't want brain mets\". I guess ultimately this is just another bump in the roller coaster of stage 4 BC. I also have bone,lung, and liver mets and am on chemo. Unfortunately no chemos go through the blood brain barrier. I'm glad the other mets in your body are stable and doing well. I wish you all the best, and once those buggers are zapped, it does make you feel a little better because something is being done. I'm sorry you're going through this. Kelly ",

The down side from my view point is I would need to have a 30 chemo cleanse before I can go in the study.   I worry about further progression while off tx.   I was diagnosed with new lung pleural mets about 2 months ago.....Is there anybody out there either with info or currently in the study????
