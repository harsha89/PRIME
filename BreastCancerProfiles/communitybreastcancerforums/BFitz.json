I am scared I will not make it and my children will grow up not remembering me, as they are so young (just 3 and 5 years old). I am a single mother and although their father is in their lives, I know he cannot raise them alone. I play such a large role in their upbringing that if I don't beat this I am not sure what their lives will be like. I am new to my diagnoses but not to breast cancer - it runs in my family and my maternal aunt battled it twice and survived. I know I have a battle a head of me and I have hope. Though I still find myself scared of the \"what ifs\". At this moment in my diagnoses I have learned I have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Stage 2, Grade 3 triple negative and all the doctor's keep telling me how aggressive it is. One doctor, the surgeon, told me she is worried and believes I have a 50/50 chance that it has already spread beyond my lymph nodes. Needless to say this only aided in my fears and I have come to the conclusion that I don't like this particular doctor. My oncologist, too, expressed concern that it may have already spread but in a more direct, non-personal way that I respected. My insurance has been playing games, delaying my treatment and pissing me off. Doc wants me to have a CT Scan and PETScan prior to chemo. Her words, \"if it is limited to the breast and nodes, it is treatment and survive. If it has spread further, it is treatment to prolong life\". As one could imagine, I am VERY scared and VERY worried that is has spread further!!! To make matters worse, this cancer is not my only. Approx. a year ago I was diagnosed with cervical cancer of which I am still plagued. Another worry is my lymph nodes were hurting - considerable pain daily which is how I found the lump to begin with - and within the last few days, the pain is gone. Why has the pain gone? The lump is smaller than it was before biopsy and after, it is the smallest since I found it. And it does not hurt. How common is the worry that it has spread beyond the lymph nodes? What are your stories? I need to know that there is light at the end of this tunnel because I am not ready to die. My kids need me to live. Log in to post a reply",

And for the past month+ my port side shoulder is causing major pain. Doc says nothing wrong with port and thinks i pulled a muscle. I think shoulder pissed about port being there. Your thoughts?",

First chemo treatment went well. I am taking notes on how I am feeling everyday and so far today I feel fairly normal. Anyone else hate their port? This thing has been in a week and is driving me nuts! It aches and I swear I can feel the cathedar in my vein which sometimes hurts, often is pressure, and is very uncomfortable.",

When I posted the above, I was on a roller coaster of emotions. I guess I still am. Mostly, I just want to get started with treatment already. I have come to the conclusion that insurance company's suck! My doc wanted me to start chemo this week and my insurance company sat for so long on approvals that I now don't start until next week. It is very frustrating! Tomorrow is my pre-chemo appointment so I imagine I will learn more about what to expect. I get my port on Monday and start chemo on Tuesday. I was told I can't have surgery until after 20 weeks of chemo. I thought I would be more scared of the chemo. Maybe that will change once it actually starts.",
