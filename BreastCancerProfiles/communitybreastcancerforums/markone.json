I will ask my mom's surgeon (he's a general surgeon) more questions first, especially about the option of a minimally-invasive core biopsy. I will also ask my mom's primary physician about getting a second opinion and seeing an oncologist. Your responses are truly appreciated!!! You guys are wonderful.",

But I also worry about putting my mom through extra steps and delaying treatment to end up at the same place with the same surgery options. It feels as if we are racing against time here. We will take to heart all the input here. So, generally, when biopsies are done pre-surgery to obtain a breast cancer diagnosis, what kind of biopsy should be done? Are core biopsies as mentioned above more common and preferred? Will they give us more information to help us make the surgery decision? What's the opinion on need for an open biopsy first (that's the option given by my mom's surgeon if we choose to not proceed with the removal surgery right away)?",

      "Content": "markone wrote: Hello - My 81-year-old mother a few weeks ago discovered a lump in her breast. She went to her primary physician, who suspected that it was cancer and referred her to a surgeon. The surgeon by physical exam also suspected the same, did a fine needle aspiration biopsy in his office and ordered a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. We had an appointment to go over the results today. But the lack of details in the reports is surprising to me - both the fine needle aspiration and the ultrasound report basically conclude that the lump is suspicious of malignancy. There was no definitive diagnosis and no information about the cancer type, grade, etc. The lump is between 2-3cm. The surgeon has given us a choice now to either do an open biopsy first or to immediately proceed with a removal surgery. The surgery choices given are modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with axillary lymph node removal (followed by radiation). We are beyond overwhelmed as to how to proceed. From the discussion with the surgeon, it seems that the type of cancer will not necessarily alter the surgery choice between mastectomy and lumpectomy. The surgery choice appears to be based more on other factors such as risk of needing multiple surgeries (where, with lumpectomy, you have greater chance that the cancer cells might not be completely removed with first surgery); avoiding radiation (with mastectomy if no lymph node invasion found from surgery), avoiding local recurrence (with mastectomy); preserving the breast (lumpectomy); and complication of surgery (mastectomy being a more major surgery than lumpectomy, thus carrying more risk). If the choice is not dependent on type of cancer, does it even make sense to do an open biopsy first? Given my mother's age, I think one major consideration is to avoid as many surgical procedures as possible. So we are leaning towards skipping the open biopsy first if that's not necessary. But I am not sure what we might be missing from skipping that, and whether the information from an open biopsy is in fact necessary before deciding on the surgery option. Thank you in advance for your input. Mark Log in to post a reply",
