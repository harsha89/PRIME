It is my close relative who has just been diagnosed with stage 2 BC(growing rapidly it seems), and since she doesn't know English, I feel I should try to research for her and find out more! Initially we were all shocked because cancer isn't so common where we are from. Hers is just the 5th case of BC I know about, among ALL my relatives and friends. Slowly we are coming to terms with it.Â  I would like to know more regarding treatment....is it a must to do surgery(she was offered lumpectomy)? What will happen if she does not do it? She is terrified of going under the knife and to add to that, her family members are in the same opinion too. I tried to search on something I can share with them regarding the dangers of not getting treatment(they are planning on herbal treatment, I heard), but could not find anything useful. So I thought I should just ask u ladies, since u r the only ppl who might have answers. I am totally clueless and hope I can help that sister soon. Her breast is in pain and it's burning it seems. I worry terribly for her life, but I just want some answers soon so I can advise her(them). They r all oblivious to the seriousness of BC and that's what makes me mad! Pls help! Sincerely, I_feel_for_u",
