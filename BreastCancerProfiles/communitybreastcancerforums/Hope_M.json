A good massage therapist has helped me release pec minor and adhesions in serratus anterior which were compromising lymphatic flow (mine tries to drain over the shoulder in the back now) and movement of the arm.  Also, I now go to an OT who has training in the Chickley method of lymphatic drainage (as well as visceral manipulation and cranial-sacral therapy).  She has helped release some of the radiation fibrosis and much scar tissue.  Finding  a therapist who is hands-on and trained in lots of ways can be a godsend in dealing with the aftermath of radiation and surgery.  You have to find someone who has \"knowledge\" in their hands.  You'll know them when they work on you.  Good luck, everyone!

Lisajo, I don't believe that you should wait the 6 months. DCIS can go invasive. They do not know yet which cases will and which cases are safe, which is why they have to \"overtreat\" it. Perhaps the doctor did not mean DCIS, but \"benign calcifications\"? I would recommend a second opinion at a BREAST center with a specialist. Re: the pain: Although studies show that breast cancer \"doesn't hurt\", the anecdotal truth is that many of us on this site felt pain with our lumps. What you are describing sounds more like infection or perhaps a blocked lymph node and channels. That can happen for LOTS of reasons (like slight dehydration; too much food that irritates your system slightly, like sugar or things you are allergic to; or even a cold) other than cancer. Hope you get a second opinion. Listen to your gut and press on until YOU feel satisfied with the answers. Good luck! Hope M.",

I think that all of the women on these boards who have children, whether young or grown, have had the thoughts and fears that you are faced with now in a very real way.  As a Stage3er myself, with positive nodes, I have considered my death and how it would affect my boys.  Now that they are a bit older, I honestly think that losing their dad would be worse for them than losing me.  Boys need their dad in their teen years.  My husband is a real winner, a nurturer who is devoted to his family. He has worked hard to stay in good communication with all of our boys and he has a great relationship with all of them. Your husband sounds similar.  If life forces him to, your husband will take wonderful care of the boys.  This is piss-poor consolation, I know.

Please keep posting and let us know what your proposed treatment is so that we can help more. Good luck!  I can tell that you are a survivor having gone through this year so far. Hope M.",

It is a self-selected group.  Just listen to your oncologist and ask what the odds of recurrance or metastasis are for your individual case. I was diagnosed at stage 3 as well.  I also had four positive nodes and no family history.  I am now approaching the five year mark (next May) and have remained cancer-free so far.   Why not assume that you, too, will be like me? I know that it is scary.  But you will slowly become more at ease with it all.  You have a lot to learn, and very quickly.  It all seems overwhelming at first.  Hang in there and take a deep breath when you need one. Good luck with it all and keep asking questions-- Hope M. ",

We have a local charity called \"Let There Be Mom\" who works with parents to provide a profession photo shoot with the family and with their children along with scrapbooks and videos.  Perhaps there is such a charity near you, but if not, you could still do a professional photo shoot with the family before you lose your hair, if possible.  The photos are a real gift.

Maybe say something like, \"I appreciate your encouragement, and I will be glad to move on from the chemo, but I need you to understand that in many ways my life will never be the same.  Do you think that you can support me as I adapt emotionally to this?\" Now that I am 6.5 years out and have been reading these boards since 2003, I can say that for some of us, the mindset does indeed move on. We \"get our lives back\", so to speak.  I carry permanent physical discomforts and compromises every day (lymphedema, radiation fibrosis of the pectoral muscle, etc.) that I have to fight with a routine of treatments by occupational and massage therapists and chiropractic care.  But I feel at peace with my new normal, and I am often joyful on a daily basis.

In my experience, you should now be offered a breast MRI of both breasts, expecially if the extent of the tumor is not suggested by the ultrasound and mammogram.  Using the scans, you would decide on the extent of surgery that you want to undergo.  You may need to consult with an oncologist to find out if chemotherapy BEFORE surgery (neoadjuvant treatment) is desirable. Good luck with it all, and keep coming back to us.  I for one would be happy to take a phone call from you, if you just want to ask someone some answers in person.  Just send me a private message via this site, if you want my number.   Hugs, Hope M. ",

Good luck! Hope M.",
