For some reason they put port in her right arm, even though she told them it was her bad side. She not only has a great deal of pain, she now has a very stiff cord going the full length of her arm. Not sure if its an artery or tendon or nerve. she is having ultrasound of her arm today followed by a portagram. Has anyone else had similar problems? I will keep you posted as to the findings. You are all my heroes.",
