My hair started falling out in clumps about 14 days after my first treatment. I finally took the razor to it and am now bald. For the first week of baldness my scalp looked fine. For the last week though I've had this terrible breakout. It looks almost like acne, there are some small whiteheads. It isn't itch or anything. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it normal? Any solutions for helping clearing it up?Â  Thanks for any tips you might have.",
