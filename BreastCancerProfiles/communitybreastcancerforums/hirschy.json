It has just gotten to the point that enough is enough...how many procedures and \"scares\" can you endure. I am grateful that I have not been diagnosed with BC, please do not get me wrong...I just wonder how long I can be \"lucky enough\" to dodge the bullet. I know what BC can do, my sister had it and she is doing good, my sister-in-law had it but lost her battle, she was cancer free for 7 years and had a recurrence and suffered mercilessly for a year and then lost her battle and now one of our closest friends (she is like one of my sisters, known her my whole life)is battling it and has been for four years, it is really bad, and it does not look good for her. It kills me to see what this disease can do. I just don't know if I am that strong. I am amazed at their strength and courage. I think I lose a year off my life for each scare and I think that I need to be more aggressive than not. I was also BRCA negative and I know that is good.(and bad because they still don't know all the genes.) Anyway, I will call my Primary and see if she can be of some help and I will go from there. Thanks again ladies! Chris",

It was also a papilloma. The doctor said they are very common but that they must come out. They also removed some milk ducts behind my nipple. I now have pain in the breast and felt several new lumps. They could not find them on sonos but did find something else that they did a FNA on and it turned out to be Atypical Lobular hyperplasia and I now have to have another excsional biopsy. They do not think that the two are related in any way so try to think positive. It is very scary, especially when you tell the doctor that you have a cloudy discharge and when she tries to express it it comes up bloody all of the sudden. The waiting for me is always the worst part. They found this new one in November and I won't have the surgery until Feb 1. You can go crazy. Try to throw yourself into other things and forget about it. You are doing all that you can and you have to know that. I wish you luck and will keep you in my prayers. You can pm or e-mail me if you would like. Take care. Chris",

I have read up about it on-line and think that it may be beneficial for me to have one done since my breast are extremely fibrocystic and are quite large (natural EE)LOL! I think it would make my decision easier if I have all the information necessary to make an educated choice. Before I make myself nuts trying to get this done I thought I would ask your opinion ladies...you are all very educated in these things! The place is over two hours from me in NJ, I am in NY. (not a problem since we drive all over the country to see doctors and specialists) and am not sure if insurance would cover it, although again that is not an issue because if it means peace of mind then it is priceless. Just wanted some of your thoughts...thanks again ladies! Chris Log in to post a reply",

My only diffinitive diagnosis so far has been Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia. I saw the breast surgeon for the first time since she did my surgery in February (have seen her Nurse Practitioner every time since) and we discussed my options. She feels I should start with a breast reduction and go from there. My feeling is (and I have thought about it for a very long time, at least 4 years) is that I have a prophylactic double w/immediate reconstruction. My issue is this...not only do I need to make a decision on my breast but I also need to have my thyroid removed and I have a fibroid on my uterus that is the size of an orange and growing rapidly. The fibroid has begun to cause issues, bladder infections, extreme cramps, excruciating leg and back pain. So I am literally not sure which way is up! Anyone have any advice. I sure could use some. My one sister was diagnosed with cancer 3 years ago and I have been dealing with breast issues for almost 20 years, last year having over 25 procedures including the removal of 2 lumps and my milk ducts. My other sister was told she needs a lump removed because she has \"flat epitheliac cells with atypia\" or something to that effect. It was a very long diagnosis and bottom line...precancerous. So far everything they have removed from my breast has been precancerous! I know I am rambling, but I really am confused. Thanks for listening! Hirschy Log in to post a reply",

ShirlAnn is right, I do need a case manager because while 2 out of the three doctors work in the same hospital, I doubt that they get together and discuss common patients. I have a great deal of experience with multiple doctors w/ my daughter but thankfully all her docs communicate to each other. My other issue is that I need to make some decisions soon because my husband needs double hernia surgery (he has a myriad of health issues as does my daughter-undiagnosed since birth 42 and 13 years)and I was planning on starting an LPN (full time nursing)program in September. I'll keep you all posted. Thanks again, Chris",

I have swollen lymph nodes under my arm with extra breast tissue and it makes me nuts. I have had it for a good ten years. The breast surgeon finally wanted a biopsy but the radiologist did not think it was warranted. Figure that one out. So my suggestion to you is to be diligent and insist that they do the biopsy. It will give you peace of mind. Next time I go in I am insisting...it has been too long and sometimes I think they wait for trouble! Good luck and your in my prayers. HIrschy",
