Haven't had any \"peer interaction,\" so it feels good to be back (so to speak!).  It sounds like some others here are on Tamoxifen (or aromatase in.) as monotherapy. I have mets to the lungs, and began taking Tamoxifen again when mets was dx 8 mos ago. I had previously taken Tamoxifen for almost 2 yrs after initial tx, but discontinued d/t major side effects, including early uterine cancer (treated successfully w/surgery only). My oncologist intended to start me on an aromatase inhibiter, but we didn't start as I was seriously ill (autoimmune disease++), and there was no sign of cancer.(Better on that front at the moment, btw!)  So... I ended up with no preventative tx for about a year before lung mets was discovered. I stayed stable on the Tamoxifen for 4 mos and then at 6 mos had slight improvement.. I am due for another CT soon. I have 2 MD friends who keep pushing me to ask about more agressive treatment (we may be starting Herceptin again anyway...). I'd love to know if anyone else is on hormonal therapy alone (or HT+Herceptin!). Many thanks! ",

How much longer do you have to take it? It sounds like the Tamoxifen kept your cancer stable for 5 months, but are you taking an aromatase inhibitor now (and/or other tx)? I'm wondering if you and/or others are staying stable (or improving) on hormone therapy alone (or with hormone therapy+Herceptin)?",
