I did end with a very thin spot that could be disguised a bit with a scarve rolled as a headband. I think that lasted for maybe 3 weeks and then growth began to cover. Ionce shedding stopped I did change to a short style as there wasn't enough hair to wear it down. It was very scraggly. Your hair looks to be in much better shape than mine did. I'm still so glad i used the caps as no one was able to quite tell and I quickly felt a normalcy in appearance Hang tight shedding will stop soon",

I am starting to notice a wheezing type cough or \"catch\" that sounds like a tad bit of fluid when I cough or occasionally talk or laugh. I don't necessarily feel breathless. How slow did symptoms come on for each of you. Terribly afraid to think about this being lung mets or start investigating. My life has just returned to normal. I see the oncologist's nurse practitioner at end of July I appreciate any insight.",

I've heard hydration is key so I'll return to the 3 liters of water per day. Wishing each of you lovely, strong women good health.  ",

Noticing lower back pain and wondering if I'm absolutely crazy for fearing it could be mets after such a short time period. Onco's office has suggested I stay as active as possible and try to track patterns and whether pain is getting progressively worse. Anyone diagnosed so quickly after active treatment?",

I am considering cold caps as an option to keep my own hair but also found a shop in Chicago that seems to specialize in wigs for cancer patients - looks very high end.  I suspect my vanity may drive me to the $$$ options!  Maybe you can find something similar in your area?  Also found a discussion here regarding wigs that many have shared brands or website.  Like you, I feel like the surgery and the TEs are a breeze in comparison to what is now to come.  I really do need to learn/practice some meditation. ",

I suspect I'll learn about drawing on eyebrows! Wampuscat - you have such a wonderful, happy event to look forward to this summer.  Congratulations - how lovely. How many children do you have?  First child's wedding?  Is the wedding local?  I have scheduled a vacation in early June with my husband and grown daughter and am still holding out hope I'll be well enough to travel. Blueberry - how is the weather in Dallas?  I'm outside Chicago and except for one day in the 50s, we still await spring.  How are you adjusting to the TEs?  I'm 10 days post op and finding the pain from stretching worse now than last week and the armpits much more \"lumpy\" feeling.  Worried about about how to wear normal clothes again with the TEs for return to work April 8.  Once final two drains are removed, I think I might shop for camisoles to wear, I can't imagine trying to wear any bra quite yet. Thanks for the company ladies - I hope you both have wonderful weekends as you continue to heal and gear up for the next part of the journey.",

I know I will find resolve and my \"sea legs\" but it may need to wait until tomorrow.  So grateful for all of you and those that have traveled the path before and that lend support.  Truly remarkable women.",

I am feeling much the same way.  First meeting with MO and RO has left me overwhelmed and sad, very teary the last 24 hours.  I wonder if I have what it takes to do this and how to muster the resolve to forge ahead.  This morning I'm not feeling my body or mind can handle it.  Know I'll find it though as no action is not an option - too much at stake.  A fellow BCO member shared with me that \"you don't have to be strong, you just have to show up.\"  I suspect some days that might be all I can cover. I am already finding I rely so much on all the women here and their shared experience.  I hope your class helps allieviate the anxiety and helps you feel that you're doing all you need to in order to have many, many healthy tomorrows.  Keep us updated - let's do this!",
