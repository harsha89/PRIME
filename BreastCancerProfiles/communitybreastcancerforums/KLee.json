It has gotten to the point where my right kidney is so bad that they may have to leave a tube coming out of my kidney that will drain into a urine bag. I am hoping this is not the case, but they won't know until they get in there. I am pretty nervous about this,because I don't want to feel any pain. I think the worst part will be when they give me the local anesthesia, that has to go pretty deep in to the kidney. This is a very sensitive area for me, as I have tumors all over my chest wall, very close to this area. I am just a wreck thinking about this. Normally speaking, I am by no means a wimp, and have a high tolerance for pain, but I can't help remembering when I had my surgery to remove my old portacath, and have a new one replaced only 2 months ago. The nurse was supposed to give me some IV sedation, and she did not...so, needless to say, I felt the whole thing, and it was pretty uncomfortable. I am also concerned that this surgery site will easily become infected, as I am currently undergoing chemo treatments with Taxotere. I wish I did not have to deal with this because I am dealing with enough problems right now. Of course, I do not have a choice-if I don't do this, I risk kidney failure. The doctors can't really even tell me what has caused all this, but the urologist thinks it may be to long term chemotherapy, not to mention all the enormous amount of drugs I have been on in the past 17 years. Any words of advice, or has anyone else been thru this with kidney stents?? Dx 11/1999, 1cm, Stage IV, 2/20 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I must relay my experience from friday...I went in to the one day surgery section at my local hospital, as scheduled early fri. morning. Needless to say, I was not happy to be there. I looked up on their surgery schedule board, noticed my name, with the surgery, and the Dr. who would be doing the surgery. To my astonishment, it was not my Urologist, but the surgeon I had 2 months previous from Interventional Radiology, that had removed/inserted my porta-cath. When I had that surgery done 2 months ago, it was not the greatest experience. I was totally awake, with nothing for pain, except the local injection. I was advised, and made sure that I would have something for pain thru my IV (Fentanyl). This is my 3rd placement of a porta-cath, so, nothing new. When the wheeled me into the radiology room, the nurse was on her cell phone, on a personal phone call with her husband-she had found out she received a job promotion, and was very excited. In her excitement, she forgot to administer the fentanyl thru my IV. I was fine for the first half of the procedure, but the second half, it started to get quite uncomfortable. The Dr. knew this, as I was squirming all over the table, didn't say anything to the nurse...until I finally did. She had given me some fentanyl, and I swear, 2 min. later, the surgery was done, I had felt the whole thing. Needless to say, I was not too happy. I should not have to deal with pain from any surgery's or tests, because I deal with alot of different pain on a day to day basis. I knew going in that I would have a local injection, very deep into the kidney, which I was very paranoid about. Mostly because I have a large scar with major scar tissue and cancer tumors on the outside of my chest wall, all very close to the kidny area, and it is very sensitive and I often get pain there. I was told I would get \"mild IV sedation\", and this just did not sit right with me. I couldn't help thinking like \"yeah right, just like last time\". I kinda started mildly freaking out, and told the nurses there that I was having 2nd thoughts, and probably would not be having that surgery done that day, until I had more answers about the surgery and the bad condition of my kidneys, and I wanted to make sure that I would not feel any pain.I have heard that this can be painful, even one of the nurses told me so, and was wondering why this was not scheduled for general anesthesia. I don't think my husband was too thrilled, nor were the nurses, because I put up a stink ( I didn't get loud or obnoxious), and had thrown off all their schedules... I say, tough!! I've always had great instincts and good common sense (for the most part), especially when it comes to my health, I've been doing this for 17 years! The crazy thing is, they wanted to try and put the stent in my right kidney, but with most liklihood I would end up with a neph. tube and urine bag - and then 2 weeks later, the same thing for my left kidney. This does not make much sense to me, I'm just wondering, does any of this make any sense to you, and do you think I was out of hand, by not wanting to be in pain with this surgery? I am still in the same dilemma, as time goes on, my kidneys are worse, ( the right one is functioning at about 20%-and the left at about 50%) and I must get this done ASAP. I did make another appt. with my Urologist to see what the heck is going on.",

I was doing pretty bad last week and could not breath well at all. I pretty much knew that my pleura was filling up with fluid fast. Well, last friday, I went into the lung Dr.'s office, and she drained 1 liter of fluid off my lung in about 10 min. time. It really wasn't painful, and was so totally different than what some other dr>'s put me through 10 years ago, which was a nightmare - and the more I think about it now, the more it pisses me off. Anyways, it was a big relief. I am breathing better now, but still have alot of coughing and shortness of breath. Of course this could fill right back up with fluid again. My onco. thinks that now maybe we should change my chemo from taxotere to taxol. Has anyone here had any sucess with taxol? This friday I finally get to have my kidney surgery, not that I've ever been looking forward to it. In meeting with my Urologist again in the past month, he told me that my right kidney is pretty much gone, and that now I need to concentrate on my left kidney, because that has not been functioning well either. I also found out that they will not be placing a stent, but instead will be putting in a neph tube, with it hanging out of my back (about 1 inch lower than my lung thoracentesis)connected to my LOVELY urine bag that will now be accompanying me wherever I may go.

I had been putting this off for about 6 months, and have been dealing with other medical issues as well. Last month I found out that we would not even bother doing anything with the right kidney, as that is barely functioning (10%). I had been putting this off mainly out of fear, the fear of pain...now I can see why. When I was in on friday, I almost walked out (again)asking myself why would I put myself through kidney pain, when I don't have any now, and also why would I want to walk around with a urine bag attached to me? I had to do alot of convincing just to get them to make sure I was out of it during the procedure, which they did. My Onco. was even wanting to give me a chemo tx on friday, after I had already been thru this - I told him no thanks. When I got home friday, the pain was unbearable, even when on continuos pain meds. It has gotten somewhat better in the last few days, but am still on plenty of pain meds, and hoping the pain will lessen in time, but I'm not sure. Every time I urinate now-its painful. Not to mention, now I have to go in every 6 weeks to have this tube changed, although they have told me it will be nothing like it was on friday. Its been a rough couple of weeks for me, as the friday before last, I had to have my lung drained of fluid, and am hoping it will not return. Its hard tho, because I have been very short of breath for awhile. Anyways...now my Onco. wants to change my chemo from Taxotere to Taxol, this week, and then next week add Cytoxin to the mix. I am somewhat unsure of this. I asked him about Abraxane, as I've heard it may be easier to tolerate than Taxol. One of my problems is the hair loss, which I know is trivial in the whole picture, but it seems to be my only saving grace right now as far as not looking totally SICK. I have had continuos hair loss with Taxotere, it comes out in handfuls all day long, and it drives me nuts. However, I still do have some of my hair, and i\"d like to keep it that way. I just don't want to end up totally bald, with no chance of ever being able to grow my hair back again. We are not even sure if the Taxotere was even working either. Sometimes lately, I can't help thinking that nothing is going to work for me, at least not like we had hoped. My Onco. told me that insurance does not like to pay for Abraxane, when they can use Taxol/Taxotere instead - does anyone know about this. HUGS to all of you.",

My largest problem at the moment is the breathing. I've had a small effusion on my left lung for some time now, but I'm sure it has increased dramatically in the past week. I had a chest x-ray last thurs., and not sure what it says. All I know is I may have to go to the ER soon for oxygen, and I'm sure to drain this effusion. I am scared to death of this, as I have been thru this nightmare 10 years ago, and I have to say it was torture...the worst thing i have been thru in my 17 years of BC. I know one of the S.E. of Taxo. is pleural effusion. Other than this, being tired alot, and having no appetite, I am still tolerating the Taxo. fairly well. I usually get scans every 6 months, or more as needed. Even though I usually manage about 5 crappy days out of 7, I still live for the 1 or 2 decent days a week I have, and will continue to think that even that is good and still worth it, because I know it is. Quality of life is always important, and I have done a pretty good job with this for quite awhile. Funny thing is my Onco. told my DH a few moths ago that as far as \"quality of life\" goes, he said we are not there yet. I love my Onco., and we know each other well after 9 years, but I had to tell him that anyone who is stage IV is always thinking about and trying to find and keep the ways of having the best quality of life. I had to make him understand that it is not just about when you are on your deathbed, it is about EVERY DAY. My DH helps out sometimes, but is usually so exhausted himself every day its difficult for him. We've been together for 30 years, and he has been thru this long journey with me pretty much every step of the way...until lately. He says he feels helpless, and doesn't know what to do. Sounds like a sorry ass excuse to me, because HE is tired-what does he think I am? He's always been a workaholic, and has been able to somewhat hide away from my stage IV for the past 10 years. Now, he has been acting like gee, how come your cancer got this bad so fast?? He is always miserable (he used to be a happy person) and makes me feel aweful. He's told me that he feels sorry for me, and he feels pity, I say its much more like GUILT, for all the years he was never around because he was working. He was always my best friend, we don't even have that anymore. I guess all the tough years have more than worn out their welcome. You all had some great responses, and I really appreciate them. HUGS to all!",

It is possible for your wife to have Ovarian cancer, as it is similiar to Breast ca.. I have had mets to my bones for the past 10 years, and I can say that sometimes you can be totally asymptomatic, with no bone pain. I would keep up on the tumor markers, and CT, MRI or pet scans, and bone scans maybe every 6 months or more for now. How long ago was your wife doing chemo.? I agree that more clarity needs to come from the pathology reports. Good luck to you & your wife. Hang in there and hopefully you will receive better answers soon. It's nice that you are so involved, and an excellant advocate for your wife!",
