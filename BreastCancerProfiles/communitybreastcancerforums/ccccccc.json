      "Content": "ccccccc wrote: Hi, I'm so glad I found this site. I found a lump about 4 weeks ago, feels approx. 1\" in diameter. My doctor said to keep an eye on it until my next sugar pills since I don't menstruate (haven't in three years yay!) My husband and I agreed that it was getting bigger so I went in again yesterday and saw a different clinician. I'm glad to say that I have an ultrasound scheduled for next Monday. The doctor felt that it is most likely fibrocystic changes because of my age (29) and because it blends in with some of my normal breast tissue. I guess my concerns are that although it somewhat blends in, it doesn't just feel like thick tissue to me... it feels harder and edgier (non-painful, just annoying). Also I don't have anything else like it - I've never had anything that resembled a lump other than when I was breastfeeding. Next, I don't have a period even though I'm on the pill due to another medication I take. And... my understanding is that fibrocystic changes lessen after a period, in my case sugar pills, but my \"lump\" got bigger. One last thought... it could just be my imagination but it seems like one of my lymph nodes under that arm is swollen. So now I will join in the waiting game and pray that it's nothing.

      "Content": "ccccccc wrote: Hi I went into Urgent care because my doctor didn't even call me back about my concerns. They decided to do a chest xray to look at lymph nodes in my chest. The doctor said he didn't see any... I asked him if the ones under my arm pit and above my collar bone showed up and he said no... that in the center of the chest there is an area that shows expansion if there are swollen nodes there. And that expansion is not happening in my chest. Which is a good thing. I really don't know what to think of this. I thought they could see the lymph nodes in xrays? Kind of confusing. He did say the one under my armpit was larger that he would expect and to come back in if it doesn't go down in 2 or 3 months. I guess they're taking the results of the ultrasound at face value ( nothing there must mean nothing there) and treating my symptoms as completely separate from my lump. Doesn't it seem that way to you guys? I also got a rx for lorazepam until everything gets figured out. What would you do if you were me? Stop worrying / pursuing it now that an ultrasound and Chest xray came back clean? Is that enough? Or what.. I don't know how to stop worrying. Log in to post a reply",

My other breast is so unlumpy, unthick that you can feel my ribs through the tissue. Why does everyone keep telling me that it feels like normal breast tissue.... I feel like screaming \"how can that feel like normal breast tissue? don't you feel the difference?!!!\" it is NOT normal for my breasts, not only that but it has changed so quickly from under 1\" to over three\" in less than 2 months. She said she cannot biopsy the breast tissue because she can't feel a palpable mass... again I wanted to scream \"the whole damn thing is a mass!\" The surgeon also said my supraclavicular node felt benign. Which is nice to hear but then again she doesn't think any thing's wrong with my breast. Am I being ridiculous and blowing this out of proportion? This is now my doc, an urgent care doc, another doc in my docs office and a surgeon who aren't concerned. And did I mention when examining my breasts the surgeon was so rough even my \"good\" breast hurt. I sure as hell don't want her cutting into me! On a lighter note I am now scheduled for another ultrasound as well as a mammo tomorrow. Rant Over Sigh... Log in to post a reply",

Which I found it does. My \"lump\"/ thickening is now taking up over 1/4 (almost 1/2) of my breast which seems slightly swollen and is slightly more warm to the touch than the other. My anti anxiety pills don't work unless I take 3 and I'm only supposed to take 1/2 to 1 twice a day. So of course I'm almost out. And I have 5 days until my consult and then who knows about the wait after that for the biopsy. I read about the low survival rates w/ IBC and that it is normally not found until stage 3b or 4. I'm so scared. I have an 8 year old daughter and do not want her to loose me. I lost my parents when I was young and never want her to endure that pain. And about the biopsy... will it be enough for them just to biopsy the lymph node or should I ask them to core needle biopsy the breast? I mean, if it's cancer can the lymph nodes swell even w/ out cancer in them? And if so then biopsying one and finding it to be cancer free may not rule out cancer in the breast, right?

I talked to my doctor about the multiple swollen nodes under my armpit and they said to let them know if I started running a fever (sign of infection) but that it was nothing to worry about. They also eased my mind about my weight loss (14 lbs since January) agreeing that it is probably due to a medication I discontinued. So I was all ready to let all my concerns go. But tonight sparked my concerns all over again when I found yet another swollen lymph node... this one is about half an inch above my collar bone. I talked to a nurse who asked if I did monthly exams and if I had noticed any lumps. I told her about the ultrasound and that it came up fine. She said I should call the doctor about it on Monday and that it needed to be looked at. Doing a search online (of course) I read that swollen nodes in that area are almost always a sign of tumor or infection in the chest/ breast area. I'd like to think infection but have no other symptoms. What do you think? Am I over reacting? I don't know if I can go through all the waiting and worrying again. It was terrible. Please talk to me.
