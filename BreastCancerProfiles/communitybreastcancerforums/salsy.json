Found a large lump (last year) 5cms in left breast while in shower, mammogram and scan identified it as B9 cyst with swirling internal echoes - surgeon palpitated area 6months later as part of follow up and found nothing  - requested mammogram at age 40. 1 year on, i have terribly painful fibrocystic breasts again. Found soft lump in left breast, doctor doesnt think anything suspicious, no glands or other issues, however she wants to see me after my cycle as she noted there is an area of concern. Issue is that my left breast has recently bcome at least half a cup size bigger than the other, the nipple area is slightly redder also, im beside myself with worry as Ive read that a single larger breast is an indicator of BC and possibly advanced tumor.  My question, could fibrocystic breasts, or the cysts themselves cause the left breast to have become larger.. ?  Any ideas?
