I had the lumpectomy 6 weeks prior so this surgery was by itself.  3 nodes were removed and all were neg.  I was swollen and in pain for the first 3 days or so.  Then I backed off to just Tylenol for pain and did ok the next 3 days.  About the 6th day after surgery the numbness across my back (shoulder blade area) and shoulder wore off and the area hurt.  If you touched it, no matter how light it felt severely bruised.  I looked at it in the mirror and saw nothing.  There was very mild swelling but that could have been my imagination because my husband didn't see it.  The surgery area was still swollen which I expected.  I went for a 1 week follow up to the doctor and she said I may need to have a seroma drained.  I wish she would have drained it then now that I have been through this but didn't know at the time.  As the overall swelling went down, the giant egg remained and hurt.  My breast on the outside also starting hurting and my back continued to be very painful.  My breast was almost a full cup size bigger.  By day 9 I was taking 4 Advil every 6 hours and getting no relief from it.  So on day 13 I had the seroma drained.  There was 20 cc's.  I immediately felt better since I could now put my arm down at my side.  The next day it filled right back up and I didn't call the dr. since I was busy at work.  I found a tight camisole that came up high under the arm and wore that for 3 days straight.  The large painful area across my back started to shrink to a smaller area and the seroma filled up a little less each day.  Most mornings it was almost gone.  On day 20 I went back and had it drained again since it hurt to put my arm at my side and I had stopped wearing the camisole.  She drained only 5 cc's but it made a huge difference since now it didn't hurt and I could put my arm down.  I wore the camisole days 21 and 22 but then didn't on 23 and 24 and did fine those days without pain.  Day 25 the pain was back but the amount of fluid in the seroma I'm sure is less than 5 cc's.  I could feel an area of pain and heaviness on my back by my armpit and down the back of my arm.  I wore the camisole yesterday and today and the pain area goes away except for a very small area of the seroma (like the size of a penny rather than an egg).  My breast is nearly normal sized now but it is still painful on the outside edge.  So my question is, do I have truncal lymphedema or is this all normal 3 1/2 weeks after surgery and I'm just impatient.  I know many of did not have sentinel node surgery by itself so your recovery was probably expected to be longer than mine, but for some reason I thought after 2 weeks I should be back to 90% normal.  My doctor doesn't seem concerned and doesn't seem to believe me about the back pain. She said maybe I pulled a muscle.  But that's not possible since I hardly use that arm.  Also, I started radiation last week so I would love to be done with this pain so I can move on to radiation pain.  Thanks for any advice you can give me!",

She said to keep as much Aquaphor on it as I can over the weekends. susantm - thanks so much for sharing that you are nearly finished and not burning.  I so hope to join you! Barbcard2 - I feel that I am having a similar experience as you.  I don't know what to do with all of the emotions.  No one prepared me for this experience - they just scheduled it and got started.  I am really having trouble with it emotionally.  Then I ask a question and am made to feel stupid or that there is something wrong with me.  I wish I could just send my breast and keep my brain at home.   Anyone getting Tomotherapy? I chose this since there are only 20 treatments and I knew going each day would be rough on me since I hate even walking into medical places and I am working full time.  I think the actual treatment experience is longer - I can't stand laying there not moving for so long in additional to being exposed and there seems to be airhandling system developed from a jet engine that pushes tons of air over me freezing me to death.  There are no tatoos, just lots of marks with a special marker (3 down each side and three down the middle) then covered with clear stickers. ",

I've got just 2 boost treatments left.  I feel like my experience has been so different since I had tomotherapy so I want to share it in case others to follow search these pages for information.  First, I didn't get tatoos.  I have marker lines all over me.  3 down each side - armpit, breast, waist and 3 down the middle.  Each is covered with a clear sticker.  The lotion causes them to fall off about every 4 days so they remark me and resticker.  2 of the stickers have a plastic ball on them like the end of the strait pin that is used by the CT scanner.  I had a total of 16 full breast treatments with the same total radiation as traditional, but just more in each treatment.  I have 4 boost treatments.  Each treatment starts with a 3 minute CT scan and that is used to align to the original and the table makes little adjustments after the comparison.  I hate waiting for the comparison which can take 3 minutes or one time 15 minutes.  Then the treatment is 15 minutes.  Now the boosts are only 6 minutes which is so much better.  Every morning I use Biafine and then at 10, 1 and 5 I use Miaderm.  At night I squeeze a two inch line of Aquaphor on my fingers and then add a tablespoon of castor oil and mix and rub in really well.  I wear a sports bra to bed that is now soaked in the stuff.  I haven't washed it since I started this 3 weeks ago and may burn it in 2 days when I'm done.  After the 10 treatment I started using hydrocortisone cream and then got a prescription cream a few days later but really could have survived without it.  The rash was in the area between the breasts and above the breast.  My breast skin rubbed of 3 times - always Monday's for some reason but never what I would call a peel since it just rubbed off when I was putting on lotion.  I was pink after the 4th treatment.  I have not had any trouble with fatigue.  I have also been taking a protein supplement 1x a day (26 g) due to a seroma that my surgeon said would help.  Maybe this helped fight off fatigue.  I 've also been mall walking at least 2 x a week.  I work full time, but right now about a 6 1/2 hour day due to the treatments.  So knowing that my skin was spared I'd have to say if there is a tomotherapy facility in your city, it would be worth seeing if it is an option for you and covered by insurance.  I pray for you all each day during treatments and hope we can all return to \"normal\" one day very soon.",

I arrived at 1:00 (no eating or drinking since the night before).  I got the IV inserted.  I had the wire localization with ultrasound since that was how they saw the lump after a mammogram.  It was 1.5 cm so it was definitely big enough to feel and find.  I had a numbing shot first, just a pinch.  Then they put in the wire.  No pain, no discomfort.  Then I waited for surgery which was a little behind.  I went back at 3:15 and was awake at 3:50.  I took Vicadin that day and the morning of the next day and by afternoon was just taking Tylenol.  I wore a sports bra to sleep in and a regular bra during the day.  I went back to work on Wednesday but almost could have on Tuesday if I had skipped the pain medicine.  I felt like I had a small water balloon where the lump had been - it sounded like one too sloshing around.  This was significantly less after a week.  When I went back to work I had to remember not to lift anything with my right arm.  The first thing I did on the first day back was lift my laptop bag.  I had not had any Tylenol that day and it took until 3:00 for the aching to stop.  It wasn't really pain, just a terrible ache.  By the weekend I was doing laundry but carrying it carefully and with more weight on the left side. I also found that my breast ached more if I didn't wear the sports bra at night so after going a night without it I wore it for about 10 days - I think because it helped get the fluid out. Hope this helps - hearing other people's experiences has been a great way for me to accept and process things ahead of actually having to go through it.  It seems like such a big deal to those of us who have never had any surgeries - getting my wisdom teeth out when I was 19 was 10 times more painful!",
