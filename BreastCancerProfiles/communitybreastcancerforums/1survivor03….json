I had a double masectomy and went through 4months of chemo. I had reconstruction with implants. This coming Januuary would have been my 5 year makr. But, unfortunately, I was just diagnosed last Thursday with mes in my lungs and lymphnodes in my chest wall. I just started tomxifen today. I go tomorrow to obgyn to discuss having a complete hysterectomy. I am in complete distress. I just celebrated my second wedding anniversary in August. I have a 11 year old son, and I have my special after breast cancer gift, my beautiful 22 month old daughter. If anyone had in words of encouragement or advise I really love to hear from you. May God Bless All!!!",

One day I think I am good and strong and the next I feel weak and don't want to get out of the bed. Thank God for my kids they keep me moving. I hate feeling weak. I Just returned this evening from seeing my OBGYN, I am having a complete hysterectomy this Mon. the 22nd. Hopefully with the removal of my ovaries that will help with my estrogen levels, along with with my tamoxifen. I feel strong rite at this moment, but I am also stressed. Thank you so much and I wish you  the best in your journey. Lots of prayers and hugs I send your way. 1survivor03 ",

The first Dr. I seen said that the one spot on my right lung was 8mm and i have 2 spots on my left lungs 1 is 3mm and the other is 5mm. He said it was to small to biopsy. He wanted me to wait three months and do another ct. I didn't like the idea of that. So changed to Mayo Clinic, my onco there ordered and PET scan then found the spots in my chest. She says that because it's in my lymphnodes it's not currable. So she put me on tomxifen and I am fixing to have my hysterectomy mon removing my ovaries trying to lower my estrogen. My primary care Dr. went to a conference in Gainsville, Fl as I live in FL. She met a Dr. at the University of Florida and she began to explain to him about my case and what Mayo had told me. He now wants to see me and talk to me about doing proton therapy. It's a new thing. It could be an option. Because my spots are so small they don't want to biopsy etc... it just doesn't sit well with me. The after my surgery this week and I heal I am for sure going to check out the proton therapy. Best of luck to you ((((survivor))))",
