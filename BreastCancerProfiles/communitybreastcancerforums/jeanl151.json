I had my first little trim yesterday to get rid of the fuzz!!    For those in the growing phase, enjoy....for those in the beginnings of hair loss, keep the thought it will come back. It is a long rocky road but you will get there!!    Jean",

I have had some different experiences.   If I bump into someone who is not a close friend but someone I have known a long time, they either ask about my health or I mention it.              If it is just someone I am only aquanted with and haven't seen in years, I just smile, say a quick hello and walk away....just keep them guessing!   By doing this I feel like I have some power over my life.  With all these treatments this year I didn't feel any power over anything!!       My hair is about half an inch long and I colored it a couple of weeks ago. I used a root touch up kit because I figured I only have roots. I can see how much has grown in the 2 weeks by how long the grey roots are!    ",

I had a lumpectomy  a few weeks ago and more surgery Wednesday for more lymph nodes and to get clear margins. Now I need to wait for pathology report. If all is clear I will start chemo, if not then probably a mascectomy.   So many questions and worries I have. I am a preschool teacher and worry that it will be too \"germy\" for me to work through chemo.  Does anyone know how long chemo is with triple negative or is it an individual thing?

I was diagnosed in July and found the website in Sept.  I have learned so much. My best advise is search through these threads...I found what these women have written are inspiring and informative.. When it came time for me to talk to the doctors, I actually understood what they were talking about. I also had lumpectory and node removal...moving on to chemo. wishing you the best news possible, Jean",
