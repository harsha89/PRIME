My gynecologist and a nurse practictioner at a large breast center couldn't feel it and thought things felt \"normal\". They did a quickie US last week and it didn't find anything. I had had a mammogram in July that I was told showed an \"asymmetry\" in the left breast- this was b/f I noticed the dimple and lump. A follow-up diagnostic mammo was negative (although now I question that). However I just got my mammograms and copies of the reports since I'm following up with a breast surgeon at a different clinic- found out that the asymmetry they told me about was actually seen and reported as a 15 mm round nodule- and now seeing it on the actual film, it is in the same spot where I feel the lump (which I had estimated at a similar size, and roundish/oval).  I think I may do a separate post about this with some questions I have... I understand what you're going thru. I'm experiencing alot of anxiety about this, feeling like things have just gotten blown off and potential diagnosis delayed. I'm scared of yet another doctor telling me things are \"normal\" and treating me like I'm overreacting, when I know it is not. Like you I'd love to have a B9 diagnosis, but they need to prove it to me before I can move on. I'm planning on begging for an MRI.",

At this point I have very little confidence in my Gyn doctor. I hope he's right, but it makes me upset that he would have just sent me away w/o further investigation if I hadn't let him know how worried I was. It seems like there are way too many delayed diagnosis for women b/c of situations like this that are taken way too casually. Deanna- I did find out my mammo films got sent and they will be looked at by a radiologist in the Breast Center. I was thinking that about the BRCA testing too- it's been in the back of my mind to look into it since my father died. Does anyone know if they can look at the lymph node in my armpit with US at the same time they investigate the lump under the dimple? And would a breast MRI be able to look at the lymph node as well??",

      "Content": "SS095 wrote: I am looking for input on my symptoms and concerns. I am 38 yo and had a screening mammogram a month ago in July (had a baseline one 4 years ago). It showed some kind of \"asymmetry\" in the left breast below the nipple. I had a diagnostic mammogram a week later and was told it was fine, but never got to talk to the radiologist. During this time I re-discovered an enlarged lymph node in my left armpit- I remember finding it a year ago, but forgot about it. It doesn't seem to have changed much. I was debating getting that checked out, and then over the weekend was looking at my breasts in front of the mirror and for the first time checked them with my arms overhead. Discovered a dimple/indent under the left areola, inner quadrant which is only there when my arms are up (nothing under the right breast). I never really did this part of the self exam b/f so don't know how long the dimple has been there. When I put my finger in the dimple, I can feel a semi-hard pea size lump that I can move around a bit. It's right over a rib so kind of hard to tell the consistency of it. That breast seems a bit lumpier in other areas than the right- I'm pre-mentstrual right now, hoping it goes down when my period is over. Another thing I remember which maybe is just coincidence- with breastfeeding my 4th child (fully weaned a year ago), I consistently produced alot less milk on the left. I have family history on my fathers side- grandmother died of ovarian cancer, great-aunt had breast cancer, aunt had breast cancer, my father died of pancreatic cancer (which I've read is sometimes associated with BRCA gene). Nobody had the genetic testing. None of them were that young at diagnosis. I went to see my gyn a couple days ago. He spent some time with me but was kind of dismissive and not concerned. Could see the dimple but felt it wasn't from tissue pulling on anything- said it was probably from normal sagging and having breastfed and been pregnant x4 (even though it's only on one side!?). He couldn't really feel the little lump I can feel, just said tissue felt normal lumpy/bumpy. Said he didn't think there was anything palpable to biopsy. He has always been not concerned about my family history b/c of it being my fathers side, he seems to focus on the mothers. And of course the normal diagnostic mammo. He could feel the lymph node but thought it wasn't that big. (seems big to me- about 2 cm) He offered a referral to a general surgeon but only b/c he could see how worried I am. I left feeling like I was over-reacting and second guessing what I am feeling, but don't want to take any chances. I am a physical therapist (stay at home mom now), so feel my palpation skills are pretty decent- I really do feel a little lump different than the other bumpy areas. Instead of going to a local general surgeon, I set up an appt at a breast care center at a major medical facility, but can't see anyone till early next week.  They are starting me out with a nurse practictioner who will examine me and probably do an US- they are going to re-look at the mammos too. Anyone have any advice? I am feeling sick with worry, but wonder if I am overreacting. Am I right to be concerned and pursuing this?? Any tests I should be asking for- an MRI??

My films had been read again, and the radiologist saw nothing abnormal on the diagnostic mammogram. I've  noticed since my cycle ended that the area I'm concerned about has softened a bit. Now it kind of feels like a circular area of firm breast tissue, not all that hard but still under the dimple and I can move it around (nothing similar on the other side). The NP did a thorough breast exam and like my gyno didn't think the tissue felt abnormal. She also thought the dimple was just from loose skin and my breast changing size from all the nursing/pregnancies over the years. I am small chested and thin, and not alot of breast tissue. (although I don't understand why the other breast has none of the dimpling despite looking the same otherwise). She said the dimple doesn't seem to be pulling on anything below and isn't the kind of dimple they are concerned about. I had an ultrasound of that area and the enlarged lymph node in my armpit and the radiologist said it all looked normal and they could see nothing abnormal in the breast. When I asked how big the lymph node was he wouldn't answer and said size didn't matter, but it had normal characteristics. They didn't seem to think an MRI or further testing was necessary. I am getting a referral to the genetics counselor to see about BRCA testing. I'm feeling alot better but still a part of me that doesn't believe the dimple is really normal. I wish I knew how long it has been there. When I pull the skin tight below it with my arm up, there is less skin mobility than my other breast and the outline around the area looks funny to me with the skin pulled tight. I have an appt Friday with the local surgeon (not at the breast center, the one my gyno referred me too)- I was going to cancel it since I got in at the other place, but am debating keeping it for yet one more opinion. But I feel kind of like a crazy patient who just can't things go despite a  normal mammogram, ultrasound and a doctor, nurse practioner and radiologist saying all is fine. Any opinons?",
