But when the treatment plan was put in front of me I really felt like this was something solid and something I could put my mind, heart and soul into. And that calmed me down. My path was neo-adjuvant therapy and then surgery. I'll have radiation after surgery. But like I said, the hardest part for me was that two month period where I was seeing doctor after doctor and finally getting the diagnosis that I had kind of expected after finding the lump myself. But even though I had this sneaking suspicion about my diagnosis, it didn't make it any easier to bear emotionally. I have three little boys ages 7, 4 and (at the time of diagnosis) a 15 month old. I had too much going on not to tell anyone. I went on sick leave at work and a friend of mine put together a website through Lotsa Helping hands that included a calendar so that I could put my chemo schedule along with my kids' activities and people could sign up and take my kids to their activities. It was such a big help. One of the most important things I did? I put in a daily walk in the calendar. My friends could sign up and go for a walk with me. I'm the kind of person who won't go outside if left up to me so having to get out and meet someone for a walk was a real motivator. And I found it so, so helpful to get outside every day. I did it all throughout the fall. Winter was a bit more difficult. But definitely something I would recommend! I didn't have to move but my mom did come and move in with us. She has been here since September and my little one is VERY attached to her now. I don't know how the household will work when she leaves. Good luck with surgery. You can do this and we're all here to help you through it. ",

My middle child is what his daycare calls \"high energy\". He came in for a big hug and before anyone else could stop him he slammed into my chest. I went upstairs to bed and hubby gave me a percocet. I was crying in pain. Slept through the night till 6:30am. Moved a little and discovered it was really painful again. Maybe should have set the alarm to re-medicate after 4 hours. Oh well. I took a percocet upon waking and am feeling okay now. Boys...*sigh*",

So I took one at 6am and then at 10:30 I took an advil. Will try another percocet at noon but really not feeling any pain. Oh! I wanted to mention also that my surgeon had talked to me before surgery and said that he would try a sentinal node biopsy. If cancer was to be found, he would do the axilla node dissection. I was injected with a radioactive dye that went to the lymph nodes the day before surgery. In surgery, he found that the dye only went to one lymph node - the one that had tested positive for cancer in my biopsy way back last August. He removed it and sent it to pathology where it came back NEGATIVE for cancer and so he stopped!! Yay!! In the end, no axilla node dissection!!! That was a nice thing to wake up to.",

I will be doing radiation after surgery so I don't know if that will affect it either. I am getting intermittent hot flashes while on chemo and herceptin.

My chemo started with weekly Taxol and Herceptin treatments which aren't that bad and my hair stuck around (it thinned considerably but stuck around). It was my next round 12 weeks later that took all my hair. I shaved it at home and it was actually a relief. I had been really careful about taking showers for 12 weeks so as not to mess my hair too much because I didn't want to disturb the hair follicles. Blah. After I shaved my head I spent a glorious 10 minutes in the shower letting the water pour over my head. Will never forget that moment! I have two wigs (you can see from my avatar) one brunette that was expensive and very close to my natural color and one blonde that was free from my hospital. It's my fun wig.
