      "Content": "Jun 4, 2011 07:50PM - edited Jun 6, 2011 09:09AM by Loislee2 Hi, I am new on here. I had IDC. The initial diagnosis on April 9, 2011 was DCIS until the pathology after the lumpectomy showed it to be invasive. But the surgeon got it all and there was no cancer in the sentinal lymph node. I will be starting chemo on June 16.  I am wondering one thing and maybe some of you on here can answer. My 2 daughters with children were planning on coming to visit in July. They each have 4 children. Will I be able to handle having that many children around? My second session of Chemo will most likley be the second week of July. I would love to have my daughters around, yet don't know if it would be wise to have 4-8 active children around when I am going to have a weak immune system. I plan on calling my oncologist and asking him next week, but thought I would ask here since there is lots of experience with going through Chemo on here. ",
