That once it's given and the machine is turned off it's done. There is no residual effect and I could hold my new grand babies without worry. It is my understanding that you only have residual efffects if it is given internally. I don't know if this is what you are looking for but I thought I'd throw in my two cents. Good luck with your treatments!",

I also thought the parts that had never seen sunshine would be the worst, but actually it's the opposite. The part that's been exposed to the sun is already thinner because it's already damaged and thus experiences more redness and peeling. The redness and peeling aren't burns, btw; it's that the skin that we naturally slough off can't regenerate itself as normal skins does, so the skin layers become less dense.",

I use my lotions religiously as recommended but I have sensitive skin, so maybe that's why I've reddened so much. I hope this last week doesn't aggravate things too much more. As I said the skin is sore and itchy, but all in all, the treatments have not been that bad. The original post is pretty much what I have been told and what I have experienced.

I waited six weeks after my surgery because I was slow to heal from the surgery at my surgeons recommendation. I was cautioned not to start radiation before I healed completely because once I started it, the wound would not heal. My RO and MO had no problem with that. But that's a personal decision you will need to make. As for what you need for radiation, it can vary depending on the center where you are receiving your treatment and how your skin reacts. Some have more skin issues than others. I have very sensitive skin and expected it to be worse than it was. My center recommended Aquaphor for my lotion. I've also seen candula oil and some other heavier lotions like Eucerin recommended. Put it on after treatment and several times a day. You can't use it for 2-3 hours before your treatment because it can interfere with things, but be diligent about using it. Again, depending on your skin, you will have varying amounts of redness and may experience some itching and soreness. Pure aloe vera helps. I didn't get too red, but had a lot of itching, so I was given Silvadene cream by the center and later a Rx lidocaine. No deoderant with aluminum in it. I used Tom's, which can be found in health food stores (and a few regular stores), but you can also use corn starch. The corn starch can also be used under the breast it you have chafing. Bras really depend on your comfort level and breast size. No underwire for sure. I know some people found sports bras better, but they were uncomfortable for me. After the first couple of weeks, I went with out one whenever possible. I had a couple of camisole type shirts with a built in bra that weren't too tight, so I wore those a lot. Toward the end I just wore baggy t-shirts. Just be aware that the lotions are greasy, so I'd recommend just wearing a t-shirt or something you won't care about if it gets a stain; especially for sleeping.  I'm sure the other ladies will have recommendations for you. Good luck. I know it seems like a long time, but it really does go quite quickly. You may want to check the topic board. There are several groups that have ladies that are going through radiation at the same time that get together to compare notes and share what's working (or not working) for them. I found that to be very helpful for me. Hugs.",

I don't know how well I would do with a mask. 20 minutes is a long time to lie there. Are you able to listen to a book or music during treatments? That might make the time go faster if you can.

I never thought I'd miss exercising, but I did. You never think about certain things until you can't do them. Who thinks about having a dry mouth at night? Or being able to taste things. We just take it for granted. I still tell people you don't know how much work breathing is until you can't do it (I had lung surgery). You never think about it, except maybe if you have a cold. But when you have to conciously think about each breath in and out, you think about it and realize that the body is an amazing machine. Anyway, you're making progress and that's what's important. Hopefully, before long you will be giving out sage advice to people in your shoes.  HAPPY THURSDAY!",

No ribbon or anyting like like that, not a rminder of cancer, but a smal reminder of what I am capable of and what I can continue to do for those times when things get overwhelming. I was leaning toward a bible verse I like, but then I came across the Chinese symbol for crisis which literally means danger or peril meets opportunity. That symbol is going to be my reminder. I may be facing peril, but I have an opportunity to use what is not in my control to help others, to crusade for cure, to share knowledge, etc. In other words, I have an opportunity, and while I don't have control over my cancer, I do have control how I choose to live the remainder of my life. And let's face it, cancer may put the possibility of death right up in our faces, but I have been to the funerals of several friends and even the children of friends that were much younger than I am and they had nothing to do with cancer. None of us has any guarentee on how long we have here on earth, so I am going to take my \"crisis\" and do the best I can with what I have to work with, both good and bad. And when you think about it, isn't that what everyone should do all the time, young or old?",

They move me and adjust my position to match the computerized positioning coordinates. I'm only there a very short time. It takes me longer to get there than the treatments themselves. The first week I had no side effects at all. The second week the skin on my chest (below the collar bone to my cleavage) started to have something akin to a heat rash or shingles. They have cream for the itching. I have very sensitive skin so that may make a difference. I know some that have gone all the way through treatments with no rash or itching at all. I've also had a little fatigue and a dry cough, but nothing overwhelming, I drive myself to and from treatments. I agree with the poster above about the sun. I seem to be highly sensitive to the sun now even under normal circumstances. I get hot more quickly and it will definitely aggravate the itching if you have any. Be sure to use your lotion at least twice a day (1x after treatment and 1x in the evening) during your treatments and use sunscreen when outside.  Good Luck!",

The aloe and hospital ointments and creams are doing nothing to give me relief. I may have to call the doc Monday.

Something hormonal that was a positive. :-) I love it when people are talking about shaving their legs and I tell them I don't shave mine.

Be the Miracle, 50 Lessons for Making the Impossible Possible by Regina Brett is good. It's written by a cancer survivor who is (was?) a writer for a Cleveland paper). They are short stories/life lessons learned that can be listened to all at once or easily stopped and started because of the format. Many are from stories she came across as a reporter. She has another book written in the same vein out (whose name escapes me at the moment). Both were very inspirational to me and that was before my dx. I'm planning on reading them again. They are good reminders for anyone with or without cancer. Just a thought. HAPPY you get a two day breather FRIDAY!",

I guess that makes sense, since you don't rebuild new skin during radiation, so the parts that have never seen the sunshine are naturally thicker and therefore experience less aggravation. I had some itchiness and couldn't wear a bra much toward the end, but it wasn't near as bad as I had anticipated.

I had one that had straps that went a little farther out on my arm and the sides were more narrow than the others and were a soft fabric. Also it wasn't an underwire. My last treatment was this past Tuesday. My skin itches just a little on my chest and the underneath skin is starting to tan, but it doesn't hurt and I'm wearing a bra with no problem. I've actually been a little more tired than I was during treatment, which is odd, but I'm expecting to get back to normal soon.

I have a little residual itching now and again, but for the most part with exception for one small area, the redness is now tan and I have occasional itching. I have not, at least to date, experienced any peeling or rough skin which some people have experienced.  Really, the redness and soreness beneath my breast for the last week or so was the worst of it, and that was tolerable. I think the worst side effects happen to those that have had chemo, which I didn't, so that may be why. I'm sure you'll be fine, and all of this will be a distant memry soon!",

I wish I hadn't done the rads now; I think surgery alone may have been enough, but who knows? It was growing for 5-7 years, so whose to say there were not cells surrounding the lump? There are risks and repercussions for both arguements and both treaatment plans. As I've said on another thread, I made the best decision I could at the time and second guessing myself won't change anything. It is what it is and I can't change it. All I can do is live as healthfully and happily as I can. So now I work at adding life to my years and not letting worry take any amount of time from my life. :-) BTW when I had lung surgery years ago, they took so many xrays that I used to joke that if they took anymore I would golw in the dark. Now my MO wants me to have one each quarter. For what purpose? He does comprehensive blood work. If my numbers aren't off, why should I risk the add'l exposure? If my numbers are hinkey, than we can discuss it. He's gonna love me. First I refuse the drugs and now the xrays. Sorry, but the effects are cumulative and I'm not volunteering for anything if there is a non-radioactive alternative. I already have to have bone scans. I'm not goose stepping anymore for anyone!

That is right on the cusp of low to intermediary. I don't know why it's not 1-17 or 19-35, but 18 is the highlest an lowest number of each category. I was told that my recurrence chance with Tamox was 11% and double that w/o it, yet from all I have read it can come down to a little as 3% for an absolute risk. That to me is very low for all the side effects. I found several tests that show that more than the standard dose is too much, but none for why less isn't enough. I did read about a test that can tell if you process Tamox well or not. It's not 100%, but neither is the science the docs are using either to predict rcurrence. I would like to know if I might possibly be taking something with serious side effects that I'm not even metabolizing or getting any  benefit from. That may be why some ladies say they have few or no side effects. Maybe they aren't metabolizing it, ergo, they are not having the side effects.  I also disagree with my MO that not taking taking Tamox and doing nothing are two very different things. He just smiled and said all I can do is show you the data, the decision is yours to make. I found a naturopathic onclologist about an hour and a half away, but he doesn't qualify for my insurance and all my $ has gone for medical bills and not working for the last 6 months. sigh",

I learned more from the woman at the health food store than from my doctor. It's beginning to shift, but with big pharma making it so financially beneficial for tem to prescribe medicine for everything, most choose to write a script over advocating a healthier lifestyle. And why change when you can take a pill and still eat all the crap you want? It's as much on the patient as it is the doctor. I drive 35 miles to see mine. She's worth the drive. She helped me more in one visit than my previous doctor did in 2 years. If I hadn't gotten sick of being sick, I would still be walking around with h. pylori and would probably have a bleeding ulcer. Everything was labeled stress and I was given a script for stomach meds. I walked around sick for 2 years when a course of antibiotics would have cured me in 10 days!",

I started out with a cocoa butter cream that a friend swore by until I started to get red and sore, then I switched to the Aquaphor despite the goopiness of it because it seemed to more of a protectant. I think the important thing is that you use something and use it often. I used lotion during the day and after treatments and the Aquaphor before bed. I just used a couple of designated t-shirts to sleep in. This may sound a little off the wall, but if your dress is stapless, you may consider using an Ace Bandage to wrap around you. It would give you coverage but not be too uncomfortable. It might be worth experimenting with. :-)",

But when you look at the Tamox data the you find a small but real increase in uterine and endometrial cancer. Add to that if you get uterine or endometrial cancer while on Tamox it is likely that it will be in a much later and viralent stage and would require radiation, chemo, and/or surgery. Likely all three. Really? To keep one cancer at bay I have to risk getting two others; these are my choices??? CANCER SUCKS.",

I think it's pretty safe to say that no matter which drug we are taking, most of us have had to experiment with what is the best time of day to take it, with or without food etc. I tried taking mine at bed time because I have a sensitive stomach and I have read it best to take medication with gastric side effects at bed time. Big mistake. Caused insomnia big time. Now I set my phone alarm and take it in the late morning and insomnia isn't an issue any more.  Kjiberty - I was on my AI during radiation. I think it varies between docs what they prefer. The only thing that it really affected for me is that is a little harder for me to say if my fatigue is medication related or radiation driven. I'm inclined to believe it's the rads because it varies from day to day. I guess I'll find out soon. I'm done with radson Tuesday!",

      "Content": "Aug 23, 2012 02:00PM - edited Aug 23, 2012 10:26PM by Mini1 Although I experienced some post rad itchiness, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I bounced back from the rads. I do not have this shrunken, weathered, boob, I half-expected, to be left with. Besides the obvious scars from the surgery and less volume, of course, my skin is soft and basically the same as its pre-rads counter part. I have my energy back, the redness and tanning is gone, I have no more sore throats and finally, the itchiness is gone too. The only thing that remains is that I am still fairly sensitive to the sun, lthough not near as much as during the rads, although that could be because of my rads schedule; I simply was not able to be in the sun at all during the early and mid summer and our temps were 100+ many days this year. All in all, it was a quick recovery. I hope you all experience the same.",
