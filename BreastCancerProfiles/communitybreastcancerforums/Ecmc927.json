    "Content": "Ecmc927 wrote: I had a clear mammo/ultrasound two weeks ago. I asked specifically about IBC because of daily burning pain and discoloration. The radiologist said nothing from the scans indicated IBC or BC. My PCP gave a second opinion and said that he saw broken blood vessels on the right breast, in about a 2 inch area. (exactly where the pain is) I do see some small broken vessels on the left as well but not nearly as many. Additionally, it seems like they are getting a little bit more noticeable and I am now getting random pains under my arms. He said to give it three weeks and document any changes but this is really driving me crazy. I feel like I should just be referred to a breast surgeon. Sorry to  be a pain but I can't seem to stop the obsessive train of thought that this is something pretty important and I am not being treated correctly.  Log in to post a reply",
