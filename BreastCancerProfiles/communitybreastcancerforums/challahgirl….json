Originally I found a small, pea sized lump kind of under my nipple, had my first mam and ultrasound and they said it was ok. Had it checked again 6 months later and it had turned into a complex cyst which they immediately aspirated/biopsied. All was fine. Since then I had noticed a bunch of changes including a ridge type lump in the upper part of my breast. Was sent to breast surgeon to be evaluated and she said it was just fibrocystic changes and I am too young for any problems. Fast forward to 8 months later. I have cysts that come and go with my cycle, and after my cycle was done at the beginning of this month I noticed that one stayed around, situated around the 7 o'clock area on my left breast. I felt crazy itching in that area during a for a few days after my cycle ended, then it started hurting. Went to my primary on Friday and they said that the \"lump\" felt like it went from around 6 o'clock to about 9 o'clock and was more long than is round. They also noticed that it is noticeable without palpating it as it is stretching my skin a weird way. This morning I went and had another diagnostic mam and an ultrasound. Mam showed nothing except for extremely dense breasts and the u/s picked up no growth whatsoever though the radiologist did comment that I had interesting looking breast tissue. They could also feel the lumpy area when the wand went over it. So, i left with no answers, still a strange \"lump\" in my breast that is hurting and feels like its pulling on something from the inside. I suppose I am just going to watch and wait but it still makes me nervous, especially when no one seems to have any answers besides Im lumpy. Any advice? Is it pssible to have fibrocystic changes in just one breast? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
