      "Content": "VLH wrote: I've noticed that most women still working have chemo on Thursday so they have the weekend to recover. I have only been working part-time the past 20 years because I am disabled by fibromyalgia. My jobs don't allow last-minute cancellations because I am an instructor with no ready substitutes and some of my students drive 30-60 minutes to class. Therefore, I reluctantly stopped working until I get through my cancer treatment. I expected my lumpectomy to be a fairly easy \"one and done\" procedure, but ended up needing a second surgery to clear the DCIS found in the tumor margins, developed two large seromas and the procedure to drain one of them introduced an infection that I've been fighting for six weeks, most recently with daily IV antibiotic infusions. I'm hoping that my side effects won't prove too daunting; however, based on my surgical experience, I'm wondering if I should schedule chemo on Mondays if available so the staff will be on-site if I encounter problems. Or perhaps Tuesdays to avoid conflicts with Monday holidays? I think many people find the third day the worst, right? What day of the week did you choose and why? Do you wish you'd chosen a different day? Thanks!

My surgeon's office had a co-pay assistance program, but only for those with a very low income. (This is often a challenge when one falls in the lower middle income \"bucket.\" The costs are brutal, but you make too much to qualify for most assistance programs.) I did qualify for help with my chemo costs, which I greatly appreciated. My oncologist's office applied for that program on my behalf. The nurse navigator at my breast imaging center left work for health reasons shortly after I was diagnosed so was of limited assistance, but others have mentioned their navigator having information on financial assistance. It's terribly unfair that one should have to deal with the financial burden of medical expenses and lost income on top of the challenges of cancer treatment. Don't be shy about seeking help. Lyn",

The LE specialist mentioned it, but I balked when she said I would need to wear the initial bandaging for two weeks, wrapping the entire hand and arm for showering. I had to have a PICC line when draining a seroma resulted in a nasty infection, but that bandaging wasn't as intrusive when it came to households tasks, including caring for 2 - 50 pound dogs. I_Spy, interesting correlation with the adhesive allergies, isn't it, albeit with a tiny sample size? Luckily, I have no issues with topical antibiotics. I'm at fault to some extent with the initial skin cancer excision because I'd forgotten about my skin becoming very irritated when I had 37 staples following hip replacement surgery. Actually, surgeries because an incorrect component was inserted initially. The drop in blood pressure from two major surgeries in two days put me into kidney failure, I needed a blood transfusion & my three-day hospitalization morphed into a full week. I was fine after the initial surgery, had five friends in my room to celebrate that night only to feel like I'd been hit by a truck after the second one so maybe I blocked out the skin reaction as minor? 🤔 May our skin be free of #&$*@ cancer cooties from this point forward!

Seq24, possible side effects were shared at my chemo class, but both the nurse and the written material emphasized that not everyone will experience every SE.

Incidentally, the most common side effect of Perjeta, a targeted drug for HER2 positive women, is diarrhea, yet some women have constipation. ElizabethAM, you'll obviously want to double check with your doctor to rule out something more serious, but my chemo class nurse mentioned heartburn / acid reflux as a common side effect and recommended having Pepcid, Zantac (and maybe Mylanta?) on hand. I'm lucky to have a Costco not far away because their generics cost a fraction of the brand names. I think chills was one of the conditions I was supposed to report.

I'm trying to envision reading on a Kindle (my \"go to\" since I can crank up the font size). That means a lot of page turning. 2) I think I recall reading about pickle juice in a People's Pharmacy column years ago. It needs to be dill, right? 3) Do you think it will be difficult to remove the Neulasta pod if you live alone? (I have two 45 pound dogs, but don't think they would be good candidates for this job.) JanetCO , unless I missed it, I think you and I may be the only triple negative ladies here. (I think I'm triple negative; my core needle biopsy showed ER- PR- HER2+.) MFalabella , OUCH! I'm so sorry to hear about the infection. It must be challenging to get mentally prepared to see the MO only to face a delay. We'll be at the MO the same day. I see the B.C. in the morning (and wonder if she'll have to drain this blasted seroma for a third time) and the MO in the afternoon. A fun day of cancering!",

No growth seen and my mammogram and biomarkers didn't show anything worrisome so I think I'll be in the same situation except for mammograms. Would you believe I'm STILL not done with treatment? I decided to have my breasts reduced before radiation and the insurance process, difficulty booking an OR, etc., delayed the surgery significantly. I have my radiation mapping on 8/28. Unfortunately, I'm having neuropathy issues, including balance problems. The oncologist offered physical and occupational therapy, but I just can't face that while dealing with daily radiation.

I think we'll all have these weird bobbles periodically as our bodies try to rebuild from the chemical assault. Regarding your Costco interaction, when I was fully bald, a cheerful young teller was trying to make conversation, but kept putting his foot in his mouth. For example, he said, \"You're lucky that you don't have to go to work.\" After a meaningful pause, I said, \"Actually, I would love to be going to work instead of dealing with cancer and chemo.\" The good natured kid was clueless because cancer obviously wasn't in his realm of experience. I hope he's lucky enough to remain naïve for a very long time. Kechla, another surgery? BOO! I was able to quell constant, heavy bleeding with a D&C many years ago, but know that's not successful for many women. I hope all goes smoothly and that you recover quickly. Keep us posted! Great photo, Caligirl! I ran across an article that mentioned many women gain as much as 5% of their body weight after breast cancer treatment so be gentle with yourself if you're holding the line at 10 pounds of fluff. I've been having extreme carb cravings. The article mentions that hormone receptor negative women tend to gain the most weight. Ugh! I'm sorry that you're still feeling fatigued. :-( As for me, I felt lower than a snake's belly last week. I was grateful that my biomarker tests were normal & my plastic surgeon approved moving forward with radiation therapy post-reduction. Unfortunately, neuropathy in my dominant hand in both feet hadn't improved since my final chemo in March. Trying to regain my endurance and deal with chronic back pain, I'd been doing my balance and core strengthening exercises I learned at PT. I thought the unsteadiness in my gait and odd posture were due to pain medications, but took none for a few days and was forced to acknowledge that it was the neuropathy. I have radiation remapping next week and thought I could finally complete treatment only to realize that PT and OT might be required. More medical appointments and the financial impact of further delaying my return to work left me feeling desolate. Luckily, I have seen some improvement in my balance in the past few days with continuing my self designed exercise plan. Howdy, Dara! I can't get back to your note without losing this post, but didn't want to miss acknowledging you. :-) Hang in there, ladies! Lyn",

In my situation, insurance paid for the surgery as an option to reduce back, shoulder and neck pain rather than being coded as breast reconstruction. It was painful hoisting my F / G breasts up from my waist daily. Since radiation damages the skin, I felt compelled to get the reduction done before those treatments plus much smaller, less pendulous breasts meant much less tissue to be zapped. As Misslil said, if corrections are considered further modifications related to cancer reconstruction, I would expect insurance to pay. I need to be regaining endurance to get back to teaching dog obedience classes, which requires lifting heavy stuff, so doubt that I'll pursue more surgery. The results are somewhat disappointing, but choosing the lesser of the evils, I prefer my nipples too jauntily pointing to the sky rather toward my feet. Lyn",

I only had 3 nodes removed, but they were deep and I think that increased the discomfort. My cautionary advice would be to avoid having any seromas drained. The resulting infection delayed my chemo by weeks and the seroma refilled with 48 hours so it was basically all pain, no gain. You'll probably want some comfy sports bras and may even want to wear them to bed for a bit to prevent any stretching or jostling of your incisions. I prefer the bras without hooks, but found it better to step into them rather than reach overhead. You'll do great! Ajbclan, I'd suggest asking to see your PS's photo gallery, preferably women with a similar physique. I'd chosen a PS planning to have implants & BMX. His iPad was dead and when I saw his PA later to view photos, the results I saw were very disappointing. At my age and weight, I wasn't expecting to have the playboy bunny figure of my youth, but the photos I saw were not attractive to me. Without scrolling back for pages, when did y'all lose your hair after your first chemo treatment? Did you start with a buzz cut? Would you happen to know the blade length? I think that's the right term. My friend was a dog groomer & I may have her super sanitize her clippers so that I don't have to have the dirty deed done (dirt cheap, if you're a rock music fan) in public. Thanks! Lyn",

I don't know how you do it, especially with a toddler. I know you didn't volunteer for this. I'm truly in awe of your strength, but also want you to know you don't have to be a \"brave warrior\" here. Vent away if you feel the need because, da*n it, your situation just plain stinks! I wish I could offer you more than caring thoughts. Please keep us posted. {{HUGS}} I had my ultrasound and mammogram today. Despite my brief feeling of fear recently, both were fine. I went to a different facility this time, one recommended by my oncologist, and I was very impressed. I'm really hurting tonight because the mammographer had me all but standing on my head to be sure she got every square inch of interest. In addition to her thoroughness, the radiologist came in to check me personally and meticulously record the necrosis over my right reduction scar. My dopey nipples required extra images because of their weird location. I realized I'll need a new high neck suit if I take water aerobics classes. A relatively minor annoyance when I'm feeling incredibly relieved.",

The pain and tenderness in my breast and lymph nodes plus extreme fatigue had me a bit freaked out despite my recent clear mammogram. The shingles diagnosis surprised me because my rash didn't look like what I expected. Having said that, it's difficult for me to see the rash on my back so I resorted to contorting in front of a mirror taking a photo over my shoulder with my smartphone.

I had an echo after AC #3 when I when I went to the ER. That report was compared to my pre-chemo echo from September and there wasn't anything alarming disclosed. They focus on the left ejection fraction (hope I recall that correctly). I'm triple negative so not taking Herceptin. My chemo nurse mentioned labored breathing / shortness of breath and elevated heart rate are typical symptoms of dehydration. When I got fluids, it did make me feel significantly better by the time I left the infusion center, but we can't realistically do that every few days. I drink so much water that I have occasionally had low sodium and been told to back off, but it's like my body is dehydrating despite the intake. On AC, my blood pressure fell to a point that I had to stop my usual medicine altogether some days. (No complaints about that!) It's come back up with Taxol so I don't think that was a factor yesterday. Luckily, I don't have a cough, but my triple negative friend who is a few weeks ahead of me in treatment has had that as well as the shortness of breath and racing heart. It's weird that so many of us have these symptoms, yet I don't recall them being mentioned during my chemo class. Instead, the information was about fever, mouth sores, nausea, big D, constipation, etc. It's discouraging to hear that regaining our endurance can be a slow process. I'll still have radiation after chemo and I know that can sap our strength as well and I've had severe Fibromyalgia since 1989 so fatigue was already an issue. As an added bonus, lying bent awkwardly sideways in the van to avoid passing out antagonized my blasted back pain, too. Grrrrr!

Regarding Neulasta ads, I think the company heard some of the criticism because the ad that came out later in my treatment made the patient look less well than the original perky woman. To me, the bigger issue is how many suitable candidates wouldn't get the pod if the ads didn't air? If a minimal number, maybe spend those millions on research instead of marketing? My oncologist told me about Neulasta and it was mentioned at chemo class without any prodding from me. What about y'all? It's not like the ad that encourages the young woman to be more forthright with her gynecologist about endometriosis (or something similarly not relevant to an old fart like moi) or making a fellow more comfortable asking for help with ED. Those are topics patients might otherwise not mention due to embarrassment, but Neulasta? The big bucks were perhaps wasted on me anyway since I became neutropenic after 3 of my 4 AC infusions. Maybe I would have otherwise ended up in the hospital? Annie, you remain in my thoughts. Kechla, you've had far too much sadness.

Still, I'm not one to greet my house or thank my stained T-shirt before discarding it. I do think her book is helpful in making one more willing to part with items that don't really enhance one's life / \"spark joy.\" The folding techniques she demonstrates don't work as well on my ginormous granny panties as the tiny undies, tank tops and bras she typically demonstrates if you search for her on YouTube. 😄 I'm eager to kick a lot of stuff to the curb, but struggle to find the energy to get 'er done.

I may post this under a separate topic & will do a search as well, but I'm very scattered so have a question to pose before it falls out of my brain. What restrictions / complications did you face with your port placement surgery, either imposed by the doctor or because of pain, and for how long? For example, no lifting over 15 pounds for a week, I couldn't sleep on that side for 10 days because it hurt, I got a nasty infection, etc. Here's why I ask: Via my oncology nurse, if the infectious disease specialist thinks my seroma-related cellulitis is clear, the MO wants me to move forward with my first AC chemo infusion using the Picc line inserted for IV antibiotics. I've not been able to use one arm or the other for two months. Since my initial lumpectomy was on 7/14/16, I share her sense of urgency, but hate the idea of dealing with the Picc line an extra two weeks or more to wait for the nadir of the first treatment to pass. Take two surgeries / seromas / 6 weeks of infection plus six months of excruciating pain from herniated disc / sacroiliac issues. Add in severe Fibromyalgia, a ceiling leak requiring emptying a kitchen cupboard & my big china cabinet; an undetected garbage disposal leak that required emptying & rebuilding that cabinet; & the hall closet being flooded due to the a/c guys forgetting to recap the U joint. (Yes, I have a love-hate relationship with water!) People say that their houses look like an episode of \"Hoarders,\" but I'm serious. The Picc line means I can't lift more than 10 pounds to get the books, kitchen stuff & knickknacks to the donation center or try on, sort & launder clothes to keep, donate or trash. I have clothes from when I weighed 100 pounds more than I do now so I currently have a little path through the bedroom winding around the boxes, bags & bins of clothes and stuff. One study shows that delaying the start of chemo more than 90 days for triple negative patients increases the chance of death by more than 50% so I'm very aware of the ticking clock. (The MO said the clock starts at the last surgery, not the first, but I didn't think that was clear in the study.) I can't compensate for months of being debilitated, but would feel much better emotionally if I could have even a SINGLE week of determined purging with full use of BOTH ARMS before the chemo & radiation begins! If I should have a bad reaction to the chemo, I would be horrified at having friends come into my house in its current condition. Thank you! Lyn",

I would be tempted to ask the doctor to handwrite the blasted thing so you can hand deliver it asking the employee receiving it to sign and date acceptance while you record the event on your cell phone. It took multiple calls, but I was able to get in with my surgeon's office stressing a sense of urgency. Regarding the lymphatic stuff, I wonder if seeing a certified Lymphedema therapist for manual drainage might be an option? Done correctly, it's a very gentle technique, kind of feathery vs. significant pressure.

I know others take comfort in looking normal, but I don't have the energy yet to try to recreate my brows or line my puffy eyes to mimic lashes.

I had a period of time after my cancer diagnosis, but before any treatment, when the ugly cooties on my cancer side toenail disappeared and pink, healthy nail grew. During chemo the problem re-emerged. Now I have perhaps 1/4 inch of unaffected nail. The dermatologist diagnosed it as psoriasis, but I don't know if that's really accurate. I just know it's a nuisance because it doesn't respond to treatment and I find it difficult to do pedicures because of fine motor skill issues from fibromyalgia and now neuropathy in my dominant hand. Dara, I'm so sorry for your family's loss. I'm glad that your grandson is settling in to school. Keep up the good work on the pottery! I had my seventh of 16 radiation treatments today. So far, it's pink between the nipple and breast crease plus some on my chest, but nothing alarming. My blasted encapsulated shoulder is painful or the treatment wouldn't be bad at all. Because of the location and having to allow for traffic/construction, I do end up losing 2 to 2 1/2 hours per day. I wish the end of radiation would mark the end of treatment, but I'll probably end up getting a lymphedema pump so that will require an hour a day. Perhaps it will be a good chance to catch up on reading or find something fun on Netflix. Ajbclan, sending best wishes your way for an uneventful surgery and smooth recovery. Lyn",

YAY! I was looking quite pathetic with a lymphedema sleeve on one arm and 5 inch bandage on the other.

That's how I felt when doctors thought my hip implant was failing and every step took weeks or months as I went from teaching dog obedience 4-6 hours a week to using a rolling waller. There's a tumor marker blood test (CA 27/29 or something like that) that can be suggestive of metastasis. If the marker is only elevated once, I think they usually retest again in three months to see if it's a trend. Absent that or other funky lab work, I believe doctors rely on symptoms. For example, breathing issues might cause your oncologist to order a CAT scan, x-rays and/or PET scan. I've had shortness of breath issues lately, but a constantly stuffy nose suggests allergies related to record rain for weeks are to blame. Let's face it, any symptoms seem scary after breast cancer. Keep us posted on the GYN visits. Dara, I'm glad the infusions seem to have kicked some E coli butt (no pun intended!); however, the bone loss & looming surgeries stink!!! One of the few good things about triple negative is that we don't have to deal with the hormone-related treatment for years. Back pain is the pits. Simple tasks like grocery shopping, loading / unloading the dishwasher, vacuuming, mopping floors, etc., become literally painful. I've been in the mood to purge and clean lately, but it is discouraging to slug down pain pills that damage the kidneys & liver only to make minimal progress before being forced to quit. 💩 I hope the bone infusion proves fully successful.

I started my AC in mid-October and, thanks to a couple of delays, just had my 3rd Taxol yesterday. After my 3rd AC, I ended up in the ER with labored breathing, feeling faint and an elevated heart rate (100 - 120) with minor exertion. I had an echo, chest X-ray & CT scan that didn't show anything alarming. Today, I took advantage of my steroid buzz to run a few errands. The first two were easy so no problems. Then, I made a leisurely circuit at Costco and, while loading up my van, I got extremely lightheaded, nauseous and my heart was racing to a point that I had to lie down across the front seat to avoid fainting. Have any of you had this difficulty in terms of endurance? I wasn't in great shape when the cancer process begin because what I thought was a hip implant failure ultimately turned out to be a herniated disc / sacroiliac joint issue that made it extremely painful to walk or even stand for six months. Prior to that, I taught competition dog obedience classes 3-4 hours per week and trained / trialed my own dogs so I was fairly active. Right now, it feels like I'll never be able to return to work. :-( Lyn",

I had port surgery Monday and was surprised when I awakened to discover the surgeon put my port on the left side where I had two lumpectomies, a sentinel node biopsy with three nodes removed and an infection that endured for 8 weeks. There was a small incision and minor bruising or the right side where I expected the port to be. I called the port surgeon's office yesterday and again today trying to find out why. Today, he happened to be standing there so the employee asked about switching sides. He said he couldn't access the vein on my right side and it was nothing to worry about. I asked the employee if that was common and she said, \"It happens.\" I don't recall reading about anyone else getting a port switched to the surgical side. This surgeon was a referral from my MO , who said she's never had a problem with one of his ports in more than 10 years. Has this happened to any of you? It seems like there's been a bobble every step of the way with my treatment and I haven't even started the scary stuff yet. YIKES! Lyn",

It's been hard to make myself wear my sleeve and gauntlet In the heat of summer. I find myself going for the lowest compression, most stretched out sleeve because it's the easiest to don. Do you wear a sleeve daily? Re: the rash, I need to find a new dermatologist, but I know y'all can relate to not wanting any more medical appointments! 😲 Cali, great news on the colonoscopy & endoscopy results! I'm taking my friend for hers soon, but still haven't had one yet at age 64. I've imposed on my friends for rides so often with the cancer & back / hip issues & the prep sounds yucky. Excuses, excuses, right? I'm glad the msh2 gene is apparently not a concern, but, yeah, thanks for mentioning it two years later. 😦 The fires looked so scary! Have you gotten rain in recent weeks to reduce the danger? We got rain yesterday and welcome cool temperatures for a single day although now it's super humid and 90 degrees today. My mom in the Midwest had to put on a sweatshirt. Doesn't that sound wonderful? Dara, one does have to wonder if there is a sneaky genetic flaw lurking with 7 people having cancer in two generations & that's terribly scary! 😕 There's a lot of various cancers on my maternal grandfather's side of the family, but only a single known incidence of breast cancer in 4 generations. I know we tend to exaggerate the importance of familial history, but that field is constantly evolving. I'm a little confused. (Like that takes much!) Are you saying that the repeated UTIs were actually an E coli issue? Everything OK now? Are you back in the pottery studio yet? Isn't a sweaty head the pits? Hmmm, maybe not the best choice of words. 😁 Even when I was 18, slender and got tons of exercise, my face and head would sweat profusely while the other girls in my dance class would get a pretty, dewy flush on their faces. With my hideous post-chemo hair, I wear a baseball cap whenever possible and choose dark colors to hide the nasty sweat line. 😞 Maybe it gets better as your body adapts to the hormonal changes? Annie, you're thought of often.  Check in when you get a chance, All! Lyn   ",

Congratulations on the great grandbaby-to-be. Cali, the matching tatts are great, definitely an upgrade from the pesky radiation tattoos. I'm dealing with foot pain, too. Not long after my reduction surgery in mid July, I started feeling like the bones in my feet were collapsing. I was determined to get through my long delayed radiation so haven't seen a podiatrist yet. I already had arthritis in my feet and have a buildup of bone spurs on top of both feet about an inch high. Kelly / Kechla, I'm glad that your recovery seems to be going well. How sad about the cancer in your family. My mother has been hospitalized a couple of times from c. Diff that developed after she got antibiotics for dental surgery. It's a nasty ailment and she doesn't seem receptive to the disgusting, but quite effective, fecal transplant option. I hope that all went well with your dog's surgery and that your birthday dinner was fabulous. I'm meeting a friend for Tex Mex tomorrow. She was amazing about providing transportation during my cancer treatments. Dara, I'm sorry for your family's loss. I hope you'll soon share news about perfect test results. Tobyholic, I've taken Lyrica for years for Fibromyalgia. It's a bit like Gabapentin and, knock on wood, I haven't had any adverse side effects. I should note that I take it at night it if I'm not going to drive just to be cautious. Ajbclan, I'll have to check out the song you shared! As for me, my skin held up quite well through radiation and is recovering nicely. One annoying side effect that I haven't heard others mention is what I can best describe as prickly heat. When I get the least bit warm, it feels like tiny pin pricks of heat on my torso. I think radiation worsened my lymphedema a bit. I need to make an appointment to see about a pump, but have just been too tired to address that. The neuropathy in my feet, shins & dominant hand continue. I saw the plastic surgeon this week. Medically, I consider my reduction surgery a success in terms of shoulder & neck pain related to hiking my breasts up from my waist. Aesthetically, less so. The skin flap / dog ear on my left side shrunk markedly from radiation but the one on the right still looks like a small extra breast that tends to escape my bra. My nipples, which looked perfectly placed immediately following surgery, look about an inch too high as my breasts have settled. The surgeon says it's due to skin laxity (63 years old & 100 pound weight loss). She said she could attempt a repair, but the skin would likely sag again in six months. I don't know if she's right or wanting to avoid another surgery and who would pay for it since the insurance payment was for the reduction aspect? The lack of volume in my upper beast makes bra buying a challenge. I didn't get nauseous after this surgery & no infection so do I take a chance given that I'm not planning any nude modeling? Probably not... I've probably missed someone, but the pups say they're done digesting dinner and want out of their crates right now! Lyn   ",

I've been working both my part-time jobs the last couple of weeks plus had a weekend seminar so barely keeping my head above water. I was very apprehensive about going back to work, but, to my relief, it's gone quite well. I had about 30 minutes of chemo brain on Thursday, my \"double duty\" day, but my kind students were patient until my focus improved. Annie, you're in my thoughts. Please check in if you get a chance and feel like sharing. Kechla, how is your dad feeling? How are you doing, Cali? I was sorry to read about your son's friend. It's nice of you to offer support and empathy through the \"Pink Heals\" program you mentioned. I can't even imagine coping with triple negative cancer as a young mother. :-( Ajbclan, I was sorry to read about the passing of KZ1966. After dealing with all the challenges of treatments, it's so heartbreaking and unfair when they prove ineffective. Regarding plastic surgery, add me to the list wanting work done. Dara, a Brazilian butt lift produces a full, high rear using implants. I've always had plenty of junk in the trunk so not for me! The 100 pound weight loss has left my stomach hanging midway down my thighs, a very attractive look! I would love to have my arms a normal size, the bags under my eyes could hold a small child and my sagging jaw line exacerbates my resting b**ch face. After all the cancer related surgeries, you'd think appearances wouldn't matter, but, darn it, they do! My hair is taking a ridiculously long period of time to grow. March 10 marks a year since my last chemo treatment and I just had my first haircut last week. The top sticks straight up & is still too short to sweep over my bald spot. This girl needs her comb-over! My heart goes out to the ladies with permanent hair loss from Taxane drugs. Ajbclan, I'm sorry your reconstructive surgery doesn't make you feel whole. Could you elaborate on that? Is it that the implants feel foreign or the transition from chest wall to implant is unnatural or ??? It does no good, but I fret, wishing I'd handled my treatments differently. My original plan was a bilateral mastectomy with implants & no chemo. I backed out of the mastectomy because of concerns about tissue expander infections, a greater chance of lymphedema and the plastic surgeon saying I could probably only get a C cup, a size I last had in 9th grade at 110 pounds. I ended up having two lumpectomies & the nasty infection requiring IV antibiotics. Now, I can't fill must most C cup bras and the breasts have dropped a lot since reduction surgery. The lymphedema has left me my surgical arm nearly 25% larger than the other arm. The neuropathy presents a constant risk of falls and has so weakened my hand grip strength that I had to have a student open my Diet Dr. Pepper bottle yesterday. A \"grippy\" must always be at hand in the kitchen. My genomic study showed alterations associated with resistance to chemo and radiation and chemo only offered improved odds of survival of 6%, so I find myself wondering if I am experiencing these permanent side effects to no avail. I'm VERY grateful that I've had no evidence of disease thus far and it's still a relief to not have my breasts down at my waist, but I wish I'd made different choices in treatments and surgeons. Woulda, coulda, shoulda thoughts, away with you! Anyone else battling this? Whew! That was quite a vent. Thanks for listening, my faithful chemo buddies. 💖 Lyn",

Having to worry about the financial aspect of treatment seems like adding insult to injury. I hope the new drug does the trick. Two years...I know that you miss Kathie. Kelly / Kechla, I'm sorry that you're having a rough time of it. It stinks to be caught between a rock and a hard spot when it comes to joint pain vs. reducing the odds of recurrence. I hope the trip to Des Moines is a nice respite. Lyn ",

I plan to work on crowding out some of the unhealthy food with better choices rather than giving up the good stuff. I'm going to be working both part-time jobs the next couple of weeks.

With my two surgeries, two large seromas and the PICC line, my physical activity, especially lifting, has been limited since mid-July. With finally regaining the use of both arms late last week, I've been trying to tackle tasks from simple vacuuming to cleaning the back shelves of the fridge to grooming my dogs and fear my blasted sacroiliac joint is inflamed or herniated disc irritated again. That likely means another spinal injection. We've had countless delays already so the MO wants to go forward with my chemo on 10/11 and we're hoping I can get the spinal or SI injection 10/13. The pain management specialist's office closes early on Friday so I couldn't talk to them about the urgency & importance of the timing relative to chemo. I may hand deliver a summary of what's going on so my request for help doesn't get buried in Monday morning voice mail. How did you all feel on Day Three? (I'm counting the infusion as Day One and Neulasta delivery the next day as Day Two.) After going to the wrong office tower initially, calling for additional directions, having trouble finding a parking spot at the correct building, realizing there was no entrance on the side of the building with the street address and building number, calling again for further clarification and walking half the length of the hospital to the main entrance and back again mere yards from where I started, but inside now, I was frazzled by the time I saw the port placement surgeon. I was seen promptly and he was nice do that was fine. I got to the CVS back in my suburb to have my flu shot and got a call on my cell from the hospital saying they just got orders for an EKG and blood work for Monday's surgery. OMG, I just left there 30 minutes ago and no one mentioned that little tidbit? My echocardiogram from 9/15 and blood work from 9/14 isn't good enough. Rush hour(s) was already starting so I knew driving back to the hospital would be a pain in the butt (and remember my butt / hip already hurt!) so now I have to be there 2 1/2 hours early Monday and hope nothing is disclosed that will delay the port surgery. I hate to sound like Wendy Whiner and my problems pale compared to what some of you have endured so please forgive me for climbing on the Pity Pot for one minute to wail, \"Can NOTHING in this #!$@# blasted cancer process be easy?\" Lyn",

But, seriously, I feel bad that you and Nayda had this added stressor with the flip flopping ports. Ugh! Sorry that I fell off the planet. My Kindle Fire periodically removes topics from my Favorites & I finally thought, \"Gosh, I'm surprised that no one has posted an update on their chemo\" and realized what happened. I was glad to read those reports about things going well so far and offer support to those who are struggling. As for me, this has been a challenging week. I saw the surgeon Tuesday & she chastised me for not calling about my skin still being red from the seroma draining infection. I told her that I HAD called the week before noting that the seroma in my SNB incision was smaller, but my skin was still red and would topical antibiotics be appropriate? Via the nurse, she'd said the topical wasn't appropriate and this week's appointment was confirmed. I know she was concerned for me & she quickly went to work getting me into a specialist. We'd tried finding one 2 weeks earlier, then backed off when their office never returned my call and the oral antibiotic had provided significant improvement. Thursday, I'd allowed an hour to get to the hospital since it was 9:30 in the morning & the traffic report hadn't shown any accidents. It took me an hour & 20 minutes so I rushed in panicked. The receptionist told me the doctor might not see me because I was more than 15 minutes late so I was in the waiting room trying to fill out paperwork while sobbing. Fortunately, the specialist did see me & she was lovely, so compassionate. The staff was breaking for lunch so I hung out for an hour, then had an IV infusion. When I finally got home, I called my MO's nurse to update her & my genomic test had just come in. I was devastated that the triple negative diagnosis was confirmed instead of the HER2+ report we'd hoped we'd receive. Yesterday, I allowed nearly 2 hours to get back to the hospital for a Picc line & tutorial on administering antibiotics at home. I finished just in time to drive 45 minutes to the MO's office. I have my CT & echo next week and, if all goes smoothly, chemo will start in a couple of weeks. The MO said she could start chemo with the Picc line so we wouldn't have to wait for the port (non-flippers only, please!) After two surgeries in just under two weeks plus fighting the infection for over a month, I've been exhausted and done nothing to prepare. I awakened at least ten times last night since I can't sleep on my favored right side so will probably continue being tired and cranky plus now I'm not supposed to lift with my dominant hand. Things have been slogging along so slowly, but now it feels like everything is kicking into high gear. Three medical appointments this week, three next week and my house is a hot mess. Eeek! ",

Since that's not standard of care and the drug is wicked expensive, insurance coverage might be an issue. The surgeon discharged me today. In the past two months, I've had two lumpectomies, two large seromas, and a nasty, stubborn infection. My arm is a bit swollen and my breast is still about two cup sizes larger than her sister, but other than the upcoming port procedure, I'm glad to have the surgical portion of the treatment done. With everything that went wrong with what I thought would be the \"one-and-done\" easy part of treatment, apprehension about chemo and radiation is growing. Lyn",

Since anesthesia often makes me nauseous, I was fine with that. Getting rid of the port is a tangible sign that you've persevered through chemo. Good luck! Lyn",

I know this group will be a huge help to you. I feel compelled to comment on the \"chemo is what you make it\" advice you've heard. I was very excited to have a total hip replacement in 2007 so I could get back to swimming 2-3 times per week and other activities. I'd done my research & felt confident about both my surgeon and the hospital. My surgery went smoothly (or so I thought), I was pleased with how nice my room was, pain relief was fine and, after ensuring we wouldn't disturb other patients, five dear friends joined me for a celebration in my room. The next morning, the surgeon advised me that an incorrect component had been used & I would require revision surgery. A day or two after that, the medical doctor had to tell me I was in kidney failure, which the kidney specialist attributed to my blood pressure going too low with two surgeries in two days. I ultimately needed a blood transfusion and my hospital stay was doubled. Was I just not positive enough? I wrestled with surgical choices for my breast surgery, ultimately deciding on a lumpectomy because I expected it to be an easy procedure with a quick recovery. I had to have a second surgery to get clean margins, developed two large seromas and got a stubborn infection when one was drained. In my experience, expectations don't drive side effects or complications or my hip replacement would have gone flawlessly. I share the lengthy personal history because I think the \"just think positive thoughts\" makes women feel that they've somehow \"failed\" if they have side effects or can't work full-time during their treatment. I'm thrilled when I hear of people making it through chemo without major issues and hope I'm one of them, but hate the idea of anyone feeling guilty if everything doesn't go smoothly. Please be gentle with yourself. You'll get a lot of great information here and from your medical team that will help reduce problems or minimize them if they occur, but know that there will be support and empathy if you hit a bump in the road. :-)",

My first port was implanted by surgeon under general anesthesia. The surgery was much easier than my lumpectomies, a shorter procedure with no nausea upon awakening from anesthesia. I was sore for a few weeks. Unfortunately, that port ended up looping and retracting from its original location and ultimately had to be replaced. The second port was inserted under Conscious Sedation by an Interventional radiologist. Once again I was very sore, but the surgery was even easier because it was at an outpatient facility with easy parking, quick check in and a very short time in recovery. Once I finally got a port that functioned properly, it's far superior to a PICC line or new IV with each treatment. I previously had a PICC line for IV antibiotics, and I hated fussing with it for showers, worrying about one of the dogs catching the line with a toe, not being able to sleep on my preferred right side, etc. Good luck!

As a \"vintage\" woman, I've had a bit of a dark mustache and some fine, blond hair along my jaw line for years. Post-chemo, the mustache is much more pronounced and I have fine blond hair intruding even on my forehead as far in as my eyebrow arch! What at-home product do you ladies use for facial hair removal? I've tried an electric razor, but dislike how rough my skin felt afterwards. I'm thinking waxing, but have been nervous about trying it. Salon services or electrolysis are out of reach financially. Does you hair have to be left to grow to maximum length before you can wax? Since I've always had fairly bold, dark brows, I was thrilled when they and my lashes returned. Interestingly, I'm going to have to pluck in the uni-brow and arch area that have required little attention in years and my brow hairs seem even darker and coarser. Also, I'd been able to pretty much stop shaving my arm pits and that hair is coming back with vigor. Have others found this true? Lyn aka WolfWoman",

My remapping is scheduled for 8/28. Why a remapping? I decided to have reduction before radiation knowing that the skin can be compromised. It's been 15...yup, 15, months since my diagnosis. Only the reduction delay is my fault so it's kinda been one thing after another. I jotted down a few quick notes, but suspect I'll have some usernames or details wrong so I ask forgiveness in advance. ;-) It's good to see a couple of other reduction ladies here. Mine was a challenging case. Still obese, I had lost 100 pounds prior to my lumpectomies so my poor bosom was sagging and dragging to the extreme. My F / G breasts are now a C / D. With such extensive intervention, I've got some ugly skin flaps / dog ears that are painful five weeks post-reduction. I'm very glad they won't be in the radiation path because their location is one even my stretchy Fruit of the Loom sports bras rub. Anyone else? Regarding \"headlights,\" I have found a couple of bras with very light padding / shaped cups that do a good job hiding them and I've had extremely prominent nipples since high school. I know that beaus in my younger days found them appealing, but they were a source of embarrassment when I was in the working world and I dislike them walking into the room five minutes before the rest of me. I don't have much sensation in the nipples now so I hope that means the darned things won't hurt during treatment! Loribee, congrats on the swimming record! I used to love swimming laps, but swim times at the city pool are very limited, a badly encapsulated shoulder made most strokes difficult and I stopped going when I got more involved in dog sports. Thanks for reminding me that I must ask the RO when it will be safe for me to swim in a public pool again. My RO prescribed the triamcinolone (sp?) cream, to, as well as a Japanese skin cream only available via Amazon. I was going to do prone position so hope that will still work with the smaller breasts. I wonder about boosts to the tumor bed since the plastic surgeon's operative report cites removing an area that appeared to be part of the lumpectomy site when she did the reduction plus I know she did some rearranging to maximize remaining breast tissue. Another RO question, but did anyone discuss that prior to rads? My RO initially recommended the 16 + 4 schedule, but readily agreed to 15 sessions when I brought up the Canadian protocol. After five surgeries, two infections and a tough time with chemo, even five extra battles through construction and heavy traffic seemed daunting. I'm in my early 60s, clean margins after the 2nd lumpectomy and node negative so don't think more rads would provide improved benefits despite my triple negative status. I found remarks regarding feeling emotional very interesting. I don't have family within a thousand miles and dislike imposing on friends so have mostly dealt with this on my own. I've only had a couple of meltdowns, including one when my second lumpectomy was delayed 1 1/2 hours without explanation. I've been on the verge of tears for days. I thought my unsteady gait was due to pain medications; however, was very distressed to learn that it's apparently the blasted chemo induced peripheral neuropathy in my feet to blame. I thought radiation would be the end of this extremely long treatment plan only to recognize that I may still face weeks of physical therapy (plus OT if I work on my hand). Knowing some women have ended up with congestive heart failure from chemo, I feel like a Wendy Whiner complaining, but I was so ready for these countless medical appointments to finish. Impaired balance would be a problem for both competing and teaching dog obedience so it affects work and play and I simply hate feeling like I could easily topple over. Fingers crossed, the neuropathy will still dissipate on its own. I'm doing balance / core strengthening exercises learned during physical therapy for a herniated disc and inflamed sacroiliac joint in the interim. I don't care to add broken limbs to this fun experience! So fun to see all the canine companions! I'm sorry this is so long, but I read through several pages of posts so had lots of thoughts.

Re: your RO, I'm astounded at how the profession denies side effects far more so than surgeons or MOs. When a woman makes it through chemo with minimal nausea issues, has no expectation that rads will cause nausea, yet ends up feeling queasy after every daily radiation treatment, perhaps acknowledge that nausea IS associated with RT for some patients. And fatigue isn't a SE? Seriously? A fate I wouldn't wish on anyone, if our doctors had to go through treatment with a lovely array of side effects, I think a whole new level of compassion would emerge in cancer care. Of course, the downside is the people in charge of saving our lives would have chemo brain so... My MO was amazing, trying to get ahead of / respond quickly to problems. Quite spoiled, I wonder if my RO will be dismissive of SEs. Since I don't see a separate reduction surgery topic, I'll ask here: Are you areolas quite pale compared to your nipples? The surgeon said she's pleased with the blood flow so that's not an issue. Monday is my radiation remapping. Tuesday, I take my beloved dog to the vet to see if a growth signals the beginning of the end.

My incisions have been healing well and I faithfully performed the arm lifts to the front the nurse showed me at the hospital and had good range of motion in that direction from the beginning. I was intermittently having a stinging sensation in my armpit quite a distance from the node incision so late Friday night I decided that I needed to see what was going on. I have genetically large upper arms and tons of sagging skin related to a 100 pound weight loss plus a badly encapsulated shoulder so an armpit selfie was used to help me \"see\" the skin in the awkward location. I found the skin ouchie and confirmed there was no evidence of infection so thought all was well. Unfortunately, within the hour, I developed significant swelling and discomfort over the node incision area and down to the breast that has been slow to respond to icing. The discovery of DCIS means I'm scheduled for a re-excision lumpectomy Wednesday so I reluctantly called the surgeon yesterday to advise her what was happening. She wasn't especially alarmed and said to keep icing and discontinue the arm lifts. Has this happened to anyone else? It's disconcerting to do well, then suddenly have a large, tender tennis ball at the front of my armpit over a week later. My main concern, however, is that the surgeon might want to insert a drain during surgery #2. I live alone so not being able to drive is a big problem. (As an aside, when I was considering a BMX, the PS said I could drive if not taking any pain meds provided I could easily maneuver the steering wheel in an emergency.) I checked all my surgery instructions and nothing said to avoid lifting my arm over my head, but I certainly regret doing so.

Equipment probably varies from facility to facility, but my facility had a pink foam surface with a cutout for the affected breast. If you do a Google search and look at images, you'll see some possible positioning options. If not for my badly encapsulated/frozen shoulder, the procedure would have been totally painless. Even with the shoulder pain, the procedure was quick enough after the initial mapping and rehearsal that it was definitely bearable. Good luck! Lyn",

This blasted cancer stuff is a scary business and especially challenging when tackled without a good support system. The drug protocol in your profile is the same one that I followed except for Perjeta. I'm a little confused by that because I thought Perjeta was for HER-2 positive tumors, not triple negative, but treatments evolve over time. A friend took me to my first infusion & the day I switched from Adriamycin / Cytoxan (AC) to Taxol. Other than that, the only help I had was rides to surgeries or procedures requiring sedation and one week of friends bringing meals. I've had severe fibromyalgia for 30 years and shortly before diagnosis had dealt with six months of agony from an misdiagnosed herniated disc. I ultimately had five surgeries, two infections that delayed chemo, five months of chemo and 16 radiation treatments. As others have noted, it can be very challenging, but doable. Despite having a Neulasta pod after each AC treatment, I was neutropenic (that word looks wrong, but I'm too tired to research it) following 3 of the 4 infusions so I can see why there might be some issues when it comes to working with animals. I had food delivered via Amazon Fresh (definitely splurge on that or another delivery service!) and avoided people other than medical visits, wearing a mask when I did have to go out. The main challenge I had was not nausea, but rather that my blood pressure ran low and my heart rate was constantly very rapid starting with the second infusion and continuing for a month following my final chemo infusion. I felt so weak that I had to use a rolling walker and take multiple breaks just getting to the infusion center; however, that seems to happen to a minority of people so it's quite unlikely that you'll experience that side effect. My house was a horrible mess going into treatment because of the pre-existing issues I mentioned so I was too embarrassed to pursue the house cleaning program. If I could go back, I would put my pride aside & accept the help. My nurse navigator was apparently dealing with her own issues and provided virtually no assistance, but many do plus the American Cancer Society was a good resource for me. Again, please reach out for help. As to the topic title about whether anyone has refused chemo, some people do with good results, but there is no right answer. I suggest pinning down your oncologist on what your \"net\" risk is; specifically, the risk of cardiac issues or other serious complications vs. the likely benefit offered by going through chemo. Of course, someone has to be that \"rare\" outlier, but you'll at least have some numbers to ponder. If you go forward with chemo, look for \"Starting Chemo in October\" or a similarly named topic. It's great to have the emotional support and be able to share concerns with others going through the same situation. I hope all goes well for you! Lyn",

Looking at photos of women in position for radiation, whether prone or supine, has me very concerned because my encapsulated shoulder simply does not allow my arm to go where it needs to go for this stuff. I thought this image was good at showing how prone position may help our large, \"pancakey\" breasts to get radiated while minimizing lung exposure if they're spread across our chests. ARRRGH!

If based on a core needle biopsy, you should be able to get the pathology report that will tell you what kind of cancer you have and whether it's hormone receptor and/or HER2 positive. You could go ahead & schedule an appointment with another breast surgeon right away. If you get into Surgeon 1 first, that can be your first opinion. If the other should happen to have an earlier opening, Surgeon 1 can be your second opinion. As noted above, you'll be working with a team of experts. You'll need a Medical Oncologist (MO), who will make recommendations about whether chemo or targeted therapy is appropriate. Although you can meet without the pathology information, the MO could only speak in generalities vs. making specific recommendations. It's possible that your team might recommend chemo or targeted therapy before surgery (called neoadjuvant therapy). That way, the tumor will hopefully shrink making for a smaller surgical incision plus you'll know how effective the particular drugs were in treating your cancer. If you choose to have a lumpectomy, which is the most conservative surgery, you'll typically have radiation, which is supervised by a Radiation Oncologist (RO). If you choose a single / unilateral or double / bilateral mastectomy and would like what's called reconstruction surgery to use either your own tissue or an implant to replace the breast, there will also be a plastic surgeon (PS). It's all a bit overwhelming in the beginning and challenging to learn the terminology and widely used abbreviations, but just take it one step at a time. This forum will be invaluable in helping you so feel free to reach out with questions. There is some excellent information available on the Internet, but you need to be very discerning when it comes to which sources are credible. If you haven't already, take a look at the main BreastCancer.org website. I've also found the American Cancer Society people incredibly sympathetic and informative so consider calling them. We all know how shocking and scary this is for you!",

My MO referred me to that surgeon because she'd never had a problem with his ports in the past ten years. Lucky me to be the exception! I had it removed and a new port put in at an interventional radiology facility yesterday. I was awake throughout both procedure, but there was only minimal discomfort. I am, of course, very sore today, but what I would expect in terms of pain and bruising. I'll find out Tuesday whether the new port works properly.

In my case, there's been a lengthy delay. I initially was going to have bilateral mastectomy, but chickened out late in the game after seeing the plastic surgeon's photo gallery plus I was very concerned about the pain that many experienced with tissue expanders. Consequently, I didn't discuss the option of a reduction in conjunction with the oncological procedure. Due to age & a 100 pound weight loss, my F / G cup breasts hang down to my waist. Since it's occurring many months after the lumpectomies, it's not considered reconstruction and insurance approval was a lengthy process, despite calling to confirm that the PS's report noted that radiation was being delayed. I developed a nasty infection when my SNB seroma was drained so infection is a worry. I live alone with two large dogs so self-care might prove challenging. I've been buxom since the 9th grade (a 32 D or DD at 112 pounds) so am concerned that my resulting breasts will be too small. In order for insurance to pay their share for the surgery, over 600 grams must be removed during the procedure. I have a large, droopy stomach and want significant protrusion so tunic tops will drape gracefully over my problem areas. Given that I still would like to lose another 50 to 60 pounds, my preference would be for an uplifted D cup, but the PS doubts she can do that and meet the insurance company's requirements. I may end up much smaller than desired, but that's the trade-off I must accept since I can't pay for the procedure myself. Since she's seen unpredictable changes in size related to radiation, this surgeon aims for symmetry. I hope I won't experience significant shrinkage or swelling that will leave me unbalanced. Lyn",
