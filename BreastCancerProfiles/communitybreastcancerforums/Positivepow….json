Did not have any problems with the skin during rads , but two weeks later now skin has turned blackish and  started peeling. I have a big circle of peeled skin under my arm which is red.  Is this common? What do most of you do for this ? how long does is take to heal, how do most of you deal with work ? going out ? I   have large breasts and am now wondering what to do. Was hoping that I would be able to deal with radiation without issues and I hope this is short term, Appreciate some input/ suggestions.",

I was just happy with the 3 weeks and am happy to get done with it. However, I was warned that they are not sure about the lymphedmia as the trial has not studied if the risk is increased or not and I am hoping not. ",
