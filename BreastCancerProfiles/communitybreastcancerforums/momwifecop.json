Long story short, they proved to be 1 fibroadenoma, and 2 intraductal papillomas, all benign. The 2 papillomas must be removed, and the fibroadenoma will be removed as well. My concern is that the papillomas have  5-8% chance of finding a malignancy after removing them, and my surgery isn't scheduled for another TWO months! I understand that docotr's are busy, but having to wait this long is horrible! You're not alone! Hang in there!",
