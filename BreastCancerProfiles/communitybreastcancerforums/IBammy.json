Confused, I went into the bathroom and started prodding around. I immediately noticed a very small bruise.. and just below it, within the tissue.. I noticed a long indent. Almost like someone had put a sharp corner against my breast really hard and caused the tissue to separate. To the left of the indent I noticed a small lump. Obviously the first thing that came to mind was breast cancer so I made a doctors appointment right away to get examined. The doctor told me that he could feel what I was explaining and by this time over top the internal indent and small lump, a massive yellow bruise formed. The doctor said it was probably trauma to my breast but I had absolutely no idea where or how I hurt myself, I don't remember hurting myself at all. So because of that he sent a referral for me to get a mammogram and ultrasound. My apt is on Oct 3rd. As a person who suffers from anxiet.. I can not rest or even function properly because I am absolutely terrified. Upon examine myself again today.. I can still feel everything internally but the bruise is subsiding. From what I can tell, there is no nipple discharge or any changes to the skin itself other than the bruise. Doesn't appear that there is any swelling really or anything massively different look wise. When googling my symptoms the first thing that appears is inflammatory breast cancer. So of course I just ended up scaring myself all over again. I had a child almost a year ago. And did try to breast feed. But couldnt. And that's where this next thing comes from. The last couple days I've been getting what almost feels like growing pains in my upper breast.ive been getting a sensation in my nipple that resembles what it feels like when milk let down happens. But again.. no discharge or anything. I'm confused and scared and just need some kind of answer. Please help if you can. Please. So. I am 28 years old.. if that makes any difference. Thanks.

I noticed it a couple weeks ago and seen my local doctor. I wasn't even looking for it when I found it. My arm just kind of brushed against my skin and it hurt. So I went to the bathroom to look. I seen a small bruise and felt around to find a weird shaped lump below the bruise. Then the following few days, a massive yellow bruise completely covered the area and then some. The doctor told me that since there was a bruise that it was likely that I hurt myself and that the lump was collected blood within fat nodules. But I had no recolition of hurting myself whatsoever. So I am being sent for both an ultrasound and mammogram. Which is on Friday. But I'm doing the same thing.. poking and prodding and googling. And everything I've found says anything benign generally is round or oval, smoothe. Not at all like what I have. Which is like yours, triangular shaped. I have created such terror in my mind that I can't eat, I can't sleep... I've lost 10 lbs in a week. I'm 29. I have two kids. A 6 year old and an 11 month old.. and I am so sick at the thought of it being cancer and not being there for them.",
