Had my first mammogram 3weeks ago and my 41st Birthday. 2 mammograms, an ultrasound, biopsy, and a diagnosis, I'm exhausted and scared. I feel like I'm stuck in a breast cancer tornado with no good options. My life will never be the same. Next week I meet with the surgeon where some major life decisions have to be made. IM trying to stay strong. I know this is a great place for all to help and support others and I'm glad I found this community.",
