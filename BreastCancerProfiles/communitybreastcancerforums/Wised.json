The same goes for the oncologist and radiologist. Some of the drugs/treatments could worsen her symptoms. If you don't like a doctor, or he doesn't answer your questions, move on to the next one. Maybe the doc that treats her MS could refer you to doctors he knows. Hugs to you and your wife!",

I told him that I was diagnosed with Factor 13 when I was 10 years old. Factor 13 inhibits an embryo from implanting successfully. He told me there is no such thing as Factor 13. I believed him. I just went through life as a bleeder and didn't know what to tell my doctors. I was re diagnosed with Factor 13 three years ago when I had colon cancer and almost bled out a number of times. I should have saved myself a lot of grief and never gone there or walked out when he told me that there is no such thing as Factor 13. But I was so desperate for a child I wanted to believe anything. Over the years I've really thought about how such a distinguished doctor could have not known something so incredibly basic. Especially since it does have something to do with a woman's fertility. Edited to add: I also had a very bad bleed on the table right after the hysterosalpingography.",

The loss of a few follicles and sweat glands shouldn't be too noticable, but the fibrosis is troubling. Hugs. So I saw my RO today and showed him my weird skin thing and apparently, I had a couple of flat, skin colored moles that are showing up bc of rads. The techs said they were a rash, but they were wrong. He said he's seen this before and frequently, they'll fall off after tx. I call that a WIN! LOL. He also echoed your explanation, Spoonie, and said that the redness and rash from rads will worsen a bit post tx before levelling off and healing. I feel fortunate that my skin has held up so far and the SE's haven't been too uncomfortable. Slather on ladies!",
