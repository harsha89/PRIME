      "Content": "Sep 18, 2016 06:14AM - edited Sep 18, 2016 06:21AM by Chemist Luna, thank you for posting this message. I had BMX + AND 19 days ago and I'm asking the same question!--when will I feel better? I have one drain left in place. But my drain output, my pain level, my energy level--nothing has changed significantly for at least 10 days. I feel like I'm just stuck. The AND armpit is still extremely painful. My surgeon recommended a few mild stretching exercises twice a day, which I do, and I go for walks as my AND pain permits. Anyway, I guess I'm not asking a question here--just venting, and thanking you for starting the thread. The answers have been interesting. By the way: I had another major (open-abdomen) surgery 6 weeks before this one, to remove a pheochromocytoma--not directly related to the breast cancer. Maybe my BMX recovery is hampered by that.",

      "Content": "Sep 18, 2016 11:03AM - edited Sep 18, 2016 12:55PM by Chemist Luna, I join you in enjoying flatness! I think it's an uncommon perspective, though. I read these posts and marvel at the pain & suffering women endure for the sake of reconstruction. Of course, I respect everyone's right to make their own choices and I understand that we all have different perspectives. Also, I agree with you about the brain-fog effect of multiple anesthesias. One of the anesthesiologists told me that they actually give a drug that induces amnesia. That's to cover the possibility that you were conscious but immobile during the surgery--any memory of that gets erased. I wouldn't be surprised if that drug has a more far-reaching effect. Question: Doesn't the compression bra stick to your scars? It did to mine. I hated having to peel it off. Stopped wearing it.",

I'm on an ac+taxol 5-month dose-dense regimen, about halfway through the ac part. For those of you on a similar regimen in this group, you must be nearly finished with the whole thing. Did you find the taxol easier than the ac? Or just different? Or worse. Many thanks for your advice, from a newbie.",

Three months after surgery, I've recovered complete range of motion in that arm (finally), but certain positions are still uncomfortable. Also, I think the recovery time depends on how long your drain(s) will have to stay in. I had 1 in for 4 miserable weeks, and that was long enough for an infection to enter through the drain, which delayed recovery even further. But 'recovery' depends on your goals. I was back at work part-time after 2.5 weeks in spite of everything, and I felt good about working. (I really enjoy my work.)",

Since (surgery+chemo+radiation), I no longer get headaches, nor do I suffer from motion sickness. Prior to BC treatments, both of those were BIG problems for me. I think it's most likely a result of the chemo, but I can't rule out other things like the anesthesia used for surgery. In any event, these are two side effects of BC treatment that will last, I hope! I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar?",

The risk of side effects may be low, but one has only to read some of the other discussions on this site to see how awful they can be if they do occur. In my case, my MO is also pushing chemo (and other stuff) strongly. So strongly, that I don't really trust her. She poo-poo's my concerns about side effects (very condescending). I think your concern is valid.",

Ever since I started my regimen of treatments a year ago, I no longer experience headaches or problems with motion sickness.
