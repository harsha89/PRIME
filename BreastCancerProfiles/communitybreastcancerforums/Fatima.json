And I have no lymph nodes involvement at all. After thorough diagnosis my brain tumors were declared benign (meningioma). My heart activiy was due to liquid accumulated as a result of taking thyroid medication. However there was no way to know I the liver is benign too without a biopsy, and I was declared stage 4 and put on a systemic chemo regimen. It has been 8 months of chemo so far and there is no change at all in my liver lesion sizes(0.2 cm change in both in latest report, but I'm thinking that's a measurement precision issue at different diagnostic centers) where as my breast tumor has melted away I am hopeful the liver tumour is declared benign. It is difficult to distinguish via a CT or US as the lesions are hypodense( cannot do contrasting) Can the liver have been affected even though I had 0 lymph nodes involvement?",

      "Content": "Fatima wrote: Hello Everyone,  I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer at the go! with a 6cm x 6cm tumour in the right breast and two lesions in the liver ( and a doubt about third tiny lesion).  I started off my treatment with AC. 4 Cycles and had no effect on the tumours.  Then, I started taking Herceptin + Taxol (330ml)+ Gemzar - supposed to be  good for liver tumours. Every 21 days. I was able to tolerate chemo rather well with minor side effects and fatigue.  After a few months, my breast tumour disappeard and I thought the combination is working great. However, after 6 cycles of combo a CT scan of my abdomen revealed that the liver lesions haven't changed much. They are still the same dimensions (5.9cm and 4.8 cm). No evidence of the tiny third lesion.  I'm scared the combo isn't working for liver mets. Or, could it be that since the tumours haven't changed much in size, the liver lesions could be benign? (no biopsy done on it yet).  I would be getting a PET done again to see if the liver tumours are active. And decide on what combination to opt for next. My onco told me that I could get neuropathy if I take more chemo cycles, and that i'll be taking Herceptin for 2 years atleast. However, he'll be deciding on an which option to go with herceptin after my scan results. Did Gemcite work for anybody to reduce liver mets in HER2+ women?   And, what other options do I have, to deal with liver mets? I read about RFA and liver resection, but also heard that cure rates for metastatic cases are very less. I read about a woman who went into remission with Herceptino and Taxol which killed a big liver tumor.   I know prognosis for liver mets is grim, but I'm hopeful I can fight back. I dream to be in remissission some day.   Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2011 01:27AM - edited Feb 15, 2011 01:29AM by Fatima Thank you all! Seems I need to find the right combination to work for me. I did not get a needle biopsy done so far because I heard it's risky. I was planning on holding off on it till I try a couple of chemo combinations. If NED or Remission means that there are no detectable tumours in the body, how is that not a cure ? If the person stays on an anti cancer diet and lifestyle after remission, can she not be NED for life and live a full life time ? I want to fight the disease and hoping for a miracle treatment meanwhile. Thank you :)",
