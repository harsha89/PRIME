Welcome Tinkerbellz I think there are a couple of gals on the starting chemo Feb thread that are doing tissue expanders that might offer some insight. I was told no deodorant in that armpit but I can use crystal or toms without the usual suspects and he also gave me some powder called Sween Body Powder.  I just spilled it all over my black sweater trying to smell it. Not bad reminds me of baby powder but definitely doesn't go with black!",

I'm a week since my last treatment and still miserable, but this too shall pass and then I'm on the downhill.  I started taking the full dose of tamoxifen a week ago and seem to be doing ok with that.
