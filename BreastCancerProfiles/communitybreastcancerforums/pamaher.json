Muscle aches and fatigue are creeping up on me. Anyone else? I started TCH in December and have two treatments left. One thing I've noticed this week (next treatment this Friday) is a lot of muscle achiness -- primarily in my legs. They feel heavy sometimes, but also tight. Stretching helps. Usually by the third week after treatment, I feel pretty good, but the fatigue seems to be creeping up on me, and I'm pretty wiped out now. Hoping the next few weeks go quickly for everyone!",
