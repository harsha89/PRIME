My sister has had a horrible year, starting with a very poor prognosis, they have looked everywhere for a primary as the markers look towards GI with one towards Breast, but unable to find a primary. Initially we were told that she was not a candidate for Y90 but after 11 treatments of Taxol and Carboplatin every 3 weeks, and the last several months every 5-6 weeks inpatient due to adverse reaction to Carboplatin and low platelets.This past January we decided to try and pursue Y90 again. Finally after all the chemo and growing toxicity of chemo, they did refer her case to IR to evaluate for possible Y90, one said she was not a candidate but the other said he would do this. She had rough time after the Y90 (only had one lobe done)but 6 weeks out they are calling her partial remission. I have been reading these threads for just about a year and feel like I know so many of you, celebrate your good news and pray with you all during these difficult times. I never intended to post,but this site has had some difficult news in the past few months. I accompany my sister to all her appointments. I have learned so much and am filled with gratitude for all the sharing and help you all offer. I felt compelled today to share our good news because I feel like some positive news is needed right now. My sister is still very weak with platelets around 30,000. but to hear that most of her liver tumors are gone was such a complete glorious news to hear. I am so happy that you are going on a trip Kaayborg, we are in the Cleveland area and being treated at UH (Dr. Paula Silverman, we love), we went on a sister trip in February ( I have four sisters, we lost our older sister to Breast Cancer 22 years ago) to California for some much needed sun and warmth. It was wonderful. I am sending positive thoughts, and prayers to all of you. It is so hard not to get discouraged but I really feel that there continue to be options and would encourage all to seek out additional opinions. Much love and prayers to you all",
