Mine is pretty cool too, called me today to check on me after chemo and offer me some support- told me to stay at home tomorrow also if needed.

Looking back, I can say that #3 has been the hardest for me so far...with the nausea and vomiting. I just had some chicken noodle soup and crackers, hopefully I will keep it all in.",

I went from my world turned upside down and the initial shock of \"I cannot believe this is happening\" to \"what can I do to improve my quality of life and not let this take over my everyday life\". The ladies on this board are amazing and full of resources. I am not in the Nyc area but I came across some info for your area. Cancercare.org offers help with cost of transportation, child care, home care and free meals delivered (Magnolia free meals at home) to metastatic bc patients. I also found that some the local churches will have a support network in place for those fighting cancer; can offer advice or connect you to other women going through the same thing for tips. Sending hugs and prayers :)",

When you feel the time is right for you, don't hesitate to switch onc. My onc has met my family, friends; I've shared pictures and told him about my fears, hopes and dreams. And he's in tune with me about my treatment. I am on chemo for life too and it's possible to have good QOL like many of us here while in treatment. You are in my thoughts. ~ hugs",
