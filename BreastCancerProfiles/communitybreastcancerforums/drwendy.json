I went through chemo before my surgery and that's enough to make sure you'll do anything in the world to help prevent future cancers.  My surgeon did not want to take the healthy lefty, but I was adamant and I'm so glad.  Practically speaking, having both off is no more difficult than having one.  You're still off work for 2 weeks, you still have stupid drains, you still have lifting restrictions for a while.  They don't take nodes on the non-cancer side so the lymphedema risk is extremely low.  The recovery is the same whether it's one or two gone.  Do you need radiation?  Because I can't imagine how awful it would have been to have the horrific armpit burns that radiation gave me and still have needed to be wearing a bra to support one floppy leftover D cup (or to go to work braless with one floppy leftover D cup...nobody wants to see that).  Now that I'm all healed up I can run and ride horses with no bra and it's great.  I have foobs (cute little B's!) that I wear under regular clothes and they're fine.  I'm gearing up for reconstruction with Dr. Khouri in Miami who is going to build me two cute new boobs out of my butt fat.  All in all I have never regretted the loss of my healthy left boob for one single second and it was absolutely the right decision for me.  Good luck!",
