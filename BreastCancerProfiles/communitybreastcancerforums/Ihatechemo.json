I normally have 110/70 blood pressure but during this whole Breast Cancer diagnosis and first 2 CMF treatments my BP top number has been over 150. I had my first Reiki session Thursday evening and on Friday morning had pre-treatment blood work. They took my blood pressure and the top number for my blood pressure was down to 124. I had no idea what Reiki was or how it works, but I was so relaxed afterwards that I am going to continue it, along with massage therapy and will be trying acupuncture next week based on the recommendations of the others on this site.

Can be warmed up if you want. I tried this and the oat bran was really grainy to get down so I kept adding more applesauce. It worked in a few hours. For 2-3 days after infusion I warm up 4 oz. of prune juice and sip that in the morning and take 1 Colace if I feel necessary. Question for those of you who had success with acupuncture: Did you find relief from insomnia, fatigue and/or hot flashes after the first session or did it take a few? I had my first session last Friday and have had no improvement. I have found immediate benefits in general relaxation from Reiki. Massage Therapy definitely helps me with clearing out some lingering post-infusion fog and general \"not feeling good\". Wishing the best to you all.",

I too was told just \"thinning\" but at this rate, that doesn't seem possible. I am only washing 2 or 3 times a week with baby shampoo and no coloring, hair dryer or anything else. I have an appointment next with hair salon that speciallizes in this issue so that I can be prepared if I need a wig. Ugh...........I HATE CHEMO. Also, I am having 6 rounds of CMF. It seems like different people get a different number of treatments. I've seen 4, 6 or 8 on this blog. Why is that? ",

I called the doctor and was told to take Extra Strength Tylenol which helped. After rounds 2 and 3 I took my anti-nausea medicine (10mg of Compazine) as soon as I got home from my infusion and also 2 Extra Strength Tylenol. I continued this for the following day. Annoying light nausea seems to linger for a few days after. After round 1 my white blood count went below 1000 so I am now given a Nuelasta patch on my arm after each infusion. That keeps my count normal but it also comes with side effects. I was told to take Claritin and Alleve (as Joyce65 mentioned above) starting 2 days before each round and for a few days after. I believe the Alleve is also helping to eliminate any headache after infusions. HAIR: Follow what Inthegrey posted - Silk pillowcase (I found one at Bed, Bath and Beyond), baby shampoo once or twice/week, no color, no hair dryer, curling iron, products, etc. I had about 25-30% thinning 3 weeks after round 1 for about a week. Then it slowed. I'm hoping and praying to hang on to the rest or the next 3 rounds. I did purchase a wig to be prepared. I also rub Cerave Healing Ointment into my fingernails and toenails each night. I hope you are feeling better.",

I could not have gotten through these treatments without the advice and support of this community! So thankful for all of you and I wish you all the best through your remaining treatments. My last treatment seemed to be the most tolerable for me. My stomach issues not bad at all. I am sticking to small meals, fiber, fruits and vegetables. Definitely still have fatigue but I am resting as needed. I know my energy will improve over the coming weeks. Nonni2015 - Yes, CMF is tolerable. You can do this! Everyone is different, but I needed the nausea med (Compazine) as soon as I got home from the infusion. That helped for the first 24 hours. I also needed some Tylenol the first time due to headache. Rounds 2-6 I was given the Neulasta patch because my white blood cell count dropped after the first treatement. That was not a problem at all. If you get that, definitely start Claritin and Alleve the day before and for a few days after. You can read earlier postings about that. Drink fluids and flush out your system. I snacked on Saltine crackers during the infusiton. If your treatments are 3 weeks apart like mine, each week you will feel better. By week 3 I felt normal. I will be thinking of you tomorrow. Please let us know how you are doing.",

I scheduled massage therapy about a week after treatment to help clean out the toxins. Both practiioners work with people in treatment and were recommended by my treatment center. Perhaps you can get recommendations about the same in your area. There was a program in my area that paid for the first 3 massages. The rest were at a reduced rate of $50/hour.",

Back to my healthy soups, fruits and vegetables. My hair thinning has continued although it has greatly slowed since Round 2. No need for the wig yet, but it gets more difficult to manage. I'm still hoping enough stays until the end. So strange though, I noticed some hair has actually grown on my legs. I hope everyone is having a good day. Thank you for being there!",
