I am 28 years old with no familial history of breast cancer. Over the winter, my nipple/areola became itchy and showed what I thought was chaffing. I would put aquaphor on it and it would sort of come and go. Within the last few weeks, it has changed in appearance. It looks a bit darker than the other, the skin thicker. I went to my gyno who thought it was fungal and she gave me a cream (it has helped a lot) but also referred me back to my dermatologist. My dermatologist wants to do a biopsy next Friday. She doesn't think it's fungal but believes it is a form of eczema (I have a history). She said it doesn't look like Paget's but I know this means nothing. I also have a mammo/ultrasound this Friday. I'm scared out of my wits that it is Paget's. The itching coincided with me getting into a new relationship which has involved a lot of, um, oral stimulation of my nipples. (Sorry if TMI). He would favor the right nipple, and now that he has switched to the other, I notice it is itchy, too. I just assumed it was related to that, but I'm very nervous now. Any advice while awaiting the biopsy? Is it possible that this is anything but Paget's? I'm a very health anxious person so this is pretty much my worst nightmare. Thanks for listening.
