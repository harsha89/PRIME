I wasn't sure I'd chime in but have some questions I hope some of you can shed some light on or at least validate what I'm experiencing. I had my first infusion (T/C) on the 11th and am feeling just about 100% again. SE's weren't incredibly bad ... at least not as bad as I had worked myself up to expect!! Biggest complaint started about 48hours after treatment and lasted 3-4days was an absolutely excrutiating headache. Nurse at my Onco office suspects it was the Zofran. I understand Zofran can cause a headache, but that severe?? I really assume it could be attributed to anything that was given to me or that I took. I'm just not sure why she immediately suggested the Zofran. Right around Day 7 after treatment I experienced terrible back pain/spasms. I'm really not sure if it was the so-called \"bone pain\" from the neulasta shot because to me it felt a little more muscular than \"bone\" ... with what I can only describe as waves of pulsating pain. It started suddenly, but occassional then turned nearly constant. I took some Rx'd Oxicodone to help me sleep. By morning it was gone. Anyone experience anything like this? Also, underneath my fingernails hurts like crazy. This started just the other day (approx 10days out). I heard nails can get brittle, maybe even fall off. Really hoping this isn't the start of this. Hair is still in tact at this point so I didn't expect my nails to be turning on me this quickly. It's not a \"tingly\" sensation either - just hurts. Per some suggestions I read on here, I did use \"sally Hansens Hard as Nails\" (applied before I was feeling the pain underneath). Lastly, my nose is very, very sore! I haven't read anything that suggests a sore nose. It's so irritated inside. Is this remnants of the drug coming out (fluid) andirritating the lining of my nostrals?? I've been using a saline spray but it does not exactly help - at all. :(. Any suggestions? I'm worried that it will never heal before next treatment & only get worse. Thanks to all or any of you who can shed any light on some of these strange SE's I've experienced. I had a lot of the \"typical\" ones as well but managed thru them fairly well. These just seem out of the norm of what I expected. My best to each and every one of you. This has been one wild ride ... and not exactly the ride I anticipated taking shortly following a 40th bday! I appreciate being in touch with others who are on this journey with me. I've talked with many who have walked in these shoes before me and who have been extremely helpful, but there's something to be said for having people there *with* you, experiencing it real-time. Long story short : Turned 40 in April, Diagnosed in June - hence the \"midlifecrisies\" surname ;-). Bilateral Mastectomy in Sept. w/reconstruction (expanders). Stage 1c, Grade 2 Node 0 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma w/DCIS, ER/PR +. 4rounds of T/C started Nov 11. Married, two kids (5 & 8). Thx all. :",

I had it cut real short prior to my first treatment - I think it was slightly less dramatic because of that, but couldn't stand it, especially in the shower. I never made it to seeing the bald spots - clumps were enough for me. I had my husband buzz it off yesterday and I feel SO much better. It looks crazy and feels strange but knowing it was all going to come out anyway, it was sort of liberating to just do away with it on mynowns terms. Good luck. It's not an easy SE we all have to deal with. And can completely relate to the \"roller coaster\" feeling. I imagine we all can. Michelle welcome and, I too, had a terrible headache after my treatment. Started around day 3 & lasted 3-4 days. A terrible tightness all the way down into my jaw. My Onco nurse suspects it could be the Zofran but I really don't know. I hope they can switch me to something else ... if they are certain it was the Zofran because I barely had any nausea so I don't want to mess with the regimine too much! Casey i like your response to all the wine talk. I asked my Onco and she asked if I drink it now (of course!) and she said then drink it (in moderation). To be honest, I had no interest in it until week 2, but taste buds were shot so I didn't bother. Once my taste came back (mid week 3) I have enjoyed a few glasses ... esp. on Thanksgiving. ðŸ˜‰ Hydration, hydration, hydration. Working on my hydration today in prep for tomorrows Round 2 (and peeing every 5 min!! ugh!). GOOD LUCK to everyone else who has a treatment tomorrow. Whether it's your 1st, 2nd, middle or LAST infusion, YOU'VE GOT THIS! It's not easy. no one easked for this in life, but it is what it is, be thankful for modern medicine (however crazy it is, it's what we have and is much better thany anything from the past) and look to the future - no matter your circumstance. And if you don't have an awesome support system at home, reach out to local services (they are out there - contact Amer. Cancer Soc) and keep coming to these boards. I have been pleasently surprised how encouraging the wonderful women are on here. When I first came on, I thought all I'd hear about was the negatives and how grim everyone's story was.

It was a good week after the 1st round, but I really only felt it 2 or 3 days after round two. It's a strange feeling but I know exactly what you mean when you say you can't do anything ...watch tv, read, deal w/commotion (my 2 boys). It's quite frustrating. I hope it passes for you soon.

The year previous to my diagnosis was full odd and random issues that brought me in to see doctors. I just turned 40 this year and prior to 2013 I could probably count how many times I've seen a doctor in my adult life (asside from routine \"maintainance\") on one hand. In that year, I was seen at least double that! Now, I didn't have anything chronic (at least that was diagnosed) but one mysterious troubling symptom has since disappeared (also post- surgery). Either way, I firmly believe it was my body trying to tell me something was wrong - i was just seemingly sent on a wild goose chase to figure it out. On a seperate note, I saw a woman out rocking the bald head today and so badly wanted to say how great she looked and start asking questions. I couldn't get up the nerve, but it made me wonder if I'll be able to just embrace the bald and move on w/life or cringe and hide from society. I actually think the bald stage might be ok, knowing it will be\"short\" term. It's the hair growing-out stages that I think will be more bothersome for me. Bald is one thing, but short, unmanageable hair at odd lengths seems worse and it will take a long time to reach a workable length. Any Nov. folks starting to lose hair? How is it going? I was treated on 11/11 and so far so good, but I just realized it's been about a week since I shaved under my arms and there's barely any regrowth (mind you, I usually have to shave daily in the summer or at least a few times a week for my own preference)!! Is this the start??! More then anything I dislike the fact that I might lose eyebrows & lashes. Really fear them not coming back ... and mine are very long/dark! Trying to keep things in perspective though. It's great reading everyones updates. I guess I will be enjoying this board more than I expected.

This, as I always add, might change as I go through the awkward growing out phases, but for the most part, I am contentwith my baldness and my family (my two little boys, included) have acceted it 100%. I have gone out to the store uncovered and although a few people may have *looked* my way, I haven't felt stared at and have only been given kind well wishes and nice comments. No pity parties. I do wear a cute hat alot because it's cold, but the wigs & wig hat that I have just don't look like \"me\" and I feel more like a \"cancer patient\" never mind look older in a turbin or the like. All that said ...... on to the \"fraud\" part. I *have* been covering up (in my cute gray hat) for the good part of a week now because I have apparently had, yet another, reaction to the lovely taxotere and now have a horrific case of folliculitis!!!! ðŸ˜ª. I cannot tell you how angry I am. As someone who was ready and willing to accept my baldness, I will not go w/out cover now!! My Onc's PA thinksit could be a reaction to shavingmy head (but I didn't use a blade - we used electric trimmers & didn't even go to the scalp so I'm not buying that). I was up until 2am last night researching and I'm convinced it's from the Taxotere crap. Now to add insult to injury, I'm reading that a severe case of folliculitis can result in balding!!!!! I'M PISSED!!!! On Fri, the PA Rx'd Cleocin (aka Clindamycin) ointment to no avail (which alone has its own host of poss SE's). I have a call into my Onco again and took it upon myself to get my PCP to refer me to a dermatologist .... thankfully I was able to get an appt for this afternoon! Seriously considering stopping treatment (at least until this clears up). Wondering if 2 doses of TC bought me anything & does it make sense to stop?? Questions I plan to ask when my Onco calls back. I'm early stage cancer and Onco-dx score was (low)-intermediate. Imjust know I will aways worry I didn't do everyting I could if I stop now. That was my entire arguement for doingit in the first place ... i didn'twant to walk away w/ammo on the table. Thought, anyone? Thanks for letting me vent here. Very frustrated ... and itchy!! ðŸ˜• ***** Update **** First off, sorry for the many typos! I really was on a rant, wasn't I?!?! I was and still am very frustrated by this new development. Derm does not think it's due to the Taxotere, but not certain and she's definitely seen worse cases (which makes me feel only a little better because my case seems pretty bad!). She spoke w/my Oncologist to make sure everyone was on the same page w/treatment (glad for that!) and they put me on a 14-day cycle of Doxycycline (antibiotic used for acne ... and preventing malaria! crazy!!). Now I worry about all the SE's associated with this antibiotic but am going to think poitive and just hope it clears up this mess! She took a culture to better define what's going on . Results should be in by the end of the week. And if the antibiotics don't work she will do a biopsy to determine what's caused it ... and if it was indeed the Taxotere. I still haven't spoken to my Onco myself but am stillvery hesitant to continue treatment until this is cleared and I'm off the antibiotic. Next infusion is scheduled for 12/26 so we'll see. ",

I've heard it's not as \"necessary\" on a TC regimen because counts don't typically fall as low or as seriously low as with other chemo regimens. My blood counts all around have been \"perfect\" so they said I didn't need it. I'm a little comcerned, especially with so many illnesses all around. Thoughts?? Too late now, but should I have insisted on it? ",

      "Content": "Nov 29, 2014 10:10PM - edited Nov 29, 2014 10:52PM by MidLifeCrisis Sort of taking a poll ... with so much talk about wearing wigs and head coverings, have any of you gone al'naturale? I saw someone out at the store the other day who was completely bald and she looked great. I knew instantly (or assumed, rather) what she was dealing with in her life but it didn't strike me as too odd. If anything, I felt intrugued by her bravery to take the situation at face value and not try to cover up (again, assuming the situation). I had my husband shave my head this morning and am really contemplating how I feel about going out in public like this. I sat with a wig consultant and even have one on order, have bought a bunch of new hats and scarves & a friend gave me her hat-hair to borrow ... but neither of which is comfortable for me, especially the full blown wig. It's just not me - but neither is a bald head. Then again, all my firends & family know my situation and should I care what strangers think?? I am fortunate to be staying at home w/my young kids right now so don't have clients or other office-related situations that might suggest wanting/needing to cover up. That said, I do woryy some about other young children - kids friends, etc - who I inevitably will cross paths with. They have a harder time understanding why \"so & so's\" mom is bald. Anyway, I was just curious about why so many feel the need to cover up and for those who don't, why they decided not to. And I will add ... so many of you who post pics, esp. of hair growing in ... you all look great and from a strangers point of view, I wouldn't have knownthe difference. ",

I see posts where people are saying salty chips tasted best ... I couldn't even taste salt! I used to love cranberry juice and was repulsed by it. For me, it seemed the more bland the food item is usually (ie. plain oatmeal, toast) the better it was. I suppose because I didn't have high expectations for its taste so it tasted *good*. I couldn't eat any fruit (except in smoothies). I've only had one treatment and my taste has come back almost 100% now at around the 14-day mark. I imagine it will go again and maybe take longer to come back, but I have been thankful. It was starting to get annoying when I was hungry but wouldn't eat anything because I just knew it would be awful! I ended up losing a lot of weight that first week. I had heard that Ensure is a good option. I haven't tried it, but will stock up before the next treatment. Also, peanut butter worked fairly wellfor me. Good luck - it seems like trial and error because like all the other SE's it varies person to person. ",
