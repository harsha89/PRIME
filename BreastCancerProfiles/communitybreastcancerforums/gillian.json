    "Content": "Feb 2, 2011 10:39AM - edited Feb 2, 2011 10:41AM by gillian It's great to read all the posts about recon or not and need some advice.  I was diagnosed with DCIS last November.  Because it showed up in two different places, I opted for a nipple sparing mastectomy and reconstruction.  I had the surgery last Thursday.  When I visited the surgeon today for my first post op visit, he said the temporary saline tissue expander is leaking.  They suspected this earlier and put blue die in it to confirm.  Who knows why it happened -- defective expander?  Expander nicked during surgery?  The surgeon says it has to be replaced, the drain put back in again, and then a third surgery to remove it and put in the permanent implant.  I had so many horrible post-op issues the first time (vomiting, pain, readmission to the hospital) that I really don't want to go through this additional surgery.  Either way, I will have to have the temporary expander removed.  Does anyone have experience with stopping the recon midway through like this?  Presumably I would still have the skin and nipple, just no volume inside it.  Would love your thoughts.  Thank you. ",
