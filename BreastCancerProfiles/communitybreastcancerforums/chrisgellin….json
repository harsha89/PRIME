It feels scary to me to hear that you are discouraged and worried. I wanted to write to you now because of the exact situation you are in. It is what I am expecting to come my way, and I am very afraid of that reality. My situation is that I have Stage III breast cancer but also kidney cancer that has metastasized to the bone--tumor near my spine. I expect that I don't have too long to live, although I have never been given a prognosis and haven't wanted one. My thoughts go to how do I adjust to what I expect is the coming reality. I still work and enjoy my family--3 sons and 2 grandchildren--and friends. BUT I just am pretty sure that the day will come when the disease starts to really get serious and result in death. It is not that I am morbid or don't have hope. I do have hope. Anyhow a discussion on how to be at peace with the dicotomy of what we live with would be useful to me. What I mean is how do we hope for life and at the same time gracefully accept the likely reality of death. For me I feel that if I can accept dying, I will enjoy living more. I want to have courage, calmness, gratefulness for what I have enjoyed and be able to be present with whatever is happening. It is a lot to ask for and to accomplish. The main difference between us and others is that we have a forewarning. I think about that diplomat that died with a burst aeorta and had no idea. (I cannot think of his name.) I hope I have not offended anyone. The last thing I want to do is cause anyone one pain. These are my thoughts, and it is lonely not to express them. My love to all of you on these Boards. I pray that each and everyone one of us finds the strength we need. Love Chris ",
