I have the panick attacks and due to the adrenaline I have not responded to the locals to numb me or meds once I arrive. I have found that this helps. Any of the Dr's can prescribe. I take one on my way to hospital or on occasion when the stress is too much. I don't drive with this. You do have to be careful because they can be addictive. I have taken 1/2 for sleeping in the past. I like this because it is not a daily anti anxiety med. It is just as needed. There was nothing ever mentioned of it or similiar types causing increased bleeding.  ",
