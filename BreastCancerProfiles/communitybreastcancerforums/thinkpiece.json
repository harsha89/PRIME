I guess I've been \"lucky\" to have had numerous recurrent primaries, same spot, and it's finally on the move. I hope it continues to poke along at this rate but they say picks up speed and strength, gah.",

Anyway, I was dx'd with IV in January 2014, and spent 20 lovely months on Fulvestrant + Exgeva shots with clean PETs, no SEs. Two weeks ago, my old lesions surfaced so I've just been 'upgraded' ugh to A/A. I'm monitoring SEs, noticing a numb finger, icky taste in my mouth, the usual. First dx'd in 1999, Stage 0, and then 2000, Stage 1; 2001 Stage 3b (bilateral + recon, chest wall involvement, second surgery for margins two weeks later), 2011 all local, no nodes, Stage 3b (because of chest wall, surgery and recon over recon), until last January's mets to bones. I have accomplished a tremendous amount over these years, in between dx's: family, friends, work, love and mostly happiness. I'm weeks away from finishing my first novel (it's with an agent) at age 59, and in ten days I go to Italy with my two lifelong best friends. Today's biggest worry is that the bad taste in my mouth from Afinitor will destroy my interest in good Italian red wine! My thought is always not how long have I got, but how well will I feel? I have prevailed so many times. Today I'm a little bit tired, feeling a little bit mopey (the meds I guess), and I'm going to let myself be late for work! Hate to be back, but thank you all for being here. Particularly love the long-timer threads ...",

      "Content": "May 23, 2011 02:16PM - edited May 23, 2011 02:29PM by thinkpiece Hi all, today is one week after my first TC cycle (25% done).  I'm back in the office, and although I feel distracted and all over the place, it's kind of nice to get out of my cave and into the real world. Here's how things have gone! My kids pixied my hair last Sunday and I fedexed it to HipHatswithHair.com.  For like $300 they make a piece with your own hair that you wear with hats/scarves.  I'm in Manhattan and went to every fancy wig place in town but it's just not me, I actually found the wigs more upsetting than the idea of being bald. I unveiled my pixie cut today and am actually getting compliments.  They are just trying to be nice! Anyway, tx last Monday was uneventful, although really long. No port, which is great. I iced my fingers and toes, and my daughter fed me ice chips while we watched Real Housewives New Jersey re-runs. Very distracting!  She's 25, took the day off from work, and they gave us free sandwiches and candy -- after 2 hours she turned to me and said, \"This is fun!\"  The fun didn't last!  I was shaky but ok on Tuesday, and worked from home -- I had that glittery, alien/fragile feeling, like I would break if someone bumped me. I got my Neulasta shot on Wednesday (The nurse said, \"No, it doesn't hurt!\" OUCH) and spent Thursday and Friday feeling physically awful, I couldn't lie down, I couldnt stand up, I didn't know where to put myself, I couldn't even look at the computer screen, it hurt my eyes, so no work. I did the Claritin/Aleve run up to the shot, day of the shot, and day after and I have no clue if it helped -- if it did, thank god or I would have been taking myself to the ER.  I wasted tons of money on food I would take one bite of and then chuck because it tasted VILE. Anyone want 6 tubs of fancy greek yogurt!? I subsisted on ice pops, Corona, and the occasional potato chip. Friday night a friend came and took me to dinner just to get me out the door.  I ate spicy lemongrass soup from the Thai place near my apartment and it was delicious -- although they say spicy prompts thrush and sure enough, next morning, my tongue is white. The physical symptoms subsided and then the dark-darkos set in for Saturday and Sunday. Just. Completely. Depressed.  Crying, moping, hiding in the bed, non-stop television - very unlike me!  My poor dog looked traumatized. Walking a 100lb standard poodle is a trip under any circumstances, but sheesh.  He's a good boy, understands something, is taking it slooowww. I cancelled lunch with daughter and she insisted on coming up to see me -- I hate having her take care of me, especially with the emotional stuff.  It just seems like the wrong way around, very hard to accept. But she goofed around and bossed me around and ... voila! Today I feel better.  Again I'm at work and it's really hard to concentrate.  But I got over the hurdle of everyone seeing me without much hair, and I'm feeling ok, and it's nice to be distracted by anything other than ME. And that's my one-TC-down/three-to-go update!  Thank you all for your stories.  They make this bearable.  I forgot to add:  OPI Envy nail hardener plus Sally Hansen on fingers (I can't take color on my fingernails) and OPI Envy and Navy Blue on my toes -- can't hurt.",
