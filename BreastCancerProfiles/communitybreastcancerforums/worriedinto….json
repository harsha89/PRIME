I am 29 years old, and about 7 months ago i found a lump in my left breast.  I don't have a fmaily doctor (bad, i know), so i went to a walk-in clinic.  The doctor said they were fairly confident that it was a fibroadenoma (sp?), and sent me for an ultrasound to confirm.  The ultrasond did confirm this, but they told me to do a followup in 6 months just to make sure. So i went for the followup ultrasound on Apr 16, and to my shock they said they think the \"lump\" MAY have grown, and wanted to do a biopsy.  They did the biopsy that day (which was scary as it was totally unexpected), and now I am still waiting.  I feel like I am going out of my mind with fear.  It has been a full week and still no results.  I feel like i can't cope with even one more day of not knowing.  I am just floating through the days feeling stuck in limbo. I am getting married in 9 months and have finally gotten to a good place in my life.  I can't handle this being something bad.  I called the hostpital that the biopsy was done on Wed and was told that pathology was backlogged so results would likely be Fri (today) or Mon.  This is day 9 of waiting.  My whole life feels on hold. My fiance has been great but I just feel like I don't want to talk to anyone about uit.  I just want to sit on my couch and let it swollow me up.  Log in to post a reply",

I haven't been a very active poster on these boards but reading everyones posts have been a great help.  There are some very strong women on here and I wish everyone well. ",
