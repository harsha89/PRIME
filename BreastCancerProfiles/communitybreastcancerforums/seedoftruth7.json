    "Content": "seedoftruth7 wrote: Hi all, I had my annual pap last Thursday and my Dr. found a lump in my right breast. They got me right in the next day for a mammogram and then sent me down for an ultrasound. The radiologost said I have very dense breast tissue and said my they could physically feel the lump but it is not showing up on mammogram or ultrasound. He said I would hear from my Dr. for follow up of possible MRI or breast surgeon. My Dr. called me back today and she wants me to see the surgeon first. I have an appointment in 2 days. My question is if this is not a cyst what could it be and just scared and confused. Will the surgeon do a biopsy or more tests or do I need to ask for those? Both my grandma's, and an aunt had breast cancer. My biggest concern is I want to be sure. If he looks at it and feels it is nothing can I still request a biopsy? Thanks for reading? : ) Log in to post a reply",
