Once it spreads it is Stage 4 unless it is a local recurrence in the breast. So stage 1 does not go to stage 2, 3, and then 4. It does go from stage 1 rightto stage 4 if it spreads. Also, tumor marker blood tests are not standard of care. They are unreliable and anxiety producing. Some people did not have elevated tumor markers at time of diagnosis. A simple head cold can raise tumor markers as can dental work or anything that causes inflammation in the body. Most of the newly trained oncologists are not doing tumor markers. .",

However, I am trying to figure out the new way to stage just put out by the AJCC. I noticed on another forum that some people were upstaged and some downstaged from their after surgery results. Does anyone have experience with the new staging? Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
