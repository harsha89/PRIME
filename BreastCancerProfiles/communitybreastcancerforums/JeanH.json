This is an excellent resource, I also found having a very current reference book to read was helpful, I am the type that needs to know. I use the 5th edition of dr. Susan love's The Breast Book, which has very good sections on explaining what your pathology reports mean and the various treatment options. Reading through this thread from the beginning will give you lots of wonderful information from wonderful women in various stages of Chemo for various types of cancer. There are other very useful threads in the chemotherapy forum that I found to be very helpful, tips for getting through chemo and more tips for getting through chemo were very useful with lots of practical information. Most of all make sure your doctors make everything clear so you are comfortable. I am starting DD EC then DD T on feb 3. My doctors go with chemo whenever the cancer gets to the lymph nodes if possible. The words they keep saying is you are young and otherwise healthy so we are going to go after this with every thing they've got to give me the best shot of no spread as possible. Sisters I hope you are all feeling better, even good today. UTAHMOM glad you are home again. ALIT your photo is beautiful. I have to upload one still. Becky, I hope your were able to enjoy the craft fair. I agree we all need large medicine cabinets, the list of meds we need is a bit overwhelming but if it helps us defeat this they we do what we need to do. It really hit home how close Feb 3 is yesterday when my Neulasta shot delivery was confirmed for next week. It seems the claritan is helping many of you, can you confirm that you start the day before injections and continue for 3 days?",

Mary Margaret when I read your post this morning I couldn't believe all you did in one day never mind before dinner!  Please pace yourself - I get the push and get things done mentality but as everyone is saying we have a long road ahead of us and want to keep up our energy to continue our battles.  None of us should feel guilty about not getting everything done (please play that back to me in a few weeks once I am hopefully underway,)  I have been thinking about you all day and finally can see you have rested some more.  So glad your solo went well. that must have felt amazing for you. I'll bet your son was proud of that beef stroganoff....My son who actually likes to cook and test new recipes is off at college so that is not going to help. DH does cook but not vegetables and not what I would call comfort food -makesa great roast chicken and killer cookies though so I am not going to complain. Welcome to all our new January chemo sisters, sorry you are in the club. Aimee, Jane,Suz3, AmyMac, tideknott, webu, starella. Hope I did not miss anyone. Congratulations IslandMom on your son's confirmation, so glad you were able to be there for it.  I don't think water bottles look odd at all :)  I hope the pains stay away today. UTMom, your walk and exercise informaton was inspirational - it's tough to walk outside with the snow ( and more is coming tomorrow) but may have to do the treadmill or bike now that I can breathe again. Hope you are feeling better, we'll hope you have low se too. Get some rest and take care of yourself.  Thanks for the reference articles on exercise I admit I have been off schedule since the diagnosis,  I started back with my Pilates class a couple of weeks ago,  now need to get more in around the work day. These articles will be additional incentive to do so. At 52 the doctors keeps saying I am young and healthy (except for the BC thing) so we are going to hit it with everything to keep it that way. Exercise can only help right. Suz3. I haven't done the wig thing yet - I guess I am waiting to hear what the chemo is.  I am starting to think I should be looking and the process may not be as simple as go to a shop and get one...I did cut my hair shorter with bangs and buy some scarves and wraps.  The look good feel better class sound fun. JulieH &vis0121 thanks for the info on grades - I went back to by pathology reports they do not state grade and in fact the surgery one is quite sketchy I think I have a preliminary report and get the full details when I meet the ONC Monday.  The initial one from the biopsy does not have grade listed but it does have the components that make up the grade and the individual scores so with that and Susan Love's The Breast Book as translator it looks like I fall in the grade 2 range.  A friend who went through this last year at MSK said the ONC visit was where they really laid it out. Julie - I have to keep checking where you are from - your descriptions sound like the cold Northeast not SC. stay warm.  Jane - I should know what my dates and regimen are on Monday.  I hope you don't have to join us but we are here if you need us.  There does not appear to be a question of whether or not I need it - ILC and 2 positive nodes seem to make it a foregone conclusion. Just when and what. ProudMom_Wife. Glad you are feeling better. our DHs and children are unsung heroes. Kym61 - hope the wig shopping was successful. tideknot/Beckie,  Welcome, My DH and I just celebrated our 30th last week last week. Congratulations.  We are still deciding on how to celebrate when this is done and Ireland is at the top of the list. We went 2 summers ago.  The first time for DH and my sons and we (DH) drove around the coast, from Belfast to Dublin, it was so beautiful, even in the rain. DH is still recovering from the roads in the west but said he will go back to Dublin again :). My parents are both from Dublin so it is always special to visit. Let's hope BC cooperates. June is a great time to go. Long long evenings and usually decent weather.  Warriorprincess24 - glad first day was uneventful. lets hope all are the same. Ipod definitely going in the Chemo bag with iPad. Definitely a techie at heart  -only problem is you cannot post from the iPad need to get back to a computer to do that (fix supposedly in the works.) Webu, I agree hearing the stories and having the ability to compare notes definitely helps us prepare... Hope all goes well tomorrow for all of you, high energy low se and lots of love and kindnesses. Jean",

I can totally relate to all the job discussions.  I don't even know what I am getting yet or when, first ONC visit is Monday due to holiday and his vacation, but am stressing already about being able to do everything, I have a demanding schedule with a lot on the calendar for this year, everyone is being extremely supportive but I am stressed trying to get everything in order before I start.  I hope to work through treatment - what ever it is.  I am realistic, I know it will not be at full speed and maybe that's why the rush now before it starts.  I thought the advice to step back and concentrate on our treatment was excellent now just have to get the rest of me on board with it.  I am hoping once I have a concrete treatment plan and not so many unknowns it will help.  I know work will be a distraction, I do like what I do and who I work with, I have an excellent team and they are all loving and supportive. I have been there for over 25 years.  I think the fact I had such a long wait between the surgery  on December 1 and  my first oncologist visit is not helping...sorry ladies I know you are all dealing with so much.  I love that we are all supporting each other, that we are sharing our concerns, tips and victories not matter how big or small.  On the other hand I think I will have no trouble taking it easy with housework :). never that great at it in the first place.  I want my energy to go to battling the beast and family. Weird in theory the cancer is out of me but it did make it to the lymph nodes so the battle continues. Thanks for \"listening\".  wish all of you the best.",

My DS is also 19 and we dad a different kind of tough ride with him but being away at college has been good for all of us...much less stress. He is such a great kid but high anxiety in high school = high stress levels at home. He is learning to loosen up, still maintaining high standards for him self but more accepting of himself and more relaxed. He had a built in tiger Mom that I needed to take the edge off.... On the positive list, the love and support I get from my family and friends and work family. Hugs upon request from both DS. If you have older sons you know this is big! The love and support and positive outlook from my usually negative about the outside world husband. A new ability to put things in pspective, working on relaxing, eating better and exercising more...more incentive to do all three.

The more in control we feel in this situation the better our outlook.  When my Dad was sick my Mom would have hard times getting the informaation she needed from doctors.  She worked at the time and had no problem getting what she needed there. I reminded her the doctors are there to help us, they are providing service to us. If she started to think of them as a vendor it would help...she said it worked.  I have been lucky with a great medical team but we have to be proactive too, keeping our lists of questions and asking them until we understand. I am building that list for my first ONC visit from all your helpful infomation.",

City kitty sounds like we had a similar experience wig shopping I went in planning to get a synthetic one but ended up spending more on human hair to fit my head and match my color. Wonder if the synthetic samples were extra crunchy to encourage that decisions I did feel like my little pony with my sisters comparing color swatches of hair on top of my head to find a color that would work. But if it works it will be worth it. Glad the iPhone tip worked. MaryMeg, the fish comparison were great. You always have a good story for us even when it is just getting the kids out to school. Tide knot love the buzz party idea, maybe it is a girls night in.

It seems to be day 14 is when the major losses start so you have another week to go after the birthday. I have read a bit about the cold caps on other threads I think you have to keep them on for 3 hour after treatment but you can travel home with them. Not sure if that will work for girls in the northeast winter...brrrr.  I am leaning towards  the hair grows back side and you have all given such great referrals for gaila, franceluxe, etc that we can  rock the turban/hat/scarf/wig look for a few months. UTMom, Hope you are still doing well and nausea has continued to subside.  Was impressed you came home and went for a walk. That's great.

Julie you are amazing at keeping track of all of us. Thank you! I love the idea of doing something fun with each treatment or a countdown - even hoping that infusion day is not too bad and can do chemo dates with girlfriends.. will give DH a break from driving into the city each time.  Everyone wants to help and this would spread out the driving among friends. Still waiting for oncologist appointment and chemo plan, turns out the wait was good as I have a bad cold now, but should be cleared by the time I see the doc. Did you get told your grade by BS? in pathology report? or by oncologist?  I have no notation on grade or stage in either the initial biopsy or the lumpectomy pathology report. I can figure out stage 2B from books and the size of tumor and the lymph node involvement but not grade. Just curious. Thank you for all the love and support from an amazing, strong, funny, group of women. It helps to have a sounding board and information sources. Jean",

The other way I found worked for me was to go straight from work without stopping home, but that seems less likely on Chemo. It seems most of you feel better in the mornings. Saw the ONC today turns out I am a February Chemo girl now. I start Feb 3 on EC DD 4 cycles then T for 4 cycles. This is equivalent of the AC then T schedule many of you are on. Apparently the shortage of A the standard in the USA has led to a substitution of E (epirubicin) in my cancer center and E has been standard in Europe, same class of drug same SE and same results. The Neulasta shot is self injected the day after tx.  MSKCC gives this routinely for all dose dense schedules. Should be interesting as my only experience with giving injections was injecting our late turtle several years ago with antibiotics (OK to to laugh, everyone else did too) , at least I will not wiggle so much ( I hope).  if my hairs follows the schedule I will start losing my hair right after Valentines Day, but thanks to you ladies I will be prepared with my wraps and scarves. Plan to go wig shopping soon now that it is definite, but not sure how I will feel wearing it, I think for work. You are so right it is a very personal decision and we all need to do what feels best for us.  I dropped a lot of RX at the center pharmacy to pick up for the first TX.  Now that I am going over my notes not entirely sure if I am getting emend or not in the IV, definitely have 3 day dose of pills that start Chemo day, steroids and additional antinausea meds for breakthrough issues. Thanks to all of you I went in prepared and educated. My head is still processing all the information. Now need to get some additional tests in prep for the TX  and wait again. Good luck to Julie and all those getting TX tomorrow. Hope the rest of you have a good day, with low or no SE. Hugs to all, Jean",

If I remember correctly the lump/rads and mX recurrence were pretty close. The reality is that the tomoxofin is what really reduces our recurrence rates since we are ER/PR positive. I basically went with why take out something that does not show signs PDF disease in MRI and scan. With ILC I think there is a higher chance or recurrence in other breast but will take that road only if and when I get there, I am large busted so the only surgery I even thought about was a reduction and at this point I am thinking leave well enough alone. I like that my breasts still have sensation and don't want to risk losing that if not required. Since I went with lUmp no choice on the rads....even decided to go with tattoos to avoid issues with markings wearing off or reactions to adhesive on stickers. My ro felt pretty strongly that Tats are the way to go, seemed to be more important since I need to do lying on my stomach. In the end you have to do what will give you the most piece of mind/best quality of life. It is hard making all these decisions, Jean",

I wanted to thank all of you for all the information contained in this forum.  I hope to be a January 2011 start - the sooner you start the sooner it will be over - right? My lumpectomy was Dec 1 and luckily clean margins, the cancer found cleared the 2mm mark so no additional surgery now. I have 2 involved nodes so Chemo  followed by rads then hormone blockers is the expected plan per the surgeon.  She told me to expect 8 cycles of chemo over 4 months. My first oncologist appointment is 1/17. due to dr. availabilty,  Can anyone tell me did they start treatment pretty soon after their first visit or is there a waiting period for additional testing/evaluation?  The surgeon/oncologist are in the same center so the records and test results are all there and available. I have ILC 2.3 cm. no idea what grade but told not especially aggressive just hard to see in mammograms, by descriptions I read stage is IIb.  I am a working mom but my kids and husband are pretty self sufficient, they are used to me working out of the house all day. Appreciate all this advice and the sounding board. It is good to have a place where you are feel to ask and not feel the need to always \"be strong\". Currently DH gets the monopoly on that part.... Good luck to you all who are starting their treatments now.  A friend who started in december suggested sucking on ice to help prevent mouth sores and a nurse friend said sour hard candy helps with the metallic taste if you get that.

The first breast surgeon i saw ordered MRI and PET scan immediately to confirm no spread since my initial biopsyn showed one node involved, they noticed swollen in mammogram and deduced to biopsy with lump. I think the ILC may have influenced that decision sine it is harder to dedect. Both tests came back clear and both surgeons I saw were very comfortable with lumpectomy. second surgeon recommended SNB first wanted to do full discesstion, I went with the second on the basis of not removing more than needed. WIth only 2 nodes involved i fell into the keep the rest category. Hi to my feb chemo sisters, i am on round 2 of 4 rounds of dd ec followed by 4 rounds of dd T. It has not been anywhere near as bad as I feared. The steroids are for anti nausea. I get emend by pill, something in IV (really should look next time and write down, they told me first time but chemo brain has wiped it out of memory :)) i take decatron (steroid) in morning with emend and nurse gives to me just before chemo as well. decatronb dose split last 2 days to avoid the fatigue that can come when it ends. I have not experienced the steroid rush. I am trying to exercise but finding it hard the first week, am hoping to be able to start walking now that the snow it starting to melt. Have been doing Pilates class but so far not first week, just some stretches. After Chemo I will have rads then hormone blockers for at least 5 years due to er+ pr+ status. probably start on tamoxifin since I somehow still test premenopausal... I am drinking lots of water too. especially the 2 days before day of and 2 days after. to keep hydrated and flush out the chemicals. Warm hands help the prink if you don't have a port. I don't have one and those wonderful Chemo nurse got me on first try both times. My center will give you a hand warmer if you haves are cold (from water bottle or just being outside) Check the 2 threads tips for Chemo and more tips and shopping list for Chemo, they have lots of great tips and suggestions for what to have on standby. The ONC and BS said even though technically all the cancer was removed and margins were clear we do the Chemo because we want to make sure no rogue cells excapes and I have the lowest risk of recurrence or mets possible so Here I am doing Chemo and Kicking cancer Butt - my sisters favorite line of encouragement! My doctor also said the sentinel nodes did their job and captured the cancer. but we still do Chemo.... I am also on vitamin D since my counts were low on the original blood test. good luck to all.

I was given an rx cream to use and theta recommend ercerin creme alternating and none for 4hours before treatment. Figuring the medicated creme in the morning rads in pm and the moisurizer in the evening. I will be on my stomach as well, combination of large breast,left side and site location I think. I am hoping to use the non wire bra I wore after the lumpectomy but much prefer the underwire support. No way I can go to work without supporti g the girls so I hope the bra is wearable. I am trying for afternoon treatments but had to give a 2hour window. Leaving for a 2:00 appointment everyday is going to be tough I hope it ends up closer to 4. Ok I have to stop stress g about what has not happened yet and see was the schedule is. I guess I will get it at the simulation. I agree we keep getting told that rads are nothing but I thinknthey will impact my life more than Chemo. I this it is the5days a week. The tattoos and vulnerability. I am worried that rads will interfer with working more than Chemo did....and it is probably the whole surgery chemo rads combination that starts getting to us. My simulation is scheduled for the 31 and rads start June 9.",

I was also recommended toms of Maine for deorderant and given a booklet from the nurses with creams to use including eucerin which I used fro dry skin during chemo. Derm that saw me at Sloan for my chemo rash wants me back before radiation to give me a rx for another cream to use proactively tom prevent rashes. I see him on the 15th I think.... Have a great weekend everyone Jean",

I am not quite a May Rads girl but I hope I can travel with you. I finished Chemo today, my simulation is may 31 (that is just under the wire for May:)) Rehearsal is June 8 and Rads start June 9. I am scheduled for 25 rads and 5 boosts. So glad to have buddies on the next part of our journey. Jean",

Worried about fitting in the rads with working, somehow this is more stressing to me than Chemo because it is every day, basically with drive there and back and the time at center it is close to 2 hours every day and the center is only open until 4....oh well it is only 6weeks. I can deal. Jean",

Since I have 2 positive nodes she said no more surgery, I would want positive enough defined, again my experience was there was one margin with a tiny amout of cancer but since it was over 2mm from the edge it was considered clear. I hope this helps. Jean",
