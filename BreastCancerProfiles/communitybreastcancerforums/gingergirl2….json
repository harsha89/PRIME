The doctor would have done it sooner, but we had vacation plans and I didn't want to have a long driving trip after  surgery. If you are really concerned about it, call your doctor and discuss it. I had a double mastectomy in August (no radiation or chemo needed, yea!). I'm sorry you are so stressed, but the surgery is not nearly as bad as you probably think it will be. I still have the surgery ahead to replace the expanders with implants.     He wanted to do it at the beginning of December, but like you, I had things to do and I don't like surgery ;).  Hang in there, you'll get through this.",
