My next MO visit will set up my 2nd rads appt where I will get my schedule and tats I get 3 weeks off between chemo and rads, they were firm about that. I haven't asked about my port but will discuss that then. It was a 3hr insertion, terrible experience and I have requested that it be removed by a different surgeon, while the RO who put it in was gorgeous, he may not stay that way if  I have to face him again LOL",

Yes, I was awake the whole time. It was unusual, as my report showed. Two Power Bards were tried, my veins run circuitous and the gorgeous imbecile said; \"In the thousands of port procedures I have done I have never seen this before\"...his words to my ears during the procedure. Different anatomy but not unique. I showed the photos on my iphone to the chemo nurses last infusion, they were horrified. It was a tough experience, sort of goes with the package. I kept the photo as I am thinking of having a Christmas card designed for him. The photo on the cover, the red is quite festive, the sport bra white for the snow and the black and blue...just for effect.",

Taxol #9 next week, lots of hair, long eyelashes mixed with stubs mixed with bald spaces. Actually, a few eyelashes look like wings LOL. No longer need a brow pencil, just a little powder. #8 was by far the easiest, I cannot say why. But I do take L glutamine and I think it really works for me regarding little or no neuropathy. I cleared it with my MO as well , I listened to medical podcasts and read medical reports which confirmed it does help SOME people. For sure it does not hurt.",

I did shave down to #2 brushcut. The sides are still thin as is the crown but the top and the back are shooting up, I am seeing a few black in between the white.  Hair appeared everywhere. My RMT suggested that I apply Cold Pressed Castor Oil to my head , breasts, brows and lashes since treatment began. I never had the gooey, weepy or crusty eyes from Taxol .There are suggestions that it helps with hair growth ( google castor oil hair regrowth) but I used it, like my mother and grandmother to reduce scaring.  It does not stain my hats or clothes. Livestrong has an article on this as well. I have no idea if using castor oil has made any difference in my hair growth, I do know it hasn't hurt and it is inexpensive. Just a moisturizer for me.",
