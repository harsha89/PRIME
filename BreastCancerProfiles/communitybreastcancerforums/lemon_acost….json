We didnt know cancer has metastasized not until when I came home to our country. She has bone (widespread), liver (take not 11 tumors!) and lung mets (small but few).  I was hesitant to let her undergo chemo because she was so thin - 90lbs. I switched onco.  We decided to take it one day at a time.  She was given centrum vitamins, eat full meal 3 x a day along with Ensure.  Slowly, my mom regained her appetite and weight. I think it was a month of preparation. Doctor talked to us about the risks and we took it. It was a family decision. We showered my mom love and support.  I did not work for 4 months not until she became stable. Believe it or not, my mom survived 16 weekly Taxol chemos.  Her bone pains slowly gone. Her liver mets were gone also. Her lung mets were controlled. Though the disease has no cure, it can be controlled.  Though my mom developed brain mets during chemo break for 5 months, we had radiation.  But believe it, she's doing fine now. Its important for you to let your mom feel that she is not alone in the battle.  Depression makes the cancer cells strong. Give all the love and support.  There are alot of medicines that can control the spreading of the disease. Before you undergo chemo, you should first get your mom's cooperation and desire to survive. This will be your first step.Ask your onco if you can give her medicines or appetite stimulant that will make her strong. When she's ready, then you can proceed with chemo. XELODA is an effective drug for bc mets. Trust your doctor but be sure that you understand whatever is given to her. Ask for a lower dosage... We can do alot for our mom. Let her feel that your her strength. Acceptance should come first, take the risk and God will do the rest. Keep me posted. We are all here for you. Leah",

When i told this to our onc he does not want my mom to take other supplements as this might complicate with her treatments. So she's only taking centrum as her vitamins now. I am also giving her Ensure twice a day. How about you LouAnn, what foods do you take?",
