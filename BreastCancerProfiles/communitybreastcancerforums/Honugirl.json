I have had an itchy, burning, cracking rash on my left areola and nipple for quite some time. In 2005, I had a punch biopsy done and the results were normal. Oncologist suggested it could be a skin irritation, eczema, allergic reaction. While the rash has never completely gone away, there are periods where it does seem to improve (only mildly itchy, no bleeding or cracking). In the past 5 months, the rash has come back worse than ever, with intense itchy, cracking, bleeding, peeling of the areola and nipple, and overall pain within the left breast. I've also noticed a straw/honey color, almost oily substance that leaks out of the left nipple on occasion. After speaking with my primary doctor, I had a mammogram and ultrasound done last week on the left breast and received a letter today informing me that \"left breast mammogram diagnostic unilateral and left breast US diagnostic unilateral showed an area that is believed to be probably benign.\"  Has anyone else had a mammogram or ultrasound with these type of results, yet still ended up being diagnosed with Pagets? I'm supposed to follow up with my primary doctor on April 9th, at which time I will discuss another skin punch biopsy. Should I request any other tests? I don't want to overreact, but I'm also concerned that this rash has been bothering me off and on for 9 years and no medication, changes in diet, detergents, lotions, soap, etc. has helped alleviate the symptoms, nor has it completely gone away. My drs keep telling me I'm too young  (I'm 34) for Pagets or breast cancer in general and seem to brush off my concerns.  On a side note, I do suffer from eczema, and have tried cortisone creams on the area with no change. It seems as if the prescription cortisone, antibacterial or anti fungal creams make it worse. Any information or advice would truly be appreciated! Thanks in advance :)  Log in to post a reply",
