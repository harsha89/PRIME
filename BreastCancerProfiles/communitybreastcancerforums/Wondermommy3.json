I've done so good the past two weeks not worrying too much and keeping busy but today it hit me like freight train and my nerves are shot! Has anyone else has the overwhelming desire to call and cancel their procedure?? Ofcourse I'm NOT going to but oh how I would love to just be able to pretend like it isn't there and maybe just maybe it will disappear ... Just day dreaming.. I know I can't be the only one to feel that way. Anyway please say a prayer for me tomorrow at 10:30am! I will let y'all know how it goes! Log in to post a reply",

Waiting to hear from Duke for my second opinion appointment but I have never heard of someone being diagnosed in their 20s, I'm 25 as it is a rare condition. Just wondering if any other ladies on here have been through this before :) Log in to post a reply",
