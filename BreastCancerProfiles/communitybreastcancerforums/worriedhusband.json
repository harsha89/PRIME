It was a little bit hard, not that moveable and it seemed rooted to the chest/ribs. She's scheduled to see a doctor end of this month but we are worried. Do these symptoms look like cancer? I don't understand when people say, \"if it's moveable it's probably not cancer but if it's rooted to the breast chances are it could be\". My wife's is not rooted to the breast but the ribs and the skin slides freely on it. Can someone please clarify \"rooted to the breast and moveable?\" Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
