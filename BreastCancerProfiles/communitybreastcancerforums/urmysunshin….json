Similar to you, they found something in my right breast as well and I had further workup... but as I also have extremely dense breast tissue, the MRI, mammogram, and ultrasound weren\u2019t able to definitively tell me what it is. So it\u2019s being watched.",

I can only hope that if I do a mastectomy that I am a candidate for the same kind of reconstruction, as that was my hope. Thankfully I live very close to Boston where there is the Dana-Farber foundation, Brigham and Women\u2019s,and great surgeons available",

Like I said, its that waiting game, and that little voice in the back of your mind saying \"what if\".  Still have to wait for the BS to get back to me.  Then I am sure she will want me to mail the US images to her.  Then again wait for her to evaluate and see what her thoughts are.  ",

Even though I told myself I would not become compulsive like I was last year I am finding myself - going to Dr. Google, reading other posts regarding cysts and letting myself slowly become consumed.  Funny thing is once my excitional biopsy was done last year and got the report back that is was B9 my compulsive behavior disappeared ;) Anyway, I just received the financial breakdown on how much my explant surgery is going to cost.  Ughh.  Not cheap.  Insurance would actually pay for a little bit of it, but because it's the beginning of the year and most of our deductible has not been met we will be paying most of it.  Way too much for our means right now. Needless to say surgery is not going to be able to happen for several months. I guess I'm going to have to just wait to see what my BS says in regards to any biospies.  You know since I have consulted Dr. Google I feel more knowledgeable about the different kinds of cysts; simple - complex.  And its the complex ones you have to worry about?  Funny thing is the radiologist never classified what kind of cysts they are just that there was \"11mm structure suggestive of a cyst\" for an example, what??  So is it or not I am wondering.  And other words like \"there are additional scattered hypoechoic to anechoic areas\", huh?  And finally the last \"Note: this exam is not sensitive in the evaluation for malignancy\" So once again the dreaded waiting game. :)",
