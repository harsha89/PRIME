I have a million questions, but am guessing /hoping I will only need a lumpectomy and am wondering if reconstruction is usually needed after. I know it will depend on the size of the mass, which I don't know yet, but am wondering if there is a magic number that makes the decision between needing reconstruction or not. I really don't want to have one significantly smaller than the other, but then again, if reconstruction is necessary, I don't want one \"new\" one and one that is 55 yrs old. I feel like I am rambling, I hope that made sense. Log in to post a reply",

Another question, since yesterday I have felt like my torso is being squeezed, it seems to come and go sometimeswith jolting discomfort. I am thinking this is stress/anxiety related and am wondering if anyone else is/has experienced this? ",

After my appointment when my Doc told me I have cancer, all I really absorbed was \"cancer\" and \"invasive ductal .....\" So I really have no idea what is ahead. I am 55 (effective today ðŸ˜„) and my last mammogram was in Jan of this year. Found the lump in May and saw my doc June 10, had two more mammograms, two ultra sounds and a biopsy. I have seen a number of posts that people are able to get copies of all their pathology reports etc, I am in Alberta, Canada and am wondering if this is something that the Docs typically share with their patients in Canada? I am hoping this emotional roller coaster slows down once I see the Doc next Wednesday, what a mix of emotions, scared, confused, overwhelmed. Thanks for reading this Carol",
