    "Content": "Reikiwoman wrote: The MRI I had on the 5th showed the following:  Scattered tiny foci of enhancement throughout left breast without focal dominant mass.  Scattered foci of enhancement throughout the right breast.  A 5 mm focus is seen in the lower outer breast, posterior third.  A 2 mm enhancing focus is seen in the lower outer right breast, middle third.  There is a nonmass like area of asymmetric enhancement within the right breast located superiorly and slightly medial.  No dominant mass identified.  BI-RADS 3 It's all Greek to me, lol.  The recommendation from the radiologist and my doctor is a follow up MRI in 6 months, unless I notice any radical changes before then. I did have my doc do a fine needle aspiration of the lump in my left armpit which has not gone away and continues to hurt.  She thinks it may be related to sweat glands, but I just want to put any worries to rest.  In addition, I'm having my PCP do a full blood panel to see if there's anything going on with me that may be contributing to my symptoms:  fatigue/exhaustion (yet sometimes can't sleep), sugar cravings, pain, etc. At this point, we'll take it as good news....and the waiting continues on some level.  ;-) ~ Gannon Log in to post a reply",
