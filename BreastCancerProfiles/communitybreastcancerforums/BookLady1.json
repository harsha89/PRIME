This blog came from the BreastCancer.Org newsletter by Amy Small-McKinney on December 10th, 2014, under the category the Breast Cancer Journey. Titled I Am Strong, I Am Not. I found it echoes what all of us are feeling, especially at this point in our treatment. I wanted to share. If I can't get it to download, I will try again when my 18 year old DS gets home!

And I am so, so thankful for all the sharing/teaching you have all done and continue to do. - Coyote, I am done! Finished my rads on 4/8/15. The Rad Therapists tossed confetti on me as I left the treatment vault. One apologized that the confetti was still in my hair after I dressed - I explained I was so happy to have hair for it to stick to! Its true, eyebrows, eyelashes, and head hair does return. Slowly, but that's okay. Rads treated me pretty well. This weekend is the worse. Some burning, rash, redness - the usual. So lucky no broken skin or severe pain. Slathered in Aquaphor all weekend. Yuck. - I'm starting Teva brand Arimidex this week AFTER my breast heals some more. We have to have some control, right? Come on, Quiggy - Jump in with me! I think we will be okay, and we are not alone. With all the positive reinforcement from everyone, including the recent messages from mqt and jean to remind us to get on with it. And, I'll be honest - yesterday I spent some time in the fetal position, weeping over all of this. But today is another day. We can do this. I'm taking a lot of deep breaths, and going to stop researching everything to death, and remember to enjoy being done with the slash/poison/burn (ha!) tx and to enjoy life. Going to a nutritionist this week (insurance paid???) who works with post-chemo patients and starting Livestrong at the YMCA next month to work on my bone density. Follow-up appts with MO and RO in May when we will work on my personal Survival plan. Thanks, Coyote, for reminding me to not fall through the cracks. XO Linda",

I have read the entire Winter rads discussion topic, so I'm ready. Dear Coyote, I have my sims 3/3 and begin radiation 3/9. Y'all have helped me so much already. I met with my RO - my DH and I agreed he passed based on my list compiled by all of the information from you - he looked a little scared when I pulled out my legal pad of questions, but I figured by the time he was demonstrating arm exercises for me, I was in the right place. I'm not sure why some discussion threads work and why some don't but this is the best. I think its because of the respect you have for each other and because of the way you share the good, the bad, and the ugly. Talk to you all soon - gotta go turn up the heater. It's 38 degrees!

Maybe a little extreme for a solution, but being bald has been the only remedy to have helped these hot flashes fro hell of mine! QUESTION - how do I care for my newly bald head?
