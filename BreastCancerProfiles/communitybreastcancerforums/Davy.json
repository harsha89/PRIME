I was dx with DCIS with comedeo necrosis grades 2 & 3 on 12/20/12 and my head was spinning for the two months following - until I made my final decision on treatment. I couldn't agree more with the other recommendation to explore all of your options before proceeding down any path. Prior to even meeting my BS she had scheduled me for a lumpectomy (we had never spoken before then!). When I told her that I wanted to explore my options, she looked at me puzzled. She said, \"Well, I'm sure I can get it all the first time.\" I felt rushed by that team of doctors to make a decision. And I was rushing myself because I just wanted the cancer out! After some time I was able to slow my thoughts enough to research all of my options and the long term implications of each choice. I got copies of all pathology, ultrasound and MRI reports to aid in my research. And I consulted several doctors. Needless to say the wonderful ladies of BC.org helped me tremendously by posting their stories and research articles. You can get through this...one step at a time. Try to organize your thoughts in a way that works for you. And don't let anyone rush you down a path you are not 100% comfortable on. Remember, knowledge is power, so begin to learn the lingo of BC. This is not a one size fits all disease, so your choices will be based on your specific situation and how you wish to proceed. (((Hugs)))",

Please don't ever let someone make you feel as though you should \"shut up\" about the state of your health. There are health professionals who will attempt to make their decision sound final, when, in reality, it's your body and your choice. I'm not saying ignore your doctor's advice, just take the time to research so you can make informed decisions. I agree with Indenial, the biopsy is the only sure way to know what's going on inside. Wishing for a good outcome for you!",

No medical professional can assure you of what's going on inside your breasts in the absence of thorough testing. Please take your health into your own hands and schedule an appointment with another center or doctor. Tell them exactly what's going on so they prioritize your appointment and not give you a date months out. Best of luck - please keep us posted!",
