Other than being devastated about the results, I learned that my co-pay is $75. Because of my bone pain, I only work part-time. I would gladly pay for someone to ship me an unused pills. I am so pissed right. I had cancer as a child. I am only 42 and will probably never get married or be happy again. My body has been mutilated. The top of my hair still hasn't grown back from Tamoxifen. I just don't understand. Why us?",
