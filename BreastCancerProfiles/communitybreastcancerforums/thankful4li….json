This most likely is a benign cyst, but it is good to get it checked out. Pain is also a good sign; most cancerous nodules don't cause pain, although some can. And all of us on these boards have been blabbering fools about this at one time or another, so don't feel bad about that. Please keep us updated.",

On the next page write down the date of Monday, the doctor you're seeing, and the questions you have for that doctor. Leave room to write your answers. Then when you are there with the doctor, go down the list, ask your questions, and write down your answers (preferably with a different-colored pen so you can easily see what you wrote). Every time you have an appointment, do the same. It's much easier if you're organized with your questions. When I have a doc appointment, I sit and think about the questions I want to ask. I go ahead and jot those questions down, so when I get to my doctor's office I won't forget to ask my questions. I hope you get good answers this week. Please keep us updated. :)",

I pulled into a space, and then I pulled through so I would be facing out of the space and wouldn't have to back up to leave. A lady and her daughter got really upset with me for pulling through, because I guess they were going to get that space. They parked about two spaces down, still gesturing rudely toward me. As we all got out of the two cars, I turned to her and said, \"the reason I pulled through is because I just recently had surgery, and it is very difficult for me to turn my head and shoulders to back up my car out of a space. You really need to think about what other people could be going through before you are so rude next time.\" Then I turned around and walked into the store. :)",
