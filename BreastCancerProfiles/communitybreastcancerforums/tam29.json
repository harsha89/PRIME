    "Content": "tam29 wrote: Nine years ago, when I was 20, my doctor found a lump in my breast. After an ultrasound and a fine needle biopsy it was diagnosed as a fibroadenoma. Since then I have been paranoid about my breasts. I check them regularly and while I haven't found anything which stands out, I always panic that I will miss a lump (I didn't notice the fibroadenoma which the doctor found). I often feel different things - general lumpiness or sometimes ribs (I think)and wonder whether I should be worried or not. I just wanted to ask what a cancerous lump is likely to feel like, and will it stand out as different. I don't want to have to keep running to the doctor every month, but I also don't want to overlook anything. Log in to post a reply",
