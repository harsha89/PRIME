Sciencegal: Is BRCA a triple negative type? or can it be ER+/PR+ and HER-?  My BS told me \"u can have bad genes or bad luck\" and I have the bad luck, so I presumed I didn't have the gene (wasn't tested for it, just presumed ER+/PR+/HER- was not a gene type of BC.) Other sisters: I have had intermittent shooting pains in lumpectomy breast since surgery and my RO said it is on the list for usual symptoms.  Yay. On a brighter note: tomorrow is \"no chemo Friday\".  Done with that 3 weeks ago.  And I'm glad to hear from you all on this thread that, generally, rads are easier than chemo and with fewer/different SEs.  I get anxious about my first rad (Monday 6/17) and reading this thread helps me calm down.  Thank you all!",

RO said I might be eligible for 3.5 week rad study.  Unfortunately, they need a clear tumor bed as shown on CAT scan.  I have dense breasts so no clear pic of tumor bed.  (sorry if this is too graphic).  So I will start daily rads on 6/17 and will have 25 sessions with additional 8 boosts.  Will take 6.5 weeks.  From some of the info on this thread the 6.5 weeks seems customary. Thank you all for you kind words of support and comfort.  Good vibrations to all!!",
