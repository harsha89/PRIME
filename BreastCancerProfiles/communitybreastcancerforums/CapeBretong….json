I had a picc line inserted into a vein in my arm for chemo, it was painless.  I was scared before the procedure.  Afterward I scratched my head and thought, wow, did I ever worry about nothing.  I'm wondering if this is what you are having done?   Take care   (((Hugs)))  Angel",

And all told her not to worry about it, it's just a rash, an allergy etc. By the time it was correctly diagnosed,(by herself on the Internet) she was stage IV. Best wishes (((hugs))) Angel",
