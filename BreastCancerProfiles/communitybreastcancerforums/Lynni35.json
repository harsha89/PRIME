Had to follow up with a 6 month mammo in June. 4 new microcalcifications showed on that mammo. Birads 4. Had stereotactic biopsy. Benign. I had to lie on a table with a hole to put the breast in, table is raised and radiologist sits underneath. Did not feel a thing. Honestly? The hard table is more uncomfortable than biopsy itself. This was my second biopsy. As my Dr told me, ANY increase in microcals is reason for concern. I am glad they are out. All removed with biopsy.",
