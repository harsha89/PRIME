I think doing all the reading from the boad here and elsewhere left me super prepared. It was all as I expected. The only glitch was apparently they did not use enough anethesia, and I could feel the cutting and sample taking. it was like a burning stabbing prickly sensation, but I thought I was supposed to feel that ---LOL--and the tech told me after OH NO!!!! You should not have felt that just pressure. Anyway it still was not bad --just localized. I had two 9 pound kids natural childbirth so the biopsy was nothing in comparison to that. The WORST thing was OMG!!! my rib cage and cheek bone ached after being so compressed on the hard board. My arm went dead too. I ask the tech if people ever faint and she said yes alot! When they get up from the procedure, they may exprience hypotension--that one day she had three women faint, but it happens in odd waves. The doctor was very sweet. I did remember to ask how many samples and she said 12. They got all the calcifications right away. I guess that is good. I bled alot; they were cleaning up for a while, but they saw everything and put the titanium clip in. I am home with my own ice packs (THANK YOU LADIES!!!!) because the one that they gave me was busted and we could not get it to break open and go cold. rofl Anywaythe Doc said she will call me Wednesday. PRAY HARD... I need good news badly... :) Lily ",

WRA called to say they have to reschedule my biopsy because the probe on their machine appears to be off. So now I will begoing in Next Monday instead of tomorrow. I swear someone just decided to take Thanksgiving holiday early and screwed up the schedule. The girl was hesitant and changed her story about why they had to reschedule. Oh well, 7 extra days then the wait for the results. Color me crazed.",

I was informed Monday, 11/17 after a second mammo (rescreen) that I have calcifications in one breast.  while I was waiting in the dark dressing room with my robe still on, the tech came in and said the first raidologist thinks it is okay but is not sure so hes having a 2nd radiologist weigh in. Next they put me in a big room and said the Doc was coming in to cover the findings.  I am a two time thyroid cancer survivor 48 on synthyroid and lo dose bp meds.

I am going between crying and walking around in a daze trying not to think about it. I am so scared!!!!!!  Here is what the report says: The patient came for further evaluation of abnormality seen in the right breast. The breast are moderately dense. Calcifications at approximately 6:00 axis, anterior one-third of the right breast demonstrate calcifications of varying sizes and shapes in a somewhat segmental distribution. No suspicious mass, asymmetry or architectural distortion is seen in the right breast. No suspcious  mass, asymmetry or architectural distortion is seen in the left breast either.  Impression: Calcifications in the right breats are indeterminate and sterotactic biopsy is recommended. No suspicious findings in the left breast Final Assessment: 4 Suspicious abnormality. A biopsy should be considered. I guess I wonder how folks read this. Also is it worse because the shapes were different and segmented? Is it just me or does it sound like a gazillion spots spread all over the place? They dont give any sizes or numbers....argh.

I hate everything about this. I was never this scared with the thyroid cancer, even though I had a rcurrence and two surgeries and am on replacement for life.  I just feel less confident less sure. So your note is the  best thing that has happened these past hours.  I am glad you told me about the tenderness.I am reading alot accounts like that. At least I know what to expect. I have a major holiday work event on Saturday so I am praying I will feel like my normal peppy self and that the results will be good.  I hope you continue to get good news and heal well.

She said come back in 6 monrths just so they can check everything. Thats all I know until i see and read what it says. Still in shock.  Thanks for your prayers and help guys.  I came here first and I learned alot. It calmed me down enough to get through Thanksgiving. The biopsy was okay.
