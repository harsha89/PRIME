Better to have a biopsy, know what is going on and move forward, even if it is more hurry up and wait. It took THREE times before I knew for sure I had cancer. Two fine needle biopsies and an excisional biospy. Six months after I had a lumpectomy and node dissection, my mammogram was not normal and I had to have another biopsy, this time a guided core needle biopsy. Everything was fine that time. If your breast tissue is dense, expect that you will be treated with extra scrutiny and remember that is a good thing, even if it is a pain in the butt. Â ",
