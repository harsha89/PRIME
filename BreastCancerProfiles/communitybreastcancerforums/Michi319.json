Well on Monday i felt a lump at what would be the right breast on the upper left side, and I am freaking out!!! I really need some advise on some questions that i have, but first let me give you some background . ok about 2 months ago i had terrible pain in my right ovary area..did an ultra sound and nothing showed up. but being my symptoms and pain, doctor concluded it probably was a ruptured cysts. I also did a Total Blood Count 2 months ago also and that can back normally (i am saying this because i do not know if breast cancer will show up in Your total blood count- like if it will give you a higher white cell count,etc). SO with that said when i felt this lump, it wasnt hard like a unboiled bean....to me it feels like the size of a chick pea...yes it is firm, and feels rubbery. Its hard to say if it moves or is set in place. And for the surface it feels smooth to me. Now this lump can only be felt sittingup. I went to the doctors today and he couldnt feel it when i lied down so i had to show him sitting up. My questions are this 1. is a breast cancer (malignant) lump hard like a bean only or can it be rubbery? 2. Would having a possible ovarian cysts make this a higher chance of being a cysts rather than a tumor? 3. when cancer is prominent in your body will your Total blood count show some kind of sign? 4. He has me scheduled for a SOnogram tomorrow- will a sonogram be able to determine a cysts vs a tumor?? 5. at my age what is the chance of me having breast cancers? Â sorry if i am alittle scattered brain on here..i just have this on my mind in so much wondering & what ifs..its a little hard to focus. Any and all questions comments and knowledge is HIGHLY appreciated :)",
