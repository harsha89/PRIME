I've never had my levels checked, but assumed I was extremely deficient as a fair-skinned woman who works full-time indoors and hadn't set foot outdoors in years without every inch of skin covered in clothing and/or sunscreen. We've been given a lot of misinformation about the \"dangers\" of light to moderate sun exposure and many of us who thought we were doing the right thing by avoiding the sun are paying the price for it now. I don't think it's 100% of the reason why I got breast cancer at 44, but I think it's got more than a little to do with it. I'm becoming a little bit evangelical with friends: get mammograms! take high-quality D supplements! go out in the sun without sunscreen sometimes!",

      "Content": "jadeblue wrote: So, I had my second-opinion surgery consult yesterday and came away feeling better about this second doctor/hospital program. She is a surgical oncologist who does only breast cancer surgery and she seems pretty on top of the latest developments. She feels a lumpectomy is worth trying in my case as DCIS area measures about .8 cm. There are two small close-together spots in my upper/inner right breast (no more visible on MRI). Instead of making a 2\" incision in my cleavage as the first surgeon suggested, she would make a Benelli cut around the areola. She said she likes this procedure because: --It gives her more room to get in there and really look around. --The scars will be less visible. (At the time of the lumpectomy, she also \"mobilizes\" [squashes around] the remaining breast tissue to fill in some of the indentation left by the excision. --If the margins are not good and I need a mastectomy, she can go back in through the same incision instead of giving me a new cut. I left feeling much more positive, especially because she also recommended using a \"bracketing\" technique to place a wire in each of the two spots for the wire-localization. This just seems more likely to get it all with good margins than the single-wire technique the first surgeon recommended. It is a bigger surgery with general instead of sedation and a longer recovery, but it feels worth it to me to do it right. Also, she can't book me until 3/23 (the first surgeon could schedule me 3/14), but from everything I understand, those 9 days won't be a deal-breaker. I also opted to roll the die and forego the SNB with lumpectomy. I know they'll have to go back and do it if they find invasive cells. But if they find invasive cells, they'll probably be going back in anyway, so I thought I'd spare myself that right off the bat (the nurse agreed with my choice). If my margins are less than great, I will not muck around one little bit: I will have a mastectomy STAT! Phew. Having a surgery date and the beginnings of a plan eases some of the anxiety. Also, no findings on MRI (although they admitted the images were not great) is nice too. Has anyone had Benelli incision (also called \"donut\" I believe) and/or a \"bracketed\" wire localization? If so, please let me know how you did. Thanks! -Jade (high-grade DCIS, .8 cm, ER-/PR-, negative ultrasound, negative MRI) Dx 3/1/11: 3+ cm high-grade DCIS + T1mic (early stage 1 IBC).

To me (and I hope that I am right!) it sounds like some pretty major but benign breast cysts. Your description of the lumps sounds more like cysts than cancer. Also I'm not sure what in your underarm would show up on an ultrasound, but benign cysts in that area are common. Finally, breast pain is not a usual symptom of breast cancer, but is present with cysts. Good luck! Try to focus on the very real possibility that this is nothing serious and do keep us posted. -Jade",

My lymph nodes are normal and I had a regular mammogram one year ago (I'm 44 with maternal history of post-menopausal stage 1 breast cancer). I have stereotactic ultrasound and biopsy scheduled for Friday morning and would welcome any info about what to expect or tips on how to prepare. My questions are a little silly, even to me, but here goes: 1. What's a good kind of bra to wear? The surgeon recommened a 'snug' bra, but what does that even mean? Sports bra? Just a regular bra, but maybe my tightest one? Other, please explain? 2.  Uh, OK...I am barely a B-cup and am a little concerned that my breast won't hang down enough to fit through the table. The doctor said I will probably have just enough boob to fit (well, she didn't say it quite like that). How small is too small for this technique? 3. Am I totally insane to consider going in to work after this? Probably, huh? I would like to conserve sick/personal days in case I need them later, but I don't want to push myself too hard either.

If you wait and it DOES turn out to be something, you'll always wonder what might have happened if you had the biopsy sooner.",

Dr. Susan Cash and Dr. Holly Mason of Baystate Cancer Center are both surgical oncologists who do only breast cancer surgery and are trained oncoplastic surgeons -- some of the best in the Northeast at achieving nice cosmetic results post-cancer surgery. For plastic surgeons, Dr. Pranay Parikh of Baystate Plastic Surgery Associates and Dr. Glenn Brooks, private practice in East Longmeadow, MA are both excellent. (Dr. Cash and Dr. Parikh are my BS/PS team for BMX with TE reconstruction and I highly recommend both. I had a nipple sparing mastectomy on prophy side and this team was very comfortable with and knowledgeable about the procedure.) Best of luck to your sister.
