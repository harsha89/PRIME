For me I madly searched the internet, that is how I found this place, but I know if is full of doom and gloom as well.  Talking to my younger sister, who was diagnosed at 35, 10 years ago, was very calming for me, just talking to someone who understands and have some insight into the fears was, for me, very helpful. Hope you are getting some sleep, the best soother possible. big hugs Helena",

I have just had my exchange surgery (only 1.5 hours) and it seemed to knock me around more than the bilat mastectomy.  Energy levels vary drastically during the day - I'm a runner and to be zapped like this is horrible - I totally understand, but I also realise that to get the best result from all these surgeries we have to relax.  I napped today and here I am up at 2.44am and can't sleep!!!  Just my thoughts but I coped amazingly well through the bilat mast and immediate recon surgery, both physically and mentally, and I found a few months down the track I collapsed emotionally.  Perhaps I wasn't coping all that well on the inside.  I fooled myself I guess.  We need to really look after ourselves inside and out. soft hugs Helena",

The anticipation is worse than the fact and we left it for so long that I almost felt embarrassed.  It feels so good to be so close to another human being.  I did mention once on another thread that it is a bit like child birth - your DH sees \"the war zone\" down there and it takes a while for them to rid that picture from their mind.  Time... time ...time.

Personally once you get the oncotype results back I think that overrides the need for a 2nd opinion.  Oncoptyping is held in quite high regard now.  The problem lies of course if you fall within the intermediate range where the pros and cons of chemo is still uncertain - I am assuming this is why you have joined the clinical trial (is it tailorX??). There is no way of knowing or guessing what your oncotype result will be as the results are so individual - same diagnosis can produce varying oncotype scores.  You don't have long to wait now though.  I have my fingers crossed that you have a low score and you can forget all about chemo and a 2nd opinion.

Reading up on the internet can be beneficial and helpful but can also fill you with dread and fear.  You don't know what you are dealing with yet so please try and stay calm and you can come here to get a cyber hug and empathy.  We have all been there and understand the turmoil you are going through now.  I'm not sure how to deal with your anxiety/panic attacks but you sound like you are doing the right thing seeing professionals and getting help. Try and have someone with you when you get your results and when you have your MRI - its useful to have a second pair of ears, regardless of whether the results are good or bad. sending you big hugs Helena",

I had a very bad 12 months leading up to my diagnosis with hormones and thought I was heading into menopause.  Nope, heading into breast cancer.  I am almost 100% ER & PR positive so I'm sure it is linked.  And yes, there are many good outcomes here.  Although you are frightened, rightly so, you also sound very intelligent and switched on.  It is a bit of a no mans land at the moment but once you get the total picture you can plan a way forward which can give you something to focus on and feel like you are fighting this crappy disease. big hugs Helena",

Please let us know how you get on.  Thinking of you. soft hugs Helena",

Quality of life going forward means not just trying to beat this damn disease but having courage in your convinction in whatever path you choose. This is a horrible time, I remember it so vividly and I wish you all the best in your decision making. big hugs Helena",
