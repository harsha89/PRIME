I have two sisters and a daughter and each of my sisters have a daughter. I am almost paralyzed by the fear I have and I dont know if it's because of my mom or myself or my family. I work at JC Penney's part time and have limited benefits. Maybe it's an excuse or maybe it's fear, but I don't want to go have a mammogram. I want to rage against something, i just dont know what. Can someone help? Cici Log in to post a reply",
