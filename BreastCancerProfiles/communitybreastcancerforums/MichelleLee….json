After reading up on cording, this sounds exactly like what I am experiencing. My whole inside arm feels bruised when touched. I will also reconsider taking Tamoxifen after so many others have encouraged me to at least give it a try...thanks for the advice and I wish you good health!",

BS said the incision would be about 2\"...came out of surgery with a 5\" incision starting at the nipple going straight up ending inches below my shoulder. Good news, path report showed clear margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all negative. Almost 3 weeks post surgery, still in a lot of pain...worst in my armpit and pain goes all up thru the inside of my arm down to my hand when I reach out or up with my arm. Incision still looks quite welted, puffy, stings all the time, but not red. Is this all normal or should I be worried? I see my RO this Wednesday to get tattooed and measured for 6 1/2 weeks of radiation. Hope he can tell me things are looking and feeling normal...also MO wants me to start Tamoxifen after radiation, but I am considering not doing it because of all the horrible side effects. Advice?
