Spent 5 days in the hospital because my WBC count went to 0.8 on the 10th day mark after chemo. They finally told me i will have a shot tomorrow called Neulesta i believe. I heard it hurts your bones. And some says it doesnt do anything to  you. i guess i will find out. What really scares me i see people who have had a stage 1 and now have mets. That takes me by surprise when drs. tell you it is best to catch it early. Me being BRCA 1+ really effects me because now i have to worry about my  4 babies when they get older.",

I am scared of course,but the doctors tells me it is the best thing to do with me being so young and I am BCRA 1 positive. I am not looking forward into it but i will do what i have to do. They are putting me on Taxotere & Cytoxan x4. I had a Bilateral MX on Nov 30th and with this cool weather it is not helping my aches in my muscles.  I will say a little prayer for everyone.",
