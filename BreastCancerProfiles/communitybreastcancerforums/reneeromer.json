I hope they have a look-see and you don't have to get the biopsy. Fingers crossed for you!!  Rebamacfan, Thanks for your comment! It really helps when you connect with others sharing the same fears and experiences. I went and bought 4 dresses today. It took my mind off of the waiting for a little bit. I just want to know so that I can start fighting or be a rock for those fighting. This experience has changed my life.  xoxo",

I felt where the pain was and sure enough there was a lump. I already had a referral to get a mammogram so I scheduled it the next day letting them know I had felt a lump.They said they couldn't see me until JUNE 5th!! I asked if they had other facilities they could send me to and they found an earlier appointment somewhere else. When there, they focused on the lump. As soon as the mammogram was done, they had me wait for the Radiologist to look at it. I was then sent in to ultrasound. After that, I had to go talk to the Radiologist. She told me that the lump was moderately suspicious and that I needed a biopsy. I was scheduled two days later. And here I am today... waiting for the results. It's not easy. Many scenarios go through your head. But see if there's somewhere else you can go. THE WAITING IS THE WORST!! Crossing my fingers that all will be good for you!!! We are here!!",

I knew it was going to be an ordeal. I spent 2 months wondering about my diagnosis because although it was deemed benign, they needed to take it out to make sure. Anyway, I know how you are feeling. The best part of your day is when you wake, before you remember what's going on in your life, right? That was the best part of my day, at least. Well, all ended up being ok. I have two large scars and my breast is smaller now but I was spared the \"C\" word. I spent my time worrying, crying, preparing. However, if it happens to me again... I will spend time NOT worrying, NOT crying or preparing, but with the attitude that everything NEEDS to be and can be ok. I know it's easy for me to say... now. But you will be so much stronger after this. You'll be proud of yourself that you got through it and that you will be able to relate to all these women who need our words of encouragement. This was my saving grace... this site. I may not get to wear the pink ribbon for myself... but I know how it feels to be on the brink of being able to. I will wear it for all the women who need my support and love. I hope all goes well!!! My thoughts are with you!! Hugs!!!! Renee",

I had been feeling pain in my right breast off and on for a few months but I had an iud and thought that it might be just a side effect from a non-existent period or hormonal. I recently lost about 10 lbs and noticed my breasts were less dense. So I felt where the pain was and noticed a lump. Great. I had just gotten a physical early April and my doctor didn't feel any lumps (or missed it), but wanted me to get a mammogram anyway. Since I already had the referral, I called and made an appointment and let them know that I felt a lump. Got in right away. They did a mammogram and ultrasound. Scary, scary, scary. The radiologist called me in to discuss. I saw a dark mass, oblong, looked huge to me. She said between low, moderate, and highly suspicious, that mine was moderately suspicious. She said not to think cancer. I don't know if that was to ease my nerves but she also said that my lymph nodes were clear so that is a good thing. I go for my biopsy tomorrow. My emotions are all over the place. I'm prepared to hear the worst when the results come back but I am so scared as well. Trying to get through the day is tough. Trying to not cry is hard. Trying to act normal is torture. Anyone have a similar story or words of encouragement? Thank you in advance oxox Log in to post a reply",
