It's a measurement they can get from your blood labs. They can track the size of the tumor and see if it's shrinking that way. Your tumor is pretty similar to mine and we both already did the surgery. So they can't measure those markers on us during chemo. You will learn a lot in a very short period. Kinda like drinking from a fire hose! Lol. Peruse through the October and November boards and you can see experiences from ladies who are going through it right now. It's scary, but it's doable!!

They actually upgraded my staging at my MO's appointment. There was an error on the Pathology report. So I went from 1B to 2A. Boo! Aldea12, you should pull up the Chemo tips and shopping lists thread in the Chemo main folder. So many survivors have contributed to that. It will really help you understand what's to come. And remember, everyone deals with the chemicals differently. But certain drugs do tend to have certain effects. Pmevans50, when my port was installed on Tuesday, they gave me two little pillows that some local ladies makes in memory of their friend who passed away from BC. It was very touching. I drove to work this morning and used the little pillow to protect me from the seatbelt. Such a cool feeling that \"Mildred\" is gone but helping me. One of the tips I read from someone else is to take Thank you cards and catch up during injections. I'm definitely going to send their church a thank you card. I was also pleasantly surprised on the port install. Mine was under general anesthesia, but I came out of it right away after surgery. Today is my second day after surgery, so I could shower and clean up, YAY! Not being able to shower is punishment for me. I'm in very little pain and have very little bruising too. My BS was female and I think that made a big difference. I feel like my placement couldn't be any better. When I came out of surgery, I noticed that my bandages were cut out in the shape of whimsical cartoons. It's the little things, right!? Thinking about you ladies tonight and sending you positive vibes. Sounds like a few of us start next week. We've gotta be in the right mindset! Night! Rachel",

When they install it, within 3 minutes, it injects you with the needle and leaves a small catheter in you. So the \"snap\" is already done. It will inject the meds through the little catheter. I've been taking Claritin since Sunday, so hopefully, I'll skirt around the bone pain. By tomorrow at 9pm, I can take the patch off. A best practice to share..I wore a long sleeved shirt with fitted cuffs today and I basically had to strip for them to put the Neulasta patch on. You can't knock it off, so they didn't want me to pull my sleeve back down. I had my sweater, so I just put that on and closed the front. So you will want to wear something that will allow them to access the port and access the back of your arm (opposite side of your surgery.) Also, the lidocaine cream works well. I used a qtip to apply about a pea size. I'll use more next time and won't use a qtip that soaks up some of the meds. I used a small square of cling wrap over the site for the hours prior to my labs. That also allows the nurse to touch and feel where the port is, without rubbing off the meds. I have a lot of allergies, so I consider today a success that I didn't have a reaction to any of the meds. Injection #1 done. 7 more to go. I'm intentionally not allowing myself to \"wait\" for the SEs. I'm keeping busy and when they kick in, they do. I don't want to be like \"what was that? or that gurgle.\" I think that will just amplify the anxiety. Oh yeah..liquids.. I've had about 84 oz so far, shooting for another 28 oz before bedtime. The nurses made a great point that I hadn't thought about...drink it while you can, because if you do vomit or have the big D..you can't replace as fast as it's coming out. She also said that if you're not feeling great, you may not be able to force yourself to drink. So, I'm trying to stay ahead of it. I heard the steroids made a lot of folks jumpy and wired, but I'm not really getting that effect. I stay really busy, so it was kind of nice sitting still for 2 hours today. I'm heading to the couch for more! Good lucky, Kelly! I'll be thinking about you tomorrow.",

I felt normal the day after chemo and then your worst days, you'd be home. I find that working is a great distraction. My coworkers are very supportive too. I'm sure they'll wanna see my head as soon as I shave it. We are like family. That definitely makes it easier. We look forward to hearing how round 1 went.",

Leslie, The Neulasta shot is a sticker on my arm. It can't get wet. My shot goes off at 5.30pm tomorrow. It takes about an hour. Heating pad on my neck tonight. It's got me thinking. I'm wondering if my headaches in the first round were really from the Neulasta. I think it may just be the chemo chemicals. My headache isn't bad, but it does feel like the previous ones on day 3-4 last cycle. Might mean it can't be the neulasta, since I haven't gotten it this cycle yet. Interesting. Have a good night.

Taking Claritin (yes, an allergy pill) can help with the bone pain, as well as Alleve. I started Claritin 4 days prior to the Neulasta injection and will take it another few days after too. Check with your MO on the Alleve though. Some MO's want you to take Tylenol since your liver is already taxed from the chemo meds. Which meds are you on?",

I'm doing the baking soda/salt mouth washes a few times per day, and been eating normally, so fingers crossed there. I love to cook and I'm a huge foodie, I sure hope I don't have any aversions.

My orthodontist immediately told me he could give me fluoride if I needed help combatting those issues. I'm on day 11 and haven't had any issues. I am doing the baking soda and salt mouth rinse regularly to keep the mucous membranes in my mouth healthy. I also told my MO about the fluoride and she said to let her know first if I had issues, because she would have something better. Nanpop, we all have rough patches, and we are allowed! I mean we are fighting cancer after all!! I agree with Sleepless, you are much stronger than you know. About a week ago, I got out of the shower to dry off and started realize all of my incisions that I had to be careful around. A 4\", a 3\", a 2\", and a small one on my neck. I feel like the bionic woman. They put me on all active birth control pills to control the pain of my fibroadenomas, so skipped a few periods. Then my MO took me off all birth control pills, because I'm 98% ER receptive. Now I'm being told chemo will stop my periods potentially forever. My body is ready to give me the finger! My point being this: spend your precious emotions on the things you can control. In my opinion, the worst of this disease is the unknown. I'm much better eqipped to deal the pain and stomach issues. Maybe reward yourself with something after every big feat, give yourself some incentive. In the end, know this..we are all the same boat and you can release as much as you want here, there is no other group that could understand anymore than the November ladies! Coupon, it's normally about day 14-17. Mine is coming out more than usual already on day 11, but not in clumps yet. Shadowcat, our tumor traits are similar. What meds will you be getting? Bclibrary, is your appetite good on the bad days? If yes, you should be eating some clean proteins. Your body might not have the fuel to fight back. I agree with Leslie, make sure your MO knows, they may make some changes for you. Latinmxy, I'm right behind you on second injection. I go on Wednesday. Good luck!",

But also because chemo is killing all the cells around the body first. Then radiation is targeted just to the tumor. Most women doing neoadjuvant chemo (prior to surgery) see the biggest results from the chemo. The radiation is more like fine tuning. Bg46tn, you're going to hear \"everyone is different\" a lot in the next few months. And it really is the truth. Every woman's body and psyche can deal with things differently based on previous life experiences. Every woman's tumor is different and many doctors prescribe different drugs to combat the SEs. Hear what the side effects are, but don't predestine yourself that it will occur for you because you dwell on them. Like Leslie, I had zero nausea, just bad headaches. I go for #2 on Wednesday. I am also working full time, more than 40 per week. Keep yourself occupied and busy, if side effects pop up, deal with them. I will caution you about constipation, also known as C. Most of us are learning to take something to counteract the nausea meds. I will take miralax every day that I take nausea meds. I drink 120 oz of liquids every day to pee out the meds faster and to keep your intestines lubricated. So many before us have survived the next few months. Remind yourself, this chemo is curing me, not saving my life!!! LIvingonaprayer, not having the progesterone receptor doesn't change much, just you hormonal therapy after chemo and surgery. Natster Latinmxy, good luck tomorrow and Tuesda, can't wait to hear how it went! Hey everyone, I bought the cookbook \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen!!\" Check it out on Amazon! It's killer!

I suffer with yearround allergies anyway, so I'll just stay on Claritin through my whole AC experience. Cindy, that is seriously something to cheer about!! I would love to be delivered that same news. My tumor was really small too. 9mm. I'd be elated to go straight to Tamoxifen after my chemo and skip rads all together.

And because Taxol is a taxane and can cause reactions, they push the infusions insanely slow. I'll get Benadryl, antinausea meds, and steroids first. Then a very slow drip on Taxol. They said it's a 4 hour injection. Add in labs, waiting, and a visit with the MO...voila 6 hours. They said if you have no reaction after the first 2, then it'll be much shorter. Aldea13, I get the Emend pills for days 1-3. I have Alox and the \"detha\" steroid in my IV. The Emend is very expensive if insurance doesn't cover, Mine does cover it. It's by far the best anti-emetic out there. It borders on miraculous for me. I've had zero nausea for either of my injections. We will see if I'm as lucky with this one. My MO backed down the IV steroid so I wouldn't gain weight. I'm cool with that. 😁 Nanpop, a big kiss to you for saying that! My husband and I juice every day. All organic fruits and veggies. I think that's a big part of it. I have good energy and my skin tone has greatly improved. I lather my face daily with good moisturizers (free from the LGFB class). I have to laugh that body has probably not been this healthy in a long time. Leave it to me to be the most healthy during chemo. Only a scant adult beverage here and there (I was a pretty big wine drinker), tons more water than im used to, better spiritual life, requiring more rest for myself, and getting my vitamins from the juicing. I'm feeling pretty balanced. I stay active, 5,000 steps+ on weekend days. Hoping to keep that up! You can add baking soda to your mouth rinse, that helps. I do 1 cup warm water, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda. So far no mouth issues for me. I have braces on too, so I wasn't really worried about it. Marie, that's a good nap!!

I have a very small incision at base of my neck and an incision above my left boob that appears to be very well placed. Anesthesia was much easier this time, I haven't napped since I've been home. Sorella, surgery recovery wasn't too bad for me. The axillary node incision was definitely the worst. Just more annoying than anything since I'm right handed and it was right side. I did have a seroma about the size of a tennis ball. My BS drained it and it was instantly better. Hoping this port will go as easily. My veins are very small and fenicky, so port was a must. I think she used a triangular power port, so scan injections can run through it as well. I hope you guys have a great night",

Natster, my MO told me to limit caffeine, but if I experience C, I may have a cup to see if it'll get things moving! 👍 I take one more Emend pill tomorrow and then go to the Zofrans every 8 hours.

You could suck on ice chips too. What medications will you be on? Leslie, yay!! Happy the baldness is tolerable. Probably less than a week til I'm saving mine off too.

Some amazingly good makeup in my kit too. I'm quite sure this is TMI, but ya gotta laugh....started my period today. Hopefully this is the last one.

I'd freak if my mom was there too, cause she would make me anxious. The port surgery was about 75 minutes, with really only about 45 of it being the surgery. My BS used the neck incision to thread the catheter to the power port. My actual port incision is about at where my cleavage starts. Don't be scared to demand your BS put it in an area that suits you. I didn't want my bra to rub it and I like to wear lower shirts. A lot will depend on your chest structure. The thinner you are, the more it will show. You can see my catheter, kinda just looks like a being sticking out. Dbear, good luck!!

I've been taking antinausea meds day 1-5, then I quit. The others can let you know if they quit sooner. To me, nausea is what I feared most.

Haven't shaved my legs or my armpits for over a month now, that's a serious silver lining!! I made a gallon and a half of bone broth today. We are making homemade pho on Wednesday night. I figured that would be great for treatment day since it counts as liquids too. Thinking about you ladies!!  Rachel",

I felt normal from Wednesday-Friday afternoon. Then like clockwork, the Neulasta pains kick in Friday night. Friday night the pains were a little different, I could tell it wasn't just Neulasta. I got out and about on Saturday, but was very sore in my knees. I just felt a little unstable. Was in the recliner Saturday night til 1am with terrible leg and knee pain. Woke up Sunday feeling much better. I did an Epsom Salt and peppermint oil bath. That helped a lot. I did a 3 mile hike today, I feel about 85%.",
