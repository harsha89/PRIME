Something just doesn't feel right with the right breast but I don't know if I am being paranoid or if I should make another appointment to see my regular doctor or what. Just wondering what would be the next best move? Thank you all again ladies for your words of wisdom and your willingness to help and listen. Log in to post a reply",

Now, when I went to do my SBE this month my right breast is enlarged and I have a dimple that looks like a thumbprint at about the 11:00 position that starts outside the areola but extends a little bit inside too. Also, I noticed a milky discharge during the SBE.  I am not sure if I should go in to the dr again or wait until I have a follow-up appointment with her on the 26th.  I don't want to seem like I am being paranoid or looking for things that aren't there.",
