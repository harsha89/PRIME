Im so sorry to hear about your discomfort...I was the same, and used that expression - it feels like someone is sandpapering an open wound! I am now just over 4 months out of a mastectomy & lymph node dissection - I would say it took at least 2 months before my wound felt comfortable enough to massage - prior to that it was a horrible feeling and felt way too tender. The sydrome pain I get is mostly in my underarm down to the elbow, and my shoulder blade - it didnt let up for me and my doctor prescribed gabapentin about a month ago. This has helped enormously and even driving is comfy now where it was unbearable before! It is still a big relief to get all my clothes off at night though and pop on my cosy pj's! I wish you a speedy recovery Mom2two! Sue x",

I had a mastectomy but no rads or chemo...just tamoxifen. Best wishes to your friend, Im sure she will be fine...if rads were seen as needed, Im sure it would have been done. Sue x ",
