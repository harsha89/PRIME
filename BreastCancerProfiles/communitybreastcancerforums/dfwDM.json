At MD Anderson they will allow you into the radiation program protocol (SBRT, Proton's or other) with out having to wait for pain or SRE's, far more aggressive plans for bone only mets in Houston.",

We know that among other things these cells are bTub negative, which leads to knowing that Taxol (and the other Taxanes) will work well, for now. Chemo is effective, but for many reasons is limited, this is well known. As far as radiation being difficult, that is a fact. Our wide been (35 treatments) to the surgery area was very difficult, heavy burns, pain level was high. It seemed very aggressive. We understand the SBRT/gamma knife and Proton Therapy are much different. MD Anderson meeting is about 10 days away. regards",

PET scan showing clear bones after chemo (6 months ago), but 3 tumors are back last week, three of the originals. Illiac arc, L2 Vert and sternum. Tumors are small. We want to add the SBRT treatment but it has not been recommended by our team, can any share their experience for advocating or finding doctors who believe that an oligometastatic state can be cured? We are headed back to chemo again, and our thought is simple.... why do the same thing and expect different results? Warmest regards dear people. Doug ",

If the tumors persist after chemo or causes you pain we will move forward.\" Our own personal experience tells us that chemo will shrink (for now) the tumors, it has not removed the same tumors in the past. Our feeling is that doing the same thing just prolongs the life of these few tumors, giving the disease more chance to spread. These same tumors have lived on through DHPx6, Xeloda and Tamoxifen. Continuation of partial success is palliative and we worry that it will lead to resistance, mutation and spread. We are fine with systemic treatment, but want to add the SBRT in hopes of turning a corner. MD Anderson consultation on April 2. We are dealing with Paclitaxel now.",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2015 09:22PM - edited Apr 2, 2015 09:26PM by dfwDM Update on MD Anderson consultation. We consulted the radiology department at MD Anderson. We have been told that the data is not that good but it is good enough to make a judgement decision. They will move forward with the Radiation treatments with curative intent (not waiting for pain and SRE's). It was described as a short window of opportunity to treat what may very well be oligometastatic bone tumors. Since these tumors were not removed by chemo, we have been advised that chemo will most likely not ever be able to remove them and that it's best to ablate them now. We were offered the opportunity to suspend chemo (weekly Taxol) and go straight to the Proton therapy, but after discussion further the group (including the head of radiology at MD Anderson) want to map the four tumors with a detailed MRI, finish the 3 month Taxol and the ablate the tumor beds with something like Protons and SBRT as appropriate. It was explained to us that in a new research effort that is finished, but not published, MD Anderson will be defining a new statistical data set for Stage IV patients who attain an NED status. This data has already established an oligometastic protocol for MD Anderson for patients with three or less metastatic sites. We have four sites, so a few details will be added to our case (the MRI). They were encouraged that these four sites are four original sites from the first scans a year ago, not having spread and much smaller. MRI in a week or so. Then we finish the Taxol and then ablation. They also said........ \"no promises\". However, for the first time since we have started this fight we feel like we have been evaluated not as a standard statical unit but as an individual medical case. Our appreciation for the time and consideration from MD Anderson is very high. Bless you dear warriors. Fight on.",
