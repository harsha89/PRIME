My DH is a wonderful man, but he truly doesn't want to hear about it. His attitude is not to worry until you really have something definitive to worry about. He'll go on about how the odds are in my favor. While I know that is true, I also know that handling the situation this way is his method of managing his own brand of anxiety. I have seen a therapist in the past, but mostly to address relationship issues. But maybe it's time to reconsider the meds.",

I can tell you that I don't stress over routine lab work, and even my colonoscopy was a snap compared to the mammograms. I think the difference is that the colonoscopy isn't something I have to face on a yearly basis. Had it when I was 50 and was told no need to return for 10 yrs. unless I felt something had changed. With the mamms, I always feel that the clock is ticking. Defies logic, I suppose, but that's what it is.",

Faced my fears with the dreaded annual mamm yesterday, got it done, and left with an \"all clear.\" As far as I'm concerned, I don't need a darn thing under that tree in a couple of weeks. I've already had my Christmas. I felt my anxiety lessen a bit when I saw which breast imaging specialist was assigned to do my screening. I've worked with her before, and she shows a genuine sensitivity/concern for my issues and is in no way dismissive. Didn't realize until last night what a physical toll this anxiety takes on me. Totally exhausted but still too wired to relax, if you know what I mean. So will definitely consider advice given here so far regarding \"situational meds\" in the future that could be helpful on a short-term basis. I've said for years now that if breast cancer doesn't kill me, the fear of getting it surely will. So I know I've got to find a better way of coping. In the meantime, I thank all of you again and so appreciate your support. Let's all hope and pray that diagnosis and treatments continue to improve, but better yet --- a cure for this and all cancers. Blessings to all of you. ",

The fibroadenoma that was found years ago is stable, and no one has ever recommended removing it. In 2010, I had an intraductal papilloma that was removed during the course of an ultrasound-guided core biopsy. My annual mammogram is scheduled for a week from Saturday, and the stressing already began weeks ago. I've struggled with anxiety my entire life, but the mammogram takes it to new heights. One friend has said that at least I should give myself some credit for getting the testing done. Another has told me that if it freaks me out so much, I shouldn't go because the statistics for NOT getting breast cancer are in my favor (she is 67 and hasn't had a mammogram in years). My husband is sick of hearing about it. I am finding it increasingly difficult to control my obsessive negative thinking. I find myself touching my naturally lumpy breasts at every opportunity. I thought about my upcoming appointment all through the Thanksgiving holiday (we had dinner with a friend who is a survivor). I feel like I can't even think about Christmas until I find out that everything is OK. I feel as though it's not a question of if, but when, the other shoe will drop. I've tried all sorts of stress relief techniques, and none of them work. I don't want to take any anti-anxiety meds. I know I probably sound like a wimp to those of you who are already staring cancer in the eye. But does anyone else experience anxiety to this extent, and if so, how do you deal with it?

Just reading about the recent study that found that false positive mammograms increase your risk. I know that in terms of actual numbers, this only adds one or two more women being diagnosed over a decade. I also know that there are women at high risk who never get bc, and women with no history, etc. who do. I just pray every day that someone will find a better way to diagnose and even more importantly, to cure this d--n disease.",

So I do give myself credit on that account. I know that early detection is critical for any type of cancer. And I do think I need to reconsider going the med route to keep the anxiety in check. I guess I was just brought up to think that taking meds is a sign of weakness. Closely aligned with my anxiety is guilt. Yes, I've had abnormal mammograms. But after further testing, everything worrisome turned out to be benign. So then I think of all the people who weren't so lucky, and the guilt spiral begins. Ugh! Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom, and I will hold positive thoughts for you.  ",
