The general surgeon watches me now and will release me next month to be checked by internal medicine dr for the rest of my life where the nodule is concerned. I have  never had a pet scan but biopsies are the only true way to get results as far as I know. Good luck and keep us updated. Karen",

The opinions are across the world as some techs are not as nice as others, density is different with age, cysts and other conditions may make it more painful-there are so many factors to consider. For my follow-up in Feb. 2008 I am considering having digital as they will be getting a new machine at a hospital in town-the first! Good luck. Karen",

If it makes you feel better then do what Sheila recommends-the choice is up to you so that you are comfortable. Our thoughts are with you. Karen",

I had the mammotome vacum assisted and the needle only goes in once. With the core, I've read it goes in several times. Local anesthesia I had, I hardly felt anything. I felt the sting of the needle and some light tugging, pulling sensation and that's all. I had slight bruising for a few days and my scar is tiny compared to a surgical biopsy I had 8 years ago which the scar is at least 2 inches long! http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?PG=breastbixr Try this website for more information and another  http://www.imaginis.com/index.html it has a lot ofinformation as well.
