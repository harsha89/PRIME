There's growing evidence that a bisphosphonate drug helps prevent bone mets. I convinced my onc to start me on Zometa last fall.",

Like ChiSandy said, if you needed general anesthesia as is sometimes given for an \"open\" biopsy, like a lumpectomy, you'd need to be NPO (empty tummy, no food or water). With an ultrasound guided core biopsy you'll be awake, with a couple of injections of a local numbing medicine before the larger core biopsy needle is inserted. I had this procedure myself and it's not bad at all. Like getting snapped in the breast with a tight rubber band. You can eat or drink beforehand.",

Everyone thought, no problem, let's pop it out of there, and all will be well. Lumpectomy, with sentinel node biopsy, and it turns out my armpit nodes have cancer that so completely filled them that they could not absorb any of the radioactive tracer or the blue dye. A full axillary dissection revealed six affected nodes. Stage III. When I went to my surgeon's office after the lumpectomy to get the drain out and hear the full results of the pathology report, I left there in a haze of grief and sadness. I don't know how I managed to drive myself home. That was almost seven years ago and I'm doing great. The treatment roller coaster was no fun, but manageable. Really. You can do this. My advice now is to take one day at a time. Don't try to predict or conquer the whole thing--it's overwhelming. Right now, today, you can get up, make coffee, play with your preschooler, and trust your doctors to help you. The shock will ease with a little time. And if you'd like to read about my experience, which feels like a couple of million years ago, there's a link in my signature to a blog I wrote.

I had many surgeries for reconstruction--only one of them a big deal--but list seemed to scroll down the page. My initial chemo was six rounds of TAC (taxotere, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide). It's a very common regimen. My most annoying side effect was constipation. Seriously. After my first round, I wan't able to drop the kids off at the pool for almost a week and I was truly miserable. For the next rounds I was prepared, and started taking stool softeners, miralax, and metamucil a few days before the chemo treatment. I was never nauseated and rarely tired. Occasionally muddle-brained but it didn't last long. The only thing that didn't taste OK was overly sweet stuff, including diet soda. That's a plus--I broke a bad habit and never went back. My rads were pretty intense due to the way my BC presented. I had daily treatments for 37 days (not including weekends), and each treatment lasted about 20 minutes. Yes, my skin suffered, but the rads \"mopped up\" whatever cancer cells the chemo and surgery might have left behind. My rads side effects were related to skin issues. Uncomfortable, but not terrible, and worth it (in my opinion).",

The tiny surgery to put it in was nothing. They gave me sedation and I don't remember a thing, and although my chest was a little bruised and sore afterward, it wasn't bad. To help get it in a comfortable spot, put on your favorite comfy bra and use a Sharpie marker to dot in an outline of where your bra edge and straps lie. This will help your doctor to NOT put the port directly under your bra cup or strap. Having the port made treatment much easier. No more stabbing around to find veins, even for lab draws. I wasn't sad to see it go, but it did its job and I was glad to have it when I needed it. Try not to stress about the port. For me, anyway, it was a great tool that helped me win this battle.",

I learned, AS YOUR WIFE MUST LEARN, that sometimes I needed to preserve my privacy and peace of mind and change the subject, not answer the phone, or just leave--\"whoa, look at the time, gotta go!\" It's her choice. She shouldn't feel forced to have any conversation with anyone, and she should feel OK about looking a little indignant and saying, \"You want to know about my prognosis? Why do you ask?\" \"Now my wife is stuck in the middle of something she would have never agreed to.\" Your wife is probably very kind and hesitant to hurt anyone's feelings.

It could be that in the beginning, all the crazy pinkness served the purpose of \"coming out.\" In the distant past, breast cancer was something of a shameful disease. People didn't talk about it. Women ignored symptoms until they were dying. We needed a social reformation to make it okay to say the word \"breast\" and okay to talk about breast cancer. We've done that. We're reformed. Now, after my experience with breast cancer, when I'm exposed to the celebrations and ribbons and balloons, I think about friends who died ugly, painful deaths. The hoopla just feels wrong. My son urges me to quit being a sorehead and be thankful for the fund-raising for research, and maybe I should. Actually, truth be told, I really do like the color pink. I hate that it's become the color of the disease that tried to kill me.",

The pillow-type foobies are soft, light, and comfortable, and were very handy when I was healing from the surgery.  In fact, now that I'm healing up from radiation, I still wear one occasionally when I'm wearing the right clothes.  With tops that don't fit close to my body, the fluffy foobie looks OK. All in all, though, the silicone foob looks more natural and matches the other side better than the pillow-type.  Especially with tee-shirts and close-fitting tops, the difference between your fluffy foobie and your natural breast would be more apparent than with the silicone model. The silicone one's heavier, too, and \"behaves\" like a real breast.  When I first put it on (or in, I guess!) it feels heavy and weird, but in a couple of minutes I just forget about it.

At the same time...like a friend who'd been there told me, \"IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.\"  This is important.  When you tell people, including your parents, and they fall apart, this sets you up in the comforter/soother role, and that's just not fair.  In my own experience, I told family members either on the phone or face to face, and then I threw it on FaceBook and let the news trickle down.  I'm pretty open with everyone and everything, so this worked for me.  I asked people if they wanted to be included in a \"news receivers\" email group, and I send out updates now and then, usually related to another step in the journey--beginning of chemo, end of chemo, surgery, radiation, etc.  Other women prefer more privacy and control over their news, so you'll find a way that works for you. When I encountered people face to face, I allowed them to reel a little from the news, but it ended there.  If someone got dramatic or intrusive (and some did), I developed phrases to politely and kindly shut them down.  I didn't need the negativity, and I didn't have to just swallow it.  Neither do you.  Remember--\"it's all about you.\" Blessings and warm wishes as you step forth on your own journey. ",

Both the PET scans and tumor markers have been reassuring for me.  Before my last scan in May, I had been having some back problems and soreness in my thigh and was a bit nervous that something was growing there.  When the scan came back normal, it helped me tremendously to connect the dots--not every twinge is cancer! As far as I know, all of us with a breast cancer diagnosis can consider ourselves completely \"cured\" when we die of something else!  As lousy as that sounds, it gets easier as the months and years go by.  I know breast cancer can still pop up somewhere and throw a stick in my spokes, but it doesn't haunt my every thought like it used to.  My mom is 90-year-old.  She had a left mastectomy with axillary node dissection in her 60's, and a right simple mastectomy in her 70's.  She's cheerful, active, and healthy.  Is she \"cured,\" \"in remission,\" or \"NED\"?  It's a matter of semantics.",

Of course, you can refuse ANY treatment, but radiation is used to \"mop up\" any stray cells that might be hanging around the chest and underarm, and it's very effective at preventing local recurrence. For us Stage 3 people, they throw the kitchen sink at our cancer--chemo, surgery, radiation, hormone therapy if ER+. Current radiation technology is amazing. It's designed very precisely to radiate the tissues involved and avoid other organs as much as possible. The presence, or lack, of breast tissue doesn't affect the radiation design.

To think about the future and the good things it holds--for me, it's grandbabies, retirement, travel, and time with my family.

No lump.  I saw the doctor IMMEDIATELY and had US and biopsy.  The tumor was very close to the surface but very tiny-- 0.8 cm.  My surgeon did a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy and was surprised to find malignancy in the nodes, so performed an axillary dissection.  A month later, a skin biopsy of the pink spot showed dermal lymphatic invasion.   I just finished six rounds of TAC and will have a single mastectomy on 4/18, followed by radiation. Then we'll wait six months for the effects fo the radiation to settle down and then do a preventive mastectomy on the other side with a DIEP Flap reconsctruction.  Yes, it seems like everyone else has surgery, then chemo, then radiation.  But every woman's cancer is her own unique journey.  Breast cancer doesn't follow a script.  My own experience with TAC was that it was nowhere near as hard as I had expected it to be.  I work full time managing a medical program--administrative, desk work.  I had chemo every three weeks, on a Wednesday.  Wednesday and Thursday were fine, then came \"chemo Friday,\" when I felt like I had the flu without the sore throat, fever, and cough.  Just fatigue and achy, and a cognitive fog that felt like someone had stuffed my head with wet cotton.  On Saturday the fog rolled out, and by Monday, it was back to work, riding my bike, doing the dishes, washing the floor.   So each round I took three days off.  I really only needed Friday off, but Thursday was my \"reward\" day to sleep in, ride my bike, do my nails, stuff that's fun and lazy. This is my first post.  I've been lurking quite a while, a little irrationally scared that if I looked around this website it might mean I really have cancer, but now that I'm here, it's nice to know I'm not alone in this.

But I do know that there are lots and lots of us who had very serious (Stage 3) diagnoses, and are many years out. Statistically, your chances of cancer NOT coming back are better than than it recurring. A friend who had already finished treatment told me she imagined a \"delete button\" in her head. When her thoughts took her to that dark place, she hit the mental delete button. You haven't been out of treatment very long, and the \"elephant in the room\" is still stomping around your house, pooping on the rug, and breaking furniture. It takes a while, but the elephant shrinks into a tiny mouse that lives in the wall and squeaks from time to time. When I was first diagnosed, I had \"cancer radio\" playing in my head 24/7. Now, I hardly ever think about cancer. It just takes time. Right now, though, I think you should find a therapist or counselor that works with people who have had cancer, and talk about how you're feeling. The fact that EVERYONE fears recurrence doesn't change the fact that it's wrecking your peace. I promise you, there are better days ahead.",

I saw a 3\" \"red spot\" on the skin of my breast one morning, with peau d'orange texture within it.  My gyno sent me for mammo, then ultrasound, then biopsy of the 1.2 cm lump that was just under the red spot.  It was IDC, and everyone thought it was tiny, very early, pop it out with a melon baller and we'll be finished.  So I had a lumpectomy. The lumpectomy had clean margins of the small lump, but the sentinel node was positive, so my surgeon did an axillary dissection.  We were all surprised (...horrified...) when the path report came back with 4 out of 28 nodes involved.  I saw my new oncologist not long after that, and she was the physician, out of all that I'd seen already, who wanted a biopsy of the \"red spot.\"  So when I had my port placed, my surgeon took a big chunk 'o red spot, and it was filled with dermal lymphatic cancer emboli.  It was in the skin. Game change.  Now we were throwing the kitchen sink at my breast.  First TAC chemo, then a unilateral mastectomy.  I'd wanted to remove both at the same time, but my plastic surgeon wanted me to keep my healthy breast intact until reconstruction.  Then 38 radiation treatments, and my radiation oncologist didn't want a tissue expander placed; he wanted the targeting of the radiation to be perfect.  Wait, wait, wait, for the effects of the radiation to settle down.   Nine months after my last radiation treatment I had a DIEP recon.   I'm happy with my choices.  Yes, I've had a lot of time in the operating room lately, but after spending a year with one boob, I either wanted to be flat or have a semblance of both breasts.  I hope this helps!  Please feel free to PM me if I can answer any questions or be helpful in any way.  And just know...you WILL get to the other side of this huge speed bump.  The fear and shivers, the \"cancer radio playing in your head 24/7,\" will get better.  Blessings to you as you navigate through this.",

I'd done a lot of research online and discussed the gepartrio trial with her, although my own cancer characteristics didn't exactly match those in this particular study. It also helped that my cousin's husband is a big-shot breast cancer researcher and he advocated for me as well. Eventually we won her over. However...plug this consideration in, as well...cancer cells, like rats, are smart at evading capture and execution. When breast cancer is Stage IV, the treatment process is to give a chemotherapy drug until it stops working--the cancer cells have figured out how to overcome the chemo--and then move on to the next drug. It could be that by blasting my system with Xeloda and Navelbine, if I ever DO progress to Stage IV (Heaven forbid) these drugs might not be effective for me. I can see by your signature that you've thrown the kitchen sink at your own breast cancer, and I don't know...this might be the point where you need to trust your doctor, do your best to eat healthy and exercise, and live your life. Believe me, I know the fear and uncertainty in your heart. But there are better days ahead. I promise. Please feel free to PM me if you want. I'll be here for you. (edited for typos)",

      "Content": "Jan 25, 2018 02:47PM - edited Jan 25, 2018 02:48PM by sbelizabeth Chelleb, here is my honest opinion. Occasionally we read about someone who found a mysterious \"something\" on her/his breast, and either ignored it, or saw a doctor and the doctor brushed it off as being inconsequential. Later, the person discovered the \"something\" turned out to be IBC, and the story goes, \"if only I had seen a doctor!\" or \"if only my doctor hadn't brushed me off!\" Stories like these sometimes make people freak out about a very minor bump or rash or bruise or itch that they discover on the skin of the breast. Inflammatory breast cancer can start in a number of ways. Sometimes it's a purplish bruise-looking area. Sometimes it's a rash, or a reddened area, or the breast suddenly becomes swollen, red, and hot. Occasionally there are swollen lymph nodes in the armpit. It's a very rare form of breast cancer, but of course, it CAN, and does occur sometimes. That's why women and men should be vigilant about their breasts, know the signs of cancer, and be familiar with their own \"normal.\" But IBC, to my knowledge, never presents as a little pencil-eraser kinda bump. Or a mosquito bite, pimple, or ingrown hair. IBC may initially present as a subtle bruise or rash, but it progresses rapidly. And truthfully, if BCO had a nickel for everyone who posted here describing a mosquito bite, pimple, or ingrown hair, and were terror-stricken that it might be IBC...well, let's say BCO wouldn't need to do any fund-raising for a while! Please, Chelleb, be at peace. You've done your due diligence and consulted your doctors, who assure you that you don't have cancer. Don't let yourself spiral down into a place of \"...but what if...\" Turn your thoughts and focus away from this, and toward whatever it is that fuels your life. If you find that you can't pull your mind out of cancer thoughts, it's time to see a mental health professional. Blessings and gentle hugs--SB",

But my right side is unaffected and I get injections, lab draws, and BPs on that arm. I had both knees replaced in the same surgery in 2016. One IV in the right arm, BPs done on right arm. After anesthesia recovery I was snoring in my regular room for a couple of hours, when the physical therapists arrive to help me walk to the bathroom. Oral pain meds only. They really, really don't want you lying around after surgery. Up and at 'em. An IV in the foot or leg is just not frequently done. The circulation is poor, it's an infection risk, and some say it can increase the chances for a blood clot higher up in the leg. If your team insists on two IVs, don't worry about the jugular. It's an easy stick and it's done all the time in the emergency department. It won't be there for long. An arterial line would be placed in your inner wrist above your thumb, right where you feel the pulse. It's an easy way to keep track of BP, but knee replacement surgery is relatively quick, and an arterial line sound like overkill (so to speak...heh...). Still, if you don't want BPs done on your upper arm, it's an OK alternative. Can you have an arterial line and an IV in the same arm? Technically yes--one's in an artery and the other in a vein, so they don't get in the way of one another. Congratulations on getting close to your new knee! I love mine. They're straight, strong, and painless. Blessings--SB",

      "Content": "May 31, 2018 03:42PM sbelizabeth wrote: Duckmomma, good luck tomorrow! Hoping for reassuring news. Since the topic of IBC is on the table, be aware that a mammogram and ultrasound can sometimes miss the subtle signs of IBC, particularly if there's no lump present, which is frequently the case with IBC. Occasionally a slight skin thickening is the only clue on mammogram. Since IBC is cancer that is clogging the lymphatic channels in the skin of the breast, a skin punch biopsy of the area with the rash is most diagnostic. Sometimes even a skin punch biopsy can miss the cancer emboli in the skin, but it's more sensitive of a test for IBC than a needle biopsy. Tomorrow, when your radiologist goes over the results with you, my advice is to specifically ask about the rash, specifically ask about skin thickening, diffuse enlargement of the breast, stromal coarsening, diffuse increased density, or enlarged lymph nodes. EVEN IF A LUMP IS FOUND, discuss the rash. Here's my story: I found a 3-inch circle of pink, swollen skin, with peau d'orange texture, on my breast. On mammogram and ultrasound, a tiny (1.2 cm) lump was found that turned out to be malignant on needle biopsy. Everyone ignored the pink, swollen \"umbrella\" of skin above the lump and and zero'ed in on the small lump, until a lumpectomy was done and it was discovered during surgery that a sentinel node biopsy was impossible--my lymph nodes were too clogged with cancer to absorb any of the radioactive material or the blue dye. An axillary node dissection was done that revealed many affected nodes. Only afterwards was I sent to an oncologist, who insisted on a biopsy of the suspicious skin, which, of course, was chock-full of tumor emboli. Things shifted into high gear after that, but I lost precious time before beginning chemo, dancing around with that lump. I'm telling you this just to give you more knowledge, not to scare you! I'm almost seven years out from that chapter in my life, and all is well. My sister was diagnosed with IBC nine months after me, and she's thriving as well. Whatever lies ahead--whether it's heat rash =) or something else, you can get through it, one day at a time. SB",

Just so you're aware, it's unusual for those of us with ER+ tumors to have complete pathological response (no detectable cancer cells in the removed breast), so I don't want you to be dismayed if your path report isn't what you're hoping for. Probably because I'd been bit in the fanny so frequently with bad news of my breast cancer, before my mx I was very much hoping for a complete response, but nope. There were still cancer cells in my breast. However, I had great margins and the cancer cells were now in a jar on a shelf somewhere, and off my own chest. I sincerely hope your path report has happy news for you, but if it's not 100% spectacular, remember there are lots and lots of us who were in the same boat and are living life with no evidence of cancer.

Anyone who was premenopausal before breast cancer treatments, and still has their ovaries, can emerge from \"chemopause\" and begin cycling again. It may be weird, irregular, light, heavy, whatever. It may settle down again into monthly cycles, and you can definitely be fertile, so if you don't want any surprises...birth control. That begin said, abnormal bleeding should be thoroughly checked out by a doctor who knows your BC and genetic history. Breast cancer rarely spreads to the uterus, but it can, and there can also be primary uterine or ovarian cancer completely unrelated to breast cancer. Most of the time, unexpected, light bleeding in these circumstances are related to hormonal changes and medication, not cancer.",

I had lived a year with a prosthetic form on the left side and my natural breast on the right side, and I didn't much care for it. I agree with you, I would have preferred going flat altogether, but my plastic surgeon wanted me to wait for the non-cancer side because it gave him more skin to work with. I wanted the non-cancer side off, too, because my BC sneaked up so hard and so fast--I wanted to minimize the chances of that happening again! Given the choice between implants and going flat, I would have been happy to go flat. My mom's been flat for many, many years, and she loves the freedom and coolness (she lives in Arizona!). With the DIEP procedure, my \"breasts\" are soft and warm, and since the surgery was done a long time after my radiation treatments, I didn't have to deal with rads ruining anything. Good luck.

Then he sedated me so quickly I don't even remember lying back down on the OR table. Octogirl is right, spinal or epidural anesthesia is great for post-op pain. Also, when I was barely awake in the recovery room, they were placing catheters in my upper thighs, and using ultrasound to direct them to the nerves that supply the knee. Then the catheters were connected to \"On-Q\" pumps--little tennis-ball shaped devices that slowly and continuously drip numbing medication and controls post-op pain. The catheters stayed in for a couple of days. It was remarkable how they controlled the pain and let me get up and walk. Sher, I would guess they'll put in the arterial line after you're sedated, and remove it before you're fully awake, so don't waste much brain power worrying about it. Same with the jugular line. My biggest annoyance with this surgery was my doctor's insistence that I wear thigh-high anti-embolism stockings for a couple of weeks. I really hate those things. But now I'm enjoying my strong, straight, pain-free legs. And my chronic lower back pain resolved too--who would have guessed my crooked, unstable knees were causing it?",

A mammogram and ultrasound revealed a small 8 mm lump beneath it, and suddenly all attention was turned to the lump. Needle biopsy = invasive ductal carcinoma, so a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy was done, which revealed involvement of several nodes. It wasn't until I saw my oncologist that the red area was addressed. She ordered a biopsy of the skin, which revealed dermal lymphatic tumor emboli. I think you're right in considering a skin punch biopsy, perhaps in more than one place on your breast. Consider making an appointment with an oncologist, too.",

Lots of eye makeup and dangly earrings--a friend said \"you look like a French model.\" My favorite thing was to come in from a chilly bike ride, fill the tub with hot water and just plunge in, wallow like a dolphin and not have to worry about my hair! I didn't lose my nails at all. My big toenails looked like they had a darkish stain, but it was no big deal. I did lose every hair, everywhere. Another interesting experience! For the first time in my life I learned to put on eyeliner. My doctor pretty much insisted on a port, and I'm glad she did. No digging around for veins, no worrying about the chemo leaking into the skin and causing mischief. I totally get it with the \"I feel fine!\" weirdness. I'm going to endure months of intense treatments and surgery and drugs...wait, what? I'm not sick! But think of it like whacking a poisonous lizard with a baseball bat before it has a chance to turn into Godzillla. NY30, please feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions I can answer for you. Good luck, and blessings.",

Most radiation oncologists recommend at least six months, some longer, to wait for radiation effects to settle down.  Radiation makes the skin thin and fragile, and it doesn't heal as well.  The body needs some time to recover.  I'm very happy with my DIEP reconstruction.  With this procedure, slabs of skin and fat are removed from the abdomen, along with their blood supply, shaped into \"breasts\" and attached to the chest, using microsurgery to attach their blood supply to new vessels in the chest.  Thus, you wind up with a tummy tuck and \"breasts\" that used to be abdominal fat.  No implants. Are you seeing doctors who practice at a hospital that is also a cancer center?  There might be a nurse navigator available to help you.  I considered the captain of my team to be my medical oncologist, and I trust her.  You need to find an oncologist who is willing to explain, teach, and listen.",

(4) Never allow yourself to dwell on the wish that this or that had been, or were, otherwise than it was, or is. God Almighty loves you better and more wisely than you do yourself. (5) Never dwell on tomorrow. Remember that it is God's, not yours. The heaviest part of sorrow often is to look forward to it. The Lord will provide.  ",

The prevalence of metastatic disease is high because many women live with this disease for several years; there is however, a major lack of accurate data on this prevalence in the great majority of countries since most cancer registries do not capture relapses. As there are significant variations in outcomes of early breast cancer among different regions, the burden of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) may differ from that of early disease.\" (Italics mine.) There is no data in the article that relates rates of recurrence according to country, region, age, treatment, or any other variable.  Yes, the quote is terrifying.  Yes, I worry about recurrence.  But when I plug my stats into CancerMath or PREDICT, they sure don't give me a 70% chance of relapse.  I would be interested to know exactly from what population the 30% / 70% statistics were culled. ",

The flu vaccine should be injected into muscle. The deltoid (arm) is the most convenient place, but the hip (butt) works just fine. At our clinics we're prepared with screens if someone wants their shot in their hip. Bigdogzmama, if you had your underarm lymph nodes biopsied during surgery, you should be careful with that arm, and if both underarm lymph node fields were biopsied, you can absolutely request your shot in your butt. And, as an afterthought, everyone needs a TDAP -- adult tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). Your childhood immunizations can wear off and like Lita said, whooping cough is on the rise. It's a miserable and serious disease for us grown-ups but can be rapidly fatal for babies and children. No one should even come close to a grandchild if they haven't been immunized. There, that's my commercial for the day. Healthy autumn, everyone.",

The surgeon will get better symmetry between both breasts, but first and foremost, I can stop worrying about something sneaking up on me in my remaining breast. Like you, my tumor didn't image on mammogram and I had an \"all clear\" mammo in June 2011.  In September 2011 I found my own cancer, which turned out to be small but node-positive.  Yes, fear might be a factor, but I don't care.  I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling my remaining breast and axilla for tiny but deadly lumps.  Good luck.

The Zometa took more time to give--an hour in the same darn infusion room where I got my chemo--and it made me feel like I had the flu. Fever and aches. The Prolia is just a quick shot in her office, and I feel fine afterward. Giving a bisphosphonate (Zometa) or similar drug (Prolia) still is not the standard of care for bone mets prevention. My MO had to dance around my insurance a bit, because I'm not osteopenic (yet, anyway). My sister lives in Colorado and her MO never spoke of it to her. I have urged her to ask about it, but she's not the loud mouth in the family.
