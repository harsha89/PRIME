My hair looks like a cross between a mullet and an old man's comb over. I'm obsessed with wanting to be done and starting the regrowth process. I think you are right about, the hair will grow when it grows. Of course there is no magic pill or shampoo but the advertising makes us belive that there is. I will most likely buy some product and hope for the best. Always a silver lining...... Make up, earrings and a smile alwsys work! ðŸ˜‰ðŸŒ»",

The first time I had chemo I lost all my hair. This time during chemo I decided to use the cold caps. It has not given us the results we thought we would get. I can't go out of the house without a head covering. I have a little bit of scraggly hair and just enough to make a baby sized pony tail. So at least when I wear a cap, it sticks out the back. I've lost it all around my ears and top of my head. It looks a little bit like my Dad's comeover. Not pretty. I have one more treatment left and am looking forward to the regrowth process. It should be interesting to see the new hair grow in with the long strands of hair. My hair dresser is going to have to really put her thinking cap on for this one. My question is..........there are so many products on the market that claim they help your hair grow in faster. Have any of you used any with success? I've heard of Nioxin, Fast, Keranique, Art Naturals' Argan Oil Shampoo Hair Growth Therapy, PURA D'OR Anti-Hair Loss Premium Organic Argan Oil Shampoo (Gold Label), 16 Fluid Ounce  I found this helpful: Now that you've seen the best organic shampoos, here's where you can learn about what makes them powerful against hair loss, dandruff, excess oil, and dryness. Sulfates, also known as detergents Why do organic shampoo manufacturers avoid sulfates in their products? Research has linked sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS or SLES) to cataracts in adults and poor eye development in children. It may also irritate oil glands and dry out the scalp. It's known by a few other names like these below: Sulfates can create a nice lather when you wash your hair, but you don't need lots of suds to clean your scalp or hair thoroughly. Parabens What are parabens and why do organic shampoo companies avoid them? Parabens act like estrogen in the body. A high concentration could cause breast cancer and problems with reproduction. Some places in the world ban these chemicals outright, especially in cosmetics and products used by children. Avoid methylparaben and propylparaben, for example. Alcohol Certain kinds of alcohol will dry out hair. Avoid shampoos with regular alcohols except these fatty alcohols listed in the ingredients. Fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, or lauryl alcohol. Synthetic perfumes and colors Organic shampoos smell good because of natural herbs. Avoid chemical formulations that could dry out your skin and hair. These ingredients often have a FD&C or D&C number instead of a name. Formaldehyde Ick, remember those bottled frogs floating in formaldehyde in biology class? You're alive, not dead, and you certainly don't need this preservative on your hair. It can actually make you lose more hair. Here are some things you may notice as you change to using organic shampoos. Please note that organic doesn't mean it's like baby shampoo. If you get organic shampoo in your eyes, it will still burn like any other shampoo would. You may find that you don't have much lather without chemical surfactants, especially if you have hard water, but that your hair feels cleaner anyway. You may find that you look forward to washing your hair. This is good since organic shampoos often have an expiration date. They don't rely on preservatives to stay fresh. Although you'll probably pass through a transitional phase of a few days to a couple of weeks, you'll notice a difference. At first, you may wonder if the new shampoo is doing the job because you may get more tangles, dryness, or even oiliness as your hair and scalp heal. Then you'll start to see positive results like shine, bounce, and softness. Your hair may feel and look thicker and any dry flakes should clear up. Experts with experience using organic shampoos recommend a few things to help your hair transition and thrive. Soon you'll be the one recommending organic shampoos to your friends and family. here's the link for more info https://gettheglitter.com/best-organic-shampoos-re...",

I'd like to say that most people are kind but sometimes people do surprise me. I've learned from the 1st time I was going through treatment, that so many people just don't know what to do/say. Never mind the ridiculous strangers at the grocery store, but people that you know just don't know how to handle it. Some friends/family will surprise you with their kindness and caring and others will disappoint.

WOW! Spaghetti and meatballs. I wish. I've had diarrhea so am eating a pretty bland diet. need to figure out more protein snacks. it's better for me to eat more small meals right now. VLevic: I've heard the week after infusion is the worst and the week before is the best. It's been a week for me now and the joint pain is gone but the diarrhea is still here. Do the people at your job know what you are going through? are you reducing your hours?",

I have been feeling great this week and not looking forward to starting on the roller coaster again. I definitely had annoying side effects (diarrhea, nose bleeds, joint paint, metal taste in mouth, mouth sores, insomnia, heart burn just to name a few). But as I got farther out, they all tapered off. My hair started to shed (I'm cold capping) a few days ago. It's frightening to see. Yesterday, my side burns basically came off. Wondering if it's from wearing my sun glasses. I will continue to cold cap and baby my hair and praying for good results. I had chemo back in 1999 and lost all my hair. I still think that if I can preserve something it will be easier to grow it back when I'm done with treatments. I'm a planner so I've already loaded up on Toppik and L\"oreal Root Cover up. Wondering if I should have a back up plan. Last time I wore a wig but it was Fall/Winter. If my hair gets so bad, I'm thinking I will be a \"scarf person\" this time around. Would wearing a scarf defeat all the hard work I've put into cold capping already?",

Never vomited and didn't feel nauseous. There are lots of meds to prevent that. Be sure to communicate with your doctor and let them know how you feel, they can change your meds if necessary. Easier said than done but try not to worry about it. Mind over matter . find your happy place! You can do this!",
