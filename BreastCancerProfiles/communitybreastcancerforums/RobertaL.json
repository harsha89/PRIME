I was supposed to have my surgery on October 21st, but my surgeon canceled it because I have a condition that causes nerve tumors to come on my skin and if I was to receive radiation, there is a high possibly that they could cancerous. I met with the Radiation Oncologist to discuss this issues and she told me she would never due radiation on my unless I had a lift threatening condition. I finally was able to have my surgery three weeks ago, a lumpectomy per surgeon's recommendation. I saw my Oncologist yesterday and she told me I had an 8% chance of reoccurrence with chemo and HRT, a 10% with just HRT, or 20% with doing nothing. I have decided not to do the chemo because it scares me too much. I decided I didn't want to do the OncoType test because I was told that if it came back where it indicated that chemo would help, I would have to do it. There is only a 2% difference and it's not worth it to me. I hope I have made the right decision with not being able to do radiation.",
