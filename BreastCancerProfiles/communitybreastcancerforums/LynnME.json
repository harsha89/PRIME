I am thankful for not getting chemo curls.  I gave up the wig and hats almost 2 months ago about two weeks after I went back to work.  Almost everyone at work loved the short look and compliment on how fast it is growing.  I work with older patients and I had to laugh when a few thought I was daring or had changed my sexual preference!!!  My hair pre BC was half way down my back, and now I think I will keep it short.  Helps when I am running late in the morning and don't have to do much to it.  Seeing the positive of this..",

I will wait another year before considering right mastectomy, bs thinks risks of surgery outweigh having it removed. Waiting 2 years will be better. Pain is from right thoracotomy. Such a relief, sending positive thoughts to everyone else as you approach your one year mark.",
