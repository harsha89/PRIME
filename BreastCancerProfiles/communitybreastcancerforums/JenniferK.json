Kellerka thanks for the offer, oh, and I'm not so young - 42 - but the kids are ;-) NanaA thanks for all the info, I hadn't had a chance to look into it much, but that does definitely sound like a good thing.  Hope your treatments continue to go smoothly!",

Oh, and the hair is still holding in there :-) Jen",

I had a mamogram in September 2006 after finding a lump and I was told there was no thing to worry about.  Now I have a second lump and am told that they are both cancerous.  I have also been told that if it's cancer now, it was cancer then. The only thing that makes me feel any better about that is that had it been found in 2006 we wouldn't have had our beautiful daughter Jordan.",
