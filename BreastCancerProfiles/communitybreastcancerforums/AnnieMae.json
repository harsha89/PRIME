What can I get done before treatment starts in case it makes me too fatigued to catch up? Who will do those \"must do\" things if I can't? What will my daughter say? Shouldn't I rethink my diet - but I don't eat too badly. Except I need easy-to-eat just in case. Are there local support groups? (There are, but the next meeting is a month away.) Should I tell folks at Church since I might not be able to keep up with everything I normally do? But I don't want folks just talking about me or feeling sorry for me. But it would be nice to have a friend to hang out with I could tell this to. Except I kind of just don't want to talk about it. LOL back and forth.  I'm calming down though. Reading a bit more, and it's not that terrible of a diagnosis. Maybe a blessing in disguise, since I probably would have missed to DCIS entirely if not for this. Just the word \"cancer\" applied to myself is like one of those things you're always so afraid of, then if it happens ... I guess you have to buckle down and shift your frame of reference.  I did happen to notice how blue the sky is today though, and how nice the breeze felt. I just can't bear the thought of risking the loss of loved ones I just recently \"got back\" again. Long story. But that's the part I can't face yet, and it tends to be in process of years, so this \"not so bad\" diagnosis at this point isn't comforting on that level.  I'll work through it all though. Thank you for understanding.",

I don't know if there's some local support group or something. Maybe something like that.  Funny, I've been through a lot of ups and downs today. After seeing the doctor, they got me in at the health clinic to talk about applying for treatment. At least up to now, things happen quickly. Which is good - if it hasn't spread then I'm thinking the sooner I get treatment the better. Also I'm off work for the summer (teacher) so the sooner I get in treatment, hopefully the sooner I can finish and go back to work. It's difficult having the summer without pay as it is. (I'm \"part time\" - really I work full time usually but only get paid for the hours I'm there.)  Sorry, rambling. I guess there's a lot coming into my mind. I'll look for that thread. Thank you!",

I have probably two or three weeks before I might begin treatment, maybe a little longer. I need to quickly figure out things to eat. I am not familiar with a few of those things you mentioned. I usually have yogurt with cereal often though, and I like tuna, will look into canned chicken, and have a big crock pot. I'm kind of worried about household chores, because I'm badly behind now, since I've been sick for a few weeks. I'm off work now for the summer (I'm a teacher) so hopefully little by little I'll get it done before treatment starts. I should have told them at Church. Quite a few asked because I've been out sick for two weeks. It feels awkward, but in guess I'll figure out how to tell them. Strange, it's easier to type it rather anonymously online, but hard to tell people who love you face to face. So far I've only told my husband. (And my pastor.) Thanks for those resources. I've never heard of them. I will check into them in case I need it and they are available. I'm not really living in a convenient place - I don't think there's any delivery (though Wal Mart just started online ordering and curbside pickup). And I'm probably 40 minutes or more drive from most people I go to Church with. But - will see.  Thank you so much. A lot to think about. I wish I had a DVR, but I do have Netflix. :) Things I never would have thought about. Thank you again!",

I usually just use naproxen sodium or Tylenol or aspirin if I need it badly, but really over the years the most serious thing I've had is dental surgery. I haven't ever had \"real surgery\" and I guess I was imagining it would be horrible. There is no expectation right now that they will do a total mastectomy, though I guess I have to keep my mind a bit accepting just in case. I've already been to the doctor being sure it wasn't cancer, and it was, and going in later being sure I wouldn't need surgery, and I have to have it. That ping-pong back and forth makes it a little harder to accept, so I think I'm going to not have such strong expectations from now on if I can help it.  I'll look for some ice packs I guess. And make sure I'm not close to running out of naproxen sodium, etc. Having things to do is good. It makes me feel just a bit more in control.  But I'm very glad to know how to be prepared, and what to expect. I'm very glad to think I might be fine without painkillers. The last time I had them was 20+ years ago, and they had to give me more medications to stop the vomiting. I know codeine and morphine types are out for me.  Thanks SO much! :)",

If nothing else, the surgeon knows he had to use several times the regular amount of novocaine to get it numb enough to do the biopsy. I'm just hoping to get it scheduled soon then. And I'm REALLY glad to hear it can be so uncomplicated. Yes, dental surgery can be bad, lol. I had some done last fall that they normally put people to sleep for, but I declined because I was worried about the anesthesia. I had no idea the surgery would be that rough. It was a horrible experience. But I managed that with nothing more than a few OTC analgesics. This sounds like it just might be a piece of cake in comparison. ;) Thanks again - VERY much. It's so helpful, since I really have no idea what to expect.",

I'll definitely tell him about the nausea. It was horrible with codeine after dental surgery, but it's been bad with others as well. I like the idea of being able to immediately do something about it. Whatever they gave me the last time though knocked me out and then required a catheter for a couple of days. The nurse said, \"I bet they didn't tell you it would cause this!\" and no, they didn't. I need to just stay healthy, lol. I don't like drugs.  Thanks again. :)",

If nothing else because I had what seemed exactly the same before, but it eventually went away. Maybe this started out as the same and turned into cancer. Or maybe there's no connection at all. That doesn't really matter though, does it? I guess the bad news is that I have Padget's. The good news is that there doesn't appear to be an associated deeper tumor, and so far they haven't found any indication of spreading in mammograms or ultrasounds. My doctor (who seems very good, I've only met him twice) seems to want to act quickly but conservatively. He's a surgeon, but wants to try radiation if possible instead of surgery. He wants an MRI and a consult with an oncologist before deciding. The program I was admitted to is only for diagnostics (that's not exactly the impression I got) but they said they are trying to get Medicare for the treatment phase. I don't have insurance, but I had care through a group, but the resources there are limited. I can't decide how to feel. I was pretty calm in waiting, but now I know. And I guess I'm a little in shock. A little scared. But I want to have faith that everything will be ok. I kind of wish I had a friend to talk to in this, but I don't really have anyone locally, and I'm more concerned about my long-distance best friend, or my daughter, more worried for their sakes how they might take the news. And I don't think I'm in a position just yet to be strong for someone else. Anyway. I guess that's it. That's all I know right now. Thanks for reading. Log in to post a reply",

They are recommending just a small surgery since it's hopefully just Paget's on the nipple and DCIS. Then radiation after. It could still be much worse of course. I'm just not happy about being out for an extra month (though I'll get over that), but the anesthesia scares me (my body reacts weirdly to drugs). I am also concerned I might not be able to take any painkillers afterward, since they usually don't help pain, but they do cause continual vomiting. I literally thought I was dying the last time I took pain killers. Well. Hopefully I will assimilate this new news soon. :)",

They told me last week there would be a $400+ copay for my MRI tomorrow, and I asked them at the MRI place to check on that. I'd been told it would be fully covered and I can't work during summer, so ... They were supposed to verify it was fully covered. They called today to remind me of appt, and still hadn't checked, so they cancelled my appt because they needed a new authorization (which arrived in my mailbox today, but I guess they didn't get it in time. So now I have to reschedule MRI. Haven't heard back from surgeon about appt. Everything moved lightning-fast the first few weeks, now it seems like nothing is happening. But I guess I'll get it figured out. :)  The seatbelt is already bothering me since I have Paget's. Actually, it's healing up a bit, but that never lasts. Maybe it's in my mind, or maybe it was due to all the injections and biopsy, but it seems so much more inflamed and tender since I gift the biopsy. It's making me almost look forward to surgery, I guess. Almost. :)  Thanks everyone, so much. It's very helpful to hear your experiences, and be reassured, and know of thngs that will work. I have one gel freezer pack but it's the hard kind. Maybe I'll just go with peas. I used to use them a few times for my daughter when she was little.  Thanks again!",
