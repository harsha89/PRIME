It was convenient when he was searching through my things he found out about the life insurance policy.  The love of money can make people evil.  None of that matters.  I am divorced from him but not my daughter.  I have a will and a trust set up for her to protect her assets but she will, in turn he will, get my social security payments.  It is unfair but that's our legal system.  Lately he has been better about visitation with her and being more involved in her life.  I am fighting to be around for a long time so that she can stand on her own two feet and I am equipping her with everything I got and then some :-)",
