Lories- Her techs were just terse and a bit mean to her today.  I found out later that the real reason she was upset is that they didn't tell her that every Monday they have to take new pictures and that she is on the table with the machine all up in her business for much longer than usual.  She is more than a little clausterphobic (sp?) and would have done way better if someone had prepared her beforehand.  Why don't they think to tell the patient?  Anyway, she said that they would have had to be exceedingly kind to have made her calmer and so a little mean didn't really matter all that much.  I just hate it when she's upset, though.  One thing that did make me nervous is that she said it sounded like today they ran the machine much more often than before.  Now it could have just been the pictures.  She sees a (substitute) radiation onc tomorrow (hers is out for the week) and hopefully she/ we can ask about that.  Anyone else have this experience?  Paranoid here too.  As usual it is so good to hear from everyone.

Do any of you know if high blood pressure is a SE of rads?  My mother had a bit of a problem with that today and they told her to talk to her cardiologist but I think she should mention it to the rad onc that she see's tomorrow (not her's but that's a different story).  She also was really tired for the first time today (# 11 of 33). Cathie.  My mom said that the simulation was much worse than the actual treatments because it takes so long to get things figured out but it gets better. Cupcake. Continue to be the squeaky wheel.  It is the only way.  My mom had some complications after surgery and no one wanted to take any responsibility until I was breathing down their necks.  Speak up for yourself (I was also just told this by a higher up in the ACS.  She also said to read How Doctors Think which is appently on this very topic .)",

I am in agreement with lexislove.  The Rad Onc usually likes to have you start radiation at the maximum 8 weeks out of chemo or surgery however rads on flesh that is open/ not healed can be a big issue.  My mother had complications with her surgery (late Dec 07) and had a 6cm hole/ open wound develop in her breast. Because of the hole she could not do radation so they went ahead with chemo in Mar 08.  She went through chemo with the hole and because chemo is about breaking your cells down the hole didn't heal until January (when she developed a fungal infection at the wound site).  She had a mammo on Oct 08 on the breast with the open wound and the radiation destroyed much of the new growth and made the hole regress from 1 cm  back to 3 cm. I would caution you to talk seriously with your rad onc about radiating a breast that has not healed from surgery complications because of this. She did not have her rads begin until Feb 09 (only 4 left to go Yippie!) Her team (medical onc, rad onc, surgeon) all conferred and agreed on the time line for her and her specific issues.  We did have to push them to get them to talk and discuss her case together but once they did we felt that it was the best course of action.  One of the compromises that they made was that she did begin her AI right after chemo so something was protecting her while she was waiting for the rads.   Talk to your doctors and try to get them to talk to each other about your specific set of circumstances.
