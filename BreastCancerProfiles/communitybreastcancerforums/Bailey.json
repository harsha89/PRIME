I have not tried it but saw where it can be ordered to use during radiation since you can't shave or wear deoderant...I am using the natural cornstarch and it is w'ing amazingly well! I am shocked!    Bev",

No nodes removed...Rad./Oncol. said it may be strain from the surgery positions I was in and now being in the position with arms over head every day...He offered to write me a script for a muscle relaxer and did but I have not taken it yet.
