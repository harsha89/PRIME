Prior to surgery the BS had classed my IDC as Stage 2 based on the estimated size of the tumor. However, after surgery it was downgraded to Stage 1 because the tumor was actually smaller than estimated. So far everything is going well. The incisions are healing well and the only (slight) discomfort I have is at the SNB site. I'm awating results of the Oncotype DX test to see if I'll need chemo...keeping my fingers crossed on that one! Hope everyone here is doing well and stays that way! I know I can count on the sistahs here if I have any questions.",

What has struck me is all the newbies!!! What's with this effing disease, anyway?! So many women's lives are suddenly turned upside down, so many families are in shock. I always took my good (actually, \"great\"!) health for granted. Now every little twinge, ache or pain startles me, makes me wonder if this is something I should be looking into. What a way to live....NOT! I can't really complain, with my relatively \"good\" stats. My MO said my statistical recurrence rate is 6%. But it's still something that I'll (WE will) always have to live with...to watch out for...to worry about. IT SUCKS!!! Don't get me wrong....I really have a good and positive attitude, considering. But it still sucks!",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2012 07:42AM - edited Feb 16, 2012 06:33PM by Snoopsmom Welcome, Stemanita. Don't feel guilty that your diagnosis doesn't seem as \"serious\" as others'! It's still a CANCER diagnosis and you have the right to be scared and worried! I have pretty much the same stats as you do, and I'm grateful that my numbers turned out the way they did. I have several friends and acquaintances who are sisters in this club...some with situations similar to mine, some much more serious. And they are ALL happy for me and in no way try to make me feel guilty. I think you'll find the same thing....we are all in this together and are ready to help and support our sisters no matter how \"serious\" or \"easy\" our diagnosis may be....it's still CANCER! Regarding your treatment, just get all the facts you can about your chances of recurrence with or without certain treatments, then do what your heart/brain tells you. It's YOUR body, and your decision. I don't know how old you are, but with myself (age 65, widow, no kids) I'm going to try to avoid chemo at all costs. I do know that I'll be going on Tamoxifen once I'm done with radiology, but I don't have my oncotype score yet so I don't know if chemo is on the agenda yet.....I hope not. If I were younger and had a family, my choice may be different.",

I just found out my Oncotype score...it's 9 (YAY!), so hopefully my MO will forego chemo and send me directly on to radiation. I'll meet with him on the 28th. I had my lumpectomy on January 19th and I was fortunate enough to have breezed through that with no problems. I'm set to travel to Australia in September so chemo would have made that very doubtful. I just want to thank all of you veterans who have been so helpful to newbies like myself. There's no way I would have been able to travel this road as smoothly as it has been without all the great advice and support found here. I have great support here at home, and several friends who have traveled this road as well, but all the wonderful resources I've found here have been a Godsend. Thanks again, everyone! Susan",

I went home to my sister's house overnight (she insisted on it!) but I certainly could have gone to my house although I live alone. I didn't have any real pain, mostly discomfort. I was given a prescription for pain meds but all I took was Extra Strength Tylenol on the first night. The worst discomfort came with stretching on that side, like reaching too far for something. You might have a problem with heavy lifting for a while because you might tear out your stitches or whatever method they use to close the incision. I would certainly tell your surgeon about your job requirements. Other than that,you shouldn't have too much of a problem if it is a \"routine\" lumpectomy. Good luck with your surgery, and come back and tell us how you are doing.",
