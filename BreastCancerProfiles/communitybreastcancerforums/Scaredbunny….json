I had a BMX with 7 lymph nodes affected and tumor was 5.6cm. I had surgery first then I dI'd 4 AC 2 Taxol and 2 more to go. Then on to radiation. My BC is IMPC. You are 6 years out at this stage. That sounds amazing to me. My oncologist has said that I am at high risk of reoccurrence. ..was this said to you by your team at the time ?",

I had a BMX grade 3 tumor. 5.6 cm in length micropapillary with 7 lymph nodes affected with cancer. I believe that I am at high risk of reoccurrence which is frightening.
