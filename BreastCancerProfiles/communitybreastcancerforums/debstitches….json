She's going to skip today's visit and will try to drain some more tomorrow.  I was happy that I don't continually wear the bag.  The drainage with the bag is much more comfortable than the vacume bottles.  The pain is subsiding and Tylenol does manage to dull most of it.  I'm off to chemo this morning....I should be really out of it this afternoon.  Jackie, I hope you made out ok last Thursday.  I'll PM you later.

Because of the intensive radiation to the breast/chest area in 2000, this radiation treatment needed to be modified to not overlap with the previous area.  I have been told that some areas can be re-radiated but it depends on the amount and style of radiation previously given.  This is a question I always ask before I accept treatment.  I had radiation to my spine last spring & I asked whether or not the area could be re-radiated and my rad onc said yes, if need be.  You are right in checking all of the facts and getting opinions but you need to choose a treatment which will deliver the best QOL without jeapordizing future treatments.  That's the tough line we walk.  Hugs to you from another Canadian Debbie",

When I was faced with my decision, I couldn't find any responses to my question or any other postings about the superclavical nodes.  I only had the left side radiated but the nodes in the right side also disappeared around the same time as the left ones did.  I had minimal side effects, sore throat, pink skin in the radiated area.  I was warned about difficult swallowing but I was able to eat everything.  My oncologist encouraged me to do the radiation because it works faster than the chemo does.  She also would have liked me to had the mediastinal nodes radiated but because of the intense radiation given to the breast area in 2001, the radiation oncologist said that the skin would just break down.  So I would encourage you to speak to the radiation oncologist before making your decision and find out if you radiate the neck, if it can be re-radiated if the lymph nodes return.  It seemed to be important to my oncologist to stop the spread in the neck nodes quickly.  There are some important nerves that travel down your neck that affect your voice, eyes, breathing, heart & digestive system.  I have Horners syndrom now and very little voice.  My ENT doctor says that even with the cancer stopped in the nodes,for now, the healthy nerve tissue does not regenerate and scar tissue remains in it's place.  The radiation worked for me in terms of stopping the progression but since I also have other mets, I continue on my chemo.  The chemo they are suggesting for you will be available if you progress elsewhere but the radiation will stop the one place you have mets now.  Hope this helps.  Sometimes I feel woefully lacking in helping with advice since this journey is relatively new for me too.
