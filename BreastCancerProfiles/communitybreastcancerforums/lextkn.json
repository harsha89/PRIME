I had a terrible sinus cold and needless to say you had to lay flat on your back and not move, cough or even twitch for a certain lenght of time. the time will be based on how many minutes it takes for your heart to beat a certain amount of times(500 0r so  think) for instance my pulse was 76 therefore I had to lay still for 7-8 minutes. I know that here you had to acheive at least a 50 on this test to be considered passing. I was 63 and was told that was very good. Not sure of the top score but am thinking it is only like 70. I know for  a fact it is not 100.",

To see the surgeon on 12/4 and immediately sent to the oncologist who started chemo on 12/29. I will have 6 chemo treatments with halfway through another apointment with the surgeon to schedule my mastectomy when the chemo is finished. I am just confused as to am I the only one who gets chemo before surgery? The surgeon said he felt it would be the best for me or was it because of the holidays and not wanting to take on another pt just yet?",
