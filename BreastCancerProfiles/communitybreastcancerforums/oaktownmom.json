But I'm almost a year out now, and the good news is that the treatment is totally manageable - not fun, but doable. My hair is growing back, I just ran my first-ever 5K, and I feel great. The period right after diagnosis was the most difficult for me, and I think you'll start feeling better once you have a treatment plan in place and are working to get that cancer out of your body once and for all.

At the heart of this for me is a wish that my cancer had been caught earlier. So much of this for me is coming to terms with my diagnosis, rather than caring too much when people ask intrusive questions. I honestly don't think it would have occured to me in my life before bc that asking someone about how early it was caught could be such a painful question for someone still struggling with a new reality. Questions about prognosis and reconstruction and life insurance on the other hand - clearly inappropriate!!!",

Congrats Ellen and Robyn on being done!!! Hope everyone else is having a good SE-free day.",

I had a long protocol (AC x 4, Taxol x 12), so even though I started in August with the rest of you, I am just finishing up. Starting Tamoxifen next week, and rads in February. Hope everyone is doing well - I've so appreciated the wisdom and support of this group! Here's to a healthy new year for us all! Lucy",

My ONC says it's fine for me to get a flu shot, and they're going to give it to me tomorrow when I go in for chemo.  It is so interesting how much variation there is in these things - makes me kind of nervous. Hope everyone's week is off to a good start! Lucy",
