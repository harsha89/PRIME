I'm doing dose dense (every 2 weeks), 4 cycles of AC then 4 cycles of Taxol.  I did my 2nd dose last week, not too bad (thank goodness for all the anti-nausea drugs and my insurance plan!), no hair now, which is weird.  I shaved it off before it started to really fall out, made me feel a little more in control (\"you can't fire me, I quit!\").  I've mostly had fatigue, which is challenging with a toddler but my husband is amazing and we have some family around, so I've learned to let go, let others help take care of me and my son (he's probably the best medicine there is).  Does anyone else have little ones at home?  How is that going?  Anyway, take care, everyone, it's so nice to have such a place to connect. -Ellen",
