We have a strong history of cancer in our family, great grandmother breast cancer at a young age, both grandparents died fairly young of cancer. My daughter herself had an extensive medical history...kidney disorder, hypothyroidism, long extended menstrual cycles, cysts on the ovaries, crazy infections and just recently had her gallbladder removed as it was only functioning at 5%. Most don't experience all this until later in life...Now the lump! Here are my questions...is it possible or has anyone ever heard of a teenager with breast cancer? What are the odds? I have heard that generally breast cancer lumps don't hurt? Is that true? Please help...find information on teens and breast cancer is not an easy task! Log in to post a reply",

So many are stating they are waiting so long for answers and appointments or being told to wait 6 months to be rechecked. My daughters first appointment was last week at the gyno, next day ultrasound 2 days later breast specialist...Wednesday she will have her lump removed. I'm now wondering if my daughters doctors are really concerned and not saying??? Or are we just lucky with medical care??? Why is this moving so fast for her and so many others are waiting for long periods of time? We have only been in panic mode for a week, I can't imagine worrying for 6 months.",

She suggested waiting 3 months before doing anything to see if there are any changes. She stated there was a solid mass but sometimes over time there is a \"softening\". Sometimes there are changes with menstrual cycles. Which in some cases I would say yes but according to my daughter she has had the lump for sometime now...approx 3-4 months. So far there have been no changes. However, this doctor made me feel like having the lump removed was not necessary right and may not be necessary later. All the information we have received is very confusing! We are rescheduled to have the lump removed next week and now I'm not sure what to do. A 3rd opinion???? I guess my next thought is...if I had a lump anywhere on my body that didn't belong, I would probably have it out!",

According to both Dr's the Lump is a solid mass and it is hard to determine what type of mass. They both agree it does not move free...(unsure what that means) They both agree it is not a cyst and it is not a perfect round size...Anyway the first dr. stated the only way to tell exactly what we were dealing with was to take it out.",

Luckily my daughter is very positive (nervous but positive) She told me everything happens for a reason and she has already found her reason. My daughter is a cheerleader, we shared her story with her coach as my daughter will not be able to cheer for a couple of weeks after the lump is removed. Anyway her coach who is 26, was concerned, she also expressed she thought very little about breast exams or breast health. My daughter and her coach decided to take time out of practice to discuss the importance of breast health and self breast exams. It was amazing that not many teens never think about it. They were all shocked and many stated it only happens in older people. Hopefully my daughters experience will help other girls! In the meantime she now has the support of her whole team...they will be there for her to celebrate when the new is all good! Either way her spirits are high! I figure I will do the worrying!!! Let her have fun!",

This was the doctor I originally wanted but they were unavailable for a 6 weeks. I guess it can't hurt to have another opinion. Of course my daughter is not happy about going to another doctor. She said she is tired of being felt up and just wants \"it\" out! I think another opinion may be a good idea.",
