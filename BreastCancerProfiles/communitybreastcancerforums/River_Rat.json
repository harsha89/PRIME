After my BMX I gave away many tighter tops and bought some big baggy tops. I now regret doing that. I ended up giving away the big baggy tops and buying new t-shirts and such very similar to the ones I gave away in the first place. I found that by wearing scarves or vests or jackets I could wear the clothing that suited my style and still feel confident. You may end up liking big and baggy but if you don't you'll regret getting rid of the clothes you have now. So this is just a caution to hang on to those clothes just in case.",

Anyway there are some bras that have those and there's a little slit where they can be removed but you can also stick a little something in there if you want to. I've found with the Genie Bra and the Coobie Bra just the modesty pads themselves take away the concave look. There are also generics of those bras that you can find. If you Google Genie Bra and Coobie Bra you'll get an idea what to look for. Edited to add: I find the Genie to be more comfortable than the Coobie because the Coobie is cut a little higher under the arm, which I found irritating in hot weather. But if you get the Genie Bra size up. I'm a 36 band which I believe their size chart said was a small. I found they had them in the \"as sold on TV\" section of Target so I tried them on and at first bought a large but it seemed to want to roll up. I went back and got an XL and it fit fine.",

I have used toupee tape and \"Hollywood Tape\" to tape foam forms in camisoles without shelf bras and that has worked well.  I don't have any of my old bras to try out with forms because I went from a 36C before surgery to wearing 36A forms, now down to 36AA forms and going flat.  I had to do a gradual transition to go flat and I'm still not comfortable with that in every situation. I've never wanted reconstruction and I now go without forms much of the time.  But I still enjoy playing around trying out options for those times I feel I need forms to feel confident.  Your site was very helpful to me when my breast surgeon and a few of my friends couldn't understand that reconstruction just wasn't for me.",

Barbara (Starak), you were wondering about those who sometimes wears the girls and sometimes doesn't - well I'm one of those people.  I don't usually wear forms but once in a while if I want to wear something that I just can't wear without them then I just wear the darned things.  This doesn't happen very often.  Before surgery I was a 34D but when I bought my first forms I went with a B.  I wore those for a year or so - didn't even think of the possibility of not wearing any back then.  About a year later I went with forms that equaled out to an A.  Another year later and I was down to a AA and quit wearing them most of the time.  So when I wear forms it's just pretty much to fill in the concavity and not to look at all busty.  I also sewed pockets into my swimsuits and put just enough shower scrunchy in there to acheive the same thing.  For me transitioning to nothing has been a gradual process.  The truth is if I were flatter - I've got the little dog ears in the center and fullness along the bottom - I would never, ever wear the forms.  I don't want to have surgery to remove those areas though because I have pleasant breast sensations there and I'd like to hang on to that.   ",
