I hope that there is a cancer resource center at or near where you'll be doing rads so that you can find some support and meet others going through this. I've found two support groups through the hospital that have been really helpful. I would hope that if other BC survivors know of your predicament being there by yourself they'll find ways to provide support. If you have a religious affiliation, you might also find local support through those channels. In any event, keep in touch with this forum so that we know how you're doing and can provide more support.",

There was some even after the 2nd chemo, but it was always white or gray. In the past week, there's now some that's dark. Since I've colored my hair for I don't remember how many years, the dark hair is a surprise. I expect to keep waering my wig for quite awhile--I really like the style and color and don't find it too uncomfortable. I want to ask my stylist if she can make my own hair look like the wig! I was surpirsed today to discover that I actually have some hair on my lower legs--somehow I'd missed it! I guess I was expecting it to come in stubbly, but since I normally use an epilator on my lower legs, these hairs are thin and not really dark.  So I put the epilator to work. Also discovered armpit hair so use the electric shaver attachment on that. I seem to still have most of my lashes, but the one brow that wasn't thin already has become more sparse--of course, the white hairs that are out of line are still growing!",

Yesterday my onc told me that if she didn't believe I would get appropriate treatment here she wouldn't hesitate to send me elsewhere.    Sharonw - I'd been wondering where you were! Sounds like you've been doing lots of research. I'm not sure I understand how it works when you're on your stomach--is the radiation done from below? Given your early stage diagnosis, you've been hitting all the treatments. That's great that you can do it in 3 weeks, too. Let us know how it goes at NYU. I'm now set for my simulation at Arlington on May 13, about 3 weeks after my last TC chemo.",

I wanted to wear my wig, but it wasn't comfortable with my hair underneath, so on Sunday, day 18, I went to a Hair Cuttery to get it cut short, but the stylist didn't understand me and made it too \"nice.\" My DH went back with me and had another stylist buzz it to an inch long all over. As more falls out I'll just have my DH buzz it at home. I'm surprised how used to having such short hair I've gotten around the house, so don't always wear a scarf. Yesterday I wore the wig to work (10 hours total), and it was pretty comfortable. People's reactions are interesting. Even those who know about the b/c may not know that it's a wig. For others, I  just say I was ready for a change (I actually like the style better than my real hair so have to show it to my regular stylist!). The one thing that bothers me is that the top of my head is really sensitive and hurts a lot when touched. Anyone else experience that? It doesn't itch or ache otherwise. Do others have a hard time spelling words in their messages? I really try to re-read what I've written! ",

What I don't like is all the short hairs sticking to clothes and the inside of the wig, so I'm using packing tape to clean that and to rub over my head. Had 2nd tx this afternoon and was able to walk home again (about 3 blocks). However, I didn't sleep well last night because of the 2 steroids I took.
