Mine started partially growing back during Taxol, it was super fine and white. At the four week mark I was still wondering if I was going to get any of my dark hair back and when it was going to fill in. Finally, after week five it started filling in and coming in black. It was slow going and I still had lots of bald spots. I am 12 weeks PFC and it has filled in all over the place head, legs, arms, face, etc. I am hoping that in another 4 weeks about the time I finish Rads that I'll feel comfortable without the wig at least for casual outings. I normally have short hair but it is too short now and doesn't balance my face out. I have my fingers crossed because pretty soon I it will be too hot for the wig. Good Luck all. MJ",

Tuesday meeting with the PA to get details of the process. Friday having CT and Echocardiogram, and next Monday will get a port.  I'll have dense dose adriamycin and cytoxan for 4 cycles then 12 weeks of taxol.  I felt confident with my teams advice but am reassured to see from other posts that this seems to be the standard for my dx.  I'm working on my to do and to bring list and appreciate all the suggestions, already ordered tea oil.  I plan to go wig shopping next week and get a few hats and scarfs.  I hope everyone's treatments go smoothly.",

Sending positive thoughts,",

I have some neuropathy in my hands and feet mostly a loss of sensation. The PA did a touch test and said it was milder than she expected and anticipates improvement in 3 to 6 months. She thought it would go away all together with some time. I hope she is right, it isn't painful but annoying. Surgery next month and then on to rads. One step at a time.",

I did use ice chips during adriamycin and not yet having mouth problems but am using the baking soda rinse and switched to a milder touthpaste. For water, I am making my own fusion with organic lemons and a little bit of ginger and am using electrolyte water like smart water.  It helps with taste and the lemons and ginger are good for the tummy. I also took someones advice on here and am keeping some saltines to have at night. I have no idea what really works and what doesn't but I'll keep at this until it doesn't seem to work. Hair still good.  My wig should be in soon, then I'll decide when to shave, I think I'll have a private event that's just me.  Probably the day before my 2nd treatment.  Glad it's winter it will be easier to wear a wig and hats.   Kerensa hope the new treatment works better. Thinking of everyone else on this unplanned detour in life.",

I had neulasta today, in the past I have not had significant bone pain, nothing that ibuprofen doesn't handle. My blood counts have been good, so it must be working. I looked at my insurance bill and can't believe how expensive this one shot is. ilovecoasters, I'm the other person that the Emla cream doesn't seem to do too much for but I am afraid not to use in case it would be worse. Maybe we have thick skin because they keep telling me it shouldn't hurt but it is only for a short time. i don't have any other pain with the port but I can feel it sometimes when i try to get comfortable to sleep. Stay strong everyone, we can do this, well actually we don't have a whole lot of choice, so we must get through this. Best, MJ",

I am on the same chemo regimen and mine told me to avoid crowds not all public places i.e. don't go to a large concert where there are a lot of folks coughing and sneezing that you can't avoid. She said I could go shopping etc. I am doing things like shopping Monday thru Friday when it is not so busy. I also use anti-bacterial hand wash and hand wipes a lot more than I used. I do stay home a lot as I am not working but I would go crazy too if I couldn't do anything for five months. Good Luck, ",

As to insurance, don't give up on that it was not your mistake. All the Drs. I have been to have been really focused on the insurance, so this is their mistake and they or hospital should take ownership. Also, the hospital should have a social worker that should be able to help you. When my mother had ovarian and didn't have insurance or medicare at all, the social worker helped us get bills reduced especially from the hospital. All her doctors reduced their bills significantly with the exception of the anestesiologist. They all set up payment plans though. As they say, Keep on Keeping. I had my first Taxol today. Thank God, I was not allergic, I was very anxious about that. I am taking some of the anti-nausea meds although none are required only as needed. I just don't want to need them and have to catch up. I am going to take an ativan to help me sleep tonight as i took a boat load of Decadron, yesterday and today. All the best, Mary-Jo ",

Your employer can't discriminate against you because of your illness. This includes firing as well as not selecting you for available jobs for which you are qualified. I would check on who the EEO counselor is for the district and find out how to file a grievance/complaint. If they don't have that type of system then go to www.ada.gov and there are directions on filing a complaint. Often just raising the issue with the appropriate persons changes attitudes. Employers do not want to go through an EEO investigation. I know this is hard particularly when you are facing cancer. There are also health insurance options through COBRA or \"Obamacare\". Hope this might help.",
