Went to have a mammogram done on the 7th and they \"found nothing but I have dense tissue\" so I left confused and no answers. Before this I was just talking with my Ob. Who said I may be just hormones but labs came back normal. Finally went to a surgeon who said there was in fact blood coming from my duct and that she wanted to do a duct excision to have it tested. ( on the 27th) waiting on test results which we were told we would have at the follow up appointment on the 5th. Waiting is horrible right now. I feel like she wouldn't have done the surgery if there wasn't a decent chance of it being positive right? This is all so new and was never really discussed growing up or even in too many health classes on what to expect. Any help or insight would be great. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
