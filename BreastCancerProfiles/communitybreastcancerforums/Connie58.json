The current treatment plan is one month of a combination of Adriamycin and Cytoxin. That will be followed by four months of Taxol. Then followed by radiation therapy. I never dreamed my biopsy would be positive and feel guilty as hell putting this on my husband's shoulders. When should I shave my head, I do not want to watch it fall out again. Looking forward to meeting you all. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Stage 2a, Grade 3 Triple Negative, 2 node including SN removed both negative, biopsy 2/2/16, results given next day, lumpectomy and node removal 2/4/16.
