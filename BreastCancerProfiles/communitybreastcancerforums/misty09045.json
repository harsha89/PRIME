I was diagnosed orignially as just having calcifications in stage1 but when the surgery came around, and we got the pathology results back, things had changed alot. With 3 kids, and being physically limited as to what all I could do because of both the surgery and chemo, I wondered how I was going to keep up on the house. My husband's aunt and uncle found something for me. It's a website I feel everyone undergoing chemo needs to check out! www.cleaningforasreason.org Many companies have joined this worthy cause, but many more are needed. It is for housecleaning companies to donate their time to come clean once a month for patients undergoing chemo. The site is a great way to find out if there's anyone in your area that is actively participating in this program! I encourage everyone to check it out, and if there is anyone in your area already participating use this wonderful resource,and if they aren't participatingÂ talk to the companies, and see if they will participate.

My next round is Feb. 16.. I haven't caught up on all the posts yet, but, I think I'm very glad to have other people to talk to that are around the same treatment time. Everyone in my oncology clinic has either gone through chemo before, or have been on for months/weeks already! Is anyone experiencing anything with their hair yet? I have noticed more strands coming out than before, but I think the worst part is the tingling right now. It's almost like a burning. Is anyone else going through that? Is there anything to lesson the tingling sensation? So many questions in my head today! LOL Stephanie~~ together we can beat this",
