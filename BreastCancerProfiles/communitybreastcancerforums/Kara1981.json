My biopsy is scheduled for Thursday. I go from being confident everything will be ok to the exact opposite! It\u2019s quite the rollercoaster.",

Had Ultra Sound today and the radiologist said she thought it was a fibroadenoma but ordered a core needle biopsy to be sure. I am 37 and a Mom to a 4 year old and a 9 month old- I\u2019m also still breast feeding. I looked at the US report and saw a braid 4a category. I guess I\u2019m wondering about others who have had a similar experience...I am terrified of the biopsy. Any ideas on how it will effect breast feeding? I was told to pump that day because of the lidocaine.",
