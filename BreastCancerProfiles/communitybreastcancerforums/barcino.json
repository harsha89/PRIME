      "Content": "barcino wrote: Hi Ladies,  First of all my love and support to all of you who are going through cancer or who are worried about it.   I am a 34 year old healthy mother of two.  I have recently lost 50 lbs over the course of 2 years - I have also been breastfeeding two children over the last 7 years.  The last one weaned 5-6 mo ago.  My breasts have gone from huge 36F size to a smaller 34D and I think I might be smaller now and I have lost fat and inches everywhere pretty dramatically.  Lots of inches lost in the chest.   I have noticed a lot of stretchmarks, and loose creppey skin in my breasts and obviously thought nothing about it.  Recently I did a breast exam (which I am awful at keeping up with - not anymore!) and noticed that when I raise my arms there is dimpling/cellulite/ugly skin on the side and under side of both breasts - more pronounced on the right breast.  I am thinking that this is probably related to the weight loss but I am not taking it lightly.  I have my well woman in two weeks so I will point it out to my OBGYN. Is dimpling ALWAYS a sign of bc?  Mine is not one deep dimple - and it is for sure NOT that small dimple orange peel look.  It is like superficial dimples almost ripples and some lines (the lines I think are actually strechmarks) I dont have any other symptoms other than tenderness (but I am about to start my period) and I do still seem to be able to squeeze what I assume is milk from my breasts (both) but I know that can be normal after extended breastfeeding and I nursed for 2.5 years this last one.  I cannot feel any lumps.  Just feels like a lot of fibers in there but I cannot find any lumps. I would love your advice - is my OBGYN the place to start or should I schedule something with a breast specialist or both.   Blessings to all of you and thanks in advance!   I want to walk the line between being smart and proactive and not going over to the freakout zone too quickly because I tend to be really good at that.  If anything this will teach me to take my self examinations very seriously from now on.   Log in to post a reply",

And I will update when I see the OB so if someone else goes wondering the same they can read it.",
