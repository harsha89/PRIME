At first I thought it was an allergic reaction to something I had touched, but on Monday my MO said it looked like shingles. I had shingles before, but not on my hand. It is not really painful but very, very inconvenient -- I had to postponed Heceptin until Monday and next week I am scheduled for the exchange. Can I still go ahead with it? I will have to call my PS. Worse yet, since it is not painful,  I don't really know  when exactly it all started, and since the rash/blisters are in a very exposed, but not immediately visible place, how many people could I have infected, including my baby grandson?  I am so angry that I did not get shingles vaccine before my chemo, never knew it existed.  Or well, now that I got it all out of my system, I am feeling better.",

Neither one seemed overly concerned about the possibility that i may be infectious.",

At least I would know if the chemo worked. The MRI and Pet scans performed after core biopsy showed 2cm tumor and not the actual 4+cm, so the surgeon decided on immediate  surgery. Interesting thing is that when I contacted oncologist's office at SKCC for consultation, they told me that they set up  appointments only  AFTER breast surgery and not before, without even knowing the size of the tumor.",
