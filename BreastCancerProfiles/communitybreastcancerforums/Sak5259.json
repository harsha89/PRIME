Doc sent me for mammogram and targeted ultrasound (first mammo as I'm only 36). Radiologist thinks it's a fibroadenoma, re check for stability in 6 months. Mamo report says \"heterogeneously dense breast\", \"2 cm nodular density with indistinct margin\". Ultrasound says \"2cm oval mass of mixed echogenicity with defined boundry\". I don't know what I'm reading but think, \"it's a fibroid no big deal\". Well last week I do my monthly check and feel another lump, couple inches from original, but this one feels differently, oblong vertical definitely a lump. I toyed with the idea of waiting the 3 months that I still have to go for recheck but called my Gyno for advice. She feels the new lump and is sending me to a breast specialist. My question is, if they tell me it's another fibroid, and if offered, should I go ahead and have a biopsy? Or, wait and see if there are changes in the next 3 months? I've never had breast issues other than a complex fibroid removed at 21. Can fibroadenomas come up so quickly? Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
