I took the suggestion of a colleague and have been seeing an acupuncturist who specializes in treating chemo side effects. I think this is making a big difference. He also has me on two different types of Chinese herbal supplements (my oncologist knows about this). WBC was high before treatment 2, so avoided the nasty Neulasta shot. Hoping for the same this week. I have kept up a full work schedule so far, only taking off the day of infusion. Am also back to running (albeit slowly and not very far). I still feel like I am in someone else's body, but the acupuncture/exercise/normal schedule routine seems to be getting me through this. Also know that all the prayer support is making a difference, as is the support of my husband. The end is in sight. WIth an oncotype score of 31, there really was no choice about the chemo. Sure hope it's doing its job!  ",

      "Content": "Jul 25, 2017 02:55AM - edited Jul 25, 2017 02:55AM by Tassie I lost most of my hair around infusion #2. Since then it's slowed down considerably. I have a bit of fuzz on my head. Eyebrows are thin, have lost some eyelashes and also hair loss on the rest of my body. Wear a fedora out in the sun, but it's been too hot in KS to wear the neat hats my friends have made for me. Infusion #4 is July 28, will find out from MO about when radiation starts and if I go back on Arimidex. I've already had the radiation mapping so should be ready to go with that. And ready to get all this behind me, as I'm sure all of you are!",

Claritin helped considerably, the nurse said \"you might as well take Claritin everyday while in chemo.\" Yesterday was the pits, many trips to the bathroom and significant stomach pain. Today is a good day. I tell people that I was in my own body when I went for the infusion, but I came out with someone else's body. Hoping to get back to short runs these next two weeks. Glad to be traveling with you on this journey, hang in there.",

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2017 01:22AM - edited Jul 8, 2017 01:24AM by Tassie Hi-- My cancer was a seconday primary in the opposite breast, so not a recurrence. The oncologist called the 6mm tumor small but aggressive, and so ordered the onctotype test. He said \"you could choose no chemo, but the likelihood of recurrence is high and if it does come back, it will show up in another part of your body and you will have about three years.\" So really no choice! For yesterday's infusion, my white count was high again so no neulasta shot. Am definitely a convert to acupuncture and chinese herbs. Prayers are with all of you.",

Felt good to ring the big bell as I walked out the door, and everyone in the waiting room applauded...and that made my husband tear up. Everyone in that room is on the journey and knows the bell is a milestone. So now a week of yuck, and then on to recovery. Radiation, port removal, and Arimidex again. My prayers go out to each of you, with hopes for a successful end to this cancer journey for all of us.    ",
