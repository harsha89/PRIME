I dont understand what people mean when they say \"mets\" can anyone explain that to me? are you referencing tumors removed from the breasts?  I still dont fully undestand why I am stage 4 and metastatic.  I feel like I must be missing some information the Dr gave me already to understand.  I don't think I have been taking this as seriously as I should be, it seems very real and very removed at the same time.   I am trying to figure out what to expect from now on but as I have been searching around I dont see any stage iv metastatic triple negative BC threads.  I dont even know what info I am looking for, it is like being thrown in the deep end of the pool and not knowing how to swim.  Any help, insight or direction to the right area would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Fatigue, neuropathy, hand/foot syndrome, a rash on my chest/neck, feeling like i am beaten all over, sleep issues. I feel week all the time and Thrush.  I was in the hospital once for neutropenia. Oh and everything tastes like crap but I'm not too hungry so that helps.  I do enjoy not having to shave very often!",

And let me just apologize for my terrible typing in advance, my hands dont quite work they way they used to, I try to fix mistakes but dont always see them. ",
