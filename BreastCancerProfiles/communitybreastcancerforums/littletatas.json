Lefty is a small C cup but the right one (loser one) is a small B so maybe it is small enough for no drain. I'm okay with having the drain as I know it serves a good purpose but have not seen anyone on the forums without drains. Surgery in 6 days... have never been in the hospital so I'm nervous. They said Home Health care workers will be coming to my house to check the drain (if necessary), giving me sponge baths, etc. I told my friend I hope I get a Channing Tatum look-a-like!! ha ha But honestly I was just diagnosed less than a month ago so everything is a little surreal right now. My husband has been a rock for me. He says he doesn't care if I have boobs or not, just that he has me around for a long time. That's my plan!!",

      "Content": "Sep 10, 2015 04:20AM - edited Sep 10, 2015 04:33AM by littletatas Starting DD Taxol # 3 of 4 tomorrow. My experience with Taxol #1 was awful. Severe bone pain on Days 4-7 and Dr had to double my pain meds. I couldn't walk! I had to use a wheelchair. The pain in my knees and hips was excrutiating to the point I called MO and asked to stop chemo altogether, this is the first time I considered stopping. My main complaint on A/C was acid reflux. On Taxol, my knees felt like basketballs filled with broken glass that was rubbing together. For dose #2, he dropped my Neulasta shot from 6mg to 4mg. This helped so much! I had some bone pain from Neulasta on A/C #1-4 but nothing like that. They were just achy sore feeling then but I could walk at least. So lesson learned was don't give up, call your MO! I should have done that on day 4 and not suffered like that. Dose 2 I felt better, no nausea on Taxol at all for me but also no appetite, even with the steroids. I lose 8 lbs in 2 weeks, which I am kind of happy about..Buddha belly is shrinking! With the dropped Neulasta, my WBC did not drop much as I was worried it would. It went from 10 to 6. He told me yesterday I was borderline ready for a blood transfusion if I didn't eat more red meat. Ick I hate most red meat. A burger is ok.. Guess I'm eating at Red Robin tomorrow. My finger neuropathy has become worse on Taxol. MO asked if it was bad at beginning and tapers off, no mine is gradually worse. During the first treatment I didn't have any problems until about a week later. Started in left hand pinky and now is all fingers and thumbs. Sometimes feet go to sleep or get really cold for no reason. MO said take B complex to help with fatigue and nerve function. I found some chewable gummies on Amazon that are good made by Nutrition Now and have strawberry flavor for $8.80 for 70. Good luck to all the chemo-sabe sisters in the chair this week! I have my coloring books and Kindle ready for tomorrow. xoxo ",

My port placement will be Tuesday June 16, cocktail of A/C starts June 18, Neulasta shot June 19. Then two weeks later rinse and repeat.. 4 treatments with A/C then 4 of Taxol. 8 total to end in October. Then radiation. Hopefully I will be able to see my stepson play high school football some this fall. I have two wigs ready to go and a friend has provided me with many beautiful scarves and caps. Going to try and work as much as I can muster the energy to do so. Fighting a sinus/ear crud now so already started some steroids that have me amped up and certainly irritable, to my poor husband's dismay. Good luck ladies, look forward to reading your posts.",

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2015 01:12PM littletatas wrote: Hello fellow warriors, I enjoy reading all your posts, the good, bad, and ugly so I know I'm not alone and what to expect. I had AC #1 on June 18. #2 is tomorrow, a day early due to the holiday, they are closed Friday. The SE's have not been so rough as I built it up in my head... mostly fatigue, bone pain, and mild nausea, usually in the mornings. I was able to work all last week. I notice I have a headache when I take Zofran so I asked MO and he gave me a script for Phenergan today. My mom gave me Ginger Root capsules and they helped the nausea yesterday so I'm going to stick to that when I can. I've written in a journal daily just quick notes of how I feel, what SE is, and what I took to help. My MO said the next rounds (4 total A/C every 2 weeks, then Taxol for another 8 weeks) will be the same dose, so I'm hoping same side effects and not cumulative. Does anyone know? My hair is hanging on upstairs but starting to go \"down there\". Just a little shedding on my brush, from my head -- thought I should clarify lol. MO said I should cut it shorter (already have had the pixie for over a year) because it will go in the next week. It is a little tingly around the edges. I think I will have DH to cut it down to 1\" tonight as I'm tired of waiting and watching to see when it goes. This will be ONE thing I can control. I want to add my info to the SE log that a member started on the site but I can't find it. If anybody knows where it is, please put a link on here. Thanks and have a great week, we CAN do this!!",
