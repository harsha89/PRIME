After my mastitis case I had last august I went and got a ultrasound. Said everything was fine. So I continue here in there to feel this and it goes away at times. I've ignored it specially when I recently ended up at docs office over a burning raw feeling in right nipple. Like thrush. She prescribed antifungal meds. Didmt do anything.. I realized I had like a tiny sore on my nipple that was raw must have been why I confused thrush with it. So sore healed on rt nipple. Then pain began again on left breast below nipple that shoots to my back. So Dr felt my breast and where I told her the pain was she said she felt a small mass. I'm frikin out. On notes it says oval shape mass. Also I read that on ultrasound of August of last yr. They saw no mass but had ductal ectasia(thicking of ducts) normal. Seems that a lot of woman that nurse get that according to what I read and doc told me. Not sure why I wasn't told about the full findings of ultrasound of last time. So now I'm so worried. I go tomorrow for another ultrasound of that area plus other breast:/ I've nursed all 5 of my kids since 2003. Still Nursing My 12 m. Old. The pain is felt in my upper back as well as my left arm at times. Anyone know of any Nursing Moms that have been diagnosed? I want to know there first symptoms? My breast looks great from outside and only have pain and now that oval small mass she said she felt. I need to talk...anyone? Pls? Log in to post a reply",
