I have found it to be quite painful. Plus, the revolving door of nurses, doctors, etc. (yes, I am doing this over the holidays) have added to the discomfort. I've even received conflicting guidance from on-call docs (when I had an emergency over the holidays). I would never do this again and am very sorry that I wasn't more forceful in disagreeing with my docs on this and opting for the traditional treatment. It's a shame that there isn't more time to \"research\" these issues. I think that if the docs, themselves, underwent the treatment, they'd be much more circumspect in promoting it.",
