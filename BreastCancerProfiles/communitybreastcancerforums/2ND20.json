Doc has given me nausea pills and nausea tabs to take before chemo and for next two days. Have to have neuplasta (sp) too and 10 shots cause my drug plan doesn't cover the \"just one\" shot. Wish I could be a little more relaxed about this chemo. Just dont know what to expect. Hope I can still go to work and keep some normalcy in my life! ",
