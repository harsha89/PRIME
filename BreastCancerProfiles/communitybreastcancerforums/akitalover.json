So far so good. ..sorry your treatment was so rough. I think it depends on the different meds as well. I didn't see what they gave you..I was given TC today and the nurses were wonderful and went real slow to avoid any reactions and headaches, etc..I have an HMO that I had switched to recently, and I must say that I am very happy with all of my surgeons and treatment so far.",

He lives downtown San Diego,so will take the train up the coast to see me and shave my hair this weekend. My nurses advised me to do it..told me my scalp would get itchy and dry before fall out.. then we will go to Pt.Loma to check out the ACS wigs...I was told that SE will start day 7..so much information..good luck to all.we will get through this ..I am so lucky to have my beautiful white Akita, Christina by my side. She licked me over and over and I told me husband that maybe I have cancer....I got my butt into my missed mammogram appointment and guess what???? Now that is a true dog story!! Feel better",
