I had BiRads 4 as well. I am 29 years old and have breast cancer history with maternal aunt. I met with breast surgeon on Wednesday and she will be doing a excisional biopsy on August 18th. We scheduled it for then so that my mom and dad can be here for support..they live in California I am in Texas. My surgeon let me know that it would take 24-48 hours to get my results back after the surgery. I am super anxious, stressed, scared, and can't stop thinking about what it could be. While at my appointment she offered me a lot of statistics for breast cancer and that I am young so chances are low but that gave me no relief. I am sending positive vibes your way and hope and pray that everything will be ok for you!",

I am new to this group and decided to join to stop driving myself crazy and to stop over googling everything that it could be and to try and reach out for support for everyone else experiencing this. On Sunday I felt a lump in my left breast which worried me since I hadn't felt it before. I had a breast exam back in March an this lump was not there. So I called my Dr. office on Monday and I went in yesterday morning. We discussed my concern and she felt the lump and ordered a sonogram for me. I walked to the imaging center and had it done about an hour later. While I was having the sono the radiologist came in to have a look and was able to see the lump which is in a duct with blood flow that looked like it was around it. He explained to me how a normal duct should look and showed me a normal one and then showed me the mass that was in a duct. He went ahead and ordered a mammogram and said because of my age he didn't expect to see much but wanted to see if that lump would show up on mammogram as well. So I did the mammogram and then a 2nd set again on left breast. He recommended that I have an excisional biopsy to have it removed and tested. I got a copy of the report and it states: Findings: the breast parenchyma is heterongenously dense. No pathological calcifications no distinct mammographic findings in the right. Nodularity noted in the retroareolar region of the left breast near where patient palpates the finding at 2:00 position. Sonography preformed of left breast demonstrates multiple ectactic ducts in the region of palpable findings. Some of these demonstrate nodular filling defects up to 7mm diameter perhaps correlating to some of the nodular breast tissue seen on the mammogram. No posterior acoustic shadowing. Impression: suspicious left periareolar abnormality correlating to a palpable finding reported by the patient. Surgical consultation for excisional breast biopsy should be considered. BI-RADS:4 Sorry so long but I wanted to give a clear view of what I am not understanding. I am 29 years old and my maternal aunt was diagnosed at age 32 with breast cancer and she did not take the BRACA test to see if it is a carried gene. If you have any insight, good or bad please let me know. I have my consultation scheduled on Wed, July 29 so until then I am a worried wart! Thank you !! Log in to post a reply",

I have calmed down just a little bit with the worries but of course my anxiety is pretty high today since my appointment is tomorrow. The BS that I will be seeing tomorrow called me yesterday to review and let me know what we would be discussing tomorrow and she did let me know that surgical biopsy will be scheduled. The BS wants to do another sonogram to check all areas of my breast since only that area was focused on during sonogram. I don't even know what questions to ask her tomorrow about the surgery or what it could be other than cancer. She did try to offer some relief by saying 80% of breast biopsies come but benign but then said \" but we definitely want to look at yours and see whats going on since there is some concerns\" so that didn't give me much relief. I appreciate yalls support! I will follow up after tomorrows appointment. If yall have any suggestions on questions I can ask, please let me know!",

I am pretty nervous about the surgery but I am ready for some answers. Luckily I will have the support of my husband and family coming down from california to be there for me when I get my results a few days later. I have been super stressed not only from this lump but also our house was broken into last tuesday :( Something has got to give! Looking forward to brighter days and better news!",
