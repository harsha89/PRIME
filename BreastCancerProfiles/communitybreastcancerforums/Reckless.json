I told my boss right away what's going on after I got the diagnosis. Worked until one day before the surgery. It was odd working - everything seemed so insignificant compared to what was going on with me. My mind was constantly on things concerning the diagnosis and treatments. I did manage to get the work done, though, and it was better than staying home where I would have been thinking about the disease 100% of the time. But, it was hard to cope with panic attacks at work and I was very uncomfortable making/ taking Doctor calls where my colleagues could hear me.",

And, since I am BRCA2+, all 3 gyn oncologists I consulted with, recommended the ooph. They all said that if I was not BRCA+, they would have observed the cysts for a few weeks.Luckily, everything turned out benign. I grew 8 cm and 5 cm complex cysts just within 6 months from the last TVUS, I attribute this to tamoxifen.",

There was some thickening too. An ultrasound showed that it was just scar tissue which seems to have dissolved since or maybe just flattened, I do not feel it any more. Good luck with your ultrasound",

I could have had the surgery sooner, but I took time deciding between lumpectomy/UMX/BMX and getting second opinions. But I find it strange that you do not know the next steps. Didn't the doctor who diagnosed you explained possible options and referred you accordingly? I was diagnosed by oncologist. When I came in, she gave me the diagnosis and discussed next steps/ treatment options. She referred me to the surgeon, as surgery was the next step in my case.",
