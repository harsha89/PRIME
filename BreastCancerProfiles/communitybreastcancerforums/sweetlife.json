Have you gone to CTCA yet?  If so, how did that go?  I switched my care over to them in July 2008.  There is both good & bad to say about them in my case as is probably true no matter where you go.  I rarely get to talk to my doctor, but he did finally call me yesterday...to tell me off for asking questions about his recomendations.  I have been devastated. He is really full of himself. I have had 2 radio frequency ablations and 1 chemo embolization to my liver...and they are recomending another ablation now.  The last one was only in Sept. 09.  I am not ready to do it again.  They also put me on chemo again & told me there are \"no side effects.\"  I have not found that to be true.  I am on Ixempra.  Feeling VERY tired & like tiny pins are sticking me all over, esp. my neck & tounge.  Weird. I am just struggling now.  My CTCA doc basically told me to either agree with him 100% and stop  getting other input and asking questions or go find another doctor because he has \"patients begging to see him.\"  Ugh!  Sorry I'm venting. I hope any new input you got is helpful! PS I go to the center in Philadelphia",
