      "Content": "Jun 10, 2012 05:27AM - edited Jun 10, 2012 05:54AM by wendy49 Thank you for your reply.  I'm not new to BC.  I had it in the other breast 10 years ago and had a UBX with SNB at that time without immediate reconstruction.  I had reconstruction the following year with an implant on my UBX side and a small implant on the other.  Now, I have BC in the other breast with the small implant.  I was wondering how long it takes now, with newer procedures/techniques, etc.   I have had a REALLY bad 4/5 weeks.  This all started on May 5th when I had emergency surgery for an appendix.  It took about a week to recover from that.  A week later, I was diagnosed with gallstones, which now needs to be removed because my diet is so limited due to the gallstones. THEN, came the big one, BC in my \"good\" breast.  Ugh . . . I'm gonna need a lot of support from you gals to get me through all this.  Ten years is a long time to be out of the loop of BC.  I am grateful I had the break though, because I'm going to need it for the gallbladder surgery and breast surgery, and I assume, the chemo.  I have an appointment with my BS on Monday afternoon for my ER/PR and HER-2 status.  My tumor 10 years ago was stage 2, 3 cm, HER-2 positive and ER/PR-.  My surgery was a UBX and 4 rounds of AC, with reconstruction with implants the following year. My thoughts for my meeting with my BC on Monday is this, and please tell me if I'm whacked out by this (because I reallly feel pretty whacked out right now), I want to know if its possible to do a LX with SNB, then have my gallbladder surgery, then chemo (if necessary) and then do the UBX.  That way I can get this cancer out of me NOW and find out if I have any nodes that are affected as well.  I don't want to mess around with this BC, I want it out!  Does any of this make any sense?   ",
