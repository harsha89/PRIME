The question is: is it possible the cancer cells already to be transferred to the rest of the body? If yes, will the chemo kill them? Is there a chance for metastasis even after chemo?

She had a mastectomy in the mean time. Doctors were positive. She is HER2 negative. And of we go for radiation. My mom is strong and positive, but i can not fight my depression and fear. Can she survive? I repeat the question all the time in my mind. In front of her i am positive and happy. Thanks for listening to me, Despoina",
