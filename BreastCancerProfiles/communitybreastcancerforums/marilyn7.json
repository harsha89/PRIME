My 2nd cycle was April 5th and I feel great right now, although a bit tired tonight after working this week.  I love my bald head!!  But I also love my wig.   ",

As for scans - I think it all depends on the lymph node involvement.  If you had no lymph nodes involved, there is a fair certainty that the cancer was contained in the breast.  If you had lymph node involvement, that's when you need chemo and scans.  I had 3 positive nodes out of the 18 removed, so I had bone, liver, lung scans.  No need for brain scans as the symptoms of brain mets would be apparent.  It was a very good day when my scans were negative.  Although, I think now that I'm done with surgery, chemo, and radiation, can't we do another round of scans just to be on the safe side - I will ask my onc. I'm sure it's a matter of insurance coverage.  I think they were several thousands. OK - I'm going for a walk.  I'm tired as hell, but if I fall off the exercise wagon I find it harder to do the next day.  Next time I talk to you I will be DONE!!!!!!! xo Marilyn",

My follow up schedule is that I'll see my med onc once a year and my surgeon once a year, but at 6-month intervals.  They work as a team and share notes / records so if anything is amiss, they will bring in the other doctor right away.  This goes on for 5 years - then I don't know what happens.  I saw my GYN the other day for my annual and assumes that my surgeon will handle my annual mammograms from here on out.  What I don't know is how often I see the rad onc.  I'll ask her on Tuesday.

About 8 weeks after surgery I developed AWS (auxiliary web syndrome or cording)  So I am back to PT and exercise. If you had the lymph nodes removed - keep up with your exercise through out your treatment.  And at the first sign of tightness (it runs from the arm pit, under the arm across the inside of the elbow, to the wrist) see a PT for massage and exercise.  Good luck everyone.  I'm half way through my chemo, and while it is now picnic, the predictable nature of the next cycle is comforting.",
