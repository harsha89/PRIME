Surgeon walked in, smiled, & said \"good news\". (Those 2 words sound *so* good together!) He had taken 3 generous tissue samples, & all were clean! So I've now been released into the care of my oncologist, & will have my 1st chemo treatment this coming Monday (4/14). Kimbly - I had surgery first (2 surgeries: a wide lumpectomy with ANLD, plus port insertion, on 3/13 which came back with clear margins on the tumor itself but \"islands\" of cancer cells found in some add'l tissue that the surgeon removed, plus approx 3 positive nodes out of 21 +/- taken. Second surgery was 4/3.) I'll start chemo next week, then I'll have radiation (with Herceptin continuing throughout), followed by a hormone-blocking therapy to be determined. Aurabelle - Sounds like maybe you've been keeping it together so much, for so long, and now it's all just pouring out of you. Go ahead & grieve, you've got a right to, & you need to let it out. I've allowed myself some crying time here & there throughout, although the day before my 1st surgery I was a total basket case. Best of luck to all the upcoming April surgeries, & I hope that everyone's recoveries go smoothly!",

Both times, I woke up quickly & thoroughly, & began chatting with the nurses. For the 1st surgery, which was close to 3 hours (& also included getting a medi-port implanted for chemo), they had given me something that totally dried out my mouth, lips, & tongue, so that when I spoke (after waking up), everything got all pasty & stuck together, and they'd only let me have baby sips of water or a couple of tiny ice chips, then later some baby sips of apple juice. They kept asking if I was nauseous, & I wasn't. Because my surgery was later in the day, they didn't let me have any solid food til breakfast, which I wolfed down, & then sat & knitted. After my 2nd surgery (which was much shorter - I'm guessing less than an hour), I didn't have that pasty-mouth issue (they didn't give me the same thing, apparently), & let me have a cup of juice instead of just a sip.

I also had Emend; how much it costs depends on your insurance, but it's amazingly effective. I took the Emend an hour before tx, then again the next 2 mornings of each cycle. I had Decadron (a steroid, dexamethasone) and Aloxi by IV just before tx. I also took Decadron tablets each of the next 3 mornings of each cycle. The combination was enough that I didn't need to take either of my other 2 anti-nausea meds (Compazine & Ativan) at all during those first few days of each cycle, & I only occasionally needed to take a Compazine (the milder of those two).  I'd recommend eating something light before tx, & bring some snacks, like crackers or pretzels, & apple slices.  What you heard about the ice chips relates to the Adriamycin, & I definitely recommend it. Adriamycin can cause mucousitis (sp?), & sucking on ice chips throughout the Adriamycin drip chills the blood vessels in your mouth & \"is thought to\" prevent/reduce the chances of getting mouth sores (a result of the mucousitis). I put the \"is thought to\" in quotation marks because supposedly there's no conclusive evidence, but a good friend of mine who's an oncology nurse recommended the ice chips (or lots of popsicles - but those get really melty & drippy, really quickly), plus my onc's office routinely offers & recommends the ice chips, & I did that for all 4 tx's & didn't get mouth sores at all. (Well, except that now I seem to have a white spot on the underside of my tongue, but I think that's thrush - some fungal thing, rather than a mouth sore.) Another suggestion, re: Cytoxan - It can give you a headache, depending on how long the drip is for. (Shorter drip = more likely to get a headache.) Ask them how long the Cytoxan drip will be for; if less than 1/2 hour, ask them to give it for 1/2 hour, at least. I had my 1st one for about 45 minutes with a slight headache, & the rest for an hour each without getting a headache. And another suggestion - I don't know about you, but I had a hard time accepting help at first, let alone asking for it. People really do want to help (some of them, anyway), so think of things that different people can do for you. For example, I asked a good friend of mine who's a great cook (& is good at cooking large quantities) to cook a huge pot of chicken soup, which we then froze in individual portions. I've still got most of them (& I've also got lots of tx's ahead of me), & it's nice knowing they're there. I asked some fellow knitter-friends to knit some hats for me; I supplied the yarn & patterns. Other friends have helped with rides (& will hopefully continue to help that way!), & others are on hold, waiting for me to let them know what I need & when. Good luck!",

My experience has been minimal pain on 2 different occasions (each of which only lasted one day or less), otherwise no pain - and I've now been through 3 cycles, so 24 injections! One thing that my onc told me is that you really want to be sure to space the Neupogen injections 24 hrs apart, at the same time each day (or night), because if you get 2 injections closer together, that can cause (additional) pain. So if you get off-schedule & get one injection later than planned, you should probably use that as the time for the rest of your injections for that cycle.",

Immediate margins were clear, but my surgeon had taken a couple of extra samples, & they found \"islands\" of cancer cells in one of those samples, so I went back (early April) for a wider lumpectomy (\"re-excision\").  My original tumor was approx 4cm x 3.4cm by 3cm (give or take, I don't remember off-hand - but fell somewhere within \"stage 2\"), and I had enlarged lymph nodes in my armpit.  My surgeon was leaning towards a sentinel node biopsy at the time of the original lumpectomy, but the oncologist & radiation oncologist (both of whom I'd already met with) both seemed to feel that I should just have the lymph nodes removed, given the size of the tumor & that the biopsy indicated my cancer is/was grade 3 (refers to level of cell differentiation & aggressiveness, with grade 3 being the poorest differentiation & most aggressive).  Plus a good friend who's an oncology nurse also suggested removal.  So that's what we did. I had a port inserted during my 1st surgery, and I strongly recommend getting one if you'll be getting chemo for more than 4 or 6 treatments or so, especially if you have weak &/or skinny veins.  My port turned out to be picky; it will accept infusions without any problems, but it doesn't like to give blood, so they've had to revert to drawing blood from my arm or hand (to run the labs) & use the port for the infusions.  Since the needle they use to draw blood is slimmer than what they'd have to use to place an IV, it's working out ok.  Most ports aren't so picky, & are used both for the blood draws & infusions.  I started chemo in mid-April, 11 days after the 2nd surgery.  I began with 4 dose-dense (\"dd\") treatments of Adriamycin & Cytoxan (\"AC\").  (Dose dense, for AC anyway, means treatments every 2 weeks instead of every 3 weeks.  It can be tougher on your body, since you have less time to rebound & feel better between treatments, but you finish up sooner, & it's believed that dd treatments give the cancer cells less time to rebound & grow back, too.)  AC is reported to be one of the toughest protocols to be on, although the various drugs to deal with side effects are amazing.  ---> One important note about Adriamycin: It can cause mouth sores. Many people suggest sucking on ice chips (or popsicles, or similar) while you're actually getting the infusion; this was recommended to me, & I did it for all of my Adriamycin infusions, & I never had any mouth sores.  Many places will provide ice chips for you. (Some oncologists will say there's no conclusive evidence; my advice would be that it works for so many people, so do it anyway.) <---  While on AC, I took Emend at home before treatment, & again the next 2 mornings.  I was given Decadron (dexamethasone, a steroid), plus Aloxi (another anti-nausea med) by IV right before treatment, & I took Decadron by tablet the next 3 days at home.  I also had prescriptions for Atavan (anti-pain, anti-nausea, & anti-anxiety) and Compazine (anti-nausea), but I only took Atavan once, & Compazine only a few times during the first two cycles. (Both can make you drowsy; the Atavan pretty much knocked me out & left me feeling drugged for a day or so afterwards, and I didn't even need it, but took it the night after my first treatment at my friend's suggestion - plus they'd put it in the IV that morning before treatment, which I requested they not do again, & it turned out I never needed it.)  I was very fortunate in that I never had nausea, only some moderate indigestion from time to time that were taken care of by OTC meds.  AC, as well as some of the other chemos, can cause significant drops in your white blood cell (\"WBC\") counts, so typically, patients either go back (generally the day after treatment) for a shot of Neulasta, or self-inject Neupogen at home for a number of days between treatments.  Both Neulasta & Neupogen cause your body to produce more WBC's, and both *can* cause bone &/or joint pain, anywhere from severe to moderate, or even non-existent.  I had to inject myself with Neupogen for 8 days out of each 14-day cycle (cycle = length of time from one treatment to the next).  I need to tell you that I am a total wimp & wuss, & very squeamish.  I did not expect to be able to give myself the shots, so you can imagine how surprised - more like shocked - I was when I gave myself the 1st shot, and not only didn't find it painful or difficult, but I hardly even felt it.  I was also fortunate in that I had no bone pain to speak of, only 2 times when I had minor achiness, which was easily managed with one dose of Tylenol (extra-strength) or Aleve.  I finished the AC in late May, & was scheduled to start on Taxol & Herceptin 2 wks later, but postponed it due to my mom's death & her funeral out of town.  Postponing it was one of my better decisions.  Since side effects can be cumulative, & my worst side effect with AC was fatigue, I crashed for about 10 days starting the day I returned home after my mom's funeral.  That was my lowest point - physically, mentally, & emotionally, at least for that length of time, since this whole ordeal began.  So, I had my first of 12 weekly treatments (\"tx's\") of Taxol plus Herceptin, on June 9.  Either or both of these can cause allergic reactions, so they give you Benadryl by IV before they start.  (Keep in mind, though, that procedures vary from doctor to doctor.)  They also had me take 20mg of Decadron the night before, plus another 20mg of Decadron as well as Zofran (I forget the strength) 2 hrs before my appt.  When everything went well, they told me to drop the Decadron to 8 mg each time (nighttime & pre-treatment).  I did that for the next couple of tx's, & lowered it further to 4mg each time (which is only one tablet) each time, so I'm not going any lower even though I still have no reactions.  They also gave me 50 mg of Benadryl the 1st tx (in 2 increments of 25mg each, once before the Taxol & once before the Herceptin), but have only given me one 25 mg dose since.  This is partly because, on this protocol, the first Herceptin tx is much larger than for subsequent tx's, and partly because I had no allergic reaction.  Taxol generally causes much less nausea than AC, & I've had no nausea, & only rare indigestion.  Taxol *can* also cause bone &/or joint pain, again, anywhere from mild to severe.  And again, I've been fortunate that, so far, at least, I've had none.  Today was my 7th tx out of 12, & my worst problem continues to be fatigue, but it's not as bad or disabling as the fatigue I felt while on AC.  Other potential side effects include neuropathy, and/or hand-&-foot syndrome - neither of which have gotten me (at least not yet!). Once I finish the current 12-tx program of Taxol & Herceptin, the Herceptin will drop down to once every 3 wks til I've been on it for a year (est mid-June '09).  Also, I'll have radiation, 33 treatments, 5 days/wk for almost 7 wks (during which I'll continue to get Herceptin tx's).  Once radiation's done, I'll start on some hormone-blocking therapy (to be determined at this point) which is generally taken at home for 5 yrs.  Both Adriamycin & Herceptin can cause heart damage, so they don't like to give them together.   Typically someone who gets both of these will be sent for periodic scans, either an EEG or a Muga scan, which is more involved but is supposed to show more detail than the EEG.  I had a Muga scan before I started chemo, a 2nd Muga scan after I'd finished my AC tx's & before I started the Herceptin, & I'm due to have another one soon.  Herceptin is only given to people whose cancer is \"HER2\" positive.  Hormone-blocking therapies are only given to people whose cancers are estrogen &/or progesterone positive.  I happen to be \"triple-positive\", which I guess is fairly unusual. One very important thing to keep in mind is that each person's experience is different, even with the same chemo & same drugs to handle side effects.  I was terrified before I started.  It seemed to me that I saw so many horror stories, & so few reports of tolerable/manageable side effects (let alone reports of none!), that left me quite anxious. You'll find tons of support, understanding, & encouragement here on these boards. Don't be afraid to ask questions!  Also check out some of the other threads (The Road to Hell, and Whining, among them) for some much-needed relief.  Well, I've gone on alot longer than I anticipated.  I hope that at least some of what I've rambled about is helpful to you!  Please feel free to ask more questions, either here or by private message, if you'd like!  Take care & let us know how things go for you!

I'm tentatively scheduled to start my chemo (4 dose dense cycles of A/C to start) on the 14th. My biggest fears are the potential pain from Neupogen, & being thrown into full-blown diabetes by the steroids (I'm borderline now). I went wig shopping about 10 days ago, pre-chemo, at the suggestion of a friend who is an onc nurse. The woman at the wig shop took the time to tell me about \"wig shock\" before I even tried anything on. She said that it's hard to see yourself in a wig, particular in a different hairstyle &/or color, & you feel that you're not really looking at yourself in the mirror. She said some people get so freaked out, they pull the wig off & run out of the store screaming or crying. I can relate to everything looking wiggy, but I think that once we don't have our own hair, the wig will look pretty good in comparison. Some of the online places will let you purchase color swatch samples. I'm concerned with the fit (since I have a fairly large head) as well as the color & texture. I did end up buying one wig at that shop, & I'm contemplating getting a second, but I'm really not sure how much or how often I'll actually wear a wig. I bought a couple of cotton knit (fabric) hats, & am knitting up a bunch of hats in different colors & styles, and also have several women in my knitting group knitting up hats for me. - Otter, you've given so much help & support to so many of us. You're perfectly entitled to vent when you need to! Hang in there, & hopefully your next wig-shopping outing will do the trick for you! Susan",

I take Emend an hour before tx, then they give me Decadron & Aloxi thru the port pre-tx, but the 1st time they also gave me Ativan (plus I took another Ativan before bed later that night) so I felt really drugged for a couple of days. This time I asked the nurse whether I could get the Ativan at any time during the tx if I skipped it up front but found I needed it; she said I could. So I tried without it, & wound up not needing it at all. No nausea, not even any queasiness, & I didn't have that heavily drugged feeling afterwards. I also had her give me the Cytoxan at a slower drip rate than the 1st time, & I didn't have that dull headache this time, either. (It helps that I've got a good friend who's an onc nurse & gives me all sorts of advice!) So today's day 4 of cycle 2, & I'm doing ok. I'm splitting today's dose of Decadron (the last for this cycle) in 2 - 1/2 today & 1/2 for tomorrow, with my onc's ok - to see if I can prevent the major crash I had last cycle on my 1st non-Decadron day. I started back at work on Tuesday after having been off since March 13th for the 2 surgeries & thru the first cycle (and 2nd tx). So I'm a little tired & needed to put my head down for awhile yesterday. That might need to be a regular thing, & if it is, my boss will just have to accept it!  I had my hair cut shorter last Wednesday, & it just started to fall out on Tuesday, more hair in/on my hands than usual when I washed it. Nothing on the pillow yet, but this morning I noticed a small bunch of hair just sitting on my shirt. I think once it really starts falling out in clumps I'm going to have my daughter give me a buzz cut. I suspect that might be over the weekend, but we'll see. I've got a bunch of hats ready, & a wig, too, although I'm not sure how much I'll want to wear the wig. Glad to hear that everybody seems to be handling their tx's pretty well.  My worst fear was the Neupogen - how I'd handle giving myself the injections (since I tend to be extremely squeamish) as well as the reportedly horrific bone pain. I have to say, doing the injections has been surprisingly easy! And the bone pain has been minimal, & easily managed with Tylenol (and now I'm allowed to take my favorite Aleve).  My counts have been good so far, & I'm hoping that they continue to be.",

It hasn't been proven conclusively, but from many people's experiences - mine included (3 tx so far w/o any mouth sores) - keeping the mouth cold while receiving the Adriamycin helps prevent the mouth sores from forming. Linda (lewing) - I think you've got the right idea to have what's left of your hair shaved off, or at least buzzed super-short, and to have it done at home if possible. I had my daughter give me a super-short buzz cut the Sunday before last, otherwise I'd have faced the same shower situation as you described, & I decided to get rid of the hair first. Doing it in the privacy of my home was much less traumatic than if I'd gone to a shop, I think. Well, I had tx #3 yesterday (A/C, dose dense). My port was acting finicky. It would accept incoming fluids but didn't want to work in reverse to allow the blood draw for the pre-tx labwork. It was as if there was some sort of flap closing off out-flow access to the port. It's been finicky before, but the nurse got it to work the first 2 times. Same nurse this time, but it just wasn't working. I mentioned that she could just draw the blood from a vein & use the port for the tx, but she (rightly) mentioned that the port should work both ways & if there's a problem it should be cleared up sooner rather than later. So she got the onc's permission to administer some enzyme (TPA, I think she said), which can take anywhere from 1/2 hour to 1.5 hrs to work. Of course, it took the full 1/5 hrs. If it didn't work at that point, I was going to insist on the draw from a vein. On top of that, when my labs were done (mid-cycle) the previous Monday, my white cell counts were low. So if they came back low again yesterday, or at least if they'd come back too low for me to get my treatments, I think I'd have screamed. Fortunately, my WBC counts rebounded spectactulary, way higher than they were even before my 1st tx! So I had my treatments, but with all that time trying to get the port to cooperate, I was there a total of 6 hours! And yesterday's blood work showed that my RBC counts are low. They weren't worried about them, so I guess they're not critically low. But I guess that also helps explain why I've been so tired. Broke out in what first appeared to be a rash on my face, sort of along both sides of my nose, Sunday evening a little while after I ate dinner. It was red with lots of little bumps. I thought maybe it was an allergy to something in my dinner, though I couldn't figure out what. It looked slightly improved (mostly just less red) by the time I went to bed. Then yesterday, not red at all, but the bumps looked more like pimples & some of them had little white heads. Today, almost all gone! I'm still not sure what it is/was, but I'm glad it didn't last long! (Also glad that I didn't run out & spend lots of money on different treatments & solutions for it!) One more AC left (5/27), then it'll be 12 weekly cycles of Taxol + Herceptin (followed by rads + Herceptin every 3 wks).",

One of the counts (hemoglobin, I think) is down to 9.4, so they sent some of the blood for more labwork to test for the cause - which will likely *not* be something that an iron supplement can cure, meaning I'll probably be getting a shot or infusion of Procrit or similar when I go in tomorrow. I'm not eager for another treatment/medication/whatever, but then again, my low RBC's have been leaving me more easily short of breath & more quickly tired/tuckered out, so if this will help, bring it on!  Anyone else scheduled for cocktails tomorrow?",

But a good friend of mine happens to be an oncology nurse (not at my onc's but that doesn't matter), so if need be, I can have her show my daughter how to do it. Got my prescriptions filled the other night for Emend, Decadron, Ativan, Compazine, & Emla cream. But the store near me was out of the Emend, so they faxed the Rx over to another store. Went to pick it up today, & they were only giving me one tri-pack, & I'm going to be getting dose dense, so I should get 2 tri-packs to = a 30-day supply. Turns out the onc's office goofed, & wrote the Rx as if I'll get tx's every 3 wks. They called the onc's office (fortunately there's someone on call 24/7), got a call back pretty quickly from a P.A. who authorized the change to the Rx. Now I've just got to wait for the Neupogen to be delivered on Tuesday. Oh, yeah, and go for my 1st tx on Monday. I'm definitely feeling more nervous about it than I was a couple of days ago, but I'm also kind of psyched in the weirdest way that I don't understand (& certainly couldn't begin to explain). Got my hair cut moderately short a few weeks ago, & will get it cut much shorter during the week. Depending on when it starts to fall out, I might be out of town, so I'm not sure if I'll get it shaved off before I go, or just wait & see, play it by ear. I've already got a wig (though I'm not sure how often I'll want to wear it), a couple of knit fabric hats, & a bunch of hand-knit hats with more of those on the way.",

After brunch, I took my daughter to get some much needed shoes, shorts, etc. (The weather's beautiful here in northern VA, too!) Tomorrow w/b the test of wearing a hat at work.

I woke up last Friday AM with the entire side of my face, from just under & next to my eye all the way down to my jaw, swollen & sensitive to touch or pressure. So I called my onc's office & they said to come in at 1pm. I figured I'd go, get looked over, & leave with some sort of prescription to get filled. By the time I got there, that side of my face had that reddish look to it. Well, the nurse practitioner took a look at the swelling, said she thought it was some sort of infection (which is what it seemed to me, too), & she wanted the dr to take a look, too. So my oncologist examined my mouth & face, & then conferred with an infectious disease specialist at one of the local hospitals. I have to admit that I haven't been to a dentist in years & have several teeth with \"issues\", & the infection likely started or entered through one of them. My guess is that because of the mega-doses of steroids that I'd just taken (20mg of Decadron Monday night & another 20mg Tuesday morning, pre-Taxol & Herceptin tx), & considering that steroids suppress your immune system, that the infection took advantage of that opportunity to settle in & spread. Next thing I know, I'm getting IV infusions of 2 antibiotics at the onc's office while they decide what to do with me for the weekend. Decision was that I had to go to the hospital for round-the-clock IV antibiotics (not continuous, more like every few hours between the 2 meds, but round the clock). So I checked myself in Friday night (after getting groceries for my daughter for the wkend, plus an emergency run to Kmart for underwear since I was on my last clean pair - of course!, packing a bag, & having a quick dinner), thought I'd be there til Monday morning, but was discharged Sunday afternoon with a prescription for an oral antibiotic. The swelling seems to have gone down completely, but I'm on the meds til I finish them, which should be next Wednesday.  I had been scheduled for tx #2 of Taxol + Herceptin yesterday, but my onc had me postpone the tx for a week, so no tx this week. I have an appt tomorrow AM with the nurse practitioner, for follow-up on my infected face. Hopefully there'll be no surprises!  Angie27 - Congrats on finishing AC! ...To answer your question, I didn't have any se's to the Taxol + Herceptin treatment, at least not the 1st one (the only one I've had so far), unless you count that opportunistic infection that set in.  For the 1st tx, they had me take 20mg of Decadron the night before plus another 20 mg + a Zofran two hrs before treatment. They gave me the Herceptin first, preceded by 25mg IV infusion of Benadryl. They did the Herceptin over a 90-minute drip; normally it's 30 minutes but they do it slower the 1st time & then monitor you for an hour afterwards. The monitoring time overlapped the Taxol infusion so as not to make the appt even longer. They gave me a second 25mg IV infusion of Benadryl, then the Taxol. I don't remember how long the Taxol drip was; I think either 30 or 60 minutes.  I didn't have any reactions to either of the meds, just felt sleepy from the Benadryl. I napped on & off for a few hours after I got home & was fine after that, went to work the next 2 days with no problems other than my swelling face. (I went to my knitting group Wednesday night, too, felt fine, & stayed for the whole 3 hours, plus.)  Hopefully tx#2 will go as smoothly, & hopefully your experience will be similar (minus the facial infection, though)! :)",

After that, Herceptin will drop to every 3 wks (unless there's another 1 or 2 wkly tx's before it switches, not sure at this point).  I'll start radiation sometime after the Taxol is finished; last I heard, I'll get 33 tx, 5 days/wk for not quite 7 wks.  As much as I had relatively minimal se's from the AC when I was on that, I've had even less se's on the Taxol & Herceptin combo.  Fatigue is still an issue, but it's not as severe or debilitating.  I had also experienced noticeable shortness of breath & was sure I had heart damage, but the Muga scan showed that my heart's still ok, & my onco said it's due to low RBC's.  (Hemoglobin got as low as 9.1.)  Somehow, with no intervention, my RBC's have improved, still lower than the target range, but much closer; my RBC \"today\" was 10.7. And I've noticed that I'm not quite so out of breath all the time.  No bone/joint pain, no hand-&-foot syndrome, and no neuropathy (as far as I can tell), at least not so far.  A few wks ago I noticed some slight swelling/puffiness in my right hand & fingers, but only the right, which is the side that the lymph nodes (& tumor) were removed from.  (I've now got a compression glove, which helps a lot - when I remember to wear it!)  Soon after the swelling came about, I noticed a slight decrease in sensitivity (but not total numbness, & no pain) in the tips of my right thumb, index finger & middle finger. So apparently I have a mild case of lymphedema, & the sensitivity issued seems to be related to that rather than HFS.  ...After radiation, I'll start on some hormone-blocking therapy to be determined. I guess my onco's waiting to see whether to classify me as pre-menopausal (in which case I'll get Tamoxifen or Evista or something else), or as post-menopausal (in which case it could be Arimidex or something else). Right now I'm technically peri-menopausal, since my last visit from Aunt Flo, as far as I can remember, was September '07.  (I'd have kept better records if I'd have known that it mattered!)  I'm still stubbly-bald (no hair regrowth, just some of the original stubble never fell out, but it's nearly invisible), & shortly after starting the Taxol, my brows began to fall out. I now have almost no brows, & I'm pretty sure that my lashes are thinning too.  Way back, I had bought eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, & eye shadows. But I haven't bothered with them, since I haven't worn any makeup since around late Feb/early March (between diagnosis & 1st surgery) since I seemed to cry it off every day, anyway.  So, since I've gotten used to seeing myself this way (& probably everyone who knows me, who's been seeing me at least fairly regularly, should also be used to it), I haven't bothered.  I still haven't worn either of the wigs I bought. Knitted hats are just so much more comfortable & so much easier!  (But as soon as I get home, the hat comes off.)  And being a knitter, I've been knitting them up in all sorts of colors to coordinate with my clothing.    Speaking of being a knitter, when I went in for my appt 2 wks ago, the tx room I was in was decorated with a handmade \"VIP ROOM\" sign, with various knitting-related comics/cartoons/jokes on the walls, plus a sheep (not live!) that stood about 15\" high & was about 2 ft long, standing on the floor looking into a basket of yarn.  There was also a dry-erase board that all the nurses & staff plus my onco had signed &/or written messages to me.  And there was also a certificate, in appreciation to me, for being a \"yarn good patient\".  They all know that I knit, since I always knit during my tx's.  It turns out that my onco knits, too.  She was the source of all the decorations, & it was her idea to do a VIP day for me.  I'd never seen any of the rooms done up for anyone before, although there could've been one (or more) sometime when I wasn't there.  I guess they don't do that with any regularity, though.  It was really sweet, & put a smile on my face.  Yikes, this post is getting quite long; I could blame it on not posting for so long, but to be honest, I tend to be wordy (to put it nicely).  Anyway, it's nice to hear that so many of my April chemo-pals are doing so well!  Take care & feel good!  Susan ",

I had a wide lumpectomy & ALND 3/13 (& had a port implanted for upcoming chemo), and I'm going in for a wider lumpectomy this Thursday (4/3). Tentatively scheduled to start chemo on 4/14, as long as my surgeon ok's it, otherwise I'll start as soon as he says it's ok. I met both my med onc & rad onc in almost back-to-back appts on March 4, & like both of them, as well as my surgeon, alot. Had bone scan & CT scan (chest/abdomen/pelvis) on 3/11 followed by another appt with med onc on 3/24. Scans show no signs of cancer anywhere else, but the CT scan showed a large (14cm) cyst on my right ovary. Total surprise to me - no pain or discomfort, no bleeding. Med onc had me see a Gyn, who (among other things) did blood test for CA125 (ovarian cancer test), which came back negative, & referred me for a pelvic ultrasound, which showed that the cyst, though large, is just a benign cyst, & that we just need to keep an eye on it. Yesterday afternoon I met with my med onc's nurse practitioner for a pre-chemo training/info session. So, my chemo will consist of A/C x 4, 2 wks apart. I had a Muga scan last Thursday, & my \"ejection fraction\" (I think that's what it's called, anyway) was 56; a recent study indicates that people with Muga results of 55 or higher seem to be able to tolerate -or, their heart muscle can tolerate- dose dense treatments, better than people with results below 55. So I said I'll give it a try, since it'll cut a month off my total treatment time & because it's believed to zap the cancer harder & faster. (And my cancer is grade 3, so I'm all for zapping it harder & faster.) But if that proves to be too much for me, we'll back off to every 3 weeks. I'll also be taking Emend & Decadron, as well as Neupogen (days 3 thru 8 of each A/C cycle). I had asked about the benefits of Neupogen vs Neulasta, & even though Neupogen tends to cause worse side effects, I agreed to give it a try since it's supposed to boost the white blood cell counts higher (than Neulasta), plus there's more room to adjust dosage & frequency of the Neupogen. But if that causes more pain than I can tolerate, then they'll switch me to Neulasta &/or try something else. (A good friend of mine is an oncology nurse, & when I told her my decisions, she said that's also what she'd recommend, so that gave me more comfort, too.) After the 4 A/C cycles, I'll have 12 cycles (weekly) of Taxol + Herceptin. After that, I continue on Herceptin once every 3 wks for a total of a year, & I'll start radiation. After radiation, I'll go on hormonal therapy; I'm guessing Tamoxifen but I don't think my med onc has decided for sure. I'm really happy with my \"team\" of doctors (which is why I fired that Gyn - but that's another story that I went into, in great detail, on another thread!). My med onc & her staff are warm & responsive; they encourage questions, provide options & tell me the pros & cons of each, & give me a say in my treatment plan.

Took my Emend & applied the Emend cream an hour before, as directed. (For those who haven't gotten there, the Emla cream, or the generic, really does work. Just apply liberally & cover with Saran wrap.) They gave me pre-meds of Decadron, Aloxi, & Ativan, then gave me the Adriamycin. I had brought popsicles with me, which I had to down quickly before they melted, & then they gave me ice chips. I have no mouth sores, & only minimal dry-mouth. I dozed off sometime during the Adriamycin. Then had the Cytoxan, then got a ride home. No nausea, just a slight dull headache & foggy brain, which may have been from the Ativan. I slept on & off the rest of that day & thru the night. (I took another Ativan before bed on the advice of a friend who's an onc nurse, but probably could've done ok without it. I haven't taken any Ativan since then.) My slight headache & still slightly foggy brain continued thru the next day, but were totally manageable with extra-strength Tylenol, which usually doesn't help me. Also took my Emend & Decadron, & took a dose of Miralax, preventively (& also on day 3, but not since). Day 3 & day 4, no headache or fogginess, still no nausea. On the night of day 3 I started my Neupogen injections (which I do days 3 thru 10 of each cycle). I was pleasantly surprised that I only had the mildest back pain the next morning, & Tylenol helped that, too! Day 5 was first day without steroids, & I crashed. No nausea, but no energy or appetite either, & my back pain was worse; I spent most of the day in bed. Day 6, a little better, but still low energy & appetite. Day 7, continued improvement, days 8 & 9 (yesterday & today) feeling back to normal. I haven't taken any anti-nausea meds since Saturday (day 6), & that was only one Compazine or maybe two each day on days 2 thru 6. I had an office appt with my onc yesterday afternoon. My blood counts are all good, which means that the Neupogen is doing its job. Considering how squeamish I usually am, & that I don't have a high tolerance for pain, I'm relieved that - so far, at least - the stories I'd read about Neupogen have not been my experience. And so far, no constipation or diarrhea, though I'm prepared for either! I realize that I can't count on continuing to feel this well throughout treatment, but it gives me hope that the whole ordeal might turn out to be more tolerable than I'd initially anticipated. I also realize that each person's experiences are unique, & I truly hope that I haven't upset anyone who is having trouble with their treatments. I'm only offering my experiences as a ray of hope for others who haven't yet started, that it isn't always as terrible as you fear it will be. Modern medicine has come a long way! Tiff2008 - Sounds like we're on the same regimen, at least to start. I'm on 4 tx of A/C dose dense (every 2 wks), so my 2nd tx will be Monday 4/28. After that, I go on 12 weekly tx of Taxol + Herceptin, then Herceptin every 3 wks (til I've been on it for a year). I also get rads after the Taxol's done, followed by hormone-blocking therapy for 5 yrs (overlapping the remaining Herceptin tx). Good luck on Thursday! And in case they haven't told you, the Adriamycin is red, & will make you pee reddish-orange for a day or so. Also, sucking ice chips or popsicles is thought to help prevent the mouth sores that Adriamycin can cause; I did the popsicles/ice chips thing & have no mouth sores, so I recommend it! Susan",

      "Content": "Apr 24, 2008 02:40AM - edited Apr 24, 2008 02:45AM by susansblues Angie - I've skipped over some of these posts, so somebody may have already gotten back to you on this: I'm also on A/C. I take the 1st of the 3 Emend (the 125mg tab) on tx day, an hour before tx. I also apply the cream (Emla or generic) an hour before tx; apply liberally & cover with saran wrap. I had a port inserted during my lumpectomy, & I'm so glad that I did. They draw the bloodwork thru it on tx day, plus give my the pre-tx meds & then the tx's thru it. The pre-meds they gave me on tx day were Decadron (steroid), Aloxi (anti-nausea), & Ativan (anti-nausea + anti-anxiety). (Next tx, I'm going to try w/o the Ativan; I was exceptionally sleepy the entire day last time, & my onc said I could try w/o it or w/half dose.) On days 2 & 3, I'm to take Emend (80mg) & Decadron (8mg) in the morning; day 4 continue with 8mg of Decadron in the morning. (I'm going to try splittin the 4th day's dose of Decadron into 1/2 dose on day 4 & 1/2 dose on day 5, to lessen the post-steroid crash that I had this time, with my onc's ok.) I also have prescriptions for Ativan as well as Compazine for use throughout the cycle, as needed - either one or the other as often as every 6 hrs. Either Ativan or Compazine may be taken together with (or overlapping) the Emend & Decadron, but the Ativan & Compazine should not be taken together or have their doses overlap. My onc told me to get Miralax, & they suggested I take a dose on tx day as a precaution (to avoid constipation). I didn't take one that day because I had no problems in that area, let's just say. I did take a dose of it the morning of days 2 & 3, but haven't needed to take it since, as nature has been moving things along. (I also have Immodium on hand but haven't needed that either.) The Compazine doesn't seem to be terribly constipating, at least not at the level I was taking it. I took Zofran to combat nausea from the pain meds I had after surgery, & that (plus the pain meds) was much more constipating for me. But each person is different. (A friend of mine who's an onc nurse actually recommends using stool softeners rather than laxatives, but I went with my onc's recommendation. Either w/b ok, though.) I took one Ativan before bed on tx day (post-tx, just to make sure I slept), & haven't taken any since. I took one Compazine each morning on days 2 thru 6, didn't take any more at any other time on those days, & haven't taken any since - and I'm now on day 10. The other thing I'm doing, at the suggestion of alot of posters on the boards here, plus on the advice of a friend who's an onc nurse, is taking a Pepcid Complete each morning. (You can take up to 2 of those every 24 hrs.) Yesterday I forgot to take it, had some indigestion, but nothing horrible, then remembered the Pepcid. I've been eating whatever I feel like, whenever I feel like it - most of the time the same kinds of foods that I'd been eating pre-chemo. A few days (for me, days 5 & 6) I had less of an appetite & ate lighter, easier foods. Chicken soup is great, also crackers or toast, & noodle-based dishes without too much sauce or spices. I've got 8 containers (at least a pint each) of home-cooked chicken soup in the freezer now, courtesy of a very good friend of mine. General advice re: meals - Eat smaller portions, more frequently. It's often easier to get through a small meal or a snack, not only physically by psychologically. And once you start having more successful eating endeavors, it'll get even easier. One general bit of advice: When people offer to help, LET THEM! Different people can help in different ways & at different times. My soup-cooker friend happens to be a good cook & is used to cooking in large quantities, plus she's my closest friend, so I had no trouble asking her to do this. I have other cooking-offers on hold (for when I'll need them), & have been spreading out the rides I ask for among several people. It really does make people feel good to help, & you'll feel better, too! Hope things go well for you!",

Otter - I only had my head buzzed on Sunday, so today's only day 4 being hairless. My hair actually was falling out on its own; I'd look down & see small clumps on my shirt, & if I so much as touched it lightly, I'd have a fistful. So my daughter (age 16.5) buzzed me, very loving & gently. Then we ran a lint roller over my scalp, which I've done a couple times since then. I was very self-conscious when we went out for brunch after the Big Buzz, but I soon realized that nobody was giving me a second glance, let alone staring. The downside is that, at work, a few people who know me have seemed to look right past me (or down at the floor) instead of looking at me as we approached each other in the hallway. Some people just aren't sure how to react, I guess. Most people have been treating me normally, though - or as normally as can be expected under the circumstances. My daughter thinks I look good near-bald (as I still have some stubble) & said I have a nice head, & she's supportive of whatever I want to wear on my head in public, even if it meant going hatless, & even when she's with me. :) I have a wig but haven't worn it yet & doubt that I'll wear it more than occasionally.",

I was supposed to have a Muga scan this past Monday (6/02), post-AC & pre-Herceptin (& Taxol, but necessary due to the Herceptin) & was scheduled to have my first Taxol + Herceptin tx next Tuesday (6/10), but I had to push both of them back a week because my mom passed away over the weekend & I needed to go out of town for her funeral. (To be honest, as sad as I am to have lost her, it's a relief to a great extent because she had advanced Alzheimers, & had been non-verbal for the past few years or so, and we'd been gradually mourning our loss of her for longer than that. But I'm still grieving, & it still makes for a very stressful time!  One side benefit was that I got to see my siblings - we're spread out in 3 different states - and now at least they can feel a little more comfortable because I look pretty good for someone in my situation!) And despite getting through all 4 dd AC tx's with no mouth sores, all of a sudden I've got this white spot on the underside of my tongue & a soreness that makes it very painful to eat, drink, & sometimes even to speak. I have an office visit with my onc tomorrow morning, so she'll give me something then. (I'm so glad I didn't postpone that appointment when I rescheduled the others!) I've been reading everyone's comments on the Taxol with great interest since I'll be starting that soon, & I've been a bit anxious about the potential se's (of that plus the Herceptin). I feel like I got off really easy with the AC (i.e., minimal se's from the AC, Neupogen, & other meds - other than fatigue, anyway), & I'm afraid I'm going to pay for it with this next chemo cocktail!  I know I'm going to get Benadryl in the IV with (or before?) the Taxol & that they'll be monitoring me; I'm also supposed to take 20mg of Decadron the night before, & another 20 mg that morning, 2 hrs before tx.  They also told me that the 1st Herceptin tx is given over 90 minutes, & if it goes well then the next one will probably take only 30 minutes. So I can count on being there pretty much all day. Guess I'll take lots of knitting with me; between the Benadryl & the steroids, I don't know which will win out & how sleepy or alert I'll be. Glad to hear that so many of you are doing so well!",

I think I was so precoccupied with logistics - errands I had to do before traveling, then the traveling out of town, the funeral & dealing with all the relatives, & traveling back home, that it was really only yesterday when her death truly hit me. I had my appt with my onc this morning, just an office visit/checkup. She's pleased with how everything feels, healing-wise, & no-new-lump-wise (detectable by manual exam, anyway). Turns out I don't have thrush or any fungal infection in my mouth, just plain soreness. I haven't been using the salt & baking soda water rinse because I hadn't really needed it, but they told me to use that &/or use hard candies & drink alot. Actually, my mouth is feeling a little better so far today than it had yesterday, so I'm hoping that I might actually be able to eat something solid tonight! (I've lost 8 lbs in the past 10 days, & while I need to lose weight, that's alot in that short time, & not the weight-loss method I'd recommend!) So I'm having my Muga on Monday, & then start Taxol + Herceptin on Tues6/17. My onc said I could still start on the 10th (day after my Muga) but then quickly agreed that an extra week off would probably do me good right now. I knew I liked her! :) Here's wishing everyone easy tx's & minimal/no se's! And have a great weekend; do something nice for yourself!",
