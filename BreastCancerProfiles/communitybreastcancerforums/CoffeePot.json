Thanks for organizing it. Leanne, my heart goes out to you. I remember an early post I think you made about 20 yrs not being enough(I think it was you?). And it isn't. Besides your very young age, I know how difficult it is with young children. While I'm quite a bit older, I do have a 4 yr old who has had a difficult year along with me. One morning as I was rushing to get to rads, she looked at me and said,\"Why did you have to go and get cancer anyway?\" She was really angry with me. I can see some behavior problems developing that I think are the result of this year. Anyway, Leanne, she is a girl and I know from my own sons, that boys have very different energy and I wonder how you keep up with them. I admire you so much and I've seen an incredible spirit developing in you from your posts. Do you have specific things you'd like for us to pray for (besides a cure, obiviously)? Please let us know--like help for childcare, time for you, etc. Remember all the things for chemo and try to do them again. What helped me most was the small frequent meals, lots of water, and walking. Please try to find time for yourself during all this. Leanne, you have touched us all so much--let us help you.",

I wish I was there to help you with your children or whatever you needed--do you have help with them when you do chemo? Anyway, whenever I start to worry, I like to spend time at the Recurrence and Mets thread--there are so many good stories with successful outcomes and so many brave women over there. I know you have the prayers of the entire board, but you also especially have the prayers of the September Sisters--keep us updated.",
