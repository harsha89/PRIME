    "Content": "Agirl4country wrote: I recently had my annual mammogram and was called by because of califications. I had the diagnostic mammogram on 6/10/2013. I have a stereotactic biopsy schedule for 6/17/2013. I have a cluster of califications and am fairly sure that it is some type of cancer but won't know till next Wednesday. Can someone give me some info on how the biopsy will feel like and should I be more concerned than I am? I am a widow with very little family so hopefully I will find some support here.
