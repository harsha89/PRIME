Drains in 7 different surgeries always took longer than a month to get removed. Even lower body workouts would be welcomed- tired of being a bowl full of jello here!",

Just had my implants removed a couple days ago due to 5 failed attempts, and now working on adjusting to the whole scooped out concave thing. Looks like I have a lot of sit ups and ab work in my future! How long did you ladies wait until you started to exercise? When I asked my doc he said at about 2 months out I could do a stationary bike, and then gradually move up to an elliptical. Seems like a long time to go, but I sure don't want to injure myself either. Have not been able to exercise for over 2 years due to the faild reconstruction process, so looking forward to getting my life back.",
