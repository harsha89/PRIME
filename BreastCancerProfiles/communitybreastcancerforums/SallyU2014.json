I ended up going to virginia hospital center breast center and had bilateral mastectomy by dr Molly Sebastian and PS working with her is dr Bedri. he recommended staged implant rather than DIEP, since I qualify for Nipple sparing mastectomy. I'm 3 weeks post op and going through the staged reconstruction - it's not fun to have draw bulbs and expansions. Still will need another surgery for exchange to the perms ant implant. ",
