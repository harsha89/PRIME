Mine is an 18, which means that I have a 12% chance of reoccurrence with or without chemo. It's right on the border. So now the question is do we want to treat aggressively because I'm 40 or trust the statistics? With the oncotype test I have the option to say no to chemo and I have very good data to support that. But if I have a recurrence, there will always be the question of whether or not we should have treated. And the doctor explained me that a recurrence means somewhere else in the body that will be treatable but not curable, So basically at my age, I recurrence would mean most likely eventually dying of breast cancer before anything else. That's why age is always a factor., That and knowing that I'm otherwise healthy, with no health problems that would indicate that I wouldn't get through chemotherapy and recover without any long-term effects.",

It's not the cancer causing that pain, it's the bone marrow making massive white blood cells to protect the body and pushing it out of the bones. It's not as bad with the following shots. Claritin can help because it diminishes the histamine response and you can take tylenol. staying well hydrated makes a big difference too. About 6 days after my first nuelasta shot the pain peaked in the middle of the night for me and was excruciating for about 45 minutes, but was better after that. But in that moment, I wished I had someone with me to at least get some tylenol in my body because I couldn't get out of bed. so she may not be done hurting yet. But I'm able to work in a school without getting sick thanks to those white blood cells.   Elizabeth",
