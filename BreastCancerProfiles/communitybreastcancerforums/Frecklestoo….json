I have been reading and posting on the \"Let's Draft a Letter To Washington\" post, and this is exactly what we're writing about. Not all of us. Some are writing regarding insurance coverage etc, and others are writing about all the research that has been going on for years, and we donate and donate and we need a cure. If you would like to read the posts and join us in a mass letter or email writing campaign, go to the advocate topics and read about it. I think if the thousands of survivors could get involved in this, it would be a huge eye opener in Washington. We sometimes need to speak up to get things done.",
