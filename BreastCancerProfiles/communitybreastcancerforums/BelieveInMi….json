I just read your post and my heart goes out to you. No doubt that the nausea and dizzieness are  a side effect from the radiation and you should definately talk w/the medical oncologist.  You are a precious, amazing woman. DON't let the BastXXX's drag you down. I feel crippled with what to say because I feel like it won't make you feel cured, but I wish with all my heart and pray that someone within your Medical Team take a wake up pill and follow your care and get you to a full recovery mentally and physically.
