We were all in shock. There is no history of cancer in our family.  My mom already has extensive arthritis pain that has disabled her; she has has high anxiety and has weathered a hard life.  She is still feisty though but we absolutely did not want her to have to go through this. But you know what?  She is making it through.   We were so unclear as to how this process works. We didn't even understand that you have to go through surgery before they can give you a clear understanding of what is happening.  She had to get a mastectomy because she had multi-centric tumors in different quadrants of the breast. A couple of things to think about as you go through this process:  You are stronger than you think.  Educating yourself is key so that you understand the implications of what they are saying.  See if you can schedule the injections for the sentinel node biopsy while you are under anesthesia or some sort of sedative. Although some women describe the pain is minimal, my mom was in extreme pain from the injections (it was worse than anything she's been through).  Make sure you understand how to fix the post-surgery drain if it stops working.  My mom had a lot of trouble with the drain and ended up getting an infection that put her back into the hospital.  Demand that they give you a home healthcare nurse who can check in on you everyday or so after the surgery.  Get a copy of every single shred of paperwork that shows your diagnosis. Our local lab input some wrong data that completely changed my mom's options for treatment.  One day we were told she wouldn't need chemo and a week later chemo was the only option she had. When in doubt, get a second or third opinion if necessary to make you feel comfortable. My mom didn't want to \"rock the boat\" but now we are sending her slides to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion pathology report. They will do it remotely and insurance should pay for it (only $225). Phone number is 410-955-2405 for instructions. I'm very proud of my mom for how she's done so far. And seeing other women's stories on the internet has helped us to recognize that we too will move past this.  And so will you. Good luck and be strong!",

It's all about breast cancer and you can asks questions on the weekend and they will post a reply within a few hours.  You can also do a word search to find relevant info. www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/. ",

The path lab said the secretary inputs the info into the hospital record and then they also fax over the original to the oncologist office.  When we saw the oncologist, they were reading off the hospital record (with the wrong info). We were told that she didn't need chemo at the time. A week later we were called and asked to come to the oncologist's office immediately. My mom refused until someone told her over the phone what was going on.  I spoke with the path lab MD (who called me from her vacation) and she told me that the overworked secretary had put in the wrong info from the  original outside lab report.  She said that someone at the oncologist's office saw that the findings in the hospital report and the findings from the outside lab were different.  She also told me that they had had a weekly cancer conference and that my mom's case had been presented (prior to finding the error). She said that she did notice that it was unusual to have such a high grade tumor with such high positive markers. She even made this comment at the conference.  I asked her if at that point she thought of checking the data and she said no.  The oncologist said that someone at the lab saw the error (so we're still not sure). There was also another women who was switched with my mom's info. So she  was told she was triple negative and then a week later told she had ++-.  We are still reeling and in denial that  my mom needs chemo but slowly accepting it. ",
