I'm still at that painless little lump that is now painful because I can't stop feeling it hoping it's gone or smaller.  So nervous waiting for the phone to ring and I fluctuate between terror, crying and cleaning like a tornado.  I will update my results when I can and you are all in my thoughts.

Hugs racingheart ",
