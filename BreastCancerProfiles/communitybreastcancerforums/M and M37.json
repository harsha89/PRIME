I\u2019m joining this group as I had My first round of radiation today. It was supposed to be yesterday, but the machine wasn\u2019t working. I live in the Chicagoland area and we been slammed with some super serious weather Recently which can affect the machine- not sure what they call it Crazy cancer journey getting used to the new normal here which is each day. Reading about all the undisclosed side effects is making me a little nervous. I too was told it would be like a sunburn. Also I have A pretty hefty treatment plan 28 treatments +5 boosts. I\u2019m still suffering from some neuropathy from my chemo. Scared of more pain. In any case this is not a place of fear it is a place of support so as I said I\u2019m stopping in to learn from your expertise. Can anyone recommend some good additional lotions? I do have sensitive skin but no formal allergies. Any other must have us to get through to the other side? Thank you",

I\u2019m also finding that some of the people around me, family, friends, coworkers, although they pay lip service to accommodations for the cancer, have the same expectations of me as before.

My white counts were good and the doctor prescribed nystatin for my mouth. It\u2019s a swish and swallow and though I haven\u2019t had any problems with my extracted tooth yet, it\u2019s been really hard on my stomach. I opted not to use the PRN Ondansetron for nausea much this round since the last time I was so constipated. I finally caved and took a half a pill a couple hours back. My first day was so much better than today is. I even have the thought yesterday that this was going to be easy, ha ha Ha ha ha- been sipping down ginger tea and sucking on ginger candy all the while frantically brushing my teeth and swishing and swallowing. Consulting my yoda pipe all the while. Had a productive morning though I did give myself a very short crew cut as my once long and beautiful curly hair refuses to give up the ghost and still keeps growing and shedding and growing. Went out and bought some biscuits and gravy, everything I\u2019m eating a soft because I\u2019m so paranoid about getting food bit stuck in my freshly pulled Tooth hole Does anyone have an any insight on the steroids? Why do we take them, are they supposed to treat nausea? I sort of feel like they cause Nausea or maybe I\u2019m just so ridiculously nauseous that everything causes nausea. Sue from Sydney how ridiculous about that request from your job. Way against the law. You\u2019re more likely to catch something from them then they are Chromeo. I actually have my own little bathroom cleaning kit. I get it though. People are treating me differently at my job. It\u2019s really weird, not all of them but a lot of them. Some of them just kind of stand by my desk and give me this bizarre eulogy like this confession about how much they\u2019ve always liked me and anything they can do to help me and etc. etc. people that I just know I\u2019m passing is kind of weird and it could disingenuous or maybe it\u2019s genuine how people tell deeper thoughts when they\u2019re under pressure, mostly I think they\u2019re just uncomfortable, I don\u2019t know what to say to most of them. I mean some of them I think are trying to make themselves feel better. All I can really think about is when they\u2019re standing there and I hope they don\u2019t get too close to me because I\u2019m worried about my white count and want to get on with my work- which incidentally does not give a shit that I have cancer. I just love the normal days. I had about three really good normal days last week where I felt really healthy. I too have not given up my 2 cups of coffee in the morning. It helps keep me regular and I would just be a basket case without it. I have given up on my double shots and daytime coffee us as well as any caffeinated soda. Ginger ale for me. Well hopefully tomorrow\u2019s a better day for me and all you lovely ladies. You are so inspirational. Sorry about my rant, but if I can\u2019t blow it out here I don\u2019t know where else I can. Hbluv- I have thought about where I\u2019m going to go on my chemo, then heart surgery, then rads are done. I really wanted to go to Corfu off of Greece, but my fantastic boyfriend and tireless caregiver is a ridiculously silly Game of Thrones fan and I think we may be going to Belfast to look at one of the GOT castles- maybe we can do both. Seems like such a long time away but it\u2019s nice to have something to look forward to. I hope we are Sleep well tonight.  ",

At least it\u2019s a short week this week although I\u2019m just having a small Thanksgiving and skipping the big family party. Too many sick little kids and early winter colds to risk it. The isolation is a little intense- not always in a bad way. I kind of craving it sometimes, and sometimes not. My fellow was sick this week and so I made him stay away. Had to go through this first round of side effects by my lonesome. The neuropathy seems to have resolved itself, A few twinges here in there, like someone\u2019s got a voodoo doll of me and is sticking me with a pin every now and then. I am having some muscle pain and my feet are really weird. When I\u2019m wearing my shoes at work, feeling like my big toenails are about to come off and I kind of waddle around like a duck. Thinking about ordering extra wide shoes that are a half size too big . People want to hug me and it\u2019s so stupid when I tell them not to. Some of them react like they\u2019re so offended. I don\u2019t even hug my mother these days. Has anyone tried gabapentin? How about acupuncture? I feel much differently about reconstruction now that I\u2019m down the road apiece. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m gonna stay half flat. Maybe get a cool tattoo. You\u2019re right it\u2019s much less a focus then I thought it would be. My Masectomy site is really healthy, this may be different after radiation. From what my lymphedema therapist tells me it will be considerably different. I\u2019ve yet to consult the radiation oncologist- getting a second opinion from a heart surgeon on December 5. Once I have that I will get the radiation scheduled. I hear you about the light at the end. My last chemo treatment is December 27. I\u2019m so looking forward to getting off this crazy carousel. I know that there\u2019s still many challenges ahead of me but at least this slow poisoning will be behind me. Hoping everyone has an appetite the dayafter tomorrow. Hang in there!",

It seems to be resolving if I lower the salt in my diet, but I know that\u2019s indicative of heart function. I do see a lymphedema therapist and she is amazingly wonderful. She does massage on my Mastectomy site and chats and counsels me throughout. I would recommend it highly to anyone. I have not heard about wearing a sleeve during rads but I will certainly ask her when I see her next Monday. Congratulations to everyone who is finished with chemo!

There\u2019s really nothing anyone can do for you then. You just have to get to the other side. I\u2019m scheduled to see the hotshot cardiac surgeon tomorrow. Heading out to one of the teaching hospitals that\u2019s out of network. I want to see what he has to say about asending aortic aneurysm. It\u2019s not a matter of if, just a matter of when. Before radiation, or after. It\u2019s been quite a year for me. Never been sick before, not like this definitely a new normal. Keep the faith lad",

It\u2019s good to be done with chemo, but it\u2019s not done with me yet, that is for sure. I do have some lingering neuropathy in my feet and the tops of my fingernails. But sometimes my feet feel like bricks. Doesn\u2019t help that the weather here is cold cold snow snow cold cold. I had some swelling in my legs, they did a Doppler but there are no blood clot\u2019s which is great. The compression socks combined with the very very thin skin on my feet and the neuropathy are hellish. Anyone else having lingering affects? I\u2019m still very fatigued. I\u2019m powering through as much as I can at work, but I\u2019m weary, so weary Went to a different heart surgeon and he told me that we can just monitor my ascending thoracic aneurysm for now. That kicked the radiation to the front of the line. I will be starting that for 28 treatments +5 boosters a week from Monday. That\u2019s all I got ladies, except I want to extend a big thank you to all of you here. Your attention, compassion, and answers were so comforting. I honestly came to value them much more overtime than the evasiveness I got from my healthcare providers. I will pop back in from time to time and will definitely join the January radiation thread.

It was scary, especially when the chemo nurse sat next to me with that giant tube of \u201cred devil\u201c. I think the hardest part of the chemo after that was the steroids. They made me feel very odd. I can compare it to is \u201ctripping\u201c back in the day, that kind of speedy feeling that you can't wait until it's over. For the most part I'm doing good though staying hydrated eating saltines and Lorna Doones every now and then. I can't really focus that great, I found an old Sergio Leone Western and the slow pace in the wide open spaces are comforting. I might count myself lucky, but I know this party is just beginning. Wanderweg- your surgery complications are heartbreaking. I know how it is to get different information from different doctors. You just want to know next steps. I'm sorry that this is such a bad patch for you. KK and Beeline- i'm digging the esoteric thread. I too am feeling changed forever. I've never really been sick before, no surgeries, very happy, pragmatic and strong- been a nonprofit gal for 30 years. I love my life and I love making a difference, and now I feel broken, no longer sturdy, delicate, weak. It's been a hard trying to stay sharp and perceptive throughout this journey. It's ironic that we have to make so many important decisions while under this type of pressure. And part of me resents The consumerism that surrounds it. I never knew all that much about breast cancer, pretty much just broad strokes, now digging through all the information is quite daunting, particularly when many of the topics that come up in my feed our ads for breast cancer related products and services. Good discussion on the pros and cons of THC. When I can focus a little take a look at some research as well. Tigerlily I too am a fan of the melatonin. I typically take it several times a week. I use a different brand but I will check out your link. So I'm starting to get this really funky taste in my mouth, so I'm going to get off the electronics and chew some gum as apparently I can't do these two things simultaneously. 🤪 at this point in time Maybe I'll post again a little later if I have a sleepless night Love and blue light all around",

My worst side effect is honestly been the constipation and this weird thing that\u2019s going on with my eyes- yeah that got so bad this week that I couldn\u2019t wear anymore Ieye make up- my eyes were super puffy and crows Was wearing these giant Jackie O sunglasses to work.

I\u2019m going proactive on the constipation it\u2019s bizarre how many products there are out there but I\u2019m hoping to get a handle on it this time. The Eye thang may have more to do with the steroids. The MO tweaked my AC cocktail yesterday and cut my after treatment steroids in half. We\u2019ll see how this goes. I\u2019m going to go see the ophthalmologist this week anyway. I had some very dense reports to do at work this week and it really kicked my ass vision wise. Fighting valiantly to keep my eyebrows. Finally got my prescription for my prosthetic breast. I went in and I guess I never really realized that I have such Ginormous breasts whoops breast. The bra that she had in stock fits really well but my god it\u2019s so much bigger than what I ever wore before. I was always a 36 or a 38 double D and now she\u2019s got me wearing and 40 triple D. I don\u2019t really mind but i feel whistful for those days of fun push up bras of the many colors. I mean the bra and the off-the-shelf prosthetic are way more comfortable than what I ordered online and they look good too, just a little too 1950s lift and separate. That\u2019s all for me. Reading back your posts makes me realize what good and courageous company I\u2019m in. Best to everyone. Here\u2019s hoping that week ahead is gentle  ",

Towards the end I was hot flashing and had a rash on my throat. But they gave me some more steroids and everything seemed OK. I think I\u2019m getting towards the tipping point now that Ive been in chemo for nearly 2 months now. I feel like I\u2019m kind of a ghost. This too shall pass I imagine Wanderweg-Beeline-You are right about protocols varying from region to region. I often wish I was in a warmer fuzzier place than Chicago land. It\u2019s pretty old-school here. If I wasn\u2019t nearly finished with my chemo, three more treatments, I might change MOs-He\u2019s been really kind of a jerk the last few times I\u2019ve seen him. He even rubbed my boyfriend the wrong way this last time which was pretty out of the ordinary. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re moving forward with your ankle surgery. Do any of you feel like you\u2019re completely a hostage to the situation? Earlier on someone told me that you can\u2019t control what\u2019s going on in your life after a cancer diagnosis, all you can do is try to manage it. Thats what I\u2019ve been trying to do with mixed success. I agree on the sex thing. Number one it\u2019s hard to even look in the mirror let alone feel desirable- honestly I don\u2019t even feel like this is my real body anymore, not really in tune with that at all. My guy is wonderful and so so patient, so I try and show up for sex for his sake every couple of weeks. It is what it is. But this too shall pass- I just keep telling myself to break this into small pieces. I think it\u2019s the only way I can really move forward. Any advice on neuropathy? Don\u2019t like anything pressing down on the top of my feet. Doesn\u2019t really hurt but it\u2019s like it\u2019s on the edge of pain.

I too am so saddened by losing my hair, but it\u2019s a cold comfort to be able to make that choice rather than going through The shedding process. KK I haven\u2019t noticed any increased sensitivity at my Masectomy site But i\u2019ve been seeing a lymphedema therapist regularly. She is wonderful and the massage is great. The strengthening routine has helped me immeasurably. I\u2019m sorry to hear about people having allergic reaction\u2018s and colds-It\u2019s so hard to track these many side effects. It seems once You get a handle on one another one Rolls right up. So in my chemo world the dental saga culminated today in having the broken tooth extracted. Honestly having teeth pulled is a hard-core childhood fear of mine. I saw a very scary orthodontist back in the 70s. Just think \u201cLittle shop of horror\u2018s\u201c all dressed up in the 70s regalia. This may be the reason why my teeth are a bit jacked. I do go in periodically for dental work but typically only when I\u2019m on the verge of an emergency. I even like this dentist- he\u2019s pretty awesome, never makes me feel bad for not coming regularly, and is kind of cute. Telling thing is he didn\u2019t even recognize me when he came in to do the work. I guess the chemo etc. has taken it\u2019s toll. I had to go in yesterday to the MOs Office to get labs in order to move forward with seeing the dentist. Labs were good so the dentist went ahead and took one look at the tooth and said he had to pull it. It was funny it really didn\u2019t phase me. I guess I have a new definition of fear. Anyway he was truly sweet and waived my co-pay. Very kind. I\u2019m supposed to go in for my second round of AC tomorrow and I\u2019m a little freaked. I\u2019ve been reading up about the healing process of a pulled tooth it\u2019s all about platelets etc. And a lot of posts online say that many on MOs will wait at least three days to let the mouth begin to heal. I kind of think my oncologist is going to want to go ahead with the chemo tomorrow. He\u2019s pretty old school. I mean obviously they\u2019ll do my labs first but I have this terrible fear that The labs will look good and they will go ahead with the chemo and sometime on Sunday or Monday I\u2019m going to have some big bad trouble with my mouth. Infection or what not. Not sure if I should be really vocal tomorrow after my labs. I know the squeaky wheel gets the grease but Part of me doesn\u2019t want to delay. So many scary decisions. I\u2019m just really tired I guess Fairchild I feel you about reasons why we are on the specific cocktails, even more so there are times when I feel like there is this cookie-cutter approach to women with our diagnoses. It\u2019s like we\u2019re at a great disadvantage because it is so medically complex to navigate through. I mean I\u2019m no dummy but it still makes my head spin. In Any case thanks for the continued support ladies. If anyone has any sage advice I would truly appreciate it- vanilla ice cream is on the menu for dinner tonight. I guess that\u2019s a small silver lining.    ",
