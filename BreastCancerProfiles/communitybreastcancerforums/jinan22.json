      "Content": "jinan22 wrote: Dear all , For all who are ER + and taking antiestrogen.... i read in a recent article that cancer cells switch into a survival mode that normal cells also use when faced with starvation, It's called macroautophagy - autophagy means \"self eating\" - and within a week, breast cancer cells can reorganize component parts, degrade non-essentials and live in this state until antiestrogen therapy is stopped or the cells mutate and resume proliferation in the presence of tamoxifen. \"It's like taking your foot off of the gas pedal of your car,\" Adding a macroautophagy inhibitor promoted robust cell death. \"We believe targeting the autophagosome function will significantly improve the efficacy of hormonal treatment for estrogen-positive breast cancer,\" says the researcher. She recently received a three-year, $1.1 million National Cancer Institute grant to pursue that strategy. if u want to read the rest of the article .... heres the link... i didn't get the point of this way of killing cancer cells so any one here could explain more.... thanks hope all research will be useful from now on....
