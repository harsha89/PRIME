Now 2 years later waiting for the test results on that \"good\" breast.  Thought it would be easier this time around.. but ya know what? it isn't. I am slowly melting. Everytime the phone rings my hands begin to shake and I  time travel to 2 years ago when I heard the news the first time over the phone. My 10 year old is home today from school as they have a snow day. I am worried the call will come, won't be good and I don't want my 10 year old to see me upset. I hate this Leslie  Log in to post a reply",

I lost my Mom to this disease when I was 12( she was 36) it is hard to watch my 10 year old feeling the same feelings I had so long ago He holds on to me extra tight... Told me I didn't need  any breasts.. that I was beautiful without them.. He can touch my heart like no other Thanks you again for all your warmth and compassion. it helps the fear Hugs L  shelia.. you are in my thoughts and prayers for B9 diagnosis. We can hold each other hands :) ",

I have been having some pain in that breast so the doc said wait until the  biopsy area  heals enough and see if I still feel it. I have no rash, inverted nipples, discharge or any other symptom  except for occasional pain.   Relieved yet still worried.  Anyway thanks for all of your support. I appreciate it so much and it helped me immensely. I really wish now I would have had the double mastectomy so I wouldn't have to worry. Hindsight huh? You are all in my prayers.. Leslie ",
