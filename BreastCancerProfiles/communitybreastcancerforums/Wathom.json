I was dx earlier in the year, am premenopausal and had a 17 oncotype score. At the time, I was not encouraged to have chemo. This study changes things. I am very concerned that when I see my oncologist in a month, she is going to recommend it. This study is good for a lot of people but not women who were advised against chemo, had stage 1, no node involvement, er/pr+, her2-, premenopausal and had an intermediate oncotype score. As I understand it, taking Tamoifen alone puts me at a 14% recurrence rate. With Chemo and then tamoxifen it's 8%.",

Had I known what I know now, I would have had a pbmx, Having said that, my younger self likely wouldn't have done that!  I find it hard being a 2 time cancer survivor before I'm 50. Most people can't even begin to relate, Glad to have people who understand. :)",
