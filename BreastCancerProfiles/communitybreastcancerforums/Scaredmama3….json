While I don't have many encouraging words, being that I might still be in a state of shock myself, I wanted to let you know that I am here. This place has truly been a blessing to me during such a dark time in our lives. I don't know why but seeing that you are 35 as well gave me some strange peace. (  of course I would rather you not have it, but taking comfort that we are the same age) I figured you might like knowing that about me as well!  One thing that I have finally convinced myself of is that this is NOT a death sentence, we will get through this. I am stage 1 grade 1 and just last week I took the test for those genes as well along with a whole panel of other genes. It scares the crap out of me but I must find out for the sake of my kids! Deep breaths....",
