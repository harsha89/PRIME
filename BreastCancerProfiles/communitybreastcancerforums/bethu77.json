I am doing the expanders with reconstruction. I got the results from my Oncotype testing and I need chemo. I don't have a start date yet. My oncologist wanted to start me on 10/24 but I have my first fill of the expanders that week and can handle only one thing at a time! How do each of you feel about your decision to have chemo? Did you have a choice to make? I don't want a recurrence because this is my second time. My first was bilateral DCIS with surgery and radiation in 9/08. I am so scared of the whole chemo thing!",

I was first diagnosed with DCIS in 2008, I had bilateral lumpectomies and radiation as my treatment. In 2011, I was diagnosed again and had bilateral mastectomies and treated with chemotherapy.I had expanders put in and my implants put in 2012. In December of last year, i found a small lump (like a pimple) on my right implant. The biopsy showed breast cancer again. My implant was removed but I continued to have small lumps. I was treated with radiation and the treatment plan had to be changed three times. As a result, I had the top layer of my entire chest area radiated. I continue to have lumps appear. My onc has said I have metastatic breast cancer. I am now receiving navelbine. Shewwwwww, after all this, my question is this, does anyone on this thread have these bumps? I have an ugly cluster on the top of my left implant and they hurt. If no one has them, can you tell me if you know of a thread that can help me?  Thanks in advance for any help. ",

I will go to the Dr's office to have the wires put in then go to the hospital for the surgery. I am having reconstruction immediately after. This is considered outpatient surgery so I will be home by 5. I am anxious and wish it was done and over with. I had a cry day yesterday after seeing the plastic surgeon and several times today, I have teared up. My sister has told me that it is okay to cry to her. I don't have to be strong around her. She told me everyone has told her I am taking the news well. I work in a public area and I can't be crying at my desk. I fall apart when it is convenient. I learned today that I don't always have to be strong. I have decided that this is my time to focus on me. My birthday is August 25 and I'll be 49. I am going to have a great b'day party before I have surgery. Everyone hang in there and keep posting. This list is what has kept me going and excited for my future! Thanks everyone and God Bless!!! ",
