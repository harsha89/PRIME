I am VERY nervous and scared, but I keep telling myself that everything will be ok and I am doing this not only to save my life, but so that I can see my children grow up. I am TN as well, grade 3, but my tumor was 9cm. I had 4 rounds of Taxotere and CytoxinÂ  to shrink it (it is now 3.2cm ). I will have 2 more rounds of chemo post surgery with 6 weeks of rads. Good luck to you Dragonfly and I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",
