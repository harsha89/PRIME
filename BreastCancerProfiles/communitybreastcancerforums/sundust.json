Fox who said that fearing the worst-case scenario means that if it happens, you lived it twice. Enjoy your life! Second: I totally hear you on the Cancer Center thing. I'm not proud to admit this, but one factor in my choice of surgeon and oncologist was that they were not based in the Cancer Center. (The biggest factor was that they were excellent. Super-excellent.) When I had to go there for radiation treatment, every time I went in I felt like the building labeled me a Sick Person. I've never been back there for a check-up since completing radiation. (I do follow up regularly with my oncologist and surgeon.) So I get it. It's not logical but I get it. I hated that place and felt quarantined away from the regular, normal hospital. Could hospitals please stop creating \"Cancer Centers\" as monuments to this disease, and just start treating people like normal patients with other issues?",

If I were in your shoes, I would do all of the things that those who get diagnosed wish they had done before they were diagnosed. That would include eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and WATERCRESS (seriously, read the studies on this one)), plus garlic, onions, leeks, kale, cooked white-button and crimini mushrooms, green tea, organic red raspberries. There's a handy chart here that shows anti-cancer activity of different vegetables against different types of cancer. It's easy to see some common threads: http://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Anti-Cancer-Vegetables-Study.pdf Cut out refined sugar and refined carbs. Instead, consider making most of what you eat anti-cancer. If you want to treat yourself, there IS now healthy, delicious dessert. Check out Hail Merry chocolate Miracle Tarts, they are absolutely awesome and extremely rich so you will NOT crave other crap. Switch to organic dairy, and consider eliminating red meat or switching to clean, grass-fed organic meats. Get enough Omega 3 fats (flax oil and other sources), iodine and Vitamin D. It seems like a daunting checklist but if you switch gradually over a few months it'll just become a habit. There is delicious organic whole wheat pasta (I like bioNaturae) that is great with garlic/olive oil/butter or tomato sauce/organic parmesan. Consider rebounding on a trampoline as exercise if you think it sounds fun; like swimming, it exercises almost every part of your body and is great for the lymph system. For me, it's also a good excuse to blast great music and MOVE. Try to get enough sleep. Consider the 20 steps here: https://herbdocblog.com/book-view/12/ And enjoy your life!",

Having it removed does not sound like a terrible idea. Just make sure you try to slam the door on it afterward :-)",
