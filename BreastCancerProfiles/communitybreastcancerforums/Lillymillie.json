You have the added benefit of herceptin. I know a great lady who was diagnosed the same age as us, her son was 3 at the time. she had lots of lymph nodes involved and had a mast. In those days they didn't have herceptin but she is doing great and living life to the max. She focused on diet and excerise. Her son is now 15! Best of luck with your treatment x",

Z, I can hear the sadness in your post. Hormone treatment did not work for my bone mets so I had to do abraxane early on. Is it time for a chemo to hit it hard? That was interesting about your father's chemo experience, low dose doxil on a weekly format? I have nowhere near the knowledge you have. I have had abraxane which worked very well for 8 cycles (excellent quality of living on it too). In UK we seem to only do 6 or 8 cycles and stop. It is a drug that can be revisited as it did not fail. Ibrance/faslodex worked for 11months until diffuse liver mets showed. After a failed liver biopsy, waiting for a 2nd one. 6 weeks off treatment.

I had a long chat with my oncologist last night at his clinic. He is very experienced and answers all my questions indepth. I did want to get a gene mutation test from a very new UK company. He wasn't sure what help it would be. He got on the phone with their ceo during the week and asked for proofs and clinical trials about the added value they provide. They couldnt provide him with answers. He doesnt want me out of pocket for information that he can give me. He thinks as a last resort when we are down to very few options that he would only at that point use if for clinical trial info. I trust he is using treatments that and I know once he has proof of something of benefit he will make a case for it. I'm following the members on Y90 as he initially said I would not qualify. He was worried about liver damage/failure if used throughout. Again we may slower in UK but he will look the newer evidence. My thoughts are prayers are with everyone struggling today.",

I told him about my concerns about my periods returning and he said that 50% of women in my age group would see their periods return but Tamoxifen would do it's job. (90% of under 30s would see their return. He said he wouldn't recommend ooph for me. For some people he wouldn't hesitate...I don't know what he meant as I think I'd be a good canditate as Im highly er+ with large tumour and affected nodes. I went in to ask about ovary removal and to check about conceptives (I can't use coil for 5 years apparently after cancer. It has very low progesterone which should be okay as I was pr- but manufacturers reckon 5 years after breast cancer). Then I got a curve ball. He said if I was to fall pregnant I could just come off tamoxifen...What??? I thought all along that having another baby would cause my estrogen to raise and therefore be dangerous for me but he told me that he has seen a few younger women go on to have kids and new studies have shown that it only slightly effects your outcome. When he says effect, does that mean you could 'slightly' have a reoccurance or worse still 'slightly' die?? He is saying if you are going to have a reoccurance you will and getting pregnant won't really increase your chance. (I think he said Oxford study). My head was spinning at this stage. I thought another child was out of the question with my situation. My latest scans all looked good and he was happy with everything. I'm UK based as this guy is well respected but I'm very confused when every other onc is saying something different. I'm wondering if he just has to follow the guidelines in front of him regardless of what may be benefical for me or maybe I don't tick enough boxes for ooph. I left really reassured and happy but when I read these forums I being to worried that I'm not doing enough.",

I struggle to understand the technical numbers bit as I know nothing about this yet. A interesting turn of events yesterday. Went in for my liver biopsy. My ct/Mri showed shadow. Pet confirmed diffuse small liver mets across liver. When the other expert radiologist my onc wanted to do biopsy looked on ultrasound, he could not see the spot he wanted to biopsy. He said that my left lobe looks a little shriveled and scarred but it is not disease as the others thought. It is damage from previous chemo more likely. There are some tiny spots on right side. Nothing he can see to biopsy. He is ordering a 2nd ct scan with a more detailed contrast dye. He said that the PET lit up more areas but he thought that it have exaggerated disease and it was more inflammation that disease. I still have liver disease but less is better than more! This is a test we are hoping to get is Oncologica. Its get sent to the science Village in Cambridge, England. (I like that they have a whole village working on cancer!) They make a bold claim about the world's most comprehensive DNA based cancer test https://www.oncologica.com/oncofocus/#who-will-ben... My onc says that it doesn't normally tell them anything new but sometimes throws in a treatment option they wouldn't normally consider. May flag up some thing for immunotherapy in future. He is talking about Xeloda or weekly taxol. He is leaning towards xeloda as it will be an easier treatment for me. He told me not to underestimate how powerful this drug can be. I know Wendy has had great success but I'm not sure if I should go blast it with taxol. I told him about Wendys 5cm tumour reducing to specks. He said he has patients who habe more cancer than me do very well on it. Also I have been off treatment (IF) since end of January waiting on biopsy and scans. So worried about no treatment at the moment! Hope you do well in Japan Z. I feel I should be writing cancer notes and travel notes too. Sounds like a fascinating place! Edited to fix all my typos!!",

I know most people names and yes lately there has been a lot of bad news. This is such an awful disease, it is hard not to take it personal. One Inspiring lady I follow over in UK has been told she has no options. I cried most of last weekend uncontrollably. I do delight in the positive stories and jot down notes of interesting info like the above info on different scans. Life is busy. Your family members need to at the moment. You are not superwoman! Everyone feels behind in what they have to accomplish. Even in full energy mode I rarely get there. Don' be so hard on yourself. It's nice to get lost in tv and let your brain switch off for a while (tv is in its golden age they say!) I do have park bc and normal family life resumes. I come here to read and when I do post someone always acknowledges me or advises. That's what is great about this community, I think everyone understands how you feel xx",

Okay I didn't know about hypermobolic activity. I will look into that. My onc has previously consultated with a very respected UK leading mbc consultant and this time he has said he will consult a liver specialist for their advice. I have one in mind. I will read up on TACE and Y90 and see how they can work on diffuse areas.",

I was originally diagnosed when he was just over a year old. He has no memory of my first treatment. I was diagnosed with bone mets there in April. Was on arimidex and had progression in first couple of months. Was hoping I could just take hormone tablets and go along as normal without saying anything. Unfortunately ive had to start Abraxane chemo. Will lose my hair next week. We are just wondering how to tell our son about my treatment with frightening him. We were thinking that we were going to say I have a disease in my bones and the doctors are giving me very strong medicine to help me and they are doing their very best. He will ask if I'm going to die but obviously I don't want to get into all that yet. I can just see him being so anxious and it breaks my heart that his childhood will be marred by my cancer. I have an incredibly supportive husband and we are a tight unit of 3. Just wondering how you guys have spoken to your children about cancer. Anything that has helped them deal with this.",
