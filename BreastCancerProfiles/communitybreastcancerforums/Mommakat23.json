Lady giving ultrasound said it was just routine, nothing to worry about. Then got called back for biopsy. Doctor doing biopsy stated that the reason I was there is because while gray and white show cyst, this was black and showed mass ( my colors could be wrong lol). She said good thing is the borders look smooth. And it's small. 2 mm I think. She gave me the 80 percent talk, but still it's hard to not let your brain go to the dark side. Now 3 to 5 days is going to go by really slow! I can use any prayers and good thoughts. By the way. The biopsy was not bad at all! Log in to post a reply",
