      "Content": "RockMamaof2 wrote: Hello everyone, First I want to say how comforting it has been to find this forum, and what a strong amazing group you are! I am a 32 yr old mother of two boys ages 6 & 8 (didn't breastfeed, tried, but they wouldn't latch). I drink on weekends, and used to smoke a pack a day until last January, still smoke maybe 2 packs a month (smoke when I drink) and am about 70 lbs overweight but pretty active and working on that. About a month and a half ago I was having pain in my left arm, a few weeks ago I noticed a sometimes pain in my left breast that would be in different areas around the nipple, or in the nipple. It hurt more when I pressed on it. (I have since noticed I get a similar but not quite as noticeable pain I my right breast occasionally).Went to doc for the arm pain (didn't mention breast, it was around my period), got referral for an EMG, suspected nerve damage. Last week I noticed the breast pain/tenderness was not going away, not getting worse, just still there. Went to general doc (actually an physicians assistant) said he felt a lump in the upper quadrant of left breast near armpit. That area and my armpit were tender to the touch. He told me to avoid caffeine (I don't drink soda and am a 1 cup a day coffee drinker) and chocolate and prescribed Naproxen. He also referred me for a Digital Diagnostic Mammogram and Ultrasound (actually he only ordered the ultrasound, the imaging center said I had to get a mammogram because I am over 30. The soonest I could schedule my tests is next Tuesday. I am terrified. I can't stop crying. I haven't been able to eat since yesterday. I am so so scared of missing out on my boys growing up. I am worried my arm pain means it has spread to the bone. My mom (I'm adopted) passed from BC when I was 12. I don't want my boys to go through what I did. I haven't been able to definitivley find the lump. Sometimes I feel one sometimes three and all hurt when pressed. My upper back/neck has been hurting on and off for months and now im worried that's related. I'm so sorry to be all over the place, my mind is going in all directions. I have anxiety already (in therapy since January), and have been under stress (we just bought a house). I get yearly physicals, had a clear breast exam (by hand at doc) last November, and recently (5/28) had full blood work and a chest X-ray due to the left arm pain. A week is so long to wait. I don't know if it's my gut or my anxiety that is screaming at me that it's cancer. I've always thought I had lumpy breasts. I hope I'm just connecting dots that aren't there. Any advice is very much welcome! Sorry for rambling, thank you for giving me somewhere to say this. Log in to post a reply",

All I can picture is a doctor giving me the bad news and having to tell my husband/kids/family and friends. Keeping my fingers crossed, could really use and positivity/prayers/good thoughts! Thank you all!",
