It was not until I went to get a second opinion on my newly diagnosed cancer that my new doctors identified 'cyst' as malignant tumor plus one more malignant tumor.  Also, my old doctor was calling me at home to discourage me from getting a second opinion. The amount of incompetent and dangerous doctors is staggering.   Go to the best and always get a second opinion.     Dx 1/16/2009, ILC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 1/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I was wondering if you have any personal ideas or beliefs as to what, if anything, could have contributed to the return of the disease in your case. And, is there anything you are doing beyond taking prescription medications that helps you fight this terrible disease and makes you better.",
