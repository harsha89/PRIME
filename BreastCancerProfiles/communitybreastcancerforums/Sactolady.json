Maybe you already belong to it. It is a closed group that you can join to help with surgery decisions, a list of surgeons, questions to ask, going through surgery, & post-surgery advice. The female-to-male surgery is different than a BMX and this has been discussed in the group, too. The ladies are very supportive of each other. I have the book \"Flat\" too, if you would like to read it. I can mail it free to you. Best wishes to you, Alison ",
