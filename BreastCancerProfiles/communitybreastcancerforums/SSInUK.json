Outfield - I understand some of your trouble. When I was first diagnosed I was introduced to a local lady with a kid at my kids school who had I was told been through BC two years before. It was only on meeting her that I discovered to my shock she was stage 4 from the outset. To my shame I avoided her for ages, I just wanted to meet survivors not those who hadn't made it as I then thought of it. I felt shitty and selfish like you but I couldn't face her. But her gentle kindness & understanding of my path gradually got through to me and now she has become a dearly beloved friend. Firstly, she has given me in the end courage rather than fear. I see what she has achieved and i know stage 4 BC need not be immediate tragedy. Second, I have a sense that if I have to walk into that vale of fear there's a hand to hold. And thirdly, her diagnosis has receded in my mind - it's actually her I really like in the end, disease or no disease. Forgive yourself - give it time - and she will hopefully become herself again in your head, not a fearful symbol.",

Your wife's diagnosis and history is EXTREMELY similar to mine -size nodes cheno response - and including s finding in an internal mammary node. Can I ask about her reconstruction plan? Autologous reconstruction (ie Diep) involves surgery in which internal mammary nodes CAN be reached and resected. Alternatively radiation is a viable option but you want the very best. Do they have Proton beam at your centre? This can target something the size of a node very precisely. There are centres which have specifically tackled nodes in the chest in this way. If not proton can they in any case target a more intense dose to the area they saw? I have researched these nodes extensively. Treatment is very important but there is encouragement to be found for example in this study, in which radiotherapy to the area for affected women seems to have been very effective: : https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/19/9/1553/... if you are seeking a second opinion my finding was that the centre with the greatest interest and research into IM nodes is MD Anderson. The kind radiation prof there gave me a second opinion and worked with my hospital to make a plan. Finally she seems to be eminently eligible to join one of the Ibrance trials. It is a very exciting drug with some amazing results in some stage 4 women and now being trialled in stage 3 - do look into it - could be her magic bullet. Wishing you all love and luck, I'm so sorry for the awful way this has happened to you both",

I was horrified to discover after surgery il that in fact I had 5cm in the breast and 5 nodes positive. My cancer was strongly hormone positive and my MO said further chemo would not help. He was not concerned about the residual disease in the breast but he didn't like the positive nodes as that generally represents the cancer that is most aggressive and moving around - they want to see that stuff respond. However all the residual disease was classed as grade1 / low grade 2 which is not chemo responsive but 'should respond well' to hormone therapy. These situations are nuanced - it might be worth asking them to look at the Ki67 on the residual disease. If it is high then a conversation about further chemo is reasonable . If it is low take comfort from that and move on to hormonals. That's what we did when they found more disease in my IM nodes. However as you will see from my other thread I am looking at possibilities such as Ibrance. You may be a very good candidate for the PENELOPEB trial aimed at women with residual ER+ disease after chemo. My MO is a super expert on ER+ BC and he thinks Ibrance is v promising.",

Ladies for our own self-advocacy they are called this not 'intramammary' nodes, which are within the breast itself. Disease was found in my internal mammary nodes after rads that did not include this area and much research has led me to feel very strongly ALL stage 3 women should be considered for rads to this area as the chance of having involved nodes is up to 40%. Modern radiotherapy at a sophisticated centre will NOT damage your heart. Mom of twins - I know you angst about no more treatment but my friend who had multiple mets in her spine became NED and stable for 3 years and counting on tamoxifen alone. Woohoo for anti hirmonals!!!! Momy4ever - gentle hugs, you are having a hard time. It is possible your inc may still think anti hirmonals are relevant for you - and I agree, push for more treatment or other opinions. Finally the whole issue of response to NAC is so complex. Having a 'poor' prognosis relative to those with PCR is very relative. They may have a 95% chance of cure - but some will relapse. And look at this from this end - if you gave chemo to what my onc friend calls 'little old lady cancer' - which is 100% ER/PR, no involved nodes, Grade 1 - it woulld NOT get to a PCR. Yet the likelihood of relapse is very small. As for the RCB index - I strongly suggest you don't go there. Momoftwins I don't think that link will be helpful to most here. Your post chemo stats were much more favourable than most of us who are still stage 3 post NAC chemo. I ran the RCB numbers a year ago and went to a dark place for a long time. For most on this thread those particular numbers will look grim. We know we had a lot of disease - we know we still had it after chemo - Nuff said. And the oncs told me the RCB concept is very undeveloped and studies way too limited I suggest RCB comes under the heading 'don't Google' - it offers nothing in relation to treatment options, just horrible statistics. My onc friend said she'd seen many women do just fine without the big response to chemo. I hold onto that. And we read the stories of survival with multiple nodes on this forum and see a much more positive picture.",

Eight months later they found some positive nodes just outside the field treated and I had rads again to that area with the breath hold technique nearly a year after the first round. We all believed that was worth doing so it put a new perspective on wait times for me. My top tip - make sure they're going to include your Internal Mammary nodes. They will at MD Anderson, they advised my team in the UK how to retreat the area. Not everyone does - though I think guidelines are changing so they will in future. Good luck and take care of yourself during rads it can be hard on some people",

It scared me as I have hoped AIs would be my magic bullet, since no other treatment seemed to do its job. I had lots of residual disease after NAC and more cancer found in IM nodes 9 months after mastectomy, chemo rads. I understand AIs are stopping your body fat making estrogen and presumably the more body fat you have the less completely effective they are. Gulp. Of course the anxiety makes me want to hit the valentines chocolate. Not helpful.. Btw I have read some studies about estrogen levels of women on AI's and BMI but a couple of pounds over weight is outside the scope of the literature I'd say. Blimey. That's hardly overweight in my books, given the damn hormone therapy itself can make weight a problem.Harsh!!",

I am told auto-immune thyroid disease is common in middle aged women - plus there's a lot of speculative literature linking it to breast cancer incidence and/or treatment.  Whatever the truth of this, starting thyroxin is at least giving me some hope my body will start working better, and motivation to do whatever I can to help that process.   As per my previous post, my onc disagrees with those who say letrozole doesn't work as well if you're heavy - however he agrees weight is a risk factor.  Good luck to anyone struggling with this too.     ",

How could it not be with all my cancer untouched by both chemo and tamoxifen? But - all clear. For now. Breathe - your mind and imagination are not necessarily your best friends right now. You know appetite could as easily be the stress... Praying for good results for you. Bone scan is a great result so far. Like you - part of me fears its inevitable it will show up again one day.

It's also amazingly common for the response that scans report not to match the final pathology. It's oftenvery hard to tell what's what..Your Onc may have told you that only a very very few ladies with hormone positive cancer get a complete response to chemo but that doesn't mean all is lost. Finally I've been told that while some tumours shrink from the outside in so they get smaller, some are attacked in a 'Swiss cheese' pattern. The overall tumour bed stays the same same size but cells die out across it. Courage. Progression on chemo is very rare. Lending you strength",

Brilliant thing, a post BC friend gave me and she was dead right! 2. Get people to visit. Everyone whose offered help or interest - ask them to come. Don't lie in bed alone thinking when your body is a bit beat up. 3. Totally with Netflix series - if you haven't seen it The Good Wife will get you all through recovery!!! 4. Juicing makes you feel like you're putting health back in your body and if you do it in something like a nutribullet the roughage helps more than anything with post op constipation. 5. Be prepared for it to suck somewhat - lack of sensation, change in the feeling of your body - it's all difficult stuff. But many have gone before you and live with it fine it will get a whole load better. Momy4ever - very good to hear you're having Xeloda that makes sense. You have to heal before rads - but not delay too much for the implants. In the end they may not be your final solution of rads affects them. There are actually a bunch of studies about good results with doing RT with implants deflated, filling them after. Houston that sounds horrible. I think what you're using is am the right stuff - just keep it going and give it time. If it's any comfort people with a response line yours seem to heal completely. Oddly I had less soreness but have seemingly permanent darkening of the skin all over the area. The longest effect is likely to be stiffness as it settles - ask for some good Physio as you recover / it really helps say 6 months out. Humbling to think that of all women in all human history, we have way better chances than any women who ever lived and suffered this",

Your centre may be brilliant - but in any case make sure you have input from someone with IM node interest and experience. My hospital in the UK is exceptional supposedly one of the best in Europe - but there was no one there with a research interest in this area. It's not a small thing. If it lit up on a PET remain vigilant. You can treat the area without Proton using VMAT. The italian study I sent you also details an approach. Sorry this I sent all so complex it sucks",
