Collectively, your post and your attitude remind me of the Shakespeare quote that has brought me SO much focus & composure in the past 9days since my Mamma dignosed - 'Cowards die many deaths but the valiant die but once'.   And honey? Whilst don't know you I'm sooooo thinking your attitude and your new treatment may well gift you many more such beautiful days as clearly you have much to focus on, and very def fall into the valiant camp. Sending you thanks for the gift of sharing, hugs, a hug for your l'il girl who has made this stranger smile, and of course, love, & titanium x",
