I have yet to have a follow up with the internist or rheumatologist yet but will keep you posted about any successful treatment. I have however, started treatment with a private physiotherapist. For anyone in the Ottawa area, Haley Physiotherapy specializes in cancer patients pre & post op & treatment. I have felt very reassured & hopeful with recovery since my first visit. I didn't know there was such a thing so I'd suggest to check out if there is someone in your area who does the same. Ive received massage, dry needling, laser therapy for scarring & muscle pain as well as knowdgeable advice for therapeutic exercise & even garments to wear to help with lymphedema. Please keep me posted with any success you have dealing with lupus also. Take care",

I had stage 2 bc, mastectomy, act taxil chemo followed by neuropathy, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis & fibromyalgia. I have recently moved & different dr care & testing is saying there is no rheumatoid but rather lupus. I believe strongly that this is caused from the chemo & was an immediate side effect incorrectly diagnosed but is now lasting 2 years. I don't know much about lupus, how to manage or rid myself of it. If anyone has experiences or advice, I'd very much appreciate you sharing. Log in to post a reply",
