I enjoy mixing up running with step, muscle training, weight lifting, pilates. the dvds are cheaper than a gym and you can do them in your own home in your underwear if you want to LOL. My physical strength and stamina has also gone up and my weight has gone down. Just running is boring and its not so good for your body to do the same thing all the time.",

I hate waiting and sometimes I think the medical profession is so insensitive to how agitated we all become when we are in limbo. Best of luck and prayers to all you and your family members who are waiting for results. I'll ask you all to pray for my daughter who has her liver ultrasound Wednesday, some of you may know she was adopted from China 16 years ago and just found out that she has Hepatitis C. Thank God she donated blood or we might not have found out till she was very ill. So far she is healthy and brand new drugs have come out so we are encouraged. I am praying her liver is in good shape so far.",

When you go before the judge, make sure you say that it is in the best interests of the children to have a stable home environment. Make sure you throw in that it is not in their best interest to be exposed to drug use and an uncertain living situation. I know you would do that anyway but judges respond well to the phrase \"best interests of the children\". You can PM me if you have any questions and I will do my best to help you. Marsha (maywin)",

I realized that sue is ok now and her post was three years old. Now I am reading Cathi's posts....Cathi I am a lawyer and if I were licensed in FL I would work for you free. Since I'm not, I can advise you to talk to a private attorney about getting custody. It seems to me you have a fantastic case. Again, I'm not in FL so don't know the laws there, but it's about the bests interest of the children in almost all states. This isn't a grandparents rights case....they are not trying to keep the kids from you. This is a case about the proper custodial persons.",
