It also seemed swollen, and was very sensitive to touch.  I don't believe there was any infection. I was advised to stop the weights, which I reluctantly did.  It took 3 months for the port to settle.  Even though I was still on the clinical trial, I asked to have the port removed. I had the port removed on May 14.  I was very nervous about getting it removed as I felt that there was a lot of scar tissue around it.  It was actually not that bad to get it out.  The surgeon that removed was extremely rough, and I was bruised all around that part of the chest for 2 to 3 weeks.  Even now it is still healing.  I continue the clinical trial chemo until August and was told that my peripheral veins would work fine for the remaining few treatments, and I have had already 2 treatments peripherally. I am very glad to have the port out, and I am hoping to start my weights again once the port is healed completely.  My feeling is that if the port is bothering you and you have good peripheral veins for blood draws, then get it removed as soon as you can.  Good luck to you!",
