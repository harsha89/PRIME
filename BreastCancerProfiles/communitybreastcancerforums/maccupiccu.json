She does know of the situation my mom is in and she told me flat out \"it's not her concern.\" So much for helping. We tried getting her in a SNF and that just fell apart. She hated it. I can't get her to live with me because 1) she can be verbally abusive and I have a 3 year old to protect 2) she just won't (I have stairs). So I'm in the middle.",

All seem to be treating her symptoms as if she is a very healthy person with pneumonia. I think she should have went to a different doc long ago but now that she's been established for 6 years, she won't change. She is someone who is very difficult to communicate with. At the hospital they were trying to help her understand different care options, etc. and they said that she's just extremely anxious/paranoid, not hearing what they are telling her, etc. I know this that's why getting her optimal care has been beyond words difficult.",

      "Content": "maccupiccu wrote: Hi, This is for my mom but I'm curious since the oncologist can't give us answers.  My mom has been fighting stage IV metastatic breast cancer (spine, spleen, liver) for 6 years with suprising results. This January, however, she acquired pneumonia and has never felt the same. The doc(s) said it takes time but I\"m seeing a huge difference in her demenor and quality of life (Before pneumonia--very mobile. After--very weak beyond words). She couldn't take chemo in Jan. due to low white cell count (and then got pneumonia). Now that she's feeling so bad, oncologist said take another month off. We went for her labs this past weekend to see where she is at with things but to me, I'm not so confident this is pneumonia recovery and even if so, what can we expect with a two month break from chemo? She was on zometa and navelbine. When I talked with a sub oncologist in the hospital asking if she stopped chemo what would happen, he said she would have weeks to a few months left. That sounds \"reasonable\" to me. But her own oncologist just leaves us with \"we don't know what will happen.\"  Any insight would help me understand and prepare. Log in to post a reply",

The bottom line barrier is that she's in a controlled, domestic violence situation with my dad. 1. home nurse--not allowed (at least not at this point; perhaps with hospice when things progress so badly that she has a week left to live and is unconscious) 2. psych meds--she won't take them. She has biases. Trust me, I want them both to be on meds. They need it.  3. pain meds--no because my dad wont' take her to the doc nor call the doc. They're putting it on me so I'm getting FMLA process in order. It's a sucky situation all the way around.",
