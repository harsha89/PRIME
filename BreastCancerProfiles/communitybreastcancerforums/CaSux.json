It's important to out Shockney as a non-expert for so many reasons - lack of understanding on LE being only one of them. I propose we few stop referring to Shockney as an expert and start referring to her as an \"expert.\"  Her credentials: an RN/BS degree and an M.A.S. degree - Master of Administrative Science - she has no advanced degree in medicine, psychology or counseling. The breast center website identifies her role as Administrative Director and describes her duties as \"surgical oncology and psychological supportive care needs.\"  What she does have is experience as a  breast cancer patient - which I think is not an insubstantial experience. Each of us here can call ourselves an expert of our own experiences. And so can she. Trouble with Shockney's \"expertise\" is she seems to define her own experience as the ideal - the gold standard - the experience which we should all be striving to attain. Additionally, her role at Hopkins, which again, is ADMINISTRATIVE, and her stated education, does not appear to qualify her to offer psychological counseling, which requires extensive advanced education and a LICENSE TO PRACTICE. No where is this more harmful than in her approach to \"psychological supportive care needs.\" She is on the record - in her books and writings with providing, to my admittedly layman's eye, actually PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARMFUL medical advice. Here's an example: \"if you take a fatalistic attitude though you can doom yourself so STOP DOING THAT.\" Shockney appears to assume that telling a person to STOP DOING THAT is an appropriate therapeutic response to what may likely be clinical depression. Here's another example: \"sounds like better communication needs to happen between you and your family. having left them out they may still be feeling bitter\u2026you SHOULD BE FEELING OPTIMISTICALLY and not be down in the dumbs (her typo, not mine) having become a survivor of this disease\" The patient's question appeared to me to be a cry for help, she sounded defeated and in tremendous psychological pain - and Shockney's response appeared to me to BLAME THE PATIENT for not being POSITIVE ENOUGH. NOWHERE DOES SHE SUGGEST THAT THE PATIENT SEEK COUNSELING!!!! This is serious stuff. I realize that the Hopkins 'Ask an \"Expert\"' site includes a disclaimer about not providing medical advice, yada, yada, yada - but so much of what the \"expert\" writes comes across as medical advice AND A BLATANT MARKETING OF HOPKINS BREAST CENTER - and I would say that psychological harm is some of the worst that can be inflicted on a person. No visible scarring - but the most difficult to overcome in many cases. Notably - there are no easy links to information about support groups or counseling on the Hopkins Breast Center website. Before they redesigned it the link for psychological counseling took you to the home page of the Kimmel Cancer Center - which had no easy to find links pointing to psychological counseling or support.  I don't know if the re-design has corrected this - I have no desire to waste any more time on that useless website. WHY ARE THERE NO SUPPORT GROUPS AT HOPKINS??? WHAT IS HOPKINS  DOING WITH THE AVON FOUNDATION GRANTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY OUTREACH & SUPPORT SERVICES? WHY DOES SHOCKNEY NOT DISCLOSE HER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST? She receives compensation, speaker fees and grants from device makers and drug companies - all of which she schills for. Sorry to highjack the LE topic to rage on this - but it's been brewing a long time. ",
