I have been shopping like crazy to be prepared, scheduled acupuncture, got my cold cap kit yesterday, and am off to CVS shortly to get my flu shot. I am leaving on my last work trip for a while today. Just seems surreal. If you have not seen them already the shopping lists posted are helpful.",

My IV the first time was in my hand after considering my arm. It was fine and no bruising, unlike the butcher job the intern did on surgery. My hand was bruised for weeks. Hang in there KK. It is nerve wracking but hopefully you will not have too many SE. Fingers crossed! I continue to feel good. Had a headache today but unrelated. I am trying to keep the liquids going but had a not as good couple of days so maybe that is why I got a headache. Drinking more water was an ongoing goal prior to all this. I am starting to lose hair, all over. Going to be a lot of vacuuming btw me and the dog. And today my scalp feels weird. Kind of itchy but not quite the same. I am exactly 2 weeks post round 1 so I guess it is time. We will see how the Paxman is. Of course, I am staying over in the city tomorrow night for some meetings and I am worried about suddenly loosing all my hair. I packed a wide head band that will cover a good portion of my hair in case I have a sudden massive loss. I continue to gently wash my hair most days, no hair dryer. And just a little organic hair spray so I don't look like alfalfa. Also, told my stepdaughter tonight. She is 10 and thankfully (at the moment) unobservant. She was not phased by all the flowers showing up at the house and with the summer schedule she missed the surgery and my first chemo. She took it all in and did not say much. Not sure how to react to that but at least it is out in the open. @pcranky, why did they reduce steroid? I have asked for more tapering. The neulasta commercial is on tv a lot tonight. I abhor pharmaceutical advertising.",

      "Content": "Nov 8, 2018 02:46PM - edited Nov 8, 2018 02:47PM by Tigerlily318 Hi all and a good welcome to you sunocean. Thank you all for the congrats on being PFC. I greatly appreciate it! I too am struggling with my looks and feelings of doubt but trying to be positive. I got married in January and I have thought many times, what if I'd been diagnosed before we signed on the line. I find myself trying not to complain to my husband too much about my hair, puffiness, etc. He says all the right things. Sometimes I feel like I'm not being honest with him by talking about it but I also feel that it is one of many relationships I have and pointing out that I feel bad about myself is not good for romance. I went for a sauna the other day and the woman thought I was in my early 30's (I'm 45). It was good perspective. I may look different to me, it doesn't mean I look like a horror show to everyone else, especially those that don't know me.  You all are so beautiful and kind hearted and I hope that everyone can appreciate it and that you have people in your life that tell you how beautiful you are. @beeline, congrats on the new job and keep trying to squash the negativity! @JNKK, I'm glad they think they figured it out. I have hated the steroids and was going to argue for less but I was glad to have them this last round.  @Piksie, uh oh about the food! I did read early on about pets and how to make sure I don't poison my dog and how to recognize if I do. But, I'm steadily made food and fed me and my husband throughout chemo. I just have kept washing my hands and using antibacterial stuff. We've probably consumed too much of that. But no one said anything to me about that. So I guess I wouldn't worry about it?  @beingpositive, good luck with you decision. I think it is hard either way. I am having radiation on the left side and there are techniques, protocols to protect the heart, so if you go that route, make sure you get specific radiation or that they can offer it. I am one week PFC. This round was much worse in some ways, better in others. Now that I finally have the hang of it! I slept a lot over the weekend and my brain malfunctions are worse. The fatigue is now much better. The rash in my mouth I'd been ignoring the last rounds because it was not that bad is back today like clock work, but I have prescription stuff (Ny something) that is helping. It's gross - tastes like banana and looks like bile - but working. My pain in my knees and shins was really bad. I finally stopped taking 8 aleve a day because it did nothing and I really think the magnesium worked. So, for any of you experiencing that, add magnesium twice a day. I went for my abdomen ultra sound last week and it became a vaginal one. That was awesome. Turns out I have three tiny fibroids, which may be why I had some pain. The recommended treatment is Lupron which I start 1/2. So that was good news all around, nothing to worry about. My eyelashes and eyebrows are starting to go....curious to see how much I lose. Probably all of it. No neuropathy.  Oh, and my cousin had her surgery. It remained DCIS and she got clean margins, so that was good news too..... Keep posting, hang in there, and this too shall pass.   ",

I didn't like them at first and they made me turn red but no rash. I think I got used to them. They did make me hungry, especially the following week. I also iced - only during the Taxotere. I've had no neuropathy so I'm thinking I'm out of the woods. I'm 2 1/2 weeks PFC. It'll be three weeks on Wednesday. I think my hair is growing. I still have the low grade headache, fuzziness, and the biggest things are general fatigue and muscle fatigue. My legs feel like I climbed Everest and sadly I have not.  Piksie, thank you so much for posting the article about the Taxanes! That is me! I asked my oncologist about muscle fatigue and knee pain and he said he had not heard of it - but he must have thought I was saying something else, maybe about the knee pain. I'm being seen at Mass General which the article references so I'm going to print and bring with me next time I see him, though that is not until January. I also wonder how much of the pain is also water retention. Any ideas anyone? I'm up 10 lbs since July/diagnosis but my clothes fit, so not sure what is up. I do have no more excuse for steroid eating. I got my tattoos and mapping for radiation last week. Easy. But I'm worried about ongoing fatigue with that since I still have it from chemo. We'll see, I still have two weeks to recover more.  JNKK, glad the rash situation is improved. You must be so relieved.  Have a good night and good start to the new week! ",

I have not used a blow dryer in almost 6 months BUT my make up routine has tripled in time as you all mention. I wear makeup to yoga! Even though the eyebrow pencil wears off (I hate the feel of the gel). Elizabeth and Sue, I rang the radiation bell today. The prep is not bad, and the tattoos don't hurt for more than a second. I found radiation more disruptive for my work schedule than chemo, but I felt better. At the moment I am realizing I have to work a full day tomorrow (from home) and that's making me unhappy. Sitting and focusing is hard. But I'm hoping it gets easier soon.  Hair obsession continues. I can go out in public with no hat (hooray) but don't look too close. And, I think my part is going to be on the opposite side because I lost a lot more hair on one side as opposed to the other.  Fairchild, good luck with going back to work! I bet (and hope) people will be super nice. That's my experience too. I also got a lot of talks from the doctors and nurses the last few days, now that I'm past chemo and radiation, about how it will take me a while to be back to normal and to be assertive about that. Folks may assume since I'm done with active treatment, I'm back to normal and that's not the case. I know that and expected it, but the better you look, the more I think folks think you're the same. And of course, you'll never be the same, but hopefully you can get the stamina back.  Stay healthy.....",

Wanderweg: you look beautiful. And wise. Fairchild, how are your GI issues? My trip to Honolulu has sucked. Cancer sucks. I had a great day on Friday, despite the jet lag. All my favorite things and I was in a fuck it, don't care how much it costs mood. Yoga, massage, a little shopping, walk, lunch, swim in the ocean, amazing dinner. Saturday I worked out and then we headed up to the North Shore and then my abdomen started to hurt. I've had this before - pre cancer - a few times. And had pretty bad pain a few days. After a few days of prilosec and tums it goes away. I never go a real diagnosis. Stupidly I kept eating. I was fine through Saturday but spent Sunday in a ball all morning and watched the Super Bowl outside at the hotel bar sipping water but made it through barely. NOTHING touched the pain. I did not eat between Sunday and Tuesday. The only symptoms are a little gas and horrible pain all around my upper torso, front and back. Now, finally on Thursday I can sit with no pain but it kills when I move. Like I did a million abs I didn't do or I was punched. I am eating yogurt, muffins, and smoothies and collagen water and making it through my meetings and sleeping. I'm guessing GERT or gastritis made worse by the chemo. I don't think it is the AI/OS or rads - too far out. And I have no idea what set it off except maybe too much to eat Friday night and too little sleep. Oh and my chronic cough I'd finally gotten rid of with my supplement regimen is back so maybe I did used to have acid reflux. So frustrating. I didn't get in touch with the doctors because I figured they'd start pointing me to the next one. I see my naturopath on Monday and my primary in two weeks and so forth so hope it gets better. My blood work from last week was all perfect. Anyone else? It just sucks. Inflamed stomach in Hawaii. No Poke. On a positive note my hot flashes, 3 months PFC and a month into AI/OS are pretty much gone....I have that going for me.",

I'm more worried about the Y - all the kids and a lot more people than the yoga studio. But, at the same time, my blood work and white counts are good. AT the Y I have been running into classes and then running out and just carrying hand sanitizer and using it. It makes your hands a little dry. I did have a Zumba instructor yell at me twice for not jumping yesterday. I had fun telling her why and educating her young self. Needless to say I won't be going back to that class.  @beeline, hear you on the bone pain. I am on Day #10 and it is now mostly in my knees. The oncologist NP says it could be the chemo (taxotere) and not the neulasta. She said to make sure I get plenty of electrolytes. So Smartwater will save us? I had some electrolyte tablets you put in water (Num brand)...I have no idea how they ended up in the house. But I have done that the last couple of days + coconut water and am doing less Advil.  I should share a picture of the chickens roaming my suburban neighborhood yesterday. Felt like I was back in Hawaii.  Good night all!",

We had a birthday party for my stepdaughter yesterday. My immediate family and our closest friends. my family went through this chemo thing with my sister in law (my brother's wife) 3 years ago who had a stage 3 diagnosis at 34. The only \u201cgood\" news in all that is it makes it easier for me as every knows the drill. She had exact opposite kind of IDC from me, ER- and HER2 positive but did TC also. My bone pain has subsided. I have been putting theseNUUM electrolyte tablets in water. Not sure if they helped or my body got better but not going to stop. Also helps with water boredom. They taste petty good especially with lots of ice. It looks like the pain is the chemo and not the neleusta. A welcome to all the newbies and good luck to those starting this week. The anticipation is harder, at least on the mind. I can now say I am 1/2 way through chemo. I do have a question re hair, cold capper not as I have extremely thin near bald spots. In feel more Brillo pad than peach fuzz. New hair coming in? And I noticed last night I lost a few clumps of eyelashes on one side. That made me mad. Eyebrows are ok so far. Have a good day  ",

      "Content": "Oct 11, 2018 01:53PM - edited Oct 11, 2018 02:01PM by Tigerlily318 Good afternoon all....had third of four TC yesterday. It was the most efficient of the three so far, picked up some interesting tid bits I thought I'd pass along and curious on your thoughts. I feel crappier today, day 1 after chemo than the other two rounds. It doesn't help that the hurricane has made its way to Massachusetts and it is gray and raining. And looking at the devastation in Florida is awful.  Wanderweg and KK, I too am having a little more pain, sensitivity, \"heaviness\" at my incision site. I asked if related to the chemo and they said no, just still healing even though I have some weeks with no pain, etc. I thought that was a little too convenient it would hurt post chemo. My range of motion though is very good, so they said just normal healing.  Happy belated Wanderweg and Sue, that is utterly ridiculous about work. Sorry about that and I hope it is going ok.  For the non-port people, they said it was normal to now have bruising/sensitivity in the nearby vein where I had the IV/infusion. Recommended icing, which I'm doing to the old and new spots and it is helping tremendously. I am going each course in a different place to minimize it. I have some bruising on my legs too but I bruise easily so who knows.  Each successive round I have a greater reaction to the steroids earlier. My face became puffy and red on Tuesday when  started taking them (I take 2 2x a day the day before chemo, a total of another 4 on the day of, and then I took 2 this am, will take 1 now...oops, need to go do that...and 1 tomorrow am. Those and the Zofran are the worst for me. I have mentioned before but only am doing the Zofran during the infusion and Compazine after, but don't really need it.  M-and-M37, I'm told the steroids help with nausea, prevent allergic reaction to taxotere, and help with inflammation. I hate them, though they were helpful to stay up to watch the Red Sox the other night.  As for the fun stuff....my husband and I had to postpone our trip to Costa Rica. We were supposed to leave 2 days after my final chemo and my MO said not a good idea immune wise to go to a 2nd world country. And it was to be an active trip, so why blow it. We postponed it to next Nov. I have to go to Hawaii again for work so my husband will go with me and we'll spend a long weekend there as well. That'll be end of January, early February. Enjoying the planning. I am seriously thinking about a small tattoo or double piercing my ears with small diamond studs. I am NOT a tattoo person so we'll see. It'd be tiny but a wave or dahlia. Will see. If anyone needs New England travel advise I'm your girl.  On a great note, all my genetics came back good with no mutations. Glad I did it.  On a sad note, my first cousin was diagnosed with DCIS on Monday. She is in shock. Convinced it is genetics but she has done 23 and me and I'm clean so I don't think so. She has appointments at Mass General with my same doctors on Monday and visited me at chemo yesterday which was nice. The thing about the DCIS is she'll need surgery, likely radiation, and perhaps hormone therapy, that part of the pathology is not back yet. She's pretty much where I was before I got my oncotype back. So while I'm glad it is DCIS for her, I don't want to say \"only\" DCIS as she's on this journey now too. She's 44, 11 months younger than me. I guess we have some breast cancer road races and events in our future.  Fairchild, hope you're feeling better! I have not had those issues though when I get my blood pressure checked it is a little high for me - damned steroids again. Yesterday was 130/80 which is decent. My heart rate has been around 110 or so, but yesterday was 90. But still didn't have pain. And, I like all the advice about the wedding. I would say if it is going to cause you stress, send a really nice gift and don't go. Do something fun for yourself. They will understand. Sorry about the timing, that just sucks. Piksie, I pray and have faith that you and everyone else in this group will beat it and live a long life. I love your attitude and philosophy on travel and doing things and hope that is a silver lining. Life is short regardless, especially if you don't life it to its fullest.  Hang in there all. I will say that my oncology NP was extremely enthusiastic about my occasional glass or two of wine. She said if I am feeling good enough for it, hooray!  ",

I have not been working out as much as I'd like to and need to and the pictures are inspiring. You rock! KK2018, Hamilton was AMAZING and worth every penny. I went in \"cold\", had not listened to the music and only knew basic plot and it was 3 hours of pure enjoyment. The fact that my beloved Red Sox later won the World Series made it a pretty awesome day.  My bumps persist. Not bugging me so much physically as the fact that they exist. It is my psychological as I want them to be from the chemo and not from something that will require another biopsy (recalling my experience from a few years ago). I have an ultra sound on Friday am for some abdomen pain I was having consistently on one side, not horrible, but consistent, more during my period. It has lessened - and I have not gotten a period since 9/18 (the night before my second chemo) - but I'd mentioned so I can't take that back from my primary care and have to go and do it. Hopefully it is nothing. I found out a few years ago I have a unicornuate uterus, and it's on that side, so likely the cause. I just have ultrasound/biopsy/medical test fear now. I imagine that won't go away.  Final TC Chemo is tomorrow. Psyched for that, seriously. It'll be Halloween and the Red Sox parade, so will have something to watch on television during the infusions. I had my radiation consult yesterday and that went well. They were super nice and they have a much nicer waiting room than the cancer center and infusion area. So that's a plus. Initially the resident suggested a bunch of creams, products that I said hell no to - why they suggest that I slather myself in petroleum is beyond me. But my actual radiation oncologist - who I love - came in and told me what non-toxic products to use. They all talked about how well I'm doing during chemo. So even though I'm bloated and feeling fat (I've gained about 6 lbs but it feels a lot more) and fatigued most of the time, I know I'm doing well and that was nice to hear.  Dolceb70, I hope that your first round went ok! And that chinchilla is hilarious. Made me laugh! We can all be so lucky. Have a good day all. ",

I would not sleep with your dog the few nights after chemo though I bet people do. But if your pet is otherwise healthy it is fine. I could not have dreamed of banishing my dog.

Also, you are not a douche bag. You tried, can't win them all. Piksie and Wanderweg, radiation is ok. It's a major pain in the ass going every day but I'm starting to get physical comfortable doing it. I lie on my stomach and the table is hard on my ribs. So far I am only slightly red and a bit swollen and sore but advil is taking care of it. I can't wear underwire but wearing sports bras that hold my boob up. I'm most worried about the underside. I'm done with 12/20 so 8 to go! I get a 4 day break after tomorrow which is probably good and finish on 1/3 (was supposed to be 1/2 but there was a system wide computer outage at the hospital one day and had to skip a day. I had to channel the anger/annoyance big time. Shit happens). On 1/2 I get my first Lupron shot and start AI, if I have the terminology correct.  I still look like a cancer patient. My eyelashes are coming back but still sparse and my eyes are puffy and the area right by my eyelashes is reddish/brownish. I found some good eyeliner from Tarte where I can get a good thin line close to the lashes and it stays on when my eyes water. Of course when the bloody things fall out they fall in your eye. And I have a slash in one eyebrow. Like David Ortiz, but not intentional. Eyebrow pencil works, though it rubs off during radiation because I have to lie on my face. I like the pencils better than the gels.  Piksie, congrats on being PFC! But totally get you that it is not over. But will be. Hope the pain gets better. There is a very nice bell at radiation. A ship's bell (it is Boston after all). Some of you lamented I didn't ring a bell after chemo, but I'm realizing it would have seemed strange, not being done. Ringing this bell will feel great. I felt similarly with chemo angels. It's a great thing but for me it occurred at a weird time, in the middle, and just stopped but I still have radiation. I'm not complaining, I just see it all as a continuum and 1/3 will be my day to be done (notwithstanding the 10 years of drugs).  Great picture sunocean..... And ginger, at least something is done....that's good news.  ",

So, I spoke to a nurse at my cancer center this morning and while they cannot completely be sure from 5000 miles away, it appears that I had a rare reaction to Zometa. I started to google and suspect my symptoms were not really GI, especially the fatigue. My appetite is back, the Prilosec did nothing, and I think I mistook severe muscle pain for acid reflux. Might have had a touch of it. I am getting better and right now just feel tired and like I pulled a few muscles around my right ribs, but mostly when I breathe or move. Will go In if not better by Monday. Morale of the story, no new drugs or infusions before going to Hawaii or anything big planned. So if you end up going down the Zometa route, be aware. They really downplayed it for me. At the airport now waiting for our overnight flight to Atlanta, and then on to Boston. Have a good weekend all. Good luck on Monday Beeline",

I also brought in hats and trinkets for New Year's Eve. I didn't get something for my Chemo Nurse - we didn't really bond and she was gone for one of the sessions. I wanted to do something for the acupuncturist but couldn't decide on what - he mentioned something about his diet one day and so I thought cookies were out. That still bugs me. Not sure if it will coincide with Easter candy or spring flowers or something seasonal? OMG re cupping! I tried it once and about 10 minutes in I called to my acupuncturist to get them the F off me! I was so claustrophobic! I would burn all of the anti-nausea meds I didn't use, especially the Zofram - better than flushing it right? And all of the bras I bought that were horrendous before I finally found some that work - especially the ones with the billion hooks up the front.

I ended up constipated and by the time I realized it it had happened - spoke to a nurse yesteday and taking Colase (stool softener) a few times day day. Got a bottle of CVS brand. The constant stabbing pain is starting now to go away and things are moving. Also got some fiber gummies as fruit is not appealing right now. I am unsure what specifically caused this (chemo or meds)but will start taking the softener and fiber a few days days before chemo and continue unless they give me better advice. I also think the fatigue was because of the steroid withdrawal and they said we could they taper differently next time. My neulasta was on my arm. I have had joint and bone pain. Not awful but sucked with the other side effects. They kept me from moving/sleeping well. I feel very achy this morning but went for a walk and then to Yin Yoga and then another walk and much better. Plus taking Advil. And I just feel out of sorts. Everyone wants to help but no one can so awkward. I kind of want to be left alone. It is hard on everyone, but sent my husband to the beach today and spent some time with my dad who is the best of the lot at this and have finally returned text to people. So my advice? Water!!!!!! And move, and stool softener unless you have the opposite problem. And fiber. Just got some blue fish to grill tonight and some vegetables. Starting to want to eat something other than smoothies, pita, and hummus (I am choosing not to think that chick peas are a problem with estrogen based cancer....). Hair looks great wanderweg!!",

My thighs are killing me (as if I did a hike up a mountain) and I was extremely hungry all week, but that is starting to get better.  We are trying a CBD balm experiment on my husband's neck starting today. I bought some to help with the bone pain but it did not. He has an old neck injury that acts up this time of year, so we'll see!  I am losing clumps of eyelashes, but the ones left are super long from the revitalash.

I have continued to abstain from honey and unpasteurized juice and cheese but I guess I can start eating those things again too. Water still doesn't taste great, so I'm been loading up on herbal tea. Seltzer is ok when I'm really thirsty.  So, I went for my radiation mapping on 11/12 and got a call last week that they don't like it and I'm going back tomorrow to redo it all. I guess my plan has changed, though they are still on target for 12/3 assuming tomorrow works. I'm annoyed but want them to get it right. It looks like I get 4 more tattoos.  I also met with a naturopath, doctor of natural medicine. She advised me to take theanine and sage tea for the hotflashes since evening primrose (which I thought was safe), black cohash, CBD, and a number of other things are off the table. Also, no hemp, soy, or flax. It happens into something fine but I should not be going out of my way or taking any as supplements since I'm so highly estrogen positive (95%). I had no clue what caused progesterone - google is not very helpful there. It was very, very helpful to talk to someone and most of it was right in line with the hospital, just more in depth. I'm going to do some actual testing in February but there is no point now being so close to chemo. The hospital is saying no biotin and collagen during radiation, but I want to confirm that tomorrow. has anyone else heard that? It makes me sad re my hair, which is growing.....though the naturopath said that the biotin probably isn't helping.  My legs are still stiff, sore, painful, tired....wondering when that will go away from the Taxotere.  Again, hang in there all! Hope the holidays are doing more cheering than jeering. ",

I had the same experience, though I did TC and not AC. The chemo week I didn't feel great and so didn't eat as much but never lost my appetite. But the week after and as I started to feel better I was starving! And it got worse as I got farther through chemo. My nurses said it was the steroids and the fact that breast cancer drugs (generally) cause less nausea than people stereotypically think about when they think about chemo. There were some days I could not get enough food. I'm lucky I didn't gain more weight and fortunately I've lost it all and then some. If you got the banana flavored bile looking like crap for the mouth sores I'm sorry. I couldn't stomach it. I used a lot of coconut oil/water to swish. I went to the dentist yesterday for the first time since all this stuff and they said my teeth looked great. That was reassuring. And I thought I had bumps on my tongue, but apparently nothing concerning. Sue....sounds like you are having some fun! Belly dancing would be fun.... I closed the loop with MGH about the Zometa reaction yesterday (sort of). And am going to rewrite their side effect list and bring it to them next time I go in. They have 6 months to figure out how not to kill me next time. I spoke to a woman over the weekend who had a similar Zometa experience years ago - same oncologist - and they figured it out for her. I was relieved to not be the only one apparently to EVER have that happen. I'm a little freaked out by some muscle tenderness on my right side, but my torso in general is still a little sore all over. Other than that I'm pretty much back to normal. And need to get back to exercising again. I have a real vacation coming up next week and intend to enjoy this one. My normal is actually getting better....sleep issues still but soreness from the AI/OS is improving. Enjoy the snow Brink and the rest of you in the NE :)",

So your health plan will dictate what is required for referrals and authorizations. I am in a PPO so I did not need referrals - I was able to schedule and see, which is why I was able to start everything so quickly. I called my insurance company the day I was diagnosed since I never had really used it aside for preventive care and 1) confirmed no referrals and 2) ensured that my second opinion was considered an in plan (not out of plan) provider as the costs can be different (mine are) and cost YOU more if you chose to go out of network/plan. So I didn't need anything and my doctor's office was great about faxing records and other information over ASAP. Depending on the area/provider you may need to grease those wheels. I'm guessing if they are saying that you need a referral you have given them your insurance information and they know, but worth checking both on your own and asking to make sure. Depending on the environment/competition, sometimes doctors and hospitals are difficult about this process because they want the business.  My hunch is that JNKK has a plan like mine which is why it was not a big deal, similar to me. I had the same experience as JNKK.  Also re second opinions - of course get one or two if you want one, but it also depends where you are. I knew with my diagnosis and being in Boston and talking to a lot of folks and reading the plan of care would be the same. So I canceled by \"first opinion\" at my practice with a very, very good surgeon because I preferred the team approach at Mass General where I am now and knew with me there is a standard protocol. I googled the hell out of what they were telling me and discussed it with a few others. However, if I had stage II or III or a less common form I would have been different.  It will also help hugely if you decide to go to a practice where you are not a patient to call ahead and get a medical record/patient number. You usually have to do that to make an appointment. So I am at a hospital affiliated with Partners Health Care in Mass and had not been there before. A friend who works at MGH told me to call and register ASAP. When Mass General called me to schedule I had the number/registration (it was a phone call that took 45 min or so) and could schedule rather than say, no I'm not a patient, call, register, and call back. That made the difference for me in getting diagnosed on a Friday and into Mass General on Monday for a consult. It was after that I canceled my first opinion because I would have had surgery with the surgeon and THEN met with the oncologist and radiation on oncologist after surgery, versus meeting everyone at once.  Good luck - and call your insurance company if you have not....

      "Content": "Sep 13, 2018 07:00AM - edited Sep 13, 2018 07:00AM by Tigerlily318 Thanks pcranky....they are talking to me on Tuesday, my next TC day, about tapering the steroids and about how to handle the anti-nausea with the side effects I had. I imagine I'll be having that conversation with them. I keep saying that one of the hardest things about this situation is all the drugs. I'd never taken any of these drugs before so it's hard to know if the side effects are the chemo, the drugs, the combo, which one, etc.  Also, I live in a state with legal pot. I have never used it but was curious about whether I should consider it and/or CBD oil. I know a lot of people using CBD oil (which is more widely legal across states) instead of Advil and other pain killers, for a variety of reasons. I joined a great group on FaceBook called \"Fighting Breast Cancer with Cannabis\". I quickly learned that THC (the active ingredient) is not good for estrogen based cancers, there is research and studies that it can make it worse and grow tumors. There are also contradictions with tamoxifen and I believe other drugs. It was pretty eye opening, especially living in a state where legal recreational shops are about to open in addition to medical. Everyone here is in this \"pot cures\" all mode and it isn't true. So just putting that out there, it's obvious a personal choice and something that will vary for everyone because cancers are different and of course due to work, legal, and other issues. I believe there is now a group on this site too about cannabis.  Welcome Soozy, 70charger, and Fairchild - and I echo the call to call the doctors/nurses. It has been made really clear to me to call, when it doubt call, and don't worry about calling. We should not have to suffer more than we need to. ",

I do have some form of mouth something, but not full on thrush as my tongue is clear. Got the prescription mouthwash that tastes like fruit and looks like snot or regurgitated bananas depending on your point of view, but no antibiotics or whatever else they give you. No bell to ring - just lots of hugs - but it makes sense as I'm not done yet. Looking at having finished round 2/4 - surgery, chemo, radiation, hormone therapy. In addition to radiation mapping on 11/12 and starting 12/3, I scheduled my first Lupron shot for 1/2. Happy New Year to me!  The nelausta (onpro) shot is the standard of care at MGH. I asked yesterday how many get it and was told almost everybody. The thing should go off in about 40 minutes. I love saving the trip and overall it is good. But I hate you can't shower or work out more than walk with it. I would have loved to do yoga today while I'm on the 'roids, but I'm afraid of ripping it off.  Piksie, I hear you about the ID! I got married January 1 and have not changed my name! I realized if I do it, then I need a new license and so I'm delaying. My license which requires a new picture expires on 3/19, so hoping for hair by then! I am chopping off my cold cap mullet a week from Saturday. The scraggling stuff no longer looks any good under a cap, so hoping for regrowth. My MO was cool with it. I told him and he agrees that anyone doing Paxman needs to wet their hair more than they say to - he's talking to him about it. So some advice. I have thin hair but a lot of hair and I don't think it got through the first round. Minimal shedding (relatively) since the first big loss after the first round.  JNKK, looking forward to you checking in. And Mt. Kushmore congrats - something to look forward to!",

It was likely mostly from the Zofran which was one of the anti-nausea drugs I was prescribed. From rounds 2-4, I was advised to start taking colace a few days before chemo and continue until I felt right along with sennakot (senna) at night. I also stopped taking Zofran - they also gave me compazine and I used that BUT only too a few. I really didn't need anti-nausea medication. I didn't know that first round. I only got Zofran in my IV. I also switched to a softer diet (e.g., soups, etc. ) the couple of days before hand and then kept a few days after. I had virtually no issues with pain the final 3 rounds. I wasn't 100% right, but no big deal. I also was told I could take Miralax. Metamucil was never mentioned. I don't know anything about it, but the first round was my worst one in terms of pain and so if you're worried about it, discuss with your MO and/or nurse. My group has been more open about supplements that the advice others have been give. But, I'll say I would not wish that pain on anyone. I almost went to the ER. Piskie, I am glad to hear your doing better and sorry it has been so rough! Hang in there. Elizabeth, I hope you get back to it soon, sorry to hear about the setback. And I get you about the loneliness. I hope it passes and you find a way to feel support and strength. Brink, glad your resting heart rate is down. Mine has been elevated as well. For all still in chemo, hope you're doing ok and keep at it! I'm now officially over 4 weeks post chemo. My face is till puffy, my legs still feel like cement, I still have black lines down some of my nails (but no pain or lifting), and I still need a hat but I see a lot of dot sized regrowth to pair with my demented pixie and it does not look gray! Hallelujah! I am hoping I might be able to try toppik soon and go hat free in the next few weeks. The hat is a drag when I'm not at home because of the hot flashes. I cannot remember if I mentioned but I saw a neuropath to help with that and get better advice and what is and is not estrogen and progesterone causing and how to handle the hot flashes. Some days I have a lot and some days none. I have cut back on drinking, so know it is not an occasional glass or two of wine. I start radiation on Monday. My re-mapping is going to have me be on my stomach for radiation rather than the normal back. Given it is my left side I'm not sure they prefer back with the breathing method over the stomach....a question for Monday. I also never excelled in Geometry so glad there are doctors that did.",

It is growing but you can still see my scalp. This afternoon I experimented with toppik even though my crown is still pretty bald. It covered it and I think I can make it look slightly better - this is post shower, hat, and yoga. I have a bunch of meetings this week with people I see twice a year. Debating between the hats/caps and this look. I might do it. Oh, and I can fill in the switchblade cut in my left eyebrow. I am taking collagen and biotin and was doing minoxidil but wondering if it is all overkill and its going to do what its going to do. So a terrible picture, but sort of hopeful. I still have chemo bloat....but at. m feeling better 5 1/2 weeks out. My legs are still very sore but I wasn't tired all weekend, which was a plus. Being positive, I'm glad you made a decision and hope you can be at peace with it. Everyone else, I hope you're managing the side effects ok. Just know that every day is a day closer to not feeling like crap. ",

Being Positive, I have been wearing a baseball hat to the gym and a cap for yoga. But if I get hot, I've taken it off. I make sure I'm in the corner but I've tried to get over it. I am also starting lupron and femara in a couple of weeks, 1/2 to be precise. Some of my chemo induced menopause symptoms are waning a bit. I'm trying to remain positive about the drugs. Sunocean, hang in there! Hope you have not spiked a fever and are still home. I'm obsessed with my head. This week I went short at work, courtesy of Toppik. The crappy part is I can't wear a hat because my hair then frizzes out. So while I'm more comfortable inside, outside is cold. I wore a coat with a hood and didn't get it too close to my head. I'm grateful for hair, but the head issues continue. I am shocked at how fast my eyelashes are coming back and my days of non-tweezing are over. I would have a complete unibrow if I didn't keep it under control. The hair is starting to pop up again, so that's a good sign. I have to admit that the one benefit of radiation is having more regular doctor and nurse contact. They ask how you're doing with everything and it's nice to have the support/perspective. I'm through with 8 of 20 rads and no symptoms from the radiation but they're on top of the chemo stuff. Radiation is much more festive in general than chemo. And, there is a bell at radiation. That make sense to me - will ring it when I'm done with all but the hormone therapy. Hope you all have a nice, healthy weekend.  ",

Half way done with radiation yesterday. It's better than chemo. I have to say. But tiring going every day. I have two raised bumps on my tongue and my throat feels scratchy. The MO gave me a prescription last time and I wasn't great about using it 4 x a day - it looked like bile and tasted like bananas. Nasty. But now I'm starting to obsess about these two bumps. I had a thing taken off my tongue a few years ago. Biopsy was fine. It was probably a cut that didn't heal well. Hoping these go AWAY. Anyone else? They are tongue colored, so pink I guess. For the holidays, do what brings you joy. That's what I say. I got married on 1/1 last year and didn't bake my usual cookies. Was going to bail this year too, but now I want to bake. A few. Not the usual million. Will post pictures this weekend. I'm done with shopping and wrapping. I was so worried about being wiped out from radiation that I did really early.

The hardest part of this entire thing is the inability to predict the figure. I too am like you, I don't someday to wish I'd done more, but I think you are fortunate to have an MO that is putting it all out there. You may have mentioned in prior posts, but do you have other oncologists to ask? I found that my SO and RO were also great about sharing their opinions. My SO specially so. She was the one who got my oncotype first and said the chemo and that was helpful, to me. Beeline and others, one thing to ask about is Zometa, which is given to \"us\" to help prevent osteoporosis. It came up at my last onco appt and post chemo. I had my first infusion yesterday. Not all of the studies are conclusive, but it seems to be newer for premenopausal women or women on the bubble, to help prevent bone mets, and it known to improve risks from AIs. Side effects are similar to the AIs and it seems like some insurance. I've been googling and find slight benefit to a lot of benefit but also not a lot on young women and women in their 40's. Anyway, as presented to me and from what I found seemed like a no brainer. https://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/2011121... It wasn't a lot of fun yesterday to be hooked up to an IV but taking claritin and staying hydrated is something I do anyway. And I haven't noticed anything yet. Just something to think about. I had not noticed it come up much. Brink, my brother brought me Phyto products from France. My lashes and brows are doing great. I am hopefully I won't lose them again. It's three months out today. Fingers crossed. Stay warm ya'll. The polar vortex hit Massachusetts last night. It was 0 when we left this morning for the airport.

It is all part of the chemo \u201cpod\u201d. My sister in law used penguin caps a few years ago and did well but it was before MGH had the machines at their centers and they had to supply their own dry ice which was a real pain. She was double negative, HER 2+ and I am not sure of the exact chemo but stronger, I think AC, and she had to do six rounds. I have to read all the stuff and watch the videos and practice with the cap this weekend. I cut my fair to my chin.

I have a lot of hair but it is fine.  Welcome Beeline. I am 1A and it stayed that way through surgery and was also hoping to avoid chemo. Alas....I made call based on an oncotype of 20, which I got because it had not spread to my lymph nodes, and my age (45)",

I took one Compazine instead of Zofran and will probably take one more for the sake of it, but no nausea and no constipation! I put some miralax in my smoothie this am for good measure.

I'm sorry to all for the SE, general shit, and lousy feelings but we will get through it! I am day 6 after round 2 of 2/4 TC and feeling much better today. This cycle overall was much, much better than the first one. No GI issues since I only did the Zofran in the IV, took sennekot every night, and stuck largely to a liquid diet + bread. My bone pain was worse this time so I upped the Advil/alieve combo. Last night my shins were killing me. And I had a headache for about 48 hours which is abating. I can't concentrate on anything too hard.  Since my infusion I have walked a little less, shorter dog walks, he's pissed, but went to Zumba yesterday and yoga today. I also started a mind based stress reduction class on Thursday. I plan to do Zumba or yoga most days this week. That's the only time my bones didn't hurt, but then I'd get tired. Today I also went to an artisan/farmers market, rearranged our food drawers (we have deep drawers rather than a pantry), and I'm trying to do a few work emails before I head to Whole Foods. Oh, I went to CVS. Most importantly, I enjoyed it all and didn't feel like crap. That's what I hold on to.  My hair has been a disaster. As my husband just said yesterday, wow, that cold cap really didn't do much did it? (he then quickly said he didn't care, it'll grow back, all the right things....not knocking him). The only good thing is that It is pretty evenly thin up top. I don't have patches. I've only got 2 more so still stick it out as I think/hope it will help with regrowth. I not going to do a wig, I've just embraced caps. A friend gave me a hand me down from chemo beanies that is ruffled (that sounds awful but it is not) and I ordered a few more. I ordered a couple to work out in too, though for cardio I wear a baseball hat. I also love day of the dead, so found one with sugar skulls on it and ordered that too. Thank god they are cheap.  I will say that yesterday we went out for a late lunch/early dinner (oh yeah, my appetite has been OUT OF CONTROL), and the waitress as normal as could be complimented the beanie I was wearing and said how pretty it was. It was as if she complimented my bag or sweater. That was really nice actually. I am paying careful attention to all the discussion re hot flashes. None yet for me.  Oh, also wanted to recommend the memoir \"Flat\". It just came out and is by Catherine Guthrie. She's a health writer for many women's magazines so you may recognize the name. It's about her journey through BC with her partner Mary and about her decision to not have reconstruction. She's a non-conformist but talks a lot about how male gendered breast cancer treatment and how it is about you taking control of our own body. I am thoroughly enjoying it and she's very funny and relatable. I also am going to read How to Help a Friend Who is Sick and then my best friend is making me read a non-cancer book. I did just finish David Bowie's biography but she says that doesn't count. Too much cancer at the end. Anyway, highly recommend Flat.  Enjoy the rest of this Sunday or the start of the week to our friends down under. ",

I got a giant bottle of coconut oil and have been using it on everything, body, nails, scalp and have had no issues with dry skin or nails. I also swish with it and water in my mouth. Forget who told me to do that. No mouth sores this last round at all.  I have kept up with my coffee, I do a couple shots of (black) organic espresso in the morning. Since I don't abuse it I'm keeping it. I'm being more careful about it when I don't make it, only a shot if not organic or getting organic. I have researched so much about coffee and I don't believe the coffee is harmful. Plus it helps with constipation.  I am now noticing two small bruises, one on each hand over a vein - I had an IV for chemo on 8/29 on my right hand and the IV on 9/18 in my left. Will be curious to see what they say. Neither hurt.  Heather - neulasta is given where I am - everyone gets it, so find it curious that it varies so much.  Fairchild - ask the oncologist. Mine explained each one and I got fact sheets on them and I did my own research. Your cocktail is different, though I know the Herceptin is for HER2+. Someone recommend that I read the making of Herceptin (or something like that). Apparently getting it to market was incredible political and it almost didn't happen. Being a politics geek and studying public administration it sounds right my alley bookwise.  So sorry for all of you that are sick, dealing with tooth issues, etc. Life happens right....I'm petrified of getting a cold and something delaying my next round. Going to go into partial hibernation this weekend though I have my nephew's baptism this weekend. My sister in law scheduled a private services on Saturday in part because of me. I thought that was very sweet. ",

I'm now 14 days post Round 3 of 4 of TC and CANNOT WAIT for next Wednesday. I don't know if the weepiness is because I'm tired, menopause stuff happening, or because my husband, who has been great, was a dickhead the other night. He's not an apologizer, he just does better. So he is, but it sure set me off towards the weepiness. I've always had control over my emotions for the most part and don't at the moment. This round has been harder. I have that almost but not quite sick feeling, the icky feeling that I can't describe to anyone. I also, have not been wearing my reading glasses because I don't like wearing them with my chemo beanies at work. I'm working from home tomorrow and Friday. I'm sucking it up today at work and the next two days can wear my classes without a hat.  Speaking of hair, my chin length straggling hair is getting thinner and thinner. I think I'm going to schedule an apt in the next couple of weeks to get myself a balding pixie. It's not going to happen where I can keep the length and regrowth and the hair sticking out of the baseball hat or beanie is getting less and less. I plan to go with wet hair and not blow it dry. My stylist knows what's up and has worked with others in this situation. There is so little to cut I don't care what the cold capping people say - it's all about my scalp at this point there.  On a positive note, we're going to see Hamilton on Sunday (can't wait!) and my beloved Red Sox are in the World Series. So working hard to stay up late for those. And my brain seems to be working ok cognitively. So far.... ",

I am back from Florida - where the weather was fantastic - and off to New Orleans in the morning, weather permitting. Wanderweg - I hope you're doing all right with the rain. That picture is crazy. Regarding FB, I'd be up for it, but I also didn't share anything about this journey until very recently and do not post about it. However, we could have a FB messenger group. It's a little more accessible, especially from a phone. I have a group with some college friends and it comes in handy and is a lot of fun. Fairchild, I hope you figure out what's going on and that things start to calm down. I get how unsettling it is, just when you think the sailing should be smooth(er). KK, I hope you enjoyed Mexico! That's a great spot. Brink, glad you have a date! I have done a little bit too much traveling lately, and it will calm down for me in March. The silver lining in this whole thing has been finally adhering to even healthier habits. Some things I did really well. Other things lacked consistency, especially water and cardio and supplements. Now that I have it down, I feel a lot better and some things that bothered me in the past - inflammation in my hip and a chronic cough are gone. So I'm figuring out how to keep them going with the travel, because the travel will not go away for me. I'm also working on my husband to go meatless for a month, aka lent for me. Here is my hair update, btw January 6 and tonight. I am surprised at the difference and it is starting to not just stick straight up! What you can't see in this picture really is the fact that my hair is different textures - between what I kept that was brown (still fine), gray that survived chemo (of course), and is now coming in new with chemo curls, brown and gray. I spent an hour at Blue Mercury this weekend playing with hair products that in the past were too much for my fine hair. I am now understanding why so many women who get breast cancer keep short hair......but I'm going to tough it out.      ",
