I was told it would take less than an hour and it took an hour and 45 minutes.  The table is very uncomfortable and your head is not facing down but turned on one side for the length of the biopsy.  You can't move your head.  The breast is hanging down thru a hole and the table is raised and compression is applied to the breast, (not as tight as a reg mammo) and they took alot of x-rays on me to try to get the wire in place before using the stereotactic device.  I have a history of back and neck problems so I met with my chiro in advance and also used some thermacare heat patches on my neck and back during the procedure.  It took me 10 days for my neck to recover.  They did not get it all and it is cancer.  So I have two choices, mastectomy or breast conserving with radiation for 6 weeks and some kind of med for 3-5 years.  I meet with one of my oncologists on Monday.  Talk to your doctor on forms of sedation available to you.  Good luck to you and God Bless....CAJ",
