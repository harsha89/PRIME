I had a breast MRI before surgery.  I'm not claustrophobic but I do get anxiety and panic attacks whenever I have a doctor's appointment, it's worse when I have to be scanned by some weird, loud sci-fi looking machine.  My MRI lasted about 45 minutes, I think and by the end I just wanted out of there!  I had taken Xanax and Klonopin beforehand but it got increasingly harder to stay still and I started to hyperventilate a little. My husband is taking me to both simulations so I can be 'medicated' again and not have to drive. Whew!  ;) I guess what I'm asking is, are these simulations scary at all?  How many people are in the room?  Will they draw on me with markers at both sessions?  How long does a CT Scan take? Ugh...  I used to be such a rational person before BC. :p  Dx 5/8/2018, IDC, Left, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/lungs/other, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It wasn't even uncomfortable since I'm pretty well healed by now. It took about 15 minutes and I had two very nice techs.  They drew on me with a sharpie but I wore an old t-shirt with no bra with and a hoodie over it, so no clothing damage was done. The machine was not intimidating in the least.   DH took me out for a nice breakfast afterwards.  :D   Not a bad experience at all. ",

I'm peeling under my arm and the skin feels really tight and raw but it's nothing compared to what some of you guys are dealing with.  I'm really sore too, it's worse than when I was actually in rads.  I read that your skin can get worse for about a week after your last treatment and then you'll start feeling better.  I can't wait till Wednesday!  'We all need to celebrate New Year's 2010 like it's 1999!!!'  I couldn't agree with you more, Niknak!!!  :D",

No amount of logic seems to help.  I think I'm becoming gradually desensitized to the machine, though.  I forgot my earplugs today and my sleep mask was pulled away a little at the bottom. I opened my eyes half way through and saw part of that round-shaped ray-shooter, whatever it's called.  I didn't cry or faint which surprised me.  I may be able to try this soon without the mask!  :D The worst part for me is waiting in the inner 'patients only'  waiting room.  There are SO many people there.  Mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers and fathers.  Occasionally there's someone my own age.  It's so upsetting.  It's bad enough that I have to have rads. It's just that SO MANY people have to have rads and I'm sure some of them have a worse prognosis than mine.  I always end up crying when I have to wait in there.  :(  I know it can't be good for the other patients to see me bawl. I arranged with my tech (she's an absolute angel!)  that I can wait in the outer waiting room...  or pace back and forth outside the entrance, and she will come and get me. Ugh, sorry about that!  I just needed to vent!!!   ",

I had my treatment in a different room with a different machine  I had #10 today.   I'm just starting to get pink... and tired too.  No burning yet but I'm pretty sore.  I only waited in the patients waiting room a couple of times in the beginning and it was always full.  My time is 3:30. It seems like there are a lot of older people there at that time. I guess they remind me of my mom and I just tear up.  I'm so emotional lately!   Today I walked into the rads room without my sleep mask on!  :D  I put it on as soon as I got on the couch, though.  ;)  My rad tech was so proud of me.  Hooray for small victories!  ;)  Deb, I'm so glad you're more than half way done!  :D   Whew!!!  I bet a year from now we'll all be wondering what the big deal was.  May we never be in this situation again!!!  :D I read somewhere on this forum about laying a washcloth  soaked in 10% apple cider vinegar on the rads breast after treatment for 10-15 minutes.  It's supposed to reduce the pinkness and help you feel better.  I haven't tried it yet but I think I might do that tomorrow.  My rad onc gave me the hairy eyeball when I asked her about it, but she said it wouldn't hurt anything. I am going to give it a try.  I'll let you know how it goes.  :)",

I don't know what to do about the arm stiffness/soreness.  Yoga isn't helping much.  I'll ask my regular onc about it when I see her again next month.  I've been drinking 3 cups of coffee every day for the fatigue.  It helps a little.  Normally if I drank that much coffee I'd be bouncing off the walls.   Some YSC pals have told me it's possible to get zapped twice in one day as long as the sessions are at least 6 hours apart.  Hehe, I'm not telling the RO where I heard that.  ;) My rad center was closed on Thanksgiving and didn't reopen till the following Monday.

I haven't taken Xanax or Klonopin in a long time.  I was only taking them as needed for doctor visits.  I just read the labels again.  It says to take 1/2 a tab of Klonopin twice a day and 1  Xanax twice a day.  I'm going to try following the directions and see if that helps.  I already feel better.  I'm not shaking anymore and I feel much calmer.  Whew!!!  Maybe I won't need the Ativan after all. lissak, loved that video!  :) Lisa1970, how are you doing?  Did you make it through your CT scan OK?  Is anyone else trying the 1 glass of red wine a day thing to prevent radiation burns?  I forgot to do that the first day but I had a glass last night. We'll see if it helps...  Apparently 1 glass works, 2 not so well and 1/2 a glass doesn't have any effect. I also read on this forum that 10% cider vinegar soaks help with burning.  My doctor seemed dubious about this but she said it wouldn't hurt to try.  I'm considering starting that before I even begin to pink up.",

I do still have a sore spot on my side.  I'm not sure if it's a rib or not.  I'll see my rad onc for a follow-up appt. Monday. Fatigue started about week 3.  It felt like I was on cold medecine, just kind of tired and goofy. I took naps when I needed them and went to bed early.  It really hit me after rads was over and I spent a lot of time on the couch.  Then about 11 days after treatment ended I woke up one morning and my energy was back.  :) Rads can be scary and inconvenient and tiring but I'm glad now that I did it.  There may be some microscopic cancer cells left after surgery and I wanted to do everything I could to kill the nasty little things.  I'm on Tamoxifen now because I'm ER+ but you are ER- and don't have that option. If I was in your shoes I'd do the rads, as much as I hated it.  ;) Hugs!!!  -Tamara ",

      "Content": "Sparrow wrote: *RANT WARNING* I'll apologize in advance, I need to vent and I don't want to call my sister at this hour. The director of my breast imaging center  gave me the news last Wednesday- '2 small malignancies, very treatable'.  He said I need to get an MRI 'to be sure we didn't miss anything'. He also referred me to a breast surgeon. The surgeon's receptionist said I need to have the MRI  first before he will see me.  There is a waiting list right now for MRIs that is two weeks long!  I have been calling the Breast Imaging center since Friday to get them to please fax my biopsy report to my PCP so she can send the order for an MRI.  They are supposed to do this automatically, BTW but my PCP hasn't received anything yet.  The same thing happened when I had to get a diagnostic mammogram, and then again when I needed an order for biopsies. This is a major breast imaging/cancer center I'm dealing with.  Why do I feel like I have to do their job for them?  I am anxious enough just having cancer!  Every call I make (with rare exceptions) is directed to someone or other's voice mail.  I am always polite and pleasant in the messages I leave, giving all the info they ask for,  but for some reason I can't get anyone to call me back. On top of all this I am dealing with severe panic attacks and anxiety.  I saw a psychiatrist last week right after my DX.  She increased my dose of Lexapro to 20mg and gave me Clonazepam 0.5mg for insomnia and Xanax 0.25mg for panic attacks.  The Xanax and Clonazepam are helping only slightly and the new dose of Lexapro will take a while to 'kick in'.  I start 'talk therapy' to learn 'coping strategies' this week.  The panic attacks have lessened in severity slightly but they are still there.  Last night I was reading an article on lumpectomies at the American Cancer Society's website.  I started feeling very cold, chilled to the bone and my teeth started chattering (the room I was in was not at all cold).  I got up confused, thinking a hot shower would make me feel better and my legs were weak. I had tunnel vision and dizziness/nausea, like I was going to pass out.  I read later that this is another kind of panic attack.  My usual kind is hyperventillation, racing heart, ect. All this extra time I have to worry about what the surgery and god knows what else will be like is very hard to handle. I don't think I can even stand an MRI.  I have never been claustrophobic but I have been terrified of medical equipment ever since my biopsies.  I feel like running out my front door right now and just not ever stopping.  I feel like giving up and just not getting any treatment at all.  I don't want surgery, chemo, radiation. I can't do it!!!   I feel like I'm either going to end up with a healthy mind or a healthy body.  I'm not sure I can manage both. If you've read this far, I'm sorry and bless you!  :)  Before I started dealing with BC I was a rational person...  you'll have to take my word on that, I guess.  ;)  Dx 5/8/2018, IDC, Left, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/lungs/other, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Some people may believe this because they often feel worse after the operation than they did before. It is normal to feel this way when you start to recover from any surgery. And sometimes, no one knows that the cancer has spread until it is seen during surgery. Because of this, some people may link surgery with widespread cancer. But cancer does not spread because it has been exposed to air. If you put off or refuse surgery because of this myth, you may be harming yourself by passing up effective treatment. Here's the link to the article 'For Women Facing a Breast Biopsy': http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_6x_For_Women_Facing_a_Breast_Biopsy.asp?sitearea=  Well, if that didn't make a link you can always cut & paste...  I'm not the sharpest crayon in the box, especially today.  ;)   I found that article really helpful, it explains just about everything you'd ever want to know about biopsies. 'Keep swimming'!!! :)   I'll be sending good thoughts your way!  :) ",
