She told me its one of the safest to use on chemo hair. She is herself a BC survivor. I finished Taxol 9 months ago, still getting Herceptin every 3 weeks til June. I have gotten my hair trimmed several times and have it colored twice. I feel that it helped me, it seemed to grow faster and helped it thicken up. The top is still not as thick as sides and back, but it was thinner on top to start. It is kinda spendy, but I didn't cut, color my hair for over 9 months, saved a bunch on hair products. And I think I'm worth it!",

I had my first Taxol/Herceptin treatment last Wednesday and still not sure about it, but plan on continuing with the treatment. I agree about the consistency, but also realize each person is different. My husband encouraged me to do treatment. 2nd treatment coming on Wednesday.",

All kinds of makeup tips, we practiced applying it, got a makeup bag full of makeup to take home. She did a demo of scarfs and suggestion for summer coming up. She showed a fringe hairpiece, just bangs with hair in the back over ears, nothing on top. You can wear a scarf or hat, looked very natural. We had a good laugh, the gal with no hair was her model and the hairpiece was blond. She said her boyfriend said he'd like to see her as a blond. Great option for summer heat. Went out for supper after that. MO suggest starting the claritin tonight for 5 days to see if helps with joint pain. Also don't wait too long to take a anti nausea pill or start a laxative, try and stay ahead of things. My blood counts all look great she said. Feeling pretty positive, if each week went like this, piece of cake. 2 down, 10 to go!",

My port was being kind of stingy giving blood, its very positional. Nurse had me leaning forward, lifting my arms, standing, laying down, finally got it going so we could it start. Always makes me a little nervous, but they always get it. She explained it probably gets to the side of the vessel and it takes a little coaxing to get it to move. Stopped to have supper after with my hubby. Still haven't lost any hair, expecting it any day. Have appt tomorrow with my sister to make a choice on wig and get it ready.. No neuropathy yet either. Hope I feel as good tomorrow, got lots planned, t-ball with grandson, groceries and get packed for the lake. Daughter and her twins coming for the weekend. Started my claritin and stool softeners tonight. Since I haven't been having any issues after my treatment, PA said she doesn't need to see me prior to next weeks infusion, just labs before.

It saves radiating the whole breast and I still get the effects of concentrated radiation but with really no side effects. After the last treatment they slide the catheter out and you are done. Only downside was you couldn't shower with the catheter in place! My RO gave me this option, there were some criteria that had to be met to use it I would totally recommend it to anyone.",

Except this week, I think the nurse got the needle directly in the center, it worked right away. Always get a little nervous about this part..",

It wasn't so bad, got laundry, cleaning, mowed lawn, but Day 3 you come down off that. I have been feeling really good. The only not so good days were 3 & 4, I had a lot of bone pain. I took Claritin and ibuprofin for a couple of days. Day 6 & 7 were feeling normal, did some errands and shopping today, even went out for supper last night. I hope treatment tomorrow goes as well. Had an appt with wig consultant today (being proactive) and taking a Look Good Feel Better class tomorrow afternoon. Makeup and skincare tips plus a goody bag of samples. The only reason they said I had to have a driver was because of the benedryl, it makes me very sleepy. I'm not sure if they give it each time or not, said it was to make sure no allergic reaction to chemo. Hope Friday goes well for you,",
