I was diagnosed with with Stage 1 Grade 2 ILC  breast cancer (left side) in July 06. Had lumpectomy, then mastectomy, chemo, herceptin (had to stop at 12 rounds because of reduced heart function) and Arimidex since Feb.07. This week have been diagnosed with recurrence of ILC in breast wall of mastectomy site and mets to spine - L3.  I'm in shock and terrified because of info on various websites that all give a very poor prognosis. Please let me hear some good news from anyone with a similar condition who is still going strong after several years.  My grandchildren are the loves of my life and I desperately want to believe I will be able to see them grow up.",
