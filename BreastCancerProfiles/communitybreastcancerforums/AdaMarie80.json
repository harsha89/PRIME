But the one with the intensely enhancing mass with washout kinetics is the one I'm very concerned about. So I'm curious if folks have seen that description and been diagnosed, if 4B is more worrisome, if I've had swollen lymph nodes, but Radiology doesn't show them, could they still be involved? It's just all so much to take in now",

      "Content": "AdaMarie80 wrote: After having swollen lymph nodes in both sides under my armpits/axilla areas, I went to see the breast surgeon. I have a \"variant of unknown significance\" of the BRCA genes. The mammo showed nothing, the ultrasound showed nothing, so prior to scheduling a lymph node removal they ordered a bilateral breast MRI. The results came back mentioning 3 areas of concern, and the rating is 4b. I hope this is ok, but I'd like to share the exact wording/report notes, and see if anyone has had similar reports and either been benign or malignant. Waiting is the worst. The second look Ultrasound today did not see them (although I feel like they barely looked) so I'm scheduled for an MRI biopsy left on Tuesday, and then MRI biopsy right on Thursday. Any advice, too or bad, is appreciated! Right Breast- suspicious, there are two new small enhancing masses Left Breast- suspicious, there is a small enhancing mass Both are categorized as 4B, moderately suspicious, and it also says that I have been identified for nurse navigator assistance. In the descriptions: Right Breast- there is an intensely enhancing mass, measured at 0.3cm x 0.6cm that demonstrates washout kinetics. There is second enhancing mass measured 0.5cm x 0.3cm demostrating a progressive kinetic enhancement pattern. There are also scattered fociof benign glandular enhancement. Left Breast- there is 0.6cm x 0.2cm enhancing mass. Both have no axillary subpectoral adenopathy, no large cysts, no dilated ducts. Any advice is appreciated! I am so nervous. I've been sick for a while, and the exact cause hasn't necessarily been identified, so a few of my specialists are very concerned. Log in to post a reply",
