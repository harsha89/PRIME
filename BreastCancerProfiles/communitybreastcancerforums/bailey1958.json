This site is great but it can also be scary because there is a lot of information and it took me a bit of time before I could read it without getting overwhelmed. I made an appointment right away with a counsellor who works with women who have  breast cancer at the BC cancer centre and I also talked with a couple of women with breast cancer through work who had really good outcomes and were so supportive. My family doctor was also great and gave me a really positive lecture and some medication (ativan) which helped with the anxiety initially.  There is a peer support program you can access through the cancer centre in Canada - I'm sure they exist in other countries. I think it is so important to have people to talk to - the people who I thought would be the most supportive (my sister) hasn't been able to help at all - I think she's too scared and the people who I thought would be no help have been great, Is there anyone you can reach out to just to listen to your fears and maybe go with you to appointments? Sometimes people who aren't family are a bit calmer and grounded and that can help you get grounded. I have heard so many amazing stories from people who were diagnosed really late in the process and have been cancer free for 18 years, one for 21. A woman in my home town had breast cancer in 1929, had her breast removed, no other treatment back then and died at 102 years of age - of old age. We have no idea what is going to be our outcomes and what is important to remember is that you will get through the surgery, get treatment, recover, fight to stay healthy and live a long and amazing life. I still have bad periods when I feel sorry for myself but ultimately I know that no amount of worrying will make the outcome different than what the outcome is going to be - and I have no idea what that is going to be. I also try not to get ahead of myself, this is a journey and it will take time and as much as i would like to skip ahead - I can't. This is a difficult life circumstance and there is no right or wrong way to go through this - we just have to take it one minute at a time. I have a real close friend who has been sick her whole life - chronic lung inflammation and crohns disease - when I asked her how she copes everyday with not knowing what her outcome is going to be she said \"I just ask myself when I get scared - am I ok right now? and I am - so that's what I focus on\" Hang in there! There are amazing, strong, incredible women on this site. I am so grateful to read and learn from them.",

The reality is that many women get those calls and after the full set of tests to make sure there is nothing to worry about they get the - \"it's benign\" call. You need to keep your focus positive and though it is scary and hard to go through this - the waiting is the worst. It is good they are on top of this and they are checking you thoroughly - that is the most important thing. I am 52 with fibrocystic breast tissue and have had sore and lumpy breasts my whole life - I've had so many biopsies over the past 20 years I've lost count - I think at least 8 - until my diagnosis in May - they were all benign. Every time I got the call back or the request to come for a biopsy I felt that scared feeling - hang in there - chances are you will be breathing a huge sigh of relief in another week. Bottom line is - whatever the outcome you will do what you need to do to get through this - in the mean time you don't know anything right now - no amount of worrying is going to change tomorrow - get some sleep - breathe, think of a beautiful place you've visited, and visualize yourself there with positive white light surrounding you.",

I work as a counsellor in a school and so I was fortunate to have this happen now because I don't have to work through it like so many of you (school teachers have babies in the summer, I have cancer) go figure!. Thankfully I can have this out of the way before September - but I really feel for all of you struggling with bras, drooping, etc. Hang in there !! Marilyn and Bennybear - I just can't imagine how difficult chemo would be to go through and I'm thinking without the support of family and friends helping with the day to day it would be so hard.  I certainly feel like I will support people who are dealing with illness much differently now that I have had this experience. I definitely am trying hard not to be hurt as I realize that when you seem \"well\" even though you've had cancer that it is probably easier to just see the person as better. It's weird -  cancer - cause people can look really well - I've made massive changes to my diet and level of fitness and the results are showing in a positive way - I think many friends think I'm doing really well and for the most part I am but it can still be lonely late a night when everyone else is asleep or when your mind is racing with thoughts like - maybe I should update my will, no it's ok I have time, I wonder if the radiation is killing the cancer cells or if their still in there resisting??? etc.etc.etc. Sometimes when I let my inside voice say outside voice things - people just look horrified - then I say something terribly witty and we all move on - maybe that's why my poor friends are avoiding me  Have a good weekend everyone and really glad you are almost there bennybear! Also so sorry you've had to go through this with your own battle but also with your brother. That's tough stuff!",

I just finished day 5 today and I am starting to feel a bit of tightening and see a little tightness and swelling in and around my collar bone and incision. I've been using aloe, emu oil and calendula ointment. I've been eating quite healthy and juicing - so I seem to have a lot more good energy than I did before cancer this is related to the massive improvement to my diet.   I've been walking to treatment and home again (about an hour and a half in total) and seem to still have energy to do that. THAT all being the good news  - here is where my problem lies - reading some of your very recent talk about being foggy etc.- that some of you feel may be related possibly to chemo and radiation, I must report - since diagnosis, I have managed to:  cut a chunk out of my thumb - now very numb and quite sensitive, rip the skin off my shin which has left a lovely purple scar, and spilled hot water on my leg while removing the lid of a travel mug to put a tea bag in the newly boiled hot water  and now have a large water blistered burn on the upper part of one leg (I am quite a sight) actually people should really run in the opposite direction from me to stay safe) I know my family keep reminding me to pay attention - I actually feel like a bit of a senior (no insult intended given it appears I may be approaching sooner than expected). Additionally, I forget regularly and today I went to pick up my sister at the airport at the right time but unfortunately a day early! I have a sense people in my life may soon begin to question if I may be deliberately trying to harm myself. At this rate I may not have a brain in 16 more sessions. Perhaps they are actually radiating my brain and not really my remaining breast tissue!  Susan - I read your post tonight and I am in awe! You are an inspiration - you seem to have found the right place in this thread because there are a lot of strong, amazing women on here who are doing whatever it takes to get their/our lives back. Welcome to all our new joiners! Hope your day is good tomorrow - I will be going to the airport! Better go check her email and make sure!!! Nighty night. ",

I definitely share the sore throat side effect with you but not to the degree you are experiencing -  sending healing thoughts your way. Karen - I too have had a few really sharp pains in and around my my tumor site this week - also in my arm pit area. They seem to happen after the radiation and then disappear as the day wears on. Eileen - I agree with Karen - we all need a place to land everyday and the degree to which we have been affected by cancer is irrelevant when it comes to needing support - though I do feel much like you about how much many of you have gone through compared to me and my heart goes out to you all. It also helps me put my complaining into perspective. Brenda - I bought emu oil in an independent health food store in Vancouver. I find it very oily and tend to use it at night with lotions and aloe throughout the day. Pat - you look great in your avatar - I bet it's so nice to start seeing your hair show up again. I can't imagine having to have gone through chemo first before radiation - I will try to follow your lead and celebrate the benchmarks. I do have the half tan tanned body thing going on - it's starting to look really funny. Julie - I'm so sorry you've had such a profound loss in the same year that you are battling this - I lost my mom to cancer 5 years ago and feel her presence in my life everyday - I know people say it gets easier but I miss her just as much today as I did when I first lost her. I hope you have people in your life who are supporting you the way she would have.   Thank-you to all the lovely women who are on this journey with me - may your skin and nipples give you no grief tonight.  Sweet dreams and good-night my cyber friends, Sonia ",

The techs gave me a recipe for the angry rash on my chest today - Boil 1 litre of water add one and one half tablespoons of salt to the boiled water stir till it is dissolved and cool to room temperature. Pour over a clean washcloth and place cloth on the irritated skin a few times a day - make a new batch each day. It has been quite soothing for the itchiness - though the salt is a bit stingy initially.  Thanks for the suggestion on how to take tamoxifen Marita. I will definitely give that a try when I start taking the pill - I'm thinking I will start next week after I finish radiation. It must be really tough to be going through this in a foreign country - I hope you have all the supports you need there.  I'm with you Donna - (glad to hear you are done with tx and recovering) couldn't agree more - would love to be chatting about anything other than treatment issues. It seems like this is all I talk about. I feel like a Debbie Downer with my friends and family.  Thanks for the positive words - I am glad to have nowhere to go tomorrow and am going to watch season two of True Blood this weekend as my diversion. Spendy - glad to hear someone say they aren't having side effects from tamoxifen. My mom took tamoxifen for 5 years and never complained about any side effects. I holding out for no side effects too!! Thanks for giving me hope.    Good-night ladies, Sonia ",

I've been trying to think about moving forward from here (wednesday when I finish rads) and letting go of what might happen in the future.  Marilyn, your post reminded me that I too will soon be back at work with all of those \"keep busy things\" on my schedule. Maybe that will be the exact diversion I need to keep that hungry worry ghost at bay. I am certain your staff are more than happy to pick up the slack - though my sense is you probably do way too much anyway. Livia it sounds like you have a wonderful support team and that your journey has been a very tough one - I've said before I just can't imagine doing chemo and radiation.  This has been a really long few months for me and it seems many months for some of you. I haven't had the same situation as many of you managing families, a job and treatments - being off of work for the summer I have had a lot of empty hours to fill and many of the people who love me seem to have gone back to their own lives (as they should) but I am a little lonely and a lot afraid for the future. It helps to read many of your positive posts to remind me that it is possible to get on with things. Thanks for the cheer Linda - I saw the Dr. I terrorized on Friday - I think when he saw me he had to work really hard to not run in the other direction ( I think I scare him )  Thanks to all of you who are here in the trenches with me. There is comfort in having companions in the \"same boat\". I am grateful tonight to have three treatments left. My skin is certainly ready to be done.  Sonia",

Today I am one week out from radiation and this is the first day that the itching hasn't gotten worse. I have been still having a bit of a sore throat off and on - almost like a tiredness in my throat. The darkness and sores are still there but I have a feeling I was a tiny bit better today - the swelling has also come done a bit. Do hang in there, I think things can only get better (thank god!!!).  Linda - your family sounds lovely. I'm so glad you are surrounded by love. Kim, glad you won't have the drive - I bet you won't miss that.  I've been struggling with this feeling - I wonder if others have felt this - it's this sense of having lost my freedom. I realize that the people around me who haven't had to face this - they have a carefreeness about them, a freedom and innocence - like nothing bad will ever happen to them. I just feel sad in a way and I'm having trouble putting my finger on what it is but it's like I've just discovered that I will never feel worry free again. I think the only way to describe it is as the loss of freedom. I feel like everyone feels sorry for me - without saying it - who am I kidding - I feel sorry for me. Think I need to go back to work - maybe that will help??? Donna and Brenda - reading your posts make me wonder if I am ready or not. Brenda, your comment about needing to learn your not in control really resonates with me - thats a tough one - I think that also relates to this fear feeling and sadness I'm having - tough lessons this cancer thing doles out - yuck!!!

Thank-you most especially for your comments and sharing around how this has changed you too! Brenda, what you said about observing and not participating really hit home for me. Sometimes I will be sitting in a room (tonight) with 20 people and feel completely alone - not at all in a bad way - but it is such a peculiar feeling -- just feeling like I live in a parallel universe to the one everyone else in my life lives in. I definitely feel like I am grieving - though I may seem like I have it together. I certainly feel like I protect everyone I love from those dark thoughts that come at 4 AM.  Kickon2it - what you said about cutting through fluff - it's so interesting to me how present I feel with myself - really for the first time in my whole life - I'm just so present in my body, feeling every itch, a complete awareness of what I must do to stay healthy, focused on what is good for me, what I can and cannot do anymore, trying to be true to myself and also to stop feeling like I have to take care of everyone else, just living in the present moment and like what so many of you said about not being able to focus on the future but actually trying to just live today. When I get really scared I ask myself \"are you ok right now?\" and \"are you dying today?\" and of course I am not -  I am trying really hard not to let myself spiral into those scary thoughts. You know Kim, I have that same feeling sometimes with my family, like they just don't want the details or they seem so shocked or confused by the details I've shared and they seem not to remember or they can't process what they know I've gone through - it seems easier for them not to know - maybe it's self-preservation? I'm not sure - but it kind of makes me go inside myself and disappear a little. I  think that's when this feelings of separateness / aloneness / 4 a.m. scared can come up.  Anyway, enough rambling and self-therapizing for tonight. Thanks for taking the time to be here - I know it is really important to me that you are. hugs and sweet dreams, sonia  I had Donny, the Osmond Brothers, Bobby Sherman and The Jackson 5 on my ceiling. Seems like a hundred years ago. ",

Kim - like Karen with her cabbage soup disclaimer - I am going to recommend some books but please look through them first as they may not be a good fit for everyone.   When I was first diagnosed I read two books that really helped/changed my feelings about what was happening to me \"What Matters Most - Living a More Considered Life\" by James Hollis PHD. I found the book very powerful and it helped me a great deal with my fear. The second book I was very impacted by was \"Close to the Bone - Life-threatening Illness and the Search For Meaning\" written by Jungian Analyst, Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen.  There were parts in the book that I found profound. She describes cancer as a liminal experience - something that changes us, initiates us into knowing something at a body level we never knew before and that when we have these experiences we are changed at a soul level. It has a lot of mythology, goddess, archetypal language in it so it isn't a book that will speak to everyone.  The books about food and diet that I have found very helpful are: Foods That Fight Cancer - Richard Beliveau and Denis Gingras. They are Canadian Cancer Researchers. I love this cookbook - The Cancer Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz with Mat Edelson. Hope you are all feeling ok - I really am growing to love you guys - hopefully we can stay connected Lickon2it and will meet on the tamoxifen thread too! Sonia ",

      "Content": "Aug 31, 2010 07:58PM - edited Aug 31, 2010 08:00PM by bailey1958 Hey Ladies, Had a great day out today - amazing how when I'm out shopping and spending money I rarely think about cancer. I am struggling to find things to eat since i have radically changed my diet since the beast arrived. I went out and bought a book on balancing hormones through diet called \"the hormone diet\" and also picked up a book called the China Study. I've been hearing a lot about it in the natural girls thread and decided I would look for it. It looks quite interesting.    Julie, it is unbelievable to me how unjust things can be - you seem to have had so many stressors in your life - I can't believe what a sense of humor you have - it is obviously what allows you to keep moving forward. You seem like a very strong woman. Brenda, how great that you have found a workplace where there is compassion for your situation and you can feel comfortable talking to others who have been in your shoes. It sounds like a really good place - I'm with you  - I think things come our way somtimes when we really need them.  Kim, sure wish I could help you with your Tamoxifen dilemma - I certainly know the feelings and fears you are having - I am also finding some of my hot flashes pretty toasty!!I also am still itchy - it does seem to be better each day but I am certainly still a ways away from \"NORMAL\"!!!  Hey Patty hang in there you are almost through. I remember the pain and itching in my collar bone. It has cleared up completely - though the area around my incision is still terribly itchy - but it does get better. I am working really hard on getting as many anti cancer foods in each day - it is the one thing that helps me worry less about re-occurance.The cookbook is a great one - it lists all the nutritious food we can eat and what each food does for our body. It is definitely helpful in understanding why nutrition helps keep rogue cells under control. Hang in there everyone. We are almost through this phase. Sonia ",

My skin is taking longer than I thought it would to peel. Trying to moisturize and be patient. As you said Deb, reading others process through the different treatment, side effects, emotional roller coaster really is so helpful. Julie and Patty hope you two are doing alright - bet you are looking forward to the weekend. Enjoy - even though i remember wanting to go straight through so i could get done. Donna I am interested in hearing about the embracing uncertainty book - lets us know what you think.  Really related to your comment Pat about the loss of unlimited future vision- the change in my focus has been enormous and the idea of the future and all that it holds seems so unknown now. I was thinking yesterday when I was looking through things I have kept for sometime in the future?? or when I think about getting a cat sometime in the future - that the future is here right now and if I want to do something, achieve something, go somewhere - whatever it is I want - it's time to do that and stop waiting for the future. I guess in a way it's also kind of freeing. Hope you all are doing well, have a safe and restful long weekend if your traveling (Pat).  Sonia ",

My daughter's were here visiting and we had a big birthday bash with friends and relatives given it was their 30th. My dad was very high maintenance but I survived and he is safely back in his own home. I feel as though I've so busy that I haven't been able to concentrate and focus on all of what has been happening in your lives. I'm relieved you had a clear bone scan Karen. I can imagine the weight of the wait and know when I have to wait for results I always feel sick and suffer stomach knots. I think about that a lot now knowing how each of the tests coming in the next few months are going to be accompanied by that feeling of fear.   Julie I am so sorry you aren't feeling well and all your preparations for your time with Jim are not going to be as fun because your sick. Get better and maybe you can spend the time curled up in bed with him resting and taking care of yourself. Also thank-you so much for sharing about your feelings for your mom when you were taking care of her. Sometimes I feel so mean saying what I do about my dad but he really is such a grumpy guy and revels in pushing people's buttons.Take care of yourself and enjoy what you can of your trip. Brenda - I am so sorry you are sick. All you said about stressing about work and being sick sounds really hard. I'm find myself getting lost or vague around things that I would never had a problem with before  - my attention to details has been lost.  Sometimes I feel like I am such a different person, I feel really raw and tender emotionally and feel like I care so little about things that used to be important to me. It's been really weird. Tracye - sending you cyber positives!!! Donna - when I read your line  mostly going through the motions - it completely resonated with me. I feel as though some things don't even get near touching me. I feel so distant from things - it's not a not caring feeling so much as it just seems like so many things are so unimportant anymore and then other things seem so meaningless. I feel so disconnected from people who were my friends. I talk to friends and I feel so far away from them emotionally. I feel so unseen by them maybe??? I'm not sure I can't seem to figure this all out yet. Sorry for being so rambly - it feels like I've been held hostage for weeks by aliens. Sonia ",

I went through what seems like a very similar situation with mom before I lost her 5 years ago. It was such a difficult time in my life so when I think about you going through cancer and supporting your mom it seems almost inhumane for anyone to have to deal with all of that. I wish I could fast forward to after your results so the wait was over - hang in there and try to take care of yourself. I know you're really worried about getting started on your pills but if I had to say life has changed much because of tamoxifen it would really be only an increase in hot flashes. Unlike you Karen I do worry that it is already growing back under the area where the margins weren't really clear because there was no other breast tissue to take - so although I am also dreading my breast MRI in December and scared I will have to do this again I feel like that is where I am going to run into trouble. It's awful  ins't it - that all of us have been through so much and now we feel a little like sitting ducks waiting for it's return. I guess in a way my busy ness helps me keep my mind off these thoughts. I don't have any pain like you're describing Kim but I have to say my itchiness is horrible - last night I could hardly sleep for the itching. Hope you all had a nice day. Talk to you soon. Sonia ",

My radiation oncologist was very negative about MRI's - I think the thing that I have learned in this process that has been the most surprising is just how imperfect the screening tools are (MRI, ultrasound and mammogram) and how critical it is they be used together in order for dense breast tissue to be really \"seen\" clearly. There really is no way around this - cancer sucks. ",

I have been sleeping better since the tiredness descended Julie - so sorry you are having such poor sleep. Kim - I have the little pimples all over the area being radiated too - they started in week two/three - they called them skin dermatitis and gave me betaderm for them. They haven't got worse but they also haven't got better. I imagine that will improve after radiation ends. I have also been getting more and more of those electrical currents and burning. The tiredness was really bad the last 8 sessions for me.  I met a little girl today who is 4 getting radiation. She has to be put to sleep before each of her sessions - her family looks exhausted and said it has been very difficult. What a nightmare. Made me feel like a whiner. I am imagining that for many of the rad techs - my journey does seem pretty normal compared to hers.  For those of you who have to take tamoxifen - which thread are you going to join?

      "Content": "Sep 6, 2010 09:25AM - edited Sep 6, 2010 09:26AM by bailey1958 Hi Everyone, Pretty quiet around here. I've had a busy weekend with company and preparation to go back to work. For those of you who are hitting the wall with poor energy - I had a B12 shot at my naturopath a week ago and I have to say it certainly seems to have given me more energy and I haven't hit the wall as some of you have described a couple of weeks after radiation. My skin continues to be itchy and the peeling is still apparent but the skin is mostly starting to look normal. Trish my DH has had a basal cell removed a couple of times from his nose and when they did the surgery it was a huge hole on his nose and took some time to heal but evidence is completely gone except when he gets sun on his face and the rest of his skins gets a bit tanned but his little spot stays quite white. I know it was worrisome to him and I when it happened but it really has been fine. My brother also had one and he has had no further trouble. I think the word - cancer has become so loaded with negative meaning that just hearing it feels like a death sentence. Hang in there!! I am reading \"The China Study\" as I have said earlier and there is some pretty crazy stuff in there that kind of freaked me out. First - he is a huge proponent of plant based food and says cancer, even once you've had it can be managed to a large degree by diet. There are multiple studies they have conducted and replicated that associates animal protein with an increase in cancer once it has been established in the body from exposure to some type of carcinogen exposure and says \"Foci growth could be reversed, up and down, by switching the amount of protein being consumed, and in all stages of development\" and that cancer insults to the body in a dormant phase can be reawakened to form foci with more that 20% animal protein ingestion. Bottom line of their studies - \"These studies showed that cancer development is modified by relatively modest changes in protein consumption....foci did not develop with up to about 10% protein ingestion ..beyond 10% foci development increased dramatically...\" For the experiments they used casein, which is made up of 87% cow's milk protein and when they did the study with plant protein it was not implicated at all. It is the best argument I've read so far for staying away from dairy and meat. It has been fascinating so far - sorry if I am boring you all with it but I wondered if any of you have read the China Study or if you have thoughts about this material. All of this said - I am still sitting here drinking coffee with cream - so hard to give it up. Hope you had a great weekend of healing and rest. Sonia ",

I will miss you all and your posts. My skin is almost done with the peeling and looks almost normal - though I do feel intense itching at times - especially at night. I am quite nervous that now we are all done you will all disappear into different threads and i won't be able to find you. I feel scared to be alone with my worries and it is a comfort to put them out here and have people respond. It's so weird that it's all over and you have to just go back to living. I guess I'll get back to NORMAL sooner or later.  Brenda - diamond earrings - yay!!! Good for you.  I wish you lived near me Kim, boy would it be nice to have any/all of you around - but that said Vancouver is a bit of a ways away from your corner of the USA. Take care all, Sonia ",

I was just reading about people's grieving rituals after the loss of a loved one and shed tears over the loss of my mom - again!! I feel like I miss her more each day and it's been five years - so I can only imagine the profound loss you feel right now.I agree with KIm - \"A\" or \"T\" who cares - you're with us - stay with us please - don't want to loose your great energy.  Spendy - I worry constantly about reoccurance - though I will not let myself search outcomes anymore. I feel scared but more than scared I think I feel really sad. I also feel like I've experienced the death of a part of me through this process and it feels like I am grieving for myself right now - so I can totally understand not feeling like celebrating Julie.  Claire - thanks for coming to check up on us and including us in how things unfold as time goes on. I agree with you Karen and Claire - finding someway to celebrate or mark this occasion seems really important. My daughters are flying me to meet them in San Diego this weekend to celebrate their 30th birthdays with them. They booked my flight and called me after - said they wanted to have me with them when they woke up on Sunday and to have me around to celebrate with that day. My sense is they are terrified I'm about to drop dead and won't be around forever to celebrate birthdays - but I feel so blessed and touched by their actions. Makes me feel a bit melancholy and worried I may not be around to see them have babies etc. I am on facebook - rarely go there but would if you all wanted to connect that way. Take care everyone - thanks for your support!!!",

Wherever she is in the afterlife - she has earned the prize for endurance (59 years of marriage). KIm I am with you, I actually feel some anxiety about cancer lately given every time I turn around there is some public service announcement regarding cancer. I hope it's over soon. I went to a party last night with a large group of people = most aware of what happened to me - it was also very weird - people look at me with such pity - it makes me sad - almost like I want to defend myself - so I start trying to convince them I am going to be ok. It really sucks. This has been a tough weekend that's for sure. I feel a lot of dread about the upcoming tests and doctor visits I will have to do in October. My surgical, radiated area is so itchy and it really has been 6 weeks since finishing. I am going to try and get all the tests and screening you all are talking about. Just hope things go well for all of us. I really have a knot in my stomach today - different than the numbness I was talking about - this is such a roller coaster. Enjoy your sunday - going to go find somewhere to hide in my one room loft apartment  ",

I feel as though my skin is more itchy now than it was a month ago. I have my followup this week with my radiation oncologist and I am really nervous. I feel after all the testing you are all having that I should be getting the tests on liver, eyes, cervix etc. etc. and kind of don't want to bring it up because I can't tolerate waiting for results. I can remember those days tracye of waiting with my eye on my cell phone for a call that felt like it would never arrive. Hang in there - am I ever sending all of you NO MORE NOTHING NO BAD EVER AGAIN thoughts. All your talk about sleeves is making me wonder about a trip I'm taking to India in November and if I should be thinking about that to. I think I will check with my radiation oncologist this week when I meet with her. Take care everyone. Sonia ",

I have discovered something positive that is happening that I realized in the shower today - my leg hair has stopped growing. I think that may be the most positive side effect ever. I've been really tired, emotionally drained by the end of the day and happy to get into bed early. Feel I have to actively work to keep the negative thoughts from creeping in. Having these intrusive thoughts that I won't share so I don't plant ideas in any one's head but really don't like some of my thoughts. I know for those of you who are contemplating counselling or support group, that I really have appreciated seeing a counsellor through this process. She is a cancer counsellor and she really does have astute and helpful things to say to me. If you are unsure - give it a try - you may actually find it really helpful to keep a handle on the depression. I am going to go walk on my treadmill - exercise is one of the things I am having the most difficult time incorporating into my life. YUCK. Take care friends. You give me strength to go on. Sonia ",

She said most women who see her after cancer have the same description and that there is a new book she thought called brain fog that describes the phenomenon and suggested I read it. She said they are no longer attributing this effect to chemo but in fact it seems to hit most people and they say there may a number of factors that could cause it including radiation, hormone treatment, the surgery, stress and perhaps even something that the tumor releases. Crazy! Have a great weekend everyone. ",

I have been doing a lot of research and reading and found a link to a research summary about nutrition that really spells in out. If any one is interested I've included the link  cancer.ucsf.edu/_docs/crc/nutr... I also found this article on dairy and why we shouldn't eat/drink it - if you have no interest in giving up the cream in your coffee - DON\"T READ THIS - http://www.rense.com/general26/milk.htm Tracye - I wish that I could say something profound that would help you with the situation you're in. I know when there was some talk that I may not be able to take tamoxifen and that I may have to \"loose the ovaries\" I felt pretty attached suddenly to them.  Hang in there. Julie - I hope you are surrounded by all the love and support you need during what is such a sad time. I miss my mom everyday - I think actually more everyday because each day without her that goes by just makes me miss her more. It's so hard at times when one of the most important people in your life passes and leaves a big hole where she once was - I will always miss my mom as I am sure you will too.  Welcome back Donna. So glad your trip was cancer free - that makes me look forward to my trip in November. It is nice to feel regular again - though those weird pains and itches could stop any time. Try not to worry too much about your skin tag/mole. My DH has them removed regularly being a freckled guy and it always surprises me how something so small can take 3 stitches to sew up.  I am certain it will be fine - he has so many and they always come back benign. Sending you good mole vibes. How have you been feeling Kim - I know you said you were feeling pretty blue - are things staying the same or are you starting to rebound?  Have a good week everyone - there is so much going on for all of you. Sometimes I talk about you to my friends, family, colleagues and they look at me like I'm loosing my mind. It goes something like this - \"one of the women I talk to online who has been through breast cancer like me says..........\" and they look at me like WHO?? are you talking too? You've become friends - seems strange not to know what you all look like but it really doesn't matter - maybe one day we will have to meet somewhere.   Sonia ",

Hopefully my brain damage from tamoxifen won't get in the way and I will remember who I am, where I'm going and how to get back to the airport or I won't have to worry about eating because will find myself lost after taking a wrong turn, get abducted and sold into the sex trade.

India was pretty crazy - very intense, chaotic, challenging, noisy, sad, and amazing. Hong Kong was a giant shopping mall but had an amazing experience there seeing a Giant Buddha and visiting a monestary. Had a number of incredibly cool experiences and saw amazing dieties from 7th century carved into cave walls, boat trip on the arabian sea,  beautiful temples, ancient cities. I kept thinking about how amazing it was that all these things exisited before us and how insignificant we all really are. Made me feel really grateful and lucky when travelling in India. In comparison to what women have to deal wth there - I felt really lucky. I ate anything I felt would be safe in India - absolutely no fresh vegetabels and fruit - didn't feel guilty but had to keep reminding myself that I wouldn't die of cancer from a couple of weeks of normal eating. Then, On the way home I started to have anxiety and am now feeling the chronic presence of it in my body. The triggar - I have a breast MRI on the 13th and feeling terrified. Mad that I let myself be roped into an appointment before Christmas and also feel like it will just be like the last one with areas that need to be checked out. Now that I've read about your recent mammo experiences -  I am feeling like I am going to have to deal with similar experiences - things hanging over my head for another 6 months. I have had no check-ups since finishing treatment and haven't had a mamo since diagnosis. I keep thinking I should be getting one but know that an MRI is more than enough. Do you guys think I should also get a mammo as well? God I hate this - I'm with you Karen - I HATE CANCER - please go away and don't come back - it really is such a downer. I just want to forget and just when I've started to feel better - I started to run into follow-up appointments in my day timer. I have a chronic knot in my gut.  I really missed all of you and I am so sorry to hear about your pain Tracye - I hope the procedure will set you up for less problems and that your health/body heals very soon. Glad to hear your reports are positive Kim. I know this stuff is really so hard for all of you - but thank-you for being here and being a part of my support team. I couldn't wait to get on here tonight and read your posts. Sending you all hello, thank-god your here hugs! Sonia ",

I really feel for all of you. I am hoping my olive skin, easily tanned skin will be ok but I think I may be in denial. You know it's only been day 2 for me but when they leave you in the room because it's unsafe for them to be in there - it is such an odd feeling - can't imagine this can be good for your skin and all I am hoping for is getting through without the skin breaking open etc. Leklovessrk - I think it is going to end up being much darker on one side of my chest than the other - sounds like tanning the other side may well be what I have to do too!! It must be really hard to deal with this with kids at home. How old are your kids?  Kim - I asked about the type of radiation I'm getting - it's called electron radiation and it spreads out like a flashlight they said so the actual area it covers is similar to yours 8X7.. They said the same thing to me about that pad thing - but they are putting on my everyday - horrifying really!!! I think it would be better to be in denial - ask less questions and just be surprised by what happens.   hoist123 - so sorry you have to go through this again - how are you doing with this - have the treatments changed much in 10 years?  Spendygirl - so sorry you've had all the crappy side effects you've had. I had a hematoma after my breast reduction surgery and remember my breast being much more tender than the other breast - have some numbness that never went away on that side too - always chalked it up to having a huge hematoma that had to be drained 2X. ",

Hope all your swelling, chaffing and irritated parts are not getting worse. It's interesting how many of my friends who I thought would be with me all through this have kind of lost interest???  I feel as though more than anything people are kind of scared and it's easier to just see me as strong and getting on with it - and so they seem to think things are all back to normal. It's hard to be vulnerable with them and let them know how scary it is to be in my head sometimes and how hard it is to have fears about the future - get lots of comments like - don't worry everything will be fine!!.   Hindimetfan - I've got lots of crazy comments too! Sometimes it's just easier to keep it surface to avoid everyone's uncomfortable, though I'm sure well intentioned remarks. How old are your twins Patty? I have twin 29 year old daughters - they've been wonderful and so supportive. I, like you have enjoyed having them around to have some fun with this summer though they have just left to go back to work. Hope you are all well - good luck tomorrow - then two days off!!! Yay - the weekend. Sonia ",

It's weird - today I kept thinking - I wonder if anyone else in here (25 women plus 4 men) have had cancer, do they all have their breasts or have they had to have mastectomies, can they see my incision, I wonder if they can tell there is something different about me (we've been in a training program for a year together) I've lost some weight and one of the women asked me yesterday if I had been pregnant OMG  - I wanted to blurt - nope just cancer! But  I contained myself - it just felt like it would be way too horrible of me. Pagowens - love the aloe straight out of the fridge onto the breast tissue - nice and cool - though my skin is so numb it takes a bit before I feel it.   Take care of yourselves warrior/super women, you are fighters, gritty awesome and inspirational to me - thank-you for your stories tonight - I am not really talking about this with anyone anymore except my wonderful guy but it's this place we've created together, that is my safe place to land in at the end of a day of keeping it all in inside of me - it helps me so profoundly.

      "Content": "Dec 11, 2010 07:29PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:23AM by bailey1958 You guys are so amazing. Thanks for the great support, the hugs, words of encouragement and holding me in your thoughts. I am definitely back to waking up and having trouble getting back to sleep. Lots of anxiety dreams. Tracye - I certainly feel my breast is still swollen - and much of it is along the side of the breast below where I had my sentinal node biopsy. If I feel it long enough it feels like a circular area that I can start to feel panic about. My breast is definitely a bit bigger on the treated side. I am glad the MRI will look at both my breasts. I am due for my yearly mammogram but I've decided this test should be sufficient. I will check that out on Monday. I have a follow-up appointment early January to see my breast surgeon and I have also decided to request a referral to a medical oncologist (not sure if that's what they're called) - I currently see a radiation oncologist but I am thinking quite seriously about shutting down my ovaries and changing to an aromatese inhibitor instead of tamoxifen. I was reading a study that said with my type of cancer it isn't as effective - so I want to talk to someone about this. I was quite concerned about endometrial cancer as a side effect but there is a doctor who has been working in the area of breast cancer treatment who has said in an article I was reading that since the 80's he has only seen 3 women develop endometrial cancer - that made me feel relieved but I want to find out more about the tamoxifen/lobular cancer issue. I hadn't heard that tomoxifen reduces breast density Kim, I am the queen of dense breasts - I've been taking iodine since July and it is also supposed to reduce density - I guess I will find out soon enough if it has worked for me - but if it hasn't for those of you with dense breast tissue - likely it won't have made any difference. I think the holidays have also had a negative effect on me -  it is a time of year my mother loved and it just hasn't been the same since she died. I think with everyone getting tests and results right now it is a bit of a downer. I used to read the obits after my mom was diagnosed with cancer and feel overwhelmed if there was anyone who was her age or younger. I avoid them now at all costa - though I feel like all anyone ever talks about is cancer -on the news, in the staff room - it makes me feel crazy.  I am happy to be going away with my guy for Christmas - we are meeting my daughter's in Palm Springs - going to lay around the pool, read, hike and ride bikes - and shop. I have 3 weeks off for Christmas and I am hoping this test doesn't interfere with any miserable results. I think you are all so amazing and it is because of you guys coping with these wait and see results  - I realize I will have to try to accept any results I get as gracefully as the rest of you have done. I think I will try and read \"picking up the pieces\" sounds like something I need to check out - thanks for the suggestion Brenda.    Thanks again everyone, Sonia ",

I feel as though I have to be normal or everyone starts looking at me (when I'm being honest or say anything about my treatments)  like I might die at any moment - they all have those eyes that say how sorry they feel for me. Makes me feel like crying so it's easier just to act like all is well. - but have to say - feeling a bit vulnerable tonight - me and my cancer - hope this radiation is killing it all - don't like feeling this way. Feeling pretty alone - even in a houseful of people. Glad you're on this board. You make me feel more normal.  Sleep tight! Sonia ",

I feel like so many people in my life are so distracted by their lives - and inside my head I feel so intense and life seems so immense right now.

I know it gets better because it already has  - but the realization that so much in my life has changed and the people in my life really have no idea how difficult this is - and some days like today, I just feel so mad at everyone for having their life of distractions when no matter how hard I try, I just can't be/nor do I want to be distracted by the things that used to be important to me. I feel like I am in the middle of this huge life change and I am doing it all alone - kinda scary. I realize I'm probably being a bit melodramatic and should probably go get some sleep.

It was awesome!    No news on the MRI Karen - I don't expect anything until next week - I have been really busy and I am reading the picking up the pieces book - section on fear has helped - trying to stay in the present.

She just reeks anger - I told her when she asked how I was managing that the only people who I really talk to is you guys cause it seems like no one really understands the daily coping required. She asked if I thought I would ever stop worrying and I said I didn't think so.  I'm sorry to hear about your having to deal with truncal LE Kim and Donna.

My day was good for the soul - hope you all had a nice day too! I appreciated hearing from some of you on your experiences with the Doctors you've had treating you through your healing process . My sense is many doctors are very specialized in their areas of expertise and many just don't have the time, the resources, nor perhaps even the inclination or interest in learning more about alternative ways to approach healing from cancer.   Certainly I would think a holistic approach to recovery, including immune system boosting, recovering from the standard treatments for cancer - surgery, radiation and chemo and including the next five year journey of hormones many of us are going to be on, would be a part of their plan for us. It seems that the standard treatments for cancer kick the shit out of everyone and I think it's really important to develop a plan to continue the process of recovery. It is stunning to me that many Doctor's just don't have up to date knowledge about many alternative treatments including but certainly not limited to nutrition, exercise, supplements, meditation, associated deficiencies or imbalances etc. I have been so inspired by the many women on these boards who are so well read about cancer recovery and have used research to make decisions going forward in their lives. Whether the doctor's I meet are able to answer my questions about alternative ways to support myself health wise or not, I thank goodness there are so many women on here who have provided me with a ton of knowledge, resources and ideas about how to go forward in a way that allows me to at the very least feel like I have something positive I can focus on. I feel like the only way I am going to be able to move forward in my life in a \"normal\" way is to at the very least, feel like I am doing as much as possible to get well and STAY WELL. I think the most difficult thing for me to overcome is this belief that the medical model of health is the best one. Although I am really grateful that the treatments I've had are available to me, based on what I am reading, there are a lot of alternative things I can do to get healthy and stay healthy so I can support my body to keep cancer away. I know there are many women who have re-ocurances and if I have to prepare to deal with that on my journey than I want to be as healthy as I can so I am able to deal with what might be a chronic illness for me - God forbid - knock on wood!!. One thing is for sure 13 treatments of radiation down - I don't plan on cancer being my life story. I am going to do whatever makes sense and is manageable to make sure this stupid illness never comes back! Stay strong cyber friends - we can get through this! Thanks once again for all the support this past week - it was a tough one and I am anticipating more tough days ahead. Sonia ",

In all seriousness, I felt about five minutes of relief after the MRI and now I feel as though the serial killer is just waiting in the wings again. I had a long session with my counsellor yesterday and was telling her yet again about my mood swings and she was really reassuring - she works with breast cancer survivors (I hate that word) and says all the women including those of us who have not had chemo but been through treatment and are now on tamoxifen/AI's describe similar feelings, fogginess, tiredness, and in fact a woman who was finished her tamoxifen for five months was in her office and described feeling like herself for the first time in five years. I have to say, although I was horrified I could actually feel this way for five years - I was relieved there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.

I have been trying to convince myself that I can handle the next five years of tamoxifen and I will handle the SE's just like I have managed the \"idea\" of radiation being aimed at my body 21 times while everyone else waits outside the room in their safe zone. I am presently directing my anger, frustration and sadness toward all Doctor's who say things like \"you need to relax\" (about tamoxifen) and who ask to see the underside of my breast when my breast isn't being radiated for the second time in two weeks (my radiation oncologist is away and the doc covering is so patronizing he makes me want to spit). UGGGGGG I actually think I scared him today when I refused to allow him to look at my breast and requested a referral to a medical oncologist because I was unhappy with the fact I have only seen my radiation oncologist once and said that I needed to speak to someone who could answer my questions given he couldn't and that I needed to have a relationship with the people who were going to be included on my support team.. I must say - I am actually enjoying my anger today.  Hang in there \"women in arms\" we will overcome. (god I'm long winded!)",

Wow. Felt like he was in my head.   Thoracic Surgery It was like jumping with full consent into an empty well so deep I only remember falling in the dark till falling without direction put me to sleep. Then I woke broken and battered with no memory of impact. Ever since, it\u2019s been Impossible to let go and I tire and ache. When I do sleep, I wake with this shoulder burning or that flank of muscle bound or the veter- brae in my neck locked. Afraid to let go. Never knowing how or if I\u2019ll wake. And true, the trauma and pain echo smaller and smaller. But I\u2019ve had to redefine normal like putting grit in paint. For to breathe is sore; to inhale, in-sore; to exhale, out-sore; to dream, bright and sore. And now after 12 injections of morphine and 180 capsules of codeine, I fear the unanesthetized days. Now I\u2019m told a side effect is depression\u2014the heart grown sore. Now I must strip the medicine like clothes. The depression, like a zippered cloud around my head. Must nakedly with full consent jump back into the world. Everyone\u2019s saying\u2014 C\u2019mon. Let\u2019s go. But I entered this and nothing\u2019s been the same. How can I jump on out and not fear the world is a broken cage?",

The fears are so hard to deal with - I can sure understand why you feel worried. Brenda I bought the Mark Nepo book and I'm finding many of his metaphors helpful. Just got started and I'm trying to catch up to do a reading for each day so I can sit with some of his thoughts. Karen, your news makes me feel like I should go get checked. My eyes feel a little blurry quite regularly - I've been thinking I need to get a check up.. I hope it's nothing for you and certainly hope it's just normal aging for me too!! Good luck with your exchange Chicago. I've been thinking lots about reoccurance - oh wait what's new with that.??? I feel like it's chronic right now. Maybe because I have a bunch of doctor's appointments this month.  It just never seems to end. Hope you guys are getting through this better than me - I am so SICK of my thoughts.

Kim - your lorazepam is Ativan - take it tonight - try it out - seriously even if you take it a few times over the next couple weeks or so you will be fine - addiction can happen but not if you are taking it very irregularly and very short term. The sleeping pill I take - I cut in half and when I take it the following couple of days after i also sleep really well. My sister who is a sleeping pill expert (30 years of insomnia) agrees that this also happens for some reason - ask your doctor for one of the new ones that doesn't leave you drowsy in the morning. When I take a half I swear I sleep 6 or 7 hours uninterrupted which is very unusual for me even in the best times. There is a possibility of rebound insomnia when you start using them regularly and once you stop you can have difficulty sleeping - but again as long as it is just short term and irregular I have a sense you'll escape being an addict. I realize I must sound like a pill pusher - I am actually very anti pill but I feel like this is a really difficult time and if there is a time to do it - certainly cancer/radiation qualifies -especially given how uncomfortable our bodies are right now.  Sonia ",

I had a full day out today and didn't reapply till tonight and actually can say i wasn't really itchy - YAY!! Things are getting better but my skin is still really dark. Linda, I feel sad that your girls are both away for school and you are feeling so bad. I know how you feel - mine travel for their work and couldn't spend a lot of time with me through this - they both have been feeling really bad - my sense is your daughters were probably really glad they could be there to support you all summer.  It will be thanks-giving before you know it and you also have the rest of forever to spend some fun and quality time with them, Karen, I also had David Cassidy - in fact loved him too. I have read the anti cancer book - really liked it and found it very helpful. Have you read Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips? It is written by a very inspiring much younger woman than me but it is a delightful, laugh out loud at spots, very good book. Lighter somehow but just as good. I also have read some others i would recommend if you are interested in others. Here's my story of the day:  I was out trying on some new clothes for the start of the school year (work in a school) and the sales clerk was adjusting my top as i came out of the change room and saw my scar and radiation sunburn - she looked horrified and said \"did you just have surgery?\" followed immediately with \"do you have breast cancer - my husband is a radiation oncologist.\" I felt horrified and said \"yes actually\" - she looked overwhelmed and I said \" I am a bit uncomfortable with a lower cut top - kinda feeling like I want to cover up my scar until it heals\" and her response to me was \"I think you have more serious things to worry about than that\" I actually didn't know how to respond in the moment (radiation brain) and left the store even though I really liked two things but couldn't pull myself together to buy them. Sometimes people are just so helpful at helping contribute to those crazy scary worries I can think of on my own without any help from them. My DH who was waiting for me was horrified.  Hang in there dear cyber friends, Hugs to you all, Sonia ",

Not frustrated at all. It may have happened because in it I threatened to terminate my father by suffocation while he sleeps (he is here visiting me) and as a result my karmic penance is to have to start over. My 87 year old dad is perhaps the orneriest, healthiest and grumpiest human being on earth and he just spent the evening revelling in how he drank(alcoholic) his whole life, over ate, smoked three pack of cigarettes a day for years and somehow has managed to outlive everyone and now he has to be a pallbearer at everyone's funeral. If I don't suffocate him by Monday I may very well loose my mind.  My weekend was awesome, my daughter's are both lovely, generous, sweet and funny. They entertained and cared for me all weekend and I was able to forget cancer - though of late I feel like I am in some kind of fog. It's the strangest feeling - it feels a bit surreal almost like I'm floating through my life - I feel disconnected, almost like I am outside my body watching me live. I am really sorry for all of you and all you are going through right now and what you have gone through to find yourself here on the cancer path with me. I wish this hadn't happened to any of us. On days like today I wonder if I will die and my dad will out live me too. I wish I could leave this all behind and go back to the life I used to have. It's strange how joy is different now. Everything is different now and I feel as though the before Sonia is AWOL and all that's left is this weird feelingless Sonia. I don't feel like much of a survivor - certainly don't feel like I'm cured - mostly I just feel numb - both inside and ironically out. I am accident prone, forgetful and feel as though I've become my children's kid they have to feel sorry for, take care of and worry about. I will try for more positivity tomorrow. S",

She says if I am too low she will have to take me off of tamoxifen because it is one of the negative side effects of Tamoxifen. Then I will need to have my ovaries shut down with injections because my body is still producing too much estrogen for the post menopausal aromatase inhibitors to be effective for me. Once that is done my ovaries would no longer be producing estrogen. I'm not quite sure what to feel about this. The good news is that the side effects for the AI's are heart and bone issues rather than more cancer and blood clots you can get from tamoxifen. Oh will the fun ever end? I've feel like I've finally accepted my fate with tamoxifen so I'm not sure what to think. I guess it is what it is and whatever is decided I just need to accept. Not liking this - just saying!

I am starting to hate the way I feel with tamoxifen. I have been having a lot of aches and pains - joints aching, muscle aches, loosing hair, tons of hot flashes. Are any of you having these kinds of side effects? I swear the longer I'm on this gross drug the more seriously bad I feel. It makes me feel really old and achy. I've been considering talking to my Doctors about going off. I wonder what % of decreased risk I have given my stats.  Sometimes feel like my fear of endometrial cancer is growing. Wonder if I would be better off to have my ovaries shut down and not take anything. Feeling pretty miserable at times and when I read women are having re-occurances even with it - it makes me feel a little crazy. Wonder what I am doing to my body.",

I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you to loose your sister, your mom and have cancer in one year - I'm glad Jim is there taking care of you. I remember trying to get through my mom's things right away after she died and to be perfectly honest - I wish I could have given myself permission to do it when I was more ready and not in the throws of grief. I think we may have done things differently but my dad wanted her things gone immediately. Take your time with these things Julie, time allows you to process things differently. Chicago - you have every right to have a meltdown - your are trying to deal with a complete transformation that has happened to your body and your husband is so likely unable to understand how profound this is to you that his response to it is to minimize this because he has no idea how to help. I don't think men's brains are capable of understanding how much women are impacted by the loss of their breasts, and their hair. I think breasts and hair are so attached to our feelings about ourselves, the media and our culture put such an emphasis on them and so to have to deal with this complete change in who we are takes time. I have had so many meltdowns in the past months - although I'm sorry you are feeling bad I am grateful you shared because it certainly helps me to realize I'm not the only one struggling with the changes in my body/aging in my case and feeling old and achy. I think until something happens like this to men - loose the symbols of their maleness - oh wait isn't that why they have mid life crisis' and buy fancy cars and have affairs??? they can't really understand. My guy has been great but he doesn't always get it - I'm mean he wears the same version of the same t'shirt everyday - just a different color.",

I am getting ready to leave for a few days and really looking forward to the change in venue. I haven't heard anything about my MRI as of today but I am in cue for a diagnostic mammgram and ultrasound anyway - so it won't be over for a few weeks. Trying to get used to this uncertainty. I read the Stage three thread of women who are checking in with NED after five years. It was very inspirational. I am trying really hard to use the suggestions in the book I'm reading so all in all hanging in there. I am trying real hard to think like you Julie - lucky it was early. I have to say though - I wonder if no matter what you have had done Chicoago, you think you should have done something different - just to be sure. I was thinking about that reading the stage three thread \"well if only I had got chemo - then maybe I wouldn't be so worried\". When I saw the on call Dr. to get referred for the mammo she said during the course of our conversation \"tamoxifen is your chemo\" - I think it is making me resolved to stick with it.   Brenda - do it! You have completed the most challenging thing of your life and I think you deserve the time off to recover and discover - maybe that's what we all need - I really am trying to figure out who this new person is that is inhabiting my body.   Karen - I think Tai Chi sounds great - my mother in law does it and dance classes (she's 76) loves them both. I think I am going to try mindfulness meditation after the break - I wonder if I should go to boxing classes instead - maybe rouse my fighter.  Kim, I spoke to my Dr about the risk for endometrial cancer and she said she would send me for a baseline endometrial ultrasound that measures the lining so if there are changes that fall out side of normal ranges they can then check. Have any of you had one of those? Chicago - I interested in hearing about what you decide about shutting down your ovaries - are you on tamoxifen as well? Would you then do both? Well off to do some baking.  I have definitely not been sweating the food thing right now - I am so well behaved all the time it feels really ok to eat a little outside the box. Hope you are all keeping warm. ",

Decided I needed to know - no matter what the result was. They had me sign a release of information and handed it over. My relief is immense - no radiological evidence of malignancy identified, no enhancing lesions in either breast and no evidence of lymphadenopathy in all regions (I think that means my lymph nodes are all normal looking. YAY!!!!!  Thank-you for all your love and support. I am going to eat sugar to celebrate. I am off to Palm Springs tomorrow - so I am wishing you all a restful and love filled Holiday. I know we have all been through so much and for today and the next week I am vowing no cancer rumination. I hope all of you can do that too!

Was the book worthwhile?  Chicago - I had an MRI before surgery - there was an area that lit up and required a f/u ultrasound where they couldn't find anything suspicious. I believe it was the radiation oncologist who decided to order the MRI for my six month check-up and it was booked right after the ultrasound I had in July - I wonder if it was because my concerns about my tumor were ignored for two years and then there was this false positive that required the f/u ultrasound and she may have sent me just to be thorough and close the door on any further concerns. I will ask when I see her in February if it is protocol at the BC Cancer Centre to do a f/u MRI at 6 months. I feel really frustrated for those of you who would like to have one and are being put off. When my surgeon went over the result with me - she said I should feel relieved but she also feels the mammo and ultrasound are important to get as well though.  They all see something different is what she said. I am not sure if I will ever let anyone biopsy me again. I agree with you Donna about active recovery versus this emotional rollercoaster we are on. Sometimes I feel just downright crazy - I think I was a lot more focused when I was in active treatment. I also feel like tamoxifen is turning me into a shriveled old woman - shriveled up/parched batwings, muffin tops and butt - it's just not very pretty is it?  ",

I am from Canada and it seems my treatment is different than those of you from the USA. I have been told I will have 16 treatments with 4 boosts to the tumor site - my tumor was very high on my chest wall where very little breast tissue exists and as a result my surgeon couldn't get a clear margin - so the boosts are to ensure this area gets \"cleaned up\".  I am feeling a bit nervous about not having a OncoType test but if I choose to pay or join a study I can get one. I am feeling a bit conflicted about what to do. Everything I read about my highly receptive ER+++ tumor suggests that the hormone therapy is the best course of action. Do any of you have any thoughts about that?",

I feel pretty overwhelmed and vulnerable today - I think going to the cancer centre just really makes everything so real and scary. I sure hope my surgeon and radiation oncologist's lack of concern about the MRI are correct but that said I was also told my initial lump was nothing to worry about and it turned out to be cancer. I think I need someone to give me a slap to snap me out of this. Oh the waiting game - I just hate it.",

I am so glad you had such a wonderful healing trip to the mountains Brenda, I know that feeling of healing and connection when you are in the mountains, having grown up in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. I agree with all you said and everyone else who have been so supportive over the last few days - this is a hard path and one that not everyone can see -especially because we are all trying so hard to not let this own our lives and also trying so hard to make it ok so our loved ones don't have to worry about us.  Donna, what are you doing today instead of going to radiation? I'm sure it will be really strange to just go back to regular life without an active event each day to fight cancer, but - I agree with what others have said - our recovery is about taking good care of ourselves, making changes in those things that may require changes in order to stay healthy. I know I have been focusing on really taking care of myself for the first time in my life, actually feeding my body in a healthy way, taking time to rest, letting people know when I can't do something and not feeling guilty - allowing myself to just slow down and be present - really appreciating what is good in my life. This journey really has been so life changing. I, in so many ways feel profoundly lucky. Today I am trying to refocus on remembering that recovery isn't a goal but a process.  Have a good day today everyone,    Sonia",

They said they couldn't get a clear margin there because there was no more breast tissue left to take out. My radiation is now - as of today 21 treatments - 20 to go. They were going to do 16 with 4 boasts but now they will all be considered the same - no boasts. They said today that I will have a higher dosage because they had to pull the machine further back from my body in order to not have it running into my face - they also strapped this jelly pad to my chest \"to fool the machine into thinking there is more flesh there\" - didn't understand?? I think the area they are radiating is about 5X4. The actual radiation was 50 seconds but I was told that I wasn't getting standard xray radiation but another kind - can't remember right now what they called it but I will ask again tomorrow. Feel a bit weirded out by the fact my treatment is so different than everyone elses treatment. I also feel a little scared they aren't radiating my breast even though my breast wasn't anywhere near the tumor site.  ",

I definitely felt really tired last night after treatment #6 - and still that way this morning. I do think I am starting to feel the effects though the weather is very warm and I think that is contributing to feeling a bit lethargic My skin hasn't discolored but it does feel a bit tight - much like after my surgery too Kim. Just want to say, this is a lot to manage - try not to be too hard on yourself about not doing mothering perfectly right now.  I'm really interested to hear about your mammosite radiation Michelle. It will be so great to have it done in a week. I think that is what is so daunting about this part of the treatment - it just seems to go on forever. Sounds like the run in August will be a bonding and supportive experience for you.  My sister is here and it is really nice to have the emotional support right now - I hope all of you are well and doing something nice for yourself everyday. Have a good day.  Sonia ",

I find this is the best place for me to get information, Had a doctor check-in this week - my radiation oncologist is on holidays and the doctor covering for her wasn't able to answer any of my questions - after a series of questions about hormones and the research I've been doing to find answers about balancing my hormones he said \"you just need to be happy - that will give you the best chance\", I actually started to cry and he apologized for \"making me sad\". I was actually quite frustrated and felt a bit patronized - all in all he wasn't able to answer my questions. I sure will be glad when this part is over 13 down - 8 to go.

I am soooooo tired - was in bed for 13 hours last night something I haven't done since I was a teenager (a long time ago). My skin is covered in heat rash - the good news is one more today and three more next week and I am done this part of the journey. Once again I want to say to those of you who have done chemo before radiation - you must be the most courageous and strong women because I just can't imagine what that must be like. I consider myself a very strong person - but I tell you this is kicking the crap out of me this week. I was told yesterday that the effects from radiation peak a week after finishing (oh joy, oh bliss). I considered telling them today that I want to quit. What difference does it make if I do three less - but I know I have to finish given I have come this far. I also have had a headache for a couple of days - I wonder if it is just the heat or if any of you are getting headaches? Thanks for the suggestions Julie about hot flashes. I personally live with a fan attached to the end of my bed. It slays me how your skin can feel cold and the inside of you is on fire. Hormones - too much cause cancer and yet to little of them to regulate my body - it just doesn't make sense to me. Have a good day everyone. Thinking of you all - helps me keep going. Sonia ",

I haven't been poking around for the the last week and so haven't been up to posting - I'm just so tired and sleeping 12 hours every night and it just doesn't seem enough. I am feeling tired of things too. TIred of working so hard, tired of the endless chatter and meaningless stuff. I could go on but I won't. I am feeling much calmer about things in my life - that is  until I read a thread a few days ago about one of the women on this site who had a reoccurance after 4 years - pretty much my stats  and it has really freaked me out. I am having a terrible time with my thoughts again. I realize I shouldn't read things that I know will upset me but I find my empathy for everyone here over rides my common sense and sense of self-protection. I think when that happened this week it made me avoid the site for days. I feel like sometimes I am much better when I don't come here but then I miss you all and I want to know how everyone is doing and I feel like I can't stay away in case there is something you say that I might need to know. It's like I can't live with the information and can't live without it. I know when I just come to this thread I do really well but I obviously didn't stick to that rule this last time. I am finding so much comfort in what you say - about work, how family is treating you, what you're going through - it just is so helpful and so important to my healing. I am going to try to just connect here and on the tamoxifen thread - So glad to have caught up with you - read all your posts.My heart goes out to all of you. Sonia ",

I will be looked at in every possible way - so I am just assuming something will come back with a similar result to all of your birads 3 which I haven't heard used in Canada.  I am really trying to let go of all my fears - if there is something to find then so be it - let them find it, so I can get on with getting rid of it. I thought while I was at it I mays as well do a pap and go to the dentist. My gums are receeding, my memory is shit - as I see it, I may have early onset alzheimers and won't have to worry about anything. Brenda - I've started \"Picking up the Pieces\" and I am actually going to try to get started with the daily reflection questions and mindfulness walking once I finish work on Thursday and then I can focus on picking up the pieces in my own life. I think it may be really helpful. I think it's easy to focus on the fear and worry but the questions really force you to see that you do have a lot of other things going on and not all negative. I've realized that I have been so focused on getting on with my life but in the initial reading I'm doing - I realize figuring out how I've been changed and then how I move forward as this new person I am going to discover and define may be a good focus for me. I also have started looking for a course in MIndfulness Meditation to start in the new year.  I am so sick of worrying. I am determined to enjoy the holidays. I so sorry I complain so much, blah, blah ,blah about myself - I would be sick of me if I wasn't me cause I am sick of me being me. I am really going to try and be less whiny.

I know that feeling of surging anger - while having what seems like a concious voice deep inside saying \"good god what am I doing\" but not being able to stop yourself. I had one of those in the grocery store with my DH who stood patiently staring at me in horror while I freaked out and people were walking by with their carts of grocieries. I completely lost my mind and could not stop. It makes me laugh now to think about it.  I have found the book really kind of helpful - I think you guys might like it - it really does a good job of putting things into perspective - don't you think Brenda? Chicago I haven't had a period for three years - but my doc says my hormones were still in perimenopausal levels when tested. Given the night sweats and hot flashes it is hard to believe I have any hormones left. I'm really glad to hear your appointment went well - it nice to hear your results were good. You know Brenda, your so right about people just not realizing how hard this is. I really had no idea what a heavy thing it is to have this hanging around no matter how much we are encouraged to just get on with our lives.  Kim, I found the lobular cancer/tamoxifen article in one of the threads in the lobular cancer threads - I will go look for it and PM you with the link. Thanks for the encouragement Karen, I do feel entitled to be a bit whiney but it gets old really quick. I just wanted to comment about taking time off to go through this. My timing was impecable - I was finished school for the summer when I went through treatment. I just can't imagine how you have coped with working, treatments and recovery - Donna is right - take care of yourselves. This is a tough time of the year - everyone feels excited about holidays, are eating decadent meals/baking/chocolate constantly, it feels as though everyone is trouble free and there is a lot of pressure to feel good, lucky etc. I'm not going to lie - it's kind of a stretch right now for me to feel happy and that makes me feel guilty too. In the Picking up the pieces book there are quotes from lots of people of different ages and it is actually a relief to read other people's words. we have been through a tough year - I'm with you all - bring on 2011.",

I discovered something about myself this week. Had a tough one at work with a situation that normally I would have ruminated about for weeks and let it make me feel really bad, lose sleep over and just generally beat myself up over. I started out having what would have been a typical response to a challenging situation and then I found myself in the middle of it and realized that I just didn't care about it and that my need to prove myself was gone. I have this sense of calmness and I've had this distinct realization how little importance something I would have thought before cancer was terribly important is now post cancer just not. I am stunned by people's insensitivity and disconnection from their lives - I feel like people just race aimlessly through life blind to the things that really matter. I feel like I have to reevaluate my work life. I also have realized how much more I want real, authentic connection with people and yet I am surrounded by people who aren't awake. Weird stuff going on for me. I don't work Friday so I am really grateful I have three days off to get a break from a mid-life post cancer crisis. Thanks to all of you for giving me a place to be real and a group of people who make me feel normal (sorry Julie).",

My health is fine thank-you very much - I feel bitchy about this - it's weird I want sympathy but when they give it I don't like how they give it. I feel like I must seem so grumpy. I have my follow-up tomorrow with my radiation oncologist - if I could remember what I wanted to ask my doctor I would feel better about the possibility that it would be a worthwhile endeavor and not a waste of time. I guess the good news is that I still have time to remember. Maybe I will remember before my appointment.  Right - my memory - I need to ask why I suddenly can't remember anything, speak fluently without stuttering and constantly forget to put stuff in my calendar. Don't worry KIm it could be worse - at least you still know you're forgetful. NIghty night, Sonia ",

It just doesn't seem fair you have to start with tests and Doctors again - it's really a nightmare - hang in there. Don't forget that most findings are benign.  I am full of fear about having to deal with what you are dealing with - my thoughts are with you and I am sending you loads of good thoughts.  Tracye -  I totally understand why you don't want to go and think you shouldn't do anything you don't want to - hello - you have just been through at least two terrible traumas and now have to deal with a very sore ankle and all that will entail. You could say: 1) I am having an issue with my ankle and Doctors have recommended I not attend - period. 2)Personal reasons - no explanation. 3)I don't want to and you can't make me!!!!! I work in a school and have only told a few people. If you don't want to explain or inform your colleagues - you don't have to. Although people may stare at you like they do me when I pick the cheese off my pasta wondering if I have an eating disorder and although I want to shout I just had cancer and I'm trying to avoid reoocurrance by being psycotic about what I put in my body - I opt for them believing I have an eating disorder and not having to deal with all the questions, sad eyes etc. By the way - I was diagnosed with arthritis when I had my bone scan.  It is in both my wrists and I have to say I was relieved and happy when I heard the diagnosis!!! So sick but understandable given our situation. Chicago - anger sounds extremly healthy to me - it is terrible you've been through breast cancer and that you are staring your mortality in the face at age 32 when you should be living a carefree life. Be f$%^ing mad - it feels good and you've earned it!!!  ",

Cream was the most difficult thing I had to give up but I feel so relieved that I am not putting any estrogen into my body deliberately, it feels like a relief to have finally given it up. I am finding the reading I am doing about meat and dairy repulsive - I can't believe it took me this long to really understand how much impact my food choices have on my body. Hope you are ok Donna.

I feel like I've had a bit of a breakthrough this week - I think I am just realizing just how big what we've been through this year is and I think I am in some sort of transition right now - I think the ringing in of a New Year is going to be helpful. Told my guy that even though everyone else feels like I am great and fully recovered that isn't how I feel - I think he was shocked - he has in a way resumed his life too. It's funny how badly everyone wants us to be ok and that if you look back to normal then you must be back to normal. So glad I have people in my life who do really understand and don't need to be reminded or helped to understand how my life has changed - I am really trying to focus on moving forward from this but it really is so hard to do - to let go of the worry and just be awake to today with no thoughts to health, reoccurrance rates, treatment etc. and so it is comforting to know you guys are here and understand. We are getting through this - thanks to all of you for checking in and responding, for just being here - I am very grateful. Sonia ",

Glad to hear your doc said things look good. I had my f/u with surgeon today - said \"MRI's are 99% accurate - some say 100%\". I asked if I could skip the mammo and ultrasound in February - she said no - so the end of Feb more docs, tests and f/u. It seems it will never end. I'm with you Karen - I told my surgeon I wished I would have had a double mastectomy and she said that I was crazy - there was no reason and I should be relieved given my MRI. I responded with it could come back and of course she couldn't argue with me.  No middle ground for me either. I'm glad to hear your memory is flawed Donna - makes me feel better about forgetting nearly everything. Tracye - I have not asked for a PET - don't think they would give me one and I'm not sure I would want one - too terrified about what they would find. I think I don't want to know if it's in me. I'm with you though on feeling accomplished after cleaning - I love the feeling of getting rid of things, cleaning things out etc. It's almost like if I'm not using it, I think what am I saving it for and this seems to be the impetus for getting rid of tons of stuff.    Hope all you wonderful women are taking good care of yourselves. ",

They said as a result my margin was not good because of its proximity to the chest wall and lack of tissue in that area. I, like you am try not to let it freak me out.  Never had an oncotype - whenever I hear all you USA people compare your scores I do feel like that was a missing piece which then makes me feel like I should have got chemo - oh will this worry ever go away. Definitely feel like I am a radically changed person after spending the weekend with an old friend I haven't see since cancer. I could feel the change in me so strongly - I was surprised. I can only imagine how different I must have seemed to her. The changes have become clearer and clearer to me - I feel like I am just really starting to see and feel the new me. I think the intensity of my connections to others has really diminished. Sometimes I feel pretty alone - even when surrounded by others. Weird.   ",

I am waiting for a follow up ultrasound on the breast MRI I had in June. I have been diagnosed with ILC and have had surgery and am going to start the preparation for radiation on Monday and feel like there is still this thing hanging over my head so I can totally relate. I want you to know that you, like so many women who post here will probably have a b9 result - but the waiting is so difficult, the idea of cancer so terrifying. I can't believe I am writing this but, I actually am pretty much back to feeling like myself again. I really have come through this dark place of being so scared, facing my worst fears to now really recognizing that I can recover from this and the most important attitude I can have is one of courage and strength and trying to be as positive as possible. Even though it sucks, it really does get more manageable. I wouldn't wish this on anyone and I know there are so many women on here that have things so much worse than I do/did. but I realize that if I can get through this, I can get through anything. Keep thinking b9 thoughts, visualize a healthy outcome, try to distract yourself, HANG IN THERE!!! I am keeping you in my thoughts. Sonia ",

I had a followup ultrasound because I had an area of concern that had to be checked after my breast MRI and it has come back clear - so yay that!!! I start radiation on Tuesday and I am anxious to get started but anxious about getting started - the idea of radiation scares me but I had a very oddly placed tumor far up on my chest wall and as a result the anterior margin was not clear so radiation is a must in my case. The doctors have changed the radiation plan for me as of yesterday because they were going to radiate my whole breast which didn't make sense because my tumor site is no where near my breast - so now they aren't going to radiate my breast but will focus the radiation on the tumor site. So I am feeling better about that as that means not as much of my lung will get radiated. I happlily don't work in the summer so I will be able to rest throughout this next phase of treatment and get it out of the way before I go back to work in September. So, I am trying to count my blessings. YOU, are going to be ok. Hang in there. Sonia",

It burned while the liquid was going in but it was over quick and I was allowed to leave right away. So my experience was quite different from Isla's. I had my sentinel node biopsy on a Wednesday and was back at work the following Tuesday. I could have went Monday but I wasn't allowed to shower until Tuesday so I didn't want to go to work feeling nasty. I had 4 nodes removed. I work as a counsellor so I was able to just sit and relax. I started the recommended exercises the second day and I have had no issues and have had a full recovery with only one minor post operative issue - a stitch abscess that emerged during radiation but cleared within a couple of days. It was just a stitch that didn't dissolve properly. I know this is a really scary and overwhelming time, but it really is going to be ok - you'll get through. Hang in there. Sonia ",
