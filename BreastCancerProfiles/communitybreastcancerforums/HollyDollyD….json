She had surgery, chemo, radiation and aromatase inhibitors in that order. And a wonderful oncologist. Who has just become my oncologist. She fought this with everything she had - and is still going strong at 70+ and working full time. Cheering you on, sister, Holly",

There's a guide here on how to read your pathology report that might help: www.breastcancer.org/cms.../Breastcancerorg_Pathol... However, if you don't understand anything, you can also ask your Dr. to explain it again in laymans terms, or call the American Cancer Society or Komen and have someone walk you through it. If you are triple positive, it means that your cancer is responsive to estrogen and progesterone (hormones), and that you are HER2/Neu positive. It's great if it is responsive to hormones, as that opens up treatment options. You are probably being given herceptin because HER2+ tumors are receptive to that. Keep coming back and asking questions here - there's a wealth of experience and support and just plain old love here. Hugs, Holly",

I love it, because it also monitors my pulse and my sleep - so I can track those. I'm just a nerdy data geek - ha. I started out with a Fitbit HR (no longer made) then got a Charge before my Ionic. I love that I can track my meds, etc. through reminders to my watch that just quietly buzz on my wrist. Not obtrusive at all. 10,000 steps per day is meant to be a good starting point. However, I got mine when I was doing 40 per day due to arthritis - and I increased it 50 steps/day from there. Holly",
