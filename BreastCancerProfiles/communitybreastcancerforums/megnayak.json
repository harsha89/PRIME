She received her mammogram report on her birthday last Friday, and it indicated a BIRAD score of 5. She is scheduled for her biopsy tomorrow, and we are all praying for her. She just turned 36 and feels like her world is coming to an end. For me, this is all so new, but reading about it so I can be strong for her, makes me realise how incredible all you women are in your strength, and how many options and choices there are in the medical world. I'm praying that she receives good news too. Thanks so much for sharing your stories!",
