And I have never had anything like that before! Today just back to achy bones and tiredness. I didn\u2019t ask the doc about the acupuncturist, I will do so. But the needles are always new so I am not sure what they would object to. I am supposed to travel to France 5 days after my 2nd chemo. My doc said it would be \u2018no problem! -especilly with neulastA. It is a nonstop flight and a riverboat Cruise on the Seine for 9daya. Not too taxing. But now I am beginning to think this is nuts! I do have trip insurance and an international medical policy. If I do have a complication, then I am probably in trouble. Still not decided....",

But I am still achy and in bed. I did have a fever spiked to 100.9Â°. But no obvious infection source. The weirdest symptom I\u2019ve had is excruciating back spasms in the lower back and pelvis area. Those came up and lasted for about 24 hours and we\u2019re quite intense. ( I got in my car and shut the windows and screamed at the highest decibel possible the entire way to the acupuncturist. She was able to get the spasms to come down a little. But the Valium and Flexeril combo that I took when I got home really finally calm that down. . I wish I felt a little better! I thought maybe the only symptoms would show up The first three days. I was hoping to work this week. My best time is in the early morning. I do get up and feed and walk my dogs about 2 miles. Then that seems to be it for the day, back to bed",

I was surprised how difficult the recovery was -I guess I didn\u2019t have the right expectations. The expander bags have been uncomfortable and I can\u2019t get them out until after the chemo and the radiation -which is October. This cancer was caught right before I was expat to Europe for my job-which is now on hold. I did a local Denver surgeon and plastic surgeon but a second opinion at MD ANDERSON in Houston. The only diffference is the MD oncologist still uses Adriamycin for chemo where my local oncologist sites the ABC study and another German one showing 1-2% difference in 4-5 year reoccurrence. So we will try chemo without it. I have a great physical therapist who specializes in oncology follow up for mastectomy. I am also doing accupuncture.",
