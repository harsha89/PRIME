I found that yesterday was like a breakdown day for me. I just took a moment and hadn\u2019t a good cry. I was achy and seems either gas or heartburn or something was just sitting in the middle of my chest. The surgeon placed port on the right side. It\u2019s feeling much better, yesterday the incision was super itchy. I was a bit concerned about getting the port at first , that fear of the unknown however I am glad I did , it made the infusion Friday less horrifying for me. I also did the Neulasta and while there has been slight pain it\u2019s been bearable and taking the Claritin definitely help. ",

My nurse didn't do such a great job accessing port which led to a second stick and I'm not sure what happened when she placed the Neulasta on abdomen. Seems like my heart rate has been at 120-124. Stomach cramps even though I'm drinking lots of fluids. I did notice that I didn't ache as bad with the Neulasta this time so I hope it injected properly. I was able to function at work each day and get my son to his 2 soccer practices. Even followed the doctor's orders to do 10 mins on treadmill. I think that maybe because the infusion started out rocky it zapped me of my bubble happy place and once I lost that focus it was really hard to get it back. I did notice that today my heart rate was getting closer to 100. I just think I let the stress take over and overhelm me. Hopefully week 2 will show improvement. I did have a friend that just made sure she stayed in close contact even though she's in another state. I think I would have just curled in a ball and cried has she not kept that continuous contact. Stay strong everyone....we got this!!",

My appetite is pretty much nonexistent, eat because I have to. I have noticed pains coming and sometimes intense before fading to nothing and I assume is from the Neulasta. I am just trying to take one day at a time. I find that even if I just browse through here, I am connecting with others and I find some comfort just hate the circumstances. But I am learning \u201cwe got this\u201d! Stay strong my fellow warriors!!!",
