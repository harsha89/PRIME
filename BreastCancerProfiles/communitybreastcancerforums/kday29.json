They did not give me any sort of report or rating after the ultrasound nor did they recommend a biopsy.  I am a student and am completing my placement over the next few days so I am hoping that will help to take my mind off of things but my anxiety makes it difficult to push worry out of my mind.",

      "Content": "kday29 wrote: Hello, I am 26 years old. During a breast exam a couple of weeks ago my doctor felt a lump in my left breast. I have not been able to feel the lump myself and she felt the lump at first and then could not find it again. I also have a lump on my right breast that has been there for about a year (if not more). I noticed it last year and I went for an ultrasound and they did not find anything on the ultrasound; however, it is a year later and the lump is still there. I do not think it has grown or changed at all. I am experiencing no other symptoms with my breasts, everything else seems normal. I have been waiting to get my ultrasound results on both breasts and I am honestly going out of my mind with worry. I feel paralyzed to move forward with my life until I get some results. Every day feels like an eternity. I do not have family history of breast cancer, but I am not the most healthy person - I don't really exercise and I am overweight. I do not have any family history of breast cancer but I have been on the Birth Control Pill for about 9 years. I also, being a stupid teenager, used to carry my cell phone in my bra in the same place that the lump is on my right breast. It is torture waiting for the clinic to call me with some answers. I also cannot get in to see my doctor until May 3rd; although the clinic did say that a nurse can give me my results over the phone. The technicians at the ultrasound literally told me nothing. They confirmed with a radiologist that they got sufficient images and that was it. I don't know how to just sit here and keep waiting. It is torture. Log in to post a reply",
