I also just completed 6 weeks of radiation and have started on Tamox for the next 5 years.  It is worth the loss of hair, feeling yucky, to know I did everything available to me to be safe.  I am now training for that marathon that got taken away from me last year and I feel incredible!  My last chemo was 11/2/11 and though I have a few slight side effects from it, I am strong and on my way to living again!  You should do what feels best to you in your heart.  Numbers are important but it is what those numbers mean to you that should help you make your decisions.  Chemo is bad, and maybe I was lucky, but it wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, and I would do it all over again the exact same way.  I wish you peace in your decision making and a journey back to health that is speedy and smooth.",
