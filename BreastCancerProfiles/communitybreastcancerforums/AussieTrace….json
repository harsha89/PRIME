After about 6 weeks my cardiologist felt it was very slow growing and he would review me in 8 weeks time. The next day I went to the zoo with my family and walked around all day and was fine. Over the next couple of days I had increasing shortness of breath and a cough that became intractable. I then developed a fever. I actually had my mum\u2019s 80 Th Birthday party to organise and a lunch to go too. After my mum\u2019s party I was very tired but I had been really busy. I jokingly said to my husband that I thought I would be in hospital by the time he came home from work! And I was my daughter who usually ignores anything to do with my cancer became very worried about me and insisted I go to hospital. I had actually gone into cardiac tamponade and was in heart failure. I had an emergency pericardial window cut to drain the fluid compressing my heart. At the same time they did a pleuradesis on my left lung. At the time they told me I had 3 months to live. However I have had a fantastic response to Xeloda and I am feeling great. If you feel short of breath or you are coughing relentlessly don\u2019t ignore it like I did I almost left things too late. Wishing you all the best",

They were hoping it would shrink with femara and then be able to be removed but this never happened. As I said rads worked wonders",

I did go on to develop bone mets but all symptoms from the brachial plexus mets resolved following rads. I was initially concerned that rads would worsen my lymphoedema but this was not the case. In fact lymphoedema improved significantly over time so I suspect the met to the brachial plexus had been the cause of the lymphoedema. Â As yet I have not had chemo but is probably on the horizon as I have now been through all the hormonal treatments. A biopsy will give you information about the receptors status of your cancer that will help determine your treatment.",

In the last year I have developed lung and pericardial mets and this time last year I was very close to death due to cardiac tamponade. I had surgery and changed treatment to Xeloda and to the surprise of my oncologist I am still here and functioning really well. My oncologist talks about pace of disease and response to treatment. Xeloda worked for a year for me I have recently had a new lung met and changed to Abraxane and again my tumour markers are decreasing again. You also sound like the pace of year disease is reasonably slow and you have had a great response to treatment. My cancer was originally hormone positive and her2 negative and has now changed to triple negative so I can relate to your fear of brain mets but there are also positive stories on the brain mets forum that help keep that fear in check for me. Nancy you are also still on your second line of standard of care treatment so you have many options to explore but also if you did have progression you would be a good candidate for a trial. Wishing you all the best Tracey",
