The reconstruction that i will be having is taking out my tissue expander (t/e) then putting the nice soft implant in( because the t/e is so uncomfortable like a brick on your chest) i am also having surgery on my other breast that did not have cancer to have it match the new implant breast . But all this will take along time in the mean time i have the t/e breast up and painful and the other sagging about 2 inches lower . i cannot wear a bra cause the t/e is so painful especially with rads tightening it up even more... if i could where a bra i could lift the droopy one but no way ouch!!!! so i stay in the house probably will till im reconstructed about a year i guess. i use to be very social,and worked out regulary,i even was a jazzercise instructed up till about 1 year ago.. But life is on hold now unless anyone know how to lift just one breast temporarily ha ha i hope all goes quick and painless for you god bless",
