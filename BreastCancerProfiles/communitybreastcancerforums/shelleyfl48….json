I'm so glad I went to Mayo Clinic and had a consult.  My best bet may be to find a local oncologist who can work with me.  I am very concerned about the false positive readings.  I have read that 1 in 10 MRIs give false positives; however, they improve once you have a baseline MRI to compare future readings to.  It is a tough call.  How did your doctor evaluate your risk?  Does a younger age at treatment result in higher risk.  I was 23 and I have no other risk factors for BC.  Just curious how they can come up with a number.  I am going to be more vigilant on the self exams.  It seems that a lot of people have found it that way.   ",

I have always gotten mammograms and hoped for the best, but this year I have begun to take it more seriously. I had read somewhere that risk declines once you are 30 years out, but when I looked for that article again, I couldn't find it. I was curious how the risk factors were presented to you. I had the same mantle radiation dose that you had. Thank you so much for responding. I don't want to live in fear, but I find this decision very difficult. It is not helped by the fact that my current gynecologist seems to think MRIs are not a good choice because of the false positives. It may be time to find a new doctor, although I've been happy with him for everything else. Blessings, Shelley",
