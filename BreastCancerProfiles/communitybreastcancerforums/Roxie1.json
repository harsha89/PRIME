So next Tuesday they go back in and remove a wider margin and some nodes. I was told I could go through a month of radiation, 5 days a week or opt for the mastectomy and bypass the radiation. I guess I'm a category 1 until they find out if there's any lymph node involvement.  I thought I was home free thinking that it was just an abcess/infection, the pain was gone immediately after the lump was removed, wasn't even sore after the lumpectomy.

Yes I would like the link to the relaxation hypnosis video when you have time. Still no word on the biopsy date. Dr office did not have the radiology report yet, went to the hospital and got a copy and hand delivered it to the office.  Now have to wait until I hear back. Am going to do another post here in the hopes that someone can translate the report, tried googling but could not find the combination of wording.  Thanks bunches",

I never got a chance to speak with the radiologist, he was busy and had the nurse ( the one that did the mammo and sonogram ) tell me that they were going to have my dr refer me to a b/s to have a biopsy done. Date has not been set yet, but was told that there was fluid in there and that he didn't know if it was blood or pus (nasty). I am relieved now that they want me to have a biopsy done instead of a 6 month wait, I have been hurting pretty bad, constant burning and stinging in that area for almost a month now, could not handle waiting 6 months. Originally went to the dr thinking I had an abcess due to an injury a couple of months ago. (no longer afraid of the biopsy process since another kind poster informed me that they had the same type of biopsy). What you said about hypoechoic on u/s showing up as a dark area, I remember trying to look at the monitor as she was doing the sonogram and I saw the darker,black area on the lighter background. I am hoping that it is one of those fibroadenomes that you mentioned above. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply, it is very much appreciated.",

I tried googling but couldn't find the \"full combination\"of \"complex lobulated heterogeneously hypoechoic mass\". Standard mammographic views were obtained and demonstrate a 1.2 centimeter mass in the 12 o'clock position. Spot compression views confirm the presence of a discrete mass with lobulated borders.  Sonographic evaluation of the area of palpable and mammographic abnormality demonstrated a 1 centimeter \"complex lobulated heterogeneously hypoechoic mass.  Also states that the finding is suspicious and gives it a Birad Category 4.

A couple months ago I got a nasty puncture wound when unloading 60lb bales of wired alfalfa hay and lost my balance and fell into a bale and the wire punctured my breast.Ended up with a huge bruise there around the puncture location. Had had a tetanus shot a few years back so didn't seek medical attention and it didn't fester so I thought all was good. The lump is in the same general area.Husband also reminded me of something I had forgotten last night on the phone, shortly after the puncture our big dog ran and jumped me as I was in the process of bending down to pick something up and she catapulted off me and hit me full force in the same breast with her nails. Hubby works out of state and is being as supportive as possible on a long distance basis so dealing with this stuff basically alone. I just about GOOGLED myself STUPID with the symptoms so, SO GLAD I found this forum and the wonderful people here.Sincerely thanking you for your support.",
