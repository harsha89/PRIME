During both surgeries the surgeon injected fluid into the space where the tissue was removed. He said I would hear sloshing from the fluid which I found to be very true. I don't understand why fluid was purposely injected into the space. I can find nothing about this, but instead can only find information about fluid developing after lumpectomy (seroma) that may need to be drained. Has anyone else heard of this practice?",
