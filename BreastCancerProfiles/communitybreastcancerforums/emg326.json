I stayed in the hospital for 4 days for pain management/recovery from anesthesia and was dying to wash my hair when I got home. My 10 year old daughter and a friend of mine washed it for me in the sink. I couldn't shower until the drains came out after a week. I took baths and continued to use the sink for my hair, but I really didn't worry about styling it. I felt pretty good after 10 days or so and was able to drive after 2 weeks.  Sleeping is a challenge, and you'll want lots of pillows to prop yourself up, or some people sleep in recliners. Also, make sure to keep the lids loose on your prescriptions, or you won't be able to get them off.  I'm glad I made the choice to do both at the same time. Good luck!",

I did it mainly because my tumor was grade 3.  The surgery and chemo have been completely doable. Both things have come such a long way in the last 10 years. My last chemo will be the end of Oct. Then I'll finish reconstruction. Have I had days of fear, dread, self-pity etc...?  Of course, but I honestly have tried to not let this control my life. I want to control it, and I've done everything I can to make that happen. One of my friends told me yesterday that she forgets I'm going through this because of the way I'm dealing with it and how my attitude is. I told her I don't want bc to define me; it's something that happened, and I have to deal with it.

I've been told anything over 1 cm. should have chemo and if you can reduce chance of recurrence by more than 4% it should be done. My oncotype was 16 (recurrence risk of 10%) which is considered low/intermediate and in the \"gray area\" where they don't really know the benefit of chemo. My onc. wouldn't steer me either way, but she wasn't surprised when I chose to do it. Adjuvant online said I would get over a 4% benefit. My tumor was 1.9 cm and grade 3. I got a second opinion, and he said for those reasons I should do chemo. That's exactly how I felt. So I go for tx #3 Monday of Taxotere and Cytoxan, and it hasn't been nearly as bad as I thought it'd be. Definitely doable as they say. I'll have my last one at the end of Oct.
