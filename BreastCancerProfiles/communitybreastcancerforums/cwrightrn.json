My kids are 15, 14, 12....the youngest is my only girl.  She and I have had discussions about how our lives are parallel in many ways: both of us had to grow up quick--in her case because mom is sick, in my case it was because my mom worked and I lived in an abusive home.  But I cooked, cleaned, watched after an infant sister--at age 12--and that was after having hip surgery at age 11 and being in a wheelchair for 6 months.  My mom was just never there and we didn't have the relationship that my daughter and I do.  Just recently I had a talk with my daughter about the fact that although my mom and I weren't close, that other women stepped into that role at different times in my life...my Aunts, older ladies at church, etc....and I assured her that it would be the same for her---that God would give her other women to lean on when needed.  I have talked to some women family members about it (names who I mentioned to my daughter) and they all assured me they would be there for her. Anyway, that's my two cents.... ",

Hope that helps....that was my experience ",

VATS procedure- where a cardiothoracic surgeon does a thorascopy, removes the fluid, puts in talc and a chest tube and you sit in the hospital waiting for the hole to seal.  This is very invasive and she said that with my history of fluid build up, I could be in the hospital quite awhile. Then she talked to me about switching chemo....bye bye xeloda and Ixempra and hello to gemzar and carboplat.  I asked her if it was possible the pleural effusion could be helped by new chemo and she said yes so I asked about just doing another thoracentesis which is the least invasive and hope the chemo works.  So I'm going to do a chest xray Monday and see how bad its gotten in 2 weeks and then do a thoracentesis later this week. I also finally consented to oxygen at home.  We took some camping (we have a 30 foot trailer so its luxury camping) and I used it at night.  My hubby thinks it helps my work of breathing but I find it drying and makes me cough more....who knows. Linda, I so understand the feeling of getting worse...and I HATE the breathing problems!  You can cry on my shoulder any time....I'm right there with you Blessings and hugs Carole ",

But they did brushings that were all negative for infection.  So infection is ruled out.  Because I have had recent skin mets recurrence, the oncologist is suspicious it is lymphangitic spread to the lungs. There were NO nodules or anything glaring at the pulmonologist during the bronch which is good news (one site I googled about this type of spread said that nodules are usually present).  I am convinced that the avastin caused the cough (it got worse with each avastin dose) and that time will clear it up....at least I'm praying for that.  Just wondering if anyone else has this or has heard of it.  The oncologist isn't in a rush to do a biopsy cause I am going back on chemo--and I don't want to do another bronch any time soon.  I am now taking hydrocodone either as pill or in cough syrup to help me sleep at night-- nothing else works--not inhalers, steroids (I'm on 40mg of prednisone), antihistamines, etc... Believe me, I've tried everything. Anyone with any experience out there?  After being on avastin/abraxane I will switch either to a Parp/gemzar/carboplat (if I can get it for compassionate use) or Ixempra/xeloda--I'm worried about the Ixempra/xeloda combo as I've heard it works well but when it comes back it is super charged.  Thanks for your thoughts.

Make sure you let the Dr know about what is going on... perhaps some benadryl would help since she is so swollen.   Please call and let the Dr know what is going on and see what the Dr would recommend Hang in there blessings and hugs Carole ",

I read your past posts and noted that you did ACT at diagnosis and now cytoxin and taxol, right?  Why is xeloda next instead of avastin/abraxane or other IV chemo's...gemzar/carboplat, ixempra, etc...?  Just curious....  I've read a lot about xeloda and it working for many people.  I will have a scan in a few weeks to see if the avastin/abraxane is working for me....and being TN chemo will be lifelong so we will do some variation of it if its working or move to the next cocktail. Hang in there.... Blessings and hugs Carole ",

Thanks again for this post and for helping me to see the giving up of the job in a different light. ",

I had been doing charge nursing and working on the rapid response team and had 2 sentinel events in December (prior to diagnosis) caused by the same CRNA that I had to go to tons of meetings for....nothing like a little stress, right?  And YES, night shift was my risk factor for breast cancer- ugh!!  (I had an aunt who had bc but a different type and my BRCA was negative). My manager has been very supportive and I took short term disability at diagnosis...being superwoman I thought I could work but when everyone was crying, including some of the Dr's I knew I couldn't do it.  In fact, now that I'm done with mastectomy and facing more chemo with rads the Dr said I could go back BUT I work in a cesspool of germs and have opted to shift to long term disability (I don't need ssdi yet).  My hospital will hold a job in house til July of next year so I have time....and my manager has assured me a job on my floor (thankfully).  I haven't read all the pages of this forum but was wondering if any of you went back to full time nocs?  I'm hoping to go back after the first of the year.  My unit will allow me to work 4 hour shifts to start and work my way back....just not sure what to do.  I have inflammatory breast cancer and the risk of recurrence in the first few years is very high and working full time would help my family in case I need to go on SSDI.  I have a friend on my unit that battled bc and is 5 years out and she is glad she came back to our floor, despite the stress because of the great patient care.  She thought I would be frustrated if I went to a less stressful but higher acuity area say like tele.  So that's my scoop....thanks for listening and for your thoughts...
