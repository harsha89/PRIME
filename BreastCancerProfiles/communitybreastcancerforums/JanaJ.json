I am two hrs from the dr and do not want to go back unless absolutely necessary.  Also, I am still using pain medication regularly.  I am very sore and hard to take a deep breath and to move around.  Is any else still on pain meds 2 weeks post bi mx?  When I asked for a refill on monday I sensed hesitation from the nurse.  I still feel I need them so that I can move around.",

Glad to know you did not get const.  That makes you feel so bad.  And yea, seems like this won't go away.  My MD said breast cancer is like diabetes, \"You don't cure it, you have to manage it\"  Some people never see it again but some do.",

My PS wanted me to do reconstruction after I healed from the Bi MX because I had a lumpectomy in 09 (had IDC stage 1, grade 3, tumor .08 cm, rt breast). At that time I had 4 rounds of chemo and radiation X 6 wks.  Since my right breast was radiated, she said my have trble healing.  At this point looks good though.  When dr took drains out Monday he also gave me ABX (Keflex) for infection, sites were red & painful.  After taking this for 3 days pain is much better.  My pain is better now so may not ask for more pain meds.  My bleeding has stoped for now also.  So I feel like I am making progress now.  Hope to start reconstruction 7 weeks post MX. tigerw0man - no, not taking muscle relaxants, never offered to me.  Maybe b/c I don't have the TE.  But pain is better today, so more hopeful I won't need pain meds. profbee - Hope a/c goes well next week.  maggiestatas - I know what you mean about the poop thing.  It was several days after surgery before I could go and boy was it painful.  But I have been eating those sunsweet prunes & that helps and drinking plenty of fluids.  I have heard so many women say the worst thing about their masectomy was the constipation afterwards. treegirl - sounds like you may be having another infection or the ABX is not getting rid of the infection.  I would tell the MD.",

Well, it was eventually.  Anyway, I am considering having the diep flap reconst.  Have not made final arrangements with my PS but we discussed it at length.  Seems like there are a lot of women on here that are going with TE's and I am assuming that means implants rather than diep flap reconst.  I go to see my PS on 10-20-11 to schedule reconst if all is well.  From what I understand with diep flap reconst they use your body tissue & skin to make the breasts.  I hope this requires no TE's but I'll do what I have to to have boobs again.  Oh, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY to your daughter! Hope yall have a good day.  I have 3 daughters (15, 21, 23) and 1 son(9).",
