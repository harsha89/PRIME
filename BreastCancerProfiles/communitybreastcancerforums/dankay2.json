      "Content": "dankay2 wrote: Hello All, I am so glad I found this forum.  I am 43 years old and waiting for the results of my stereotactic core needle biopsy that was done last Wednesday, April 25.    My mother was DX with BC when she was 48 and has been free of cancer for the last 18 years.  We do not carry the BRCA gene. This is my second biopsy.  The first one was 5 1/2 years ago and turned out to be benign.  I do not remember the waiting being this long and hard. It seems to me last time I had the results in one day, although both the mammo and the biopsy were done at a different facility than the place I went to this time.  Anyway,  I got so much conflicting information so far, I do not know how to feel.  I went in for my screening mammo and was told to come back a week later for my diagnostic because there was an area on the right side that they needed more images of.  After the diagnostic mammo I was given an ultrasound by two young student doctors (this is at a large university training hospital) and was told a I had a 1cm mass at 12 o'clock and needed to come in for a biopsy.  When I spoke with my PCP she told me they had contacted her and told her the mass was 1.9 cm (double the size) so this of course sent me into even more panic.  When I went to the biopsy the radiologist could not locate the mass on the ultrasound so she brought in her colleague and the films and it turns out the mass was not located at 12 o'clock but at 6 o'clock.  I have no idea what they were looking at at 12 o'clock on the ultrasound but apparently it was not the mass that they were worried about.    Anyway, the radiologist told me it did not look benign which is why they were doing the biopsy.  Anyway, the procedure was pretty easy and not painful.  They told me they took several very good samples.  After the procedure the radiologist came back in and told me \"now that I see the samples, I think your mass might very well be benign.\"  Now what is that supposed to mean?  What can they tell by simply looking at the samples??? So now I am waiting on the path report and diagnosis and going crazy.  I keep swinging back and forth between thinking I will be fine to imagining something awful.  The longer it takes the more I think it might not be benign.  I do not know how to feel. I am scared and confused about all the conflicting information.  This is at a top medical center in a major US city too!   Log in to post a reply",
