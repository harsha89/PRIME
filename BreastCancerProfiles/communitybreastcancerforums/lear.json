Did you have lumpectomy or mastectomy? I was radiated 12 years ago for cancer in left breast - lumpectomy followed by six weeks radiation. In 2010 I was diagnosed with cancer in right breast - options the same - chose the same lumpectomy followed by radiation. Worried about receiving more radiation and the length of time after first surgery. Supposed to start next week and this will be 18 weeks from 1st surgery in Sept 2010. Any thoughts on this. A friend of mine had mastectomy and did not need radiation. Another friend had a mastectomy and was told she needed radiation? Also wondering if I should just get a mastectomy then I don't have to worry about the radiation, I think? ",

My breast surgery was September 22 but I did not receive the pathology result until October 18th. Pathology confirmed large area of dcis and invasive lobular cancer. I was then sent to an oncologist and a radiologist in November and both recommended lymph node surgery. Back to the surgeon December 3 had surgery and was node negative. Booked for radiation January 2011. I asked about the long delay from initial surgery and to start date of radiation have not received an answer to my question - is there an optimal time when one should be radiated after surgery? Further, would radiation treatment be pointless 3 months after surgery?",
