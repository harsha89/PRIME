Well, now I am 22 and finally I'm getting some answers about it, after months of being told to wait and different tests/screenings. It's understandable that you're feling afraid. I was frightened out of my mind as well. I had a mammo and 2 ultrasounds done as well. I was referred to get a fine needle aspiration done on the lump (something that really scared me because I was hoping the doctors would tell me to just go home and that it was clearly a benign mass) but it was suspected to be a fibroadenoma because it was rather mobile. In my case, the biopsy (the results of which I received just today) revealed it to be a benign mass. When I had my FNA biopsy done, the lady sprayed this cold liquid in my breast just to numb the outside and then stuck a very thin needle into the lump, jiggling it around a bit to extract the cells. She did it about 4 times to get enough samples. I won't lie... it felt very unpleasant, more so because my breasts are very dense due to my age. It's a bit scary, but once you realize that you will be getting the truth back, there's a sense of relief that [hopefully] it'll all be over soon. (I'll also most likely be getting the mass surgically removed sometime next year due to discrepencies between my mammogram, ultrasounds, and biopsy. Let's stay strong!)",

Maybe they're very busy, I don't know. I doubt they would read me my results over the phone, although that would be convenient as once I go in next Wednesday to get my results, I'll have to play the waiting game to even see the doctor (what I get for having no money and no health insurance, I guess). That will play with my nerves severely, I know. Lately, I can't stop touching and feeling my breasts. My right breast feels all lumpy and weird now and the outer side of my breast feels thicker/harder especially the very edges of my breast tissue. I'm scared there are several big lumps in there that were being missed due to my breast tissue having more density (22 years old with small breasts). If I grab the sides of my breasts and squeeze inside, it definitely feels tougher on the side facing my hip. The outer side of my left breast (original mass breast) felt like that as well but now the right feels the same? I am due for my period any day now, but I don't know if my period has ever made the outside of my right breast feel harder like this.",

It's just so tough getting my breast MRI results because everytime I call, it's always a machine telling me they are away from the phone and to leave my number. I was told I could get my results tomorrow if it was ready and read by the doctor by tomorrow but no one has called me about it so I'm guessing I have to wait until next Wednesday...? Why is there so much waiting? The waiting is going to make me very sick. Every new day is a new symptom. I spent about half an hour today looking up invasive lobular carcinoma and its symptoms and pitying myself over it. Everytime I read a symptom it's like \"Omg, breast thickening? I believe I have that. 'FNAs not very reliable with ILC'? So my FNA meant nothing?! Etc.\" I keep doubting what I knew/thought I knew about my breasts every week. The chest pressure is just the very worst part. It sits there reminding me that while I may not have breast cancer or cancer of anything in general, something--no matter how treatable or unthreatening it is--is wrong with me, it can't only be emotional, and it's been there for well over half a year. It just adds fuel to the fire that the area in question is my chest (or upper stomach?), so close to my breasts that are causing me so much grief right now.",

I finally had a breast MRI yesterday but have yet to even be able to make an appointment to see the breast specialist about it) but I've also had chest pressure that's been constant in my chest for 8 months or so. It only seems to go away when I'm feeling especially confident and feels much worse when my mind is in a dark place. I thought it was could be due to the stress my body has been under for the past 1 1/2 years, and when I brought up \"chest pressure\" to the doctor I saw, he said it was probably just anxiety and not related to bc. He didn't do any specific chest testing though so now I feel a bit worried about that. I compeletly regret not pushing them to check my chest wall sooner, but I was also thinking it was anxiety since it lets up when I feel really good about myself/situation. I also have 2 protruberences on my ribs that lead to my nipple, and they are probably just ribs, but every bump is scary right now. None of the doctors who have checked me out say anything about it, but could they be tumors on my chest wall or enlarged, cancer-filled lymph nodes? In bc that's metastisized to the chest wall, would the pressure be constant or would it let up under certain circumstances? Would it normally be in one specific spot of the chest or just a general feeling of tightness? Having gone through this feeling for almost 8 months, I really want to stay positive that this isn't anything of concern and not related to the lumps I have. Log in to post a reply",

It did go away for the happiest few weeks or so of my life (when I first started dating my wonderful bf and found out that the FNA result was benign) and I even remember saying to my bf \"Hey, I haven't had any chest pressure in a while!\" and when I remembered that the date was approaching for me to see the doctor at the tumor clinic, it aaaall came back again. The pain in my breasts, the never-letting-up pressure inside of me. Guided meditation would probably do wonders for my mental state. If you know any helpful sites you could share with me, that would be wonderful. :)Â ",

I find it hard to just really let myself go and relax as my mind's always in a frenzy, especially these past few weeks. It seems to be that only when my mind is completely clear of negative thoughts and fears regarding my health (not often at all lately) does the pressure go away. Otherwise it just sits there haunting me. I finally managed to get an appointment with the doctor March 26th (hopefully I can convince them to take me in earlier) to get the results of my MRI so I'll have to get through the next 2 weeks and hopefully not freak out again.",

It's like another week to torment myself over this before I can get any sort of answer or let my concerns be known. All the possibilities of what'll happen on Wednesday are flying through my mind, alternating between being positive exchanges and good news and being bad news. I woke up last night with this aching, stiff pain in my lower left rib cage area (where the sternum ends and at the pointed part right before the rib begins to curve around the bottom) and of course I ended up freaking out about it, thinking the very worst! The pain is still there (mostly when I stretch my back or press on the area in some way) but I think it might be from the way I've been constantly pushing on that area for days, trying to feel my stomach for any masses or anything weird (I'm serious). I feel like a hypochondriac lunatic these days, honestly. Each ache or pain makes me jump 10 feet into the air screaming that it's a symptom and I'm gonna die from it.I know that if the stiff feeling in my rib doesn't go away by tomorrow, I'm gonna be panicking again I've been feeling irrational for a few weeks straight and I'll be sooo glad when this is all over. Thank God I have a place I can come to and just vent and whine and still be understood. You girls are great and help make this stress bearable.<3",

I don't think I've ever been a calm person, always being a worrywart and running around like a chicken with its head cut off at the smallest thing. My little sis has always called me a \"spaz.\" I was wondering if anyone has or knows anything about hiatal hernias? The pressure I have in my chest sometimes seems to be coming from up in my stomach, especially after a good-sized meal on a stressful day. The pressure also fluctuates. It really wasn't even until a week or so ago (when my right breast started to feel funny and I found a new lump in my right breast + palpable lymph nodes under both armpits) that the pressure started to really bother me and come in much more tightening ways. I can barely even eat anymore these past few days and I can't pinpoint if that's stress or something more serious. I hate to try and self-diagnose the chest pressure as it's potentially a very serious symptom that I've been carrying around for so many months, but the only other alternative is to sit here and assume the worst about what it could be.",
