All I can say is that try to stay positive for yourself and for ur kids too. See we have to cross this journey, so it's better to be +ve rather than bein -ve. I know it's easy to say but believe me it's not that too hard also, just look at ur kids and then think. And yes if u want to cry, then cry as much as u want as that also helps. Good luck",
