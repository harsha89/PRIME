Especially being that I am grade 3 in the prelim biopsy path report, I do not think there will be a big difference in the oncotype results but I am praying there will be and I will not need either one chemo or radiation. At This point I am just anxiously awaiting to see the BS on Wednesday, having surgery and moving forward in this battle. It is the not knowing what's nextÂ  that is killing me.Â Â Also knowing everyday I have cancer inside my body and potentially growing and Â spreading is driving me nuts.Â For some strange reason now I will not even lay down on the left side because I think it will aggravate the left breast and the cancer cell will spread to other areas.Â Am IÂ being silly for thinking that?Â Â ",

      "Content": "CA-Sunshine wrote: Hello everyone, I am trying to come to terms with this Â BC dx. I am aÂ married 45 yo with a 3yo daughter and is in fightÂ mode. When I was 10 yrs old my mother was dx with BC and passed away 2 yrs later when I was 12. On 6/12/17, I was given the news that my biopsy results were positive for BC so here I am 33 yrs later preparing to personally attempt to slay the ugly BC monster. Here is what I know so far left breast with 2 sites: Site A. ER/PR +Â  HER2 - 1 cm, ki -67 is 30%(poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, high grade ductal carcinoma in-situ with focal necrosis and calcification) Site B ER/PR + HER2 - ki -67 35% 1.1 cm(poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma)Â  From US report there is no lymph node involvement so I am stage 1 is what the nurse navigator stated. . Genetics test shows Â BRCA 2 detected heterozygous uncertain variant.Â  I am in California is having all of my records sent to City of Hope National Cancer Hospital for a second opinion and treatment. No I have not had a breast MRI order yet but think when I go to COH next week they will order that next. I am scheduled to see BS on 6/28 to discuss my options. I have spent the last week researching information now I am ready to have a BMX, I do not really want to have chemo but if I have to I will do it then Â startÂ Â radiation and get back to some type of normalcy. I thought I had truly beat the odds when I turned 36 and 38 yrs old and was BC free Â because these were the ages when my mom was dx and lost her battle with BC. ThisÂ cancer monster has WREAKEDÂ  HAVOC on my life for the last 33 years Â my mother with BC in 1982, my older brother in 2002Â non-Hodgkin's lymphoma( NED 13 years after a stem cell transplant). I am so ready to fight for my life.Â When I look at my daughter all I can do is cry becauseÂ I DO NOT EVER want her to experience what I experiencedÂ growing up withoutÂ a mother.Â To me that was the worst thing any child could experience, I would not wish that pain on anyone,Â because no matter whatÂ NO ONE Â in my opinion will love you like yourÂ own mother.Â  When my mother finallyÂ told me of her dx she promised sheÂ would be around to see me turn 18 sadly it never happened, so I amÂ determined to see my beautiful baby girl become a beautiful young lady and the thought of anythingÂ preventing that from happening just makes meÂ eager to go to war inÂ  this battle against the BC monster.Â Â  I have already started planning surgery. hoping I can have it done after returning from vacationÂ , so around the week of July 18th looks good to me. Prayerfully my ONCOtype is low so I will not have to do chemo but the core biopsy reading states I have a Nottingham grade of 3 which from research looks as if chemo is a strong possibility. Whatever the recommendations are I will do. But if the oncotype comes back suggesting chemo and if doing chemo Â only changes RS by a few percentages I am notÂ going to do chemo. Are there anyÂ moms out there with young children who did not go with the chemo recommendation? I just want things to mirror as close to normal for my daughter as possible. I don't want her to see me sick and hairless as a result of chemo if it is not going to make a big difference. Â  I am ready to fight ,and Â I am so afraid at the same time but Â it is nice to know I am not alone. Â  Is this normal for me to feel this way?Â Â Â Â  Log in to post a reply",
