My doctor says this has been sent and I will have to start the 2-3-or 4 week wait all over again. In the meantime no one seems to be sure whether I should start chemo or wait for this test result and I am confused as heck. Any ideas?",

The oncologist ordered the test on 7/10/13, 5 days after my double mastectomy and he said the results would take 3 weeks. The results still aren't here. Anyone else wait this long? I feel like I want to get on with it already...chemo or not and I don't like the feeling of sitting around waiting when I should maybe be doing something.

I didn't want to get in the middle of that. I'm really glad for this test, I certainly don't want chemo if I don't need it! I just hope they hurry up with my results already. I've been off work since June and am pretty well recovered from surgery but don't want to go back just to go back off again if I need chemo. What's ovarian suppression? I was told I'm definitely doing Tamoxifen and will need to keep a close eye on my fibroids which Tamoxifen might make worse... ",

I asked if there was any way they could rush it since it's now been over a month. The person I spoke with was nice enough but was very vague and could only say they were currently looking at it and wouldn't give me any estimate of when the results would be available.  The oncologist will only say that if I am to do chemo, as long as I begin within 3 months of the surgery it will be ok. Bleh. Yup, the waiting stinks.",

My surgeon told me I should do it no matter what the oncotype says due to my age (42). The onco disagrees and says wait for the test. I'll wait but I'm not happy about it;)",
