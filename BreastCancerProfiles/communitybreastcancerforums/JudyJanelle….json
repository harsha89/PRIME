Results of the MRI showed \"something \" in the right breast. I was presented many options, including biopsy of the right breast. I decided immediately to have a bilateral mastectomy. For me, it was as much about getting it all out of my body as it was trying to get the best symmetrical result. I am just 3 weeks post op with tissue expanders. It is a personal decision and you are entitled to listen to the panel and make the decision that YOU can live with. I felt this was the best decision for me.Remember it's your body, your decision. I know it is so hard waiting but once they present you with the results/recommendation then you become empowered and to me that provided a since of comfort. Knowing that yes, I my decision was aggressive but I needed the peace of mind I was doing everything within my power to get the cancer out of my body. By the way, it was cancer in the right breast as well. I also had the sential nodes removed and tested at surgery and all showed negative. At this time no other treatment is necessary. I am so grateful for that! I will keep you in my prayers, Judy",
