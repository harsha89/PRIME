It is my understanding that the lymph vessels take the infection and debris (cancer cells) to the lymph nodes which then be come infected and able to transfer the cancer (mestast) around to other body organs. It is the nodes that become swollen and these are found under your arm. Not in your breast. You are doing the right thing by getting a mamo, but you need to be under the guidence of a health specialist in this area also. Looking up things on the net and trying to self diagnose yourself is going to give you a very high anxiety level, but given the ER experience I dont blame you. The guy was a s#%t. If he felt competent to tell you you had cysts or cancer with out some form of scan/biopsy then he is as good as those cancer sniffing dogs and we all know that they are so good that the health department employs them on a regular basis, not. I feel your stress and have and still to a certain extent still am feeling the same fears. I have been waiting a result for over a month now and have to do my tests all over again as the first were inconclusive. All the girls have and still are feeling fear and anxiety of some degree. It dosnt matter how many times they have to get in line to await tests and results it is always with the same stress. They all understand what you are going through, this is the best place to come as they are so supportive. You are normal to feel the way you do, you are normal to try and find out what it could possible be as you just want to know so you can begin to deal with what ever. Well as leaf can tell you, 80% of lumps are benign, your chances of it being nothing are very high. Goodluck on monday and may you get some peace of mind. Start your run on first base and when you come over home plate may it be with the greastest ever possible results, B9. Warm hugs. Jaly",

Know that might not be everyones cup of tea. Unfortunately for me, I was in that small percentage that it didnt work for. They were unable to get a sample of tissue to test. My GP wants me to wait 4 months to repeat all over again. Not going to wait. I am going to go to Private Breast Clinic in nearest capitol city and see what thier opinion is. It is hard waiting and the what ifs and maybes send you mad as they dance around in your head. You only have to check others posts to see that everyone experiences what you are feeling, even if they are going through the cycle of  Dr-scan- wait-DR-test-wait-results-wait for the 20th time. The best place to vent or cry is to the people on this site. They are all so supportive, sometimes more than our family and friends. They relate to how you are feeling and what you are going through. Hope you results are swift and good ones.....Jaly",

Some of these lymph nodes are found in clusters in the underarms, groin, neck, chest and abdomen.

I missed it because my husband had a few drinks for breakfast so I had to drive . Didn't know where I was going he had to give me directions and because of the liquid breakfast the directions were wrong. Missed my first grandchilds christening. Lack of sleep and stress just made me totally lose it. Spat the dummy (pacifier) so far they will never find it. The good thing to come out of it is that I got rid of some of the tension and now feel like I want to sleep for a week. Craftygal, I believe that it isn't silly to have thought of your dh in regards to you friends dads passing. Very normal as you are worried about the possibility, due to your dh's lifestyle choices. Your Doc is right, nothing can be changed until that person is ready. I have been trying to get my husband to for ages. He is a alcoholic. Through all the struggles with this addiction the one important thing is that he is the only one that can make the choice to stop. He has had a stent put into one of his arteries, he has high blood pressure and he has liver damage, has been in and out of hospital, it frightens him while it is happening but it doesn't take long for him to think he is invinsible again when he comes out and feels alright. When my sister#2 passed away, I had the most awful dreams. I dream't that I would go to see my parents and other siblings and they would of packed up the whole house and moved without telling me. I had a lot of deams where she was with us still but was very fragile and sick. I had to look after her and I couldn't let anybody else do it as I was responsible for her. Before Xmas I dreamt that I was on a sailing boat and the weather was beautiful, she was there with a friend and she was happy and loved where she was. I havent had any bad dreams about her since. Strange how our subconscious sorts out our stress.Maybe and it is only a opinion, that because you are worried about what you are facing, it is comming out in your dreams in as loosing the people you care about most. I hope that Monday brings you some peace and if you find yourself up at 4am I will be listening, may not answer straight away but I am there. I do make myself sound like a episode of Days of Our Dreary's but its not really. I dont feel sorry for myself and I am no diff from the woman nextdoor. Just been given one of Gods little challenges to help me grow stronger.                                                          Jalydiju",

Over wanting to slap people but thanks for the assistance. The visual was great. If we all lived on the same continent and in the same area I definately would want to have coffee or something stronger with you all. Europe, France, Paris would be nice, somewhere on the left bank maybe. What would be your suggestion? Julz and Leaf, Yes some health proffessionals could use a course in Empathy 101. When sister#2 was hospitalizes with blood clots from opp to pin femur together after cancer had erroded it, some stupid Dr started to tell her about being on Warfrin and it causing the tumors in her lungs to bleed, which may make her start gurgling up blood. She just freaked. Noobody had told her re tumors in lung as she didnt want to know. Nursing staff knew and it had been written on her notes not to mention it. Sister #1 paniced and tried to stop him. What a nightmare, could of been avoided if the fool had just read her notes before talking to her. Julz, I am half way through studing to be AIN in Acute Care which could be the equivalent of your nurses aid. Hope to go on next year and become EEN. Endorsed Enrolled Nurse which means that I am qualified to make certain decisions and addminister certain medications under the direction of a RN.(Registered Nurse-use to be called Sister) At the moment AINs are only employed in Aged Care, they are going to be used more in hospitals but the course that I am doing is the first of its kind to train AINs for hospital use. So I guess I am one of the Guinea Pigs/Lab Rats. I hope to end up in Pallitive Care as after going through it all with my S#2, I would dearly love to be doing something about making a difference in someones life rather than trying to force jewellery down thier neck that they really cant afford. This is what I was doing before, it just didnt make sense to me anymore and I told the company to shove it up thier proverbial after they disciplined me for not going out and accosting people outside of the store.

She had MS. Mum and her older sister were raised by their Aunts. My grandmother came from a family of 13 children. Mum was a very shy and needy child and the Aunts didnt have time to molly coddle. My mums dad was alcoholic and also a betting man. Loved the horses and the dogs (Greyhound racing). If the horses or the doggies came in he would come home with goodies for everyone, if they didnt, then my mother and her sister would have to go down to the local pub and try and get him to come home. She met my dad when he became a boarder at her Aunts place as a trainee constable in the police force. Unfortunately he wasnt a sure bet and she was left to raise 4 little girls under the age of 10 all by herself with no financial help from my father. She like many single mums has had to face hard times but not once did any of her daughters miss out on anything. God only knows the sacrifices that she made for us. She is always there for any of us girls and she is the only person that can quieten me when things get out of control. She went through hell of having to make all the decisions for sister#2 when she was dx with stage 4 melanoma as my sister wanted no part of what was happening to her and placed it all on my mothers shoulders. Never have I seen her complain. I have seen her shed some tears when she has thought that we wernt looking. It has been my aim, to always, as a adult to be there for her. It is her that I wish to role model my strength on.  She is my hero. Jalydiju",

Your attitude is a real inspiration to others. On Julz comment re stevie I agree. The woman sounds distressed and probably needs a shoulder more than a scolding. Obviously not coping with what is going on with herself very well. Maybe a personal pm would of helped more than a public dressing down. Shame she hasnt posted since.",

It is unforgivable that you are being ignored and left hanging, it appears that the more you ring the more they are going to pretend that you arnt there. If their attitude is like this why on earth are they in a area that requires you to be empathetic while being sympathetic? You are a lot more well mannered than me as I would be down at his office this afternoon ready to rip both their heads off. Know this isn't appropriate behavior but I do have a terrible temper re injustice and lack of consideration and just ordinary old compassion.

Mine still wants nothing from me but I think he is getting info from his wife. She is a beautiful soul. It always amazes me the personal stories of every indervidual I meet. Everyone has a tale to tell and every tale is so very interesting. My heart goes out to both of your boys and yourself. You have definately had it tough but by the sounds of things you are a survivor and not a victim. It will hold you in good stead for what you are facing now, the strenght that you have to fight to get you through everything that has gone before will be there to fight what is yet to come, so the women here will be here to cheer you on. They will celebrate your victories and commiserate with you on your losses. They will hold you up when you feel like you are going to fall and they will let you fly when you need to with encouragement to soar.. My mum raised 4 girls by herself. The eldest was 10 when she walked out on my father. He was just a miserable son of a #$%&@. Like you she walked out without much, just what she had on her back and in her pocket. She struggled to feed, clothe and educate us. She swollowed her pride and lined up in welfare lines to get food to feed us and our clothes came from St Vincent De paul or Life Line never once did dear old dad help her. Not one red cent. She lost her mum to MS when she was 7 years old, she lost her 3rd daughter to Melanoma 5 years ago and she is currently nursing her partner of 20+ years who had a stroke around the same time my sister died. He isnt in good shape but she wont give up on him. Her only sibling is also very ill with liver disease, she runs between my stepdad and her because she believes you are always there for family. I dont know why I am telling you this except that I connect with what you have told us about yourself and suppose identify with you to a degree. I am glad to see you have some support in to keeping your home safe. It is great how people can rally together to help someone in need. I have seen it often with the people my husband works with when one of them or their family members are in crisis. I hope you get through all this testing soon and that you let people that care deeply for you, care for you. I also wish for your youngest that he gets the care and attention he needs and for your eldest that he finds calm and a way to be able to be at peace with what is happening to his wife and life. It is not easy to have to deal with mental illness and society views of it. My stepmother has bi-polar disorder and it has affected my youngest sister and her older sister, greatly. I am sorry if I have bored anybody and that this is so long, God bless you Toni and may he keep you in his care, Jaly",

He sleeps on the floor on my side of the bed and even when my husband gets up in the morning he wont go with him, he waits till I wake up. My husband is always saying that \"he definately your dog\". He was bought for my youngest son as a xmas present 5 years ago and when he left home he couldnt take him with him so like always mum had to take over. I just couldnt part with him now.

You need to take some regular short periods of time through the day and concerntrate on your breatheing. Take controlled deep breaths and fell your rib cage and diaphram expand, hold it for the count of five and then slowly exhale, do this about ten tiimes in a row saying to yourself, calm, let go, breathe.

I have been terrified by the possibilities of, if it is, to what could happen. I have questioned my femininity, I have questioned my sexual attractiveness and Ive questioned, the will I still be me?  Ask your mum to stand in front of the mirror naked next time she has a shower, then to imagine that tomorrow she will loose 1/2 of one of her breasts.

It is ok to morn what you have lost, you have been through so much already. You are a Warrior, continue to fight your battle. You will always be you, no matter the shape of the vessel which carries your essence. JAly",
