I discussed with my onc and she said it happens sometimes after chemo due to low immune systems, etc.  I had a hard time last year but I figured it was because I had no nose hair, lmao. Anyway, I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else, how bad was it and how long does it last?  I'm making an appointment to see an allergy doctor so hopefully I can get some relief.

One final note, the morning after surgery my PS came in and freaked me out by saying it was time to pull off the bandages.  Of course I had 15 pamphlets telling me that I should do that privately in front of the mirror or whatever so I was thrown off, LOL.  However, you can't beat starting your recovery by hearing your husband say \"That's not bad, hon, and they're going to look awesome when he's done.\" :) Just for that I think we'll stay married!

I hope this information was remotely helpful to you.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Best wishes, Diane ",

I hope this story wasn't misplaced but hoping you might get a smile out of it too. Good luck and keep in touch.  Diane ",

My path report was pretty encouraging also.  We knew there was lymph node involvement prior to surgery but the report showed 4 out 27 positive.  Me likey those odds. I also had my first round of chemo this past Friday.  Yesterday was not fabulous (it felt like a hangover and who didn't nurse of few or more of those in college?)  but today I'm feeling pretty good.  I understand it will get worse, but maybe if it just gets a little worse every time it won't be so bad.  And think of how great I'll feel when it's all over!!! With all of the treatment we are throwing at this my chance of recurrence becomes 10%!  How can I frown at that? I am more convinced than ever that I am a healthy woman who is doing everything I can to stay that way. That said, I am so thrilled that this thread took off like it did.  I have enjoyed each and every post, regardless if the opinion was similar or different to mine.  You are all incredible women coping the best way for you.

I will be giving myself the Neupogen shots after Taxol.  I could have done Neulasta but it was bad enough that I feel like it's worth trying something different.  Supposedly it's better because it comes in small doses. The wonderful thing about this thread is that I can always find someone who's on the same schedule/page with me. By the way, has anyone else experienced this?  My eyebrows have not fallen out BUT I haven't had to have them waxed in over a month.  Normally I'd look like Bert (of Bert and Ernie) but they've remained a really nice shape.  So they're not falling out but they're not growing back either.  Legs are the same way...I only have to shave less than once a week. Everyone feel good and take care of yourself. Diane ",

Jilly - would it make you feel any better to know that I am also having some soreness in that area on the BC side?  It's mostly when I lay down and, while I was a bit paranoid about it at first, I'm reasonably sure that it's just muscle soreness.  I don't feel it all the time, only when I lay on that side.  I wonder if we just favor that side or our body so much that we cause that \"tightness\"  Like you, I also had a clear scan in November! Renrel - Congrats on your last chemo!  Good luck tomorrow :) I had my TEs deflated this morning.  Only 200ccs each.  They actually look much better and natural because the skin is stretched so they look more \"relaxed.\"  Please send vibes that it's enough! Finally, I want to make an endorsement for the Mane N' Tail horse shampoo.  I'm less than three weeks out of chemo and this morning when I get out of the shower my hair was laying down (does that make sense?).  Granted it started to grow back some during Taxol.  Also, I have nothing to compare it to...BUT...my hair is growing back at a very fast rate.  I recommend it!!

The last few days have been very tough emotionally, mostly because I'm tired as hell.  While I'm thrilled that A/C is over I feel like I still have so much more ahead of me (Taxol/radition/port removal/implant exchange/gah!).  Also, I haven't mentioned it much but I'm still working about 35 hours per week.  I'm extremely lucky that I work from home and I'm a contractor so I have a bit of flexibility.  That said, the bills still have to be paid so I don't have much of a choice.  It's overwhelming sometimes! Like clockwork, every Wednesday or so after treatment the recurrence thoughts start creeping up, too (what if this is all for nothing? what if chemo is over and it comes right back? how would I ever do this again?).  I think it must be the culmination of everything.  I could almost set my watch by it!  I will need therapy desparately when this is all over.  Half the battle is admitting it, right?  LOL Wow, did this end up being a long post!!!  Thanks, as always for listening. I hope everyone else is feeling ok and having a good day! Diane",

I'm sorry to all of those who are having a bad time with S/Es.  Chemo is something, isn't it?  Just when you think you've mastered it you get a sucker punch.  Although Taxol has been much easier for me I can't relax thinking something random is going to hit me or that the dreaded \"cumulative\" effect will get me sooner or later. Speaking of random side effects, here's one for you.  I've lost all of my nose hair.  While I find it kind of amusing (as amusing as a chemo s/e can be) I think it's going to be a pain in the neck.  My nose is sort of burning, I guess because there's no filtering there...very weird.

Re: Ovaries, I've asked my onc if that was something I should consider.  She said that if the Tamoxifen doesn't stop my periods then I could actually do something to suppress them (shots, I think) rather than remove them.  I just think it's interesting how we all seem to get different advice on things. KM47 - Sorry you're in the hospital!  I hope you're out by Saturday.  Feel better! ddlat - Interesting about the Abraxane.  I do wonder what the doctor meant by \"twice as effective\", though.  I thought these treatments (in most cases) killed anything and everything that might be left in me after surgery.  But hey, if it will be easier on you and your insurance will pay, I say go for it! Jess - I can't believe that your doctors are giving you a hard time about having the other breast removed.  Lots and lots of MRI's?  Are they kidding?  It's your body, your decision.  It would make me more than a bit pissy.  By all means, pound your fist on the table and tell them that's what you're doing.  Ask your husband if he wants you to go through this again in 2, 5, 10 years and I'll bet he'll be on board with it :) Has anyone scheduled radiation yet?  If so, how long after chemo are you starting?  I'll be done April 17th.  I'd like to get started asap but am hoping I can put it off until after my little one is finished with preschool (May 22nd) just so I can get on a schedule without having to change it.

Thank goodness it's breaking for the summer.  DD really loves it...last night they did a tour through the chemo rooms, radition, etc.  It's been great for her.  I just don't think I can stomach the \"adult time\" anymore.  I suppose I could drop her off but I would feel tacky doing that.

Holtbolt, I totally hear you about your onc visit.  While she doesn't volunteer negative comments, my onc is not much of a cheerleader either.  And I agree, I think we all need that.  Maybe they are just covering themselves so we can't go back to them later and say \"you said I did great.\"  That would get me down too.  It will be interesting to see what my dr. does when I go back for my first follow up. I've been reading all the comments re: wigs and hats and I have to say I have a completely different perspective on the whole matter.  I don't wear a wig to make others comfortable.  I wear it to make myself comfortable.  I just don't feel like me without hair and knew I would wear a wig from the get go (I even threatened to sleep in it for a while.  That never happened, lol).  I've been extremely open about my situation and there is no one that knows me that doesn't know I've had chemo and am wearing a wig so I'm not trying to hide anything by wearing it.  I've never like to draw a lot of attention to myself and that's what I feel like going out bald or in a scarf would do.  With summer coming I know I'm going to figure out what I'm going to do as the SOB will be very hot on my head.  Anyway, just thought I'd add my perspective to the discussion! All of that said, my hair is starting to grow back with a vengeance!  It started about halfway through Taxol and now it's long enough to be laying down when I take my wig off (does that make any sense?).  I can't wait to see how it takes off when all of the Taxol is actually out of my body!  Maybe the Mane and Tail really does work!  I wonder if they make it for eyebrows!

But you have come to the right place.  The ladies (and few guys) here will be a great source of information and comfort to you as you go through this. For now just take a deep breath and get your bearings.  Or cry and scream and hit things.  Whatever you need to do! You've got a tough road ahead but you can do it. ((BIG HUGS)) Diane ",

One weird/funny thing that happened to me was when my eyebrows started growing back in I kept looking at myself in the mirror thinking \"something's weird\"  Then it hit me that my eyebrows were growing back in their natural state and I hadn't seen them ungroomed in almost 28 years!  Definitley a different look for me :)",

I do know that I need to become much more self-aware once treatment is over.  I've always been a \"suck it up!\" kind of person, just popping advils for headaches, etc.  I need to find a happy medium between that attitude and freaking out about every little ache and pain. Good luck to you both. Diane",
