The side effects of my radiation 22 years ago seem to keep on coming. July of this year I had my thyroid out, although it was not cancerous I had many growths, due to previous radiation. During that hospital stay I had a complication with my heart ( a mini heart attack), that brought to light I had a heart issue. I was found to have radiation induced coronary heart disease. The radiation from years ago had caused a 90 percent blockage to the heart. The location of the blockage was in a spot that required I have open heart by pass surgery. I'm two months from that surgery and healing well. My message to HD survivors is to be sure you are seeing a cardiologist, and your heart is monitored. I,ve been followed closely since the HD, by oncologist and primary care drs and no one suspected I had such damage to the heart .",

So I think it's a good investment, especially since you have a little chest pain..better safe than sorry. Kle  ",

In 2011 my thyroid and CABG year, was the year my oncologist and primary care doctor both ran a long list of survivor issues by me. I had the cardiologist's referral on paper, but had not been yet, when during my thyroid surgery, I had a heart issue. We take it one step at a time and get through it. Kle",

Maybe because this was a 2nd cancer,and for 18 years I lived with the what ifs... for every bump on my body..I certainly know I'm high risk still, and will work through whatever comes my way. Yes I'm anxious for mammograms..but I was before too,  I'm taking tamoxifen to help keep the good breast healthy.  I also have an implant, and I am uneven, but look fine in a bra.  I'm comfortable with that too. You have to weigh all the parts of this decision, and hopefully will find what works for you. Good luck. KLE  ",
