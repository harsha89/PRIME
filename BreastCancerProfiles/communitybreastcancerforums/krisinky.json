I had a mammo 3 months ago, found a lump, they didn't think anything of it but I insisted on a biopsy. It came back b9 but possible phyllodes, f/u mammo in 3 months. Well I went for my f/u on the 11th and the found another mass with slightly irregular borders which had not been there before. This time they recommended biopsy (panic attack). So now I have my biopsy tomorrow morning (wed 18th). The good thing I guess for me is that my clinic has an in house lab so I will know the results within 48 hours. The bad thing is that it wasn't there 3 months ago, irregular borders and that this time they insisted on the biopsy. I am in the process of getting a copy of my records, they didn't give me the BIRAD or the size etc. Which also tends to make me worry even more because last time they said, \"its 2 mm, looks like a fibroadenoma, its up to you if you want a biopsy\".",
