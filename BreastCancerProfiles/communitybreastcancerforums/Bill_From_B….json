We are definitely counting our blessings this Thanksgiving as my wife's tumor when discovered in May (she had had a mammogram in January!) was over 8 cm.  The saving grace was that it had not invaded the chest wall and we got right to the chemo within three weeks of discovery.  The TCH chemo just melted that thing away, even if it was tough getting through it.  Two things we learned from this board that helped: 1) at the first sign of acid reflux we started on omeprazole, and  2) stool softeners were used from day 1.   Thank all of you posters on this board for all your insights.",
