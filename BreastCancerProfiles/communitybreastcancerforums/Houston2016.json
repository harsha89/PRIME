Anyway, the cough was scarce at first then now October it became more prevalent. I have not using cough drops, I feel some chest pressure once in awhile like you have a book on your chest.

My OC suggested I talk to the surgeon about this. I told her I just went through two surgeries in the span of 8 weeks with continuous fever and bad reaction to the antibiotics. I am not going to subject myself to more surgery because the guy screwed it up. I initially did not have a good impression about the BS. Why didn't the OC said anything to me about the PATH report? So more surgeries take out more lymph nodes for what ? Wouldn't radiation supposed to kill those lymph nodes? I'm exhausted with these doctors giving me the run around and they are more try to cover each other up than looking out for my care. Is there another alternative than surgery?

The BS based on this told me the lymph nodes were negative because tissue were blasted by chemo. Later this week, the same RO called my OC to let her know that I need to have surgery AGAIN to get more lymph nodes out. Apparently she didn't think my BS did the right job. This RO said standard practice is to get 10 lymph nodes out. I cannot believe this, I was already having hard time with the surgery on 10/5 and the reexcision on 10/24, it has been 8 weeks since first surgery. I was preparing for radiation. Now this? How can they play game with my life and want to open me up when they want? If in fact the BS did not do the lymph nodes why the OC not telling me? They are all covering for each other and I have to pay the price? What is the significance of removing 2 or 6 lymph nodes out. Isn't radiation supposed to kill those nodes?

What I'm worry about is my low WBC count (3.3) last one done in April 25 and my last rads was Jan.31. Does it take this long for WBC back to normal? Also, my MO saw me once on April 25 didn't say or do anything about my cancer.. only oh, I'm supposed to have all this aches from hormone pills, and tells me to see PCP about my rash. She didn't mention about any kind of scan, nothing, not that I want it but she doesn't seem to be on top of preventive measures. I'm thinking of switching MO doesn't seem to have my best interests at heart. It seemed like once you're done with chemo and they made money, you're no longer on their radar. BTW, talking about neoadjuvant chemo I had them in April 2016 and by 09/01/16, it didn't reduce much and I also had calcification in the initial biopsied. My tumor was initially 3.3 so given that lumpectomy would not an option, so this MO told me to do chemo first so it can reduce the tumor and that it's a trend now to \"save the breast\". If you already know my breast cannot be saved then why need to do chemo first? I regretted that I allowed it to happen cause I didn't know better. I believed having neoadjuvant chemo may cause me to have LVI when they did the mastectomy in 10/5/16 which I think may not be there to begin with. I wish surgery would be done first then I wouldn't have that LVI issue. Now it leads me to think about recurrence. How many of you have scanning after your treatment? How long apart?

I don't have stage IV but since joining this site I read many posts from amazing women stage 4 who say they are living life, working, etc.. with triple negative I know there are target therapy to treat stage 4 and some women even have NED. Does their ability to overcome stage 4 is their strong emotional well-being, physical, their lifestyle, eating habits, chemo drugs, alternative treatment, or a combination of everything? Yet I still see a few cases on the news or in real life where the women have stage 4 recurrence and Dr said chemo is no longer working for them. So what does this mean? WH to target therapy drug? I can understand if the women chose not to continue with chemo or sometimes cancer cells are resistant to chemo. Have anyone knows about Fucoidan, a seaweed/mushroom herbal that were tested and proven in labs to kill cancer cells. They originated from Japan their known all over the internet but not many people know how or where to order. I just happen to have their website and phone number if anyone interested. I have a supervisor whose wife was cancer free for eight years. Recently she got dx with stage 4 recurrence and her doctors said no more chemo no more cure. So she just died yesterday. I thought with the new and improved drugs people are surviving with bc. Am I missing something here? All the best to you ladies. ",

Anyway, I been sick with a cold since May 2, then bronchitis, after that, for several weeks. I went to PCP and mentioned the waist discomfort. So I done the lumbar X-ray results showed Moderate Osteo-arthritis. PCP told me to take Alleve ?? BTW I have a history of degenerative disk disease back in the 90's I guessed caused by the epidural received during childbirth. So I went home and did some research on bone loss. BTW, all this aches come up when I started taking Anastrozol since 11/2016. So now my bone loss is another issue that possibly aggravated degenerative disk disease. I found the ad about Strontium Citrate. So I've taken since early May along with Calcium. My OC said it doesn't hurt to try it. I have another issue after my coughing stopped. I had a UMX in 11/16 but did not have recon so I still have the TE on my left chest. A couple of days ago I felt sensation under the base of the TE, then the next day I noticed the swelling near the left armpit and fluffiness under it. I planned to get an US to check it out. But I just went to see the OC for physical exam Monday, 06/04 and I guess it wasn't swelling then otherwise she should have said something. Another I wanted to ask my OC is if I can have the tumor marker blood test. I have read about and seen people with early stages BC have it done. My OC just find every which way to deny me the tumor marker test. She said insurance might not cover it unless I show symptoms or I have Mets. Is this true? Why some drs do them and some don't. I know TM is not 100% but it could raise a red flag. Thanks for all inputs.",

The RO from MD Anderson said she have me wear a goggle and it let me see how far down my heart is away from rads when I hold my breath. When I mentioned that the first RO said that can create error. They both seemed to be credible and qualified but my priority is to avoid rads affecting my heart at all cost, given bc was in my left breast. RO also said it will hit the lung 20%.

I also have pains on legs, upper part of my abdomen, and tension headache. I don't vomit and still eating OK. Then I started to research on my symptoms because I had fever before but never headaches. I found that I may have Lyme disease, bacteria infection from ticks bite. My cats do have lots of fleas, I also have 3 round circular rashes on my inner thigh between March to April, thought it is ringworm so didn't do much. Now Lyme disease I read has similar rash.

I had chemo AC+ Taxol April-September, left MX in 10/5 but had a RE-excision in 10/24 so I'm almost done with recovery, but I researched about the criteria for radiation with mastectomy is when you had 5-6 cm tumor plus lymph node biopsied positive. So in my case I will definitely have rads on lymph nodes, the chest wall not sure cause my tumor was 3.3 cm. But it also depends on the grade of your tumor and types of cancer.

Here is my entire story: Dx in April with er+pr+, 2b, my team of drs are from Kelsey Seybold, the OC, Dr.R, BS, Dr.B, and the RO, Dr. D. I finished AC and Taxol April-September 01. Prior to chemo, I had an axillary biopsy, biopsy of the large mass, 3.3 cm, and some calcification which were DCIS, and a lymph node biopsied at superclavical. Result is one positive axillary lymph node, and tumor mass, and calcification. So after chemo, I went for LB MX on 10/5, (Dr. B performed a simple MX, had the dye went in, removed 2 sentinel lymph nodes) the PATH report came back two weeks later, I met with Dr. B. To discuss: he said the lymph nodes came back negative, he said that's good news because that's very important. OK, he said the chest tissue however, showed a tiny dot of cancer cell up on the edge so it's positive margin. On a side note, my Dx was tumor 6\" above the nipple. I also have LB ultrasound done on 6/13 and 08/23/16. No other biopsies done. So I consent to do second surgery to get a clear margin which took place 10/24. I met with Dr. B on 11/2 to discuss PATH, this time no sign of cancer cell. He did cut out more skin, and my PS, Dr.Bl puts in a tissue expander, both times. So everything was good and I consulted with Dr.D for rads but I also went to see Dr. A, RO from MD Anderson, on 11/11 for second opinion, and maybe to do rads there. I sent records there for review. Dr. A reviewed my PATH from 10/5 without the Dr. B operative report. She told me it looked like Dr. B didn't take any nodes out. I told her that's not possible, I read the report and it stated Dr.B submitted 3 specimens, left breast mastectomy, left axillary sentinel lymph node, and left breast mastectomy skin. At the end of the report, it says lymph node, sentinel, left axillary, excision: fibrovascular tissue with no lymph node identified. The lymph node summary said: Total number of sentinel lymph nodes:0 total number of positive sentinel lymph nodes:0 total number of non-sentinel lymph nodes:0 So I don't really know why it stated zero and the Dr. Report described his removing small lymph nodes within the axilla. Anyway, Dr.A from MD Anderson may have different views and she called my OC,from Kelsey to request for another surgery. So here I am don't know who's right and who's not. I want to ask Dr. A what's the benefits of getting more lymph nodes if I'm going to do radiation? Is someone look at this at a different angle? After having hard time recovery, I just don't want to subject myself to unnecessary surgery, for what purpose? Do you think another biopsy is needed at this point? Thanks for all your inputs and concerns.",

It may be true to some point that the number of Asian women are less compared to Caucasian and Africans. We don't really know why, it could be genetic or it could be environment.

I never suspected to have breast cancer even living here because I don't drink, smoke, not a sugar person, eat meat mostly fish or chicken. I personally suspected how I get breast cancer now that I researched about the causes and risks so looking back I know why I have it. It's true Asian women are smaller, not drinking milk or eating cheese or butter, and western food are more fattening. However to pinpoint on race, culture, or food to diagnosed cancer is silly. It is an individual disease that means you have to look back on what you've done, and what you can change for the better and move forward.",

I have left side mastectomy in 11/16 and rads in12/16 through 01/17 and drs said the only reconstruction I can do is diep flap which I still have not done. I still have TE on.
