It is some ride, it isn't it?? jblcsw10 - You are close by; love your beaches! I went to UCH; my BS and PS are Cox/Albear. I think my Cox is your BS' younger brother  I tried the half-Vicodin thing but it still made me fuzzy. got the Darvocet today and - I've only taken one - but so far so good. Seems to work better for me than the Vicodin. almagetty - The Tamoxifen decision is a tough one for sure. I don't have a history of cancer (of any kind) in my family  - my BC stunned us all! - so I really didn't like that Tamoxifen increases risk of other cancers especially since it doesn't guarantee that it won't occur in my other breast. Hopefully I made the right call! I think I stretched/strained the incision where my drain was last night. Woke up in the middle of the night b/c of a sharp pain as I was changing positions. It looks a bit raw and was definitely tender today but the PS says it should be fine. BTW, I was told not to use Neosporin or similar ointments on it as that can slow the healing. Thanks, all, for the warm welcome and advice on the heat, pain, underarm puffiness, etc. Unfortunately I guess we just have to live with the latter since we're all being told the same thing. (Oh the things we've come to accept as \"normal\" !) One more day down and I think I won!",

My PS originally said would have to do an expander but got in and was able to do the implant (i'm a large B/small C before so we were all surprised). Had skin sparing, nipple saving mx and nipple biopsy came back clean (so far), and lymph nodes also negative.  I'm tired, and have some swelling and numbness under my arm, but figure that's par for the course .... The mx decision was tough but feeling now like it was the right way to go. Dealing with numbness, swelling, some pain, fatigue, and also trying to figure out how to shower!!! I've been following along for a bit now just was never sure what/when to post, but then just decided I wanted to say \"hi\" and thanks for all of your tips and positive thinking! This string and many others are helping me through a very difficullt time. You're truly an amazing group of women!",

It's terrible I guess, but it's nice to know I'm not alone and that what I'm experiencing (pain etc.) is normal.  UMX with immediate implant was on 6/29 and I thought I'd be off the heavy pain meds by now.  Silly me!! Drain came out on Friday 7/8 (yeah!), and I've been trying to wean myself from Vicodin primarily because I hate the way it makes me sluggish and my head fuzzy. PS and I agreed I'd try Aleve and just use Vicodin at night, so I've been doing that for last couple of days but have to take so many Aleve (2 every 4-5 hours) now I'm nauseous much of the time. PS said we can try Darviset (sp?) if Aleve didn't do the trick so I plan to call him tomorrow to give that a try. Is anyone else using Darviset? Also, has anyone tried applying heat to the area? I have and it seems to help a bit. I'd love any other suggestions for managing the pain. When does it end? I'm tired of being in pain - although it's not severe, it's constant and irritating and - uh - painful . (And when I complain I feel like such a witch for not just being grateful the cancer is gone!) On another note, BS and I discussed and I opted not to take Tamoxifen. Side effects seem too risky to me since it only reduces the risk of cancer in the other breast and I/they will be monitoring that much more closely now anyway. Although I had multi-centric cancer in UMX breast, BS was comfortable with my logic since nodes, nipple biopsies etc. came back clean. I realize not the right decision for everybody but just thought I'd share my thought process. Went to the museum with my kids and nieces and nephew today. Whew! Okay, so probably bit off a lot more than I can chew but sometimes, when I feel almost normal (when the pain meds are working) I forget I'm still recovering. Spent the last several hours passed out in bed! Won't try anything like that again any time soon! Liz - hope you can get your drains pulled sooner. A nurse pulled mine. It's quick and has made a huge difference for my comfort! (Just think, showers with no extra appendages!) Plus, like MRDRN mentioned, my PS was pretty clear that it's a possible source of infection if they stay in too long (his standard was less than 30 ccs for at least 48 hours and trending down). As I said, I don't write often, but I'm always reading. Your posts have made a ton of difference for me and I can't thank you all enough! Hope everyone has a good night!",

I think all any of us can do is take one day at a time. Know that you are not alone. I will keep you in my prayers.  I'm going to be calling my PS today too to ask about this underarm puffiness (dare I call it swelling?). They kept telling me last week that it's \"normal\" but it's driving me nuts! I feel as if my arm is sticking off like a sumo wrestler! Happy Monday everybody!",

I've been catching up on the posts and am so happy to see that things are moving along for you! Lizziemack - congrats on the drains being gone! Jeanne - I hope you have a wonderful weekend! My weekend away worked wonders for my spirits. Almagetty - way to go on your last fill! I had immediate implants so haven't had the TE experience myself, but your comment about a ift for the \"real\" side struck a chord!  I've been trying to figure out how much I care that they're not even since a good bra will do the trick. On the other hand not sure how that works in something with less support, like sun dresses which I love. Hmmm ... I seem to be healing pretty well, although my incision has been more sensitive/ itchy over the last few days. I think my body is also sick of the 24/7 bra since I just can't seem to get comfortable. I'm constantly tugging at the band (and sticking guaze padding between my \"real\" nipple and the bra). Ah well, I see my PS next Friday so hopefully I get out of the bra more. Have a great day ladies!",
