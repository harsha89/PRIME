It will take about a week for the results, I\u2019ve been told the odds as well, but it really isn\u2019t helping with my worrying. I had a TVH 2.5 years ago and the recovery was hard, so the idea of another surgery is weighing in on me as well. Try to relax, as far as the biopsy itself, it really wasn\u2019t bad at all",
