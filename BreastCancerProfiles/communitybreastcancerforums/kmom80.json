So now it's a little bigger almost dime size and still dark purple. No other breast changes. I'm really starting to worry BC it's getting bigger and not going away and on a vein. I called the breast clinic and they said maybe look into seeing a dermatologist but that insurance wouldn't approve any more imaging right now. Any thoughts? IF it was IBC surely it would have grown a lot more by now. Would appreciate any insight as to what this could be? No lumps. No angry lymph nodes. Occasional stabbing pains. Log in to post a reply",
