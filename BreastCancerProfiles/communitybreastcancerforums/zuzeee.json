He told me to shave off my hair before it falls out which it is starting too, he thinks there is less trauma doing that than waiting for it to fall out. Only big problem is wig is still not here, due to arrive tomorrow so my hair is going to stay for another day. I think you need to say to yourself that by doing chemo and rads you are killing the bas***d cancer cells, so think of chemo and radio as your friend rather than treating it as the enemy. It works for me . Stay positive and hold your head high and exercise is good for you. Go for a walk. Yoga is also good.  I surround myself with friends, mainly girls!!!, who make me laugh and we drink wine and just talk. I have asked my friends to send me funny email jokes so I can have a good laugh every day. Deep breathes and lots of pink bubble hugs to all. I see the group is growing in numbers. We need a name girls suggestions wanted.",

By the time I combed it out, and cut out the matts it looks thin. Still can't buzz it off although a friend is organising a hairdresser to do it tomorrow. I have already shed lots of tears and no doubt there are more to come. This seems to be the hardest part. Saw my oncologist on the 12th June and she was amazed at my lack of SE and how good I felt. Woud not give me sleeping pills but told me to drop taking the corticostreoid next time. 2nd infusion on the 16th June. Big hugs to all Susie",

I told them it was not a fashion statement and pulled some of my hair out to say this is why I am wearing it.  I shocked a few of them!!!! but it made me laugh at their reactions. Off for 2nd dose in a few hours. My onc has suggested that I can stop taking the corticosteroid this time round as I could not sleep  with it last time round. She will only prescribe melatonin for sleeping and nothing else. I don't think it works Big warm pink bubble hugs to all Susie ",

JustMary I am on AC and it takes about 1.5 to 2 hours for the process. I think a few minutes is probably wrong, sorry. Gjlanders I think I would check my white blood cell count before I left on a trip to Italy. If the wbc count is really low I would exercise caution, if okay go for it. Remember Italy will always be there for you. My wbc count on Day 18 was only 0.06, which is very low, but I felt great and went away for the weekend but took with me my note for hospitals that tells them  that in the event of running a fever you must be admitted to A & E immediately  for a white blood cell count as your immine system is impaired. Are you having the N shot? Today has not been great. Day 3 after 2nd chemo. My onc told me to drop the drug Dexamethasone as last time round I felt very wired and could not sleep. So I have not taken it but am still  not sleeping, been given melatonin to sleep, does not seem to work very well. Anyway went to work and was verbally abused in foul language by a tenant. I am a Property Manager. Managed to get back to the office, broke down in tears and came home. I wish I had pulled my wig off in front of the abusive tenat and yelled at her \" If you think you have problems, look at this\" I wish I had now. To watch  their reaction would have been a laugh. Met someone today who did not recognize me with the wig. Hmm this is an interesting experience and certainly challenges the concept of Who am I? . Lots of hugs to all of you. Susie",

Have you looked at the April / May posts. They are brilliant and full of words of wisdom and encouragement. Waiting is the hard part. Ny nurse said to me yesterday just before the IV went in - it is like starting a journey where you cannot see the bridge whilst you wait - but now you can see the bridge. I visualised a bridge covered in flowers and golden posts with cold buckets of champagne along the way. I was very happy to step on to that bridge and to think that I could travel it safely, knowing that I am not alone and that I am going to make the best of it that I can - sing, dance , cry but always laugh. Thinking ofyou and wishing you pink bubble hugs Susie",

It is very interesting being in the May Marvels and June Bugs. Different stages, different reactions and I am between the 2. Feeling very emotoinal and p***sed off with the world today. I was also asked if I would like a 2 month leave of abseence with no pay today. What for, I asked ? No, I like work sometimes, it can drive me mad but it does stop me thinking about myself and the trials and tribulations we are all going thru. If you can, have a look at the May group to see what is ahead, yeah lots of fun and laughter!!!. Joan have a wonderful time in Rome, I am green with envy. My new bf, the wig had to stay on all night man!!!,  has asked me to go to Australia for a golf week, well if you can go to Rome maybe I can go to OZ.( Australia) Let me know how it goes please and I do hope your daughter enjoys Rome. I spent 6 years in Rome and I loved it. Have a fab holiday everyone. Picture of Di would be great Tom. Lots of pink hugs to you all Susie",

Today is Day 15 since first chemo and my hair is beginning to fall out, yikes no sign of the wig yet. Have any of you been to a Look Good Feel Better session? Worth going just for the goody bag but also tips on eyebrows. I have been really well on A/C. Poor sleep has been the major SE which gets hard when you are also working and looking after family but it is doable. We need to think of a name for the June group. May is the May Marvels, so thinking caps on girls.  Have a wonderful day. Off to meet my radio Dr today, I hope he has sense of humour. Pink bubble hugs to all of you. Susie ",

I am so lucky to have 4 great girlfriends that really do care and help keep my spirits up and laugh and cry with me. I am single and the new boyfriend is still new!! so I don't really share too much with him. If I did I think he would think he had met an emotional roller coaster, which is the truth.

I had to have chemo cuz it was triple negative.   Last chemo next week, yay can't wait!! Am sooo looking forward to it being over. Re hair mine is growing, have to shave my legs, my armpits and still tweeze pesky facial hair, Very inconsiderate of my body I think. My head hair is longer, darker and yep like peach fuzz. Don't know if I should leave it or shave it off so I can start with a new head of hair again. I can't believe the number of people who comment on my hair, wig!! I now burst out laughing and tell them that my hair will never look like the wig, it is too fine. Looks like I could be wearing this wig for a long time!! Haha.

But having said that I managed to play 18 holes of golf on Sat & again on Sunday and I walk the course which is hilly. But it is in the early hours of the morning and I am awake again so that could easily explain why I am tired all the time.My final AC is on the 30th July, 3 days time and I can't wait for it!!!  Bizarre but I just want it over and done with. Then I wait a month and then have 35 doses of radio treatment. It is every day for 5 weeks. I initially planned to work and commute every day to Hamilton which is a 2 hour drive from where I live in the country. I have now decided that it is not a feasible option as I will just be tooo tired. Now I am going to work on Monday , go for treatment in the afternoon and stay in Hamilton on Mon, Tues, Wed & Thursday nights, work on Friday and be home on Fri, Sat & Sunday nights. Not looking forward to it as I love being in my own bed with my dogs!!!! I am hoping to stay with a friend of a friend as staying in the hostel with other sick(?) people does not appeal at all!! Interesting to know that once the boob is nuked it can't be done again. I am not getting Taxol as my onc does not think I need it. Fingers crossed that this is the first and last time I have to deal with this health issue. I was told that by doing chemo & rads the chance of a reoccurence was reduced from 25% to 15% so only a 10% reduction but I decided that I was going to kick it in the arse. I certainly would kick myself if it reoccurred and I had not gone thru chemo & rads. Heres hoping, but it has certainly taught me a lesson. I now enjoy every day and I don't sweat the small stuff and I tell people what I think, even if they don't want to know!!!! I have also found out what a great group of friends I have. New boyfriend said to get fit I should eat less choc & drink less wine!!!! today at golf. I fumed up the 18th hole, told a friend what he said, had a great laugh. I sent him an email saying choc & wine can make me fat but certainly nothing to do with fitness!! I received an apology and he said he forgot that I was doing chemo and that was why I was not fit!!  I replied that 2 rounds of 18 holes of golf was amazing at all, considering I always walk our hilly course. Honestly men can be sooooo stupid at times!!!!! My folks thought he was very impressive!!! and a gentleman. Well he did push my trundler and clubs up the hills on the last 4 holes. Hmmm,he better be more careful about refering to my weight and choc & wine consumption. I am not fat but yes could do with losing around 10 pounds. I have managed to stay the same weight through out chemo, but was determined I was not going to put on any weight. How are you all doing with your weight? Pink Hugs Susie",

Not sure about when you can re do them but would have thought after day 14 from last chemo dose would be fine. Tuesday here now.!!!! Thurday just round the corner, last treatment!!! Yipeee. Going to see new bf on Wednesday.He keeps asking when it is going to be all over. Think I have told him at least 3 times that the party is Oct 10th and thats when it is all over, I think and hope. Soo good to have a final date in mind. I see some of you also have final dates in mind and a cruise booked. How wonderful is that, green with envy down here!! Lotsa Pink Hugs to all. Susie",

My advice is to get your blood results done the day of or day before next chemo. I had mine done 4 days prior to Chemo and they nearly sent me away as the white blood cell count was to low. I asked and got a new blood test. WBcells went from 0.06 to 2.6 in 4 days. They will not infuse if count is under 2 and I live an hours drive away from hosp. I won't do that again Glad to see the the girls who have just started are reasuring everyone. Does anyone else have it infused in their hands? I was not given a port and it seems okay to me. Pink Bubble Hugs to all Susie",

Having all of you in this chat room has made a huge difference for me, lets one rant, vent, share and send positive vibes and thoughts to all us on the trip. I faced the world of work again and survived. Spent a fortune today, bought new curtains, want a new bed, bought a new picture and some wonderful bling gold earrings. I am now surrounding myself with pretty, colorful sparkly things, I even opened some pink bubbles by myself to have a glass on my own!!! Tasted too acidic but I forced it down. Life is for living so now I am grabbing it with both hands and I am going to live with joy in my life. Negative problem people are not going to be part of my life, even if they are family. I do not have time for them any more. So everyone that is my thought for the day. Anyone else feeling this way? Chemo and cold - I managed my last chemo with a cold, still have a very dry cough which I can't shake off. Keep rowing girls we will win. Pink hugs Susie",

I am in a hotel in Hamilton as I was too exhausted by 6. 30pm last night to drive home again!!! Very expensive this disease!!!! they won't let you stay at the hostel on a casual basis so hotels it will be or I must talk to some more mates over this way again !! Amazing the number of people I am resurrecting from my past on Facebook and by phoning them again!!! This hotel the Ibis is okay at $110.00 per night  NZ dollars not US!!! So I am going to ring the hosp and see if I can get an appt this morning and then go home, bit daft to come all the way back for my 5 pm appt. Fingers crossed I can get in.I am finding rads easy, little fatigue and I am getting stronger every day. Onc told me that chemo is out of the system in 48 hours but it will take me 3 months to recover my energy level and physical fitness level. I am thinking about pole dancing!!! Just seen that a 58 year old grannie is doing it and competing world wide, from Tauranga so reckon that would get me fit and provide a lot of laughs at the same time!!!! TomnDi keep going, life sounds tough for you both, my thoughts are with you. Have a wonderful Wednesday. We are now in Spring time in NZ . Yipeee Pink hugs Susie",

Has anyone thought about that ? or do you know the answer? Going to Auckland later today, it is 4 am and I can't wait for the day to start. like a kid in the candy shop. Reckon it is the steroids!! and that I am so happy. Talked to a friend who is a radiologist, because I want to go to a golf tournament which will clash with last 2 rad treatments, she advised me to request them to increase the dosage to hurry the process up. I know when I met the radio onc dr he said it could be done over a 3 week time frame. but he thought I had big boobs, size 12 DD about a 36 inch, I don't think they are big!!! it would be spread over 5 weeks, so on Monday I am going to convince him that 4 weeks is more than enough time to do this, plus I need to work!! Staying in Hamilton will be expensive, shoe shops, movies, restaurants, golf courses, I am looking forward to it girls!!! Have a great weekend all.

I went to my Dr and saw my breast nurse as one of my best friends and my Mum thought I was going mental and becoming very aggressive which is not in my nature!! Well it is now !!! Pronounced fully sane by both professionals. This is a life changing experience and it makes you reprioritise your life. I have quit my job as a Property Manager and leave work on the 30th Sept. With the benefit of hindsight I probably should have quit before starting rads. All this travelling, I have now clocked up 2000kms in 2 weeks!!!!, plus trying to work, set up my new business,trying to take care of elderly parents and now the new man in my life has bronchial pnuemonia has taken its toll. I no longer suffer fools gladly and I speak my mind. I tell people I can't wait in shops because I am on  a parking meter so get on with it!!!. I told a restaurant off for serving me a chicken salad which was covered in a thick rich coconut cream, no mention of that on the menu!!!  I am more assertive but I am finally calming down. My body and mind have been stressed to the max and I have found some things very hard to deal with particularly noise!!! I have walked out of restaurants 3 times in the last 2 weeks, as there were babies crying, which I can't tolerate at the best of times!! or the coffee machine and clatter of crockery was too loud or even the music has been awful and too loud. Do you see the picture of intolerance, but I cope. I take myself out of the situation and calm down again. Lots of deep diaphramagtic breathing going on!!! and holding my palms together.  A great head calm down is to put one palm on your forehead and the other palm on the backside of your head. Keep the palms aligned and breathe. It works wonders very quickly.  I am thinking about all of you. We are all at different stages and different diagnosis but I do know that I have loved talking to all of you and I will be here with you for a long time yet. I was given a brochure on coping after cancer, seems depression and bereavement are common. Yikes!! I have been given the option of counselling which I am taking up as I do feel I need to talk to someone about this new me, all rather strange but life is going to be very exciting and full of fun and laughter from now on in. No more hanging about waiting for life to start, as I now realise it is finite so enjoy it girls and take no flack from anyone. Huge pink diamond hugs from Susie in New Zealand where Spring and new life is underway.",

Went for sumualtion and planning yesterday. Wow getting a boob tatoo hurt!! needle directly into boob. Have been doing a lot of ranting and raving on Facebook and in the world. I have become very assertive, intolerant and tell people exactly what I think, in some cases with very little diplomacy!! Must be steroid rage, or that is the story I am sticking to. I have to leave home for rad treatment. The nearest city is 2 hours drive and I can't physically, mentally do it daily. Will work Mon  & fri and stay in Hamilton on other nites. Will miss my bed, folks, dogs & farm but am determined to have a good time. Just know it is going to cost a forune to amuse myself in Hamilton!! Rads start end of August. I will be here girls thru out rads, so chins up and smile and kick arse if you want to. I have my red boot days and people know Iam on  a war path so behave. Keeps me smiling,hehehe.

I still enjoy my wine, my golf and due to you whizzing off to Rome I have decided that I can also go on a holiday at the end of August before rads start, so thank you for that inspiration. Spent the night awake watching Wimbledon, a great match. Now I have to think about getting out of bed and into work. Wishing all a wonderful Monday and hoped you enjoyed your holiday. 3rd chemo is on Thursday. Hugs Susie  ",

I highly recommend you all go see a Counsellor. Mine explained that we are all in acute grief and so we are all going through the grieving process for losing a part of our body. It is easier to handle the emoions when you understand that they are natural. I am finally calming down, getting out of the angry stage!!!!, and feeling more positive and healthier. I still get tired at the end of the day. I became exhausted with rads but that was because I had to drive 5 hours a day every day plus I was working!!! Rads it easy compared to chemo. Just take it easy and take time out for yourself every day. Let others help you when they can. Long weekend here, finally moving my belongings into my own home. It has been a mission getting my house back in order, painters, builders, plumber & electrician!! Nearly finished. Pink hugs to all Susie xx ",

Everything in moderation is my motto, altho I do try to eat lots of fruit, veges, salad and lean meat. I think Soya is an overrated food product. You need to find out who is producing it and promoting it as an alternative to milk. Money will always be the motivating factor. Lovely to see you on facebook. Thanks for joining.

Hmm well I need to tell you that I am still shaving my legs etc... and no free Brazilian yet, that is after 2 lots of A/C.plus tweezing pesky hairs.!!!!!!!!!! Seems odd that it only gets the head hair. Has anyone stopped shaving their legs? I did not know about using hair dye for a year. Do you know why?

Pink is my favourite colour, so everyone has to wear something pink, including the men!! I could have a pink bald head and take my wig off and scare everyone. HAHA. My last rad treatment if all goes to schedule is the 9th October. It is wonderful to have the end in sight now and to begin the count down. Had terrible stomach pains yesterday and now getting mouth sores, I thought I had got off too lightly juding by some of the SE you girls are getting. Fortunately never had the N shot so no bone pains. Sounds positively ghastly.  Back at work, one of our staff members quit on Monday and the other 2 are off on holiday next week for 2 weeks so work is going to be harder & longer, not looking forward to that. Have a wonderful Wednesday everyone. I like being first in the world to wake up each day!!! Pink Hugs to all Susie",

I tell them it is a wig and why. Not for self pity, but when my own hair grows back it will not look like this. Mine is fine hair. I am beginning to enjoy wearing it and it does give me confidence to kick ass when required. Back from 3rd Chemo toady. They gave me 20g of Dexmethasone!!! the steroid drug. No wonder I get wired. Told me to take 4 mg instead of 8 for the next 3 days. Will give that a go.And the onc nurse said I may have to go back after rads for more chemo???News to me so will have to make further enquiries. The new man Ian has asked me to play golf in a mixed pairs comp on Sunday and then said he would like me to cook dinner,not b***dy likely - He can take me out, but am still worried about the sleep in same bed bit!!!!!! and what to say or wear- wig/hat/scarf. What are you girls sleeping in? Is anyone else in this situation? I will not allow him to see me bald, I barely cope & the dogs are not amused!!!! & it is freezing cold at night. Thinking of all of you Hugs Susie",

Deb I do understand about the hair and I did notice that you seemed happier and am soooo pleased that they gave it to you. There is love and compassion in the world at times, but sometimes we must ask for it and wow I am now palying the cancer card as my Get out of jail card, in Monopoly. It works brilliantly, try it girls. I love my wig and I think I will always wear at times. I am never going to have a bad hair day  ever again. I have also decided that I am never going to do this trip again. My solution will be found in champagne!!!! if it is ever required again, which I do hope is not the case, but hey there is a 15% chance of a reoccurence for me within the next 3 years!!!

I now stay 2 nights a week in a hotel in Hamilton as the driving is too tiring for me and it seems a bit daft going backwards and forwards every day. It is  a 5 hour round trip!!! Wine, well I have drunk it all the way through and it never was a problem. My oncologist recomended it!!!! so glad to see you girls back enjoying the wine. I played in a 72 hole golf tournament on the weekend and Terry & I, my golfing partner, we won all of our 4 matches. I am so thrilled with myself as it proves I am on the mend. Every day I feel stronger both physically and mentally. Hang on in there girls, the end is getting nearer. For me it is the 28th September.  I My op was on the 20th April, so 5 months has whizzed by.  My only persistant side effect is my inability to sleep well every night. Mostly only 5 hours per night so I am awake in the early hours of the mornings, but I now just work, so that is okay. Have fun girls, thinking of you. Big pink Hugs from New Zealand to all.

I did and now I am paying the price as I am exhausted and raging at the world and all the daily frustrations become huge mountains and major battles which I am determined to win. So life remains tough and sooo very frustrating. I often wish I had someone to help me with my battles. I am moving back into my house and have needed to open accounts with phone, power companies plus deal with local govt for a sickness benefit and yikes it is like I am trying to borrow millions of dollars. They want id, bonds, verifications, all have systems, procedures with no by passing. Ohhh  and I have a track record with all the companies. It is truly unbelievable and doing my head in again!!! Thankfully in NZ we are offered free counselling by the BC org so I am going before I get hold of a gun and shoot some of these fricking bureucrats!!! Just got of  the BC jail and I am not going back!! Thanks Tom for your kind words. One of my golfing mates whose daughter had cancer did advise me to be gentle with my mother, but even we, whom  I have a fantastic relationship as friends as well as mother daughter have had a couple of run ins. I know it is because we love each other and care but again my advice to partners, and all other relatives is DO NOT ASSUME CONTROL OF THE BC PERSONS LIFE. In my experience it is the one thing that I am fighting back for and I do rage if anyone tries to take it away from me for any reason known to mankind!!!! and there seem to be a lot of them LOL. Love Susie  I am being attacked by a blowfly at 3.45am!!!",

Just want to warn you about going mad!!!  I finally went to see a Counsellor as I thought I was loosing the plot as I was constantly losing my temper . She explained to me that I am in a stage of acute grief and that anger is part of the grief process and very normal. I finally quit work on the 30th Sept as I was exhausted, stressed to the max and basically no longer coping with life. Slowly on the up again. I had a pink party on the 10th Oct and Titch & I had a blast. We both ditched the wig !!! That took real courage from me but I think glasses of pink bubbles helped me!! Lots of photos to be posted on my Facebook soon so if you want to join me look for Suejane Brumby. We are so lucky in NZ as we have a very supportive health system, breast care set up and a caring government. My Dr put me on a sickness benefit for 6 months so I can get my act together again. I am setting up my own business in sleeping hats, turbans and kiddies hats for sick children as there is very little available in NZ. Our population is only 4 million !!! so we have to import a lot of products. I am going to have a lot of fun in this business and am going to Bali, India, Vietnam to source fabrics and ideas. I hope to do a world trip next year, and will come via the USA so it would be lovely for all of us to meet either  on or both the West Coast or East Coast!!! Lots of time to organise that but it would be so much fun. What do you all think? Take care chickies. Pink hugs to all Susie xx",

I have been given a drug for nausea and vomiting - DEXAMETHASONE (corticosteriod) and one of the side effects SE is trouble sleeping. I feel like a Jack in the Box wide awake after 3 hours sleep. It says to drop it after Day 3 and I will be very glad to do that. I have been given Melatonin capsules to sleep but they are not working yet GTmom do you have to have rads? I do.

A wee suggestion, if you have time go to your dentist or dental hygenist and ask them how to protect you teeth from demineralisation caused by chemo. Flouride gels and calcium & phosphate gels are available for you to use. My SE to date are lack of sleep, I feel totally energised but running on empty, a weird feeling, and facial flushing. No nausea due to great prescription drugs available. Fingers crossed for all. Hugs Susie",

A very traumatising experience. I took some of my girlfrieds to the hair dresser after work to get a No 1 buzz.  We had wine and nibbles and a lot of a laughs & photographed the event. Much easier to get it off instead of a slow loss stressful days.Take your wig with you and get your stylist to make sure it is properly cut for your face. Good luck and my thoughts are with you.
