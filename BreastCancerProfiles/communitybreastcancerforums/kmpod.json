I'm in the process of getting a copy of my path report from a stereotactic core biopsy (I forgot when I was at the surgeon's office yesterday.) I was told it was an \"average\" type of cancer for a 60 year old - I'm assuming IDC and she said there were some lobular characteristics. I'll catch up on the details soon. I've decided upon mastectomy without reconstruction, but I'm undecided whether to have uni or bi. Fifteen plus years ago I had an excisional biopsy of my left breast which showed cells with atypia. No problems have re-arisen yet in the left breast. The surgeon said there was no scientific reason to remove the left breast but it was up to me. Surgery is coming up in a week and a half so I'll have to decide in short order. Any comments with regards to pros or cons on the issue?  kathy Dx 7/15/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Having one \"good side\" should allow me to be more independent during recovery - a very important thing for me. I also feel that the decreased surgical and LE risk is a significant plus. When I called the Breast Care Centre and asked the nurse there about her experience with Ux and Bx patients, she related that one thing that has been mentioned to her several times is that with a Ux the remaining breast acts as an \"anchor\" to hold the bra and prosthetic in place when reaching up. With a Bx and prosthetics a reach over your head can leave you with your \"boobs\" hitched up very close to your chin. I would have never thought of that!",

It's very comfortable not to and I've sure never missed wearing a brassiere. What I find is that people really don't notice - and if they do, well, that doesn't matter. The fact that I'm 62 may have something to do with that. The biggest step is to be comfortable with yourself. If you aren't self-conscious about your \"condition\" then other people likely won't be conscious of it either. My personal reason for not having reconstruction is that I was unwilling to undergo any more than the essential medical procedures required to treat the cancer. Less surgery = less risk. I do have to say that my surgeon was very surprised about my refusal of reconstruction. She gave me any number of opportunities to change my mind. In the end, I think she learned that not reconstructing is a legitimate and healthy choice for some women. I think that she'll be less likely to dismiss it as an option with her future patients. I did not have nipple sparing surgery. I'm not sure if it's even an option with no reconstruction. Perhaps someone else can help you with that. All the best.",

On this particular forum are many women, like me, who have actively (and happily) foregone reconstruction and there are others who have had their reconstruction gone awry and had to deconstruct. Some of the threads are dauntingly long, but the stories are worth perusing when you're at this stage in the process.  As well, I'd hightly recommend breastfree.org/. It's a wonderful site that has been created by one of the forum members here. It helped me tremendously when I was researching what it would be like to live without breasts. Ultimately, it's a very personal decision; but do remember it is one that you don't have to make immediately. If, at this point, you decide against reconstruction you can change your mind at a later date and pursue reconstruction even years later. Above all, make sure that the decision that you make is yours and yours alone. Don't be pressured into doing something that you don't want to do by well-meaning professionals, friends and family. All my best wishes as you embark upon this journey.",

My lymphedema therapist is about a 1.5 hour drive each way and I was only getting MLD from her every two weeks. She also has a Lympha Press Optimal at her office.Though it's only set up to do one side at a time, it did give me a chance to try it out before making the purchase. After two weeks of daily usage both arms were down significantly and the sizing of my next pair of custom sleeves had to be adjusted down. And, though it can't be measured, I can tell that the balloons under my arms are diminishing. I find it very comfortable to use. The total cycle is an hour with part of that time being \"pretreatment\". I thought that I'd get antsy or bored using it and was planning to download podcasts to listen to while getting \"pumped\". I haven't had to do that. The sequential pumping almost puts me into a meditative state and the hour flies by. There are two downsides. With both sides being treated simultaneously, I need my husband to be around to zip me in, though I can get out myself if I leave one of the sleeves slightly unzipped. I think with practice and a few modifications,like adding extended zipper pulls, I'll get to the point of being able to do it all myself. The other consideration is that it really is very expensive (especially in Canadian $) and I have no insurance coverage for it. It can be used as a medical expense for tax purposes so that will help some. So\u2026 so far, so good. I think, for me, it will be a significant help in controlling this beast of a condition.

Good on you for poking at the system. Anger, when funnelled productively, can be very effective. I'm also very sensitive to medical adhesives. Tegaderm is the absolute worst. This thread:https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/... is very lengthy but contains a lot of useful information. My surgery was almost 4 years ago now and I don't recall which tape I ended up being able to use, but I followed up on some advice on the thread and obtained several samples of tapes that were reputed to be less likely to provoke reactions. (You may have to get your pharmacy to order them for you.) I pretested them on my forearm prior to surgery and supplied my own tape to be used post-surgically to minimize the issues. My surgeon had no issues with that. It's very likely that a lot of new information has arisen on the thread since I last visited it, so it would be worth perusing. As well, it seems that people who have sensitivities to medical adhesives can be more likely to have a latex allergy. I was sent for allergy testing prior to a subsequent surgery and, in my case, the results were negative - but, again, it's another thing worth considering. ",

I've found a number of things, used in combination, keep the pain down to a dull roar; and, though my mobility is still limited, it's enough to allow me to remain on the medication. I supplement with Omega 3's, Magnesium, and a natural joint pain remedy called 7 Joint Complex by Sisu, which contains boswellia among other things. I take Claritin daily. I find it essential to controlling my bone pain. If I don't take it the pain keeps me awake through the night. I have acupuncture every 2 weeks. I do Tai Chi, sometimes using knee support. I wear Birkenstock sandals, even when in the house. Sometimes I'll use walking poles when I'm out for a walk. Each of these items seems to play a role in pain control. I've found that I really can't leave out even one part of the puzzle or my mobility begins to suffer. Unfortunately I'm unable to use NSAID's.

I chose to do a unilateral to ease and speed the healing process, I have a very independent personality and felt that I'd need less assistance if I had one \"good\" side. That has worked out to be true; and my healing has gone very well. I really feel it made life easier for both DH and me. Now, though, after reading my final path report, I realize that I really do want to go ahead with the second mastectomy. If I'd known before surgery what I know now about my pathology I would have gone ahead and done the bilateral on the first go regardless of a tougher recovery. But, you can only make decisions based on the information you have at the time, so I'm not beating myself up about it.  Good luck with your decision. What my surgeon said is true. You can't undo a mastectomy if you change your mind later; but, you can always change your mind and do the second one later. ",

There was also a small focus of DCIS in another location. To further quote the path report: There was extensive proliferative breast disease including adenosis, duct hyperpasia including focus of ADH, micropapillary hyperplasia, columnar cell changes, apocrine hyperplasia and cystic change. That was one very busy breast, eh? I was really relieved that I chosen mastectomy over lumpectomy with rads after reading that. I've had difficulty believing that breast disease of that extent would present in only one breast - especially since my left breast already had shown some changes in the past. I had an excisional biopsy in that breast almost 16 years ago. At that time the changes were benign but I'm just not comfortable waiting for that to change.  My surgeon has agreed to do the second mastectomy and I'm hoping to be able to schedule it for October.     ",

These two weeks were booked for our holidays before all this BC stuff happened and I'd like my DH not to totally miss out on a summer vacation. He's been just great. But that means I'm going to have to wait now until we drive down to see the surgeon next Wednesday. Ack, again! The only time of year that's worse than this for delays is Christmas. Lilylady - I'll be thinking of you on Monday. Best of luck and a speedy recovery. Remember the Senokot!",

It's interesting to me how much of a presumption there is regarding post-surgical reconstruction. I'd prefer the surgeon tuck up the fat flaps that will be left (I'm no sylph) but she says if I still feel the same way regarding reconstruction in a year or two a plastic surgeon can remove them.  Have they been a significant issue or bother for people here? or am I needlessly concerned? Has anyone been bothered to the point that they sought surgery to flatten the fat flaps at a later date? By the way do the residual fat rolls equal dog ears? ",

It did seem to me, during my consultation with her, that my decision is so far out of the norm that, as firebird put so well, she didn't internalize the information. Is it really so unusual to take this path? It just seems to me to be a sensible alternative given what I know about my cancer. By the way, I live in a rural area of Southern Ontario and I will be travelling to a hospital that is an hour and a half from home. The surgery will be performed as day surgery and I'll be staying in town the night prior to and the night of the surgery. (That's how they do it here in Ontario - even a bilateral would have been day surgery.)The hospital is not in a major urban area but comes highly recommended and, thus far, I've been very happy with the care I've received.  Everyone I have dealt with has been very professional and yet very empathetic.  After the path report is received in 2-3 weeks I will be referred to a cancer care centre in a larger urban area that is somewhat closer to home - the Juravinsky in Hamilton.  Wish me luck! ",

Everyone here has been so helpful and reassuring. I'm astonished at how little pain I'm experiencing. I'm down to one Tylenol 3 every 6-8 hours and I'll likely be able to discontinue that today. The main discomfort, as everyone predicted is the drain - but even that is better now that the VON changed the position of the tape that was tugging under my axilla. The nurse told me that I'll be experiencing less discomfort than usual because the surgeon didn't make a separate incision to take the sentinel nodes, she just extended the breast incision, so it's a very tidy job. I've started doing a few of the suggested exercises and I had a short walk last night with DH. He's somewhat disconcerted that I'm as well as I am - he's two naps ahead of me! My sleeping isn't too bad, considering. It's just that I usually sleep on my right side or my belly, so sleeping on my back  doesn't feel natural. I ended up moving to the sofa last night because of better back support and also, because the sofa back held my \"arm\" pillows more securely in position. Very important - don't forget your Senokot-S. I started a couple of days prior to the surgery and It's worked like a charm.   ",

However, once I got my post-surgical path report and realized that my right breast was a cancer hatchery par excellence I made the decision to have a prophylactic left mastectomy. As it turned out it was wise I did. There were several foci of precancerous cells lurking in there. My surgeon confirmed that I had made the right decision. My mastectomies were separated by 3 months and, other than persistently stubborn seromas, I had no complications. I should add, though, that reconstruction was never under consideration and that greatly simplified my decision making process.",

It's much less common than IDC. From what I have read they are very different animals, biologically. ILC can be more difficult to detect because it's more diffuse and doesn't form lumps. It causes more of a thickening- which is a good description of mine. I didn't feel it, the nurse at the breast care clinic didn't feel it and it took my surgeon a while to find it, even with having my mammogram to refer to. If you go to \"Symptoms and Diagnosis\" at the top of the page you'll find a very good description of how they differ.  I really wish that I had the information prior to surgery that I do now. I would have gone for a double right off the bat, even if the recovery period was significantly more difficult than I'm having with the unilateral. I'm not beating myself up, though. The surgery came up three weeks sooner than originally planned (the surgeon had a cancellation) and so my research time was curtailed. (I was also a bit of a basket case, truth be told.) I did broach the subject of a bilateral with my surgeon prior to my surgery and she said that I could have it at a later time if I so decided. I just haven't taken very long to decide that that's what I want - provided my assumption about my diagnosis is correct. That, I hope to know tomorrow. ",

I've been educating myself here (thank you breastcancer.org) and as I've researched I've come to the conclusion that my left breast should be \"offed\" too. With a higher chance of mirroring than IDC (I've read anywhere from 15-30% chance of contralateral occurence) and lower success in detection with mammogram it makes sense to me. Particularly since the architecture of my left breast has been disturbed by a lumpectomy I had in that breast 16 years ago. How long would I have to wait to have the second mastectomy? I suppose that is somewhat dependant on any further treatment? I'm starting to stew again about the path and what's ahead. I decided that I would just enjoy the sense of having made a positive step with the surgery and take as much of a holiday from anxiety as I could, for as long as I could.

I didn't want anything to pull or push on the drain, which I had in just short of three weeks.(Actually, even at that, I think the drain got pulled a bit too soon. I've been back for one aspiration and expect I'll go again next week for another.) My wound was dry and healing so well that at about the four day mark I removed the dressing and had just the steristrips open to the air under the same soft shirts. I wore a fanny pack to hold the hemo-vac and the excess tubing. I learned to keep the tubing covered because it was all to easy to snag it on a door knob. Ouch! Lesson learned.  I was able to shower 48 hours after the surgery. I tied a cord around my neck and pinned the hemo-vac onto it. I had DH use surgical tape to tape a zip lock bag over the dressing to keep out the water while I was showering, but after 4 days I didn't bother with that. Since I've had the drain out the most comfortable thing to wear has been a stretchy cami that has a shelf bra. In fact, I've been wearing it night and day. It seems to have just enough compression to keep some fluid at bay and there's some support for the remaining breast. As well, it comes up high enough under the arm not to irritate the SNB site. May your drains be banished soon. ",
