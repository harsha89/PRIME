      "Content": "Apr 5, 2018 06:51PM - edited Apr 5, 2018 06:54PM by Irene1524 Just had 18/33 today. My RO thinks my skin is not red enough, so she is adding a Bolus to my treatment tomorrow. I see what she means \u2014 my skin is just a little bit darker and it doesn't hurt or itch or anything. It's just a bit sore. And I understand that this is necessary to catch stray cancer cells, but now I am afraid of rads all over again. Obviously, with my skin not getting a big enough dose, I have no idea what this really feels like yet, even though I am so far in. I am about to find out. And what if she decides to add to my schedule? Has anyone had this happen to them? Did they have to have additional treatments? How bad did the Bolus make things? But I asked my RO a question today that i've been thinking about for a while and I thought i'd give the answer here, in case anyone else is wondering. My last 6 treatments will be boosts to the area where my primary tumor was. So I wanted to know why I am not getting a boost on the spot where my nodal tumor was? My lymph node had a tumor half a centimeter in size. Not just micromets. She said it's because that area of the body can't take this much radiation without injury to nerves and other important structures that could paralyze the arm. Also, recurrences apparently occur where the primary tumor was first and can spread from there, but they will not start in the lymph nodes. And here is another question. I asked if the radiation was affecting my gastrointestinal tract, because I feel mildly nauseated after each treatment, for about an hour or so. My RO said the radiation beam is tightly targeted and does not hit anything else. Not my stomach, or liver, or pancreas, or anything else below my chest. But if that is so, why does everyone have to get out of the room before my treatment begins? I had no chemo, so it's not that. Does anyone else have nausea? My upper chest is getting rads, too, all the way to the clavicle and even a bit higher than that, plus breast and underarm. I think that is called Level 1,2, and 3. Could this be a thyroid issue?",

The doctor said that the bolus acts as an extra layer of skin and that this tricks the beam into not going quite as deeply, but hitting the shallower areas more. Not sure I understand what she means, but I just had 21/33 today, and the skin under my arm definitely looks redder. The bolus does not seem to have affected the rest of me yet, though i\u2019m sure it\u2019s about to get worse, as that one spot under the arm appears to act as the canary in the mine",

So glad to be done with the large area treatments cause the skin under my arm is very dark red, peeling, itchy, and uncomfortable. Today the doctor handed me a couple of packets of Domeboro to treat this problem area. I am wearing a cotton cami UNDER my bra, and it really helps to keep the irritation at bay. I\u2019ve pulled the cami up on one side to cover the peeling areas nicely so they don\u2019t rub against my arm. The bra keeps the cami in place in this position. Nice little tip I picked up from someone\u2019s comment on these boards \u2014 either the March or April group. Whoever you are, thank you for this idea. It\u2019s been really helpful now that my skin is falling apart!",
