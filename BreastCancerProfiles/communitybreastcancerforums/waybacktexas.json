After that I will have to seek other coverage because I will be too old. If it does turn out to be cancer it would be considered a pre-existing condition. I could never afford the treatments on my own and I would not want my family to feel obligated to help me with the high costs. I think I will wait to see a dr and keep an eye on it for now.

Its got a bruised color and its painless It also has a bumpy surface with one part of it seeming harder than the rest. I've had it for over 3 weeks and it has not shrunk but grown a little. It seems firmly fixed in one spot. Should I be concerned? I don't have a family history of breast cancer but I am overweight. I am only 25. Should I go see a doctor? Log in to post a reply",
