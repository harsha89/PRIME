My HER2 is negative and my Estrogen and Progesterone are both positive. The measurement of the spot was .6cm x.6cm x.7cm. I was doing ok after my biopsy and even yesterday after my results but woke up this morning nauseous and vomiting. I got the results from the Radiologist and I don\u2019t see the surgeon until 11/9. Does anyone know what this means?",
