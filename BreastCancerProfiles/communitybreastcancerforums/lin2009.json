I was too stunned to ask what I can expect him to do next week; just check me over or actually do a biopsy? I will need to call his office tomorrow and get more information. I was surprised that they are sending me to the surgeon so soon without asking for a mammogram or a ultrasound. What would be the reason for that? In my mind, it means the worst; that a cancer is probable. Am I overreacting? I found this site and everyone is so warm and conforting that I felt right at home here already. Can anyone tell me the most important questions to ask when I see the surgeon. I know nothing about even where to start. Thanks lin2009",
