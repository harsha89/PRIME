I was wondering if anyone out there would like to inherit my Amoena Post Surgical Camisole (size small) with zip up front, pockets for 2 drains and puffy forms? I only used it for a couple of weeks at the most. It's in great condition. I will mail it to you. PM me if you are interested. Best of luck to you all. You can get through this.  Here's a link to the product:  http://www.amoena.us/Products/Recovery-Care/Recovery-Garments/Hannah-Camisole-2860/Hannah-2860-white",

I am having an BMX in 2 weeks and gathered the strength and courage to decline recon after I found your site. The stories are moving and very positive. I look forward to loving and accepting my new flat chest next month. Thank you again ! ",

      "Content": "bamboogirl wrote: I'm having a BMX on Tuesday with no lymph node surgery and no recon. I've been cruising the discussion groups and it seems like the pain scale out of surgery is all over the map depending on what type of procedure people have. Anyone with a total mastectomy and no recon can tell me really how much pain I could expect to be in and how quickly they recovered? I don't like prescription drugs of any kind but will take pain meds if I have to. I had a lumpectomy 3 years ago and didn't need pain meds for that. Any insight would be greatly appreciated and help me mentally prepare. All the best... Log in to post a reply",
