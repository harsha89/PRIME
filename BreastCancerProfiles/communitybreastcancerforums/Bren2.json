Therefore i opted for lumpectomy, but results after surgery indicated one sentinal node was large for cancer(7mm) and positive for lymphovascular invasion..I too would have opted for mastectomy had I known all this before.  But, the biggest worry now is controlling the cancer from travelling so I am currently in chemo, then radiation..I was also highly considering bilateral mastectomy after..what do you think?  I just dont know if I could deal with waiting for the recurrance. thanks for listening.",
