I received my 5th of 6 doses of Chemo yesterday when I experienced an adverse reaction from the Carboplatin. I am on 3 meds of Chemo- Herceptin, Taxitere and Carboplatin. I receive those in that order for a total of 3 1/2 hours every 3rd Tuesday. The day after, I receive the shot in the arm for the White Blood Cell which made me feel achy in my legs for the remainder of the month. They said it would be flu like symptoms (fatigue/body aches) and I can't tell which makes me feel more (weird), the chemo or the shot in the arm.The other Tuesdays in between I receive the Herceptin for 1/2 an hour.Radiation treatment will begin early August this year-15 mins a day/5 days a week for 6 weeks. They say it only takes about 1-2 mins of radiation, the rest of the time is talking and getting ready for it. The other problems I've had throughout this journey is: my body was rejecting the port and a blood clot formed in my left elbow area-stayed a night in the hospital, had Lova (something named that) injections in my stomach for 6 days straight, bruised but it wasn't too bad. Had some anxiety attacks, broke out with terrible itching all over at various times, restless legs, swelling in both feet and ankles (the onset of the adverse reaction) that started this past Friday morning. Thank you all for listening.....it really feels great to know we can share our experiences and not feel alone :)  Blessings to all........
