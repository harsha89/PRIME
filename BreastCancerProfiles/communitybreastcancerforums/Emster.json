It really helps, as you all know.  Karen-  Is that taxotere and carboplatin that you got or will get 4 times? I am not sure I did the oncotype but will be sure to ask next week. Maybe mine is due to being HER2+. I just don't know enough. I didn't think I would need chemo either in the beginning. Feel great, healed really nice from mx so will not start chemo probably til end of Sept or early Oct. Have you started already? Cowgirl- Soo happy you are done and that it wasn't that bad for you. That must be such a relief. It seems like it will be the longest couple months ever.  Yes, I will look into the port. A year with that seems so lone. I am glad you were node negative too. I am going to try the Penguin Cold cap thing to try and save my hair if I can. Did any of you guys do the pet scan thing?  Thanks for everything. God has sent me a strong sense of peace with whatever will come next. Just want to be around for a long time! Emmy ",

Similar to yours, wide DCIS with IDC, stage 1, grade 3, hormone neg, HER2+, no nodes.  Just had a bilateral mastectomy week and half ago.  I  am curious about our treatment because my onc told me that I can just also choose the TC )taxotere & carboplatin but also with Herceptin due to HER2+ but she said guidelines indicate 6 cycles, not 4. I am confused about the number of cycles. I pray that you have made the right decision. Hope all goes well with you.",
