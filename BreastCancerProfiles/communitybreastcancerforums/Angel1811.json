I found a breast lump 4 months ago and went to the doctors, she referred me to the breast clinic where I had a mammogram and scan and the consultant thought it was an oil cyst and he said there was some calcification. Also I had an indent in my breast that they think is caused by the huge amount of weight loss I have had. I have been dieting. They gave me an appointment for another scan which they said I may or may not have a biopsy at. That appointment was today. She said the lump hasn't grown and she felt it was an oil cyst but wanted to perform a biopsy to be safe so now I have a horrible 6 day wait for results and I'm terrified because I read that cancer causes indents and also I'm a type 2 diabetic and I have read that increases my risk. I'm 44 years old. Please someone talk to me xx Log in to post a reply",
