My husband gets upset with me that I do but he doesn't understand that if I am going to live with this disease and fight it, I need to find out all I can about it. Knowledge is power.  If I had been better educated 2 years ago, I would not have believed my doctor when he told that since my mammogram was all clear as well as the ultrasound that there was NOTHING to worry about. The way I see it, you have one chance at this.  You better have a good game plan!",

I received my first shots last month and a lil less than a month later took bloodwork and met with my Onc.  When i was in \"remission\" my makers were at 300 and had since shot up to 900.  so...................... less than a month into this new combo I was thrilled to hear him say that they went from 900 to 500! It was well worth the pain and side effects in my opinion and if I can manage those next time it will be even better.  I couldn't have asked for a better Christmas present this year.  This means more time with my 9 yr old and that means the world to me, pain or not! Merry christmas to all my Stage IV sisters, may your Christmas presents be as amazing as mine!  You are all in my prayers!

So far all imaging results have been \"inconclusive\" as to what IS causing the damage.  I get the biopsy result on Monday I went to pick up my Xray results yerterday and here is what the report says... ONLY 50% OF THE ANTERIOR ASPECT OF THE ACETABULUM COVERS THE FEMORAL HEAD. THERE IS ALSO A LYTIC LESION INVOLVING THE LEFT FEMORAL NECK MEASURING 4 X 3 CM. MOST OF THE FEMORAL NECK IS DESTROYED EXCEPT FOR THE MEDIAL CORTEX. THE PATIENT IS LIKELY AT RISK FOR PATHOLOGIC FRACTURE. Note: My Onc called an Ortho Surgeon when he got this result so I would be seen urgently, the ortho surgeon did not see any cause for alarm and said I could wait till next week. To be honest, I am scared to walk around or use the stairs in my house. And they STILL dont know what is eating away at my bones, let's hope Monday brings answers.

I do not cry in the shower, matter of fact the hot water makes me all happy... weird isnt it?  But the other day I was on my way to an apt and there was a good song on and I cranked it and was bopping and dancing and suddenly I was bawling like a toddler who had their lollipop stolen.  I had to be late for my apt so my tears would dry and my nose would not be red!  HAHA I do always feel a lot better after a good cry but...  it's hard to explain to my husband. For example.. the other he teased me about my age.  My husband and I have always teased each other about a ton of stuff.  Well this time it was as if he told me the worse possible thing in the world and I just crumbled and cried. When I think of it now I think its silly.  So maybe I will get my Pristique adjusted. Thank you ladies!",

I don't know if it's medicine related...  I take Tamoxiden...  But I am on an anti-depressant... I dont even cry because I just cry... maybe I'm going crazy. Does anyone else experience this?
