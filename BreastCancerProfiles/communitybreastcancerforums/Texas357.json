I finished Taxotere on April 7th, had my tear ducts opened once in the opthalmologist's office, and when that didnt' work had surgery in early June.",

So when my surgeon said that one breast was healthy, I felt I'd dodged a bullet by not needing a double. Fast forward 11 months: I just had a prophylactic mastectomy and couldn't be happier about it. My reasons: 1. My body image has changed. I'm thrilled to be alive,and getting my hair back. And I'm anxious to see now my new \"perky\" breasts will look! 2. I had invasive lobular carcinoma, and multifocal spots of cancer, which increased my chances of it showing up on the other side. 3. To help prevent lymphedema, after you have lymph nodes removed the experts say you need to restrict your use of that arm to some extent. I wasn't willing to risk getting cancer on the other side (right) because I'm right handed and want full use of that arm. 4. I compared a few weeks of recovery from the mastectomy to 9 months of chemo and radiation. 5. I didn't want to spend a lifetime holding my breath for every mammogram result, and always wondering if they missed something. I had 13 mammograms in a row before they found my cancer, and by then it was already invasive. I didn't want to take that kind of risk again.   6. The doctors are quick to prescribe Aromatase Inhibitors vs. Tamoxifen, saying they are far superior, when in fact there's just a 2% absolute difference between their effectiveness. My doctor said, \"That 2 percent is huge to the two women who develop cancer because they were on one drug vs.another.\" But when he told me my chance of developing cancer on the other side was small, he didn't think that was a big deal. He wouldn't even quantify it. Either small percentages such as 2% are important or their not. In my case, the path report showed atypical lobular hyperplasia which had turned into the cancer I'd had on the other side. Now that same doctor has admitted that I did the right thing.",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2010 10:01AM - edited Apr 17, 2010 10:02AM by Texas357 As others have said, this is a very personal decision. As far as the odds, the mastectomy will dramatically lower your chance of recurrence in the breasts but that's not to say that your chances aren't already quite low. What you'll discover when reading the statistics is that most will use relative risk instead of absolute risk. For example, if your actual chances of getting hit by an out of control bus are 50%, they might say moving to the side of the road lowers your risk by 50% -- when in fact your absolute risk is 25%. That said, I want to share my reasons for having a BMX. I only had a single mastectomy first. Then I went through 6 months of chemo and 33 rounds of radiation. It was a time-intensive experience and not one that I'd be anxious to repeat. When I talked with my oncologist about what would happen if the cancer showed up in the other breast, he said that he'd just hit it with more chemo. #1: I didn't want more chemo. The second reason is that I didn't want to keep worrying and wondering. I'd had 12 years of mammograms that were completely clear, then I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer that had invaded 7 of 13 lymph nodes. #2: I really didn't trust diagnostics to keep me safe. The third reason is that I developed a mild case of lymphedema in my arm on the surgical side. Whenever they take lymph nodes, you have to be cautious about what you do for the rest of your life because the possibility of lymphedema is always lurking after chest surgery. I didn't want to lose full use of my right (dominant) arm. #3: Substantially lowers the risk of ever getting lymphedema in my other arm. So about 9 months after my initial mastectomy, I returned for a prophylactic mastectomy and I've never regretted it. For one thing, the tissue of the \"good breast\" that looked perfectly clear in the MRI 9 months before was filled with atypical lobular hyperlasia (ALH) meaning that I would have need closer monitoring for the rest of my life. Also, I had no problems with my insurance covering the prophylactic mastectomy. Good luck with your decision. I hope that you find peace whatever you decide.",

But you are no doubt reducing that risk. Here's my thinking: once you have an SNB etc. done, you have a lifetime risk of developing lymphedema on that side. Any LE therapist will warn you to ALWAYS and forever limit certain activities. When I developed mild LE on the cancer side (left), I immediately thought: I'm right handed. If I ever develop cancer on the right side and they do an SNB, then I'll always be limited in my use of my dominant arm. That risk was unacceptable to me.  I had other reasons for wanting the proph. surgery, but this was among my main reasons. My breast surgeon assured me that he would not do an SNB for a prophylactic mastectomy, so I went forward with the surgery. In my case, I felt like I dodged a bullet because where there had been no evidence of disease a few months earlier, the path report on my right side after the mastectomy revealed atypical lobular hyperplasia. I believe it was just a matter of time before I would have needed the 2nd mastectomy and it would have involved an SNB too.",

I do not have any trained LE specialists within 50 miles of me -- I've checked all the resources. So I'm on my own. After doing a lot of reading, I discovered that one of my compression sleeves was the right compression (20-30 HHmg) but too short. It came to just above my elbow. The other sleeve was the right length but 10-20 HHmg. It bunched up all over and/or slid down because it was too loose. So I just got a new sleeve that's the right length and right compression. I put it on and it immediately started making my arm ache. Is that normal? I'm hoping to finally see some progress! My left affected arm is 1/4 inch bigger than my dominant, unaffected right arm.

I do lots of research so that I'm ready with questions and to know that I've made the best possible decisions. On a more personal note, when I was diagnosed, I told everyone that I no longer had time for crabby people. If someone chooses to be petty or selfish, then I tell them it's not helpful to me and they are welcome to spend time around me when they are in a more positive frame of mind. That has helped immensely! I feel more in control and stronger -- choosing to be around positive people who help me to stay positive. Lastly, I try to get as much exercise as possible -- at least 30 minutes a day for \"me\". I find that exercising and eating right makes me feel better about myself. Accept that you will have days when everything feels like it's caving in on you. But those days don't have to dominate your life. Don't forget to laugh and find little things that make you smile every day. We laughed in the chemo room .. I was cracking jokes with the nurses and my doctor before my mastectomy. I spend time doing things that I'm passionate about, and I choose to spend time around the people who bring  me the most pleasure.   Despite the diagnosis, or maybe because of it, now is the time to create the life you deserve to live.",

Then I got an infection on the rads side, surgery to clean that out, followed by a massive hematoma that never would heal. So last week I started a complete reconstruction do-over on the rads side with an LD Flap and tissue expander. My arm, which had been super good for months, is very swollen and sore. Oh boy. I have a tip that may help those of you with bone troubles. I'd battled osteopenia for about 5 years prior to BC because of a benign parathyroid tumor. I had a bone scan just prior to chemo, then again a few months after finishing. Despite chemo, and being basically immobile for months, my hip bones actually gained density. The only thing I can attribute it to is the Strontium Citrate that I have been taking in addition to calcium/Vitamin D supplements. You have to take the Strontium four hours in between any calcium intake. I was very pleased. My spine measurements had remained stable. Do a search for Strontium renalate research in Europe. That's a patented formula not available in the states, so strontium citrate is the closest we can get as far as a delivery method. I had another bone density test done about a month ago but haven't been back to the doctor to get the results yet. I'm using Femara which also does a number on bones, so I'm trying to keep close tabs on things.",

As for recovery, I'm doing great. I'm back in a regular bra today, started sleeping with my regular pillow two nights ago, and I'm off pain killers. My PS told me to take it easy and reminded me that I'm only a week out of surgery -- I've got so much energy that I want to get back to the way things were. I'm still a little sore but the bruising is almost gone. So anyone yet to go through this, there IS hope for a relatively easy recovery even with expanders!",

Parathyroid tumors cause osteopenia but according to my surgeon (who is one of the leading experts on them), the condition is 100% reversible after the tumor is removed. He said all I needed was Calcium, Vitamin D and exercise. I did lots of weight-bearing exercise, took my supplements as directed, but my bones never fully recovered. Now I know why! I stumbled on a WebMD BC site, which said BC cells can actually increase the activity of bone degeneration. I don't understand how it works, but since my cancer was very slow growing -- everything now makes sense. Now that I'm killing the BC, maybe my bones will actually recover (as long as I steer clear of Aromatase Inhibitors that is).",

But the prank involves sending people a picture of me without my wig. So I still need to muster the courage. Here's the scheme: everyone's asking me if my hair is coming in different than it was before. Plus, I've been inundated with pink ribbon stuff. So I want to tell people that I'm quite alarmed because my hair is coming in a very unusual color, and that I think it has something to do with being around so much pink stuff. Then I'll attach a picture of me with my hair dyed a bright neon pink. Making others laugh at my expense might just make me brave enough to do it. What do you think?",

The exception is that we had a trip to Rome all planned last year when I was diagnosed. My husband wants to do it in 2010. Every time I think of Rome, I think of BC.

Eating is a miserable experience. My fingernails and toenails throb all day and night. My hands are virtually useless for a lot of things. Imagine everything you might avoid if you had wet fingernail polish: that's what I have to avoid because of the nail pain. The nail beds are darkening, which means on top of everything else I'll probably lose the nails entirely. Thankfully the pads of my fingers, though numb, are useable.

The eye doctor is part of a group that has several offices, and the medical records office is downtown but my chart is at an office closer to where I live. Somehow I wasn't surprised when they told me they can't fax my records unless they have my chart downtown so I'm just going to have to wait until someone can transport it. This is an eye surgeon who, among other things, required me to find another doctor to order the chest x-ray and EKG for the surgery HE was doing; never came to see me before the surgery or talk to my husband afterward, and FORGOT to get insurance authorization so he can remove the friggen stints. Meanwhile, he's trying to strong arm me into another surgery that only he does. When there's ice in the center of the earth maybe.  But in the meantime, they are throwing a major roadblock into my getting help elsewhere.

I get tattoos in a week, if the healing is finished from nipple surgery. Still not completely happy with the reconstruction but I'll wait until fall for any further surgeries. My company just started offering Aflac insurance, and they have a cancer policy. If I'd had this before, I would have been paid at least $9000 since diagnosis! Wondering if I should get a policy ($20/month) just in case or if I'm tempting fate. Still have lasting effects from the chemo, including almost nonexistent brows and lashes, but I'm thrilled to have my stamina and tastebuds back! ",

Either way, because she doesn't want to risk introducing infection or rejection, she will NOT do anything about it even though it's painful and it distorts the shape of the new breast. So I've got the prophy side that's got loose ripples that can't be fixed, and I'm lumpy on the other side.

I'm 51. It's just my husband and me, 3 golden retrievers, a shih tzu and our foster golden. (We volunteer for a golden rescue group.) I'm working full time while in treatment which is easier for me because I work from home. But it still requires putting in a full day at the computer. I've got my wigs (two exactly the same), a sleep cap, and I kept two hair net thingees from the hospital when I had my port installed so that I can catch my hair as it falls out. My step-daughter is knitting me a pink throw for chemo days. I'll have my DVD player and my husband. Nice combination! I'm scared but hoping for the best. I sure want this to be a one-time thing! For my 50th birthday, I had a hysterectomy due to a uterine fibroid. For my 51st birthday, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I plan to throw a huge party for my 52nd birthday next July because by that point I hope to be putting the finishing touches on my reconstruction!   I'm calling my support group Team Happy Hour. I send out a group email whenever I have updates, and I've got a stack of cards and gifts that tell me I've got a whole bunch of people fighting with me in spirit. Pleased to \"meet\" all of you!",

Here's my dilemma: I like the guy BUT he doesn't seem too serious about being my partner in planning my future. I've tried to have a serious discussion with him about AI side effects and a prophylactic mastectomy: each time, he says I worry too much and to stop paying attention to the studies and statistics. I asked if he was going to monitor my estrogen levels (\"no\"); take baseline cholesterol levels because AIs are known to raise cholesterol (\"no\").    I called him a week ago for help about the water weight gain, and he said he wasn't concerned. Well, a few days later it settled into my surgical arm and I now have lymphedema. Who knows if a prescription diuretic would have helped but from what I've read, there is no cure for lymphedema once you get it. You just have to learn to manage it for the rest of your life. Today, my radiation oncologist said I should call my medical oncologist about the dry cough I've had for a couple of weeks because it could indicate heart damage due to chemo. When I called, he referred me to my general practitioner because he thought I just needed a prescription-strength cough syrup. I'm feeling like he's not taking the potential side effects seriously. Or am I perhaps becoming way too focused on the \"what ifs\"????",

I had my blood tested before using the 'loading amount' which was daily for 2 weeks, then going to the recommended twice weekly. My estrogen levels actually fell during that period. My gynecologist read everything he could on it, and feels it's safe to use. The other recommendation is frequency, even though it hurts.

That sounds like such a \"head in the sand\" philosophy. I did pay to have my cholesterol tested last fall, and it went up 20 points in one year thanks to Femara. I like the idea of adding an integrative MD to the mix.  I live about 50 miles from one of the best medical centers in the country, including MD Anderson Cancer Center. Most of the oncologists around me have trained down there, then started their own practices.  Including the one I'm now using. But he hasn't kept up with the times. MD Anderson has a thriving integrative oncology area. The problem is that they tell YOU when to show up for an appointment,and you are assigned to a doctor. Typically, appointments run 4-5 hours late! That, combined with the distance, is just very stressful to me. I went there to consult with an opthalmologist about my tear ducts. I was ready to scream by the time we left nearly 6 hours after my scheduled appointment!  And that one appointment was charged to my insurance company at more than $5,000!",

But the news is unsettling because I have a list of permanent side effects, including tear ducts permanently scarred shut from taxotere. For 10 years, I've told myself that the side effects were worth the benefits. On top of all that ... the doctor said unlike IDC, ILC is more likely to recur years later.

When we are diagnosed with breast cancer, our emotional ability to absorb all of this without feeling overwhelmed differs from one person to the next. If you try to give a woman all of the information she needs up front, it might send her over the edge. I know it would have for me. I had to read and absorb it in small increments.  What do people absolutely need to know? I guess my answer would be that everyone should start educating themselves now about more than mammographies.Because chances are good that someday soon, they or someone they know will be diagnosed with breast cancer and knowledge is power. Start gaining that knowledge now. When the diagnosis comes, you might be too distraught. ",

I have been making some pretty silly word mistakes lately, forgetting things, etc. I'm entering week #3 after my last FEC and just starting to feel normal. I got my copy of Awakening the Warrior Goddess last night and stayed up late reading most of it. What I like about it is that she's not pushing an \"all or nothing\" approach. She gives several alternatives, all of which can add up to helping to prevent a recurrence. I have 12 chemo treatments in all, and the time is beginning to drag. The end isn't anywhere near in sight. So I've decided to focus on the dietary and lifestyle changes I can make right now to help make sure this is the last time I have to deal with this disease. Hopefully by the time I finish chemo, some of them will have become good habits.

Some other suggestions that seem to follow across the board include eating more cruciferous vegetables like brocolli and cauliflower, grinding 3 tbps of flax seeds and using them in your food daily, and using organic foods whenever possible to avoid the chemicals added that have been shown to raise estrogen levels in the body. There are also apparently some nutritional supplements such as Ginseng and CoQ10 that supposedly enhance the effect of chemo. But not having seen the actual studies, I don't know how true those statements are. I found a 2nd book by a cancer survivor and medical doctor called Anticancer: A New Way of Life. I haven't ordered it yet, but looking at the pages on Amazon, he appears to have come to most of the same conclusions as the Awakening the Warrior Goddess medical doctor. My oncologist does not believe that dietary changes make a difference, but I certainly believe that what we put into our bodies may have an impact, and I want to lower my chance of recurrence as much as possible! No way do I want to go through all this again!!!",

I've worked full time since my diagnosis, although I've taken quite a few vacation days since chemo started. If I couldn't hold my eyes open, I certainly couldn't function at work!

Heck, I'll toast to that! He also said the biggest problem for women with BC is depression.

This year, we adopted our foster dog (coincidentally named Cinda). How unusual is that? I had a nice but exhausting visit with my family over Christmas (they stayed with us). My throat is sore, and I think I might be coming down with a cold. One last FEC next Tuesday and Wednesday. I'm still not fully recovered from the 2nd one. I wish I could say I'm feeling positive but I'm almost in tears just thinking about how I'll feel. Hopefully the weekly treatments will be much easier on this old bod!  ",

I still haven't recovered completely from TX #2 of FEC, although my taste buds are back to normal so I do plan to open a bottle of bubbly tonight. I'm starting 2009 out as positively as possible!   My last FEC treatment is next week, then I start 9 weekly treatments of Taxotere. I don't mind saying that I'm almost in tears at the thought of another FEC treatment because I was so miserable the last time. I'm so grateful that my husband goes with me to provide moral support! Our good friends gave us a juicer. I plan to try out several recipes this weekend, and then put my husband in charge of the machine next week when I'll need that juice the most. I'm not a water drinker so that part of chemo has been a challenge. 2008 was a tough year but it was also filled with blessings. I discovered just how many angels I have in my life who are there to support me and hold me up when I'm not feeling very brave. We WILL get past this ladies!!!!   ",

My sister is 60 and still has a happy sex life without taking hormone replacements.   Looks like I'll be in a wait and see mode until I the effects of chemo are out of my system.

Judging from the way my insurance company has been acting, I might have wound up paying 1/2 the surgical bills which I could not afford. I go for Taxotere treatment #6 today (chemo #9 so far).

Mandy, they leave their pawprints on our hearts. As much as it hurts, we wouldn't want it any other way. Look at it this way: your Golden also made your heart that much bigger. Caroline, I know what you mean about the Relay for Life. I was diagnosed in October (Breast Cancer Awareness Month) and I got pretty sick of it being in my face. Now I also want to stay connected but I don't want this to dominate my life as it has for the last year. I was VERY happy and content before my diagnosis, and while I feel stronger and more greatful for every minute now, I am also anxious to reclaim my life. I know my husband, who has been with me every second of this journey, is also ready to move on. I am doing everything I can to prevent a recurrence while at the same time not letting it dominate my life. I already ate well and exercised. Now I'm being more diligent about it. The only big change is that I just cleared my drawers of all cosmetics and lotions made with parabens and phylalates (not sure of the spelling), which are known carcinogens. Imagine my radiation oncologist telling me to rub a cream into the scar twice daily -- and it has carcinogenic ingredients!!!",

I'm going to talk with my radiation oncologist about it since I'm not sure I want the extra radiation exposure to the BC side. As for the medical records, I talked it over with my husband (who has been away for nearly a month) and he agrees with y'all: I'm going to call and ask for copies for myself even if I have to pay for them. The problem is that the doctor at MD Anderson isn't a guaranteed thing until she sees the records and accepts me as a patient. So I have to play the game with the jerk, and be nice, until I get another doctor or I may be stuck without anyone to remove these stints!",

Funny story: they gave me something to relax me but \"not to knock me out\" before the SLN injections. Well, my husband said I yelled out that it hurt, but I didn't even remember the doctor doing it! I was getting impatient, saying \"where's the doctor\" and he'd been there and left already. I've got two drains and a pain pump. One drain comes out tomorrow afternoon. The other will probably be a couple of weeks. They found one positive lymph node and stopped looking at the others. Everything went to pathology and I don't even know the final size of the tumor yet let alone the extent of lymph node involvement. Those results come tomorrow or Monday at the latest. Will be on pins and needles until then.",

Make an appointment with the best plastic surgeon that your breast surgeon can recommend. Tissue expanders are used to stretch the skin and the pec muscle below so that it is ready to hold an implant in place. Unlike those who get breast enhancements, you won't have the benefit of having breast tissue around the implant. The good news with the tissue expanders is that you do wake up from surgery with at least some cleavage. I'm fairly small so that I was almost the same size with the new tissue expander as I was before the surgery. They go slowly on the fills mainly because you don't want to stretch your muscle too quickly. If you do, it's really painful. You'd have that \"Barbie doll\" look for a while until (or if) you decide to do nipples. There are lots of options for how those are done.",

They charged me $198 for a three-month supply. If I'd been willing to go back on the Vivelle-Dot, which is systemic estrogen, it would have been $10/month. Guess they'd prefer that I risk my life to have a healthy sex life again. My doctor tried to get the insurance company to override their decision but they wouldn't. Talk about short-sighted!",

Also, I'm 5'5\" and 115 pounds -- no extra tissue anywhere so I can relate to the lack of options. My experience: 1. The mastectomy laid me up for 24 hours. I was feeling fine by the evening of the surgery. There are lifting restrictions for a couple of weeks but I wasn't sapped for energy or very sore. I'll admit that frame of mind is important. I went into this feeling very positive and upbeat, and woke up joking with the nurses. 2. I had a tissue expander implanted beneath the muscle and had a high profile silicone breast implant done a few weeks ago. The new breast looks and feels fantastic. I can't wait to get the nipple surgery and tattoos so that it looks more normal. But it feels so real that I tend to forget it's not my natural breast. A few notes about why I had it done: 1. When I had my cancerous breast removed,  I developed lymphedema which limits my use of my left arm. I did not want to risk that happening to my right arm as well. 2. I didn't want to go through chemo and radiation again. 3. When they removed my so-called healthy breast they discovered atypical hyperlasia which can be a precursor to cancer. I was so happy I made the decision!",
