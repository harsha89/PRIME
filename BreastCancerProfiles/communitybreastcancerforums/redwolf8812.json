I feel great, thanks be to God, except for some bloating and discomfort after eating, but I'll take it. Praise The Lord. The CT report says I have a small amount of ascites. I'm a big baby in the hospital. Someone usually spends the night with me, my husband, sister, best friend, etc. I'd rather my husband be home taking care of our family but he'd rather be with me because he says I don't remember everything to ask and everything that's told to me (he's right). It's nice to have someone there who can get up and get you cold water or the nurse, etc. The medical staff at the Hospital of UPenn are awesome. They always do their best to accommodate us. Thanks for all the prayers, thoughts, love, and hugs. You guys are amazing. We all are, and we should never stop praying for ourselves and each other, no matter how bleak things look.

      "Content": "redwolf8812 wrote: Kelly hasn't been on here in a while and since I thought some may be wondering about her, she said I could post on her behalf. She's been fighting Stage 4 ILC her2+ for about 11 years now. Lately it's been getting worse. As most of you know, ILC likes odd places to settle. She's been through a lot of treatments and clinical trials but still keeps the faith. Here is a copy of her last message to me: \"...Not sure exactly what's going on Bc bilirubin is still too high. I really need tx. Tonight could tell the omental mets are bigger, similar to ascities it's like walking around carrying extra weight and I cannot stand up straight. Unlike ascities which at least could be drained just need tx to debulk them. Scary that it's 10 days and I still look a little yellow. Been sitting with Shay (Kelly's son) at night. Trying to lay groundwork a little that I may not get much better. Pallative care from Holy Reedemer comes Tuesday...Nurse checking in, social work. Maybe even help with house stuff. My insurance has been giving us a hard time with my drugs. Chuck (Kelly's husband) is fighting trying to get hours at work. The demotion thing isn't really working out but like he said is this best time to switch even if he could find something. So he is busy with that . Last week he was 2 hours away. I have advocated for myself forever and I just don't have it in me to deal with insurance. So they can help with that stuff too. I'm pretty much done with last oncologist except for the procedure again (Kelly had a stent put in her bile duct) if I can have it done. I am so upset with my treatment there. In hindsight my CT scans show progression in OCT. Should of been off trial then. I asked about liver MRI in OCT. Was told to ignore it. Only time anyone talked to me was when I sent threatening emails. Doctor admits she may of 'under appreciated' aspects of my disease. She ignored my liver for three weeks until I sent email that said, I could be dead, no one is addressing this except research nurse who said think positive. I'm telling her how bad I feel and she is like so your breathing is better. No it's worse. Having issues on steps. So if I cannot put better in chart can I put the same. I'm like I guess you are going to put whatever you want down despite what I say. ITS WORSE. Then I swore I was in twilight zone. In dec, tell trial nurse the pills really aggravate my reflux. She says absolutely not. That isn't possible and it must be something else. Then in jan she asks if my reflux is worse weeks on pills and Herceptin . I saw no it's bad in general but you said pills don't do that, she is like I never said of course they can. Chuck is like no you said exact opposite and the there was the \"bad batch\" of taxol I got that caused the rash. If they didn't almost kill me it would be funny. But I'm where I am Bc I didn't listen enough to my inner voice. I trusted wrong people. But it's not in my hands. I grateful and thank God for each day. Mets to so many many places. Not a lot of mbcers are still waking up with these mets. God has blessed us. I have havelen and navelelbine left. I didn't tolerate perjeta well but besides yourself I know two others that did the p/h with navelbline. So plan is if I can get liver to normal and have tx. Try havelen and then have p/h/n left. I just don't think I have the strength right now to do perjeta. I stopped it Bc of side effects cancer was stable. Exactly the same. Share my story anywhere. I always say, If I had to go through and something I did or went through helps someone out, maybe gets them out of dark place or helps with tx or se . I'm all for it. Last year a lady in FB was told she had stomach nets. Nothing to do and should go home and die. I said , have you tried TPN. How about some other things. She was where I was in 2012 with gastroparesis and bowel obstruction. Etc....She found new doc, went on TPN and has pretty good quality of life now. 9 months later. I feel like whole experience I went through really helped someone else out. Love Kelly\" ...but he said to me, \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.\u201d I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.

It's @2.4x2.3cm. The oncologist is waiting to hear back from the interventional radiologist to see if he still wants to ablate. If he does, assuming it's soon, I get a chemo break until after Christmas! Sweet Jesus! Then it's onto either halaven or gemzar with herceptin. They're \"confident\" that T-DM1 will be approved by February (gee, where have we heard THAT before?). I would prefer Gemzar, but Xeloda is also an antimetabolite (like Gemzar) and did absolutely nothing for me. (But then again, neither did herceptin). But I don't relish the side effects I've read about halaven. At this point, I don't know what to pray for, except guidance, because in the past, when I've fought for things, they've backfired. LOL - I still have the battle scars from the tykerb to prove it. I also seem to be allergic to carboplatin so who knows what kind of reaction I'll have to the next thing? Not the news I wanted, but it could've been worse, so again, I praise God for all His Blessings. I'm in His Hands.

So sorry to welcome you here and to know that you're having such a rough time, along with the stress that goes along with moving. It's important to get something in you that will stay down. Your body needs good nutrition to fight those liver mets. Have you tried ensure or something similar? How about yummy smoothies made with just fruit and crushed ice (the dairy from yogurt probably won't agree with you). At the very least, I'd try some gatorade to get some important electrolytes back into your system. What kind of nausea meds have you tried? Sometimes I have to take both zofran and compazine at the same time to successfully fight off the nausea. I pray the doctors give you better advice or at least set you up with a nutritionist. I know others will come along and give you some more advice here, also. Do you have any help? You're exhausted and it would help if there were someone to make you some dry toast or heat up some broth for you. If anyone offers help, don't be afraid to take it and be specific about your needs. Trust me, we've all learned that the hard way. Keep us posted on you. - Penny",

So my next schedule is both on the 22nd, Gemzar only on the 29th, off on 5/5/15. We have a family vacation planned for Florida 5/3/15 - 5/8/15. I just got an email that my liver enzymes have gone up since starting the Gemzar and wants to re-do labs ASAP. I pointed out that they've actually been progressively, but slowly, going up ever since starting Sir-spheres back in December, but this time, it was a big jump, in just a week's time, so I'm not sure what they have planned for me now. The oncologist had mentioned a couple of weeks ago that we could take the 29th off, if I feel I need/want better days to plan for the upcoming trip. Now I'm wondering if they'll just try lowering the dose. Think I read somewhere that sometimes that's tried until LFT's start coming down, then going back up to a regular dose. Any input, anyone? :-) Penny",

The pain was worse than childbirth. When I met with the NP to schedule the other lobe I told her about it and she suggested asking the staff on duty for the procedure for sedation or pain meds for those four hours, but now I'm wondering if maybe muscle relaxers would work better?

Maybe that's why you're having a hard time with the insurance coverage, cbrogdon. They've been doing them for years on colon and prostate cancer mets, and, of course, primary liver cancer. So many oncologists are opposed/unwilling to think outside the box that most of the time, bc patients with liver mets aren't even aware of the option. My first oncologist sort of waved her hand at me when I brought it up, along with chemoembolization, SBRT, and surgery, and said something to the effect that I shouldn't worry myself about all that. The oncologist I see now is much more open-minded and respects the fact that I research this stuff on my own.

As stage 4, it's assumed that there are always cancer cells floating around in your bloodstream somewhere, but if you're declared NED, it means that there is nothing large enough to be detected on scans. Some never get to NED. Some have it for weeks, months, or even years. As stage 4, you'll always be on some kind of treatment, whether it's just chemo, chemo with anti-hormonal meds, just meds, perjeta and/or herceptin, or whatever cocktail the oncologist and you decide is best for you. You'll even be on something if you reach NED status. Your hair will come and go, probably several times through the years, depending upon what treatment you're on. You can ask to referred to an Interventional Radiologist (IR) to discuss targeted treatments on the liver, such as ablations, Sir-spheres, chemoembolization, Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment (SBRT), or even surgery. Some patients have had better success with these treatments then with systemic (chemo, etc). Everyone is different, including your body's reaction to treatments. I say thank The Lord for the great scan showing no progression. Since you have no pain and no vomiting, I'd ask the oncologist if the mets have shrunk. Be your own advocate - learn your pathology (er/pr status, grade of cancer, etc). Learn about treatment options. Don't be afraid to get 2nd opinions. My first oncologist would not refer me to an IR. My current one has no problem working with one. Keeping you in prayer. Keep us posted. - Penny",

The only place I earnestly await is Your Presence in Heaven. I pray I'm considered worthy, that my sins, of which there are many, are forgiven, that I am welcomed by You and Your Mercy. I pray, Lord, that you will forgive me for wanting a little more time here with my family before going Home, but I also pray for the desire to accept Your Will for me, even if that means flying to Your Arms before I'm ready. But I know that if I'm blessed with acceptance of Your Will, I will always be ready. And since I've been blessed with otherwise-good health and a symptom-free existence, I know there will eventually come a time when I start to deteriorate and will desire only You. I pray you accept me. All these things I pray in the Mighty Name of Jesus, my Lord and Savior. Amen.",

Tomorrow @9:30 I'll be doing a simulation. They'll do everything that's done in the real procedure except the beads won't have radiation in them.

The 1st actual procedure may not be until after the holidays but we'll see how everything goes. I will probably be very tired tomorrow night, but I'll post an update if I can. Thanks for all your prayers. :-) Penny",

There are so many women out there who have been living with liver mets for years and years, probably because there are so many treatment options. Besides chemo and hormonal therapy, there's Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA), Sir-spheres, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT), Chemoembolization, and surgery. Some of these procedures can be done more than once. Just make sure you have an oncologist who is willing to consider those options. You'd have to consult with an Interventional Radiologist for all of them except the SBRT and surgery. SBRT is done by Radiation Oncologists and surgery is, of course, done by a surgeon who specializes in the liver. A great website to check out is: http://www.beatlivertumors.org Prayers, Penny",

Our Christmas (also my 11-year-old's birthday) was really nice, thanks be to God. She always gets to choose the dinner since it's her birthday. This year we had sloppy joes LOL. My family and my husbands all came over, ate dinner, and enjoyed birthday cake. New Years has come and gone in a blur because that same 11-year-old came down with strep and some upper respiratory issues. It's been meds and nebulizer around the clock for days now. My husband has been doing just about all of her care-taking since I really can't get too close to those germs.

Sometimes the IR (Interventional Radiologist) will use ultrasound to guide the stereotactic needle, but mine were done using CT scans. The liver area is numbed up and you're given twilight sedation. They wake you up periodically to breathe so they can locate/burn the area. Depending upon the size/number of mets determines the amount of time it takes, but I think @45 minutes is the average. Recovery is easy. They keep you in a room for about 4 hours before sending you home. The IR will probably scan you about a month afterwards to see how well it worked. I did not have a lot of pain at all. God bless you. All will be well. Keep us posted. :-) Penny",

The taxol/herceptin was shrinking my breast tumor but I still developed skin mets before finishing. Then I went on to epirubicin and cytoxan. By the time I got to surgery I had a complete response. Since we were concerned about the effectiveness of herceptin I went on tykerb while on herceptin after surgery. I developed a vicious allergic reaction to tykerb - a disgusting, itchy rash on my entire body. Every doctor on my team was positive that I was cancer-free, due to the complete response at surgery. When I was all done herceptin and had a pet/ct I was the only one not surprised that mets appeared, even though I had no symptoms.

I nap a lot, get off my feet, etc. Chemo side effects are cumulative so it doesn't always matter when she gets her dose. Some side effects we just have to live with and try things that make us as comfortable as possible. There's also a scrip that she can ask her oncologist for. I think it's called neurontin.

But I truly believe he takes bad situations and makes good come from it. My diagnosis caused me and my family and several friends to become closer to God; my husband and I have reconciled and love each other more than ever; etc. But every time I get MRI results I become more despondent. I don't think I'll ever hear NED (been fighting for almost 5 years), but I love Him so much and am so grateful to still be here and get to see milestones I didn't think I'd be around for. I also think, \"we all have to die SOME time. I just happen to know that I'll be going a little sooner than I thought and I also know what will likely kill me\". So I continue to say my daily prayers for me, my family, friends, medical team, and all cancer patients. I offer up my sufferings and pray it's working.
