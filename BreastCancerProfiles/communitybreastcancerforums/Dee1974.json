      "Content": "Apr 21, 2012 02:26AM - edited Apr 21, 2012 02:28AM by Dee1974 I am stage IV with mets to liver--my 2nd time after a brief clinical remission. I had a deposit in my bank acct 9 days after i turned in the medical release. With the release I provided all the treatment notes from my onc for the last 2 mons and each of my 3 mon PET scan results. I found out they didn't even request further docs from my onc, the lab, my surgeon, or the hospital. I'd been told by nurses at my clinic to send as many med docs as needed to prove my stage IV and mets. Keep in mind the decsion is made by the disability board in your state--not by SSA. They accept the determination of the state. They retrodated my disability date to my original dx a year ago even though I was told by the local nitwits my date would be the last date I worked which was in Dec, altho I was on intermit FMLA. I listed chemo brain, exhaustion, neuropathy, anxiety, side and aftereffects from treatments as my issues. Did you answer the question about the eventual outcome as death? That moves the request to the compassionate allowanceand they do call you within 1 day. Get a lawyer. Even though the amount they can charge you if you win is regulated, make sure they don't plan to charge you for postage, copies, etc.",
