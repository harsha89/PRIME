Please do not believe anyone that tells you that only benign fibroids cause pain so you are in the clear. With your family history, I would have it checked. It is most likely fibroids, but you can't be sure so better to be safe than sorry is my motto. When I was 28, I had some fibroadenomas and one grew larger (like you) and I had a fine needle aspiration biopsy. Ten minutes in a breast surgeon's office. It collapsed immediately and the fluid was clear so they knew it was fibroid. The pathology agreed so no issues after that for many years...until this past year when I was diagnosed with DCIS in the SAME breast, near the same spot. Please get it checked. Don't believe that it does not happen to younger women. It is rare, but it can happen. Just for peace of mind, go to a doctor and let them know what is going on. Most likely benign but you can't know for sure. Hugs!",

I know that my friend had a car accident years ago and had surgery and because of heavy meds they told her not to breast feed for a week, but her baby would not drink formula either so the hospital had some mothers that were pumping milk for the babies in the NICU that could not possibly drink it all and offered her some of the other Mom's milk (of course they were sure the Mom's were not drug abusers etc. I am sure) so perhaps you can ask?  I don't know anything else to offer you except a huge hug and I agree. Your baby will likely drink the formula with gusto if hungry enough and will be none the worse for it! Best to you tomorrow and moving forward. I am sure it will all work out in the end.

The reason I say this is because I was diagnosed with something called \"situational asthma\" right after starting exemestane which I thought was the culprit. But, I had finished rads just two months prior and it was my left lung that was acting up and I had rads on my left side. I was given an inhaler for difficult breathing days which I am thankful were few and far between! I was in a clinical trial and had 10 treatments of radiation in 5 days (2 x a day 6 hours apart) and it was at very high \"gays\" which is how they measure rads. I still cannot fully inflate when I am deep breathing but it has gotten somewhat better with time. RO does not think it is from rads although she did show me dosimetry report which clearly shows that a corner of my left lung would be in the field and could not be helped. I think she would like to not think it is from rads but I know it likely is. Am also having a bit of difficulty swallowing these days and think that too is from my rads. Sigh...",

I had cervical cancer way back in 1978 and my gyno says my BC is not likely  related as that is caused by a virus so don't worry that due to other gynecological issues you are definitely going to be diagnosed with BC.  After your tests, you will know more about what you are dealing with and then you can put a plan in place. If you have to have a biopsy, know that 80% come back benign. There are a lot of things that can cause lumps in our breasts. It is good that your doctor is making sure by sending you for the tests and specifically for an ultrasound as you are young and likely have denser breasts so that is a better way to see any abnormalities. Keep the faith and let us know how it goes.",

I had cervical cancer in my 20's (carcinoma in-situ) which I guess makes me more likely to get cancer again but not by much (4-5% more likely per my doctor) and so I am more than a little worried. She told me that the next step is ultra sound if they can't figure out what is going on from the films. What should I ask if I need to do this? Will they do it today or will they have to schedule this another time? I am praying the radiologist talks to me today about my results. Just wanted to ask what I should know/do/ask if things still look bad. They are doing this cause the micro calcs are \"clustered\" which I guess means they could be something. I have no lumps.

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2014 07:47AM - edited Nov 20, 2014 07:56AM by april485 My understanding is that microcalcs are formed when cells die off and leave calcium behind (like a gift..lol) and when they cluster together, this usually justifies a biopsy as this means they are likely malignant and multiplying quicker than normal and forming a lump or tumor (but usually haven't gotten that far with DCIS diagnosis being very early) but when calcifications are widespread throughout the entire breast, they are just dead cell calcium deposits and not a malignancy or a cause for biopsy. HTH!   Below is an excerpt from the website \"Radiology Assistant\" Intraductal calcifications These calcifications are calcified cellular debris or secretions within the intraductal lumen. The uneven calcification of the cellular debris explains the fragmentation and irregular contours of the calcifications. These calcifications are extremely variable in size, density and form (i.e. pleomorphic from the Greek pleion 'more' and morphe 'form'). Sometimes they form a complete cast of the ductal lumen. This explains why they often have a fine linear or branching form and distribution. Intraductal calcifications are suspicious of malignancy and are classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5. ",

I wish I had taken her advice and tried harder to put it out of my mind until I had to hear them. My results were positive for BC so now that is my reality. Lots of appts, surgery, radiation etc. So, please try to relax and just wait as peacefully as you can. Most results are b-9 as everyone points out so worrying is not doing you any good. If you can't stop thinking of it, try some distractions. Spend some time with your family, read a good book, go for a walk and mayb rent a good comedy! I pray that you get good news soon.",

I also agree with Melissa about using an NCI designated Cancer Hospital if you have one near you as they have the most resources and usually the best doctors for cancer as the rankings are strict. Please google for US News and world Reports rankings and also google CTA to find reviews. CTA claims they treat the whole person with nutrition and massage etc. I had all of that and more at my NCI hospital (YALE) and feel they did a great job. Best of luck whatever you decide.",

I have been doing BSE nearly daily and so far, they have been the same. I was told after the diagnostic mammo that I have clustered micro-calcs that appear B-9 and to follow up in six months.  For various reasons, I am uncomfortable with that (several risk factors) and my gut told me to explore further. I have an appointment with a BS to take a look at my films etc on 10/1. I have to wait a long time due to the fact that she is highly skilled at DCIS and micro-calcs according to all I read and she is located at Smilow which is the only BCC in CT where I live so she is very busy. Last night, I decided once again to do a SE on myself and sure enough, I felt a tiny lump where I did not feel one before, just above the nipple in the interior of my breast. It can't be seen outwardly but feels about the size of a pea. It is still there this morning so I did not imagine it. What the hell is happening to me? Is it my mind playing tricks? Am I just obsessed with this since I had not had any issues on my mammos since I had a needle aspiration in my 20's due to fibrocystic lumps?  This is really weighing heavily on me and I am scared as hell due to reading about how many BC's are missed on mammos. Last mammo, I had dense breasts according to the report which meant I could request an US if I wanted one. This year, the radiologist checked off \"Does not meet criteria for dense breasts\" WTF? Does it change? Anyway, should I calm down and keep feeling to see if this \"lump\" is real or imagined or should I try to move up the appt with the BS telling them I found a small lump? What if it is all in my head???

We still are treated similarly to early stage invasive cancers and in fact are treated EXACTLY the same as stage one with low oncotype scores. Most IDC begins FROM DCIS (although not all) that gets growing so if it is not removed, it is usually (but not always) a matter of time before we are right were you are. The reason some want to change it to a pre-cancer is the fact that many women opt for bilateral mastectomies which some doctors think is over treatment for this. I feel that if a woman wants to have a mastectomy (double or single) that should be HER choice. While I understand you being upset that a woman with DCIS was the face of Komen, (and I totally agree with you about this as this was not what they should have used) please understand how many of us with a DCIS diagnosis feel when some people act as though it was no big deal for us. I can tell you first hand that it was indeed a big deal and I am reminded of this daily when my joints ache from the aromasin and when I look at my severely indented and deformed breast which is brown now from radiation. I know Stage III is a very serious diagnosis of ANY cancer and I pray that all is well with you for the rest of your lives. I know that you are always worried about mets and I know that DCIS cannot metasticize so I can't understand your situtation truly. But, we were all given a diagnosis of breast cancer and I know I speak for many of my DCIS sisters when I say that we are getting a bit weary of being told we did not \"have cancer.\" Warmest regards. Just giving you a different perspective and I mean NO disrespect to anyone with a higher stage diagnosis.",

It is just that it is still a serious enough diagnosis from the point of view of someone who is going through all of the treatment that we endure and to have it minimized by a sister who should at least understand some of what we feel smarts a little bit! We have a chance that our BC will recur (although we do not have to worry about mets unless the surgeon missed seeing an IDC or ILC that we don't know about) cause we still have a higher than someone who never had BC chance to get an invasive form of BC in the future otherwise we would not have had to have Rads and take an AI or tamoxifen to prevent this. So, the worry is never over with this disease despite the stage at dianosis. Obviously with a higher stage, your worry is compounded by the possibility of mets and we do understand the difference. I wish you peace and hope that you never have to hear the words \"It's back.\"",

I just got called in for another mammo due to clustered micro-calcs (Birad 0 right now) and I go in Monday morning. Being the type of person that researches everything ad nauseum, I have had a crash course in BC since getting the call last week by reading through tons of things on this site. I am praying that I am one of the 80% that it is nothing. But, I am not going to lie. I am scared to death. Just a gut feeling that this is not going to be good. The next step for me if they don't see what they need to see on the mammo is an US according to my gyno. I have dense breasts for 57 and that is why I am likely to go to this next step of US according to my doctor.  Ugh, you are all so very brave. I have been praying harder than I ever have in my life and I am just wiped out from worry. At least I know where to come if the news is bad. You all are amazing. Some of you have earned an MD with all of your knowledge! So happy you are here! I may need you all. I hope that I don't though Oh and congrats on the outcome!",

It shrunk after lumpectomy to 5mm and grade 2-3 so more aggressive but smaller than they thought. I guess it changes after pathology from the surgery a decent amount of time. I did not get my ER/PR status until after lumpectomy though. They did not do HER2 at all with me. Am guessing due to it being pure DCIS. I was at Yale's Smilow Center which is a nationally ranked (NCI) cancer hospital so they are definitely doing the up to date latest testing. They did tell me my Androgen status (AR) after which many do not.  ",

Once I \"flunked\" years ago (it did not show up!) and they had me come back and it still was not there but they soon realized they had the threshold too high on the test for the small amount of medication I was taking. Also, if they write \"as needed\" on your script, you can always tell them that you did not need it that few days and you are within your rights so check what it says on the bottle.

It looks like Teri had not logged into that site or posted on there in a couple of years so perhaps her brother saw her log in information for a cancer site and assumed it was this one which means he felt he did what she asked him to do? It seems likely and plausible to me. As for the erroneous information from the Equine rescue site, they probably went on the assumption she already passed even though she hadn't? (At least the first one who told the second of her death did that) and that was the crux of this. It appears Teri's friend was right when she posted that Teri was resting at home still as her brother states she died on June 18th and that person posted in the beginning of June. So, in the end, it appears to be a big misunderstanding that caused a lot of confusion and pain for some.

I want to echo solfeo on the advice of never second guessing yourself once you decide what is best for you in terms of treatment. You have the added stress of having lost a first degree relative to this ugly disease so it will (and should) color your decision but hopefully, with or without medical expert guidance, you can decide what is best for you personally and what you can live with in terms of risk. I personally was very torn initially and was thinking mastectomy but after a long thought process decided to go with a lumpectomy. I had to have two of them because my margin was very narrow and I was in a clinical trial for partial breast rads, 2x a day for 5 days and it required a minimum of 2 (or 3, can't remember) mm all around and one of mine was <1mm so back under I went. Do I regret my decision to throw everything at my BC? No. I cannot and will not look back. I pray the same for you. Hugs!",

The Birads 4 rating is so insurance will approve the MRI or biopsy as they won't do it with any less and it is also a way to let you know that there is an area they want to look closer at. Our minds are very powerful and often play tricks on us about the let-down feeling. It also could be happening to you for sure and in no way do I imply you are not feeling what you are. Just wait and find out what is going on because worrying will not change any outcome for you either way. 80% of all Birads 4 are benign so hold on to that for now and let us know how it goes.

She did not know what drug she was given and her doctor was long since dead and his practice closed so she could not find out. I read that besides issues with daughters having a hard time carrying a full term pregnancy ( I had two miscarriages) and with clear cell cancers, cervical dysplasia and cancer is noted, and women who were in utero when mom took DES have an 80% higher chance of developing BC post 40 years old.

Also, does anyone know how long after lumpectomy you begin rads usually? Is it immediate? Ugh, so many ??? and so many different answers in the literature available. Terrified of doing rads on my left breast due to heart etc but more terrified of a return of Invasive or even more DCIS if I don't do all I can now. Such a rollercoaster!

I remember your birads 5 post and was hoping that you would be in the 5% that are benign. So, the bad news is you have DCIS. And, the good news is that you have DCIS! It is the earliest BC you can have. The final pathology will come after you have your lumpectomy or your mastectomy so right now, it is DCIS and as early as it gets. Even if final path shows some IDC, you will be fine! Micropapillary is the type that is seen under the microscope. Necrosis means it is a little further into the process of morphing into IDC but not yet there. Look it up here on the site for a better explanation. Grade 2 is intermediate growing , grade 3 is a little more agressive and right now, you have both types in your report. Hope that helps with your question No matter what, we are here for you.

With a relationship as you describe, how can you be anything else?   Your mom needs you to keep your wits about you as although she is not letting on, I am sure she is afraid right about now. While a Birads 5 is concerning for sure, it does not mean that she has advanced stage cancer, even if she has lymph node involvement (which still remains to be seen) and sometimes with older patients, some of the treatments can be skipped from what I have read. Not that your Mom is old because she most certainly isn't! But, they weigh age with very intense treatments such as rads and/or chemo and decide if the risks outweigh benefits. If they feel she would benefit, then she will be told to have them. Since we don't even know for sure she has a malignancy (even birads 5 sometimes hold surprise benign results!!) don't put that cart before the horse. I suspect you will have your Mom around for some time to come. HUGS and let us know how she does.",

My \"cavity\" is kind of lumpy with the seroma, but other than that, I just want to start and finish! 10 tx's in ONE WEEK! Hoping I don't have skin issues, but we shall see!

Because I am having the dose dense week long 2 x a day trial, I will have a CT scan all five days. The worst part was lying still with my arms over my head for 20 long minutes. My left shoulder was frozen in place when we finished and numb. I have bursitis in that shoulder. It hurt like hell! But, thank goodness it will only be 10 txs over one week! Hang in there ladies! We are gonna be healthy and cut that recurrence rate! I kept telling myself that when I was so nervous in the CT machine.

I do know that it is \"dose dense\" because of the shorter tx protocol. It is \"partial breast irradiation\" so it will likely be less than whole breast but not really sure. It is a clinical trial for one week rads 2 x a day. Due to the daily CT scans, I will be getting more radiation from those too but not the burning kind. I will also likely be doing the breath hold to get my heart out of the field since it is my left but she has not told me if I will need to for sure. My boobs are not big so not sure if partial is really possible for me...my whole boob will likely be in the field anyway she said. Nervous about those SE's but I know I will do this and be ok. After all, I have tons of information so many women never get if they don't come here! I will be done very quickly which is the plus. I will have twice a day..once at 7:30am and the second tx at 1:30pm. I will go to work in between if I can and am feeling up to it. Who knows what I will face? Since my tx is so different than everyones, I have nothing to base it off of except those who are having the 16 tx protocol which is the closest to mine that I have.

So happy that you know there is light at the end of that tunnel! As for having an implant or a balloon, mine is not that kind of partial breast rads. You are talking about either brachytherapy or mammosite neither or which mine is. I am having 4-D conformal partial breast radiation EXTERNAL BEAM which is basically the same as everyone else here is using but I get CT scans every day (a cone beam CT,not a regular one as that would be too much radiation which kind of makes me laugh a bit) to make sure it is pin-point accurate. This trial is so new, they did not have it in the dropdown on BCO so I chose the 3-D external beam option you see in my siggy cause that is the closest. The statistics are that 15-20% will have mild to moderate skin issues. Only 3-4% will have severe burns it said. Fatigue is the same as for whole breast protocols. Shrinkage of the treated boob is the biggest issue as this is about 3% more than with whole breast rads. In essence, I am having 10 boosts of 3.85 GR a day divided into the two tx's for a total of 38.5 GR to just the one small area of my lumpetomy site and 1.5 cm perimeter. They are basically gonna fry the area big time. Scary thought... They will come in from 3 or 4 different directions - the sides and then directly from the top. I will be on my back and in this thing that doesn't let me move. I don't know how many seconds my zaps will be yet. I have my final planning session tomorrow and will ask those questions. My RO is a woman and I love her! They will be keeping my heart and lungs out of the field (at least I hope so since my lesion is on the interior of my breast and very close to the heart) and in one week, done! I will go at 7:30am and at 1:30pm every day next week. The tx's must be 6 hours apart minimum. Once I begin, I can't stop or take time off in this protocol. So, I have to endure whatever comes unless it is so severe that they stop it themselves. Kind of scared but hey, I chose it. I could have had the 33tx protocol but I wanted in on the trial so here I go! Cindy, thanks so much for your message of hope and I want you to know it really does help me more than you will ever know! Heading off to work!",

I know you really got it pretty bad in terms of skin issues. Huge hugs and let us know the first day you can wear a bra again! We will celebrate! Report of clincal trial so far- Whew! I am starting to feel the exhaustion I heard tell of. I can barely function. I am not sure if by Thursday I will be working in between or driving the 45 -50 mins by myself. I feel kind of spaced out (is that what you all felt like?) and dragging big time... not myself as I am usually fairly energetic. This morning I barely made 1/2 mile on my treadmill and I stopped. Normally I pump out 2.5 to 3 miles every day. Also, the sting is starting. But, as a frame of reference, I am on treatment #13 in two days if I was having the regular 33 trmt protocol..13 is approximately 40% of 33 in case you are wondering how I came to that. But, tomorrow morning, I am HALF WAY THERE!! 50% done with trmt #5/10!  A tiny tiny bit of pink near the nipple but no other color/skin changes that I can see. I don't suspect I will see that until after I am done as that has been what has happened for others in this trial. Only ONE person had really severe peeling the RO told me. The rest was mild to moderate. I don't have much of an appetite today. I felt nausea again this morning and I made sure to eat some protein (Greek yogurt) before rads. I brought soup for lunch but couldn't eat it so I left it in the fridge at work and might have it tomorrow. That is about it so far. Just really really tired. Could also be other things though, who knows? Cindy, this may be redundant for you as I copied and pasted this from the Radiation Recovery thread cause why reinvent the wheel..lol Plus I am totally wiped out. Heading for the couch. DH built a nice fire in the fireplace as it is really chilly and damp. Who knows? By Friday, I may want to see only ICE due to feeling like I am on fire..at least my left girl might feel that way.

You might have what is known as a microinvasion which is treated exactly the same as DCIS and is in fact just a more serious form of DCIS but that is not even likely. You are truly worrying for something that has a small likelihood of occurring and although I know that it is hard, please try to stay away from reading things that are unlikely to happen to you. If it is found to have an IDC component, you will have no choice but to deal with that as it comes but for now, please try not to buy trouble where there is none. Grade 3 just means your cells look more abnormal than grade 1 or 2 do and that is due to them dividing faster. You got this girl. Ask your doctor for a Xanax or some Ativan and try to relax for now.

I had some pain and a few other \"symptoms\" and I didn't have a lump. The pain was in the area of \"thickening\" where my BC was eventually found. When the doctor was doing a breast exam and pressed on it, she knew it was thicker and that I jumped when she pressed there. I also had an itchy nipple and underarm. So many people do have pain prior to diagnosis so do not let a doctor tell you that \"If it hurts it means it is not cancer\" because it can be. There are a few threads on here about this very issue.

In the early days, it is much more scary (at least for me) but with time, there will be less time you will think about BC.

I will be having tx 2 x a day for 4 weeks (clinical trial) and then done! I will have a CT scan daily to make sure it is going to the exact spot so they can calculate it with the way I breathe etc. I will be having my simulation/tattoing and CT scan on Monday, April 1st. I am being treated at Yale in CT and the trial was perfect for me since I met all the criteria (early stage 0 or 1, >50 years old, small <2cm tumor size and wide margins >3mm's all around and lumpectomy only) for this one week, dose dense protocol and jumped on the chance to get it done. The trial has data from the last 9 years and it has shown recurrence rates that are similar or better than whole breast, full length rads (statistically insignificant differences in recurrence rates) so with my very early stage small (5mm) BC, I thought it was a good risk for me since many women forego rads altogether with DCIS. I had the \"fiducials\" put in yesterday (seeds of actual gold) around the lumpectomy cavity. It didn't hurt until the lidocaine wore off and then OUCH! Today it is much better though. Hoping that this will help women in my situation down the road. Shorter protocols are already being used in Canada (16 txs) the UK (also 16) and MMSK in NYC (16txs) so I know that many hospitals are moving to shorter rads. Mine will be 10txs over 1 week, 2 x a day. I am excited but nervous to get this show on the road. Hoping that I can avoid the SE's. Best to all the spring rads bunch!",

Mine will be concentrated within 1 cm of the are of my lumpectomy only. It is partial breast irradiation. With DCIS, cause it is confined to the duct, the chances of it recurring anywhere away from the original site are really really small as is stage 1 or even stage 2 so with the studies they have done, it is a tx protocol that makes sense. Since my boobs are small, partial for me means most of  my boob will be radiated anyway as the RO pointed out..lol",

Some RO's do rads in the \"prone\" position, lying on the belly with your boob hanging through a hole so that they don't nick the heart and lungs as well. You can also ask about that. Your boob has to be large enough to hang down far enough. The way I am being treated, I can't do that type since mine are all boosts in essence. So, I will likely be breath holding to push my heart out of the way. I will talk to her when I see her on the 19th for my final check before I start on the 22nd.

I don't know if my heart is in the field and will find out today if I will do breath holding as today is my final set up. They do have ways to keep your heart out as much as possible. LOL Cindy about SPF 50.8 Gr! I only need 38.5GR (unless I hear otherwise today at final set up) as that is what I read that partial breast rads is over 10 txs (3.85 per day divided by two) so maybe my SPF can be a little lighter...or not. Who knows? Another question I have for the RO today at final set up. That is in 6 more hours...no turning back now. Monday I start this party! Because no one is having this I have not a clue what to expect. The closest is my 16 tx buddy Lemon...and I know it was rough on her. Nervous is an understatement. Welcome Piperjo. You have a few weeks to build up. Ask your MO about your red count and make sure you are eating as well as you can. I hope you feel better!",

Ladies, it has been a wild ride and a wild week for me. I am tired but hanging tough and have worked all week in between treatments, even having to THINK! LOL... So, it will all be over tomorrow and I for one feel guilty that so many of you have to go 33 times when I had 10 trmts in 5 days. This clinical trial was a God send and since I qualified for  it with all the criteria met, I went for it. We shall see if I regret it as my REAL SE's are supposed to come within the next two-four weeks the RO told me. Also, I am already having the exhaustion so we shall see what skin issues the next few weeks bring me. Apparently we keep \"Frying\" from the inside out after we finish radiation for a little while. In my case, maybe even longer. So, I am almost done \"speed zapping\" as Cindy called it (still get a chuckle out of that and SPF9 Cindy) and I for one am a happy girl. Dusting off my dancing shoes (or my comfortable slip on mules since I am so tired..HA!) Hugs to all of you my sisters. We are doing what needs to be done to be HEALTHY forever! May we all be just that. xoxox",

I have olive skin and it is also sensitive and prone to breaking out from certain things. For example, I can't wear ANY costume jewelry or even silver because of the nickel. I am highly allergic to it. My jewelry has to all be 14K or above (18 k is better cause no nickel at all) so consequently, my jewelry box only has a few things in it. But, on the other hand, I always get nice gifts from the hubby..lol Hoping that the doc says you are done like adagio mentioned. Perhaps they will let these last tx's go? Either way, they will have to let you heal up first! I am off work today cause it is my Birthday!

LOL at \"freeboobing\" Since it is just me, hubby and my cat, I can free boob all I want but the question is do I want to hang it all out. My 58 year old boob ain't as perky as it was when I was 48..lol. I have slathered lots of Eucerine all over my boob today. If I burn, will get some Aquaphor. I have some mepilex (a friend gifted me the rest of hers as she did rads last year) so if I get a hotspot, I can still wear a bra since I am working through this insanity! Adagio, I am so happy that you are nearing the end of your trmt too with just boosts left. Wahoo! But, I am 20% DONE! 2 of 10 already finished. I am psyched! I can feel it a little bit though which kind of surprised me this early. My boob is kind of warmish and a teeny tiny bit pinkish around my nipple..nothing bad yet but kind of worries me since I have 8 more of these. My trmt takes about 15-20 mins total and that is cause at one point the techs have to come back in and turn the table around cause that is the one thing they can't do from out in the booth. My shoulder with the bursitis is pretty bad when they finish and I have a hard time getting it down from the behind my head position. Other than that, all good. Does anyone else kind of \"feel\" the rads as they are piercing your skin? I could. I know that sounds crazy, but I could feel a kind of \"tugging\" inside...can't explain it. Anyway, welcome Peki and congrats on doing a shorter protocol too. Mine is uber short though...I am in a clinical trial for partial breast rads which is like 10 boosts and DONE. Best to you! Runfree, you are very loved with friends like that! Amazing how many people step up to the plate to help you when you need it. My coworkers  donated sick time to me in case I use all mine so that I don't have to use my vacation time for sick time. Also, another woman who went through rads last year gave me a goodie bag with creams, sports bras, t-shirts etc. Ah, good friends are priceless! SherylB hope that your fatigue does not get too bad. Most people have said it comes and goes and that resting helps. If Cindy (RMlulu) is fatigued, man I want some of HER kind of fatigue. Our girl has more energy than the energizer bunny..lol MTjulie, you are on your last leg of the journey girl! Congrats and hoping it doesn't get too much worse for you. Laurascott, thanks so much! Congrats on being DONE! Woohooo! 7 boosts? Yowser, they really zapped you with 7 boosts to your area. Usually it is 5 I thought? Anyway, you're done! How great is that!!! I have a brand new respect for those of you who do this every single day for 33 days. I know twice a day is tough so to go day in and day out for 6.5 weeks must be incredibly hard. Love to all of my fellow warriors! I feel kind of guilty getting off so light...maybe I should not say that cause who knows how crispy I will be by Friday at the final trmt. I got to see a woman ring the bell this afternoon (At Yale it is a gong actually) and she cried and everyone clapped and I cried too. I am so emotional these days! I love everyone today. I feel like hugging perfect strangers. I am a total emotional sponge today..lol Will keep everyone posted about how it goes from here!",

I did not want to take a chance and not do anything but surgery but it was my PERSONAL decision to have rads and I respect all those that decide what is best in their case. I am also taking and AI and am struggling with this in a big way with side effects up the wazoo, but I am one who wants to throw all the weapons at the disease to ward off recurrence and/or a new cancer in my other breast or the same breast.

Reading these accounts took me back since I have a special needs child who in comparison to what you describe was a walk in the park. He has severe ADHD with mild Aspergers and he now is married, has two children and has his own business (because he had a hard time working for someone else big time) so obviously am not dealing with anything near what some of you describe and yet I cannot even IMAGINE what it would have been like raising him with Stage IV or even ANY BC! His social skills were non existent and he was teased mercilessly and shunned by the other kids (which broke my heart a lot more than it broke his) even though he was very smart and tested out at an IQ above average. He kept me hopping constantly and I had more meetings with school social workers and psychologists and PPT tests and speech therapy etc. I worked full time as well and I thought I was going to lose my freaking mind half the time, even in a two parent household! (although most if not all of this fell on me) He was very high functioning but also very high strung and change put him over the edge - actually it still is hard for him as an adult of 35. Also, he could not take any of the prescribed meds as he had terrible facial tics whenever we gave him the prescriptions to the hyper activity drugs and any other drugs made him break out in hives. I had to do it all with consistency, diet and constant monitoring and it was exhausting! How did you manage? I really think that love drives this bus more than anything else. Just know that my heart is with you and that you are amazing! Still can't even imagine this with my son, let alone with tougher things. Huge hugs and respect.",

As for the first time finding it and not sending you right away, if you are not post meno, the doctor probably wanted to see if a cycle would change the lump or have it go away. Menstrual cycles often are responsible for benign lumps. BUT, since it is still there, your doctor is doing the right thing by sending you for testing. Most BC takes YEARS to manifest so the urgency voiced by the poster above is not necessary as nothing will change in two weeks or less most likely. Wishing you benign results and please keep us posted. 80% of breast lumps are benign until proven otherwise so your odds are still good that it is nothing. Hugs!",

So, when she snipped, I jumped about a foot off the table! Hurt like hell. She felt really bad but it was already done. Ouch! I am blessed in the healing department though.

Often the only part of the diagnosis they are concerned with is the invasive component if there was both types - DCIS and IDC. That is entirely possible as they always treat the IDC and the DCIS just comes along for the ride. Hoping that is what the confusion was as it seems way too odd that the BS would say 7 cm by 4 cm and then find out the lesion was less than a cm. I guess I was reacting to what would happen if that happened to ME as I only wanted to have lumpectomy if at all possible. My breasts are on the small side so if I had a 7 cm lesion, I would have had to opt for mastectomy, even for DCIS. Best of luck and hope you find out all of the facts soon.",

From what I understand, that is one of the ways lumps form...from debris shed by the rapidly dividing cells. For example, that is why they will often watch microcalcifications carefully over a 3 or 6 month period. If they cluster together or form a linear area, they are generally cell debris shed by something that is dividing quickly (many times a cancer) so that is why they biopsy a larger area than just where the calcs are located. If they miss (and that is easy to do because they are going in blind unless the clip was placed properly during a wire guided stereotactic biopsy) they must do an excisional to make sure. Best to you and keeping fingers crossed it is all benign debris from a pre-cancerous area.",

I had my lumpectomy yesterday (pain today a 5 out of 10 which is pretty decent although last night was no picnic but mine was deep in my breast so that might be why) and my next appts are with a Radiology Onc and a Medical Onc after my post op appt with my BS. I have been told my tx's will likely be rads and an anti-hormonal  so I guess those of us with DCIS usually are treated the same for this disease, provided we are ER/PR+ as far as the anti-hormonals are concerned. I don't have my path report yet on the lumpectomy so I have no idea if they got clean margins etc. No lymph nodes were checked as it did not appear necessary from my biopsy. We shall see if that changes post path report from the lumpectomy. This journey is FILLED with decisions from start to finish which seem so overwhelming. Once we make our decision on the tx path to follow (for example, my first decision was whether to have a mx or lumpectomy) we have to just trust that we did the right thing for US, not for anyone else. We all have our own ideas of what risk we are willing to live with. For me, for such a small lesion (no lump, microcalcs) I did not want to lose my breast if I didn't have to and lumpectomy has been found to be equally as effective when combined with radiation in long term studies. For me, as much as I dread those SE's from rads, it seems to be a good option so that I can keep my breast and move on. I don't know how I will feel when I actually finish that tx, so I may be singing a different tune after the fact! The anti-hormonals are another story. I already have arthritis so I am not looking forward to those but then again, many women do very well and have minimal issues with those too. Since I am post meno, I will likely be given an AI like Femara or Arimidex. I know they come with plenty of complaints so I am preparing for the worst and hoping for the best!

No one can tell from just a film if it was caught early or late. The only way to know that is pathology and staging.
