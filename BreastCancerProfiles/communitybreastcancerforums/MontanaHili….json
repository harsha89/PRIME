Six weeks post surgery seems too soon to be deciding what is comfortable.  I couldn't stand anything touching the skin over the surgery site (caused a burning sensation) for a couple of months.  I worked on getting my range of motion back & hid in a big bulky sweatshirt ( I also live in a cold climate).  I think my summer wardrobe solution will be a strapless moulded cup bra with some home made filling in the empty cup. This wouldn't work for everyone but, I'm small & never had much to project anyway.  Spend your money on what you really need or makes you happy.  Good luck with your know-it-all fitter!",
