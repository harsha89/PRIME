They usually give nystatin cream or powder to use. I do Dove unscented for sensitive skin, but concerned because it contains a moisturizers and afraid it would be too moist. Also try to expose your breast to air as much as you can renee, let them know you are getting pink this soon. I just started to burn the other day, but with the silvadene and steroids it looks so much better. Today was #25 so last of entire breast rads. Monday will start the first of 5 boosts!",

At first, my BS said anyone with a score over 25 should have chemo, but then said the study compares it to Tamoxifen. She said the other AI drugs are much more effective than Tamoxifen, so my risk of recurrence was lower and I wouldn't be on tamoxifen. I think with chemo, the percent would only change to 4% so risks would outweigh benefits. She is not an oncologist so waiting to hear what MO says",
