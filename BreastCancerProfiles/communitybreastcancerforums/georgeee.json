I have one close relative with breast cancer ( stage 3 ) which was treated with surgery before 4 years.....After this she had some radiation sessions....and after this medication...( Tamoxifen but not 100 % sure..... ).... Some other examinations that time showed that her cancer type was not dangerous for metastasis.... Everything ok until last 6 months when she did last examinations....Before 3 days she had new examinations.....results CEA is 6.3 , CEA 15-3 is 225....CEA 27-29 is normal....liver examinations ggt , alt , sgot , and one more which i cannot recall..... quite high above normal ..... MRI shows that new multiple cysts 1cm are found in liver....sth that was not found in last one which was on 2012....diagnosis below MRI states that these cysts could be malicious....but does not state something 100 % ... Latest Doppler test of liver was before 6 months and liver condition seemed normal...... Tomorrow we will go to the doctor with all these results and results of some other examinations we are waiting for....... Could it be something else different..... ? Maybe something else going wrong with liver...... ? I cannot wait until tomorrow.... waiting for your opionons....thank you Log in to post a reply",
