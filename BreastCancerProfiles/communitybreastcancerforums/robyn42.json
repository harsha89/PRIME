I had a unilateral mastectomy of the left breast and immediate reconstruction via TRAM flap. I did not do any chemo or radiation. I also am not on any folowup drugs like Tamoxifen.  My oncologist actually gave ME the choice as she was fine with it either way.   Around the time of my 1st 6 month screening I found a lump in my reconstructed breast. After a biopsy it was determined to be necrosis (or hardened fatty tissue that probably didn't get as good of circulation).   About a month ago a felt a lump at on the upper part of my reconstructed breast..back near my chest wall.  I mentioned this to my regular Doctor at my yearly papsmear. She then asked me if they did mammograms or anything to my reconstructed breast at my screenings. I said no...and then she said she was ordering an ultrasound. So I went to my next 6-month screening and they find the spot via ultrasound.  Now I get to go back on Tuesday morning for another biopsy.  Sometimes I fell like I'm \"crying wolf\"....you know? I'm trying hard to remain positive, but it sure isn't easy sometimes!  Have any of you had similar findings?
