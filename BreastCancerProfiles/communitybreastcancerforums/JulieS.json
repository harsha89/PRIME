I feel FABULOUS! My onc told me \"we are going for a cure--you are fit and strong.\" I was 65 and there were times during treatment when I felt I might not be as strong and fit as he thought I was. I made it through TAC--6 treatments 3 weeks apart, 30 rads and 5 years of Arimidex. The first 6 months were horrible, the next 3 were O.K., the last 5 years have been the best of my life. Hunker down, do whatever it takes and enjoy the rest of your life which will probably be a long one.",

Could hardly move in the morning at first and didn't sleep. No longer have the joint paint but still have some difficulty sleeping. I exercise a lot in hopes of being tired and keeping my bones healthy. I am curious to see if there are differences when I go off Arimidex but am half hoping my onc decides to keep me on indefinitely. He says there are a lot of studies in place to determine if long-term use is better. I feel a little scared to think that I won't be doing anything to ward off a recurrence. JulieS",
