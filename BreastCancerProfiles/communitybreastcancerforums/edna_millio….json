I've really been alarmed lately because the soreness is suddenly worse, and it just feels weird (although no weirder than it has felt in the past). I can also feel the lumpy scar tissue very prominently, but realized that since I've recently lost about ten pounds (intentionally) and my bras are too loose, that's the problem... yet I still freak out! I tend to forget that it HAS happened before, and any kind of jiggling/bouncing/etc does make it worse. A tight bra is helping, as is forcing myself to STOP POKING AND PRODDING IT. I don't know how you stop freaking out about it, although seeing how common it is REALLY helps.",
