Fortunately, I was able to get my evaluation appointment on Monday, and then I can go from there.  It looks like I will have therapy several times a week for three to four weeks, is this pretty standard?  Being a teacher, this is going to be hard - but I do want to get it under control as quickly as possible.  At this point, I do not have a debilitating condition and I don't want it to get that way. Linda - I especially want to thank you for the pictures.  I was suspicious, but busy and consumed with chemo and probably would not have taken action so quickly if not for the pictures on this thread that convinced me that I had lymphadema.  My arms look just like those pictures, and when I went to see my surgeon, there was no question.",
