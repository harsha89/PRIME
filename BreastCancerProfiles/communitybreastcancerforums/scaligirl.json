Hair loss is pretty much a given but the risk of permanent hair loss is very low. I think I read it was between 1 and 2 percent. Scary stuff for sure, but the odds are with her. Some people mentioned cold capping. I decided to just to with losing my hair and not trying to save partial hair. I lost my hair around day 17 and then had some growth pretty immediately of random hairs all over my head. Now that I am post-chemo my hair is starting to grow back in all over. As for the \"stuff\" you need, I looked at that recommended list at the top of this Chemo forum list (there's a Shopping List post) and pretty much bought everything I read. Biotene, immodium, pepcid, senekot, wet wipes, tylenol, omg you name it and I got it. I ended up using pepcid twice after my third chemo. The rest remain untouched and unopened in a (also-new) bag I bought to take with me to chemo. Honestly I would probably just wait if I had to do it all over again. You can always go out that day to get anything you really need and don't have at home already. It will all depend on how your wife reacts to the chemo, and everyone on this board has had different side-effects hti them. Probably the only thing I would absolutely recommend you get is pepcid, because that and any anti-nausea medication you get from the Oncologist will help keep nausea at bay. Best of luck to your wife!",

I actually didn't tell anyone (except my husband) anything until after I had a firm diagnosis and plan for treatment. That was about 6 weeks after my first diagnosis. I had numerous biopsies and finally my lumpectomy before I told my family first, which I did in person. Then I told my closest girlfriends, but this time via text because I could not get them together for the life of me. Everyone else read via a very long Facebook post a couple weeks later, which was timely because it was in October, which is BC awareness month. Oh and then I let some work people know because I had to take a LOA to do chemo. Really, you don't have to tell anyone you don't want to. It's your business. And yes, it's stressful to tell people because in some ways saying it out loud to others makes it more real. The thing with my family that made it easier was having all the information in my head, so I could go in with a \"relatively\" positive message about what I had and what I was going to do about it. It was very reassuring to both myself and the ones hearing it that I had a plan and knew exactly how I was going to beat cancer. That carried over to the other conversations too. I hope that helps. Good luck!!!",

I thought about using minoxidil too but nixed that idea because my Onc told me once you start you can't really stop without losing some of your hair again. That seems like a lifetime commitment for short term gain. So the wait continues for me.... come on hair! I took this pic this morning, so 7 weeks PFC. I am actually starting to notice my dark brown hair growing back beyond all the wispy grey/whites that are longer. It is all very short and still seems to be growing super slow even though I am taking 10,000 mcg of biotin a day. It makes me really question how much less I would have if I wasn't taking that. I am really thinking it is going to be months and months before I can ditch the wigs and hats. Maybe in another month I will be confident enough to rock the \"recovering from chemo\" look with super super super short hair. Right now I have too much shiny scalp showing through to even think about pulling that off. From a few feet away it's like I have a little brown halo over my head LOL.  Oh and like lots of others, I have pretty much lost all my eyelashes. None on the bottom, and maybe 6 individual lashes over each eye. I'm experimenting with false lashes but I totally suck at it. It's very comical and I make myself laugh every time I try. I'm gonna need to buy like a dozen to practice with over and over before I don't feel like I have caterpillars on my eyes. I have about half my eyebrows but they are definitely thinning. I need to go get a waterproof brow kit as my pencil is definitely too smudgy after a few hours for my liking. Hope everyone has a great weekend!",

I'd really appreciate any success stories on dosage. Thanks in advance!!",

I have learned so much about bc and all the tests and results types, and it has helped me immeasurable in preparing for conversations with my medical team. I was just diagnosed last month. I had an annual mammo that turned up some suspicious sites so they asked me to come back in for a repeat and an ultrasound too. The u/s confirmed there were three suspicious sites that weren't there in last year's mammo. so we went ahead with a same day biopsy. I was very lucky that the radiologist had a pretty open schedule that day. The pathology came back a few days later - one site DCIS (stage 0, ~8mm), and two other sites that were right next to each other IDC (both stage 1, one 5mm and another ~9mm). I had thought the next step was to schedule surgery but my doc wanted an MRI to get a better look at the space between these two areas so tell her whether a lumpectomy or partial mx would be the right surgery for me. The one site was at 9:00 and the other two at 10:00 so fairly close to one another. The MRI told us a good story for the space between the sites - very clear so ok to do a lump, but then the MRI also showed this other site that wasn't seen on the mammos. Que biopsy #3. In the meantime, we had a lumpectomy scheduled (playing the odds). The results from that finally came in ONE day before my surgery. No cancer, but something that we all decided to remove anyway. I have to get my hands on the path report to see what that was actually called. In any case, went in for the isotope injection last thursday afternoon, and oh my god did that hurt. I know I read a few posts about that not being too bad and they inject you with a local beforehand, which they totally did with me too. But damn if that injection didn't hurt like a red hot poker to my breast for a good 10 seconds straight. I honestly don't know why they bothered with the local because it didn't seem to do squat for me. My surgery was last friday 9/8. 3 lumpectomies on my right breast, plus the sentinel node biopsy, and now I am just trying to take it easy at home this week. I travel for work so can't really do that while I can't lift anything heavy. Yay restrictive work fields. Fingers crossed my pathology from the lumpectomy comes back with clear margins and nothing else actionable. I should hear the news by this Wed or Thurs. I have my follow up with my surgeon nx week. The plan is for me to start taking tamoxifen and then do 4 weeks of localized radiation a month after my surgery date.
