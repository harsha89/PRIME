      "Content": "AusMum wrote: Hi everyone, I'm 33 from Western Australia. Was at the gyn for another matter a few weeks ago and asked him to do a breast check while I was there. He found a lump and told me to wait until my next period was over to see if it was just hormonal. Course I couldn't wait so went to the GP. She couldn't find lump. sent me to have ultrasound/mammogram anyway. Had that on the Tues. They found lump and it wasn't cyst. (6mm) Booked in for following day for fine needle biopsy. Had that on the Wed. Got results on the Fri from GP - biopsy inconclusive. Was quite upset as basically thought I'd have the results (yay or nay - not further tests to find out. Referred to breast specialist/surgeon. Saw specialist yesterday. He advised get lump removed and tested. Booked in for that next Wed. Will the results of that biopsy be able to determine the grade of cancer IF it is cancer?? The whole thing has been an awful emotional rollercoaster. I've been pretty upbeat most of the time but yesterday I must admit I was getting pretty down about it all and today hasn't been much better. My biggest fear is my small children not having a mother and that sort of thing - irrational at this point in time but hard not to think about. Thanks for reading! Log in to post a reply",

The encouragement is just fantastic considering I am utterly fed up with the whole medical profession. Their communication has been quite disappointing to say the least. I just had my lumpectomy yesterday and that ice suggestion sounds like a good one! (Course no one at the hospital told me that). Don't get the results for 2 weeks...more waiting! Arghhhh!!!",
