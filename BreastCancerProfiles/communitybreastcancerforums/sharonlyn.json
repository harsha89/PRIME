I had a call back on my mammogram and am scheduled for a biopsy on the right breast because of calcifications. I am beyond panic thinking of surgery and radiation again. I didn't get to talk to the radiiologist about the mammogram and what her thoughts were. It is classified as a 4a. I have another week to go this has been going on since the first of the month and I am worn out from stress. Just needed to vent with people that have gone thru the same thing.
