BMX, one side IDC with axilar lympth nodes removal (1 with Ca. out of 8), other side DCSI,with sentinel lympth nodes removal (3 nodes removed, none with Ca.) Both breast Ca. are ER+/PR+, HRC2-, grade 2. Treatment: dense chemotherapy (4 AC + 4 Taxol every two weeks) Radiotherapy not needed. I wonder why radiotherapy is not needed. If they are right or not. What were your experiences? Many thanks. Log in to post a reply",
