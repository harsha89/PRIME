I have a 2.5 x 2 cm tumor. Also the MRi says there are at least 3 intrammammary lymph nodes in the outer and deep portions of the  breast, also additional ones identified in left axillary region I am also ER-PR positive and Her2nu negative. I have surgery scheduled for Dec. 13th But with this new info not sure if I am making the right decission.Also not sure on follow up say radiation chemo hormone therapy as will not know till after surgery and path studies are done. Oh also was told the grade 2 but not sure if that changes with new path reports after surgery.I was diagnosed  Oct 29 of this year after a mamogram, ultra sound and the needle core biopsey. I have read all of your posts and my heart goes out to all of you and you are all in my prayes. And yes sorry I had to join your club, but now a life time member. You give much advice and comfort  but I rarely see anyone on here with invasive lobular. Just read on another site that if intammammary nodes have mets it appears to be a prodictor of poor outcome. Heck I was tring to have a some what positive attitude but now  I am terrified. NO more terrified now. Any advice or similar situations  please respond. You are all wonderful !!! Thank you in advance for any and all info. Scared is an understatement, I want to live for another 50 years.
