Pall, PhD ImmuneSupport.com 08-04-2008 Advertisement [Note: for information on the NO/ONOO(-) cycle, see \"Nitric Oxide Cycle Theory: Will It Explain CFS, FM, and Other \u2018Unexplained' Illnesses? - Q&A with Martin L. Pall, PhD\". Dr. Pall is author of the groundbreaking book, Explaining Unexplained Illnesses] Post-radiation syndrome is proposed to be chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or a chronic fatigue syndrome-like illness, initiated by exposure to ionizing radiation. This view is supported by the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite (NO/ONOO(-)) cycle mechanism, the putative etiologic mechanism for CFS and related illnesses. Ionizing radiation may initiate illness by increasing nitric oxide levels via increased activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and consequent increased synthesis of the inducible nitric oxide synthase. [Some sources of ionizing radiation include X-rays, gamma rays, radon, atomic weapons test fallout. Types of radiant energy that are not ionizing include microwaves, radio waves, UV light and visible light, according to the World Health Organization.] Two types of components of the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite cycle have been studied in post-radiation syndrome patients and shown to be elevated. The symptoms and signs of post-radiation syndrome and its chronicity are similar or identical to those of chronic fatigue syndrome and can be explained as being a consequence of nitric oxide/peroxynitrite cycle etiology. While the data available to test this view are limited, it provides for the first time a comprehensive explanation for post-radiation syndrome. Source: Medical Hypotheses, July 29, 2008.
