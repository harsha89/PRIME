That is not to say that you might still have an ill fitting garment, but it certainly would make things worse to wear it to sleep in!",

I just have to say that I was DONE w/Dr. Susan Love and her depressing website way back when I was first diagnosed and going through treatment. SO, I know that she is well respected by many, I just happen to NOT be one of her fans. These days I know that specialists in lymphedema have questioned the use of sleeves when someone has not yet been diagnosed w/lymphedema. The thought is that if the arm is over-compressed that it may actually cause a lymphedema that may otherwise not show up. This includes wearing them for flying. Both of my LE therapists have stated this at different times and they are at two different ends of the spectrum, where one has been doing it forever and goes to con-ed and the other was LE certified in the last 2 years. This does not of course, change things for someone who has already been dx'd w/LE. ALL precautions and use of sleeves/gauntlets/gloves are still there. BUT, they are both on the same page regarding blood draws, IV's and BP's - it is contraindicated for a person at risk for lymphedema. Again, I am a bit biased because I am not a big fan of Dr. Love's, but these are the things I have learned. But, alas, I already have lymphedema... so ALL precautions relate to me!",

I was triple neg - so one would think that my doctor would not care if I use it, but he had a little hissy fit and offered me antidepressants instead (which I refused - I am not depressed, I am estrogen deprived!). I stood my ground and told him I can't be intermittently screaming at my family and sitting on the floor sobbing all day. Anyway, if it is something that your doctor would allow -and he/she may not because of your ER status - I use the phytoestrogen cream by Emerita. Initially I used it once a day (I think the directions call for twice a day - it was the only compromise I would give to my doctor) but now I am only using about every other day and I find that I need it less. It was really beneficial to get me over that hurdle in the beginning though! Otherwise - I agree about the exercise advice - if you can get a good work out in, you will be too tired to listen to your husband breath and you will release some good endorphins in the process! Good luck with this - hopefully it will start to smooth out soon and you can start to feel somewhat back to your normal self!",

My breast surgeon never even referred me to a plastic surgeon at the time of my cancer. She told me that that part was not important. It was completely unfair to me as a patient, but I was young and had a hubby in graduate school and a little baby that I needed to care for. Researching and fighting her on it were not really on my agenda. But if I had to do it all again... I would try to do things the way I wanted the FIRST time! Good luck to both you and your sister.

The funny thing is that the Y totally had a yoga instructor with 400+ hours of certification training... but they did not want her teaching the cancer survivors because she refused to modify anything for them. So yes, I understand that part of it too. Maybe because of my background and because I really don't give a... um... crap, what people think - or what the instructors say - I modify accordingly and ignore them if they tell me to do something that I know is detrimental for my lymphedema... or any other part of my body!

You guys give me WAY more credit than I deserve. I am not a model patient, for sure. But my thought is, what is life worth living if there is no QUALITY to it? For me, I would be a disaster if I could not do the things I love, so I do them , sometimes knowing there is a price I am going to pay. For skiing - no, I am not afraid of falling. I do fall once in a while, but it is rare (knock wood!). I learned to ski when I was 3 and except for about ten years off - split up here and there, I have been doing it ever since. We have taught my girls to ski the last couple of years and it has been tremendously rewarding. Another year or two and they will be sailing along! As for cycling - yes, I pay for that. I wear a compression garment all waking hours for the most part, so definitely during cycling as well. I change hand positions frequently. I do not wear a glove, but do always wear some form of cycling glove, which seems to help keep fluid out of my hand, despite that that was not what they were made for. I will do shoulder rotations (arm circles) during my rides and fist pumping as well. Plus having good posture and body mechanics during your ride will help - think tucking your shoulder blades down and across to the opposite back pocket. This keeps your shoulders from rounding forward and in addition to helping prevent increased swelling, it also keeps your lungs opened up so you can take some deeper breaths. If I am going to do a long ride (think 45 miles or more - or on a really hot day) I expect to use my flexitouch once or twice in the days after to bring things back to baseline. I personally consider it a small price to pay, but we all choose what we are willing to deal with, right? People always ask me what exercise is best... I always say the one you like enough to keep doing...",

So, I personally would use it if conservative treatment fails, and by that I mean physical therapy. Hugz - can you get a referal to PT? Your lymphedema therapist may not be the best person to treat your hip - it all just depends on his/her training and what they focus their continuing education on. I agree with Kira on anti inflammatories, rest and ice. The initial key here is decreasing the inflammation, so if that means resting for a few days then that is what you need to do. Then PT for range of motion and gentle stretching. But decreasing the inflammation is where you should start. Hang in there. Multiple hugs.",

When I came off of treatment, I was SO tired all the time. I would lay down everyday with my daughter and take a nap. My hubby and I went on a five mile hike that next summer and I didn't know if I would make it back... Okay, granted it was 98 degrees out... But still! This is something that would have been so easy prior to treatment! For me, it has been one step at a time. One goal at a time. My biggest goal was to ride the Seattle to Portland ride in 09. I bought a bike that Sept. and didn't really start training until April (it kind of rains a lot around here). The ride was in July. Prior to ride day, the longest ride I had done was 36 miles. STP is 204 miles -- which the majority of the riders do in two days. But my goal was to do it in one. And I did. It took me over 12 hours of ride time, over 14 hours when you included stops. It was a huge accomplishment (and one I don't know that I ever care to complete again! 100 miles is plenty... Heck, somedays, 10 is plenty!) and I couldn't have done it without Lance.... Lol. Armstrong. He was my inspiration. Everytime I got tired I thought, \"if Lance can come back from cancer and win the Tour 7 times, then I can finish a measly 200 miles today\". And I thought this a lot, since I was tired a lot - and had a lot of solitary ride time. Anyway, my point is - I am glad to pass on the inspiration that I got from Lance and from my brother and husband who cylce too. I have a triathlon tomorrow. I know I am not going to win. I know I probably won't even be in the top half of my age group. But the only one I am trying to best is me. Finishing is always good. Beating last year's time will make it better! You girls can achieve anything. So you go for it. And know that I am always here cheering you on! Picture me with a big pair of blue and white pom poms and a megaphone!",

And I have a multitude of other reasons why I do it (most of my family members are morbidly obese and I fought an eating disorder all through high school - exercise saved me from my demons) but sanity is the main one. I use it to blow off steam when I am hurting, or angry... Or both. A couple of years ago I miscarried at 11 weeks. I was devastated. It still makes me a little sad to think about actually, but at the time I was so, so angry. I couldn't get through it. I was angry at my family. Yelling at everyone, crying spontaneously. I finally went to the gym and hopped on the treadmill. And that is where I stayed, with tears running down my face until I could not go anymore. It is cathartic for me. And, just like anyone else, I have days when I just don't feel like doing anything - which is usually a sign that I need to get moving, and days where I am just physically tired- which is usually a sign for me to allow myself time to rest. It is extremely important to \"listen\" to your body. Sometimes we just need to back off a little and we will feel better the next day. I love to ski. I love the smell of fresh snow and the feel of my legs working like a couple of pistons. I love taking jumps like a teenager and finding a fresh powder stash no matter how far I have to go to get to it. And I love to go fast. I will ski until they tell me that if I take another run I am going to have to hike back to my car (our mountain has a mid-mountain access, so if you ski down after the chairs have closed, you will be hiking back up to your car!) I love to ride my bike. It is almost the same feeling I get skiing - but atleast skiing I don't have to worry about cars! I love zumba and weight lifting. I like to run. I tolerate swimming, only because I have to do it to participate in triathlons, but it is really not my favorite. There are so many things you can do... It is just finding the activity that you love and trying to stick with it. I used to resent having to wear my sleeve to exercise, but I don't care anymore. I am back to doing the things I love and if my crazy sleeve has to be a part of all that, so be it. You ladies are all doing soooooooo awesome! Keep up the good work! I am cheering you on! Oooooo, yes, another thought is to watch for overtraining as you start getting back into things. Inability to sleep and an increased resting heart rate are two things to watch out for. If either of these occur, back off a little. If it does not get better after doing that, check with your MD. Otherwise, you go ladies!!!!! woooohooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!",

Any OTC sleeves, anyone can buy and I self measure. My LE is stage 1-2 and is unilateral. You can wear any kind of bra with the silverwave sleeve, if you are talking about wearing it as shown - it simply crosses the upper back, much like a bolero jacket. It does Not provide much compression on its own, but like I said, I cut it then use it in conjunction with the other sleeve for air travel. As for buying all these different sleeves... I have probabably spent way too much money trying different things. My favorite gloves are OTC, also purchased on the Patterson medical website. I have both an Elvarex OTC and a custom fit as well as a Juzo OTC, and I can tell you that all three of those turn my finger tips purple and make them turn into bulbous tips. The one from Patterson is comfy and does the job as needed, when needed. I am lucky that most of my LE has stayed out of my hand... But that is because I am always on top of my arm. I recently had a test that showed almost zero fluid drainage on my arm, so if I did not stay on top of things, it is safe to say that my arm would be humungous! I cannot go more than an hour without compression as it starts to ache with fluid back up. Every arm is different though. What works for me, may not work for someone else. I am happy to try to help however I can! You can always post questions to me -- I am pretty much an open book -- and I will try to check back more often. Otherwise, Binney and Kira are fabulous resources here! I think this is the glove I have. I don't wear it much, thus have not had to order for a while, so not 100% sure: http://www.pattersonmedical.com/app.aspx?cmd=getProduct&key=IF_45672",

      "Content": "Nov 17, 2012 05:46AM - edited Nov 17, 2012 05:47AM by Nordy Ha! I found them! Okay, here is what I have to say about this glove/sleeve combo - first of all, it is not your normal compression sleeve - it WILL roll down, is not very form fitting at the wrist (or likely just at my wrist which is pretty small), and overall would never provide enough compression to most people on a normal basis. So why use it? Well, for me, it works the best when I am going to be fairly sedentary and not moving my arms around -- such as on a long flight or during surgery! The gloves are built into the sleeve, there is absolutely zero constriction at the wrist and none at the top of the arm, because there is NO top band. I use in conjunction with the silver wave for a couple reasons, one being that the silver wave does give me compression at my wrist, so that takes care of that issue, and second that it provides overall more compression while helping prevent fibrosis. I love the combination of the two together. This way, it is also easy to pull the top sleeve off when I have to use the restroom or wash my hands, while still maintaining some compression. Anyway, this combo may not work for many people. My arm does better with a lighter compression than a heavy one (although at night it does best when I wrap it) - so I am in no way encouraging people to scrap a method for flying that works for them. This is just where I have had success and I have tried many different sleeve/glove combinations. I generally will not wrap for flying, but that is mainly an issue that has always been because I am usually flying with my kids and when they were in diapers and even now, wiping a dirty hiney, is not really conducive to clean finger wraps - even when using the other hand! Then it is hard to get a decent hand washing done! Anyway, the website for the oversleeve is: www.pattersonmedical.com/app.a... Remember if you do decide to try it, to buy the opposite arm so that you can wear the seams out instead of on the inside.",

I am NOT a good patient. No major exacerbation, Dr. Massey just wants me to try to maximize the potential of therapy. So... I was wrapped at PT, then came home to blue fingers and pain. Immediately unwrapped and rewrapped to where I can stand it. I hate paying for people to wrap me when I can totally do it myself and NOT turn my fingers blue! I have already informed my PT that the wraps have to come off tomorrow so that I can fit all my ski gear on, as I am going skiing. I can envision all the notes in my chart about my noncompliance... Wa, wa, wa. ;) I told her I would wrap the minute I get home and showered. As for biking-- Yes! My hubby and I did a duathlon last weekend (run, bike, run) and it was a blast! And then I rode again Tuesday night. I have not done much else thIs week- running kids all over creation and PT, and had family in town the beginning of the week. I hope to be back to a more normal routine next week! All of you ladies are rocking the exercise! I love it! Kira, I am trying to read back and figure out what all is going on.

      "Content": "May 10, 2012 11:58PM - edited May 11, 2012 12:01AM by Nordy Hello, hello! Okay, while I was out on my run this morning, I was thinking of you guys and it crossed my mind that maybe not everyone realizes how important a good cool down is. So I thought I would let you know! Whenever you do an activity, you need to slow it down at the end - bringing your heart rate and respiration rates back down. By cooling down, you help decrease that amount of muscle soreness that you may get. But the real kicker - especially for those of us with lymphedema is that cooling down will help prevent blood pooling in the extremities. This is when blood and waste products, such as lactic acid, remain in the muscles, causing swelling and pain. Yes, I said SWELLING! Just what we don't need! So here are the three key factors to cooling down: 1. Gentle exercise - also known as slowing down the activity that you are already doing. If you are running or walking fast, go slower. If you are walking at a modrate speed - go slower! If you are cycling - slow it down! If you can't slow down the activity you are already doing jog or walk to bring it down. The key here is to bring your heart rate and respirations back down 2. Stretching! This is soooooo important, and really is the perfect time to stretch! Your muscles are nice and warm making them way more pliable than when they are cold! All major muscle groups need to be stretched - with extra attention to those used in your specific exercise activity. I will always recommend a hold of 20 a 30 seconds. Make sure you breathe during stretching! That oxygen will help those muscles relax! 3. Refueling! Your body needs fuel replacement after exercise. And not just water - although this is a MUST. In addition to fluids, you need carbohydrates and minerals (specifically electrolytes - sodium, potassium & chloride). There are many ways to get these key ingredients back into your body. Of course there is Gatorade and similar drinks, there are tablets called NUUN, there are bars, which you make sure you drink plenty of water with... And then there is chocolate milk (if you drink dairy) - it has the perfect blend. Orange juice is also fabulous as a recovery drink - as are the Odwalla and Naked juices. It all depends on what you like and what works for you! I like Nuun tablets, chocolate milk and orange juice (NOT all mixed together! Lol). My husband is anti dairy, so he likes the Naked and Odwalla juices, Gatorade and orange juice. We try to stick with more natural foods, but sometimes you just need to refuel on what is available. And that is my unsolicited advice for the week! If you have found any recovery foods/drinks that work for you let us know!",

End of the year stuff and recitals is making me a crazy woman! Hugz, hmmmm, grinding does not sound as much like a muscular thing as a catching or snapping feeling/sound would. I am assuming you are referring to the glute medius? It is a difficult muscle to strengthen since some of the other ones that tend to get tight will take over the motions when the medius gets weak. The key to strengthening that muscle is to make sure you are doing the exercises precisely that are specific to it. I hope your chiropractor is addressing any muscle imbalances with specific strengthening and stretching? If not, maybe ask for a referal to a good orthopedic PT. As for the 5 fingers - yes, I own some. Yes, I have run in them, do I like them? Yes... and no. My biggest issue in running in them was when I would run over a rock. Ouch! The soles are really so thin- they are the closest thing to being barefoot! So any large rock, feels like a large rock! My toes are too short for the new 5 fingers that have a thicker sole. They tork my little pinky toe and pull it to the side! So, my new favorite shoe is the New Balance Minimus wt20. You can find them for $69 to $99 at onlineshoes.com. I love them so much that I bought a second pair (they tend to run a bit small, so I ordered up a half size and they are perfect). They are also more of a barefoot shoe - no support, low heal, minimal sole - but enough that I am not in agony if I run over a rock! Keep in mind that if you intend to run in the five fingers, the wt20 or any other minimalist shoe, that you need to ease into it. The typical running shoe has an elevated heel that tends to put people into a position where they have a heavy heel strike during running - minimal shoes encourage a midfoot or forefoot strike - more like what little kids do when they run barefoot. So, it uses a lot more calf muscle than most people are used to. So ease in! Too much too soon, HURTS (I know this by experience!) and you could set yourself up for injury. However, I have to say, that I suffered from painful knees for years with running. I still have some kind of medial miniscal thing - but my left knee no longer hurts at all, and the right knee does not hurt at all when I run. It hurts when I do things like pidgeon pose and the medial side of the knee is compressed... so not related to running, but to the old injury! Good luck with your new shoes! I hope they work well for you! Bathroom dancing.... Running on the train.... Reaching for margaritas... You guys are hysterical",

You are the one who worries about your future. You are the one that spends hours at the oncologist's office. Nobody can do any of that for you. And if YOU need to rest and not be stressed, then you should be allowed to do just that. My mother-in-law came twice while I was in treatment. My daughter was about 4 months and then 6 months old at the time. She created more work for me. I refer to her as a cat: always laying around waiting to be waited on. It was so stressful. After the second time, I told my husband I would rather be alone while he was working than have her there lounging. But that is her personality. My family comes to work & help out... His mom comes to relax & be waited on. You know your sister in law's personality... Which one is she? If she is a hard worker, and you can absolutely not get out of it, maybe it will end up okay.

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2010 09:44PM - edited Apr 4, 2010 09:45PM by Nordy KC - I know it seems kind of crazy to \"go against the current\" so to speak, but this is how it is done. I cannot remember if you had rads or not - if not, you may still have some drainage through your axillary nodes on the dissected side - if you did have rads - it is quite possible that that drainage area is really not very good - if it exists at all. The key to MLD is to direct the flow to areas with lymph node beds that are working correctly - usually the groin on the side of the affected arm and the opposite axilla (armpit). The key is to get the fluid to cross the watersheds - the areas that essentially separate which area the fluid normally drains (think \"Continental Divide\"), then once it is across the watershed, to help move it into the normal lymph drainage for that region. I know it seems odd, but MLD and complete decongestive therapy (including wrapping and specific exercise), has thus far been the only \"tried and true\" treatment of lymphedema - because it does work. In the case of the hip to hip scar - your therapist may have to get creative - such as bringing the fluid to the back, then down the trunk, then sweep it around the front to the groin, below your scar line. It can also be brought across the top of the chest (above your incisions), to the opposite axilla. As these Barb and Binney have said - it is important that the nodes are emptied first - these would include the cervical and supraclavicular nodes on both sides, axillary nodes on the opposite side and inguinal(groin) nodes primarily on the same side - but would do both sides as well. There are also supra-pubic nodes that could be drained. Deep breathing is very beneficial to clear the deep nodes and drinking plenty of water will help to dilute the lymph fluid, making it easier to clear. I am concerned about you having pain, however and would ask your therapist more about that. Good luck to you - I hope you are feeling better soon.",

Yes, a second opinion, from both doctors actually, is in order. You are triple negative, you are stage 2... I am certain being young and triple negative, your cancer is probably a grade 3... or at least a grade 2. How is this not your decision? I was dx'd at 37 w/a little baby - after 5 months of neoadjuvant chemo I also opted for mastectomy, and I also opted for radiation despite that my tumor was nearly non-existant after chemo. However, I did have positive nodes prior to chemo (2), but they were clear after chemo. They left the choice up to me, but said that I could go either way. My thought was that I had a little baby to raise and I wanted to do everything within my power to be here to raise her and to try and stay cancer free during the remainder of my days! Sometimes people don't get it... triple negative - we don't have the option (or those that do have that option may tell you the burden) of Tamoxifen or Herceptin, or Aromatase Inhibitors... We currently have 3 modes of treatment: chemo, surgery, radiation... That is it. It is your decision. I know that it kind of depends on the size of your residual tumor (what it is now that you have had chemo). I will tell you one thing that is in your doctor's favor - radiation does increase your risk of lymphedema. This is the risk I took and I did indeed wind up w/lymphedema... If I could do it all over again and look ahead, maybe I would have chosen not to have radiation... but maybe I would. Things are always so much different in hindsight! My thoughts were strictly on staying cancer free and raising my child... but lymphedema is also for a lifetime. And if I did get a local recurrance I always would have been wondering if I should have had the radiation. In the end, my baby was worth living for! We make the best choices we can considering the information we are given at the time. So.... You have a lot to ponder... but having a second opinion certainly will not hurt. Good luck to you in all you decide.",

As far as the hand piece/gauntlet - I do not wear one either. It usually causes my fingers to swell, where they do not normally. The only time I wear a hand piece is when it is super hot outside and I start to accumulate fluid in my hand or when I am flying. I personally think your therapist is right on, but there may be others on here that disagree. Both of my LE therapists have stated that some new studies show that if they can head off the lymphedema in that first year w/a compression garment and drainage, that they are seeing a resolution of lymphedema - although you will always be at risk. But seriously, I wish I had had that the first year, because indeed, my lymphedema was really high up on my arm and very mild. If I could have headed it off w/proper treatment... maybe I wouldn't be so uncomfortable today!",

Isn't that bizarre? I know when I am getting any kind of virus before it hits because those nodes will get uncomfortable.

One of those pathways happens to be draining in the groin area on the same side of the body that your surgery was on. I would consider an eval with a good lymphedema therapist to get fluid moving. Another thought is some vascular insufficiency, but given the circumstances I still think system overload. Check in with your doc and ask for that eval.",

Leave a message with the answering service and they should put you in touch with either your doc or the doc on call. This will give them a heads up. Are they definitely doing a lumpectomy or just a core biopsy? A core biopsy only requires a local anesthetic. Hang in there. I am keeping my fingers crossed for benign results!

So... about 5 years ago I tried wrapping my entire arm with Coban. I thought maybe I would see if it was any different than the short stretch bandages - maybe it would be better?! Well, it certainly was different. It was so uncomfortable, I ended up ripping it off during the night. One thing I will give to Coban is I do like to use it on my fingers. I have got the wrapping of it down to a science - because it is super easy to wrap too tight with Coban. I am able to use the Coban wrap on my fingers for about a month before I have to toss it and start with a new one. For me, this is more cost effective than buying the Elastomull - which always seems to shred and unravel long before its time. I would like to try the finger wraps that are washable... now if I could just remember what website I saw them on!!! In the end - having to buy Coban twice a week is not cost effective. The fact that it is SO easy to wrap too tightly with it is a big red flag. And the fact that they are trying to do away with CDT is absolute insanity. CDT is the best way to help the body learn to reroute lymph fluid to other node beds for drainage. Good heavens... anything to make a buck... anything to save a buck... and they obviously don't care who suffers for it.",

Using those abdominal muscles helps to empty your deeper nodes in your trunk - thus creating that negative pressure effect and helping to move lymph. I wish I had a horse!

The Casley-Smiths flew in and trained about 20 of us in LE therapy back in 1992. I ended up going into acute care and orthopedic PT instead, so did not use much of my training (which is why I don't comment too much on LE issues and you will find me giving my 2 cents more about orthopedic stuff). She has been doing this since then, and has seen alot. In fact - I contact her when I have specific questions about my LE, even though I have 3 LE therapists here in town. She just has nearly 19 years of experience behind her and she is an excellent resource! Cookie - My lymphedema also started in my upper arm. I had NOTHING below the elbow for about 6 months... and then I took a step class. All that waving my arms around stuff and the next day it was in my hand, my forearm, my elbow. And it hasn't left my forearm since(my hand is pretty good, knock wood). It is still in my upper arm too - but once it moved into my forearm the tissue started to become fibrotic. Especially after I started using my JOVI pac in place of wrapping. I don't think this is an issue with all the Jovi's - I think it is because my therapist ordered one with a zipper, and it ends right at my forearm and makes an area where the lymph flow is essentially cut off. I recently started wrapping again - that along with accupuncture and a lymph cream (now can't think of the name of it) has helped reduce my arm from being 2-4 cm larger than the other to being 1-3 cm larger. I am hoping with a few more weeks of consistent night time wrapping and foam inserts to break up the scar tissue will bring it down some more. The other thing that contributed to my LE getting worse is the use of compression sleeves with the silicone band at the top. I didn't realize that it was making such a difference until I started measuring my arm every day after removing my sleeve. I have since tossed a few of the Juzo dream sleeves (which I loved) and am now wearing only the Jobst off the shelf - and at a lighter compression of 15-20 most days, 20-30 for exercise. For me, less is more. Who knew? It is all trial and error. I feel like an ongoing experiment and now that I have learned to document everything, I am able to see if there is a pattern on what is working or not.  Okay, so I didn't mean to be so long winded! Not sure what happened there! Cookie - go for LE therapy - just because it is not below your elbow doesn't mean it is not lymphedema!",

I have seen three docs that do microsurgery for lymphedema and they are have various opinions. Actually I have had the opinion of four surgeons. The consensus of three of them is that my lymphedema is not severe enough to do surgery. Having said that, let me just state that I am type A about my arm. I wrap nightly, I wear my sleeve daily, I try to eat right, I defintely exercise... All the things I am supposed to do. AND somehow I have managed to shrink my arm by 1-2 cm (was it the Ketoprofen, essential oils, exercise, wrapping, self massage???) over the last two years, however, it is still 2-4 cm larger than my uninvolved arm. if I am without my sleeve for any length of time over 20-30 minutes, my arm starts to ache and swell! It is a constant battle. I am going for one more consult next month, but I am thinking I am going to live with this. My greatest fear is a donor site lymphedema and if I couldn't fit into my ski boots it would be the end of me. As it is, I always have boot indents after skiing all day (lymphoscintigraphy was completely normal for both lower extremities). Maybe in a weird twist, being denied surgery by the surgeons was really the answer to my prayers that I did not really want to hear. Maybe in my lifetime someone will grow some from stem cells in a petri dish and be able to just inject them into the axilla! Fingers crossed! As for you ladies, please keep posting. I am constantly sending you positive energy, vibes, good karma, wishes, prayers and anything else positive that I can conjure up! (((((Hugs all around!))))))",

He is awesome - but when I asked about anastamosis last year, he prefers VLNT for the long term results. I don't think I have posted here for a long time... I gave up my fight with the insurance company after battling with them for 3 years. In my fight, I managed to get them to change their policy to include out of network providers for breast cancer patients (something that they had an written an exclusion in before and allowed only in-network doctors for that diagnosis only!) - so hopefully have helped many other women who were initially not given an option other than the crappy in-network doctors around here. But after all that - and a phone call from the one person who was allowed to approve treatment from my lymphedema, the insurance STILL turned me down and when I went to find that one person again, she was no longer there. Seriously. Let go? Moved to another department? I don't know, but I finally had enough of the emotional roller coaster and disappointment. That does not mean I have given up hope, because I still have it... just not willing to fight with insurance for the time being - and actually feel a sense of great relief when I made that decision. It was just so stressful!!! Plus, my lymphiscintigraphy on my right leg was not good (despite never having swelling in this leg) in addition to my right arm, AND I tend to have some swelling in my left leg (which had a perfectly normal lymphiscintigraphy - again showing how much of an imperfect test this is) - so I think it may be easy to say that my lymph system is somewhat f*cked up. Which made me fairly uneasy about having lymph node transfer since I do SO many activities with my legs - and I am with you Trishia - I do not want nodes taken from my neck. I am not a heavy build and that will be one scar that will be hard to hide and if I ever bite the bullet as I age and get a face lift (LOL - no, I am NOT kidding you) I don't want to be at risk of having some weird puffy face because I don't have nodes in my neck... no matter how slim the chances! Anyway, although I am not currently fighting with my insurance company, I am still looking at treatment, but looking more at lympho-venous anastamosis. I am seriously considering saving my $$ and heading to Italy to see Dr. Campisi. His research seems to be the most prominent and he does a LOT of them. I know here in the states, Dr. Granzow and also Dr. Neligan do them. But I don't know if it is the same technique as Dr. Campisi, I believe he makes some connections that are deeper so they tend to not be as fragile as the more superficial ones. I will let you know when/if I decide to take up this fight with them again. In the meantime, I keep socking away $$ fully intending to have to pay this out of pocket someday --- which in reality will probably will be cheaper to do out of the country anyway!  Kharimata - was it you who had the Hebrew saying about those who believe??? Well, I have never stopped believing... just finding lots of brick walls to climb along the way... :)",

I LOVE wearing this sleeve (I got the bilateral silver wave 15-20 mmhg). It is comfortable, and guess what - my arm was smaller than normal when I took it off tonight. My LE therapist loves it because it has the waves in it and having texture really helps with fibrotic tissue. It fits my unaffected arm fine, but is a little big on that side (obviously). But here is the thing that I think I am really going to like about it (but of course I have to test it biking to see for sure) that is it is actually cool. I don't mean the look of it (although that is fine as well) - I mean the temperature. I wore it under a short sleeved shirt today thinking it would keep me warmer, but it actually had a cooling effect on my arms. Which is GREAT - but I needed to wear a light sweater today for warmth (if I had just dressed for the winter season, like I normally would, it would have been fine). SO, thus far, I give it two thumbs up!",

      "Content": "Jun 10, 2012 08:05PM - edited Jun 10, 2012 08:05PM by Nordy Vln-- the one thing I would say is that you may be able to resolve some of that by doing your best to keep the fluid down in your arm. If your cellulitis is fully resolved (and I am guessing that it is) - you need to go back to all those things that help decrease lymphedema. Yes, that means mld (self or treatment by a certified MLD therapist), elevation and compression. If your arm is weeping, it is a sign that there is too much fluid there. You need to get this under control - there is nothing that contributes more to infection than moist, damp areas. In addition to that, the weeping in itself leads to little pathways where bacteria can get in - it is not a one way street for fluid just for fluid to get out. Does your compression sleeve still fit you since your episode of cellulitis? You may need to be refitted so that the sleeve helps rather than harms. You say that the tribute keeps things under control- is your arm damp in the morning when it comes out of your night garment? How much larger does it get during the day? If you have so much fluid backed up in your arm that it is coming out of your skin- this sets you up for other things such as skin tears and infection. Your best line of defense right now is to resume CDT - sterile, breathable bandages as lining followed by padding with foam and short stretch bandages. You may have to change them frequently depending on how much the limb is weeping. Once you and your therapist get a handle on this, then it is advisable that you resume use of your daytime compression garment - making sure to moisturize properly, not ony to maintain the integrity of the limb, but to provide a bit of a barrier to bacteria. I did a resea rch paper for work several years ago when the flesh eating bacteria was on the rise and one of the main things they daid to protect your skin was to moisturize it to provide a thin barrier on the surface of your skin. You don't want the weeping to keep going on, so my best advice is to contact your certified MLD therapist. If you don't have one, please post back and we will all help you find one. Hang in there!",

My husband makes fun of me, but the last time I ignored a cut on my finger I ended up with streaking up my hand - and had to hurry and get some antibiotic ointment on it! I have never ever heard about the peroxide thing, but I can tell you that in general we don't like to use peroxide for wound therapy because it can inhibit healing. You are better off washing a cut out thoroughly with soap and water... having said that, though, I have been known to use peroxide if something looks like it is getting infected - followed by the antibiotic ointment and a bandaid. I am pretty certain I must be single handedly contributing to multiple bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics! I hope you start feeling better soon.",

My biggest issues are that I need a breed that does not shed (a deal breaker for my husband) and one that does not start out with a ton of bad habits. I don't mind working with a dog, but my husband is only letting us have the dog because I begged and whined and used everything I could think of to get him on board. SO... I am hoping that starting off with a puppy and training, socializing, etc. etc. will make it less stressful (if that is the right word?) for him. And hoping he will fall in love with it too... but of course know better than to get my hopes too high. I still check the humane society's website everyday while I am waiting for my pup and just found a poodle/cocker mix. We may go take a look, just for fun - and then we get to pet all the dogs while we are there - but I really hope I am making a good choice on breed. Maybe I need to PM Jane!",

Having said that, I never did wrap my arm for surgery (and I have had MULTIPLE since being dx'd with LE) - but I have a favorite sleeve that does not cause my arm to flare when it is at rest. I wore it during every single one of my surgeries. Not only does it help my arm, but it reminds the nurses and MDs not to use that arm for anything. As for DIEP - there is a lot of talk regarding how it can sometimes help lymphedema as you are replacing scarred tissue with new healthy tissue. I cannot speak for that, because I had flaps from my hips - it neither helped nor hurt my lymphedema - but helped my overall self esteem immensely.",

Well, those of us in the \"know\"... you know, who have experienced lymphedema first hand, and also those of us with a certification in MLD and lymphedema treatment happen to know that MLD works. Quite honestly, my arm is so finicky that sometimes I can't wrap, or I wrap and have to pull it off a couple hours later. When I have MLD, I can feel the heaviness move from my arm to my upper back (where it likes to go) until the therapist moves it across to the contralateral axilla (opposite armpit). So... we all know it works and I wish I were there to take a stand for MLD!",

Here are the things that I have found to work VERY well: Good old coconut oil. It solidifies at room temperature (unless you live in the south or during summer - little messier then!). To use I have a... ummm, applicator from a monistat package. Plunge it into the hardened coconut oil, then use like you would any vaginal medication. It does melt once it is in you, so be careful you are not running around the house right after!  I buy mine from Whole Foods, but I think you can probably get it almost anywhere.  Vitamin E suppositories. I love these. They are convenient and not messy. You can get them at natural stores - Whole Foods usually carry them. Insert about 5 minutes prior to your couple time and whoola - a magically lubed orifice... LOL Yes brand lubrication from Great Britain. Yes, it is pricey, Yes, it works and Yes, it is paraben free - which I love. (Do I sound like a commercial?!) But they do ship for free if you order more than $60 (US) worth. It is all natural and you can choose from water based and oil based. I really like it and so does my hubby and despite the fact that it does not seem like there is much in the containers, we have had ours for several months now without running out. And we blend both the oil based and the water based. Plus you can buy the water based one as a single use \"plunger\" kind of thing - a litte tip that inserts and then you just squeeze the bulb to apply the lube inside - where you really need it the most. Which is really the reason why all 3 of these things I have mentioned work. I try to tell my husband - it is not the \"outside\" that hurts - it really hurts deep on the inside! Thus lube that is inserted works the best! ",

And I was stage 2B. First of all let me tell you, you do NOT have to have a perinatologist over see you. Your cancer diagnosis does not have anything to do with whether or not you can carry a baby to term. The fact that you have had BM does not determine whether or not you can carry a baby to term. What does make a difference sometimes is the course of treatment. Having radiation will not affect a pregnancy, provided that you do NOT have radiation while you are pregnant! It is just like any other high level radiation risk for a baby - you want to avoid it! Having chemo would affect you - during the chemo, but not later, unless you were to go into permanent menopause! Okay, so my story: I was diagnosed at 37, one day before my baby turned 3 months. I had 16 rounds of chemo followed by R mastectomy, and 30 rounds of radiation. I was triple negative, so no further treatment. I had excellent response to the chemo and shrunk a 4 cm tumor down to less than 6 mm by the time of my mastectomy. Then almost a year to the date after I was diagnosed, my sister was. I then opted for a L mastectomy as well. I had spoken at length to my onc about having more children... I explained to him that for me, the clock was ticking and that I didn't want to wait the usual 2-3 years that they often recommend. I told him that my husband and I had discussed the possibility of recurrance and possible progression of cancer - if that were to happen and that my husband was prepared to raise more than one child if that were to be the outcome. My oncologist told me this, \"There is no positive research that says that another pregnancy will cause a second breast cancer. If and when your periods come back, wait three good periods and you can start trying again.\" Well, it took my another 9 months after those 3 good periods to get pregnant again. I had a regular OB, a planned c-sect (only because that is what the other one was - nothing related to cancer), and a perfectly healthy baby and pregnancy! AND I am high risk because I am old(er). I am going to find you an article that is on this site that actually talks about pregnancy after cancer and that it may actually help to reduce risk of a second breast cancer. I was a little worried, because I did find my lump during pregnancy, but they had thought it was just a clogged milk duct and waited until my milk came in to further investigate... but in reality, that lump had been there for a LONG time for me. I had found it 7 years earlier and it was the size of a hard pea. I had had an US and it was negative... then for some reason it kind of disappeared... maybe it went dormant or something... but I certainly felt it grow at the end of my pregnancy. So, did the pregnancy \"cause\" my cancer? No, but I certainly believe it added fuel to the fire that was already there. So, speak with your oncologist - if no rads and no hormone therapy (tamox), I don't see why you couldn't - especially at stage 0! The hardest part I had was not being able to breast feed... it really took me some time to adjust, but I had some close friends that donated some breast milk, so I felt some comfort knowing that my baby got some breast milk, even if it was short lived.",
