Had ultrasound then core biopsy last week. Monday my GP called advising cancer and set up apt with surgeon who I saw today.  He was very thorough and went over all info in the pathology report. invasive ductal carcinoma with lobular features Nottingham Grade 3. is 1 cm.  stage 1.  No indication of lymph node involvement on examine but not yet tested. He went over surgical options and had his office set up appt with oncologist on Monday.  Really liked surgeon and hoping oncologist also good so I can stay with treating facility which is close to my home. He gave me copies of the report which I have read quite a few times. Understanding more of the various tests each time but starting to be overwhelming.  I am planning on getting second opinion from top cancer facility in my area but I know from previous experience can take a while to get appointment and I really do not want to wait too long.  so much information so quick difficult to process.     Log in to post a reply",

May not need chemo but will not be able to complete the treatment plan until all results in. Saw second opinion surgeon on July 16th. The team recommended breast MRI as my breasts are very dense and ultrasound not definitive enough. Then biopsy of right breast as I have calcifications in the right. The Surgeon also offered genetic testing as my brother has prostate cancer and my grandmother died from Ovarian cancer but those results would take a while and delay surgery. I have decided not to wait for the genetic testing as it would not change my decision. MRI scheduled for July 31st. I see surgeon after that to schedule right biopsy. Once those results in I will make decision on surgery. Both doctors assured me that there is no emergency and encouraged me to take deep breath, wait for all test results to make a good informed decision on the surgery. Still scared which I guess is normal but not feeling so overwhelmed. I have decided to go with second opinion surgeon who is very through and specializes in breast surgery. Now that I have my treating physicians in place feeling better but the waiting for all test results difficult as I just want everything to move fast.",

Very hard for me initially as I Lived with my sister and her husband.I am just recovering from losing my sister at age 66 to COPD in 2012. Then her husband diagnosed with 4th stage lung cancer in April 2013.  I was his main care giver and manager all his chemo and radiation. He passed in August of last year. By then I had lost a lot of weight and was not in good health. I since gained back 20 pounds and now at 105 lbs feel healthier and emotionally better than I have been for 4 years.    Took a break for a day and just enjoyed the weather and family. Helped a lot. Feeling refreshed. Actually looking forward to first visit with oncologist so can move forward with needed treatment. I am not going to make any quick decision on the surgery until I have talked with oncologist and get second opinion.   ",
