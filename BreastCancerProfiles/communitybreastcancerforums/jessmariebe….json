I'm so curious to find women that this A/A combo is working for....",

Thank you so much!!  Hi All, I just had the angiogram to prepare for the Y90 radioembolization procedure. I had false \"good news\" on my CT scans from treatment with Abraxane but the angiogram actually revealed a different picture. More tumors than thought which puts me at higher risk for losing liver functions after the Y90 procedure. MO is saying to switch to Carbo/Gemzar combo for one month then do the procedure. The Abraxane (in combo with a fasting protocol I have been following from Dr. Valter Longo, he got a huge NCI grant to study fasting and chemotherapy, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22323820) was working great on the bones and even the liver (even though the angio showed many more liver tumors, they did look like they were dying). I'm hoping the cargo/gem combo will knock them out of the park. It seems that many liver mets ladies have had great success with this combo for getting rid of the liver tumors with this chemo regimen.  Anyone else have this treatment?? Connis, I hope you are recovered from the biopsy, I was just sore for a few days then was right back at 'em. I even had to repeat the liver biopsy (went for a second opinion at MD Anderson and they wanted to repeat in house). It will give you good information to get started and get rid of those tumors!!! Wishing you success in your treatment.",

He is now 3.5, my oldest, my daughter is 5.5. I was diagnosed Stage IV, liver and bones one year after being NED from the first treatment. This is incredibly difficult with young children because they don't care if you don't feel good. I do my best to keep things status quo for them. I save my energy for them and take lots of rests when they aren't around. They can't really express their feelings or understand what I am going through very well but I don't hide anything from them. My daughter constantly wants to touch my port in my arm and see if it is OK, she wants to know when it will be gone! I told her it is a very good thing for mommy because it makes it easy for me to get my special medicine at the doctor and I like it. The youngest has been dealing with this since he was in utero and doesn't know Mommy as any different. He was diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy at one year old (I can't blame the chemo in my 3rd trimester or even go there) but it makes things especially difficult managing my treatment and all of his therapies. I do my best. I will keep fighting so I can be here for them!!! They are the fuel to my fire. ",
