My chemo was supposed to start last Tuesday, but the NP was concerned about a 2-inch area of my ab incision, so a week of antibiotics later, yesterday was my first day. I have to tell you, I feared chemo more than my surgery. Still do. My regimen is adriamycin and cytoxan every other week for 8 weeks, then paclitaxel every week for 12 weeks. I'd love to hear from anyone on the same regimen, but I know all of your experiences will be a huge help. Dawn Lee ",
