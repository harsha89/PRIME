Im 52 years old and have a 19 year old and a 16 year old. I'm trying to figure out how and when to tell them. Waiting to have MRI and see where things really are at. Size us 1.4cm so I hear that's small. Log in to post a reply",

So we've seen the oncologist and I will have chemo every 3 weeks for 6 months and then radiation.  My main concern right now is the swelling under my arm where they took the lymph nodes out.  If it's not better by tomorrow I'll go in and have them look at it.  I had the drains out last week.  I'm 10 days out from surgery.  Then I need to get a Pet scan and a port put in.  Thanks for listening!!",
