    "Content": "ordinarymammal wrote: I'm 8 days out from taxotere/cytoxan #2.  Starting Day #3, I am feeling spacy and unreal and high.  My BP is still my normal  (a touch high).  Heart rate fine.  I'm sleeping about 9 hours a day.  I eat well.  I am not retaining fluid.  No temp.  No drugs except prilosec and tums, which  started 2 days ago.  My chemo nurse says this is chemo brain, but I'm not sure. I believe I was having chemo brain the first round.  Terrible word finding problems, short term memory problems, easily distractable, lack of concentration.  But I felt like myself.  Now I have all that, but I also feel like an alien. Has anyone else had this happen--for days on end?  Is this really what folks are calling chemo brain? And more important, did it go away!? I am acutely miserable.  I never realized how much I loved \"reality.\"   It is really impacting my life--driving on city streets seems \"too fast and busy,\" grocery shopping is bewildering, can't even follow a full episode of a tv show.  Typing this post feels impossible.  I'm wondering if I'm even making sense. Would love to hear any one else's experience with this... Thanks Dx 4/23/2010, IDC, <1cm, Stage IB, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
