She wants to be there, but that is the same hospital she where she watched her grandfather die. I am nervous about her getting emotional there. WWYD? Could also use some prayers. It is hard keeping up a brave front for her when inside I am shaking.",

      "Content": "LisaDVM wrote: Hey - Was wondering if anyone can help me sort this out. I had a baseline mamogram done when I was 40. It showed 2 small masses in my left breast and 3 in my right. Went for ultra sound and the radiologist and surgeon agreed at the time that 4 of the masses looked like fibroadenomas and one on the left breast looked like a complex cyst. recommendation was to mammogram and us sound them every 6 months for 2 years. fast forward 2 years. I am on the last us and mammogram. Everything has been stable so far. On this last mammo I knew something was off as they did 6 additional views of left breast. Then they us. Radiologist comes in and said that complex cyst seemed a little more prominant, but had not changed in size much beyond what could be explained thru error, and wants me to start the every 6 months for 2 years cycle over again. OK nothing to worry about.  Go see surgeon. She starts doing her own u/s. I question this as this is not the norm. She says cyst has changed from a regular to irregular shape and she was trying to see if she could locate it. It has not grown but the shape has her concerned. She says she wants to take it out, but it is deep, and if she could not locate it she would have to have radiologist place wire. She said in the past they have talked patients out of biopsy for small lesions such as mine and she does not want them to do that with me. So would you follow radiologist or breast surgeons recomendations? Have any of you had a cyst change shape before? Should I be worried? Log in to post a reply",

I am tired of watch and see. I am also the sigle mother of a 13 year old whose father left never to be seen again when the baby was under 1 year. AS my sister told me I owe it to my daughter to get this taken care of ASAP since I am the only parent my girl has. Has anyone heard of a complex cyst changing shape and still be b9?",

After I woke up I asked surgeon how t ooked. She said she sent it in for pathology, but it looked b9. So would you stop worrying at this point? Surgeons see a lot of lumps and they can probably tell b9 by looking right? My surgeon sees me on Friday and she will not give results until then. I just want the worry to end.
