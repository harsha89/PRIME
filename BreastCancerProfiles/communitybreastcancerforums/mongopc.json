Throughout the day I think of you. I see your smile, hear your voice and in my thoughts you lovingly appear. The way we love each other makes it hard to be apart so when I can't hold you in my arms,I hold you in my heart.",

I come to the site everyday to read and learn. Chucks strong ability to deal with the situation is matched by Diane, and has been an inspiration to us all. They have both been dear friends to me for a long time and I feel compelled to say that, Chuck has put his own health issues on the backburner. Nearly a year and half ago Chuck had an initial Health Diagnosis that was not very good. We have only discussed this issue in breif since then. Some of you may know this and some may not. Chuck is a very giving person and Diane has loved him tremendously. Chuck was scheduled to donate a Kidney when his health issues were first discovered. I just hope things are okay with his health. We all love and Admire both of you Chuck & Diane.  The recent storm has devistated our local community and the Snipes nearby town of Chehalis. I hope to get see you soon Chuck, All my love and Respect, Mongo!",
