I am going to have a biopsy in the morning for Breast calcifications in my left Breast. The Radiologist was really no help. He made it seemed as though i had cancer. As he looked at my altrasound, He keep makeing sounds like, Hmmmmm.OHhhhh Hmmmmm. I hear this and Paniced... He said so tell me about your mom's Ovarien ( can't spell that) cancer.. and did she have the cancer gen test. I answered no she didn't and he said why!!! I said i don't know.. Shes gone now and i can't answer that. Do I have Cancer???? He said Did I say That!!!!!      What an ass i thought.. and still do.. I called the imaging center where the ultasound was done to find out more info and complain about his bedside mannor. She agreed that he is stright forward.. No harm intended.. And he is the Best Radiologest with more than 20 years experiance. I am wondering if anyone can tell me if catagory 4B means its likely cancer or more likely not.. I am so scared and worried.. I have almost convinced myself of the worst out come. Soooo Sorry about my spelling an all this.. My head has been over whelmed with worry these days.",
