Can anyone tell me that what is the proper procedure for one like me?   I've diagnosed with DCIU (stage 0 grade II) after my biopsy done last week.   My family doctor refer me to a specialist (general surgeon).  On the 1st visit to this specialist office, she asked me what do I prefer to do for surgery.  Without details of my diagnosed report, without explanation of what I have, how can she ask me this question???  I kept asking her question and keep looking for information and browse around all the web,  then I start to know what my situation is. ",
