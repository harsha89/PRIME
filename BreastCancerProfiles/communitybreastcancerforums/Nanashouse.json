I have a had a great attitude but today I am feeling a little depressed. So far I have only been able to eat raw carrots with out making me nauseous. Any suggestions to this? I am very week in the legs. I am trying to work around the house with breaks but my husband is pushing to go for walks, I know I need to, but I don't feel like I can. How long will the weekness last?? Some good things I have found out about by chance. When they are pushing \"red devil\", chew on ice to keep mouth cold to prevent mouth sores. Also I read somewhere to paint your nails black to keep the sun from harming you nails even more. Log in to post a reply",
