After first chemo I ended up in the hospital with low white cell count. It was bad because bacteria got in my blood and I guess I was actually sepsis. So they started giving me the neulasta shot after my second chemo. It did its job and I was lucky and didn't get the severe bone pain etc. But one week out from the shot I had a day well I felt loopy and light headed and dizzy. I thought maybe I had a reaction to the Claritin. Next day I was better and I didn't take any Claritin. Now I have had chemo 3 and the neulasta shot. I'm a week out again from the shot when its supposed to kick in and this am I had a racing heart for several hours. it finally stopped but of course I was freaked out and checked with the dr. If it comes back and doesn't go away then its another trip to the er or possibly to the cardiologist next week if this is frequent. My heart has stopped racing but im sort or getting that dizzy loopy feeling again. I've taken no Claritin or other drugs and beginning to feel that this is a neulasta reaction a week out? Anyone experience anything like this? Onc on call wasn't very helpful.",

Stage IIA IDC grade 3 Estrogen+/Progesteron- HER+ They got clear margins on the lumpectomy and no other areas in either breasts detected on the MRI and my lymph nodes are hegative but due to the nature of IDC and having HER2+ they are doing a strong chemo regime. Starts with Herceptin and then its the chemo drugs taxotere and carboplatin. Six rounds of this every 3 weeks. After that 5 weeks of radiation and then another 9 months of Herceptin every 3 weeks and taking the drug tamoxifin to get rid of estrogen. First chemo went fine and I'm in good health going in to this at age 61. I have a very good network of friends and am prepared for the good the bad and the ugly as far as side effects go. Will keep posting as this continues. I am a positive person and trying to stay ahead of all the problems and highs and lows before they happen. This sounded like a good group to join since we are all starting chemo at the same time. I wish you all well and positive healing thoughts. WE CAN BEAT THIS SHIT!!!",
