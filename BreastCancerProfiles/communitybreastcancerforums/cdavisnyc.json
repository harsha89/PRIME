Everything has been covered so far, so it hasn't occurred to me. Thanks for pointing that out. Seems so obvious in hindsight, yet I missed it. Thank you again.  I do have reasons for wanting the Oncotype score. My mother did chemo first, to shrink the tumor before surgery. But the pathology report showed only a 30% reduction in size (and a Ki67 score of 66% WTF). If she had the predictive info first, she may have made different decisions, or perhaps she may have had different expectations. Right now she feels angry and betrayed and depressed. She had to go back for lumpectomy re-do because of postive margins. She read her pathology report and zoned in on \"moderate response to treatment.\"  Moderate tells us not much at all. But she is very upset because she misunderstands. She sufffers from a lack of knowledge. I have decided that I will not.  For me personally, I love having as much data as possible. Why not do the genome typing on the biopsy sample? Why wait for surgery? Like you said, it gives you time to get your head around it. Make a plan. Prepare. And if your tumor doesn't react well to chemo, there's no reason to do it. And there is no reason to go through 4 dose-dense A/C treatments and THEN re-scan for response (yes, that was mom again). She was told the tumor was gone! They would perform a \"ghostectomy\" instead of lumpectomy. After I read the pathology report, that was simply untrue. I think the odds are in my favor, but I am preparing for the next step if the biopsy comes back positive. I have been watching my mother so closely that I can't help but imagine myself in the same situation. And she may very well have gone through all that suffering for nothing. Just because her tumor wasn't genome-typed. And we didn't know enough to ask. And we still don't have that information. And that's partially my fault. She starts radiation in three weeks.  Everyone's journey is different. But her journey informs mine simply because I have a front row seat. And, I am still trying to help her on her journey. Which is a WHOLE OTHER POST. And it will involve lots of wine. And whine. And then some more wine. Thank you so much for your input. It helps me a lot! Keep it coming.  -Colleen",

That's no help at all. - I am 43 years old, pre-menopausal, with dense breasts, so given my mother's condition, mammograms and ultrasounds are almost guaranteed to lead me to a biopsy and nothing but a biopsy will give me actual useful data. -my mass is between 1.5cm-2cm, lobular, with defined edges, but they can't see into it.

Then, that number gets jacked up due to my mother's status, then back down due to my age and dense breast tissue, and I think I'm back where I started.  Can anyone give me a better insight? At least until I get the biopsy report on Monday or Tuesday? I'm trying to stay objective and I love data. Oh, and if I have cancer, what should I be sure to do now with the biopsy sample to get the genome typing? Oncotype vs. Mammoprint?  Where am I right, and is there a point where I am completely off-base? Thanks for any help you can offer, -Colleen. Log in to post a reply",

I flip out when I'm looking at a needle, but waiting for results just makes me feel annoyed. Rest assured, I am passing the time with activities other than obsessively researching breast cancer.  Today is treadmill day (but with a fresh biopsy site, I'm just walking. No running!) I have work tonight, then a weekend of cooking and reading a good book and maybe Minecraft. That game is a time-suck. I refuse to do housework this weekend. Nope. Not gonna.  I've been with my mother through her treatment for breast cancer (she is having her lumpectomy re-do today -positive margins, gah), so I already know A LOT about chemo and surgery and Oncotype/Mammaprint scores and reading pathology reports. In three weeks, I will know a lot about radiation treatments too. I think 20% is as accurate as I can get right now. Darn dense breasts. I'm assuming I don't have cancer, but if I do, I know from experience how important it is to have all the information you can get.  My mother did chemo first, surgery second. If I have to start making decisions, I would want that Oncotype info first, before any treatment starts. I know they usually do it after surgery, but I would imagine it could be typed from the biopsy sample. I'll find out. Thanks for your input and info! -Colleen",

I would have to research the best kind of tea to drink first. lol. I don't disagree with anything either of you have said. And I will re-read it a few times whenever I need a reminder. The info you provided on typing a biopsy sample is especially helpful. I didn't understand why it wasn't more commonly done, and you have answered that question so very well. Also, compartmentalizing is excellent advice. I needed to hear that. I'm usually very good at that, but for some reason, I lose that ability when I'm dealing with Mom. As for Mom, she heard her surgeon say that his goal was \"complete pathological response\" and hung on to that. I knew it was unlikely and I wasn't surprised. I was a little surprised at the positive margins, but mostly because I felt her frustration. I know there are always surprises in the journey, and every journey is different. I just get so frustrated watching her, and I can't help. I try to get her in a positive mindset, and also prepare her for things like that, but she doesn't listen to me much. There's that frustration again. Mothers. What can you do? To conclude, if my biopsy comes back positive, then please join me on the next discussion board! And even if it comes back negative, I suspect there will be more biopsies in my future. This discussion has helped me greatly to keep it all in perspective. I am grateful for that. I will post my results, hopefully tomorrow! Thank you all so very much. You have my admiration and respect. I don't want to join your club, but if I ever do, I will be in excellent company. -Colleen",

They are very interesting people. -oh, and Xanax. After one of those, I change from being speechless to being able to have a conversation. I am happy to report that it didn't hurt at all (I always think they are lying when they say it won't hurt), and it went very quickly. I feel proud of myself that I managed the anxiety. I went right back to work. I've been taking Tylenol, but it's been 9 hours now, and I don't feel any pain at the biopsy site. I think the biggest pain is going to be peeling the medical tape off. That, and I'm restricted to sponge baths for a few days while it's HOT in NYC.  I hope this helps anyone who is anticipating their appointment. I think I'll zip over to the Waiting for Results forum.
