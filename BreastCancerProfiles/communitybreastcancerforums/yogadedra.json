Â Â  Not hungry so sipping on broth and listening to my body. Â Nauseous so taking zofran ATC to help c that. Â  So thankful for this group!",

I think all women going through this should have daily massage therapy to relieve the tension in neck and shoulders... I get so tense.....thank goodness my hubby is doing but seriously massage therapy after post op SHOULD be in the treatment plan... I alternate between my recliner and my bed with wedge I fashioned in it and that works nicely..... ",

I get them out monday thank GOD.....  Gabby ugh so sorry about the drain I know how annoying they are! I am able to wear a stretch tank top now and I fashioned out of string spenders over the tank straps to hold my drain bags :-) Incision burning is getting much better thank GOD....Nothing Tylenol can't remedy!

My left pec muscle is being a brat and hasn't relaxed like the right to allow the implant to drop. After each fill I get lots of pressure up by my clavicles! I am holding the implant high but the plastic surgeon says everything will relax eventually! :-) I am keeping my skin all across my chest very hydrated with coconut oil so it will stretch nicely to accommodate the expansion process. One thing I WISH I would have been educated on was lymphatic breast massage to promote drainage and reduce edema! I watched a you tube video on it and ever since I started doing the massages several times a day it has wiped out the edema and I literally feel my body draining from my breast to armpit to neck!",
