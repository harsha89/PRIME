    "Content": "robinp23 wrote: I am 7 weeks post mastectomy with reconstruction (expander). I haven't been able to start expansion yet because I'm healing very slowly. I developed a spot below the incision that evidently didn't get enough blood and formed a scab that won't heal. So my plastic surgeon wants to cut out the area and once it heals we can go ahead with expansion. My question is has anyone had this procedure (excision) done and how bad was it? It's going to be done in the office under local anesthetic.Â  Thanks for your help! Log in to post a reply",
