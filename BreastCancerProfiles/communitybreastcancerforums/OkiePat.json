I do not wear them at night.  I sleep with a pillow so my arm and hand is resting hopefully to keep swelling down at night. I thought that I would wear the glove till it starts to bother me and take it off for a while.  I understand totally about nothing being normal again.  I started this complete journey 2 1/2 years ago and I have not had normal since.  I take one day at a time and look forward for the next day. Thanks again. Pat",

      "Content": "OkiePat wrote: I don't know how concerned I should be. I have had two wasp/hornet (not sure which) stings on my right side. This is my main surgery side with 17 nodes removed. It stung me on the side of my head right above my ear toward the back and also stung me on the neck about middle of the leader that goes to the base of your neck. The one on my neck is pretty sore and I'm thinking because of it being on the leader. I panic when anything happens on that side because of lymphedema. I have been so careful so far and now this. I washed the area with anitbactiral soap and then put hydrocordizone on it. Then after the pain slowed down I took a shower and put some solarcaine on it. I have never been alergic to insect bites so I'm not really worried about that. Sorry to be so long, but I am concerned that it being on the same side and close to where the nodes were taken. I know there are some in my neck as well, but will they take care of the venom that the little devil decided I needed. Log in to post a reply",
