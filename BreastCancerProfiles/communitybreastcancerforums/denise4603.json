May lose my tissue expander depending on how bad it is when he opens me up again. Best case scenario is open it up, wash it out and put in a new drain. Feels like I will never get to go back to work or start my chemo. This started when my right drain fell out all by itself over 2 weeks ago. My left drain has been in almost 8 weeks and still putting out 30-40ccs. The right side was getting fluid removed with a needle every week, but today it was red and PS's face fell when he saw it. Sounds like Monica and Vivian are having their trials as well. Sorry to hear this and hope all clear up quickly.",

Hospital stay was not fun - don't know how some of these incompetents keep their jobs. I came home Saturday evening and my husband has been waiting on me hand and foot! If I don't move at all I have no pain, but any arm or hand movement such as lifting my coffee cup, hurts A LOT.  The drains are fairly simple to take care of. Mostly I am just taking medicine, sleeping, and reading.

Two days ago I began to get swelling under my arm around the surgery site. The swelling goes down with icepacks and gets worse in the evenings after a full day of mild activity.  Is this lymphedema or normal post-surgical swelling?
