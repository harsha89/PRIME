The radiologist talked with me about getting a biopsy at the time of my testing because she wanted to make sure it was nothing. Told me not to worry, there was a 10% chance anything was bad. I have a biopsy scheduled for Nov 30 (first availability). I just received my test results online but have not spoken with my OB-Gyn dr. yet. Does anyone know what \"complex\" oval, \"complex\" cystic means? Or BI-RADS 4; Suspicious means? From the report: Right breast: Right whole breast sonography demonstrates a 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.7 cm complex oval complex cystic and solid mass in the right breast 10:00 location, 3 cm from the nipple. This is adjacent to a 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm oval anechoic cyst at the right breast 10:00 location, 2 cm from the nipple. IMPRESSION: 1. Suspicious, cystic and solid right breast mass at the 10:00 location, 3 cm from the nipple for which ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended. RECOMMENDATION: Right breast ultrasound-guided biopsy.
