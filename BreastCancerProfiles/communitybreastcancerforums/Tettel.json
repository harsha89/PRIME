I was diagnosed Sept.27th 2013 with invasive ductal carcinoma in my left breast.  stage II, grade 3, Triple negative but Her2 showed mixed results.  Part of the mass may have the Her2 receptors. Biopsy of funky looking lymph node negative. I am doing chemo first (12 of taxol & trial drug) and then A&C.  Surgery will follow.  A lumpectomy was recommended on 1st opinion.  2nd opinion laid out all options for me to decide.  Radiation will follow if I go with the lumpectomy and may follow if i have the mastectomy. I will have some node dissection regardless of choice. I have just one Taxol/trial drug infusion to go and then on to 4 infusions of A & C.  I'm thinking surgery will fall in April. I am 51, never pregnant and have a benign tumor in my right breast.   I am fearful of a reoccurrence and leaning towards double mastectomy.  I understand I can still get breast cancer and understand the statistics.  I also understand this may seem radical.  Is anyone out there facing the same decision or has made the decision either way and can provide support?   Dx 9/27/2013, IDC, Stage II, Grade 3, ER-/PR- Log in to post a reply",
