Our local ERs are not comfortable using the port for blood draws and I was really OK with that since I'm kind of protective about it so it's in tip top shape for chemo. So they needed to  use the viens in my arms.  I've been told that if they can help it I probably should limit the blood draws to my left arm because of the possibility of lymphedema. Because these blood tests originally called for two blood draws - one in either arm - they compromised and did them both in the left arm but 45 minutes apart. So there were two draws from my left arm. I'm not sure how that would have effected chemo or not if I had it the following week. I think the port/picc line is a personal decision, just wanted to give you more information.",

I too heard from my Patient Navigator that insurance companies look at different criteria/family history to decide if they will pay for any BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing. During my 1st appt with the MO we only briefly discussed genetics and testing so that is an area to revisit. My MO did, however, bring up further testing for metastasis since the stage of my cancer jumped from a clincial stage II to a stage III after the pathology reports since there were more lymph nodes involved than previously thought. So next week I am having a CT scan of my chest, abdomen and pelvis.  As much as I don't even want to think about where else the cancer might be, I'm really happy he suggested it so I don't have to wonder about every twinge or pain in my body being cancer.  I think because my original BC tumor could not be felt, even by the BS when she knew where it was, it makes me more anxious wondering about where else it might be.  I know it won't find the rogue cell wandering around, but that's what the chemo will take care of! I'm glad I could get the testing done while I'm waiting for my 9/19 appt to get cleared by the BS to start my chemo.   Thinking of you while you wait........ Pam",

It was a long appointment as it was my first with the MO so I know we didn't have a chance to discuss everything in detail.  I was so glad we were going to do any testing because the mets are what scare me most.  The MO said he did not get a clear indication of any symptoms of mets from our conversation, so one theory I have is that my symptoms did not justify a more expensive test from the start, but that's just a theory.  I have had salivary gland cancer in the past and I have a yearly chest x-ray to check for lung mets so to me a CT scan was a step up!",

Something to look forward to on chemo days - just what we all need.  Thinking ahead to chemo - I did some online shopping for head gear today (some scarves) and a friend of mine made me a knitted hat and wants to make more. Because scarves are something I haven't worn before I think it's more difficult to shop online -(I've got an idea what a shirt would look like, etc) I did also order a couple fleece hats.  Just a tip - check out the sale/clearance at places like Land's End/LLBean if looking for cheap winter hats. I found a couple for under $3.97  I'm sure part of it is that I don't want to be looking for stuff to cover my upcoming bald head - I'd prefer my own hair to be covering it  I received a letter in the mail yesterday that the Board of Education at my school has approved my medical leave of absence for \"approximately the 2013-2014 school year\".  I don't get paid after I use all my sick days, but I keep my same job so I can go back when I'm ready.  I love that it's flexible - could be until spring if all goes well after chemo and radiation but if I need the whole school year and to return next September that is an option as well. ",

When I had the appt with my MO he said as long as we start chemo within 3 months of my surgery we were good. I was concerned because we were waiting for BS to return from vacation so I could get cleared to start so it was his way of telling me there wasn't a problem with us waiting. My husband I were talking this morning and may wait 7 or 8 weeks because our insurance year starts October 1st - then we wouldn't end up with two years of catostrophic caps. If we start the second week of October, my chemo weeks would be the week BEFORE Thanksgiving and the week BEFORE Christmas so I may feel better for the holiday - maybe :-)  So much to consider. Your health, the timing, the money. Babs - I agree with the aquafor - I used it on my neck and side of my face when I had Rads for salivary gland cancer in 2009 and it helped. My step-daughter is here visiting because we had a family wedding yesterday and our niece and nephew are here from Norway as well so we are going to do some shopping this week.  Hoping that will take my mind off of getting results on Thursday. My husband was in the military and every military spouse's nightmare is seeing the dark sedan pull up in your driveway and service members in full uniform getting out of the car when your spouse is deployed. It usually means they are coming to tell you that your spouse is dead.  Many spouses will not answer the door because until they do it's not real.  I think that's how I'm feeling about my CTscan - I am usually one who wants to know but this time I can be for sure met free from now until Thursday.  I may remain that way after the results on Thursday but that's not a guarentee - not getting results is.  I know, not good logic - just a mental health break. Not that I can stop thinking about it, but I'm not in a tailspin I know I will be in if I hear the words. A lot of family at the wedding this weekend offered support, love and prayers so that was a good thing. Keep healing everyone!! ",

The lymph node dissection area is the most painful.  All the narcotics make me sick so I've been managing on Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it's tolerable.   I have an appointment with my BS on 9/19 and I will begin chemotherapy as soon as she clears me for treatment. In the meantime my MO is going to schedule some other tests. Echocariogram to make sure I can withstand chemo and CT scans to see if there are any metastasis. Keep resting and healing!!",

It's interesting that some people got instructions to shower with drains and others told to wait. Lisa, I hope your drainage amount stays low and you can get yours taken out tomorrow. I have a relative that works in MO office and she said I'd be surprised to hear some patients want to know as little as possible about what's going on. Even not wanting to know anything about their chemo or side effects. I don't think that's the case for those of us on the message boards seeking info but it would help explain why some medical professionals aren't always as forth coming with details. I know that I told both my BS and MO that I'm a person that likes a lot of information and they seemed to appreciate knowing that. The MO even noted that in the letter he sent me summarizing our appointment. I thought the letter idea was great by the way. Stay healthy and keep healing!",

I feel like every medical professional I've met so far on this journey has mentioned concern about infection so I think it must be important to be on top of it just in case. So I don't believe for a second that the Dr wishes he hadn't met you. I live in a rural area and my BS is about 70 minutes away as well.  We have two small local hospitals about 20-30 minutes away in either direction.  The Oncology nurse already told me not to let one of the hospitals/ER's touch my port.  That's not exactly a vote of confidence. Lisa - thanks for your kind words.  I was still functioning well.  It's possible that my gut instincts were just kicking in big time. (read below) Jtrosesav - Saying a prayer that you are soon planning a trip to Israel and NOT planning time in the chemo chair. Good for you scheduling a \"mandatory do nothing morning\".  It's so easy to overdo. If it was someone else we would probably be telling them to sit on the couch but we aren't very good at our own advice sometimes. My Sunday saga - I went to the ER yesterday with a temp of 103.4. The family wedding this weekend was outside, both for rehearsal on Friday and wedding on Saturday.  And Saturday it poured - so we were outside in the cold damp weather for hours.  Both nights I had the chills by the time I got home and it took some time to recover. Temp was raised a bit but then it went down. Sunday morning after church I got chilled again and it didn't seem to stop and then I got very warm. We decided to go to the ER because I too was concerned about an infection. Although there are still some cultures growing, in the meantime I have an \"unusual bladder infection\". It's unusual because there were no other symptoms beside the fever. It's the first UTI I've ever had so that wasn't what I was expecting.  However, way better than something to do with the surgery.  They did take a chest x-ray as well as a lot of blood to check it out. So I will take my Cipro for a few days on move on to the next thing. Fever is down today already. Today's saga - I was sleeping in a bit to recover from yesterday's events and the phone woke me up about 9.  A woman was calling from my gynecologist office and wanted to schedule a pelvic ultrasound.  I said \"OK, but how come?\"  She had no further information but while laughing together she and I put some pieces and dates together and decided it must be in response to my recent CT Scan. She said the Dr was not in today but she would email her to get some details and call me back.  I checked my email after the phone call and there was a message from my health chart that I had a new email.  It was actually from the Gynocologist from early this morning at 6am letting me know that they saw a small fibroid and some ovarian cysts but they were not concerned about them. However, there was a 1/2 inch of something suspicious in my right ovary. She also mentioned that I would likely be encouraged to do some genetic testing. The other interesting thing about this is that she has not been involved with this whole process so it surprised me that she would be ordering the test instead of the oncologist. I like her a lot so it's fine with me that she's involved - just interesting.  I was able to schedule the pelvic ultrasound for this thursday after my post-op appt with my BS.  It's just in the next building over so it's very convenient - they use the same parking lot.",

I was excited to find out there were no other signs of cancer in my CT Scan.  My MO said he wasn't concerned about the area in my ovary that the Radiologist was concerned about so I've let go of some of that anxiety too but will get rid of the rest of it after I hear the results of the pelvic ultrasound.  That was a huge relief.  There were a few other things that showed up on the CTScan not related to the cancer (ie a small kidney stone, disc and spine issues, etc) and typically they might be things to be concerned about but in light of breast cancer it seems like no big deal. Just things to keep an eye on - I'm not going to look for trouble. It's amazing how BC can change your perspective. BS thought everything looked good, officially released me for chemo, sent a referral to PT and I won't see her again until I get my port out in the spring.",

One is about Fighting Cancer and the other about Chemo both by Belleruth Naparstek. I have to admit I haven't used the cancer one as often but it's because I've felt less anxious.  But I do plan to start the chemo one shortly to get ready.  I'm thinking it might help that first day go better.

I get very sick when I take narcotics so I told the BS I didn't need a prescription but she winced and said but it's going to hurt, etc so I took it just in case. I didn't actually take any - just used OTC Tylenol and Ibuprofen as it was tolerable and now I'm not taking any so there is progress for sure. I had my port placed during my original surgery since the Radiologist had done a biopsy on one of my lymph nodes and we already knew it was cancerous and chemo would be in my future. My BS didn't suggest it, I called and asked if it was possible.  I hadn't met with my MO (medical oncologist) yet and he was away at a conference but my BS (breast surgeon) checked with other medical oncologists at a patient care conference and they all agreed I would be having chemo so it was OK to proceed.  I was really grateful she went the extra mile to check it out as it saved me another procedure time.  It sounds like you have a great medical team as well - I think it's so important!  Hopefour - thanks for the prayers, they are always appreciated.",

The Radiologist thought I had two smaller tumors that were connected but the Pathologist decided it was all one. They had confirmation from a biopsy that 1 lymph node had cancer in it but two others were suspicious. It turned out that 5 were cancerous. The Radiologist and BS did both tell me that the pathology report would be most accurate. My MO told me that because I moved up to a Stage III I was eligible for further testing to see if there is any metastatic disease other than my lymph nodes. Since this has been a big concern of mine, I am glad I will have the opportunity to check. I have a CTscan tomorrow. Breast Cancer is not the time to listen to those messages we received during our younger years to strive for higher grades! I have the test tomorrow but next MO appt is 9/19, it will be interesting to see if he calls with results before then.",

With my MO's approval I had mine removed 3 weeks PFC (almost a week ago) because my RO was gently suggesting that it would be easier to do rads without it as the port is on the same side as the rads will be.  My MO said we didn't need it anymore so I went ahead with the removal. My RO did want the removal to be at least 3 weeks before the start of my rads so the incision would be healed. I do know that when some women have had chemo first their MO's have wanted to wait until after surgery to remove the port in case they found out additional information during surgery that may have indicated further chemo.",

He was great about accomodating my wish to wait a little bit to start rads because I'm anxious about driving an hour and 10 minutes each way in winter weather. I still have one more chemo scheduled for this week - I'm hoping it still happens as I'm dealing with a UTI this week. My simulation is scheduled for the last week of February and then I'll start rads the first or second week of March.  I did have some radiation back in 2009 in my salivary gland region and I'm returning to the same RO because I thought the team was wonderful - they still are!  When he went over some side effects he would say this or that could happen and if it does \"we'll get you through it\".  He used that phrase a few times and it was so genuine and comforting.  And from what I remember that is exactly how it happened last time, he and the team were very responsive to my needs. ",
