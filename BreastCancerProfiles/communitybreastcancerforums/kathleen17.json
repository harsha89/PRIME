      "Content": "Jul 16, 2010 01:14AM - edited Jul 29, 2010 02:15PM by kathleen17 I'm starting chemo for the first time on Aug. 4. I was diagnosed Jan. 22 and started an anti hormone therapy, had a hysterectomy in April and 2 weeks ago had a double mastectomy (drain are still in.) Still had 4 lymph nodes positive.  Just yesterday was told I'll be taking chemo every 3 weeks for 12 weeks and then every week for another 12 weeks.  Seems like a lot of chemo.  Starting to get nervous, I have 2 boys ages 11 and 13.  We are an extremely active family, playing a lot of sports.  I'm hoping to breeze through the next 6 months. ",

Temp in St. Louis was 104 today, too hot for a wig!  I think I'll stick to scarves and hats. Worried about side effects but ready to get things going.  My drains are finally out and my arms are getting stronger each day.  Thanks for all the positive comments.  Good luck ladies!",
