I had my last chemo/Taxol at the end of July, and my head looks almost exactly like your photo. It's covered with white/grey hair, but is still so short, darn it. I measure it fairly often, and its a bit over 1 3/4 inches at its longest. I'm so impatient for it to be long enough to use a curling iron or flat iron on. Do you think you'll color your hair?",
