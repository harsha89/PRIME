Brca neg. spent a year of worry w various tests etc. finally had prophylactic bilateral mastectomies / sentinel nodes removed. (Day after Mother's Day.) Three Drs were fully in favor. I could not be happier. Brought my risk down to zero. I was afraid that the pathology from mastectomies would show cancer but it didn't. Feel like I dodged a bullet. And though some may say I was too drastic I say look at what others are dealing with. There is nothing better than losing that worry I didn't do reconstruction so my recovery was a breeze. Wishing you all the best",
