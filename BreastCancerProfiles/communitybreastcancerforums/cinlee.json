Thank god for that, food isn't tasting so good, no appetite, drinking water, gatorade, (which I don't like) and slimfast shakes for the proteins, did enjoy my Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia very much yesterday.  Sleeping better and still have energy during the day, took grampa to church yesterday as usual, puttered around the yard a bit as the weather here in Upstate NY is finally getting better, in the 60's yesterday and sunny and fresh air was soooo nice.  Oh yea, I ordered 2 wigs from Paula Young and 2 scarves this weekend.  Not sure how I feel about that yet.  Hope they look ok.  Well guess I better finish getting ready for work.  Usually work 8:30 til 7 on Monday, hope I can get through the whole day but not going to feel bad if I can't.  Bonbon and Thai my thoughts are with you today.  Take care everyone, if it seems I'm leaving anyone out please forgive me I don't mean to, probably the most frustrating side effect so far for me is forgetfullness and inability to focus.  Love you all, we'll beat this thing together.  Keep positive.

I set up my next appt. for tx#2 which is the day after yours and my first thought was, do we have to wait can't we just do it this Friday and get it done with?  Fortunately my counts were good and my sore throat and fever symptoms are much much better so it isn't going to effect next tx.  Going to stay with my daughter and grand daughter tonight for a girls night pajama party thing just the 3 of us.  I can't emphasize enough....thank god for kids and grandkids.  Keeping everyone in my prayers we'll get through this.

Happy Birthday today jas and Happy Birthday weekend NancyD.

I got virus over the last couple of days and spent the evening in emergency...also having blood in my stools.  No blood in my stomach so now they want stool samples, (not sure why they didn't do that at the hospital last night), went for my 10 day checkup today with chemo onc.  He feels that it is virus related and not  from chemo becomes blood counts are not bad.  That's a relief but still concerned what's causing the black stools.  Sore throat really making it difficult to sleep and needless to say I'm exhausted.  Otter I'm a day behind you and I'm constantly checking to see if my hair is falling out yet.  No signs yet.  Good luck with the color choice.  Thinking of everyone.  God bless and good night.",

Tomatojuice sorry to hear you had such a difficult time with the port, I will be thinking of you today along with everyone else. Anyone heard from swimangel72 whether she's going to be able to get her tx today? As alway's I'll be thinking of everyone and saying a prayer for all of us.  I go Friday 4/25 and can't wait to get another one done and over with.  I think I'm more prepared for the s/e this time. Cindy",
