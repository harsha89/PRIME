    "Content": "cindysped wrote: I went for my diagnostic mammogram and they did a complete set of everything since I had no prior mammograms.  They also did an ultrasound of both breast. The \"lump\" I was feeling that started this whole process did not even show up on the mammogram or ultrasound and the tech told me that it is just a piece of tissue that was not even a lump.  (Yea). They did find some very small cysts on my left breast and a couple on my right with some very small calcifications. The doctor said \"You are Fine\" Music to my ears. I do go back in 6 months for a another mammogram to make sure nothing changes but they said this is routine since this was my first mammogram.  The tech told me that my cyst were very very tiny....about the size of a penhead as were the calcifications. Breast looked good with no fibrocystic lumps etc.....I was told by my doctor when I was 30 that I had lumpy breast due to fibrocystic changes but the tech said no way....Anyway.....Thanking God and you guys for your support....I plan to follow the forum still and always get a doctor to check your 'lumps\"....
