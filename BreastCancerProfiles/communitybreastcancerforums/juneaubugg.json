I didn't get my first trim until about 24 weeks. I get my third Friday. We trim from around the ears and below. Just letting the rest fill in and grow out. Filling in takes time, but no I didn't touch the top whilst it did/does. Hang in there... The hair loss was the most demoralizing part for me. I felt striped bare before the world. When I finally said F-it and just took the cap off I got my self confidence back. Now I ware a cap because my head gets so cold, but I leave a little hair sticking out in Front. It's like in need to be sure people know I'm not bald... Funny thing is; who would actually THINK THAT?! \"Oh I bet she's bald under there\". Lol! Chemo really does drive you CRAZY!

Per my beautiful necklace. My DH picked put for me at my friends Aunts shop when we visited his inlaws this summer when I was just a week out of my 3rd AC. it was. A tough trip for me. Anyway, if you're ever in Wilmington NC, it's a small shopping the Cotton Exchange in downtown. It's the last shop downstairs on the left when you enter the marketplace. They have beautiful jewelry. And this piece was inexpensive too. Only $60. If you're ever near its worth stopping in.",

I use MOP C-System Curl Enhancing Cream to keep the curls from being unruly while it grows in. It seems to be starting to straighten now near my scalp. My hairdresser told me last week to just keep waiting it out. She trimmed me up and evened me off about 6 months out. I agree with everyone else - take photos so you can see the progress. Otherwise it just seems like it's never going to come back. I look at Carols photos and get hope. It's grown so much since last year! Although my hair was always a bit slow to grow.... *sigh*",

I also thought about ALL those things. its totally normal. this is a JOURNEY NOT AN EVENT. you will not get one answer, one treatment, and be done. there are tests, surgery, more tests, maybe chemo... maybe radiation... usually hormone therapy.... we are all different and our journeys are all little different. I remember when I got my diagnosis I landed her at the BCO website... THANK GOD. its all I've ever needed. stay away from Dr google and statistics.... WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. I remember having the abbreviation page book marked at first so I could understand things. I remember checking to see if there were any responses to my posts every fifteen minutes. I was like someone who just crossed the desert, and information/responses were like water to me... and I was desperate. WE ALL GET IT, AND YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. Find a forum or two on here and call it home. take the journey with other newly diagnosed women and find one where women can tell you what worked for them. you will have choices all along the way, you don't need to decide right now about recon or not. your BS (breast surgeon) and, if you see one... your choice, PS (plastic surgeon) will be able to help you decide what surgery is right for you (i was able to have a skin and nipple sparing mastectomy with reconstruction...i didn't know such surgical options were available until after my consult. i thought it was lumpectomy or mastectomy; so just wait) and if there is a reconstruction method you would like to have... or not. if not, they can steer you to specialty bra shops to aid you in prosthetics and they have bras that hold them. (do keep in mind you will need specialty bathing suits too). there will be so much you will learn, and I would suggest you get that education here. add you get more information from your drs come here and ask questions, read forums, learn from others who have the experience. I got all my questions to ask my drs here. they were always surprised by hours much I knew to ask about. and most importantly, this place was my lifeline. my drs gave me ativan and xanax for the anxiety, I took pain meds for the surgeries and yes, the biopsies fucking hurt... but the emotional isolation, not being able to explain to family and friends, in any way they could really understand, how it felt to be me... I found relief from that here. so I'm SO SORRY you have landed here, but you ate so lucky you found us. welcome... and hold on its going to be a bumpy ride... BUT YOU WILL SURVIVE, and perhaps welcome someone who is scared, confused and looking for answers a year from now. I like what Golden said too.... keep breathing. most days it really is that simple. feel free to PM (private message) me if you'd like, or have more questions. I may have answers, I may not, but I'll try... (((hugs)))",
