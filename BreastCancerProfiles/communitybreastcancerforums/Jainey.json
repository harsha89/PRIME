You have to have the faith and trust in yourself - not so much for being 'strong' but just for being you and doing the best you can with all things considered for that very day ... I have felt like that many times and I just remind myself that it is a Journey and lots of learning curves and I try to enjoy each one (even if I dont) ... You are doing the right thing being here and verbalizing what it is you are going through ...

I have done so much research for prevention etc. 13 lymph nodes removed on the right and 3 on the left ... the first few months are so critical for the internal healing and then the nerve healing can take up to a year ... I agree with what Letlet has to say Plus the chemo can have a negative affect on the lymph drainage system as well. I am so annal about doing my own Lymph massage every morning and when I have my bath, plus I put Traumeel Cream on everyday, sometimes twice. I DO NOT carry grocery bags or a heavy purse or do anything weight bearing with my arms ... so far so good ... but, the healing is still taking place even though I have my full range of motion back and my arms are pretty much normal. Be super careful ... there is no revearsal on the LE from what I have read. Keep doing your homework ...",

I lean to the side of safety first, and always have ... inactivity is the worst at one end and then overexertion is the worst on the other ... my ND Onc emailed me last week to remind me it takes at least 8 weeks for the physiological healing after surgery in optimal conditions ... So, that being said ... who is in optimal conditions??? Lots to factor into the equation ... Plus .. nerves can take up to a hear to repair themselves and everything is intertwined and individual ... I asked my PS and he was so 'out to lunch' stating ... you dont have LE and you probably wont get it (it is not quite 8 weeks since my surgery) and then I shared some info regarding others who have gotten it a couple years later when flying in an airplane ... he was beside himself ... He did not believe me or was not aware ... doesnt matter, he was oblivious to what I was talking about. So, we cannot assume that our PS or BS is educated in this area. Plus, my PS does lots plastic surgery outside of BMX etc with respect to cancer ... So, he is specialized in the reconstruction, and I must remember this. That is why it is So VERY critical that we have these sites and threads ... I am spinning my head here .. but, doing all the grinding research so that I do not have to learn by trial and error ... Oh, Ladies ... Thank you so much for the websites and personal writings ... Prayers to us all ...",

You have done so well ... thank you for your input and sharing ... again, we are so very individual (diet, medical conditions, medications, hydration, age, and more) are all what makes us so individual ... PLUS ... knowing our bodies-being connected and being aware of immediate and small changes/reactions-Thank you for sharing. I am only 8 weeks post surgery ... still in the healing process and getting more frustrated each day for having to be 'less active' (not even driving my truck yet) ... but, in the end it will be have some postive effect. You have seem to beat many odds:-) Kira - Thanks for the websites and info, it so helps to keep reading from good sources. Lago - Thank you too for helping me with my confusion ... I so want to trust, but Patient Beware is always good to keep in mind when not dealing with the Expert in each field. I will search out a specialist in my area and see what I can come up with. Cheerss! hey, the sun is finally coming out:-)",
