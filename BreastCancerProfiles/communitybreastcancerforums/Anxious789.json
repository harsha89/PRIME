I am little apprehensive for tomorrow; i had some GI issue after #5 that went away and I have excessive watery eyes - hopefully will not get worst. Becky, I'm glad your watery eyes got better, did you use any medicine? I am using Systane eye drop but its not working. Kber, I am still getting use on seeing myself bald, the weather has been cold here and I always wears a beanie 24/7. Yesterday was a little warm here, for the first time, I went bald at home...I felt weird...I want to put make up on but I can't due to my watery eyes. Angie and Nanette, hope you feel better!

I cannot sleep with Decadron, I did not sleep last night, and today, I took a nap for a few hours only and now I'm wide awake. Marriet, you're welcome. I took an antibiotic too for 7 days and use Peridex when they pulled my teeth. It is 6 hours after my infusion, so far no side effect yet except I am wide awake. I am not getting Nuelasta but instead I am getting Neuprogen, I have to go my doctor's office for the next 3 days to get the shots. I was not given any instructions on what meds to take before the shots.",

I also had a gynecologist that told me my uterus is very bad while doing uterine biopsy and turns out negative, too. So don't worry Lillian, stay positive, don't listen to this, unprofessional nurse. Hope you feel better, sending you hugs ❤️ SaraCatherine, McBaker, Flower, me too will have my 2nd infusion tomorrow.

I had my first infusion yesterday, I went faster than expected as I was very chatty and hyper due the effect of the Dexamethasone (steroid pill) that my Onco prescribe me to take day before the infusion. Some people get the Dexamethasone via IV. The anticipation is sometimes worst than the actual infusion, I even brought my anti-anxiety pill just incase I panic before or during the infusion, but thanks GOD I didn't need it. Today, day two, so far no SE, no nausea or anything yet (I hope I am not speaking too soon). After infusion last night, I ate a very light dinner, it probably helped in preventing nausea and stomach upset. Today I am planning to eat oatmeal hoping that it will prevent constipation.

Everything went okay except I had I had to deal with the incompetence and lack of responsibility of my doctor's office. I had to deal myself with their corporate office to get the Neupogen shot. They have 3 weeks to make sure all they have all the meds but they didn't and they don't care if I got the shot or not. Good thing they just joined cancer network that knows responsibility and liability. At the beginning of my second infusion, i felt lightheaded and dizzy and I noticed the drip is going too fast so I told the nurse to change it to slow drip. So if you feel something different right away during the infusion it might be the drip. It's better to start with a slow drip. I had the same SE as last time, red face.. feeling sick... tired.. lazy... I had to force myself to get up and to walk yesterday. I had no pain, no nausea... Today is day 4 after my second infusion, I feel better than yesterday. My worst days is the 3rd day after infusion. Constipation... take care of it before it gets worst. Eat lots of fiber before during and after infusion. I usually eat oatmeal for breakfast and take Metamucil and stool softener (Dulcolax) the day after infusion and I will have bowel movement by the 3rd day. For those ladies asking about the cumulative effect, I had the same questions before... I friend of of mine said the 1st is the hardest but somebody told me the 3rd is the hardest. I guess our body reacts to it differently. I am hoping the first one is the worst.",

I was in there for 35 minutes, I didn\u2019t sweat as much as I want to and I came out feeling exhausted. My arms and legs are still sore and weak but my watery eyes are improving. I saw my Onco today and I will be starting Tamoxifen tomorrow. After all the possible side effects he told me, I\u2019m not looking forward to it. I lost half of my eyebrows and my bottom eyelashes. I don\u2019t see any fuzz on my head yet but I feel some velcro when I touch my head. Take care everyone",
