    "Content": "letty68 wrote: Hi I recently had an ultrasound done with findings of irregular hypoechoic mass birads 4 in left breast earlier this month. Was set up for an ultrasound needle guided biopsy this past Friday but was told by the specialist not to go thru with it she decided to perform a lumpectomy instead. I'm due for surgery on August 9th but I just found a dark red spot near my armpit. I have breasts and sometimes develop minor rash during the summer so I thought maybe it was same rash but after a few days it's gotten worse and bigger. So I called my specialist office and was told to call them back tomorrow since I called a bit before closing time but the girl expressed concern and told me to make sure I call her if she didn't call me herself before 10 am. I'm so scared now. Could this be a sign that I might possibly have cancer? Log in to post a reply",
