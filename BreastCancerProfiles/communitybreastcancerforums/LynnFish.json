SSDI kicked in really quickly, like a month or two after applying, which was like 4 months after diagnosis. My impression is that you need to be 6 months post diagnosis to receive benefits, but there is a compassion clause that fast-tracks terminal / stage IV cases. My sister was diagnosed Stage IV the same week...yes...as I was. I was a professional/career person, she was not so much. Her hospital (Duke) said that they encourage all of their stage IV patients to apply/receive benefits. If you receive LTD from an employer, you have to apply for SSDI since they reduce your benefits by their calculation of the amount you would receive...So you're leaving money on the table, so to speak. SSDI exists for people like us. Again, no shame, we have paid in for years/decades. So there is really no question of receiving benefits if you are stage IV, the only question is re: amount, since it is a function of what you have earned.",

I asked my oncologist what that would mean for me in terms of treatment, coverage, etc., and she said that there would be no change. The 24 months works out well with most corporate employers, i.e. it aligns with the 24 months of continued medical insurance coverage while on LTD. In my individual circumstance, I had the option to get laid off, which gave me COBRA coverage just past the 24 month period. My decision came down to laying bets on whether I would die within that time period, giving my children my company life insurance benefit of 1 year's pay, vs. would I live past that time period, giving me my one year's severance. I decide that I should place my chips in the \"living\" box, not dying (!), so I took the severance and am paying COBRA until medicare kicks in...If I live until July of 2017 I made the right choice (!), we'll see! But regardless, from a karmic perspective, I think it was the right thing to do!",

I contacted attorneys to understand how it works; I spoke with friends in the insurance industry; I consulted my doctor. In the end, I went out on disability, and it was the best decision imaginable. I suppose I'm writing just to bring up the topic in case anyone else is making a similar decision. I have just a bit of info to share...For starters, with Stage IV, you pretty much automatically are \"fast-tracked\" for approval for Social Security Disability. It's related to some \"compassion clause\" since, I think, folks used to die waiting to be approved for benefit through the normal track (!). Then there's disability insurance, which is a standard benefit at most big companies. The short-term disability comes first, usually for like 26 weeks. The application was easy, i.e. most of it falls to the doctor. Then, as that is coming to an end, the long-term disability application comes. In my case (which I assume is typical), it involved a slightly longer application, with lifestyle questions (e.g. do you volunteer? what does a typical day look like?), etc. Then a phone interview that basically asks the same questions. And, again, your doctor is the key provider of information. When I applied, I kept wondering \"Am I sick enough?\". I think it's easy not to think of yourself as disabled when you can carry on many tasks of daily life. But when I thought about carrying on daily life...grocery shopping, doing things with/for my family, going to medical appointments, and the like...PLUS working 40+ hours a week, with travel, stress, conference calls, etc., I realized that there was no way I could perform at a reasonable level. So that is disabled, from an insurance perspective. It took me a little while to reconcile my mental image of \"disabled\" with my self-image, but then I realized that this is why the insurance is there. While I'm sure it's an individual circumstance, I don't think that many people with stage IV cancer truly can work demanding jobs. It's too much stress, plus one cannot predict when it will be a \"good day\" vs. a \"bad day\". And what do you do, cancel all of your meetings when a bad day comes up? That doesn't benefit anyone, and isn't good for the business. So, anyway...I'm just tossing the topic out there, in case anyone has any thoughts or questions. I do realize, by the way, that those of us with disability insurance through work are very lucky...I cannot imagine the additional stress I would feel if I were to have also lost all of my income due to this illness OR if I somehow had to try to work while going through all that this entails...

This made me not come back to breast cancer.org because I don't need the stress of haters. I will also tell you that going out on disability is the best thing I ever did. Yes, my cancer has progressed markedly...it's in virtually every bone (\"too many tumors to count\") and now in my liver but I am happy and stress free. I do believe firmly that managing the stress, e.g. . eliminating the stress from work, is beneficial to my well being. I worked in the insurance industry for two decades, so I do know what it's designed to provide, and stage IV BC is no joke. If I were working, I would be a mess. Not working...living out my remaining days with some sense of peace and happiness...is well-deserved. I bring in about 65% of prior income between LTD and Social Security, so it's manageable. I truly feel sorry for people who don't have the LTD benefits that career people have, but that shouldn't change my course. I did not mention this in my original post, but my oncologist, a woman and mom, is the one who encouraged me to go on disability. At first all my questions were around \"can I continue to work\" and she said...Don't do it. Live your life. I will be eternally grateful for her wisdom on this. It is not some undeserved hand out. It is our right to live then die in peace and happiness, to the degree possible. I will read other messages and try to reply with practical advice, which was my intention in initiating the discussion. Again, my apologies from being scared off from the site... Best, LynnFish  ",

There is a limit to how much you can earn - I think it's 20K, but please check - before your benefits are decreased. My sister, also Stage IV, was able to reduce her work schedule to 1 day per week to stay within the limit while still receiving full benefits. With insurer provided LTD there are constraints, i.e. any money that you earn through active work reduces your payment. So, for example, if you have passive income, e.g. investment or a rental property, that does not reduce the benefit. If you have a rental property, you have to be sure to classify it as \"passive\" on your tax returns, e.g. not actively managed by you, or else the income will reduce your benefit.",
