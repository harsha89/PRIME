I had the VATs with talc to help with the pleural effusion so to me thats why i have not been back to er.  When I ask about tumors or nodules he did not give me direct answers other than \"its on the out side of your lung in the pleural space\"....ask about the Androgen Receptors (AR) testing and he stuttered and said they don't do that its still new and being studied .  told him about all the side effects from the tamoxifen and mainly ask for thing to help off set them some....stomach meds, stool softners.....he was a bit smart \" if this is so bad how u going to handle chemo?\" ....informed him real quick last time chemo all most killed me but now I have to wait till Oct. 6th to do a ct scan and follow up again with him on oct. 15.........thinking maybe he is not the doctor for me.....I just want some one who will be up front and honest with me....I don't want to be flying blind.   I don't feel i was aggressive i just ask direct questions and got No real answers.  Now just lost more thanks for letting me whine...I am doing my best to put my hand in gods and let him lead me where i need to go.

I started out on July 25 taking myself to the ER because i was having a lot of problems breathing and alot of pain in my right side.  This was my local small hospital the er doc said i had PN and pleural effusion then admitted me to the floor to my PCP. They put me on antibiotics and after a lot of crying due to the pain a mild pain pill. On day 3 I found out i did not have PN I had a collapsed lung on the rt side my pcp wanted me to see the lung doc but it seems he was on Vacation. So instead of sending me out he continued to keep me and changed antibiotics even tho he himself admitted i needed drained.  On the eight day i ask to have another doc and to be transferred out. They sent me out to Central Baptist in Lexington and within less than 24 hours they had put their small version of a chest tube in ..it was called a \"pig tail\" ..they pulled off 1.5 liters of fluid total but after the first day i was feeling good....they had a ca doc come see me who told me he was a bit worried about the ct scan but after all the labs and stuff came back he said no ca but the surgeon said the antibiotics could mask infections ..I ask then \" would they mask ca? and they said no\"  So I was feeling ok and they let me leave after 5 days. Was home about 6 days when i started not being able to breath good again...family and I decided to drive to central baptist in Lexington instead of local hospital after what had happen last time.  Central Baptist is about 3 hours plus from my home.  In the ER they said the fluid was worse than last time so they again placed a \"pig tail\" and talked with me about VATs with talc. They also said that since no antibiotics in my system it would be better for the test of the fluids.   They decided to go ahead with VATS with talc and the surgeon took biopsies while he was in there....the ca doc came to talk with me but i was in and out with meds but he informed me the ca was back and mets to lungs.  My world dropped I have been lost since.  My husband was with me but he bless his heart is use to me being the question and answer person with MD's ...I do know from my electronic sent lab and ct stuff that it is ER+ , and PR+ and i think her2 neg.  CT showed 2 17mm areas but that was not a final.....I go Monday to get the full story.  Since getting out of the hospital little less than 2 weeks ago all I can do is cry. He put me on Tamoxifen before leaving hospital and i have had so many SE but i am taking it. I don't know which is worse my anxiety or my depression. He even told me to file for my disability.  I am so torn over everything. Husband has been laid off for over 2 years I am the only one bring in a income my job is where our medical insurance comes from.  Just seems like too much smacking me in the face and i don't know what to do....husband seems to be in denial ...love his heart keeps telling me \" your going to be here for a long time to come\".   I don't know how long but after reading alot of the stage 4 pages i have some hope but i know i need to be prepared.  even more I smoke...i am trying so hard to quit but they smoke around me and when i get anxious i grab them.    I keep praying to god that i can deal with this that i can make the life changes i need to make but I am really scared right now.   I will ask about the Testing for Androgen receptors. Thanks and sorry I ranted on for so long",
