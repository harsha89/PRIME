Lymphedema just crept up on me and has now landed in one leg.  The last two days it looks like it may be moving into the other leg.  I've been really discouraged and depressed about this.  I'm all by myself so if I lose the use of my legs I'm toast. I do the exercises faithfully that the LPT has given me and wrap the leg the way I'm supposed to.  So many of you are doing heavy duty exercises.  Did you start where I'm at and build up to where you are now?  It's amazing that in about 6-weeks time I'm barely able to walk when I was able to take the stairs two at a time!  Is there hope for me to also build up to where you are now?  Need some encouragement!

I finally got in to  see the PT yesterday.  We did the massage and wrapping.  She taught me how to do the massage and it does make a difference.  Carol, I still swell more after I exercise.  I'm wondering if I'm just doing too much.  Now I exercise, elevate the leg afterward and massage the fluid up and out.  It is making a difference. Binney, I agree that gardening is huge when it comes to exercise.  I want to know how you're cooking your beets and cooling them for a snack.  Aren't they mushy after you cook them?  Share, share, share what you're doing with the beets!  I want to try it. I also have a friend who swears by the Epsom salt soaks for the hands and feet.  He has cured his neuropathy by soaking daily.  I'm going to give it a try today and then see if I can get the swelling down far enough so as to give myself a pedicure.  Doesn't that count as exercise?  ha ha.

Looking forward to all of us having good results with this one! Sue",

Today I can barely walk because of the shortness of breath.  Sat in the Dr.'s office yesterday and we decided my oxygen levels were at or above normal so no need to schedule the thorocentisis.  I can't believe how out of breath I am only 24 hours later!  Hope I don't end up in the ER tonight.  I'm scheduled to work on Monday so I'll have to call for the appointment on one of my breaks.  Why do these things only pop up on the weekends?  I'm wondering if the rads I had this week and last are causing the reoccurrence along with the leg swelling.  I was so hoping not to have to have this again and let the new chemo do it's thing with the lungs.  I'm bummed.  Sue  ",

Hang in there with your mom JC. These drugs can produce all kinds of weird SE's and hopefully this is just an anomaly.   I haven't started yet but other drugs I've had have bounced some of my counts up and down for no reason before they level out.  One \"bounce\" out of several doesn't mean it's not working.  Just pray that it's her body getting used to something new.

So far, I've just had the first infusion.  I've had extreme fatigue and a runny nose - go figure.  A bit of a funny stomach here and there but no real nausea.
