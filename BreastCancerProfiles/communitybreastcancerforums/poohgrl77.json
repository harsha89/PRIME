I got hold of her doctor's office this morning and they said that the report indicated an area of density on the left side so they want to take one more lateral view of the picture. The radiologist indicated that it does not appear to be suspicious... I'm hoping this will all turn out okay. Again, thanks for your replies. This has meant so much for me the last couple of days.

It was tissue that got compiled on top of each other and when they did additional imaging, it was completely gone. Again, thank you for all your kindness and I'll be praying and hoping for the best for anyone.",

The letter does not indicate any other information except that she needs to get more viewing and that this does not indicate that there is a problem. She had a similiar experience about 10 years ago when she had her first baseline mammograme at 43years old. And it turned out that it was just dense breast on her right side.  Although we have gone through similiar experience, I'm just so worried and the hospital is closed for the weekend so I can't even make the appointment.  My question is, how common is it to get an request for additional viewing for someone who's had annual mammograms in the past?  Sorry for the long post and thanks for any input anyone might have.

So, when I went to my OB for my discharge issue, they ran the blood test and it came back normal. That lump you are feeling might just be tissue but for a peace of mind, why don't you ask your PCP or OB to refer you to a breast specialist? It is probably nothing to worry about but getting that opinion will put your mind at ease. Being worried about breast issue is really no fun. I've been obsessively checking mine and it is driving me insane and I have made them all red from all the irritation...",

I too have a doctor's appointment tomorrow for a discharge issue that I've been having. This may be TMI, but what is the nature of your discharge? Mine is milky and I can express them from both side, but it's more on my left side. I've had blood work to test my proactin level and that came back normal so I am seeing a surgeon tomorrow to see what he would like to do.  My problem started when I stated doing my BSE and kept on pressing on it to see if any discharge would come out. And I've noticed that the more I poke around, the more discharge I seem to have.  Anyways, you will be in my thoughts and keep me posted on how your appt go tomorrow.",
