Keeping them cool (nothing but flip flops) along with claritin and pepcid (both antihistamines) helped some. My onc. also gave me some extra steroids for the days after. Be sure to report the rash to your onc. because there is a condition called hand and foot syndrome that sometimes occurs with taxol and taxotere.",

My boyfriend went with me to the onc. nurse practitioner chemo side effects appointment, and when she got to the \"sexual side effects\" part we asked her how long adriamycin stays in vaginal fluid, meaning, would he have any exposure during oral sex....after all that red stuff comes out in your pee afterward....she looked at us like we were from another planet....all she wanted to do was tell me not to get pregnant during chemo, duh! It's bad enough that food doesn't taste good during this ordeal, but it would be really bad if we can't enjoy sex either.",

Remember that saliva can be your best lube, and don't forget the all important foreplay, foreplay, foreplay, in the right location, location, location! Use some playtoys too, with lots of lube. ",

Pet her bald head and don't forget to touch her scar -- that is part of her too and she will know that you love all of her. My boyfriend does that every day and tells me I am under construction. He helps me to look in the mirror and see myself as beautiful with my bald head and my missing part that will not be rebuilt until the end of the year. Let her cry if she needs to -- it happens.  Oh, those viruses on top of A/C!! I had it last week, it was like chemo day squared! Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize! ",

Sick and tired of being sick and tired, I agree, and you got an extra blast of it.  Babyc, isn't it undignified as well as uncomfortable about the hair? I have eyebrows but no eyelashes, occasionally have to shave my legs, and now 5:00 shadow on my scalp. So weird. I have had thrush each round, which REALLY makes food taste bad, so yes, check your mouth for the white patches when you have a sore throat Renral.  Happy valentine's day to all of us, remember our beauty is inner beauty and we will get our \"missing parts\" back. My valentine tells me he loves me even as a bald uniboob, and I'm under construction. And all the kids in my life want to pet my bald head.  Though I did dream I had hair, long, beautiful hair, the other night....",

Yep, getting a cold on top of it is major suckage, totally trashed my second \"off\" week, come to think of it my washer broke that week too....hmmmm, is that in the prescribing information for this stuff?  Does anyone else get grossed out by the hideous candy apple red color of adriamycin? Then there is the experience of a pear not tasting like a pear....good luck to all, we are going to get through this and have glorious new heads of hair later in the year. ",

She's very interested in Taxol because they learned about cell division and microtubules in science class (7th grade) and that's how taxol works, by stabilizing microtubules.....then we were talking about tamoxifen and I said, \"the cancer I have has estrogen receptors.\" She stopped in her tracks and said \"Mom! you mean the cancer you HAD!\" Yes indeed. I tell myself each day, all this and the upcoming radiation are just a mop-up operation, a just-in-case.  Isn't it GREAT to have those moments when you DON'T think about having breast cancer, when you're just living your life, albeit at a slower pace than you normally do?  Off to A/C #4 tomorrow, it's so nice to see some of you being done with that horrible stuff, it's probably the only thing that will make tomorrow tolerable, that it's the last.  ",
