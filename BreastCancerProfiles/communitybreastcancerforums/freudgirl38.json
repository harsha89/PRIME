I am thinking I may need to demand one just so I don't have to keep going through this everytime something is found. Thanks everyone for your thoughts and insight!",

Just a little background, I have 5 paternal aunts who have had breast cancer, 3 have died, 2 were diagnosed prior to age 50. My father also has 3 benign breast tumors, 2 years ago I found a lump went through the whole do I have cancer thing, had the untrasound and biposy, diagnosed with a fibroadenoma. I went for the BRAC DNA test and came back negative. About 3 weeks ago I developed pain in my nipple which only lasted about 2 days but the next day I had significant pain in the area of 2 o'clock on my left breast (my fibroadenoma is on my right). I feel a lump along with a somewhat dense feeling, it is painful to touch, my breast is swollen and its getting to the paint where it hurts to walk (I have size G breasts). I of course called my oncologist to sched an apt which is set for this Friday. But I had my physical recently and the only abnormality I have is elevated platelets. So I was doing ok with all of this before as I have been through all of thisÂ previously but now due to the breast issues, the increase platelets that are unexplained, the onset of extreme fatigue and low grade fever I am begninning to stress a bit. I am glad the apt is only 2 days away but I know its still a waiting process to get apts and results. I just needed to share my story and see if anyone had smiliar symptoms. I know that breast pain is not usually related to cancer but given the history I take any breast issue very seriously. Log in to post a reply",
