AND, I might add that I took just one capsule of St. John's Wort (wort=plant) a day and it helped to take the edge off. There is no one answer for everyone here, and the PTSD comment is SO right on - - had never thought of that, but gosh, how true.  But these are practical things that I grabbed hold of fast in order to take charge of me again.  Being in Control of ANYthing is a huge boost in setting our sites straight again.  You know, Shirley Hughes puts the Serenity Prayer on her comments. Sure applies: God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can and the Wisdom to know the difference.  Sisters, help your bodies help themselves.  Get up and do something for YOU now.  It's easier to ACT your way into a new way of thinking than it is to THINK your way into a new way of acting. Forgive the philosophical moment here! SO many hugs to all of you.  This site has helped me so much.  Music Teacher",
