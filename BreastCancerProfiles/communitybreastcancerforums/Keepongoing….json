I plan to enjoy every second of my life to the best of my ability and try to push the dark thoughts back. The very day i got my path results I lost a college classmate of colon cancer and have since lost a high school buddy of brain cancer. ( both males) I have taken this and my situation as a big wake up call that life has no guarantees . I was going to walk in a Komenwalk in oct but instead I'm going to the beach with my sisters. Find what gives you joy and do that . The 5 year survival rates are good. Think you'll be in that group. ðŸ’•",

It's not painful and saves a trip back for injection. luckily my insurance covered it. It felt like a mild rubber band snap on the skin going in. Taking it off is just peeling the sticky tape off . I am thankful for it saving my WBC count from dropping and not missing any chemo",

I was just a few weeks post chemo and had my scarf on to cover my almost bald head. Hair is back with thick chemo curls this year and I rolled up my scarf for a head band. I had long straight hair about to shoulders before chemo. Not quite sure what to do with this hair but am finally coming to an appreciation of it. Was almost as hard taking off my wig as it was to walk out in it the first few times! My hair growth was slow at first but seems to be growing like crazy now. Used nioxin shampoo at first when hair started growing out. Hang in there ladies who are just finishing up chemo. ",

I'm not sure if he is just saying that or not. Im not sure I'm ready to go all gray yet. The short is going to be hard enough because my hair was shoulder blade length . I started out with a long wig now I mostly wear a shorter wavy one that is my usual hair color so to go to short white hair is kinda shocking to me . I may wear wigs until I color it and my bangs catch up",
