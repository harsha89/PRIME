Counseling was helpful and being open about treatment as it's just too hard to hide the reality when your living with this monster. The sad thing for me was when she would say Why can't you be normal like the other mums, just heartbreaking. She doesn't say that anymore, just worries about me leaving her. Hopefully not any time soon. I wish you well, hugs. Wendy.",

My oncologist has just taken me off femera after 4 years , to start taking arimidex which I will begin in a couple off weeks. She thinks it may improve my bone pain, worth a try. She did say that the femra and arimidex were very similar. I have had hot flushes, weight gain and loss of bone density and bone pain. I also have insomnia, but its amazing what you will put up with to keep this disease controlled. Im actually a little nervous about changing drugs when its still working. I also have herceptin every 3 weeks and an anual dose of zometa for osteoporosis. You just learn to live with it, hopefuly a lot longer. Cheers Wendy.",

Its reassuring to no the arimidex is ok too, I always worry about my heart function as I had a little blip in 2008 and had to have a 3 month break from the herceptin, luckily it improved and I was allowed to resume taking it. I was dx stage 4 with my initial dx in 2005. Cheers Wendy.",

A liver resection was on the cards for me too but only as a back up, as statistacly liver tumors dont respond well to chemo. Its a different journey for us all as the cancers behave differently for each of us. Now I have regular scans and marker tests and its controlled who knows for how long, only God. I wish you all the very best its so frightening at the beginning to know what to think and do .",
