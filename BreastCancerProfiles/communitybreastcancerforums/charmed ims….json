I already had a doc appt but wasn't sure if I'd be wasting time. I found a lump 2 months ago but chose to ignore it because I couldn't always feel it, it's been there yesterday & today but this afternoon I can't feel it again. I've got discharge too, I'd rather not wait another few months & pass it off, life is more important than work!!! Go to your doc & get it checked xx",

I've had nipple discharge since I was 17 (32 now). I finally plucked up courage to go to doc yesterday (nearly chickened out) & blow me, within 4 hours, I've already got a hospital appointment through so coz of the speed of it, I am concerned. I live in the UK & our NHS service is fairly slow, hence my worry as the appointment came through so darn quick. My partner keeps also telling me not to worry & I do think it's because he's afraid of it himself & is trying to look brave for me. When I showed him the discharge I swear I've never seen someone go so pale in my life! He knows deep down I am absolutely scared as hell but I put on a big 'I'm not worried' front. He is scared too but always says don't worry. In fact, I'm trying to keep my humour about it & I've made a few jokes & he tuts at me & says 'you haven't got cancer don't be stupid'. Now that remark really gets on my nerves! I would say that you could bet your bottom dollar that your family are as worried sick as you are, they're just trying to be supportive because there's not really much else someone can say to us all except either \"be brave\" or \"don't worry\". The support on this forum is fantastic & big cheers & hugs for all those that are on here. I think I'd be a nervous wreck by now if I hadn't found this site.",
