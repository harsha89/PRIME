      "Content": "Alo wrote: Hi I am really worried because this morning I woke up with a large red ring around the side of my breast. The centre of the ring is my normal pale coloured skin (with no sign of a bite, swelling, itching etc) but the ring around it is about 1cm wide and red. None of it is sore or itchy, which is why I don't really think it's an insect bite. But it is usual for IBC to ocurr in a ring like this? If I were back home I would go to my doctor straight away, but I am away for 2 weeks on holiday and I don't know whether to just jump on the next flight home or not. I know that IBC is really aggressive so if it is that I shouldn't just wait and see.. Does anyone have any advice? Also, if I did see my doctor, will they just tell me to keep an eye on it? Thanks so much Log in to post a reply",
