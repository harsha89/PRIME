My family and friends all argues for me not to stop but I explained to them IF the cancer came back... I have been at complete peace with my choice. Here I am 5 years later, still cancer free! Praise GOD!! I made the right choice with a lot of prayer. Find peace with it and go with your heart! Praying for you! Sherri",
