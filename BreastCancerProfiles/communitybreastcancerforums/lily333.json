I went to see a doctor about it 4 months ago and he told me it was some kind of a breast deformation. I was relieved to hear that as anyone would be ! but for 2 and a half months now i have been having a lot of headaches, nausea, i am always tired and sometimes dizzy. I lost a lot of my appetite and i feel like something is wrong. With everyone saying that having breast cancer at 17 years is \"impossible\" but some of breast cancer's symptoms showing, i don't know what to think. Maybe some of you have something to say to put me in the right direction... Log in to post a reply",
