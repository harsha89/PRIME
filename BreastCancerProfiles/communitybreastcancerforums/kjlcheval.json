Hopefully what was seen on my liver is not cancerous and I can then go to surgery. If not then my journey changes. That\u2019s just a little frightening. Insurance has been denying everything it seems. My MO\u2019s nurse practitioner says she has a way of getting things done. So I think a few tears will be shed in the next few days (I can cry reading a book!) plus it\u2019s that time of the month (that won\u2019t be happening any more! Whoohoo!). My husband lost his previous wife to colon cancer. I feel guilty. So the next 2 weeks...hopefully PET scan, echo, port...my sister has a port (CF & double lung transplant). Life marches on",

Hopefully it\u2019s just the stress of the day and not a side effect. I was really nervous going in and they were running behind. I closed the infusion bar tonight. They locked the doors behind us. Good night ladies",
