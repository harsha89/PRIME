It is not without it's SEs, too, and sometimes it's difficult to tell if what you're feeling is from the chemo drugs, the nausea meds, the steroids or the Neulasta. I am heartbroken for what StillVerticle has had to face, and it's issues like hers that made me so incredibly terrified to go forward with chemo. None of us would have gone through this is we knew the outcome would be like what StillVerticle has experienced. But the majority of cases DO NOT turn out like that. You will undoubtedly have some of the SEs everyone reads and talks about. But to have them all, in such a dramatic way, is just incredibly unusual. A risk, yes. What percentage of risk no one can say. I got whopping a rash from the Taxotere 12 days after my 2nd tx.  My onc wasn't convinced it was related to the chemo at all. So I phoned the manufacturer and worked my way to the Medical Info Department where they write the Rx info for docs, as well as the patient brochures. I went directly to the source to get clarification. I spent 30 years in medical research and knew that there were tests, trails and statistics to support or refute my issue. Don't be afraid to ask questions from anyone who might have the answer. This website, www.breastcancer.org, is a total lifesaver. I did spend 30 years in medical research, hands-on, doing the patient testing, and eventually as the research administrator in charge of a two different federally funded clinical research centers at major medical schools on the east coast.  We were doing Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials on cancer patients when these chemo drugs didn't have product names, just were known as the chemicals. I was terrified to start chemo. This website was the catalyst for my progression into chemo treatment. And now I'm more than 1/2 way through and hope to make it to the end, victorious and triumphant. (note: I'm telling you about my medical background, not because I believe that I have all the answers, but because I think it gave me a different perspective and may have actually hindered my recovery had I not found this website and been able to communicate with others who are going through this at the same time or who have recently been there to share their experiences and encouragement). I'm sitting here, 18 hrs. after my 3rd TC+H tx and have a slight headache. Nothing terrible. I go for the injection in 6 hrs. If all holds true to the last two times, the wobbly legs will begin tomorrow and I'll be 'sofa surfing' for a few days. My driving isn't great for about 8 or 10 days because I am anemic now...RBC down and causes dizziness. That mixed with the motion of the car gets gives me what I call DUIC...driving under the influence of chemo. So during that time I allow my type A personality to literally take a backseat and I get chauffeured by family and friends if I need to go out at all. And I do work some almost every day. When my head is feeling 'fuzzy' I just avoid doing contracts and major business deals (personal and professional) for a a few days. This isn't easy. I'll never paint a rosy picture of chemo and some peole have it so much worse than others. But it's DOABLE.  I think it's a 'minute-by-minute' thing. I hear Michael McDonald singing that old Doobie Brothers song...\"minute by minute...I keep holding on\". One of the favorite things a woman named Jayne posted to me on the forum I'm terrified of chemotherapy is You Don't Have to Be Brave. You Just Have to Show Up. I love that. A friend made me an 8X11  framed poster of that with the Susan G. Komen pink ribbon running down the side. I have it on the bathroom vanity that this is about letting my faith overcome my fear. Hugs to you and hoping that your chemo benefits are maximal and the SEs are minimal.  Bon",

It's was one of the most difficult parts of my cancer diagnosis, too. But I found that all the worry and fretting didn't do anything but debilitate me even further.  As Pollyannish as this might sound, the thing that helped me the most while waiting was listening to podcasts/tapes/cd's on positive thinking. Not that thinking positive makes it all go away. But that envisioning the positive outcome helps to get to that goal.  They helped me focus on a cancer-free future and to know that nothing is easy but it is worth the fight.  I listened to ones mostly directed to business, because that is one speaker whom I know, but his topics and ideas could be easily applied to almost any of life's challenges.  And when I was listening to him, I couldn't be worrying, too. And another thing I did to occupy my mind and increase those endorphins was to laugh as much as possible. I watched a lot of dumb sitcoms and silly movies and found that laughing out loud really takes away anxiety. And it makes you forget your worry for a while. Any worry-free time is welcome, right? Even now, after surgery and into treatment, I still listen to the podcasts and keep my eye on the goal. And I have friends sending me jokes daily, along with an array of cd's of their favorite comedy movies and sitcoms. You will make it through and with the help of forums like these and your own family and friends, you'll have someone caring and sharing every step of the way.  Wishing you the best.   Bon",

I ended up using a combo platter of meds to keep it reasonably in check since the Protonix wasn't doing the job. I took Prilosec in the morning, Gas-ex at noon, Pepcid at dinner time, Tums whenever necessary, and another Prilosec before bed. My purse was full of pills. About 2.5 weeks after chemo ended the GERD subsided and I tapered off on the drug cocktail. But at the end of last week it was back full force. So I started all over again...today I decided to just go back to Protonix in the AM and see if I can fill in the gaps with Pepcid and maybe a 2nd Protonix at bedtime. I'm a little scared of Prilosec due to all the warnings on the packaging. I don't have a gallbladder anymore so can't blame it on that.",

The clods are so self-interested that they either don't acknowledge another's illness or trauma, or they say something so stupid you look around to be sure you aren't on Candid Camera. The ones who go into panic mode are often friends who just can't face that something awful is happening to someone they care about or they cry instead of speak encouragingly. I have a couple of friends who took quite a long time to call or write because they admitted that they had a difficult time processing the information that I have cancer.   So now I am giving email updates to approximately 75 people on a regular basis. I'm doing it so that they can understand up close and personal how this diagnosis affects me. Perhaps my reactions and issues aren't the same as everyone else with breast cancer, or any other cancer for that matter, but I've got their attention and they now know something about ports, chemo, hair loss, side effects and how they may be able to help in little ways...most of them never were this close to cancer before. They certainly know people along the way who have had cancer, but no one close enough to them where they could ask questions and get details. The list of those getting my journaling includes friends at a distance, colleagues, clients. They are supportive beyond belief and grateful that I've given them an inside view on how I feel emotionally and physically as this entire scenario progresses. Each time I write to them, I tell them about all of you and how grateful I was to find you here. You understand what I am going through when I will be shaving my head tonight because you've been on this ride. They will learn about it all and, I hope, be so much more compassionate the next time they encounter someone going through a battle similar to this. They will never again be able to say they didn't know what is entailed with a cancer diagnosis, even if it is 2nd hand. And I'll always pray that they never have to be in our shoes. (Although those ruby slippers that DesignerMom is sporting are mighty nice). Wishing you all a good evening. I'm off to see my own Wizard this evening...the one with the shaver!  Bon",

All seems to help the cause and although it wasn't a breeze, it was tolerable. If you can get something to stop the reflux, then the nausea subsides a bit. And then you can drink and maybe even eat. I ate carbs like mad for the first two days. God bless Nabisco Sugar Wafers. Cannot tolerate water or fortified water any more. It hits my stomach like lead and causes me to be sicker. Had to switch to flavored waters, decaf green tea, diluted juices. Popsicles helped, too. Gave up on the healthy eating thing, just happy to be able to eat. I figure it this way: while I'm on chemo, I'm being poisoned anyway. So come on additives, Come on flavor enhancers. Come on whatever tastes less like metal slathered with bug spray. It might not be organic but if I want it and it stays down, I'm eating it. All the antioxidants in the world aren't going to help if I'm gagging. So for now I'm Scarlett, and I'll worry about the healthy eating gig tomorrow.  Hope you are all well enough to go out to your own special place for that 15 minutes of rejuvenation.",

It's an accomplishment that all of us can cheer, even if our chemo regimens are different. Being on this side of the aisle is so incredibly humbling. I will never look at anyone dealing with cancer and it's treatments and aftermaths the same way as I did before. Used to be that I 'felt sorry' and then pretty much forgot about it. No more. My heart goes out and my hats off to anyone facing these challenges. AND...you made it to work.  Hope your day goes well. There are some days I can't work at all, others when I'm good for about 4 hours. More than that and I'm a zombie.I have never been one to sleep much. Although I'm known to be in bed pretty early every night, I've never slept past 6ish, even on weekends. And I never was one to nap. Now it's totally different. I can nap anytime and do. And I'm in bed by 10 and sleep straight through until the dogs can't wait any longer and rouse me by 7. And if they didn't bark or nudge me, I'd keep sleeping. RE, dizziness, my onc nurse said that one of the signs of anemia and low red cell production is a sort of dizziness. So I think that's why I have trouble driving. The dizziness coupled with the motion of the car gives me a bobble-head doll feeling and I really am DUIC...driving under the influence of chemo. She says that will get better when my red counts are back up...someday. The dizziness is either that or the meds for indigestion/reflux. I couldn't take Prilosec because it made me incredible dizzy and Zantac had me shaking like a leaf and almost unable to walk because it messed with my BP. I am highly sensitive to those types of meds and it could be my Protinix and not the anemia that's making me wobbly. Well, I'm staying on the Protonix so I'll have to learn to deal with the 'moving' sidewalks and all the rest of it. Yesterdays posts had much to do with 'regularity'. When I went to get a script filled,  I asked the pharmacist for a recommendation. She suggested a stool softener if I was going to take any of the oxycodone prescribed (which, thankfully, I never did need) and then a daily fiber prep. I got Miralax, which I haven't had to use, and then Metamucil capsules. I've been taking two of those every day and it's seems to help. The probiotic prep I use is DigestiveAdvantage for Irritable Bowel. I take that, too. The combo seems to have everything just right.  Aren't you glad you now know my bathroom secrets. The level of personal info we share on this site amazes me...but I'm always grateful to learn from others how to control or deal with every SE that might come along. And Janny99,,, thanks for the laugh! I can imagine the look on your face when it dawned on you that a urinal and a guy using it meant OOPS! Hope everyone conquers another day with style! I'm off to meet a client. She is aware fo my diagnosis and treatment so will understand if I'm unable to last the whole day.",

This is a highly emotionally charged event in your life. I'm sorry that you get weepy but if that's how you can cope with it, then grab a box of tissues and cry it out. Then pick yourself up and move on. Remember, there's nothing wrong with a good cry. Keeps those tear ducts moist and functioning so chemo doesn't mess them up, too. But do take that RX to help with anxiety. This is scary stuff we're dealing with. Whatever can help you through is a blessing. You are probably too young to remember the old Monsanto tag line... Better living through chemistry. Personally I think I've channeled my 'emotional' stuff into fighting this damn disease and worrying that the treatment will get me before BC ever does. I came to this website about 11 days before I began chemo and started a forum \"I'm terrified of chemotherapy\". Still am, but I'm trying to work with it now.",

I did ask this question before and didn't get any response, but I thought I'd try again....did anyone experience debilitating headaches after Cytoxan and Taxotere+ Herceptin? I also got Decadron IV that first day, along with Aloxi for nausea. The headache started day 3 after the first round and lasted until day 11. I've now had 4  days without a headache, today makes day 5. And I have another chemo scheduled for this Wednesday. Someone suggested on another blog that it might have something to do with the Decadron dosage and sudden withdrawal. Whatever it is, I just can't take the headaches and stiff neck for another 3 or 5 rounds. I truly won't make it. I get violently ill from morphine, Demerol, codeine, Darvon, percoset (SP) etc. They tell me that oxycodone can potentially do the same thing to me and that Darvocet may work, I'll take that this go around. But did anyone else get these headaches and stiff neck?  Thanks for any suggestions you may have.  Bon",

They provide free hat wraps for any cancer patient, knowing that hair loss is a traumatic part of the diagnosis and treatment process, and that a lush and lovely head wrap is a most welcome gift. Gail Arch (aka GailA) left work in 2009 to fight the fight with metastatic cancer. She wanted something to do, as if fighting cancer isn't already a full time job. She decided to sew a few hats from materials she collected in her world travels, and to give them away to women also fighting the same battle.  Three of her friends (Sarah Adams, Paige Yates and Debby Belichick) merged thier talents, expanded on the idea and forged ahead to form this public charity that helps women living with cancer. Go to http://www.gailafund.org/ and looks them over. Then click on the form and sign up to receive one FREE. They even let you put down three of your favorites and they really do try to send one of those almost immediately upon receipt of your registration. They have a huge selection of colors and fabrics...even silks and soft linens. And yes, the would love donations and they do sell these wraps so if you'd like more than one you can purchase at any time. Or if a friend offers to get you a gift, maybe another Gaila headwrap would be nice. But they don't push you into any purchase and truly just want you to have a free hatwrap. Really, do give this a try. It's a very lovely and sincere gesture. They can't take the cancer away but they can gift you a beautiful headpiece to wear with pride Giving credit where it's due...I first heard of this through an early post by DesignerMom...thank you.",

I take OTC Prilosec first thing in the AM, then Gas-x at lunchtime, followed by Pepcid-AC at dinner and another Prilosec at bedtime. And the occasional Tums as needed. When I went for my rads consult this week, the RO told me to keep on that for a while and then see if being out of chemo a month or 6 weeks doesn't help straighten it out some. I can tell you that I've not been having such a problem mid-day now 2 weeks after the last chemo, but it still isn't right and I won't stop my self medicating regimen for fear the pain will come back full force. grney5600...Jackie, I love the q-tip idea! Very imaginative. And as for eye-lashes, I've been reading other boards to get info on rads and beyond. And I found a board where the women were discussing how their eyebrows and particularly their eyelashes fell out a few weeks AFTER chem was over. That was pretty annoying to read, since I'd just convinced myself that the lashes left needed mascara and I was ready to go buy some. But also on that board was info that a L'Oreal product for lashes, some type of reconditioning product, worked well. So I will go lokk for that.  JFV...Joan, my port still bothers me and I really hate the idea of having it for another 9 months, but it has saved my one good vein for blood draws so I'll keep it and pray that it continues to work. I just find that I can't roll over during the night or it gets 'crushed' and is painful. I just have to learn to sleep on my back more. And HOORAY for you that your last Taxol is next Wednesday!  Another milestone! Oh, and how did you like the RO? DesignerMom...Ok, flourless chocolate cake won't help me lose the extra pounds (and I do wish they were going to drop off instantly when this chemo has totally cleared my system, though I doubt it's all water weight, but it's so sweet of you to say so) but it sounds great. I actually looked at a recipe for that this past weekend when I was trying to see about making something special for my Mom who must remain gluten free. I didn't make it but I thought about it. Do I get some points for that? Oh, Just an FYI... I was reading a board where the women are part-way or nearly through the rads tx and found that someone's RO or MO recommended taking Ibuprofen 3X/day during rads tx, saying that even many weeks into rads women avoid bad burns if on Ibuprofen. Next week I will ask my MO if it's OK to do that while I'm still on Herceptin and then run it past the RO, too,  when I go for staging on the 17th.",

I'll be going 35 to 40 minutes each way vs. 75 to 90 minutes, so I'm elated to cut down on the drive time. I originally thought I was supposed to get 25 rads tx but looks like I'm in for 33. Lucky me. About fruits and veggies...Early on I was instructed not to eat any raw fruit or veggies, not even some you can peel. Bananas were OK and apples, if peeled, not tomatoes. And nothing green and leafy. I cheated, bought a good salad spinner and washed iceberg or romaine at home (but only ate it occasionally), but nothing cut up and packaged or in restaurants, not even on a sandwich. My oncs instructions were that while you are so immunosuppressed you should avoid the foods that are the greatest risk...like ecoli from organic spinach that killed a number of people a few years ago and the packaged, salad greens that so often have to be recalled. (He also told me to say clear of ground beef since that is the biggest animal source of ecoli. And he said to limit the meals I ate in restaurants to places I really knew kept a clean kitchen).  I'm glad no one who has been eating fresh stuff has become ill. I've missed big salads and I'm back on fresh fruit and veggies now that I'm post chemo and my WBC are running on the high side. I actually had a lobster roll yesterday with fresh celery in the lobster salad with a lettuce leaf under it. Felt human to order something without telling the waitress to leave off this and that. My dietary restrictions now are really just to help stave off the GERD...so nothing fried or spicy or citrus.I suppose that will help me to diet since I've gained weight, not lost it, during the chemo.",

You've been through a really tough time but sound like your spirits are up and you're ready to fight that good fight again. I'm so sorry to hear about your port and sympathize. Mine is tilted and it makes for a difficult time each infusion. One of the stitches holding it in place was snipped to alleviate the pulling. But that means it's lopsided and I can actually manipulate it under my skin. Creepy!  Sorry your new one won't be ready for the next round. How long do they intend for you to wait? I got my port on a Friday and had chemo that next Wednesday. I'm with you on diet. Right now I intend to eat whatever I can keep down and what appeals to me. I will worry about the healthy stuff when the chemo and rads are over. The one thing I'm trying to be careful with is fresh fruit and vegetables. They are supposed to be a no-no while having chemo since there is such a high incidence of produce contamination. Even cantaloupe is supposed to be one of the biggest harbingers of contamination because of the rind...and when you slice through the rind you spread the bacteria. But I cannot give up lettuce and tomatoes. Or celery. So I scrub the heck out of them, bruise the lettuce and wash it like mad, but I still eat them. Everyone can tell when I feel well because I have my salad. Rash update...I've had almost a full day of prednisone to squelch the itching. But as I sit here typing this it is spreading down the inside of my left arm from shoulder to elbow. This is maddening. I'm on my way to eat some cereal and take the morning dose. Then I'm going to find the number of the manufacturer and get to the bottom of this rash thing from Taxotere. It may take me a while but I'm determined to find out more before they try to give me the next IV dose. The literature says that rash is common but only serious in 5% of cases. Well, I think that this is mighty serious after 4 days, benadryl and prednisone...and it's still going strong.

It eventually cleared up and she squelched the itch that did develop with hydrocortisone cream. I'd say that a rash IS common in patients actively undergoing chemo and the manufacturer says so in the literature that they give to patients. I just think that the oncs don't see it much because most patients don't report it because they think it's a bug bite or just totally unrelated. Package insert says it's only considered 'severe' in 5% of patients anyway. Severe or not, it's annoying. I sure wouldn't rule out any rash as not being related to chemo. Sanofi-Aventis says it's common, happens 'between' treatments and 'generally goes away before your next treatment. Of course, I'm so flipping annoyed with my onc, I could be over reacting here. I am on Prednisone and feeling feisty.  But don't for a hot minute think that that happens to you for the next few months isn't related to a chemo SE. It probably is. Maybe not on the level of a true allergy, but yet another glorious SE.",

It's very comprehensive but controversial since Karen Hurd is recommending soy as part of a standard diet. I personally know at least 5 women who were diagnosed with ER+,PR+ tumors and told by their docs to cut out all soy forever, due to the estrogen-like effect of soy supplements. I know that some sites and nutritionist say they think the benefits outweigh the risks, but that's subjective, too.  Besides that, there are so many soy allergies now that it's becoming epidemic. Personally, I love it but it doesn't love me and causes me to have severe, violent and dibilitating diarrhea. I can't eat soy in any form and am always doing a fast trot for a very long and uncomfortable stay in a nearby bathroom when it's added to something I haven't investigated before eating. The AMC says eat fresh fruit and veggies. Other sites warn against fresh stuff unless properly washed and eaten at home. And even that may not be so safe. Organic isn't the best either. All those people died a few years ago from organically grown spinach at a California farm where the ground water was contaminated with e coli. I checked the websites for instructions on washing produce and found that the commercially available washes are not tested so there for not recommended. They do say to soak and rinse in cold water, wash all rind fruits before peeling. On a side note, I was told by my onc and 4 other post chemo women not to even garden,nor to handle any fresh flowers, one, for fear of bacterial or fungal contamination, and two, for fear that insects might be lurking, resulting in bites that could cause infection while immuno-suppressed. I know we are supposed to be trying to adopt or adapt to healthier lifestyles. But which nutritional 'guru' to follow is a difficult choice. Personally, if it wasn't for additives, food dyes and flavorings there would be nothing I could swallow now. Water without something added causes instant nausea. I gained 5 lbs in 8 days on Prednisone. Not a good thing, but it will go away and I made it through. Food that goes down and stays down is the important thing right now, in my opinion. I have 1 more TC tx to go and will attempt to address the need for less processed food choices when I'm undergoing radiation or after I have the oopherectomy. For me, on a personal level, I have just too much to deal with already and can't fathom going the nuts and berries route just yet. This is already torturous enough. If and when I can eat now, I choose to eat whatever tastes reasonable, no matter how many chemicals it contains. This nutritional stuff is another topic that's wide open for interpretation and has no definitive answer. Something else I hate about a cancer diagnosis. Nothing is black and white...it's all 3-D amazing Technicolor, almost like a fast paced dreamlike. You look and look and wonder what you just saw. Being one who operates on a diagnostic, scientific level, this is maddening.  DesignerMom, I am not trying to be argumentative, nor discount your discovery of Karen Hurd. I always enjoy and appreciate your take on things and know you do thorough research. Just throwing in my 2 cents worth for the rest like me who may not have the stamina, wherewithal or inclination to deal with another big life change right now.  Bon",

I looked up the history of chemo and can't believe how brave and/or desperate the people were who took it first in the 40's, then in the 50's when they say it was 'widely accepted practice', and in the 60's and 70's when docs started experimenting with combining the chemotherapy drugs. I was there when we were doing clinical trials on the drugs we are taking now, taxol and cytoxan to be specific, when they didn't even have product names and were known by just their chemical names. Look at the difference in our treatments now depending upon our tumor typing. That's so incredibly new. My concern, however, is that having such specific targeted therapy may not cover you as well for life. if you have a ER,PR negative tumors now, can you still develop an ER,PR positive tumor later? Amazing the advances they have made so far. Here's hoping they quickly get even more proven progressive and comprehensive treatments up, running, and widely available.",

YES, check with any pharmacist you trust...I know mine at the local Wal-Mart were better versed in how to handle all the meds I'm getting than was Brunhilda and my onc. A decent pharmacist is a wondrous thing. (Yes, I confess, I go to Wally-World for my meds because they're far less expensive). One more idea...I have a friend who is a nurse and a clinical research monitor for a company that checks on docs doing clinical trials in their various offices and facilities. Just telling you that so you know she has a medical background and research's everything thoroughly, too. She has suffered for years with outbreaks of cold sores that were, quite frankly, disgusting. They are a herpes of a sort, too, correct? She has been taking lysine for ages now and gave up all citrus...including tomatoes (but she is Italian and eats sauce because the cooking takes a lot of the acid out, or so she thinks). And she never gets outbreaks anymore. Maybe lysine isn't powerful enough or doesn't fight the blockbuster shingle variety of the latent virus, but it might be worth a try and I think it' pretty innocuous. A full course of Acyclovir seems like going after a fly with a cannon. But hey, I'm no doc or pharmacist, and I'm loopy from lack of sleep, so you can easily discount anything I say today.  I know you're sick of the research already, but you an always try my tactic...if they have US R&D, call the manufacturer, ask for customer service and the Medical Information Department, get the pharmacists who write the prescribing info and patient pamphlets, and see what they can tell you about it's contraindications, synergistic effects and warnings. Of course now it's late on Friday afternoon and they won't be there or won't be easy to find in that firm. That's the story of my life...if something happens that requires a quick response, you can bet it will get dumped on me at the very last minute on Friday afternoon and can't be dealt with until Monday. If you go this route, hope you get an answer soon.",

Even old Brunhilda seemed really disheartened that there wasn't some other suggestion offered. I may have to take back all nasty comments about her up until now. Any decent office would have a GI doc or two in the wings ready to take on patients who might need to be seen for something like this. They should have all sorts of specialists lined up to help their chemo patients with whatever issues arise. You can't tell me they don't see lots of patients who develop problems from the chemo. I have absolutely no faith in my MO. None at all. And with only 1 more tx to go on the 25th I cannot switch now. It's too late. I should have done it after tx 1. My error. I only signed on with this guy because my BS recommended him so highly. And I adore my BS and his bedside manner is flawless. WOW...to think that I've got to deal with this MO for the next few years is maddening. The stomach/solar plexus pain is lessening and I'm only eating bland, bland, bland. Jaw pain is totally associated with GERD. I am not having cardiac issues.  I will check around with GI docs tomorrow to see if anyone will take me as a rush patent and get whatever tests needed finished before round 4 begins in 9 days. In the meantime I keep working. Wrote a  purchase offer today and listed another property. I have to work to eat (and burp)...and to pay my medical bills! ",

I'll start by saying that I apologize for not being with-it enough to address everyone's issues individually. But I will say to RS711...call your doc today. If you haven't already addressed this issue with him.her/them, then call. Everyone seems to be trying to find that one MD who will drive the proverbial bus for total care. Like Cheyenne found, her PP said she will deal with the whole body and let the MO deal with chemo. So I guess if you don't have another doc who you trust to be there for you, call the MO and try to get this sorted out. After all, most MOs are hematologists, too, although the sub-specialties differ. They should know how to help you get your CBC in line and tell you what to do about the multiple periods. I hope you find someone to talke to who can put your mind at ease. Ok, wish I'd taken my own advice. Am still suffering with GERD but have it more under control on multiple meds. Not ideal but I really didn't have anyone who will be my bus driver now.Am just waiting to have 4th and, I hope, final round of TCH tomorrow and then get a GI consult. Speaking of which, my Mom ended up at the GI office today and they put her on yet another antibiotic for the Salmonella. Now she is on Flagyl and Cipro and told to take Imodium, eat yogurt and take acidophilus. And she is going to be 89 on October 11th.  She had wanted to be hospitalized because she feels so terrible but they aren't giving her any special concern because of age, frailness and the fact that she has lymphoma and her counts are down. I am so worried about her and really can't do much for her right now. Thank heavens my step-father is such a good guy and keeps all the plates spinning. What's that saying about when it rains, it pours?",

Have been catching up on the posts for the last couple of days. Sherry...don't go anywhere, please. Many here, unfortunately, have lots of chemo to go and everyone would miss you. We've started out together. I'd hope we can all reach NED status together, too. Kittycat...you are gorgeous in either photo you choose. It's nice to see that smile with real hair or that blonde wig. At least this way it is a reminder of better times AND you don't have to keep answering the question about your fireworks. Sorry that the tape irritation come up. Seems like you've had just about everything the can crop up, doesn't it? JFV...I love that you were doing the prima scream with me!  You are loud!  I heard it all the way in Florida. DesignerMom...whenever I'm frustrated and want to escape a particular place or situation I often look skyward and say \"Beam me up, Scotty\".  So we all need a transporter to get us to your soundproof room. We'll enter quietly on our own and just yell our lungs out. Then we'll go frolic in Central Park  and drink champagne.  (Had to switch to from margaritas the acid is too much for my chemo damaged stomach now).  How's that for imagination. A girl can dream, can't she? Workermom...My first radiation oncology consult is next week, too, on Wednesday, so we'll be entering this new adventure at the same time. I'm just as nervous about that as I was about chemo. Julia2...Jobs come and go...how you are treated physically and mentally at this point in your life is what counts most.  Try not worry too much. Congrats on being BRAC negative. I haven't had the BRAC testing done yet but will probably just have full hysterectomy after radiation. lizzyanne...I got a wicked rash from Taxotere that didn't respond to Benadryl and needed a wallop from steroids. Latte...fingers crossed that your CT scan is totally clear! Mimi9186...I sincerely hope you are feeling a bit better and that you have been able to work things our with the doc who is covering for your absent MO.  That just seems weird that he'd up and leave for so long without any warning. Is he ill himself, perhaps? Chey...you sound stronger. I hope it's for real and that you'll have more peaceful days. It's OK to cry...this is tough stuff. But you can't cry all the time. There are things still out there to be grateful for and to smile about. NorthernGirl...I'm so sorry about your bone pain and neuropathy. I've only had bone and muscle pain after the Neulasta and that was minor compared to what you are going through. I hope that they can find something to lessen the pain.  Tmarina, Vicky, Mitymuffin and grney5600 all sound like they have it under control right now. Hope that's true.Did I leave anyone out? Hope not. Latest on the Mom front: They scoped her colon today and I'm waiting for her doc to call me. I don't think they found anything out of the ordinary except for swelling. DUH! Try having constant diarrhea for two + weeks and see how swollen your colon would be.  Finally they are not talking about moving her out of the hospital until they get to the bottom of this. The dietitian is trying to do the right thing but she really has never been challenged like this before. But they are still feeding her things like bacon. She has an irritated colon. She shouldn't be having any processed meats. There are specific requirements for an irritated bowel that should be followed for now, along with all the other dietary restrictions Mom has. The only way I'm going to get this resolved with the food is to approve every tray that enters the room. I've told my Mom to phone me when the tray arrives and we'll go over what she should eat from it. I am making them a spread sheet of all the acceptable foods which are culled from each set of dietary restrictions. I'd expect my Mom to be confused by the conflicting information on each individual diet, but it just seems so substandard to have a professional dietary staff that can't get it right. I thank each of you for your kind thoughts and prayers on behalf of my Mom. She isn't a saint...all Moms and daughters have issues. But she's vital and was still more than capable until this all started. Heck, she was sending me emails with links to all sorts of things, from political to medical to recipes to jokes and on and on. She isn't ready to sit in a corner and chew paper. Her docs have known her for years and I just had to jerk them around a bit to get them back to seeing her as the person, not just another older patient.  Yesterday they teased her and gave her the \"Stump the Doctor Award\".  Now that they are paying attention, I have hope that she'll be OK.  I certainly hope so. She should be OUR poster child...she survived ovarian cancer when she was just 30 and breast cancer when she was 60. Back then they didn't give her any choices about surgeries or treatments...just did a BMX and later reconstruction which wasn't common and is very crude. No chemo, no radiation. They didn't have the sophisticated tests then that we have available to us now. And she really suffered silently, without a support system like we have to comfort or guide her. All those years ago no one openly talked about cancer because it was 'suspect'. People thought it was contagious and dirty. It was kept secret. And my cute little Mom survived it all, physically and emotionally. My step-Dad is a prince of a guy who's first wife died of breast cancer. But he wasn't afraid of Mom's history and has been a shining star in her life for nearly 24 years.  They are great together. Mom has always wanted a 25th Wedding Anniversary...so she has to be well at least through November 2011. I'll fight like a banshee to get to there and beyond. Thanks for being here for me.  Bon",

Each tx seems to cause more or less exaggerated SEs from the last. Pardon me for not remembering, but how frequent are your tx now? Mine were every three weeks...after the first two I had about 10 or 12 bad days and then felt better. But #3 knocked the heck out of me and I wasn't feeling very well even as #4 was starting.  But I got through it. I know you can, too. Do you have your anti-nausea meds? If they aren't working, call your MO and ask for something else to help get the nausea under control. And ask if you can take extra strength Tylenol for the aches and pains. Have you been drinking lots? That made a world of difference for me...if I drank more and peed it out, I got the poison through my system faster. If they gave you steroids pre tx, that can account for your swelling and inability to sleep. And that, too will be helped by drinking lots to flush your system. Vicky, I was ready to give up after tx #1, after tx #2, after tx #3, and finally got to #4...but not without seriously considering just driving on past the chemo center. Take a deep breath and be good to yourself. If you don't think you can work, I hope you will be able to stay home. I know that you hear all about brave women working throughout the chemo and radiation tx. Well, I'll bet that's not the majority. Chemo is nasty...but it's helping to rid you of the cancer that got you in this mess in the first place. I know it's a tough thing to do, but think of chemo as your friend and know this is all temporary.",

I've heard from a lot of women that they would retain water after chemo. Not sure what the cause is.  So sorry for your fall but so lucky that you didn't break something. Elbows are particularly difficult...a funny story, not to take away from your plight, but a really silly visual for you....During the hurricanes of 2004, I was stuck at home with no utilities for quite a few days. I spent a lot of time on the still screened porch (no screen damage but roofs in my neighborhood were ripped up...go figure), trying to catch a cool breeze. I had one of those chairs from The Back Store, the ones that reclines, with a mesh sling seat. Well, apparently one day I didn't unfold it properly and the frame wasn't all the way opened and locked into place. So when I went to push back and recline it, BOOM, over I went, backwards, cracking my head and left elbow on the floor, wedged against the door!  The chair folded up in the process, and there I was, knees on chest, lying on my back, trapped. I literally could not move for about 5 minutes and I honestly thought I had broken my neck and was paralyzed. I finally calmed down and realized that the awkward position was what was keeping me from moving, not a neck injury, thank the Lord. So I burst out laughing and had to figure how to wiggle my way out. It took awhile but I did it and only ended up with a chipped elbow...you could feel the bone fragment moving around under the skin. That's my elbow story and I'm sticking to it!  Chey...You sound so much better!  I know you, and all of us, still have a long way to go, but hearing you sound positive and calmer is so wonderful. That alone is encouraging to me!  I'm sorry, ladies, if I have not acknowledged each of you and what you're going through. I confess to not reading many posts the last few days. I have been really preoccupied with my Mom's issues, work, rads staging.  Besides that I learned on the 14th that my health insurance has tripled as of October 1st. I'm trying to figure out how to pay it since I still need coverage and can't really go elsewhere, not with a cancer dx. Just trying to stay calm and work through all the stress. My worry beads are worn out.  Love to you all and hoping that no one has any difficulties for at least the rest of the weekend.  Bon ",

As soon as I got my first chemo tx, my long term PND stopped and all the chemo SEs took it's place as annoyances. But today, 28 days after my final chemo tx, the PND is back. Not that I'm happy about it's return...just as a point of interest regarding how long the effects of chemo last. I'm sure that there are other long-term effects of the chemo to contend with. But as of today, I honestly think I'm pretty chemo-free. Hope that means I'm cancer-free, too. Not that I'm not glad to be over the chemo and now into the radiation tx part of the race, but it's scary to be done with chemo. I don't envy you all with the multiple drug regimens, not for a minute. But I only got 4 dose-dense Taxotere/Cytoxan tx and when that dose schedule was over, I asked my onc if I should/could have any other chemo, if there was anything else he could give me to make sure the cancer was gone. And he said \"NO, that's all you need, plus the year of Herceptin\". I was elated on one hand, and more frightened than ever on the other. I know you're struggling with each and every additional tx you have left, and hate the SEs and discomfort and time it all takes...but please try to think of this chemo as your friend, not a curse.  Some friend, right? One that makes you sick and tired...but is working to save your life. I hope I can be here to cheer you on through it all, that we can support each other through every phase of tx,  and see the day when we are all NED! ",

Trying to deal with insulin at any age is tough but at nearly 89 it's just downright dangerous. She is still on prednisone and it's taking it's toll on her, just as it's done to some of us. Mom is far from 'out of the woods' yet.

Am going through rads tx with one eye on the door.  I think that for me every day will be one for making a decision whether to continue or not. With chemo we all knew that we HAD to keep going. With rads it's not so clear since the benefits are less defined. Or so I see it. No, I'm not longing for the good-old-days of chemo, Heavens, NO. Just think I understood that better than rads and found it all more tangible in some strange way. Radiation is just something out of sci-fi to me.  But, of course, I forget that the founder of Breastcancer.org is a radiation oncologist. Oh, did you listen to her personal message. She herself was diagnosed with bc earlier this year. She didn't divulge her tx for fear that every one of us would rush out and demand the same from our docs, but looks like she didn't do any chemo because she has a full head of long curly hair that definitely isn't a wig. Makes you know how random bc really is, that even she could end up fighting this damn disease.",

You sound so up-beat these days!  Wonderful that you've started moving onward and upward! Yes, don't skip the dentist appointment in January. I went last week for a cleaning and actually have a cavity...the first in about 15 or 20 years! Have to go back first week of January for the filling. The dry mouth issue promotes bacteria so everyone needs to remember to drink more, and brush and floss and rinse more. Tina...I'm so sorry that you're dealing with a heart issue and having to delay the Herceptin. But aren't you glad they keep track of all that so we don't get in more trouble. Herceptin is a miracle drug, but not without it's problems. I'm now having to deal with thyroid issues, most probably related to the radiation, but I read somewhere that Herceptin and other monoclonal antibodies can mess with thyroid function, too. Another of the many 'gifts' that can come with a cancer diagnosis.  And Tina, sorry that you have to back off orange juice and citrus. I know how hard that is...here I sit in Florida, surrounded by citrus groves, and can't eat or drink any of it due to GERD. Anyway, Tina, I still think you are a most inspiring person to have dealt with cancer twice in two years. You, too, Kitty. I admire you more than words can say. Ginny...I sure hope you got a great door prize this year!  And I'm so sorry that pre-diabetes is an issue after chemo. I swear that after chemo and radiation we are susceptible to almost every ailment and disease syndrome know to man. Yes, I repeat, cancer...the gift that keeps on giving. And Ginny, thanks for sharing the stories of Julia. I know it can't be easy to see your Mom in that condition, but how you are facing it with good humor and love is awesome. Mimi...congratulations on making it through rads!  I'm sorry that your lymphedema is a problem and hope that you can get some relief. Yes, feeling mangled, poisoned and burned is appropriate because that's what's happened to you. Your family wants to celebrate and you are still hurting...but they love you and are grateful for your endurance and survival. I, too, have struggled from the fatigue but understand that it gets better with time. Someone told me last week to give myself three months post radiation.  Ok, that clock is ticking. For me it's been 1 month today that I had my last rads tx so I expect the switch to flip on February 5th and I should feel just fine, right! Sherry...are you feeling any better? I pray every day for your regained strength. Jackie...how are you doing? When do you start rads?  My heart cath is scheduled for Thursday, December 16th. They wanted to do it tomorrow but I begged them to wait until I can coordinate with the MO on the Herceptin. I don't want to rock that boat and I'm supposed to get 2 doses of Herceptin this month, one on the 8th and the other on the 29th. Gee, ladies, aren't you going to be glad to have 2010 behind us soon? I sure am. Even though we'll have challenges in 2011, it seems that a new year is a symbol of hope and progress. Moving on...I wish we could all get together for a girls' night PJ party, eat junk food (yes, DMom, we can have healthy stuff, too), watch 'chick flicks', share beauty tips (like hair dying and eyebrow stenciling) and just have one giant group hug as 'girl friends'.  I dearly love you all!  ",

They like to keep connected to what I'm doing, how I'm doing and when I'm doing it. I wrote a note to all of them last week, just outlining my activities month-by-month since January 2010, and included not only the cancer stuff, but all the private, personal loses I've faces, too. It was cathartic and a message of hope and accomplishment, plus thanks for having them go along with me as I struggled through. I ended by saying that I hoped 2011 would be much brighter for all.  One of my clients responded this weekend with a fabulous one-liner as follows: You should smash Frank Sinatra's \"It's Been a Very Good Year.\" Now is that priceless or what?  Out of the mouths of an English Lit professor comes one of the best lines I've heard in a long while!  Hope it makes you smile, too.

Only thing they are good for now is juice but they have to hurry, and if there are too many for the juice plan to process, they will just rot. What a shame. Mother Nature certainly seems angry at us all right now. I have bronchitis. Started Augmentin today. Pills are the biggest things I've ever seen. Makes calcium supplements look tiny.  Have another Herceptin IV tomorrow!  That's #10. Supposed to have at least another 7 to go after that, but don't know what will happen after next week. My insurance carrier is changing on 1/1/11 and I still have no word on the plan details or benefits or docs or anything. I hate this added stress.

I try to read your posts but am so tired lately that I can hardly keep up with them, let alone reply in any intelligent way. The rads tx (13 done, 20 to go) have finally kicked my butt and I'm just exhausted. I'm still trying to keep all the plates spinning and have my days filled from before dawn until dark, but I just collapse when I get home and haven't any energy to do much but feed the animals and crawl in bed. This week the RO told me to cut my schedule and rest more. So as of next week I'll try to work smarter, not harder. Plus, my dear friend from the Keys is coming tomorrow for a week to help out. I am so blessed to have some really wonderful friends, near and far, who have helped me in so many ways. My song for today is \"I get by with a little help from my friends...a little help from my friends.\" ",

My insurance is from a small group that was organized as a self-insured entity. Big companies do that all the time. This company tried it and it failed miserably. I didn't qualify for cobra because the insurance carrier (United Health Care) pulled out of small group coverage in Florida so we filled in the forms for another carrier...and that day Cigna announced the, too, were not continuing with small groups. Then we went to BCBS of Florida and they are just slower than you can ever imagine. (I think the heat in Florida makes things go slower than up north). Anyway, we don't qualify for COBRA and the state insurance won't kick in until you've been without insurance coverage for at least 6 months. DUH...I'm trapped. And, to make things worse, this isn't covered by the insurance commissioner but comes under the department of labor. Self insurance plans are just nuts. Never get involved in one if you can avoid it. Being self-employed, I was looking for less expensive coverage that the $800/month I was paying. I got htis plan for just under $500/month. Then last fall it jumped to nearly $1700/month. Now they billed me the $500/month price but no coverage is forthcoming. UGH!  It's bureaucracy at it's worst. Oh, did I mention that the plan administrator is in Georgia? You all might not agree, but a national health insurance program could save lots of money and lots of lots time and lives.  The healthcare industry is just that...an industry. I just hate dealing with this and have no patience for it. Ok, rant over. Back to knitting.",

I think we have all struggled with emotional issues and the desire to strangle someone who carries on about trivial stuff. Thank goodness we have each other to vent to. Got to tell you guys about the latest thing a friend said that made my head spin. This friend makes an annual visit to Florida in March for about 10 days. This year the airfare was cheaper if she stayed a couple of days longer. So she made the reservation and then told her boss that she needed extra days off because her friend in Florida had breast cancer and needed her help! It's a good thing we were on the phone and not face-to-face or I would have strangled her! How dare she play the cancer card to get extra vacation time now when she didn't come last summer when my Mom was ill and I was still in chemo. I even offered to pay her airfare then! And...she had the summer off so it wasn't as though she needed to get permission or lose out on work then.  I'm really miffed but have to realize that throughout this ordeal I have learned a lot about myself and the people I know. Some of what I've learned, I like. Much of what I learned is disappointing.",

We have been through 'thick and thin' (I am now a lot thicker than I am thin thanks to steroids and inactivity, plus that chocolate keeps calling my name) and we're still coming together to discuss out feelings, our hopes, our fears, our triumphs and our disappointments, our delights. I really value these friendships more than you will ever know. Maybe the whole thing about being done with cancer or being done with this cancer is just as simple as DMom's son says it is...we have taken care of it and it's gone. Or we hope it is. Dwelling on the 'what if's' is what gets me in trouble. It's gone for now. Hoping it never comes back...like the bad penny or the bad boyfriend (or Richard that rat bastard may he rot in hell)...something we never want to see or hear about again. \"Out, out damn spot..., out, out damn cancer.\" We worry but we try not to and we try especially hard not to show people around us that we are still fearful. So we tell each other and we feel better. At least I do, knowing that I can talk it all out with you. So tell me, did anyone ever figure out what date the 'cancerversary' is and why in heck it's celebrated? I was told last year on March 11th that I had a malignancy. The radiologist wrote that on the mammo/ultrasound report and I had to go to my primary nurse practitioner to hear the words. So I keep saying that was the date of discovery, a good 6 weeks before the biopsy and 10 weeks before the surgery. What date is celebrated and why? The day you were told so you could get on with the fight? The date you had the surgery to get the damn stuff out? Does it matter? Ah, but I digress...I guess I just don't get the celebratory aspect of any of this. The only good thing that I think that's happened to me through all this is you. Tina, yes, I have had Herceptin from the beginning and will have it for 1 year so should be done in this June. I hadn't had any real trouble other than more fatigue and the mention that it will make my hair regrowth slower (dang) but yesterday they phoned to say that the bloodwork drawn before last week's infusion shows I have developed a low potassium, in spite of taking extra potassium tablets every day.  Could be the Herceptin, could be the freaking thyroid thing they're 'watching'. The fatigue is real because of the decreased ejection fraction. Mine was at 50 back in December. I am thankful everyday that I get to have Herceptin but I'm respectful of it's potential dangers, too. Nothing is perfect, is it? Wishing everyone is feeling a bit more hopeful now that there are some signs of Spring! Hugs all around. Bon",

The insurance issue isn't so simple. I get insurance through a small group and it's not covered under the auspices of the Insurance Commission, but under the Dept. of Labor. I am an 'employee' and as such the company has a contract with the group, not individuals. If the group goes down, we all go down. It's a mess...I real quagmire and I have to let the company fight them, not me personally. Also have to be careful as to not lose all insurance coverage. Tightrope walking 101.   I say 'heck, yes' to someplace in Florida if you are all game. Just remember that it will be cold in the Panhandle until about April. Snow birds seem to go away at Easter time and maybe there are rental deals in May there. I know agents in Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, Panama City...we jsut have to get there before Spring Break!  Or we could go anywhere in Florida really. I know Hawaii sounds better, right? I can't worry about insurance today. I'll think about something more pleasant...like a colonoscopy!  Drowning in cat fur balls so must get cleaning NOW.",

I am thrilled for those of you who have gone through this ordeal with thouroughly supportive spouses by your side. And for those who have struggled with less than in-tune mates or no one at all... We've all come through to the other side and won't forget who did and did not make our burden a bit lighter. I serendipidously ender a iong term, long distance relationship just a few weeks before the fateful dx, and can honestly say that it has been better to do this journey by myself, than having to worry about his feelings and emotions during my treatments. There are worse things than being alone...and the biggest one I can think of is being tied to someone who just doesn't 'get it'.",

She is still pretty weak, as is to be expected, but she's happy to be home and eager to get her life back, too. They never did get the diarrhea totally under control and she is still on lomotil tid, as well as 30 mgs of prednisone. That's a whopping dose of steroids, especially for such a small person.  But the colon in still inflamed and they are trying to get that resolved.  I drafted a very specific list for her of what she can and cannot eat over this short haul, and will work with her GI doc to reintroduce other foods over time. Last night I had to make her a spreadsheet for all the various meds they have her on, since they've added a couple with odd timing requirements and taken others away from her usual routine.  It got pretty complicated, even for me. Imagine being almost 89, weary from the entire ordeal, and being shipped off to home without specific and clear instructions on diet and meds!  Nursing care was great...rest of it was just below bad. That dietitian was just out of her element when faced with more than two dietary restrictions...for dinner last evening they sent up a lovely piece of salmon with a topping of fresh diced tomato, onions, and capers!  SSSSSCCCCCRRRREEEAAAAMMMM!  At least Mom was smart enough to scrape off that stuff and just eat the fish. But making patients virtually fend for themselves against the dietary department makes no sense. Wish I had a dietary degree...I know I could teach them a thing or two, and maybe prevent this type of screw-up from happening to other patients. (Ha, Ha...spell-check is so used to my screams, it didn't even question the long one above!) Anyway, she is home and now that I am done with chemo and past the worst SE (I hope) of the last round, I'll be able to help her some. I thank each and every one of you for indulging me over this last 8 or so days when I was just terrified for her...and for me. Thank you for your prayers, good wishes and patience. And Mom thanks you, too.   Bon",

That's why docs now give Neulasta within 24 hrs of the Taxotere, to keep those cells up and avoid what happened to you. And that's also the reason they don't want us taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory because they don't want to mask any fevers that might crop up. Glad they caught it in time and that you are now on the mend. After this, your other tx will be a breeze!  All the best to you. ",

I went for a blood count and when they saw my WBC had dropped so much, they gave me the Neulasta right away. By the next time I had chemo two weeks later, my WBC was back up to 14 and it never tanked again. I had my radiation oncology consult today. I'll be going for the staging where they make the 'mold' and mark my skin on the 17th and start the treatments sometime the week after. I'll have 33 treatments over time. The goal is 6and 1/2 weeks but the RO said it doesn't matter if it takes longer. That gives me some latitude if I need to deal with something for my Mom one day or have a client that I really need to work with then and not later. He said the two universal SEs are fatigue and burning of the skin and he recommends using aloe to keep the skin moist starting now. The one thing they don't want is for patients to be on extra Vitamin C or E...something about too many antioxidants and radiation causing free radicals.  One possible SE that I didn't like to hear about was lymphedema of the breast, not the arm. He says it's rare but they have to let everyone know it's possible. And he said that all consent forms say there can be broken ribs but that he has never seen that, ever. The way this tx is done is lying on my back with my arms raised, elbows up and out and hands over my head.  It isn't done lying on my stomach with the breast hanging through a hole in the table. The tx themselves only take a few minutes each time and the whole breast will be radiated. The last few will be the booster ones you hear about and will concentrate on the area where the tumor was. I've chosen to have the tx at a satellite facility that's only 35 or 40 minutes away vs. the main cancer center that's 75 to 90 minutes depending upon traffic. Being closer is better when you have to do it every weekday for 6 and 1/2 weeks and still try to work. I like the RO, he has a good, easy manner and is very easy to talk to. That's more than half the battle. And he comes with glowing recommendations from my BS whom I adore.  So I'm on my way to a new adventure....I'll keep you posted and will be interested to see what your RO says when you get another appointment.",

Took about an hour total. I'll be starting the first of 33 tx on Tuesday at 1:30.  I had my 5th Herceptin tx on Wednesday, the first one on it's own, without chemo, and have had no SEs from it at all. Herceptin is a wonder drug, according to each of my docs, so I'm happy to be receiving it. I've only posted a few times recently because I'm trying to work and my Mom is not well again...still. She's home but failing and the prednisone has messed with the blood sugar so much that they have put her on insulin. Imagine being nearly 89 and having to learn how to deal with blood glucose meters and readings and food issues...all on top of everything else she's dealing with.. The whole family is stressed to the absolute max. Anyway, it's the weekend and I hope all of you who have finished chemo are doing the happy dance to have that behind you. And for all still going to chemo tx...we're here cheering you on and across that finish line. Hope everyone has a stress and SE free weekend.",

Don't push yourself too much and remember that the chemo SEs are only temporary.  You can look at the board I started back in June before I began with chemo. It's called 'I'm terrified of chemotherapy' and some really terrific women gave me lots of advice and tips. Then I found this board and found a terrific support group with these wonderful women who all started chemo in June 2010. Stay positive, Carrol. Chemo isn't easy or for sissies, but it's a life saver.",

Your trip though cancer hell has been far longer and more difficult than mine, but I do understand feeling as though you would not do it again if there is a 'do over'. I have begun to understand that the reason I'm being shuttled through pretty extensive radiation tx, even without having any nodes involved, is because I'm ER, PR negative. And my tumor size and placement put me at grade 3. My dear BS really was crestfallen when he saw that I was ER,PR negative. His only comment was \"at least you get to have Herceptin\". So it's better than being triple negative, but still not a good dx. It's an aggressive cancer and they seem to want to use every weapon in the arsenal to keep it from coming back. They have even recommended a hysterectomy to get rid of those ovaries and the uterus while they're at it, still not knowing my BRAC status. For me BRAC pos or neg might not matter as much as just getting the ovaries gone! Sherry, since you had cancer spill outside the wall of the effected node it seems like they want to use every weapon in their arsenal for you, too. I think that I understand chemo can kill most all the nasty cancer cells anywhere since it's going after new cell growth and cancer replicates so quickly. And the radiation is to protect against any 'rogue' cells that might have been able to mutate quicker than the chemo can work and still be in the tumor area. Sort of all seems like killing a fly with a bug spray and then finishing him off with gun fire. But it does make sense. It's just more of everything to deal with. More time, more SEs, more money, more doubt. I don't know what we are supposed to do except to trust our docs and try to make it through all the tx. I just keep remembering how astonished I was when first faced with the proposed treatment plan. I researched everything and quickly figured out that if the surgeries, chemo and radiation didn't kill me, I might indeed have a chance at being cancer free for awhile. I hate this disease and I hate that it's taken it's toll on all of us. Every day brings a new decision and new challenges. We can get through it but I know we will never be the same. I get that. You all get that. Most everyone else who hasn't been on this side of the boards doesn't really get that.",

I am so fortunate as to have had Neulasta after each Taxotere tx. It kept my WBC up the whole time. And my RBC didn't fall farther after tx #1. I learned while on Taxotere that the SE can appear at almost any time. That terrible rash I had started on day 12 after a tx (once every three weeks was my schedule) and the manufacturer of Taxotere side it was from their drug, even though my onc didn't think it was possible after so many days. Taxanes are nasty...maybe lifesavers, but still poison and their long lasting effects include the good and the bad. So could be that the aches and pains are really from cumulative effect of taxol. Actually, I am finally starting to understand that I have neuropathy in my feet. Yesterday I had a pedicure and honestly couldn't feel her working away on a terrible callous.  She kept asking if it hurt and I to say that it didn't. I wasn't willing to say that I couldn't feel anything at all. I do have twinges of pain when walking...feels like pebbles in my shoes and electric shock all at once. And that's 5 weeks after the last chemo! I've known about the neuropathy in the area of my scar where the nodes were removed during surgery...and near my port. This week when the BS massaged that port area to break up scar tissue, I almost jumped off the exam table in pain. But there are areas right around that port where I can't feel a thing. While I was waiting to see the BS on Thursday afternoon in a packed waiting room, I met a lovely woman who is 10 yrs NED.  She was very encouraging and told me how she was going through this at a time when it was std. procedure to do chemo, rads, and then more chemo. She said how terribly sick the Adriamycin made her but that the Taxol was the worst for her. She remembered it like yesterday but said how she really doesn't think about it every day now and has been able to reclaim her life. In fact, one of the things he did while in treatment was to make a 'bucket list' and she made good on some of her dreams...one of which was to open a bathing suit store where she specializes in suits to fit women with different breast sizes and mastectomies. She is very successful here in sunny Florida...partly because of the need for that and I'm sure, partly because of how genuinely lovely she is to everyone. So....my bucket list items fall far short of that type of goal, but still, I'm trying to get myself to realize that this is all there is and I need to make the best of the rest of it,  My hopes for a positive weekend for you all.

Hooray! VickyThomas...Happy Birthday!  Hope you get to have your favorite things surrounding by your favorite people. Latte...what a decision you have to deal with! It's nice that you have a choice but then again, it really does cause you more stress. I am humbled when I read what the women who have had MX and RECONX go through. Maybe there is a board on this website that deals with 'either/or' questions or you could start one. Seems like its a mighty big decision because the preparation, surgeries, and recovery are so involved. We'll all be pulling for you whatever you decide. Today I missed a rads tx. Last week the tech told me I would have to change my appointment time from 10:15 today to 1:30 to accommodate the RO schedule and for them to do whatever extra measurements were necessary for the 7 boosts. Those don't start until after #26 and today would have been #16. So I rearranged my clients and got myself to the rads center (40 minute drive each way) by 1:25 only to be told I was early.When I said \"only 5 minutes\", they told me that my appointment wasn't until 2:15. I hadn't slept well, am more tired than I have ever been, was showing  property this morning from 9-12:15 and made the mad dash down there and just couldn't deal with THEIR error. So I flipped out!  I said that I didn't feel well enough to wait 45 minutes for a procedure that would take 45 minutes and I would just forget about a tx today.  I saw the RO right away, he said my skin is fine and just keep using the aloe, go rest and see you later, bye. SOOOO, I'll have to add a day on at the end and now won't be done until November 5th. But I just couldn't deal with being kept waiting...I don't dare be 5 minutes late there and then they wanted me to wait 45 minutes? No way. Guess I'm just over being a patient patient. Am going to bed early. Tomorrow is another day.",

When I got there they said they need to do x-rays too. (I get that every 5 or so tx). So I got positioned and ready to go...and the x-ray componenet of the machine wasn't functioning. Great!  I did get my tx and they said they would do the x-rays tomorrow. But it makes me wonder about being zapped and the safety issues. Yesterday someone sent me  an email about the dangers of microwaved water and how it kills plants and that microwaved food is killing brain cells. I got all concerned and then I thought \"crap...I'm letting them fry me with radiation every day\".  How much worse can microwaved stuff be? TMarina...yep, positioning me in the form and the equipment set up is what takes the time with this rads stuff. The tx themselves are zip, zip...I get 4 zaps of about 15 seconds each. The machine readjusts it's angles in between each zap. I walk in the lobby, get changed, go to the table, get zapped, get redressed and leave, all within 15 to 20 minutes at the most.   Sherry9316...Hope you're feeling better every day. DesignerMom...Your first rads tx is tomorrow. I'm sure all will go well and that you'll find it a good change from the tedium of chemo. The new ABC club...anything but chemo!

Forecast if for 27F tonight...and that's here on the east coast of south central Florida!  We have fire warnings because it's been so dry and windy, freeze warnings, and wind chill warnings!  Imagine that! I hope you all can snuggle in today, enjoy the holiday lights and eat the leftover goodies. Christmas skipped my house because I have been miserably ill with a cold/flu for days now. Probably picked it up when I was in the hospital for 12 hours for that dang heart cath (which, by the way, came out fine but did show that my ejection fraction is down to 50%).  I was supposed to be the one entertaining and cooking dinner...but it just wasn't meant to be. Thought I could postpone it for today but am not up to par yet and no need to rush it. Everyone had a fine day yesterday without the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  I just enjoyed the tree lights and watched bad movies all day. Am so congested that I can't even smell the Vicks Vaporub! Nor can I taste the cough syrup. I figure I will know when I'm better when my sense of smell returns. I haven't been posting much since I've been feeling so rotten and didn't have much positive energy to spare. But I've read the posts that come in and it's so nice to be in touch with you all. Looks like most all had a lovely Christmas, except for Latte. But her present is rads, right. I keep trying to tell myself that all the money I had to spend over and above what my insurance paid was a gift to myself. And Ginny, you keep me entertained with tales of Julia and your family. It must be so incredible to have a large and loving family to gather with for holidays and special occasions. I am an only child of an only child and my only blood related cousin died this August. So I read about everyone's family get-togethers and smile. Sounds like joyful chaos. Tina, I'm glad you have some time off and that your kids and grandkids have given you such delight. And Joan, I'm happy you had a good time with family yesterday and hope your sister isn't delayed in getting to you today. But if it's a nasty day outside, you're safe and warm inside. Aren't you glad for those leftover Christmas cookies?  Joan, I think most all of us had a bit of a shudder over the last few days, grateful that we are here at Christmastime and frightened about the future. I don't think it would be normal otherwise. It's like PTSD...the stress after the trauma will take a while to dissipate. Hope you can just concentrate on looking forward and going into 2011 with HOPE. And DMom, well, you know I love you, but that hillbilly stuff was dreadful! A 'shout out' to Carolyn, Danielas, Toni...and to Kitty and Chey who I hope are off enjoying the holidays to the fullest. And to Sherry...I hope you've had some pain relief, renewed strength, and enjoyment of the season. Please know that we think of you and are praying the biopsy is fast and negative. If I skipped anyone, my sincere apologies. It's the dextromethorphan in the cough syrup and lack of oxygen!. Love and hugs to you all.  Bon",

Both of them are better trained with lumps and bumps than some drug pushing medical oncologist. I swear if I could get to the people who set the appointments I'd rip their hearts out...you can be sure that not one of them has had a bc dx and had to undergo what you've been through. They just follow orders blindly...but not knowing what it's like to be on this side of the fence. And if you need me to make that appointment for you...you know that DMom and I can be pitbulls when we need to be...I will do it. Send me a PM with the details and I'll call those suckers. Chey, while you are in tears I am in rage. Do not let them bring you down. Suck it up for the weekend and then go elsewhere. My BS and RO are far better at bedside manner and more understanding than my MO ever thought of being. He makes money giving chemo. they have more hands-on with the patients. It irks me that I have to deal with my MO...he is the one who charged me fully for my Herceptin in January when my insurance was only paying 2/3 of that fee. I say skip that sucker and get the BS to see you as a follow up. No breast cancer surgeon worth their salt wants a woman loose out there crying over a lump. Hang in, Chey. we will get your back. Always. We have been through too much together to let some snotty doctor's receptionist or horrible medical practice get you down. Hugs, Bon",

Just trying to keep looking forward and not backwards...and keeping a positive attitude amid this craziness. I am not preaching politics, just noting that we desperately need some type of insurance reform. Did you know that insurance companies have 30 days to notify docs that they are withdrawing coverage retroactively and they have a year to take back the money paid out? So even when they confirm your insurance with the docs and hospitals and give the A-OK for service, they can renege and take it all back? UGH...DMom...keep that soundproof room warmed up. I'm in need of a long, long primal scream. Today is my birthday and I am getting ready to go for another Herceptin infusion.

Your energy, enthusiasm and problem-solving skills will help you move into a leadership position. Your popularity will grow based on your contributions. Discipline and hard work will pay off. You can overcome anything you put your mind to right now, so stop procrastinating and start your journey down a path that can lead to a better future. So my new mantra is I DESERVE BETTER!  Ladies, we all deserve better!  Onward and upward...and off to the oncology center. Herceptin is my birthday gift to myself. Hugs to all...Bon",

DMom...I think we've all had trouble in dealing with what comes next...the next drug, next scan, next surgery, or nothing at all. It's so difficult to know what the right thing is to do, how to do it and how to get through it.  I keep trying not to dwell on the past year and look ahead...but my crystal ball is cloudy and I am having a difficult time making any kind of plans. Not just plans for medical stuff, but plans for life. There is a wonderful Yiddish expression that when translated means 'Man thinks and God laughs'. I've also heard it as 'Want to see God laugh? Make a plan.'  I have become less structured with my calendar and more 'take it as it comes' in my approach to things right now. Which is probably why I find myself with piles of paper and dust an inch thick all over the house. And I have that house guest arriving next Thursday...UGH, more vacuuming with pearls later today.

Sandiddstn...Glad you got out in the sun, soaked up some vitamin D, and probably felt invigorated, too. I stopped the other day long enough to let the sun beat on my face for a couple of minutes and it gave me an energy and mood boost. I just have to see the sun to feel alive. Probably because I grew up in a place where it almost never shone. I an a transplant to Florida for that very reason. Sunshine is a wonderful thing. Toni...I was supposed to have a colonoscopy before all this BC stuff started so now I know there is one just around the corner for me. The fun never stops! Ginny...sounds just like you to 'adopt' an older woman in crisis who is all alone. I pray for blessings to you for your kindnesses and to her for a painless future, whatever it will be and for however long. It isn't fair to be that old and have to deal with this bc #%*@.

I do read the posts and just am sometimes overwhelmed between work, fighting with insurance companies and trying to 'pay it forward' or even paying back friends who helped me so much last year. Update from my side: UHC has demanded refund from ONC, radiologist and cardiologist and Hospital where my heart cath was done in December. They gave the OK, then later on, in January, said coverage ceased on 12/1, not 1/1...so over $50k in bills will be mine! Now you see why I think I can't pay for a trip to Hawaii?  On Wednesday I sat with my friend who had her BMX that day and they had to keep her in an extra day due to a leaking vein which caused blood to build up in the breast area. Had to use compression to get swelling down and bleeding to stop. Now they are weaning her off IV pain meds but she is snowed with oral pain meds and benadryl plus sleep meds. Too much...she wants no pain at all, not one twinge. I don't think that's possible with bmx but she has to climb that part of the mountain herself, My high school friend is having her surgery next Wednesday, the 9th. Feel surrounded by bc right now. I hate having new women enter our 'club'. I sure didn't want to be here but if I had to do this journey, I am sincerely glad that I got to do it with each of you.  HUGS ALL AROUND!  Bon",

It wouldn't be complete without you...I have been using skype to keep a few friend updated on my hair growth. Of course they are close friends because skype is best utilized in pj's and with the first cup of coffee for the day. Ladies, I have been reading your discussion about Arimidex and Tamoxifen with great interest. Since my cancer was ER-, PR-, neither of those is recommended for me. I'm sure it's a tough decision whether to take these drugs for such a long term, especially after all we've been through already, and because we know for certain that nothing is 100% and SEs are possible with every tx. I do know people who are currently on one of those you are discussing and women who have been on them and are done with the long haul. Also know people who stopped after a few years and others who have been on tamoxifen well over 5 years. Not one has told me of any terrible SEs from them yet. But everyone is in a different place with menopause and their emotions so each experience is different, isn't it. One of the doctors told me that Tamoxifen and Arimidex were that little extra step to actively work toward keeping a recurrence at bay. Then he said, \"oh, you can't take that'\" But I do get the Herceptin because it was HER2+ and that's supposed to be a great benefit. Wow, does this bc stuff never end?  ",

I'm a delicate hot-house flower now and don't take much to colder weather. But the offer from my friend for the cabin in NC was a lovely gesture and I needed to put that out there for us to discuss. He is still reeling from the death of his wife from bc and will do anything for us that he can, having gone through this hellish experience with her to the end. Do you think that the time-share condo could hold enough of us over those few days? Or could we get another one at a good price so we can all stay in the same place? In which facilities are they located? Maybe we can find someone with a timeshare in one of those places willing to donate it to us, too.  I am here in Florida already so my main focus is to get to know you all in person but having the theme parks or beaches can't be bad. Both Orlando or Fort Lauderdale have an easily accessible airport.",

Wearing my big hoop earrings helps. The wig I got is OK but I particularly like the baseball cap with longish hair attached.Can even put that in a ponytail. Looks a bit more real and fits snuggly so won't blow off in the wind. I call it Brett because I think Brett Michaels has hair attached to his bandannas. Trusting, how did it go for you?

Radiologists is one of those groups. I've heard more horror stories about radiologists comments before, during and after biopsies than I can possibly say here. I was fortunate. My BS did the ultrasounds and biopsy in his office. He does them himself.

It would be nice if we could protect everyone we love, and even those we don't, from having to deal with bc (or any cancer for that matter). But, alas, that isn't how the cosmic forces work.  The best we can do is to honor those who've been lost and warn the rest about the need for early detection,  Mammograms, ultrasounds, self exams...all of it.  It might not be perfect, but it's all we've got for now...until the cure!  Carrol and Joan...I sympathize with you about elder care and await my turn with trepidation.  As an only child of an only child and a step-Dad without any children of his own, I will be faced with being the caretaker at some point, too.  I love them dearly and am so fortunate to have them in my life at my 'advanced' age.  I pray that things work our for your families and that you have the strength and stamina to do what must be done for your parents.  And that you retain a sense of humor.  Ginny has shown us through the antics of Julia that a sense of humor is required! I wanted to share more good news with you all, my sisters...My txs are over!  My last Herceptin IV ended yesterday at 1PM and I am DONE!!! (Over done, some would say...but done, nonetheless!!!) My chemo began June 23,2010 and the Herceptin ended June 22, 2011...one full year! We have been through so much together...tears and triumphs. I could never have done this without you and am so happy to be sharing the victory with you. Some day soon I hope to awaken and not have cancer be the first thing I think of. I am committed to getting on with life...as soon as I get the port out, have a hysterectomy and a colonoscopy!  Just more 'stuff' to do. Thinking positive. Wishing you all a wonderful day!  And sending a great big THANK YOU!  Hugs...Bon ",

I had chest pain a couple of weeks ago after my 2nd TCH tx and a Neulasta injection 24 hrs later. Onc did tell me then that the chest pain is more pronounced in women and that it isn't unusual at all for 30% of patients to end up in the ER. He didn't say not to go, just that I shouldn't be to alarmed if it happened and to be aware of it's ebbs and flows. Of course, this is the same guy who doesn't believe that my rash is a SE of the Taxotare so who knows how valid his observation is on chest pain. Ladies, it's a miracle that we all survive this poison being injected into our veins. But somehow we do. I sometimes think how incredibly brave or stupid the first chemo patients must have been to let themselves be used in trials of all the early drugs and even the drugs we're taking now. The will to live is so strong. So, here we are, sick and tired, both literally and figuratively, and still we come back for another round. I raise my water glass high in salute to all of us, all who went before us and all who,unfortunately, will follow us on this path to be cancer free.  Hell and well rhyme. Seems like we have to go through one to get to the other. Hope you all have a SE free weekend. I have a friend who came up from the Keys for a few days and right now she is doing my vacuuming. Not that's what I call a friend and the start of a good weekend!  Bon PS/ this is my 4th day of Prednisone and the rash is subsiding. Not completely gone but it will be history soon. The manufacturer filed it as an 'incident'. I assume it's just a side effect, not a full blown allergic reaction to the Taxotare. But they do recommend a reduced dosage and vigilance during the next infusion on Wednesday.",

The literature I saw says that both are acceptable treatments. I am on Taxotere and did not get any Adriamycin regimen prior to that. Just Taxotere and Cytoxan. I see that many of the women here are on Taxol after completing a first regimen of other chemos. Can't tell why the difference in treatment except that my tumor was ER,PR negative and HER2+ so maybe that is what accounts for the choice of drug. Taxol says it's given weekly and Taxotere is every three weeks. I was freaked initially that I wasn't getting enough broad-base coverage and even asked my MO yesterday before what was my last round of chemo if I needed to have additional chemo to get better insurance against recurrence. He said no. So I just have to take a deep breath and hope it was right for my situation.I think that my medical background and reading too much just has me freaked some days and my mind runs the what if route straight to hell. To all sending prayers to my Mom...thank you so much. I am really scared for her and hate to see her suffering like this. When we talked this morning she once again apologized to me for causing me worry. Can you imagine? I suppose you might have figured out that I am an old Mama's girl...and only child of an only child. This is very difficult for both of us. Thank God that my step-Dad is such a great guy and that I have a dear friend who got up in the middle of the night and drove to the hospital to be with them through the admitting process and until Mom was comfortably in her room by 4:30AM. ",

I dragged myself to the hospital at 6:15 this morning to get there for my Mom's physicians rounds.  Finally got to speak face-to-face with both GI and PCP to articulate my concerns about her needs. We have finally established that she is improved but only slightly and the diagnosis is murky at best. They had agreed not to move her to a nursing or rehab facility until her condition improved quite a bit more or they had a more definite plan for treatment BUT just now Mom phoned to say a social worker walked in and told her they are making arrangements to send her to a rehab center. So at the moment I have a sick Mom in a hospital cross town who is in tears and a friend in her way back there to see if she can sort it out. I am still confronted with the nausea and wobbles of my latest chemo 6 days ago and can barely hold it together long enough to type this, so can't manage to get back to the hospital right now.  Cancer is challenging enough and this added worry for my Mom is just the topper. I'm sooooo frustrated. No one seems to know what the other is doing.  Does no one in the medical community listen?  Bon",

And, here's the latest on the Mom front...the chief hospital dietitian brought my Mom a dinner tonight that she had personally chosen to comply with the multiple dietary restrictions Mom is facing as the docs try to figure out what to do next. Not only are they trying to eliminate gluten and lactose, but they have specified low residue (ala, no fiber, lots of white, plain stuff) and they are watching the sugar and salt intake, too. Makes it pretty difficult to find much that she can eat. So what does this sterling professional give her?  Roast chicken with peas and carrots!  Peas to a woman who is having diarrhea 8 times a day!  So tonight the peas made it 9.  I swear I have to rescue her from these incompetents. I bet even your kids and grandkids know that if their tummy isn't well, peas wouldn't be a good choice.  A dietitian, no less. Wonder where her degree is from? I so wish I had been there when the tray was delivered. That dietitian would have been wearing those peas. I'm with D'Mom...tomorrow let's all pretend we never heard the word cancer...at least for one day. ",

You know, a few weeks back I was resenting a friend who phones me every day from 1200 miles away. She rattles on about her daily activities, her travels, her plans. I found myself being angry that she was having a life and I am having cancer. Then I realized that I told everyone early on that I wanted them to tell me about their good stuff because I needed to live vicariously this summer. I mean, phoning me and getting on my pity-me bus wasn't going to help me get through the rough spots...I wanted good things to focus on and I got them. Right now I just say 'thank you' to whatever someone says about my appearance or my chances of a full recovery. This week someone even commented on my \"cute little round face from the steroids\".   It doesn't matter what they say...it matters how I feel and I'm trying to feel strong and determined. My prize at the end of this cancer stuff is getting back a life that doesn't revolve around doctors and tx and meds.

It's nice to see that light at the end of the tunnel. Since finishing chemo I've noticed that the nosebleeds have stopped, my nails stripes are more noticeable and I'm very, very tired. My white counts are back in the normal range, after being sky-high from the steroids and Neulasta, so I've gotten a little sniffle, too. Am trying to avoid any illness because I want to get a flu shot when I go for Herceptin in two weeks. I had first rads tx today. Got 5 more little tattoo dots, too, so the total is now 8.  It took far longer to drive there and back than it did to get positioned, measured, remarked, and zapped this first time. I have a 35-45 minute drive each way and have been told the rest of my visits there will be brief...like 15 minutes. So I'm scheduled for the next 32 week days at 10:15. That way I can avoid school bus and commuter traffic and be at work by noon. Great news for those who's tumors have shrunk! Hooray for you.  And congrats to anyone who is getting hair growth. I must say that's it's pretty darn easy to get ready in the mornings when you're bald, but having hair again would be nice. I don't know if I'll ever cut it once it grows back. I think I'll just become one of those old women with long gray hair in a bun. NorthernGirl...wishing you all the best for 24 more!",

I'm sure your frustration is immeasurable.  I'm now a month past last chemo and noticing things that have improved or not so great things that have comeback...like that pesky post-nasal drip. It's just amazing to me that chemo stopped it cold and now that my body is recovering from the chemo and the new cells can grow again, back comes PND. That is truly something I could have done without forever. Today after my 5th radiation tx I saw the RO and described to him the shooting pains I'm getting in the bottom half of the treated breast and the ache under my arm where the nodes were removed. He poked and prodded, sometimes pressing deep into my ribs, and then told me that the pains are a sign of early inflammation of the chest wall and breast tissue due to the radiation. It's a bit early for it to start, but it's real. He told me to take OTC anti-inflammatory for the pain, to only wear a sports bra and to keep the breast supported, not to lift anything heavier than 5 lbs with that arm (my right), and to massage the area regularly. So, there you have it. After only 4 rads tx the SEs started appearing. I've got 28 more to go. Not sure if rads tx is going to be less traumatic than chemo or not. It's an odd feeling to be lying on a metal mesh table with huge machinery going back and forth over you, listening to the timer click off seconds, and imagining what this radiation can be doing to you, besides the original focus of eradicating the possibility of recurring cancer in that area. Scary stuff, this.",

Nice that TX has another meaning besides \"tx for treatment\".  Enjoy yourself to the max! Am now on 4 meds for cough and congestion. Primary ARNP isn't convinced that the whole thin didn't start with rads tx but she is handing it and even did an EKG because my pulse was high.

Here's hoping the the rest of your travels go more smoothly and you don't get the extra pat-downs. And great about your hair. Wish I could say the same. It's two months after my last chmeo and I've got some fuzz but nothing to brag about yet. Latte...  Great News! You must be relieved.  And Kittycat and Sherry...NO MORE CHEMO!!! YIPPEE!!!  You've each been through so much and have been inspirational in your handling of it all. So happy that you're done and can move on. D'Mom...Did I read that correctly? You walked the 40, that's f-o-r-t-y, blocks to your rads appointment?  Well, Good for you!  But it makes me weak just thinking of it. I'm currently pretty sore and tired and can hardly make it 40 feet some days, so 40 blocks sounds like a marathon to me! JFV and TMarina and Chey...you sound like things are looking up. Hope you're feeling as well as your posts read. Finished 26 regular rads tx and 2 boosts.  5 more boosts. The lead shield they made for the boosts really has me wonder what this radiation stuff is doing to me.  My skin has held up pretty well but some redness, a couple of sores and occasional mild shooting pains in the breast. Next Friday can't some fast enough!  I am so over this daily rads part of tx. The cough and congestion continue and the wasp sting caused enough swelling for the RO to be concerned now about lymphedema, so he is watching it all closely. He's really pretty comprehensive and thorough. I actually think he's better than my MO. Funny how different the docs in my 'team' all are. Got my 7th Herceptin IV on Wednesday. I keep hoping that it's the miracle drug all the docs say it is.  Stress echo-cardiogram scheduled for Nov.15 and then I have to talk to GYN about an oophorectomy, Would like to get it all done in 2010 while my deductibles are paid and I'm in the doctor mill. I really want 2011 to be less medically oriented.   Sorry that this post sounds whiny. I think I'm just tired and overwhelmed because our company is going franchise on Monday so I've got all new cards and signs to get printed, notifications to make, websites to change, and 'miles to go before I sleep'.  It's just a huge undertaking and a real reminder that the world goes on whether I have cancer or not.  Well, la de da! Hope you all have a good weekend.  Bon",

You may develop a rash that looks like a blotchy, hive-like reaction. This usually occurs on the hands and feet but also may appear on the arms, face or other areas of the body. Generally a rash will appear between treatments and will go away before your next Taxotere® treatment.

And Danielle and Janny, I ended a long distance long term relationship in January and was diagnosed with BC in March by mammogram and April by biopsy. I have never regretted kicking that guy to the curb for one minute. I got tired of worrying about his practice or his grown sons issues. His stuff. I wasn't going to move there and he wasn't going to move here. It was time. Yes, it is tough going through this stuff alone. But I have been blessed with a wonderful array of friends, some whom I've probably known longer than you are old. And I get support and understanding from them without reservation. Whether near or far, there is always someone to talk to or lean on. My good old girl friends will get me through this. I feel freedom to do as I please and to take charge of my life. This a time I need to focus on me. It IS all about me now. I can't be worrying about his issues or trying to make him feel better.. He kept calling for a couple of months and I never did tell him about the BC. I just asked that he please leave me alone. I had to be blunt. And the PS here is that I don't think that if we had still been together when I was diagnosed that he would have been able to handle it very well. I imagine that I would have had to console him and tell him it will be OK. What a load of crap.

Tomorrow you will hopefully be able to speak to the new onc and get some reassurance. She knows of your past experience and reactions and if she's worth her salt, she will be on the lookout for anything and everything during this next infusion. Try to spend the next 24 hours thinking of the best outcome...completing chemo and being cancer free! That's the goal we all have. We'll all do whatever we can to help you get there.",

Have friend here who will be my chauffeur today and I can get some work done before she leaves tomorrow. Have to call oncs office later, fight my way through Brunhilda, and find out what to do about double steroids for tomorrow. I'm still on the 12 day regimen of Prednisone and am supposed to start Decadron tomorrow. YIKES, on both I'll be climbing the walls. Already I can't sleep or focus, am jittery, and eating everything that isn't nailed down. Are 8 meals a day too many? By the time I'm done with chemo I'll be the size of a house.

I have been a true Nervous Nellie, waiting to hear from Sherry and to know that she and Chey were doing OK again. (So glad to hear that you're on the mend, Sherry. You have been though so much. I hope it's smooth sailing for you from now on. And, Chey it's great that you are staying positive and having some laughs with your sister.)  I felt like the Mom who can't go to bed unless all the kids are home for the night. I'm pretty bonded to you all and take to heart each of your successes and set backs. So I'm happy that we all seem to be doing well today and that we're on the far side of this tx journey. I love Ginny's stories of Julia's antics and am so glad that she shares them with us. To face the situation with love and humor is heartwarming.  And all your tales of hair dying makes me smile, too.  Joan is going in public without her scarf. Tina's finished at least 21 rads tx by now and Kitty should have started hers. So should Liz.  Mimi should be done any day now. Jackie survived the TSA. We're moving on. How great is that?! I hosted Thanksgiving Day dinner and went without a wig the whole day. Then yesterday I traveled to a friend's post-Thanksgiving family gathering and took the wig off after an hour. So today I braved it to the grocery store without any headcover and it was fine. My super-short white and black fuzz is OK for now. I had a stress echo-cardiogram about 10 days ago and thought everything must have been OK since they didn't cart me off in a hearse or ambulance. But they found 'something' and want to talk with me on Tuesday. I figure it can't be anything too awful or they wouldn't have waited until then. I'm just so tired of medical appointments. This week on Tuesday I had to get to the ophthalmologist because somehow I scratched my right cornea. Yes, as Rosanne Rosannadanna would say \"I'ts always something\". So, my dear friends, I wish you the best and hope that we'll all continue to do well. We've come a long way...and I think you're all 'brilliant'. (That's for you, DMom. Now you've been called brilliant more than once!) Hugs all around. Bon",

I learned that that my best friend from college died last week after battling a recurrence of breast cancer. She had been clear for  5 or 6 years and then something went terribly wrong. I am inconsolable because I didn't get to see her last year in October when I was supposed to attend a wedding up north. She was still OK then and we had plans to reune over a glass of champagne. But business called and I didn't attend the wedding, nor get to see Carolyn. I'm not sharing this with you to bring you down, nor to make you fearful for your future. Please know that I've struggled with this news alone for a few days and just finally wanted to tell you so that I can stress the need to ENJOY YOUR LIFE!  Go do whatever will make you smile. Don't put off anything until tomorrow if you can possibly do it today. I don't have another chance now to see Carolyn's smiling face or to reminisce with her about our misspent college days and the early years after when we roamed the northeast together with happy hearts and high hopes. I've lost the one person in my life who shared those memories with me and would laugh at our adventures. Heck, she even saved me from a serial rapist...she was visiting me for a week and sound asleep when a guy with a knife broke into my attic flat. She awoke upon hearing him talking to me and she made a loud gasping sound. Since he thought he had a young girl alone, he was stunned to hear her and backed away from my bed, knife drawn, demanding to see us one at a time in the living room. That pause in his attack gave me enough composure to grab the alarm clock and heave it in his direction. He then fled and Carolyn and I both sat and cried. We were all of about 21 and absolutely earned our stripes as adults after that ordeal. Even though all of us on this site are struggling with our treatments and plodding through the days until we're NED, don't for one minute deprive yourself of any pleasure that is within your reach. Life is indeed too short. Carolyn left an adoring husband, 4 really terrific kids, and a vast eclectic assortment of friends. And she lived her life to the absolute fullest, enjoying the times she spent and the people she met along the way. I found a lovely Irish saying: 'Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. Love leaves a memory no one can steal.' My memories of Carolyn Jean Auburn Stultz are happy and joyous and loving. Forever. GO MAKE MORE WONDERFUL MEMORIES EVERYDAY!  Please.",

I've been reading your posts and my heart aches for all of you suffering the SEs of chemo.  I haven't written for awhile because I'm just not with it. I am not functioning normally and keep trying to readjust my focus. I am now a week post tx so the heavy steroids for the rash and then by mouth and IV with treatment should be worked out of my system by now. Sure hope so. This is undermining my spirit...I feel duller than dull. JFV...last night I drank a glass of skim milk and got back in bed. I swear it helped me finally catch a couple hours sleep. I've been taking niacin, calcium and magnesium at bedtime, too. Not certain that does anything but it is recommended, And, my suggestion for hot flashes is twofold...1) suck crushed ice; 2) roll a cold can of Pepsi (or any unopened cold aluminum can) on your wrists and up your arms to the inside of your elbow, and along your cheeks, neck and chest. It really helps to cut the heat and short circuit the 'power surge'.  Kittycat...I'm old enough to be your mother so here goes...TAKE THAT LEAVE! You have been through too much and have a lot to go...you can't risk your health for a job. I hope you are relaxing on your sofa, taking a much needed and deserved break. Sometimes being an overachiever is overrated. Am crawling back into my hole for another day. Hope to resurface soon, Wishing you all time in the NO SE zone.",

Kept doing that as though it was possessed. My computer guru spent 2 hrs and 38 minutes last night doing a remote log-in to fix the dang thing. Of course, 'dang' isn't the word I use for it but I can't post it like I speak it.

My group was dropped by United Health Care because they aren't covering small groups in Florida anymore. Then Cigna denied our application because they, too, have pulled out of Florida for small groups. We are waiting for BCBS of Florida to give us the OK but since they have no plan number or codes or cards or anything...well, just know that I am freaking because I won't be able to have my herceptin tx that is scheduled for tomorrow.  I keep telling myself not to worry because there really isn't anything I can do to control this. It's just such a mess. I didn't need this now. I have 6 months of herceptin to go and it's frightening to be hanging out here like this. Please keep your fingers crossed that this will resolve in the next few days and I can just shift the herceptin schedule by a week. I'll let you know when I know more. OK, enough complaining! We are great and we deserve a round of applause!  CLap, clap, clap, clap....and so on! Love to you all.  Bon",

Here in Florida, the sunshine is what keeps me going.  Latte, my cough is better but still gets me. It's worse when I talk a lot so it has succeeded in shutting me up for awhile. There are some people here who applaud that. This has been a bad week. No, Toni, my insurance didn't get worked out and I had to miss the Herceptin on Wednesday. Still not squared away so today I will be calling the financial person for the oncology group to see about self pay for one Herceptin IV next week. The bills I see to insurance are almost $7000 per IV. I can afford to pay for one or go into hock for two, but no more. I won't mortgage my house or go further in debt because of this. It was my biggest fear that breast cancer would sink me spiritually, physically, emotionally and financially. And here I am, OK with the spiritual and emotional stuff, and recovering from the physical assault, but now facing more fianancial hardship because of it. Remember, I paid thousands and thousands in 2010 because neither my breast surgeon, nor the anesthesia group at the hospital were covered by my insurance. And in business, if I don't work I don't get paid so I have to keep humping to keep all those plates spinning. This insurance thing has me reeling. Plus the 50-something wife of a colleague died on Monday from bc and my friend who works for us in the office on weekends was diagnosed Monday with both lobular and ductal cancer in the same breast. I went with her yesterday to the breast surgeon I used down south of here and he has her set for a bone scan, chest x-ray, blood work, MRI and EKG next week. Sadly, she is now one of us. I hate that. Thanks for letting me vent. And Jackie, sorry I didn't mention you last time I posted. I had a chemo-brain blip and couldn't remember a name. Does that happen to you all? It's getting worse for me, not better with time, and it has me worried. All of you in the snow...stay warm and be safe. I don't worry about DMom too much in this weather because she has her view of the park and can snuggle in. NY City is really great with just a bit of snow. And, DMom, I feel a need for another primal scream coming on. I may need that soundproof room soon. Or a padded cell! Hugs to all...Bon PS/ I've taken up knitting! I'm so hyperactive that I needed something to do while I veg out. Found 'fun fur' yarn and made a brown boa-wrap scarf in 3 days for my friend who went through all the initial steps of the bc dx with me. Yesterday while waiting with my friend in the surgeon's office I went through 7/8 of a skein on a new one...this time it's grey/beige/brown/yellow/white mixture. This morning I started on the 2nd skein. It will probably be done tomorrow. It's addicting when you're trying to keep your mind off things.",

I hope you get some relief soon. Please let me know what is prescribed.  I have a really arthritic hip and it has given me fits since the chemo.  And Kitty, my sincere condolences on the loss of your friend. It is so tough to lose friends at any age, but so young just doesn't seem fair. I know that I'm still reeling from the death of my college friend back in November. It doesn't seem real. And Chey...YOU GO GIRL!  We all have faith in you and you have faith in you...after what you've been through, seems like this talk will be a piece of cake!  Remember the motto...you don't have to be brave. You just have to show up! I am leaving the warmth of sunny Florida to head to Atlanta tomorrow to meet with one of the insurance admin people and see if we can't get something in place for me before the 16th rolls around and I'd due for another Herceptin treatment. The insurance saga continues. Anxiety level is high. I'm jealous of 7 inches of hair. I may never have that much hair again!  Actually thinking of keeping it short and pixie cut...and grey. It's easier...no muss, no fuss. But I do look much older. Maybe it's about time. I am probably the senior member of this group anyway. So I may as well look the part of dowager Queen. Maybe someday I'll get brave and post a new picture. Hugs to all. Stay warm and toasty and don't go out in that snow unless it's an emergency. You deserve a break...we all do!  XXOO",

You, my friend, have been through so much, and yet your spirit is so strong and positive. You are an inspiration. I think we all need a good laugh every day so here's my contribution to the preservation of your funny bone...I found this video of my patron saint, Rosanne Rosanndanna, the Weekend Update Medical Correspondent, talking about smoking. The guy who complains in his letter about his ill health after giving up smoking sounds like us here on this board!  Hope it gives you at least one good belly laugh...that helps your breathing, gets oxygen into your blood and promotes better overall health.  Laughter just makes me feel better!

Last year wasn't our year...or maybe it was. We each learned a lot about ourselves over the course of the treatments and we've come out the other side...different, to be sure. But better in many ways. I will never again take good health or good fortune for granted or think of it as an entitlement. I feel blessed to still be here, little bit of grey fuzz and all, and to have met each of you along this bumpy path. Chey,you are the poster child for \"I think I can, I think I can, I know I can!\" I know that everyone here is just thrilled that you were able to make the speech and stand proud as having survived the ordeal. How great. I will also pray that your newest lump is nothing to worry about. It's just much scarier now every time you find a lump or bump anywhere. I know it's not the same, but remember back in October when I got stung by the wasp on my arm on my cancer side? Well that sucker of a lump is smaller but it won't go away. What in heck is that about? Will I never heal normally again? Tina...I don't know if one is supposed to say congratulations on your cancerversary but I happy that's behind you. You have been through so much and you have such a wonderful and gentle attitude.   And thanks, Jackie, for the info on the ooph. I really need to have that done but still have no satisfactory answer regarding my insurance so things keep getting pushed back farther and farther. And gals, please do not settle for just mammograms and don't let anyone you know settle for mammograms if they have cystic or dense breasts. Since so many cancers don't show on mammos, we need to demand ultrasounds and even MRI's if there is a question on the ultrasound. My vulnerability is showing...walking through this dx part with my friend who is supposed to have surgery in the next week has given me even more reason to be concerned about the accuracy of mammos. She is faced with a double mastectomy when the mammogram still doesn't show anything is wrong. And finally, a bit of fluff...you know that last week I went to Atlanta to meet with insurance people and have a bit of R&R. The security check and travel stuff wasn't bad but the weather there was just awful...high winds and biting rain in 27 degrees. Anyway, on Saturday going to the airport for me to head back to Florida we got passed on I-75 by the Oscar Meyer Weiner Mobile. It's a hoot to have a hot dog in a bun pass you at 65 MPH. And then while waiting for my flight, I saw Elvis in Concourse C. And I was able to snap a photo of him with the Traveling Gnome. Something lighthearted for a change of pace. Wishing you all sunshine and good days ahead.  XXOO Bon",

I once was pretty down and someone on one of the boards responded in such as way that I took offense. She didn't mean what I read into what she wrote...sometimes writing doesn't bring out the inflection and tone of the author, so misunderstandings occur.  We are all on edge and trying to encourage is just as difficult as asking for encouragement. Vicky, I hope you don't give up on these incredibly supportive and courageous \"veterans\" on this board. We are all fearful of chemo and cancer. We've all had our trials and tribulations. We've had different SEs while on the same tx. We have different ways of coping and different support systems in place. But we've learned more from each other right here than from anywhere else. No one here dismisses anyones complaints or problems, nor their triumphs. This is where we come to talk, cry, scream and celebrate. It is a sisterhood of 'survivors', originally bound by circumstance, and now bound by respect and affection. You are always welcome here. But if you do not choose to post again, we wish you all the best with your tx and for your future. ",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2011 10:44AM - edited Feb 11, 2011 11:24AM by PearlGirl Hey all....Sherry,so happy that you got that dang port removed and can cross that off the list.  Those things are great when they work and a total nightmare when they don't. I will keep all fingers and toes crossed that you never again in your life need another port. The word 'port' should now only mean left in nautical terms, a lovely destination in cruise terms, and a strong sweet wine off the spirits menu. Ginny...glad your doc caught the rising vitamin D level and cut you back. If you remember I told everyone about when I had vit D toxicity from getting too much from all the pills and supplements my former doc was giving me. And I had to dx myself before she  finally did the test and believed me. Chey, We will all be praying that the lump is absolutely nothing to worry about. But you might have something there. Maybe we could start a new thread here called 1-800 diagnose me...we would have one pat answer....we'd tell everyone to go get as many tests as they can afford to assure themselves that it is or is not something to worry about. And to advocate for MRI's and ultrasounds vs just mammograms.  Chey...you stick on them like white on rice until they give you an appointment. Toni,I applaud you for working with the Breast cancer Coalition in Pennsylvania (spelled it out to keep my memory sells functioning). I know a few people still in that state and will mention the organization to them. One is an old friend who is a nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood so she must have availability to their contact info. Liz,I used the pure Aloe and that messy Aquaphor during and after rads for another month. Now I have a vit E gel from Walgreen's. don't know if it does much for my scars or not. Right after surgery I got pure Vit E oil in Walgreen's, too. I just don't like the oils because they just get all over everything, Your oncologist sounds like a jewel. From what I hear, you should stay in AZ as long as possible and avoid the cold. Mimi...MRIs are supposed to be great for detection but a properly performed ultrasound can do wonders at detecting suspicious areas and cancers, too. They are far cheaper than MRIs and I think most everyone is safer with a mammo and ultrasound than with a straight mammo.  And for hair...well mine is about an inch long and it's coming in curly in the back, Straight as a pin everywhere else. And white with a tinge of black. If I put on some make-up and jewelry, it looks stylish. Can't decide if I'll keep it this way or not. Of course, I guess I really have to wait for 6 months to see what it will finally develop into. Latte...YIPPEEE...can you hear the cheers all the way in Israel? I'm so happy you've finished with radiation but sorry you are in pain from burns. Wish I knew of a magic bullet for you to get over the rads SEs fast.  Glad you have the ooph scheduled and can move on with things. Getting all this stuff behind us and only looking forward will be nice, right? Joan, You just want to go to Thailand to escape the snow!  How are you holding up these days? Jackie,your whole post was one \"oh, my gosh\"...from the RA to tissue expander horror show to the doc who didn't know your mx status and wanted to send you for an mammogram...all I can say is YIKES. Praying for you that the RA dx doesn't stick.  DMom Karin...well, you are the best cheerleader on this board. Bless you for being there for everyone. How are things going for you? Tina...so glad your insurance issue was resolved in your favor. Mine is still up in the air. Insurance is still a big problem for me. I did just get notified yesterday of coverage retro to Feb.1. But that doesn't address my January out of pocket nor other issues that have arisen. Golly, I just hate to wish my life away, but I can hardly wiat the few more years until I hit 65 and can get covered by Medicare. And sadly, I got a phone call about an hour ago from a high school friend who was dx with bc last Monday. She sees the surgeon and oncologist next Thursday. And yesterday I went with my coworker for her visit to the plastic surgeon. Her dmx is scheduled for March 2.  I feel like screaming (got that soundproof room ready for me DMom?) because bc is all around me these days. Oh one big positive is that for both of my friends who are newly dx with bc, I have been able to truthfully tell them that this website was a life saver for me. One of them has already been on the site looking at the medical questions and answers and the other is probably on it right now, looking for information. I can't thank the people at Breastcancer.org enough for building and maintaining this site or you all for the support you've offered so generously over this last year. Hugs all around.  Bon  (PS/ if I ever figure out how to insert a photo into these message I'll add Elvis and the Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile. Both are good for a few laughs).",

I do not mean to monopolize this board with my personal issues but am so distressed over my Mom's condition that I am a mess this morning. She is starting to verbalize that she may not make it through this. The are preparing to give her a much needed transfusion today and still fighting the Salmonella and high potassium, but without much success. At least I am consoled by the knowledge that now she is getting the attention of the very 3 docs who sat on this for weeks and didn't want to take the responsibility for admitting her before the wee hours of yesterday morning. The nurses are solicitous and my step-Dad and a friend will be with her today since I am unable to help.  My Chemo was 2 days ago and Nuelasta yesterday so am in wobbles-mode and not much good for anyone, including myself today. Have decided that cancer does not warrant a capital \"c\" in my book. It is sneaky and nasty and lowly. Have elevated Chemo to capital status since it is trying to help me eradicate the cancer and stomp it into the ground like the snake it is. Chemo reigns, SEs and all. I think cancer should have it's own even lower sub-case, almost so small as to make it disappear. I hate cancer and all that it brings. Except, perhaps, my association with all of you. This board is the best thing to come out of my cancer diagnosis so far. I'm waiting until the day I am placed in the 'NED'  (no evidence of disease) category to change your collective status to #2. If you are so inclined, please keep praying for my Mom. My prayers are with her and with all of you, too. We are fighters, warriors, and we will triumph, in body and spirit. I have to believe that.

I haven't called the doc because I just can't face anything else being an issue. The radiation oncologist was the one who told me that I needed to give myself a full 6 months after the surgery, chemo and radiation were done before I could expect to really feel more normal. I thought that was generous of him, but now I think he may be right. I finished all that in November so I am setting the end of May or June as my target to feel 'chipper'. It will be 1 year from surgery in May and I will be finishing Herceptin at the end of June.

I was out working and scratching...nice look for a professional, hey?  Tonight they are back full force. The blotches are huge and all over my extremities. I haven't started using any new drugs and am 13 days post chemo so that can't be it. Thought it might have been the mango I moved around the kitchen yesterday before it started...it's not unusual to develop an allergy to their sap, sad to say. But I made sure not to get near that thing today and it's much, much worse. I'm not freaked because I can breathe OK and going to the ER or an urgent care center doesn't make sense yet. Just took a benadryl and will try to play detective tomorrow.",

I keep thinking it can't be chemo related but if it happened to you, then maybe that's it. I've read that taxotere has a really high incidence of allergic reactions. Didn't think it would be delayed like this. I will phone onc in the AM to see if I can get any corroboration from them. I'll be really nervous to have the next tx on August 4th without having this possibility addressed. I've liberally spayed myself with anti-itch stuff and it's not working very well. Took one benadryl and that hasn't helped much either. Will probably take another in about 45 minutes. Some blotches are waning but others cropping up. Oh, Isla, if only I could be out in the lovely Florida sunshine. I so wanted to float in a pool and read a book but have put that out of my mind for now. Maybe someday next year. Besides, it's way too hot ans sticky here now for it to be enjoyable. Today it was in the mid-90's again with humidity almost as high. My cat still loves to sit on the porch but not me or the dogs. We stay in the air conditioning.",

Can you imagine if I start questioning him about fruit? He;ll have me in the funny farm pronto. I envy you who have a decent PA or ARNP to deal with. I have Brunhilda.  Actually, this specifice food info was brought to my attention by a classmate who is an anesthesiologist in WV and a former roommate who is an OB/GYN ARNP in PA. Both sent it to me indpendently. So thought it couldn't hurt to keep in mind.

Raw Eggs are also on that list of \u2018no-no's', which means say goodbye to Egg Nog during the Holiday Season.    During Chemotherapy, any uncooked, unpeeled food can pose a significant health hazard to BCW's.  Foods such as Lettuce, tomatoes, celery, apples, peaches, grapes, cherries.....in short, any raw, unpeeled, uncooked food can make a chemo patient very, VERY sick, very suddenly, and very seriously!    We know of dozens of BCW's who, within a few hours of eating a simple green salad, have found themselves suddenly and severely sick -- projectile vomiting, their fever spiking to an alarming 104+.  (More often than not, the culprit turned out to be bacteria on the lettuce).  This is nothing to fool around with.  This can be life-threatening.   While on Chemo, a body temperature in excess of 101 is reason for concern, as your Oncologist should tell you.  If, however, you suddenly find yourself being violently ill, and feverish, you should immediately (and we do me IMMEDIATELY) get to the Emergency Room.   Our advice:  while on Chemotherapy or Radiation, avoid all uncooked, unpeeled foods.  That means NO LETTUCE.  If you want to eat fresh fruit (apples, peaches, pears), make sure that you scrub them with a professional anti-bacterial food wash, AND PEEL them!  (no kidding!)  If it can't be peeled, don't eat it!  Unless you have mastered the fine art of peeling grapes, strawberries, blueberries, cherries, etc, etc, etc....forget about eating them while you're on Chemotherapy.  In fact, we recommend that you do what many BCW's have done: while on Chemo or Radiation, say goodbye to green salads, as well as all unpeeled fresh fruit or veggies and eat only cooked, or thoroughly, seriously scrubbed and then peeled foods, and if a food can't be peeled and can't be cooked, then don't eat it.   (And, if you're going to eat foods such as melons, oranges, lemons or limes, make absolutely certain that you seriously, thoroughly, severely SCRUB the exteriors of each before you cut into them, so as to get rid of any bacteria that might otherwise move from their skins or rinds, onto your knife, into the sweet, tender insides of the fruit, and from there, into the sweet, tender insides of you!)   Other edibles to be wary of while fighting Cancer include Sugar, and Acidic foods.  Extensive scientific research has proven that cancer cells thrive in high Sugar and high-Acid environments.  (To learn more about the dangers of Acid, click on the article entitled: \"The Acid Trip\".)  Better safe than seriously sick!!   You're a BC Warrior, we know you can handle it.   ",

That certainly doesn't help to keep a clear head or positive attitude, does it? Were you feeling flushed?  (Got ya...did that make you laugh or want to kill me, too? Hope it didn't offend. Just couldn't resist. Blame it on the steroids). People say stuff that comes to mind to perk you up.  They are uncomfortable with your illness, feel inadequate to deal with it, and say whatever seems 'cheerful' at the time. Or they say things like \"oh, my friend had that a three years ago and she's fine. You will be, too.\"  It's well meaning but not deeply personal or moving...which is where they want to stay...at that safe distance, not knowing what really happens to you day to day. I think that's why I write a journal update to about 80 people now about once every 3 weeks, sort of on chemo treatment schedule. I let them know my challenges, my physical condition and emotions-good and bad.  Not only does it help me to 'get it all out' but it gets them 'up close and personal' with cancer and the rollercoaster ride I'm on. I don't hold back. I do include snippets of humor...after all, when look like Uncle Fester, I may as well acknowledge it. My hope in the end is that I and they will be far more sensitive to, and in tune with, anyone else we encounter going through a live changing experience like this. I swear, at least 3/4 of them have never dealt with cancer this closely, nor had the realities of our daily changes explained or articulated. So we are all learning together, except from my end, it's a bit more traumatic and dramatic. What gets me is when someone says how much they like my wig and maybe I should keep this style when my hair grows in. The wig is shades darker than my natural color with darker roots that do make it look real for some, but it's not ME.  I know it looks fine but it's not ME. They see me with a different hairdo. I see me with a ratty wig...well, it's not ratty and I wear it with a headband so it looks more like a real head of hair. But you know what I mean. It's OK but it's just not MY hair. That's in a plastic bag in on the closet shelf. Lord knows what I'll do with it but for now, there it sits. Now, as for your MIL...well, do you have a stash of brandy...for you or for her. Slip some in her tea and see if she mellows out. No, I know that won't do. But poison is illegal and jail on top of chemo and cancer doesn't sound very attractive, does it?  I really don't know what you do about her and your trip except to pray for strength (I scream \"GIVE ME STRENGTH\" a couple times a day, usually when trying to deal with clients who are driving me right round the bend).  Those old fashioned and short sighted 'mind over matter' types are such a chore to be around in good times, and now it's a thousand times more aggravating.  Plus you're in winter now, right?  A good dose of warm weather and a short stroll outdoors might take the edge off. So sorry that it's not the right season for that. I hope that at least some of this has cheered you and that you know we all understand how you feel. Some days we all have our heads in the porcelain...figuratively, if not literally.  This is a very bumpy ride. Hold on tight.   Bon",

Add that to my professional repertoire!  I don't have a gall bladder anymore so that's not the culprit. I had a bit of this after round 1 of the chemo. Not so bad post round 2. This time it's a winner....\"And the award for the most bothersome SE of round 3 goes to ...Acid Reflux!\"   Sorry to whine about something like this when others are facing bigger challenges. I worry about everyone...Chey, please see if  there is a professional counselor who specializes in working with people confronted by illness. He or she (hopefully it would be a she in this case) might have a fresh approach and and get you to a more peaceful mind space. I Googled your area and found at least one psychologist who mentions that she deals with chronic health issues. (Her name is Anita Kemp, can't remember any the rest of her other info. Don't know if she's good or not). You can't make good choices when you're depressed. And it's hard not to be depressed when you're faced with all this chemo and cancer stuff.  I worry that your depression will paralyze you or keep you from making the best decisions for your future. We are always here for you but perhaps you will benefit even more from seeing a qualified professional. Going back to my hole for the rest of the day. Be well everyone.",

I don't know of anyone taking advil or motrin but if you take that I wouldn't think you'd be taking tylenol, too. Med combos are notorious for making people vomit.  I also got to the point that water made me vomit.I had to switch to flat ginger ale and very dilute juice or decaffeinated iced tea. If I went back to water I'd vomit.Try the ginger ale...I did the diet type so as not to add too all that sugar. Vicky, Don't cancel, that last appointment. It will get better and you've come so far. Honestly, you can do this. Only 1 more to go to get the full effect of the chemo and fight that cancer devil. ",

It has kept me afloat and although it has some SEs, none are as bad as the chemo, in my opinion. My MO warned that it could cause flu-like symptoms. I got mostly aches and pains, both bone and muscle. Didn't really know what  was from chemo and what was from Neulasta. When he saw how low my WBC was 8 days post the first tx he immediately gave me Nuelasta and then gave it to me 24 hrs after tx for rounds 2, 3 and 4. Had CBC run 8 days post each tx and after 2, 3 and 4  the WBC's were up and fighting infection!  Don't know what would have happened to me without it.

Stress makes you hold your body differently, even in the mold.  I know you're going to be on your stomach vs. the back position that I am in, but it still makes sense that you need to be relaxed and calm, since just knowing you need to have rads is stress unto itself and plenty to deal with.

Sending good vibes your way for a peaceful evening and tx. Hope you get home before midnight! Had my remarking and measuring for my boosts today. They think the lead shield should be ready by tomorrow and they'll check for fit. Thinking about lead shields makes me feel vulnerable. Sort of Superman and kryptonite. I know rads is supposed to be hi-tech. To me it's sci-fi. RO says my congestion/cough could be rads related swelling. He told me to drink lots (where have I head that before?). I am now wheezing but taking all the drugs prescribed by the ARNP. Today I can actually breathe a bit better and am coughing less but still it's pretty nasty. Having trouble typing this in between hacking coughs. Time for more inhalers. Latte...yep, cranberry juice is supposed to be the trick for UTI's. I drink it mixed with diet gingerale or vodka and a bit of Rose's lime juice (something we call a Bontini) and haven't had a UTI in ages! However you drink it, maybe it will help. Hope you're better soon.   Good night, my dear friends.  I'm off to try to take all my meds and get some sleep between coughing fits.

My BS told me that this was an extremely aggressive form or cancer that might more readily reappear elsewhere, so they recommend removing my ovaries. That's because they are easily removable as compared to my brain, bones and liver!  My RO told me that Herceptin was my best chance. My MO says this cancer should be past me when I finsh up in June.  But he doesn't rule out others in the future. I guess that this is all part of learning to live with a cancer dx and trying to climb though and get past the fear of it all. And as the end of tx approaches, it feels odd. So happy to be done with the tortures of chemo and rads, but frightened to not have something tangible going on every day to combat the cancer.  We've been at war and now we are supposed to put down our weapons.  It's truly like post traumatic stress. Learning to not be afraid and to move on with a zest for life will take time for me. Maybe for some of you, too.

I so wish I lived close by so that we could sit, talk and share the moments in a more personal manner than through this blog. But we have overcome distance for months now, all of us developing friendships that I honestly think will last in our hearts forever. This cancer journey is so unpredictable and such a lonesome, rocky road. Just know that we are here with you, not able to take the pain or fear away, but to share the fight with you, whatever the outcome. I posted on another thread some weeks ago how a friend described to me the 'Slinky' theory of life, comparing life's journey too the actions of the toy coil that was so popular years ago. You move along with the daily ups and downs...like a Slinky bouncing gently back and forth.  When a crisis arises, you put your head down and march forward,  pulling with all your might, to get over the hurdle.  And when that immediate crisis has passed, and you can stop to take a breather, the Slinky bounces back and hits you in the butt!  I think that with this news your slinky tumbled down a long flight of stairs, too. bc itself (remember, I won't give it a capital status in my life) has already changed everything. No matter what happens now none of us will ever be the same. The slinky got one or two coils stretched out during the crisis mode and it will always be different. I am here for you day or night. You can contact me with a personal message and I'll give you my cell phone number if you need to talk, not type. I will always try to help you stay positive, even when things might seem overwhelmingly dark.  Attitude can't cure everything, but it can help you breathe easier and stay in a hopeful and helpful mind space. You'll need positive energy to keep moving forward. I'm sure your doctor can get the biopsy done in the next week and at least the payment won't be an issue. It seems criminal that we have to worry about the cost and means of payment for these tests and services when faced with a cancer diagnosis. It's not like we want to spend money on scans and biopsies and lab tests and drugs. Sherry, I send you huge hugs and much love. You will be prominent in my prayers tonight and I will ask my friends who have prayer groups and chains to do the same. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you. And please remember that the doctor isn't certain what he sees and it may still be just residual damage from your auto accident. Fingers crossed. Keep pulling that slinky.   Bon",

Wondering if it's time for us to create out own private chat site somewhere so that we can trade thoughts without being 'stalked'?  The best part about being here is that we are used to it and this site sends us messages whenever someone posts on this thread. I get the alerts on my phone so can read them and follow along fairly quickly. Don't know of any private chat sites that would do that for us, too. Maybe we need to send multiple private messages to trade email addresses and start emailing our 'posts' directly to our 'group'. But, for better or for worse, I really owe breastcancer.org a huge debt of gratitude for allowing me to feel like I am going to be whole again because of my new-found best friends...YOU!  Save your pennies...champagne and eclairs on the menu, WD40 for what ails us, and pearls to adorn us.  Can't wait.

And Joan, your hair looks great. Isn't it nice to feel free and go out without a head cover?

And I think it's grand that you're wearing pearls to your son's wedding. I just love them because they are classically beautiful anytime, anyplace, in any form,  Just like us!    Pearl gemstone meaning:The pearl is the oldest known gem, and for many centuries it was considered the most valuable. Unlike all gems, the pearl is organic matter derived from a living creature. There is much folklore and tradition about the pearl. In fact so much history accompanies this stone that five months claim it as a birthstone - February, April, June (traditional), July and November. The pearl is an astral stone for the signs Gemini and Cancer, and astrologers link it to the moon. It was said in some early cultures that the pearl was born when a single drop of rain fell from the heavens and became the heart of the oyster. Pearls have been called the 'teardrops of the moon'. Some believe that pearls were formed by the passage of angels through the clouds of heaven.Over time, the pearl has become the symbol of purity and innocence. What do you think of the new Avatar? I won't leave it up long but wonder if you think it's good enough to replace my old working photo that was on here for months. This one is the current me, grey hair and all. Hard to believe I had long blond hair a year ago. Just glad to have hair, period! Anyway, if you think this is pretty OK, I might just make just order new business cards and be done with it. Now when I pass out the old cards with that blonde woman's pix, people fee sorry for me. I don't need pity...just sales! (Please look carefully at this new photo...you may be able to see the long strand of pearls). Love and hugs...Bon PS/ I think the Pearl is also a symbol of patience, persistence and tenderness.  That little grain of sand stews and brews inside the mollusk shell to become a beautiful treasured gem.  We've been through a lot and are all gems, too! ",

For however long we need...for however long we can...we forge ahead, knowing that there's a big world out there for us to take part in and we struggle to rejoin those who are 'truly' living. Honestly, I don't know if I will ever feel totally 'secure' again, but I am certainly more accepting of the knowledge that I'm not fully in charge. My type-A personality is now a Type-Ac. That's for After cancer. Anything can happen at any time...good and bad.   Everyone on this planet has an uncertain future. But we have one...we have a FUTURE!!!  A year ago none of us was so sure of that. Now we are more mindful to savor great pleasures and cherish small treasures. After having cancer be the first thing I think of upon waking every morning for over a year now, I wonder if a time will come when it isn't in the forefront of my thoughts. I surely don't want to dwell on it forever and long for it to become a distant memory, fogged by time. The things I want to take away from this dreadful experience are a stronger sense of compassion and my connection to all of you. We've traveled this rough journey together and shared very personal, often agonizing details, as well as some great laughs along the way. We're here to champion the one needing a boost, and to high-five the one in celebration. We are a team. Frazzled and once fractured, now healing. Trying to make the best of what we have to work with, together. (In our pearls, of course). For me, that is really security. Knowing that you are all here and that you do understand. I can face the rest of what comes, and go about the business of life, knowing that I have you all in my corner, if and when I need a hug, a bit of encouragement, or a pat on the back.  Peace, ladies. Let us all have peace.",

She did great with the exchange surgery...was driving herself within 10 days...maybe even sooner. Not suggesting that you do that, but just letting you know that it was an easy surgery compared to the mx. All she has left to do it the tattoo and that won't be for another couple of months. Maybe when she get's here new nipple I'll join her and get some eyebrows! They haven't grown back. As for the port...well, I guess that after yesterday I'll be getting it pulled out sooner rather than later. After all this time, the port failed to give blood yesterday.  They did infuse through it and didn't make me go for a port scan or adjustment at the hospital across the street because it was the last infusion. The oncologist says to have it taken out now but he knows the BS favors leaving it in for awhile. Hope I can convince him to take it in July so I can get on with things, It's never been comfortable, never. In fact, it's been painful and annoying since day one. Actually, I'll be thrilled when it's gone. I think that having a port sort of signifies you're sick...a thick medical chart and a port aren't the hallmark of a healthy person. Can't do much about the thickness of the chart, but I can say bye-bye to the port! The hysterectomy was suggested early on due to the ER,PR negative status of my tumor. I will make an appointment with a GYN next week to see if that's still in the cards.  I would hate to end up with cancer of the ovaries or uterus when they aren't necessary to my existence at this stage of my life. Will keep you posted on that. Ok, Lizzyanne, we have to countdown another 3 Herceptins and that exchange surgery before we do the big victory dance for you.  I'll be waiting for news. Hugs.  Bon",

He listened carefully to my description of the aching under my arm and the shooting pains in the lower part of my breast. After lots of poking and prodding, some of which was a bit uncomfortable, he said that it is related to the rads tx, not anything that could mean a recurrence of bc. He said it's early inflammation of the breast tissue and chest wall and suggests that I treat it with massage, no lifting or excess stretching with that arm (the right) and to take an OTC anti-inflammatory, and to wear only a sports bra. So there you go...even after only 4 tx the rads I have SEs. 28 to go. Hope it's all worth it. Although I like this RO a great deal and know this has been recommended by both my BS and MO, I'm having a more difficult time accepting rads tx as something I want or need. Anyone feel the same way?",

They provide free hat wraps for any cancer patient, knowing that hair loss is a traumatic part of the diagnosis and treatment process, and that a lush and lovely head wrap is a most welcome gift. Gail Arch (aka GailA) left work in 2009 to fight the fight with metastatic cancer. She wanted something to do, as if fighting cancer isn't already a full time job. She decided to sew a few hats from materials she collected in her world travels, and to give them away to women also fighting the same battle.  Three of her friends (Sarah Adams, Paige Yates and Debby Belichick) merged thier talents, expanded on the idea and forged ahead to form this public charity that helps women living with cancer. Go to http://www.gailafund.org/ and looks them over. Then click on the form and sign up to receive one FREE. They even let you put down three of your favorites and they really do try to send one of those almost immediately upon receipt of your registration. They have a huge selection of colors and fabrics...even silks and soft linens. And yes, the would love donations and they do sell these wraps so if you'd like more than one you can purchase at any time. Or if a friend offers to get you a gift, maybe another Gaila headwrap would be nice. Really, do give this a try. It's a very lovely gesture. They can't take the cancer away but they can gift you a beautiful headpiece to wear with pride",

So July 2011 can't come fast enough for me. Tamoxifen isn't prescribed for ER,PR negative tumors like mine, but I read somewhere on this website about a new lab study in mice that showed how ER,PR negative cells when treated with Herceptin changed to + status. So that can mean all sorts of things. Maybe HER2 negative tumors would respond to Herceptin,too, or maybe after Herceptin, those who had ER,PR negative tumors might benefit from Tamoxifen. It's new research and still just done in the lab, but exciting to think about. The search for a cure or at least a great treatment that will stop the cancer in it's tracks does continue.

Tomorrow morning is my drive to and from rads tx and then clients from noon to 5. I'll work with them again on Tuesday from 9-12 and then hightail it to rads center for an afternoon session when they plan to do some measurements or something to get ready for my boosts.

But has anyone else noticed diminished strength. Perhaps it's from lack of activity, but honestly, I can barely open a jar or bottle or can or do anything requiring exertion with my hands.  My hands have no strength at all.

Then the stuffiness started and I ended up hacking and spitting  (nice visual, hey?) many times each day. I saw the BS, MO and RO last week and none of them wanted to think it was tx related. So yesterday, in desperation, I went to see my primary ARNP. She was a bit miffed that they threw me back to her because she thinks it could be rads tx related...but she is taking on the job of dealing with it. I ended up with 4 rx and feel better already this morning. She has me using an Albuteral inhaler, plus Flovent (a mild steroid inhaler), some cough 'beads' called Benzonatate, and a z-pak of antibiotics just in case I was getting infected. She threw everything she can think of at this thing and we are praying that one of these does the trick. I'm not saying that your situation is at all the same, mostly because you describe just throat stuff and mine went from throat only to throat, sinus and chest. But maybe a trip to your PCP would help. It certainly did for me. I just have to keep remembering that these docs treating my bc don't want to treat all of me. Today I go for rads tx 21 and remarking in preparation of the boosts. Only 2 and /12 weeks to go. Skin on my chest is showing pink and finally breaking down. Had to put cortisone cream on an eruption last night. Seems to have done miracles by this morning. Have only been using aloe so far. Keeping my fingers crossed that the rest of these tx's go smoothly. I just cannot emotionally or physically deal with anything else right now. To all who have finished rads..HOORAY FOR YOU!!! Can't wait for the rest of us here to be there, too. The end is insight, Ladies.  \"I think I can, I think I can, I KNOW I can!\" Have a great day everyone. ",

It feels so great not to have that daily appointment, doesn't it?  At least it did for me. Today was the fist day in 6 and 1/2 weeks that I didn't have to be there at 10:15. I felt liberated! Soon Dawn46 and gin2ca and SharonNM and AlCa will be joining us! Congrats in advance! ",
