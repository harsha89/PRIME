Millissa was diagnosed at 32 er/pr+ with 18 malignant nodes. She went through chemo TAC, lumpectomy and radiation. Fours years later (approx 1 year ago) the cancer came back in her leg. She went through 6 months of chemo and radiation. Her hair is finally growing back and today she learned that her tumor markers are elevated to 70 something she has pain in her tail bone and the doctor ordered a pet scan. Millissa is scared and she asked the doctor if she is going to die and he said he didn't know. BTW I met Millissa when I was going through chemo. Can anyone share stories of women that are surviving and living many years with stage IV breast cancer. I need to find ways to help bring her spirit back and give her hope, she's only 37. Hugs!
