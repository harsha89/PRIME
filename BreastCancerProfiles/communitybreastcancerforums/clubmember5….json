I was lucky and had very little side effects during treatments.  I have however had joint, bone, and muscle pain since.  Nothing I can't live with, just annoying.  My white blood count hasn't come back up like I would have hoped to, but Dr. doesn't seem concerned at this point.  I finished chemo in March 07.  Good luck and stay well. clubmember 5",

And lots of frest fruits and vegetables help keep it away.  I say let's try it!!  LET'S ALL SAY WE ARE GOING TO LOOK IT IN THE EYE AND SAY  Go AWAY AND STAY GONE  I have several friends who have been where we are and they tell me when I have a scary moment \"You're going to be fine\".  I think if we say that over and over we will be. We will support each other. My surgeon says I'll be fine and so does my onc. I had a bilateral mastectomy and did well, 4 rounds of taxotere and cytoxin with no problems.  I hope this was a good sign that all will be ok! Take care, Mary Jane clubmember5",
