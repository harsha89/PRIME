I\u2019m expecting to get stage iv diagnosis this week after my lung biopsy.  I\u2019ve been on chemo a lot this year. I\u2019ve got 3 taxotere, 1 CEF and 12 taxol. Pathology indicated my cancer is not responsive to chemo yet they give it to me along with herceptin and perjeta. I\u2019ve had a recurrence at the start of the year when they stopped herceptin to give me CEF. Again I\u2019m having a recurrence after they\u2019ve stopped herceptin.  Are there stage iv ladies running exclusively off targeted therapies? I don\u2019t think I can do chemo right away again... I need some time",
