I also found the setting up part of treatment a little emotional so I had really upbeat can't help but tap your toes music on my IPOD. I would crank the tunes and tell them to tap me on the shoulder once my IV was all set up. I am scheduled to start another bout of experimental chemo next month. Oh Goody!!  The tradition in  our house is that my kids get to have fun shaving my head when my hair starts to fall out. We get a big chocolate cake and have a \"It's Just Hair\" Party.  Made the first time a little less scary for my kids... and me.  Wish me luck!!",
