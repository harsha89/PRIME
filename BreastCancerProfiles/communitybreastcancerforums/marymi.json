      "Content": "marymi wrote: I had it a month ago and thought I was all clear after a course of clindamycin, but I week ago Wednesday my fever shot up past 103 and my le arm broke out with red welts everywhere and swelled way up. My PCP took one look and called had me admitted for IV antibiotics. I got to stay for a week. I guess it is time to come out of denial and take this condition seriously. I have found a new LE therapist closer to me and hopefully can see her next week. I have time because my PCP has not cleared me to return to work and am on short term disability. I know I am rambling, but who knew this would be so hard? My arn looks huge and the healing areas make it look like leprosy. I don't know how I am going to keep from getting infected over and over because I have psoriasis on my finger tips and the skin breaks at least one spot a day. My dermatologist does not seem to take LE seriously, so I guess I need a new one. Time to stop whining I guess. Thanks for listening. Log in to post a reply",
