    "Content": "WisconsinMom88 wrote: I had found a lump on my left breast about two months ago I finally when to my Dr. they confirmed an unknown mass, I had a mammogram which showed nothing due to my dense breast tissue, the ultrasound detected an unknown mass about the size of a quarter. I then had a vaccum biopsy which tested as a hard skin cyst. My general surgeon wants to keep a close eye on it because there could be cancer cells since only a small portion of the mass was tested. Now after two weeks there is a dimple is my right breast, my Dr. confirmed it was a dimple but couldn't tell if there was a lump because of my dense breast tissue. My sister had breast cancer at 27, I am 27 now....I'm just a little overwhelmed. Log in to post a reply",
