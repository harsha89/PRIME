I also was not expecting the rec for chemo but I checked out the MD Anderson web site and looked at their protocol. Friday I finished 4 rounds of cytoxan/epirubicin. We did dose dense (every 2 weeks) b/c I could shave a month off my treatment. I'm glad it's over. I did pretty good, continued to work, was very tired, took good drugs for nausea and diarrhea. Get that oncotype dx done and get another oncologist. and check out MD Anderson's website and see where you fit in their treatment protocol. best of luck to you, be strong, Lexapro is a great antidepressant and you might ask about it.",
