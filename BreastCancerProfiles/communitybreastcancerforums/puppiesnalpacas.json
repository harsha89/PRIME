No family history, young, figured it's probably a cyst or fibroadenoma, saw my PCP who felt it and said \"oh, it's too big to be anything bad.\" Scheduled me for an ultrasound just in case. Was so sure it was going to be simple, painless, in and out, no big deal. Just had my ultrasound yesterday. Not a cyst. Looked solid, but weird... they couldn't say it it was a fibroadenoma. Said I probably need a mammo and biopsy. Got the mammo done on the spot. I don't know what the actual report would have said, but the radiologist briefly showed me the pictures and said there were calcifications throughout the lump. (I just see a ton of white dots.) And here I am trying to interpret words from both the radiologist and the tech... \"whatever it is, at least we caught it early\" and \"in case you need surgery, whatever it is, some things need to be removed.\" and when they were talking about what kind of biopsy I should get \"oh yeah, we should definitely take a sample of those calcifications.\" I have my biopsy scheduled for a week later (10/6). I was a mess yesterday. Woke up today feeling okay, had a fun day out, but got increasingly anxious in the evening. Don't know what to think. Don't know what to do. And here's the irony - despite being a physician (and having warned my own patients to be wary of googling), I suddenly find myself reading and googling as well. Just trying to figure out how to get through the next couple weeks.
