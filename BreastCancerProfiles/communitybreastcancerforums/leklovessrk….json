So glad to have found this group to talk to.  I have pretty much kept this whole cancer thing a secret from most everyone except a couple of close friends and family.  I haven't even told my children.  They knew I had surgery but I told them it was for a cyst in my breast.  I just couldn't do it to them.  I hope I did the right thing.  I have always been a very private person. Best of Luck to everyone today!",
