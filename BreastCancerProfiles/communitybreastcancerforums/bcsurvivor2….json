      "Content": "Feb 10, 2009 12:15PM - edited Mar 4, 2009 04:48PM by bcsurvivor2b Hi, I'm a new nurse (1 yr) Dec 2008.  I graduated with a ADN in NY and moved to AZ in Aug 07 with my husband, two boys (12,10) and a dog. Did I mention of becoming a RN at 47? Talk about a challenge!  (oh, and I'm moderately-severly hearing impaired, since birth). Of all the groups to join, this isn't one that I had on my list, but nonetheless, here I am.  It's comforting to know there are others who have been there and can feel the pain, apprehension, fear, numbness I feel.  I had a single mastectomy with 2 sentinel nodes (-) removed.  My ER/PR prior to surgery were  ER 0% /PR 20%.  After surgery my ER 10%/PR 60%.  My tumor was 1.8cm, margins clear.  Oncotype result (8).  No chemo needed.  Will be taking Tamoxifen for 4 years.  Keeping positive goes a long way!!! ",

I've had terrible joint and muscle pains that have gotten progressively worse since finishing. My last appointment with the oncologist I complained about always being either in pain or at minimum, uncomfortable. He did an ANA test which came back positive. He's directed me to go to a rheumatologist. I had the same chemo cocktail (Carboplatin and Taxotere with Herceptin).",

It feels like a small balloon filled with water... It certainly feels like it could be popped if poked...  Thanks for a great diagnosis Kateful.      I googled it and found this website: Most seromas will reabsorb themselves over a number of weeks or months. http://www.twinkletwinkles.com/2006/05/seroma-after-mastectomy-what-is-seroma.html also right here on breastcancer.org: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/side_effects/seroma.jsp I don't want to risk having an infection from poking around which could delay my chemo treatments..... I love this site!!!  Thanks:)",

What's TE and PS...??. .from what I could understand..I think you were asking about the swelling....  I have an appt next week with my surgeon so I'll address it then... I've had other surgeries and it's not the same kind of swelling you get after a surgery incision.  It's more like extra fluid just hanging around..  thanks :) I hope this explained it better..... ",
