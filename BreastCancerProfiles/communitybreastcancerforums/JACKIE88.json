It has been here for about 18 months. At first it was a small bruise, about the size of a postage stamp, then it became larger, then became hard and red with black blood blister looking areas.  Shame on me for not following up sooner, but I was really in denial.  One day I was on the internet and saw a picture on the right side that identified a blood blister as cancer.  So, soon after that I did get it checked out.  I think I'm pretty lucky it hasn't spread. Maybe I have the nice kind. I would love to PM, but I don't know how. If that's a setting, I'll go and set that up. If not, let me know what to do to get it going.",
