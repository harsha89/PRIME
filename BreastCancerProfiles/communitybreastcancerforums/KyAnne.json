My doctor felt it right away and I am scheduled for an ultrasound and mammogram tomorrow morning. I know that being 20 years old the chances of it being breast cancer is really, really slim (my doctor told me like 90% positive it's most likely not). I just can't help but jump to the worst conclusions about things like this though. I was told if the lump looks to be solid I will be sent to have a biposy done...can you tell right away from a biospy or does that take time to get the results back? Thank you so much!  Log in to post a reply",
