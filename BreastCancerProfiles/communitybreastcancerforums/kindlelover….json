My mom died of BC 6 mo after diagnosis at age 53 so I wasn't totally surprised when the biopsy came back positive.   BRCA negative (woo hoo for my daughters and granddaughters!!) but the MRI came back showing another tumor in the same breast which the PET scan confirmed.  It will be biopsied after surgery but because of the location, it's being called a 2nd occurrence and not a spread of the original lesion.  The oncologist says this almost guarantees chemo.  Has anyone been denied a prophylactic mastectomy on the 2nd breast?  Any tips on preventing lymphodema?  With the little that I know, I know I want to prevent that. :)  I'm so grateful I found this site and for the information I've already found today.  Happy healing to those who are healing and best wishes to those of us still yet to have surgery.  Go April!  ;)",

I was wondering if anyone was told yay or nay to deoderant?  I haven't been using it because it seemed like I probably shouldn't, but I'm tried of not smelling so fresh by noon.  :)  What do you think?",

I've been driving for a little over a week.  I've been told to keep wearing a compression bra - at least for three more weeks when I go back in for another check.  I tried to find a sports bra last week but it is almost more uncomfortable than the surgery bra.  Maybe I'll head to Dillards and see if I can find a Lunaire there.  Thanks for the suggestion, Beaglesgirl. I start chemo a week from today - T/C - only four treatments.  I'm debating whether to get my hair cut short before I lose it - it's fairly long now.  I think it might not be so sad to lose it if it starts out shorter.  What do you all think? Hang in there, everyone!  I'm amazed at how quickly many of you are recovering.  You are all strong, amazing people! ",
