I am waiting now for my Doctor to call me with the name of a surgeon.I am leaning towards just having it removed for peace of mind.My father and his mother died of cancer. funny thing is that I have been considering having a breasy lift and augmentation for some time now and then this came up. I've been reading several comments from this site and sounds like many are in the same boat as far as not understanding the risk of a radial scar and the need for surgery. It's a lot to think about but as a mom and grandma I want to be around for awhile.I am 52.",
