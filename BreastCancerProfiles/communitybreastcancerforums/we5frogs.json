      "Content": "we5frogs wrote: My sister was diagnosed with dermatomyositis about 2 1/2 years ago, and now the doctor found a lump on her mammogram. She was told that radiation is not a viable option for her because it would worsen the dermatomyositis (which the cancer has already done), and she is not interested in having chemo as she feels the effects outweigh the benefits, especially given the inter-ralationship between the cancer and the dermatomyositis, with each having an adverse effect on the other. She had a mastectomy, and we are now waiting for the pathology results.  Has anyone here had these two diagnoses concurrently? I would love to be able to give her some solid hope based on life experiences of others who know first hand what she is facing.  thanks so much - Charle Log in to post a reply",
