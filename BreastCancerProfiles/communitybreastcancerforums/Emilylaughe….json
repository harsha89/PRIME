She started getting small red bumps that were finally biopsied, resulting in a positive screen for cancer. Her disease is slow and degenerative, but at the moment it is feeling fast. She has swelling all through her body\u2014her trunk, around her organs and lungs, and it started today in one of her legs. (The leg isn't too bad yet.) I'm sitting beside her as she finally sleeps, listening to her breathe and wheeze and wishing that things were somehow different than they are. At least we have our answer as to why the swelling wouldn't go down; it turns out it was cancer and not just lymph fluid that keep multiplying. I thought that cancer tended to make people thinner, but with my mom it is plumping her back up. All of the swelling is causing stress on her organs, and it's all gotten very, very complicated. She's working on being enrolled in a clinical trial for an oral chemo and new hormone that should work together to give her some more time. Beyond that, we might try a few rounds of taxol (she was on taxotere already, so that might not work as effectively as they would like). The doctors insist that she still has life left in her. But not knowing what to do to make her more comfortable or to make this easier or to fix her is infuriating and heartbreaking. Anyhow. Just logging in to update with sad news. Thank you all for your continued support. I'm going to allow her to sleep, but continue pondering if I should wake her to get her to a hospital. I just can't stand considering waking her when she's finally sleeping after an uncomfortable few days of her not sleeping.",

I've been reading a lot about water therapy and it is good to hear that it has worked for you. We were on our way toward controlling it and it is just so frustrating to figure out how to get this right. I am hoping that once she starts doing the extra PT we may actually be on our way again. I just feel so bad for her! She is on oral chemo right now (nothing detectable, but after a recurrence to her belly fat, potential lymph involvement on the second side and a cancerous pleural effusion, we are being proactive. So at least we don't have infusions to deal with...but the constant tick of taking a pill each day wears her down just as much We both really appreciate you taking a moment to share your experience. That is what has been getting us through optimistically... Because not much else seems to. ❤️",

Each story that I read her that echoes some truth from someone else's experience is this flicker of light in what is continuing to be just a really dark place. The cancer never got her down this much. But the pain in her arm is enough that I just want to find her some kind of relief. She's been trying to walk around, but it's so incredibly humid in the area that she can't handle going outside (and I don't blame her. I don't want her out there either). She's trying to do things in the kitchen and around the house, but everything is so hard when she's wrapped down to her individual fingers. Even feeding the dog is a terrible struggle and she winds up frustrated and annoyed and near tears because she just can't seem to do anything. She wants to exercise her arm, but the most that I can get her to do is flex her fingers without her going into bouts of talking about how much it's hurting. I've been big on hydration with her. It's the one thing I seem to be winning that battle. I'm glad that was a good choice. :) (That's been one thing I've done all along. Even when any part of this journey has seemed like it was spiraling out of control, I could always fill her water glass and tell her to drink.) Tomorrow I'm going to the LE therapist to talk to them now that we have a diagnosis on her shoulder and to understand the preferred course of treatment and the level of priority on taking care of the different parts of this process. I'll talk to them about water therapy, too. I don't know how my mom's going to feel about it, but I would imagine that the water could be one place that she actually feels like herself again. Plus, she used to love swimming when she was young, so maybe just having that sensation for however brief of a time could be a good influence. Binney, thanks for your explanation about the lymph fluid/inflammation. At least there is a reason that one is causing the other. It's so discouraging to go through these cycles, and even worse when nothing you're doing seems to get her any kind of relief. She's taking her pain pill and looks like she's about to start resting comfortably enough for the night. I'll take it. At some point something is going to have to give. All of this stinks. I'm sorry you've all experienced it, and wish you all the very, very best. <3",

It's not a large tumor, it's lots of small metastasis popping up all over her skin and in the pleural lining of her lung. She's had a pleurex installed and she's breathing a lot better than she was before. She got home from her hospital stay and her arm, which had been wrapped for the 6 nights she was in the hospital, opened up, so we had to deal with healing that. But now we are waiting for chemo to start next week. The doctor had originally wanted to get her enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral chemo, but she is unable to go through the testing necessary to be enrolled\u2014And the cancer seems to be a bit more aggressive than we'd hoped. Right now, she's really tired, sleeping a lot, and feeling uncomfortable. Nothing is really going to help until we can start fighting the disease. The oncologist was encouraging about the treatment, but we're increasingly anxious about it... Mostly because without doing anything, the cancer is visible on the skin and just keeps growing. It's gone from about 15 bumps along her scar to more than I can count wrapping the whole way around her body. She doesn't have any tumors in any other organs, so no radiation, no surgery on the table; just a systemic approach to fending off the beast a bit longer. Maybe (hopefully, I pray) a lot longer). I didn't think that lymphedema would lead to this. Thank you all for your support through this. We're coming up on 4 years since the first diagnosis. I'd always hoped for 5. Not my will, though. Thy will. And it will be done. I just hope she doesn't suffer.",

My younger brother is the same. They are both wonderful people, but not the best support. That said, I am enrolled in a yoga teacher training right now, and that's been really useful. We've spent a lot of time on philosophy and it is helping me put all of these new feelings into place. It's also given me a family of gorgeous women who are the most supportive friends I have ever had. Since my first post she woke up, ate some dinner, we re-wrapped her arm, and she has a bit more color. She's starting to snooze again, and we're watching the gymnastics competition, so I'm just taking in each moment as they come. Eating is rough because she's got such a full feeling all the time. Her breathing is changing all the time. Right now, she has one lung that's been radiated twice that we also did a pleuradesis on about a year ago. The other lung has the start of what is probably a cancer-filled pleural effusion. Together with the trunk swelling, it's causing extra compression on her lungs. She can breathe, she just gets short of breath, wheezes from time to time, and does abdominal breath when she's sleeping. There was some rattling this afternoon\u2014first time I heard that\u2014but it slowly faded away. So it could have just been the way she was positioned. Just so anxious for the treatment to start. It might be a week and a half or two weeks, but I'm hoping it happens faster than that. She might be getting a drain for her breathing issues in the meantime; that's why i was wondering if we should go to the hospital. She saw her PCP on Friday who recommended the drain but through a doctor, not a tech. I agree. But I think the drain is necessary pretty soon, and we just don't have an appointment yet. I don't think there's going to be a tech who can install it on a Sunday night, either, but at least she would be somewhere they are monitoring her. Now that she woke up, I feel less like I might need to make that happen right now. We're getting all of the previous treatments out of her system, so nothing is fighting anything in the meantime--which just feels so wrong. <3",

The chemo seems to be working; She's had some odd reactions (her sugar will drop, her blood pressure will rise), but for the most part, she's stable. Her tumor markers are falling, and the swelling is slowly reducing. The upper part of her arm is now supple, and the the fingers, hand and lower arm have all reduced; they aren't better yet, but it's slow steps in the right direction. She goes for her third chemo infusion on Wednesday and if all goes well, we're expecting the Oncologist to sign off on use of the flexitouch. Once cancer begins to be controlled, they say that it's safe to move the lymph around, and we may be able to reduce some of the swelling by resuming some massage. We want to make sure that's something her doctor's agree with, but for the most part, it seems like the jury is out as to if it's dangerous or not. We've had her wrapped pretty much constantly for the last 2 months and she's tolerating it so much better than she had been. I don't think it was lymphedema, I think it was lymphedema with cancer cells that made the past 2 months so miserable. We're hopeful right now that the chemo will continue to work and maybe she can regain at least a little bit of motion in her affected side. She does have a number of sleeves; light compression, tight compression, night garments, velcro garments\u2014We really did try everything\u2014but the gold standard\u20144 ace bandage wraps, beginning with fingers and going the whole way up the arm\u2014are the only thing that are doing the trick right now.

She has an appointment tomorrow afternoon, and I'm sure they will take a look at it; they will be sure to say they aren't doctors, though. I think we'll talk to her pcp in the morning. I am always more anxious about strange situations like this than I ought to be. My mom has always stayed so stoic and strong, but since the lymphedema started a lot of that resolve has been slipping away, which makes it harder for me to make judgement calls on if it's a normal crappy feeling or if it's one that needs to get to a hospital immediately. I think this one can wait until tomorrow",
