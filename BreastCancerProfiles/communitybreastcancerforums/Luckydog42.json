I was out in a chair and wheeled up to a mammography machine. Once they had me in the right position, I had the usual two shots to numb. Then they stick a small needle , take a picture with the mammogram machine, then if it is in the right spot, they release the seed. It was quick and easy. Afterwards, I was given a small bandaid. It looks like I got a shot; just a small dot on my breast. I took the bandaid off that day. If you had a biopsy, the seed placement will seem like a wall in the park. I feel this is more humane than having the wires placed. I would suggest asking for the very first surgery in the morning so they would not have time for the wires and instead would do the seed placement.",

It is like a lumpectomy but much smaller since there is no need for clean margins. Since the surgery is first thing Monday morning, there is no time for a wire placement on the healthy breast (yay!) and instead I will have a radioactive seed placed the Friday before my surgery date. I have no idea what to expect for the seed placement. I assume it is like a biopsy procedure? Has anyone had this seed placed before their surgery? I am a BIG baby when it comes to needles and it helps to mentally prepare for things like this.

The doctor that did the procedure asked if I was planning on having a lift on my healthy breast (yes) and if I knew how the plastic surgeon was doing the lift (no). He then placed the port a little higher than usual so that it would not interfere with the lift. So, it sounds like if the port is placed too low, it could cause a problem if you later have a lift.",
