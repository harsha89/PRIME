They were diagnosed in the early stages, both had mastectomies. I had a breast reduction 4 years ago, and due to the family history, I had to get a mammogram (this was at the age of 32). It came back normal. Just recently, in the last couple of days, I've been feeling some pain in my right breast, at the top/middle, just about 2 inches below my clavicle. If I lift my arm above my head, and palpate in that area, and to the right (toward my axilla), the pain increases, but it's not unbearable. It seems to be a dull, yet constant pain. I know there are lymphnodes in that area, and it may be swollen lymphnodes, maybe an infection. I was reading up on signs/symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer, and the swollen lymphnodes would be the only symptom I would seem to be having, none of the others apply. I was just wondering if anyone here has experienced similar symptoms, and if so, were you further diagnosed with breast cancer? My husband and I discussed this, and we agreed to wait a couple of days to see if the symptoms disappeared, and if they didn't, I would go to the doctor. Thanks for your time! ~Sara Log in to post a reply",
