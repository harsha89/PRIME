Lynn, I know that all cancer progressions are not the same, but I think I am in a similar boat to you.  Cancer was first diagnosed in my bones, 7 years after my intial BC diagnosis.  I had Lobular cancer.  I went on the usual hormonals.  Scans seemed to indicate that it was stable, however, my hemoglobin and hematocrit were dropping (as low as 25 and 7!) and my tumor marker was slowly rising.  Everyone was perplexed.  When I mentioned shortness of breath and horrible cramping in my back and legs to my onc, he scheduled a bone marrow biopsy which finally revealed that the cancer was not only in my bones, but my bone marrow as well.  Apparently in some cases, the bone marrow involvement does not show up on a scan. I don't know how much of the bone marrow was affected (my onc did not say), but I felt pretty awful.  From what I read, the treatment of progression to the bone and bone marrow are the same.  My onc did not get alarmed by the progression to the marrow so I didn't either.  We switched to Xeloda and it seemed to work immediately.  So well that he gave permission for me to go on a two week trip to Spain not long after I started. The Xeloda made me feel better for almost a year.  We realized that although I have widespread bone mets, my symptoms were mainly as a result of the progression to the marrow. Suddenly my tumor marker seemed to rise again, my counts started dropping, and I started to get the horrible cramping again. He put me on Procrit and ordered scans.  Again, scans showed nothing unusual but we knew what to do this time.  Not long after Affinitor was approved, my onc switched me to Affinitor and Aromisin.  I was dreading the horrible side effects I read about on this site, but I feel the best I have felt in years!  I have very little se -- if any -- and my tumor marker is coming tumbling down.  Also, my blood counts are the best they have been in almost two years -- I am creeping into the 30 range for hematocrit and haven't needed a Procrit shot in a few weeks!! So, don't worry too much.  Your treatments probably won't be that different from treatments for bone involvement.  Since the marrow progression actually affects your counts, your onc will probably try to combat that as best he can.  The good news is that you have another indicator (your blood work) to know if a treatment is working. Good luck!  Hope this helps",

It was not the sciatic nerve. I think that I had it during the day as well, but I felt it most at night. Each time I have gotten really anemic (as opposed to just anemic -- which I am the rest of the time!), it has corresponded to that feeling.  My onc is just happy that I am able to know when things are starting to happen so we can be proactive -- he didn't seem to have any patients who had described these symptoms, but then, bone marrow involvement is not terribly common. So, if you have cramping, it may not necessarily mean anemia or bone marrow involvement.  My anemia is not the run of the mill anemia.  It is hemolyisis (sp?), which means (as best as I can understand it) that the cancer prevents the red cells from circulating and kills them off. Hemolyatic anemia will not be cured by iron.  It will be \"cured\" by killing off the cancer in the marrow and letting the red blood cells do \"their thing\".  The nurses floated around a theory that seemed to make sense -- that the limbs furthest away were deprived of oxygen and that's why I was getting the cramping.  I also got shortness of breath.  Mostly I felt it when I was going up stairs or hills.  It was not totally debilitating -- I walk every day and just took it very easy going up hills.  My friend who I walk with is an internist and she would often take my pulse after I had gone up a hill and my heart was beating like crazy.  She did not seem alarmed but we would slow down. When I was really anemic, my lips would be very pale and the whites of my eyes would be pale as well.  Now that I am feeling better, my friends all tell me that I look much rosier now! I also think it was affecting my mood.  I was more tired than usual and just not energetic. I don't know if cramping necessarily means anemia or marrow involvement so I would not be too alarmed.  Again, my doctor -- who is very prominent in the Washington DC area -- did not seem to have many patients who had complained of just cramping and shortness of breath.  One of the nurses said that the procrit may have something to do with it... Also, these symptoms corresponded with very low hemoglobin and hematocrit counts. Lisa",

Also, I'm not sure if I was clear, but the fact that it did not show up on your earlier scans does not necessarily mean anything, and may not mean that it was progressing rapidly as you implied.  Mine never showed up but from how I felt and my tumor marker and my blood work, my onc knew something was wrong.  I imagine I have had it in my marrow for awhile but just started feeling the effects. Like the progression in our bones, it can't be CURED, but it can be reduced. Are you feeling any effects of the bone marrow involvement?  Short of breath?  As I said, I had horrible cramping in my body and I could feel when my counts were low.  I was exhausted -- not sleep all the time exhausted -- but just tired in general.  I had been very active and was forced to cut back on all my activities. So, good luck on the Affinitor.  Have you been on Xeloda yet?  As I said, that also worked for me.  The Affinitor, however, makes me feel GREAT and like a totally new person.  I keep asking my onc if there is something laced in it that is making me feel this good! Keep me posted, Lisa",

As you can see from the above post, the anemia I have is hemolytic anemia which means that the red cells are prevented by the cancer from circulating and delivering oxygen to th rest of the body. I think that they are made by the marrow but just can't do anything.  That's what generally causes shortness of breath, and probably, in my case, the cramping in my legs.  For me, the Affinitor/Aromisin combo seems to be killing off the cancer in my marrow. No amount of red meat or green leafy vegtables will make this anemia go away!  It has nothing to do with low iron. The nurses in my doctor's office look more at hemoglobin and hematocrit than at anything else as best as I can see.  My red blood count is not normal (VERY close though) and neither is my white count.  I guess its OK because I do not get sick very often.  The nurses do not seem bothered.  When I first began the Affinitor, my platelets dropped dramatically, however there was another count (neutrophils or lymphs I think) that showed that platelets were indeed being made in my body.  The platelets have since risen but are still not normal (they are about 106 now).  My doctor is not worried since the other count shows they are being made.  The platelet drop may be due to the Affinitor.  I can see the Catch-22 situation here that this drug is helping, but also affecting the platelets. Naniam is correct that you and I probably have a combination of bone marrow and bone mets. I know in my case that the bone mets have been relatively stable but that the bone marrow mets have been giving me the most trouble.  My tumor marker also seems to be a good indicator of the bone marrow progression -- it seems to climb when my hematocrit and hemoglobin start to drop and it goes down when they rise.  Just remember that the treatment is the same.
