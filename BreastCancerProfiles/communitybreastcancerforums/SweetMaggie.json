Thanks to everyone for all the good thoughts and hugs.  I guess I'm moving from TripAdvisor to BreastCancer.org for the foreseeable future.  I hope to one day be able to provide positive encouragement to others here, it really helps!

I just got an email from a friend I haven't seen in a while who went through her cancer journey several years ago (some kind of lymphoma) and she knows of a great place to get a wig.  I'm sure I will need chemo so I'm thinking heck, I might as well just cut my hair really really short beforehand and start with the wig.  Wondering if others do this... ChaoRains - yes, I am trying to doing the same, reminding myself to breathe...I will look for you here over the next few weeks.  ",
