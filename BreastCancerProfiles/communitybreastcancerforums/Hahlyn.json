While in there I mention my blood clot. After i mentioned the blood clot my side pain. Issue was set to the side. Urgent care doctor ran an ekg because my heart rate was high I told her since chemo it always is. She then sent me for another blood draw (i just gave blood yesterday for MO) asked isnt thst good enough No! My poor veins. I get the blood drawn and go back and im told I need hydration.maybe I do but I don't want to get an IV will have to get stuck again! Nobody listens..the nurse comes in i told him to use my right arm cuz they just used left for blood draw he says no as he is ripping the tape off my arm from the blood draw 15 minutes before. He then goes in it hurts but im dealing with it. He then calls in another nurse and something is wrong. He says I have to tske it out its not working. At the point I tell him I don't want hydration im okay I don't feel dehydrated like i did after my TCHP im okay. He tells the doctor and no hydration. Thank you. As for my blood clot finally got a prescription for lovenoX have to stick my self twice a day for 3 weeks. MO still doesnt believe I need it even though the urgent care doctor said you need mededication to treat the dvt. This is just a mess my surgey is Monday not sure if I should start the blood thinner, im so stressed. Asked about a port since picc line is gone I was told to ask BS if she can do during lumpectomy. Sweet Jesus I just dont have any more gas left in me im tired of the setbacks its just too much. So.now I have to hope and pray the bs will do port at the same time..otherwise I dont know how im going to continue the herceptin only treatment. I cant get stuck everytime there is NO WAY I can do that. Those of you that have ports can you give me some insight on the procedure and how it felt after and how your doing now with it.

I want to take this medicine and do whatever I can but I am freightend at the thought of explosive diarrhea and possible nausea.

I read the Jan group post and notice you will start chemo. Ive already gone thru it. 6 Cycles of TCHP and now I'm currently on Herceptin every 3 weeks. Chemo can be difficult but with your spirit you get through it. It's doable. My only tip is stay hydrated if you feel weak or notice yourself not intaking enough water or fluids request extra hydration from your MO. I had extra hydration twice a week after my infusions and it helped. Thanks again for stopping by (dont be a stranger) enjoy your Sunday and upcoming week! Hahlyn",

Surgery was longer than expected due to scar tissue. Not sure where scar tissue came from since I've never had surgery or trauma to my breast. Doctor said I did well during surgery and said I looked good today. After surgey I was starving and I was still hungry this morning. Good appetite. Thought due to anesthesia I would be nauseous but I wasnt. Havent had a bowel movement yet. Lot of urinating though. I have one drain that will be in for 2 weeks It is a little bigger than what I anticipated. Kind of hard to camouflage. Asked when I can drive I was told once I stop taking the narcotic pain pills which im taking as prescribed as i dont want the pain to get ahead of me. Hoping in about a week I can drive. Yesterday was a long day. Glad I remained in the hospital nice to have the nurses taking care of me. Now I'm on my own. Well my hubby will help but he returns to work tomorrow. Here's to a speedy recovery to all of us. Hahlyn",

My pre op is on Feb 21 have some questions i forgot to ask BS hoping can be answered like how long is the surgery will i stay overnight. Common questions i should have asked BS but i frazzled that day. Will write questions down this time. Have a good evening. ",

My husband bought me a recliner I was so happy and grateful until I sat in it. Lord it's so uncomfortable my back hurt so bad today. He is so proud of himself for buying It i just don't know how to tell him this chair is hurting me. To save face I will just try and put some pillows or just avoid it all together. I asked for a recliner I actually love them this hands down is the worse I have ever sat in. Anywho wishing continuous speedy recovery for all of us. Hahlyn",

My treatment plan called for me to have chemo first. My tumor was large unfortunately and both my MO and BS felt chemo first would be best to try and ahrink the tumor. I started chemo TCHP (Taxotere cardoplatin, herceptin, perjeta) I had 6 cylces every 3 weeks. I started sept 21 and I completed this regimen on jan 4 and now I have started receiving herceptin only every 3 weeks until September. There were some tuff days during chemo. I was hospitalized after my first treatment in September due to severe dehydration. You can almost never drink enough water. My MO scheduled me for hydration twice a week for 1 week after my treatments which helped. I lost 25 pounds (albeit i needed the pounds off) but not this way. Everyone side effects are different my worse of course the hair loss and diarrhea since September to date. Make sure if this a side effect you ask for hydration and prescription anti Diarrhea pills. That otc immodium does nothing. Even though chemo was brutal I made it, through Gods Grace and Mercy I made it! and so will you an anyone one elss who has to go down this road. I'm glad to see your doing okay after your lumpectomy it gives me hope. Happy Sunday i will be watching football today. Cowboys fan but will be rooting for the Falcons today! Enjoy your day ladies!",

I was able to have my herceptin treatment but right after my picc was removed. I asked is MOK prescribing meds for the blood clot and I was told no unless I'm in pain and there is swelling. Well there is both. I was hoping to get prescription before I left but nothing. When I got home I emailed MO telling I need meds I don't want this clot floating around in me. You know my nerves are just frayed at this point. They have to figure out how im going to continue the herceptin if I have this clotting issue. It was suggested a port but if I have this clotting deal they don't know. I guess I will have to get stuck 10 more times until the herceptin is over. This just sucks.. Praying for Gods favor.",
