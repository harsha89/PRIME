For two days it kept coming out when I squeezed just like a cyst. I had a breast exam and an ultrasound that all came back clear. 4 months later I felt pain again I squeezed and less came out and only that time. I don\u2019t know why I squeezed yesterday and a tiny itty bit came out. The discharge is white, thick, and strongly resembles a cyst or pimple discharge. I am constantly checking for bumps and don\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m still worried it can be cancer that\u2019s starting on the nipple. It only comes out from one breast, only when squeezed, but not every time it\u2019s squeezed, there a no crust on nipple or anything. I also hd blood exam and that came back back good. What should I\u2019m still worried i Log in to post a reply",
