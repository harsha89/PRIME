In other news, I've decided I need to have a big night out with my new body and bald head.  I'm a jeans and t-shirt kind of girl usually, no frills, but I'm going to put myself WAY out there and get all dolled up for an evening.  I bought a dress (gasp!) and everything.  I think it works really well with my flat chest, and it's something I never would have been able to wear with the old DD's.  I'm excited and petrified at the same time.  LOL  I'll let you all know how it goes.
