Yummy stuff! (((Hugs))) to everyone who is struggling with decisions -- it is so hard to sort through the statistical probabilities and to make choices.  Our age, our cancer Dx, our treatments and how we have tolerated them, and many other aspects of our personal situations figure in the decisions.  Know that you will do what is best for YOU, and once you decide, move forward with peace and confidence that we support you.   For what it is worth (and I am just a patient trying to understand this like all of you) my understanding of rads following chemo is that there may be rogue cells which had an immunity to the chemo, and the rads would zap those.  It is fair to ask this question (many thanks to another poster on another thread who had this in her list of questions for the RO):  What would be my risk of recurrence with rads vs. without rads, given the chemo and hormone treatments?  Also (in my case), since I had a lumpectomy with clear margins and no positive nodes! and since any future recurrence in the same breast would require MX if the breast has been radiated, if I forgo rads at this time, don't I keep the possibility of lumpectomy/rads in my arsenal of any future recurrence?  If that is true, please give the rationale for rads at this time. I asked the last question of my MO, and he said I should ask my BS.  He said the BS usually refers for rads after lumpectomy when she is unsure of whether there may be more cancer cells (particularly DCIS) lurking around or outside the tissue that was removed by LX.  I called my BS on Friday to ask if she would explain the rationale for rads at this time, but I didn't get to talk to her -- I will share her response once I connect with her.  ",

When I met with my MO, he said \"Radiation is radiation.  Once the program is figured out, someone just lines you up and turns on the machine.\" He suggested I go to the center where I have ended up because it is five minutes from home.  I do appreciate the convenience, and once the fatigue sets in, I know I will appreciate it A LOT.  I am just not impressed with the RO.  Oh well, 4 more weeks, 4 more meetings with him, and then I will be done.

Is partial breast irradiation an option for me? If not, why? Is an accelerated schedule an option for me? If not, why?(On both of these if it is because they don't offer it you may wish to seek care elsewhere if you are a candidate - Stage 1 no nodes) How much radiation in total will I receive? What type of equipment will you be using? (IMRT, 3D) What will you do to minimize the amount of radiation to my heart (more of a concern if your cancer is on the left side, like mine) Do you utilize breath hold to minimize heart exposure? What is the risk of second primary tumor from the radiation? What are the possible side effects of each treatment option, both in the short term and the long term? What can be done to relieve the possible side effects? (burning, fatigue mostly) How will this treatment affect my daily life? Will I be able to work, exercise, and perform my usual activities? How long after treatment will I return to normal activities? What is the risk of recurrence if I don't get radiation versus if I do? What is the survival rate if I don't get radiation versus if I do? If I get radiation and then get another cancer in that breast I will have to have an mastectomy because you can't usually get radiated twice in the same area. There is a study showing that older woman may not need radiation (if early stage, no nodes). If I don't have radiation and it reoccurs I could then have a lumpectomy and radiation. Explain your rationale for doing radiation now? Will you be able to accommodate my schedule (work, travel time, etc.) Can I take vitamins during rads? Biotin? MO wants to start hormone therapy during rads -- thoughts?",

Today was #20 for me.  I have 5 whole breast and 5 boosts left.  Going well -- I have a spotty rash on my girl and under the arm it is a nice reddish brown around the nodes incision.  But the skin doesn't hurt and seems to be holding up.  I get occasional moderate pain deep in my breast -- it only lasts a couple minutes and hasn't interfered with sleep so far.  No fatigue so far -- and I have actually felt more energetic as this week closes out and I see that so few zaps are left. Hoping all of you have a terrific weekend -- friends in the blizzard states, hang in there!  Looks like a relative heat wave is on the way for the end of next week!  Here is So Cal it was 80 degrees today -- makes it so stuffy to wear a hat, but I feel self conscious with only my little half inch of hair, so hats and wigs for now are still part of my wardrobe each day.",

Mcgis -- congrats on your last day tomorrow, if I got that right?  Whoooo Hoooo!!  Pocket party for sure!!!  Red, it's your turn to bring the bubbly!  Check in with us, Mcgis, and let us know what it feels like to be D-O-N-E!!!! So nice to see that we have a group on the same schedule just starting out last week -- you all can compare notes as you go along.   Sbp -- I have worked throughout my chemo and rads treatments (I am a professor) out of the necessity to support my family.  Staying home was really not an option.  In the end, although there have been some difficult days, I think I have gotten through it easier because I was working.  It gave me a reason to get up and get dressed, and once I was at the University, I always had more energy and plenty to distract me from feeling sorry for myself.  I think if I was at home the time might not have passed as quickly for me -- but that is just me.  Everyone has to decide for herself what is the best course, but most important is to listen to your own instincts for what is best. Lily, as some others have said, CBC (blood count) test results are helpful for the docs as they can see how well our bodies are rebounding from the treatments.  I learned a lot about blood counts during chemo.  Rads can impact blood count as well -- it is important to eat well and to drink a lot of water and other fluids, since your body is working hard to repair the damage from the rads zaps (the zaps don't only get cancer cells, they damage healthy cells too -- but given the right fuel in the form of a good diet and fluids, new healthy cells can grow, where the cancer cells just die off -- at least that's the plan). Fur, good to see you again -- I am about 9 weeks post chemo and have about a half inch of hair -- it is so exciting to see that fuzz coming in, isn't it?  I can't wait until I have enough to actually look like it is a hairstyle so that I can sometimes go out without a wig or hat. Annika - I have always hated Mondays, and BC has made my attitude worse.  But try to keep your eyes on the prize at the end, and cross those days off the calendar, Mondays and all the other ones.  Treat yourself so something for each week when you make it through! Hope you all had good weekends -- all of you in the frozen Northeast, please be careful, and everyone have a week of smooth sailing with treatments.  (((((Hugs))))) to you all!!",

Update -- I am 10 days past last rad, and pain free at last.  The area of my boost was sore until yesterday.  Outside of the boost area, the rest of my boob has peeled mildly, and settled into a nice suntan -- if only my fluorescent white body had a matching glow!  One spot in my scar is kind of red, but strangely, after the peel, the rest of my scars are less noticeable than they were before rads.  Another interesting thing -- I had a lot of small moles on my breast which grew larger during chemo and rads.  Both MO and RO said not to worry, so I didn't.  Most of them have either peeled off almost entirely or have shrunk since rads ended....  Weird!  ",

A month post-rads, and my girl has a tan, but otherwise looks better than before she got fried.  I peeled afterwards, as some have described here, and the scars looked so much better after the peel!  I am still getting the occasional zinger, and it seems like the tissues in my breast are firmer than before, especially in the area which was targeted by the boosts.  I had been afraid the skin would continue to get worse after the last rads zap, but it really just improved everyday. Signs of Spring are all around (even saw some robins in upstate NY....but they looked a little confused by the cold).  I hope the increasing warmth and the hope the sprouts with Spring buoys us all and brings a smile to your faces.  Be kind and loving to yourselves, radiant ones! Hugs!  --Kim",

SDB -- lol -- duct tape for the wig!!!  Hahaha!!!  I had some difficulty at work one day, walking to my car against the wind with one hand on my head to keep the dumb thing on (and somewhat centered).  I am a professor, and loathe to have students see me with bald head.  But the minute I got in my car I pulled off the wig with some choice words and flung it into the backseat!  I don't blame you for dreading the long drive to radiation -- understandable that you would avoid thinking about all that inconvenience.  Good luck with your meeting tomorrow as well -- maybe you will be a candidate for accelerated schedule which would spare you a LOT of commuting back and forth. So, radiant pals, please be in my pockets tomorrow to give me strength.....I have plans to tell my MO tomorrow that I am not going to take the risk of any further infusions -- for someone with my Dx and pathology, I was borderline for chemo anyway.  I have had 3.5 out of 4 treatments, and any teensy benefit that I might get from a tx with Gemzar or Taxotere tomorrow is more than overshadowed by the substantial risk of severe allergic reaction.  My instincts were along thse lines as I have been researching my rash/hives and fevers, but today I saw my PCP internist on another matter and decided to walk through the whole chemo allergy thing with him.  He said that the risk of reaction outweighs the benefit, especially since I had negative nodes and clear margins.  So unless my MO can give me some kind of extremely compelling reason to attack me one last time with chemicals, I am done with chemo.  ",

As far as healing from surgery, you might want to also join Lumpectomy Lounge where the \"Lumpies\" can chime in for advice on healing.  My surgery was lumpectomy with \"rearrangement\" -- they took a wedge of tissue from the BC breast and did some reconstruction at the same time, so it was a bit more extensive.  It took three weeks before I could sleep in a bed rather than recliner.  Swelling was down after about a month and \"zingers\" (pains from the nerves healing) took a couple months to go away.  One spot in my incision was especially slow to heal, and I was still messing around with that spot for about 10 weeks. Everyone is different, as you will learn -- different cancers, different surgeries, different doctors, different bodies -- but we do have in common that we are fighting the common enemy: BC.  I hope you find it helpful to join with other warrior sisters!",

I just talked to my BS, who I love because she speaks plain English, but at the same time she doesn't minimize my questions and treats me like an intelligent partner in my treatment.  I asked her to explain why I need rads now, given my Dx, clear nodes and margins, etc..... She says that it is all according to the statistical probabilities.  MX leaves the patient with about  1-3% chance of recurrence in the same breast, while LX with surgery only leaves about 30% chance of recurrence.  Statistics show that with radiation added, the LX chance comes down to 6% or less for that breast.  Surgery and rads are for local recurrence, confined to the breast only.  Chemo -- when testing on the tissue indicates it would be effective -- further reduces the chance of recurrence.   In my case I was told by the MO that after surgery, with no further treatment, my chance of recurrence was about 30%.  The chemo, rads and hormone therapy take it down to 4%.  Since chemo and hormone therapies are systemic, they also impact the other breast, where rads does not.  So there is some grist for the mill for everyone who is trying to sort this out (like me).  I figured 4% chance of recurrence was pretty good, so I wanted to throw the whole arsenal at this thing. Oncearunner, since I had her on the phone, I also asked my BS about finding the cancer site, and she said the rearrangement of tissue was not so extensive that they would not be able to find the place where the cancer had been located, and that boosts are a standard part of the post-lumpectomy rads treatment.  ",

      "Content": "Jan 16, 2014 02:14PM - edited Jan 16, 2014 04:15PM by TeamKim Congrats to those who are D-O-N-E!!!!!!!  How I envy you ladies!  And so glad to hear some of you are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel....  Here's to smooth sailing the rest of the way.   Leslie, I wish I had some insights for you -- hopefully some others on this board will.  The Lumpectomy Lounge thread has many comments on seroma, so you might get some advice there.  I think it would be worth a call to your BS, if only to ease your mind. Wanted to give you all an update on the questions I asked my MO today and take through rads and beyond.  He wrote me a prescription for Tamoxifen, which I am to start now.  He says that Tamoxifen SEs, if I have them, are completely different from rads SEs so there is no way that I could be confused about what is causing any SEs.  He also believes that if I get any SEs from Tamoxifen, rads will not make them worse, or vice versa.  If I am miserable on Tamoxifen, he said to come back in and he will switch me to something else. He also plans to put me on Zometa (I have osteopenia) for bone strength, and he said that recent research has shown that Zometa also helps to prevent cancer recurrence.  I was on Actonel before chemo, and that was a once per week pill.  Zometa is a brief IV infusion, once every 6 months (I like not having to remember to take a once per week pill).   It can have some jaw necrosis SEs, so I need to check with my dentist and get teeth cleaned before I start.   Finally, I asked about the neuropathy, which still bothers my three middle toes on both feet.  He said to give it another couple of weeks, and if it is not improving, call him and he will give me a shot of B-12.  He said B-12 is the first line of attack to try to make the nerves more happy happy.   So, for what it's worth, that's the info from my questions today -- maybe it will help any of you with similar concerns.",

LUNG/HEART -- while the tech was explaining the machine to me, I thought I would ask about how/if it protects my heart and lungs.  He said to definitely ask the RO when I see him next Thurs, but he broke out the photos from my CT scan last week and showed me the area to be radiated from several views.  My lungs and heart were clearly visible.  He showed me a small area where the radiation will cross the edge of my lungs during the whole breast rads -- I asked if that will cause scarring, and he said it shouldn't, but to ask the RO as well.  Boosts, he said, will not pass through the lungs at all and the heart will be out of the way for all rads. TIME -- When I was there last week I asked for 3:30 time slot and explained why earlier was not possible with work.  Sure enough, I got the 3:30 time.  Tech says I will be out of there by 4:00 except on Thursday when I see the RO after being zapped. SKINCARE -- Once I got my tattoos, I met with the RO's nurse, who went over skincare.  She recommended Miaderm 3 times per day starting with first day of treatment, and then for later weeks of treatment to add in aloe Vera and Aquaphor in between.   I asked about Emu Oil, and she had never heard of it but she thought it would probably be fine as addition to the others.  She said my skin seems \"baby soft\" so I should be religious about the creams.  Those of you using Miaderm, did you find any less expensive sources to buy?  Ordering direct from Miaderm (2 tubes) is $71.34 including tax and free shipping.",

If you choose to wear a bra, definitely no underwire, and I even found that bras with seams where the underwires would be are irritating too.  But then I have a scar in exactly the place where the underwire would be.  So I suppose it depends a bit on your surgery site and whether you have SNB scars, etc.  ",

I need the extra time, expense, etc, right?  All of the energy it has been taking to stay strong and keep going just evaporated, and I was a mess for about an hour.   But I think the tears were cathartic -- I have been putting on the brave face, haven't cried about this whole stupid thing for months, so I felt better after.  My DH was really dismayed, and he is never good when I cry (all he needs to do is hug me, but that never occurs to him).   I think I scared him with the depth of my pain, and he felt helpless.  He has been hyper efficient about trying to help with the ticket, doing a lot of research on it today -- his way of trying to do something.   So I don't know about you guys, but I am taking a page out of Scarlett O'Hara's book (from Gone with the Wind, if any of you are old like me and know the book/movie).  Whenever things got tough for Scarlett, she would square her shoulders with determination, and if she couldn't immediately solve the problem, she would \"think about it tomorrow.\"  And somehow, just making it to tomorrow makes us feel like we can make it to the next day too....",

The techs will position your arm so that it will not be touched by the rads machine as it moves around you (it doesn't move while it's emitting radiation, but it will move into different positions/angles in order to effectively deliver the rads), then when they have your arm in the right position, they do something that firms up the material in the beanbag and, voila, that will be the mold they use so that your arm is in the same position every time. 2) The CT Scan - This should not take too long...but you will be asked to hold your breath at some point (I'm pretty sure everyone having the CT sim has to hold their breath even if they're not doing gated breathing). The breath-hold could be several seconds (maybe 20 - 30; mine was for 45 seconds), but it's totally doable. Let your techs know if you have any anxiety about claustrophobia. The CT sim machine is in a ring shape with openings on both sides, so you won't be in there as you might in an MRI. 3) The tattoos - The last thing they will do is place permanent little black dot tattoos in the areas where they will line you up for every rads session. I noticed that, on the side where I had 2 nodes removed, I hardly felt the tattoos going in at all, but on the side where I had only one node removed, I felt it a little bit. A tiny bee sting and then it was gone. Hmmm...about the timing - I would want to make sure you are totally healed. You may do very well, skinwise, in rads...but some people have moderate to severe skin issues as a result...you would want to have healed skin before it could possibly become compromised by radiation. I think most people feel comfortable starting around 6 weeks, so if it's possible to give yourself that extra week, I would. Here's a link to a site that discusses suggestions for food dos and don'ts during radiation. http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/what-should-breast-cancer-patients-eat-during-radiation-treatment%3f Hope this helps! Don't worry - you will be just fine! Synchronous Bilateral Breast Cancer, No Chemo, Gated Breathing (Deep Inspirational Breath Hold) Radiation Therapy",

Gemzar is used for a number of cancers -- most notably pancreatic cancer -- not just BC. Believe me, I lobbied to just be done -- but MO thought that wasn't a good idea.

JM -- It is an interesting question about the under inflation of the non-Randiant breast.  Since the field of radiation extends to the center of the breast where further inflation of the non-radiant breast would probably stretch radiated skin and given your PS's concern with scar tissue, I think I would be inclined to keep the twins on the same inflation schedule -- might be worth a 2nd RO opinion as MinusTwo suggests.",

RoseCal -- I started Tamoxifen already, and I am postmenopause (age 59) and have mild osteopenia.  To counteract the bone loss effects which are possible from Tamoxifen, I am getting an infusion of Zometa every 6 months.  Zometa, in addition to helping bone density (like Boniva or Actonel), also has a preventative effect for cancers (not just BC, but some others as well).  My MO says I will be on Tamoxifen for 5-10 years.  He encouraged me to chat with some of my other doctors about the pros and cons of this regimen, so I called my BS, my GYN, and also talked to my dentist (Zometa can cause jaw problems if you have diseased teeth, so I needed a thorough dental exam to get the green light).  All the other docs seconded the treatment plan, so I feel pretty comfortable with it.  No SEs from the Tamoxifen so far, except a little mild ovary pain in the first week.",

JM -- good job speaking up and telling them to get on the same page for heavens sake!  We have to be our own advocates in these things, and your instincts were spot on. Thanks for the Domedoro tip everyone -- my worthless RO (sorry, but I am really disappointed in him) never suggested that, and I have been itching for a couple of weeks here.  Last night I had a tiny bit of peeling right at the edge of my nipple and it was very tender, but itched too (weird).  I put on Miaderm before bed, covered it with plenty of Aquafor and put a teensy dot of Neosporin on the spot that peeled.  Then I took two extra strength ibuprofen and went to bed hoping for the best.  This morning the sore spot was gone (weird again).  I think I will Google Domedoro and see where I can get some -- I only have 4 more whole breast and 5 boosts to go....  Crossing those days off the calendar.....",

Mostly it is just the chore of it...everyday.....drive there....undress...get on the table for the healing light....lube...get dressed....drive home....lube,lube,lube.....it wears you down, and that's the fatigue.  I feel like chemo made me yucky in a systematic way, whereas the discomfort I occasionally have from rads is localized and that makes it a little more tangible, at least so far. Jmfrankel -- thanks for giving us the detail of your skincare regimen.  Glad it is working for you, especially with the bolus giving your skin more of a direct shot.

The tech who did my CT scan didn't know how they protect the heart, but he did know that they don't do rads in the prone position at my facility.  So at my first treatment, I asked the rads tech.  He got out the pictures from my CT scan and treatment plan which show the field of radiation from various angles.  He showed me that my heart is blocked by the machine, and that a sliver of my lung would be exposed to radiation.  A couple days late, I also asked my RO the same question and he showed me the same photos and explained it the same way.  I asked if there would be scarring in the lung in that spot, and RO said yes, but it is a very small area and will not affect lung function or health going forward. My MO told me that this radiation facility recently got this machine that blocks your heart so that you don't have to hold your breath.  So there are different types of machines, which accounts for the differences in having the gated breathing or not.  My MO said the physics that generates the computer program and treatment plan is very complex. I am guessing that the location of your cancer tumor bed makes a difference to all this as well.  My IDC area was close to the chest wall, and the margins in my surgery -- though they were clear -- were the smallest at the chest wall.  That is the reason my field of radiation goes through a sliver of my lung, so that the chest wall is radiated in that spot. Don't be shy about asking to see the treatment plan and the pictures -- in fact, I am thinking of asking for a copy of mine.  As the patient, you have a right to see anything in your chart and have it explained to you.",

I had my surgery July 30 and it just finally healed all the way this week. Another difference from a regular lumpectomy was that I had a drain after surgery, which was removed at my first appointment one week after. Fephna is right, the healing takes a little longer, but I traveled across the country 3 weeks after surgery to take my son to college and I had no problems with traveling at all. I slept in a recliner for the first two weeks, then propped a travel pillow under my side so that I wouldn't roll in bed. Since I only had one done, I could sleep on the other side, but only recently (after 6 weeks) have been comfortable sleeping on the surgery side. I have no pain in my breast at all at this point -- I would say the pain from surgery was only about two days of needing prescription meds, then about a week of Tylenol. The glue all came off after about 3 weeks, and at that point I had the little pea-sized spot that took a long time to heal. Used the Neosporin with a bit of gauze over it, held in place by my bra (my skin was sensitive to the bandaid adhesive), and that has gradually cleared it up. So hope all that info helps you, DawnCT. So sorry about the bad margins -- keeps you marking time in the surgery phase when you just want to get on with life! Good luck, and ask away if you have questions!",

The nurses and anesthesiologist were awesome in prep, and my BS and PS came in and while the PS was drawing on me with his purple marker they talked with me about their plans for the surgery. I was so reassured by the way they were in sync and by how they included me in the discussion! Same with post op -- PS and BS talked with DH, and I was well cared for by terrific nurses in post op. If my experience is any indicator, you will be a bit of a couch potato for a couple of days, but then paperwork and little tasks like Christmas cards will be a welcome distraction as you continue to heal. Once you get off the pain meds (48 hours for me) and use Tylenol instead, you are over the worst of it. Make sure to have something on hand for constipation (Colace worked for me). By one week after surgery I could drive, and range of motion on my left side came back gradually over about 6 weeks. To give you an idea, 3.5 weeks after my surgery I went with my DH to take my son to move in at college on the other side of the country -- other than being a little tired a couple of times, I was fine. Thanks for asking about rads.... I am not there yet. I had to have chemo first, and will have my 2nd of 4 tx on Thursday. Compared to how bad it could be, I have been lucky with mild SEs so far. Lost my hair this week, though, which is a bummer. I will finish chemo by Christmas, then start rads three weeks later. I'll be thinking of you on Tuesday, sending prayers and wishes for a restful Monday night, little pain and easy recovery!",

      "Content": "Nov 1, 2013 10:31AM TeamKim wrote: Hi Dawn -- I have been thinking of you and hoping your surgery went well and recovery is going nicely. A couple of hints.... 1) they send you home in a surgical bra of some sort, and I was told to wear it night and day for one week, then to switch to a sports bra. I had a sports bra, but it was not as soft as the surgical bra and it cut across the SNB incision and that was not comfortable. About 5 days after surgery, I ended up going to Target, gathering up all the potential bras in my size and a little bigger, and trying them on -- it was a bit of a hassle with my drain dangling from the dressing room door on a hanger, but I managed. Ended up with two soft comfortable bras that I have worn for 6 months. Some women also buy one in one size larger to go on the outside so they can insert an ice pack in between the two bras. My ps/BC team said NOT to ice my girl, so I didn't do that. 2) my shoulder on the surgery side was very stiff for a couple of months. BS said that was from holding my boob like a running back headed for the end zone. Try to relax that shoulder and put out arm down to your side, even slightly swing it when you walk. When sleeping and sitting, use a pillow to provide support, rather than holding the girl with your hand and arm. I got a sausage-shape travel pillow at Target which was great for this. -- filled with pellets which molded to whatever shape I needed. Also good for riding in the car -- when you go over a bump, you feel it for a few weeks. 3) Keep incision area below your breast dry as possible once your dressings come off. This might not be a problem this time of year so much, but my surgery was in the heat of summer and I tend to perspire there. At the point where the incisions come together like an inverted T at the bottom of my breast, I ended up with a spot that took several weeks longer to heal. Once I was dealing with that I learned to put my blow dryer on cool setting and blow that area dry, then cover it with a folded piece of soft gauze, held on by my bra, to keep it dry. Any crusty bits on the incision can get a LIGHT smear of Neosporin to speed healing as well. Hope that helps! --kim",

They took out a wedge of tissue (like a piece of cake) and scooted the remaining breast tissue together. The nipple was preserved and repositioned. I am left with an anchor-shaped scar all the way around my areola, vertical below the nipple and in the lower curve of my breast. The scars are very fine, and disappearing more and more as time passes. The BC (left) breast was originally larger than my right breast and now that the surgery has been done, they at about the same size, but the nipple his higher on the left breast, so it appears more perky (lol). Since rads can shrink the breast, I am waiting until about 6 months after all treatments have ended to see if I want a little breast lift on the right breast to even them out. The oncoplasty (BS and PS working together) and any reconstruction I have done after are covered by insurance. I was very pleased with the procedure -- a lot of artistry involved, and I was glad my Bs and PS collaborate often on this surgery...they do great work together.",

Right now the only difference between the two boobies is the BC boob nipple looks about a 1/2 inch higher. Volume and texture and feeling in both is the same. Scars are disappearing almost -- much more attractive than I had expected! PS says rads may lift the BC breast a bit more, but shouldn't be too much change. I am very pleased!",

Do let us know how the \"rearrangement\" holds up. By the way, my MO, who didn't realize I didn't have a traditional lumpectomy, started in telling me how rads would pull the girl toward my underarm and distort/scar/etc. Once I explained, he took that back, and said there would be some firming of the tissue with rads. He also said going forward that imaging (mammograms/MRIs) would also be easier and more comfortable since I had the oncoplasty.",

My PS said you don't really know how she will be until about 6 months after radiation. He said at that point if I want a little work done on the non-BC breast to even them up, it will still be considered reconstruction as far as insurance is concerned. Talk to your PS about your options if you aren't happy -- but be aware that things will change still. My surgery was in July, and I don't think my girl was completely healed and softened back up until late September. But I know there are more changes to come....

But in the long run, if you picked up an infection from the kids, you would take even more time to march through this recovery. Yogagal, I hope the infection is responding to treatment. Keep your eyes on the finish line. This is a temporary setback, and you should slow down and take the time to heal. I had my first chemo infusion Thursday, and while the weekend has not been a piece of cake, the SEs were not as bad as I had imagined. They say you don't really know how your body will react until you go through the first treatment, then you have a blueprint of sorts. My biggest challenges were constipation and cramps, fatigue on day 3, and a persistent headache. This morning, I seem to have developed a yeast infection, so will need to deal with that today. I'll be teaching my classes tomorrow, and for the rest of the week. I decided to tell my students what was going on with me because I will be losing my hair in a couple weeks and it will be obvious, plus some rearranging of our syllabi was needed to accommodate my tx. They have been great, with lots of notes and emails of support. One class even organized a surprise send off to my first chemo -- they all wore pink, read inspirational quotes, made me a blanket to snuggle under, and even contacted my husband and son to participate! It was so wonderful to have all those young people in my corner as I was off to the first infusion! So far, so good.....",

Now you can get going with treatment and see the light at the end of the tunnel (and it's not a train!) Welcome nahelton12 -- I am medium-size, so mine is a different situation, kind of. In my case, the incision went all the way around the areola, straight down the bottom of my breast at 6:00 and then a curved incision in the crease along the bottom third of my breast (like the shape of an anchor). As the PS was marking me before surgery (he took a purple marker and drew what he was planning) he was talking with the BS about how to preserve the blood supply to the nipple since one of my BC areas (I had 2) was close to the nipple. What was interesting to me was that the wedge of tissue that was removed, containing both areas of BC was about at 3:00, but there is no incision there. SND was done through a smaller incision more in my underarm area, and then I had a small incision about 1 1/2 in below the breast where the drain came out. I was surprised to learn, when my BS removed the drain, that it wrapped all the way around my breast! Sometimes I think doctors do so many of these procedures that they forget all the information that we don't know, so ask your questions! Both of you, one thing that I just remembered was that the entire breast was pretty numb for the first couple of weeks after surgery, and it felt solid -- not exactly hard, but certainly not soft. When the little zinger pains began, it also began to soften up and the feeling returned. Now, two months after, the texture is back to normal -- just like the other breast, but not as droopy -- lol! All feeling has returned except along the 6:00 incision.",
