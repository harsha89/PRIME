I would just like to say that I have now touched base with a leading radiology oncologist, one Karol Sikora, and he kindly wrote back to me in reference to the matter itemised above stating: \"I should preface my response by saying don't panic! The DD radiotherapy simply can't cause brachial plexopathy. It's too low a dose anyway and the scattered radiation received under the collar bone will have been negligible.\" Hopefully this information may be of interest/value to anyone else in a similar situation. Bless you for ALL. Cheers, Meunier",

I have a question if I might ... and I don't know exactly where to turn. Perhaps you might be good enough to help me. (If you just laugh and say 'please go away' I will I promise absolutely understand.) My situation is this. In mid January 2016 I, a 60 year old Caucasian male, found a small lump in the middle of the palm of my left hand. (I'm in the UK I should note with its failing NHS.) It was small. The lump that is. No one else would really notice. I waited a few weeks to see if it would just go away of its own accord but it didn't. I made an appointment with my GP. He said it was 'trigger finger' and I could have steroid injections if I wanted or just wait and see. Somehow that didn't seem right to me as I thought I could sense small callus like lumps under my litter and ring finger on my right hand too. I looked these up on the internet and found Dupuytren's Contracture/Disease. The last thing on earth I wanted was a contracture. (Blessedly I still don't have one). I didn't know what to do ... and what I was reading and seeing in pictures made me panic. (I'm an expert at panic.) I turned to the International Dupuytren's Disease Forum. I read there that many people had been successfully treated with radiation and that it had obliterated the DD in 83% of cases. I went to see a private radiology oncologist. He said I had very early Dupuytren's Disease (DD) in my left hand and even earlier in my right hand. He signed me up for a package deal. I had two sessions of 3gy each on both my hands. I was feeling distinctly strange about the treatment. They had been a little too eager to sign me up and get my (many) monies. I decided to stop the treatment because I found someone in the UK for whom the radiotherapy programme had failed and who had turned to a massage therapist who specializes in DD. Her DD (and she had previously had breast cancer) had now been contained for some years through the massage therapy. I also went to a second private radiation oncologist for a second opinion. He said that I didn't need treatment on my right hand at all ... and that I should just wait and see vis a vis the left . I have carried on with the massage therapy since - I have had three sessions - and the lumps on the right hand have all but disappeared (they were ever only below the skin line) and the small lump on the left palm has remained stable if not even shrunk and the small amount of puckered skin surrounding it has risen back - or is rising - back to its normal surface. I am well pleased. . The reason I am posting here is because approximately two weeks after I had that 6gy of radiation (two sessions of 3gy each delivered in two minute sessions in very glitzy surrounds) I was sitting at my desk and suddenly felt an painful electric shock in my right elbow. Shortly thereafter I felt an electric shock in my right shoulder area. I also for a couple of days had intermittent tringling/crawling sensations over the top of my right hand. Happily these have not now reoccurred. That said I have sensed - and I stress sensed as I know full well I could easily pass any hospital neurological examination even as I currently am - that my right arm is weaker than my left - even though I am it's true capable of lifting all that I could before. Definitely I have had muscle tightness in the right forearm. I should explain that I do have some severe foraminal stenosis - certainly not at anyone's surgery stage - on my left side ... and I had a renewed MRI with the results last week which now tells me I have an impinged nerve at C6 (very common) on the right side - which had always been my better region. (Funnily my neck does not hurt ... and I am really not at the moment in any what I would call - by any measure - extreme pain ... or, indeed, any pain ... just a discomforting tightness. Certainly I am not taking any medication for such. I have of late - and I DO know why - become anxious (something I'm good at) that I might well have led myself (well, my right arm) down the RIBP garden pathway by virtue of those two radiation bouts on my left and right palms. You know so, so very much better than me. Am I being fanciful? I will I promise understand completely if you tell me I am being so. Comparatively speaking I had so little radiation. (I was scheduled to have two segments of 15gy each on both hands, i.e., a total of 30yg on each) You may be howling. If so, I suppose that is no bad thing. In ANY event bless you for your kind understanding ... I am in awe at your courage - truly I am - and the largess you continue to bestow on an ever burgeoning many. Bless you for ALL. Meunier",
