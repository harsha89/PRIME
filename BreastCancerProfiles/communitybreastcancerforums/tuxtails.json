First of all, please drink plenty of water, I feel that helped me alot. I started with pure Aloe Vera several times a day, now I am using Aquaphor. Momtotenkids, you may want to start applying some Aquaphor if you are feeling irritated already. Today was the first day I went to work without a bra! I wore a tank top under a big loose soft sweater. I didn't get red/irritated until week 3 and I haven't been real fatigued either. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables; broccoli, brussel sprouts, tomatos and fruits too. Fresh air/walks will keep the energy up. I hope the best to you all, just take good care of yourself and you will do just fine. Anyone with some \"boost\" info?",

Two more to go! Your first boost will take a little longer, they want to make sure it is all lined up properly and the RO came in and gave it his ok. The redness/soreness is gradual and I hear the it will heal 4-6 weeks, the radiation is still in there working. Best of luck to you all and pamper yourself! T",

It has been a week and a half since I finished, healing going well. I must say I got raw and uncomfortable afterwards, but it clears up fairly quick. I only have a small red, sore area around my incision. If you can wear a bra, slather on the aquafor, place a folded soft cotton hankie over your breast...your bra will keep it in place and it keeps the aquaphor from getting all over. Wishing you all the best and a quick recovery....keep drinking lots of water! Tux",

My skin is sore and red, but it is already starting to form scabs in some places and is looking alot better. The Aquaphor helps soothe and shields the skin, been going topless at home...tech said to try and air out when possible. When you get to your boosts, since the rads in being targeted for the incision site, the rest of your breast gets a break and starts to heal, so don't get discouraged. Keep drinking water, it will help hydrate your skin and you will  heal faster. T",

I am replacing my radiation count down calendar with my count down to hiking in Washington state with my son. We did the Continental Divide last year before I was diagnosed, my life has changed alot since then for sure. So hang in there,  I'll be waiting at the end of your finish line! God bless you all!",

Adagio, Savannah is really beautiful right now and not too hot to visit. All of the azaleas and dogwoods are in bloom. Don't visit after May, starts getting humid and will stay that way until September. The best time is mid March to the end of April. I'll be up your way in July to visit my son and conquer Mt. Ranier. I noticed the most changes going into week three and I can't say enough how important the water drinking is...told by Drs and my sister is a nutritionist, got to keep those tissues hydrated and flush any toxins out of the body. Once treatment is over, vitamin C, E and D Good luck to you all! T",

I told her I would come, but the Dr needed to call me back TODAY and tell me the results. Of course I had the worst case scenarios going through my mind. I too work in a open office with no privacy at all, I was concerned how my employers would react. Well the Dr called me on my cell phone at work around 4:00 and gave me the news. I told him I was relieved to know what I was dealing with, even if it was cancer. I now had the power to research and get ready for my fight. The unknown is terrible! But what happened after I hung up the phone and went to talk to my supervisor was amazing. Every single person in that place has been supportive and caring, even two cold/grouchy men that own the company! They have given up their close parking spots so I can park there during radiation treatments! Don't give up on your work situation, people really care when things get really tough.

Take care of yourself and you are doing the right thing by checking out options. I too, like Sjw1, revamped my diet and eat a plant based diet, can't hurt and I feel alot better too. You will find your inner strength and make it through this. Allow others to help you and nurture yourself. Keep us posted on your surgery....HUGS! Tux",
