I know many people have had good success with the talc procedure. In my mom's case, however, we've had two oncs recommend against it. They say it can be very painful and is only successful 50% of the time. That being said, Donna--I'm glad it's worked well for your sister. My mom's pleural effusion is encapsulated now from having it drained for so many years so many times, but she's willing to live with it that way.  It's so hard to say when the end will come for any particular patient. With my mom, she's been close to dying several times over the past couple of years, but has been able to rally back when we've found a chemo that works for her. Pleural effusions are like any other mets--if you can get it under control, then things will be OK. If not, then yes, it's the beginning of the end. Lanef, my heart goes out to you, because I feel the same way about my mom. She's turning 69 next month, and it will be really hard on me and my kids (5 1/2 and 9) when she does go. My dad died of pancreatic cancer, and between him and my mom, I can truly say that their cancers have been more stressful for me than my own.  Hugs and prayers to you and your mom. ",

As far as CA27.29 goes, the number isn't as relavant as the trend in the number. You can have mets and be in the normal range for the marker. However, an upwards trend in the marker can indicate the need to scan for possible mets or progression of mets. There are things other than cancer that can elevate tumor markers--such as inflammation--so they're not 100% accurate, which is why not all oncs use them.  ",

As far as a biopsy on something that doesn't show on imaging (although the MRI should pick it up), I think the surgeon can do it by feel if necessary. I'm not 100% sure.

So it's good your doc is taking things seriously. Better safe than sorry. When I originally found my lump, the idiot girl at my OB office told me it would be 6 weeks before I could see the doc. I had to push and push, and as it was, it took a month before I got diagnosed. At any rate, your biospy should come back within a week, if not faster. Labs differ in their response time, of course.

I know another woman from www.her2support.org who was about two weeks from death with extensive mets to the liver--she, too, was put on Xeloda, and is now doing extremely well five years later. So it can happen--you don't know until you try.  The advantage of Xeloda for you mom is that it's oral--she won't have to go in for infusions, and she won't be loading up her body with extra fluids from infusions, which can make her pleural effusions worse. In addition to Xeloda, there is also Gemzar, Carboplatin, Cisplatin, Navelbine, Taxol, Taxotere, Abraxane, Doxil, and Ixempra to try. If all she's been on is hormone therapy, I think it's worth giving chemo a shot. There isn't anything to lose, and a lot to gain, if your mom is up for it. It has to be her decision.  Good luck to both of you--<<<<>>>>>",

But that was because the tumor was growing into the chest muscle, and I think I felt it pulling on the muscle. It drives me crazy, though, when people spout off the usual rubbish--\"BC never hurts, you're too young, blah blah\". It's crap. I was 38 at diagnosis with a fairly large tumor that had probably been growing since I was 30, and the damn thing hurt. Anyhow, that probably didn't make you feel any better--sorry!!! I just want to point out that you are right to want to know what is going on in your breast--you know your body and when something isn't right, and there are never any absolutes with bc, so medical professionals shouldn't act like there are.. As far as MRI's and accuracy--you're more likely to get a false positive than a false negative. If you indeed do have ILC, I feel pretty confident that it would show up in all its glory on MRI.  ",

A 10cm tumor is actually Stage IIIA. You can check the Symptoms and Diagnosis section of this site for staging info or google breast cancer staging to read up on that. No nodes is a good thing, though. Get a copy of her pathlogy report and find out if she has lobular or ductal breast cancer. Lobular bc (ILC) tends to grow very large like that without being very aggressive. It's also usually hormone positive, HER2 negative, which is a less aggressive tumor than say a triple negative ductal (IDC) or a HER2 positive ductal tumor. The most important thing you can do for the both of you is educate yourself about her disease. Knowledge is power in these situations. Good luck to both of you, and you'll get a wealth of info from this site and the people who post here. ",

The rule of thumb is pain that lasts more than two weeks should be investigated. That being said, if you felt a new mass of some sort, you should have it checked out. You say you're young--if you are in your 20's or early 30's, the odds are very good of a mass being a benign cyst, a benign fibroademona or fibrous tissue. The pain could be a strained muscle or some sort of nerve issue. My advise would be to make an appointment with your OB/GYN and have things checked out to put your mind at ease.",

Hopefully someone else will chime in here on that. But both my original biopsy path report and surgical path listed HER2 status as pending and I got that info at a later date. ILC is almost always HER2 negative. Of course, the operative word here is almost.   You might want to ask the onc about trying hormonal therapy before chemo. It seems the trend with mets, especially lobular, is to try the HT first before going to chemo. Some women get good mileage out of that approach. Maybe it's different with abdominal mets, but it would be worth a discussion. There is a lobular board here and also a mets board that you might want to post on. How did they find your abdominal mass? Were you having symptoms? I'd be curious, as I have ILC also. ",

What matters at this point is what the receptors on your mets are, and it's good news that they're ER+. Having had breast and ovarian primaries, there's a good chance you're a BRCA gene carrier. Have you been tested? It's not much of an issue for you personally at this point, but it would be an issue for any children you may have. ",

First off, I'm surprised the onc is recommending neoadjuvant chemo for a 2.6 cm tumor, even if you have multifocal tumors. I had a 2.7 cm tumor in a smallish breast. It took a quadrectomy to get it out, but it's out. The problem with neoadjuvant chemo is that it's hard to stage the cancer correctly b/c you'll never know if your nodes were clear from the start or not. What's FDC? I'm familiar with FEC, but not FDC. 24 weeks does seem like a lot. Most people do 4 to 6 rounds, every 3 weeks, which would be 12-18 weeks of chemo. Since your tumor is low grade, it may not respond as well to chemo as a high grade tumor. If I were you, I'd go for the mastectomy/sentinel node biopsy first, and if the nodes are negative, have Oncotype DX run on the tumor and go from there. You can read about Oncotype on their website, at www.oncotypedx.com. It gives you a recurrence score that also indicates whether your tumor should respond better to hormone therapy or to chemo. There are a lot of chemo combos out there.  Chemo \"light\" is CMF. Many oncs seem to be trending towards TCx4 or 6 based on new data out of the San Antonio Symposium last year ",

Let me see if I can address some of your questions and give you some input. As far as 2 primaries at one time, I don't think that will have as much of an impact on distant spread as the specific biology of each tumor and if you have positive lymph nodes. What are your ER/PR HER receptors on each tumor? They're both pretty hefty size--I would agree bilat mast are the way to go, especially if that's what makes you the most comfortable. I don't know how rare it is to present with 2 primaries in each breast--definately ask the surgeon on Monday about that. As far as the ooph goes, I'd given that a lot of thought when I was waiting on my BRCA testing. I'd decided that if I was positive, I was going to talk to a gynocological oncologist before proceeding, and if I did decide to have ovaries out (I'm only 39, so it wasn't an easy decision to go into surgical menopause), that I would have the gyn onc take them out, not the breast surgeon. My bs had wanted to do my ooph at the same time as my lumpectomy/SNB when we were talking down those lines, and at the time I felt like that was rushing the ooph. I'm not real educated on the benefits of a hysterectomy along with the ooph. I don't know if it adds any benefit, as I don't think BRCA increased one's risk of uterine cancer. But I'm not 100% sure--something else a gynocological onc and a genetic counselor could help you with.  I'm sorry your kids' dad has dropped out of the picture. This is hard enough while married much less on one's own.   Hang in there--the waiting part bites. Good luck at Monday's appointment, and keep us posted.  ",

That's a lot for one family to take.  Since you're HER2 positive, you'll be on Herceptin, which has made the HER2 part of the equation less of a problem than it was in the past. Yes, HER2 tumors are more aggressive, but with Herceptin available to all HER2 women (for awhile it was only for Stage IV), things have changed. The other good news is that although your tumor is grade 3, which is aggressive, that also means that the tumor should respond well to chemo. The negative nodes are also good. Check out the HER2 section of these boards. And another great site to visit is www.her2support.org. Tons of info over there for HER2 + women. ",

My late Stage IV mom was HER2 +, so I spent five years on that board, and I know what you're talking about. However, a lot of those women were not able to receive Herceptin until they became Stage IV (that was the case for my mom). With the advent of Herceptin being available to all HER2 women, I really think that will make a difference in recurrence risk for a lot of early stage women. BC is such an unpredictable disease that it's really impossible to say one person will do well and another won't based on prognostic factors. I will never forget what my mom's onc once said, which was that many times in her career, women whom she thought would do poorly fared well, and women she thought would be fine didn't do so great.  I've read of some women's oncs now telling them, \"Oh, it's too bad you're not HER2 +, b/c we can't give you Herceptin.\" That's how powerful it can be. ",

Others are like my mom, who always had to be on chemo with the Herceptin (and later Tykerb), and ultimately just ran out of options. I personally know two HER2 women with liver mets who have lived for many years (one of them, 11 years) on Herceptin alone. So, I'd focus on the negative nodes (although I realize that's not a 100% guarantee) and be aggressive with the treatment (which you're doing by taking chemo and Herceptin) and go from there. I know women with HER2 -, grade 1 tumors who have mets, so there's no guarantees with this disease. ",

I was told by my surgeon, and have subsequently read in several places, that radiation has no effect on LCIS. I can't imagine why your onc would recommend a mast when what you need is a biopsy. I found my ILC on self-exam. I just had a suspicious finding on MRI, had it biopsied, and got the result today that it is benign--apocrine metaplasia is what the term was, which means fibrocystic changes.  I actually found a small hard lump that felt just like my ILC did in the spot that they ended up biopsying, so I was surprised that fibrocystic changes could feel so malignant-like. Have you had a breast MRI done? The care you're currently getting seems a little unfocused. It seems to me that you need a breast MRI, then biopsies of any suspicious enhancements that might show on MRI. If the MRI is clean, you should be able to feel pretty confident that you just have fibrocystic changes going on. ",

I somehow managed to get through my chemo and still get them to school and activities. Plus my mom is Stage IV bc, and I'm her primary caregiver. I'm doing daily radiation now. Somehow we all manage. But I understand your fears for your children. Try to reserve as much judgment about the situation as you can until you know for sure what's what--that is much easier said than done, I realize. Now, to answer your questions--the u/s is painless--it's like the u/s they do when you're pregnant, just on your boob instead. They can't tell if a mass is malignant from the u/s--just if it's solid or a cyst. Have you had a mammo before? They'll probably do a diagnostic mammo, which involves more views and more boob squishing, but I personally didn't find it painful.  If it's a cyst, they'll try to drain it. If it's solid, they'll biopsy it, probably by core needle biopsy (that's more accurate than fine needle, b/c it takes more tissue). They'll numb the area and take several tissue samples. You'll have an ice pack for the day, and your breast will be a bit sore and bruised, but it's really not a big deal. You'll be OK. Keep us posted, and we're all here to support you. ",

I don't want to take gabapentin, and I think it's all mechanical anyhow. I self-referred to PT (PS didn't think I needed it), and PT found that my diaphragm, which is normally tight to begin with, is in spasm. Also, ribs and vertebrae are not moving properly. She has been doing release work on that and also some myofascia release. After four sessions over a few weeks, I am down to a 4/5 in the mornings, then things get worse as the day progresses. She said my back is tight on the surgery side from the neck all the way down to the top of the hip. I had to ask for Flexiril right after the surgery, and it didn't help anyhow. Heating pads don't help. Ice doesn't help. Stretching makes things worse. So far the only relief comes from the PT manipulating things, but it is short lived. I've also been going for massages, but they don't do much. Has anyone experienced anything like this? For reference, I am a competitive athlete and on the thinner side of things. No meat on my back, so I'm sure most of this tightness is from losing a big hunk of flesh off of my back, combined with surgical incision tightness, plus getting manhandled during the surgery (I had a bruise the shape of a handprint on my back after surgery, pretty much right where most of my problems have been.).

Final sugery path will have all your receptor info on it, as well as final size and grade of the tumor. Definately see the onc before scheduling surgery, although the surgeon should also have an opinion on neoadjuvant chemo. Just as an aside, I had a 2.7 cm tumor is a B cup boob, and was able to have a lumpectomy. It was more of a quadrectomy, and my boob doesn't look like it used to, but it's not too bad really. The surgeon I saw was a combo breast/plastic surgeon, so she was one-stop shopping. If the surgeon you're seeing doesn't do reconstruction, then yes, he should refer you to a PS. There should be one he works with regularly, as he and the PS will have to coordinate the reconstruction. Good luck with the appointment tomorrow!",

They most likely will do a Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) to check her nodes. She will be staged after surgery, unless something were to show up on presurgery scans. Either her surgeon or her oncologist should order a baseline bone scan and chest/abdominal CT for her before surgery. Any stage of cancer can spread to other organs--the biology of the tumor (grade, oncotype score, receptor status) is more important than the size of the tumor. Yes, the waiting sucks.

The flap doesn't help the situation either, since it's muscle. I'm sure some of my issues are nerve related, but I refuse to take Gabapentin. I tried it for a week and felt so loopy it was ridiculous. I tried Percocet, and that did nothing. Muscle relaxants were useless. However, I just had a colonoscopy done today and the IV Fentanyl actually helped quite a bit. But one can obviously not live one's life on IV Fentanyl. Anyhow, I'm hopeful that moving the implant might help. I've heard of women removing their implants and not getting any relief, so who knows. I guess it will be one of those things that is impossible to gauge until it's done. ",

You can read more on bc staging here (sorry I can't post live links with my browser): http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/staging2.asp In the case of the tumor coming through the skin, there is no option for a lumpectomy, which is why the doctor is recommending a mastectomy. He probably feels that there will be positive lymph nodes based on tumor size, which may be why he's suggesting an axillary dissection rather than a sentinel node biopsy. Most women have staging scans done prior to surgery to check for distant metastises. In my case, I saw an oncologist prior to surgery, and the oncologist ordered the staging scans for me (bone scan, chest/pelvic CT). The pathology of your MIL's tumor will be important. You will find out her ER/PR status (positive or negative for estrogen and progestrone expression), her HER2 status (whether her tumor overexpresses the HER2 protein) and the tumor grade. All these things will drive the adjuvant treatment decisions. If she's ER/PR positive, she can take an aromatase inhibitor such as Femara or Arimidex, and if she's HER2 positive, she can have Herceptin along with her chemo. Low grade tumors sometimes respond better to hormone therapy than to chemo. I don't have a lot of experience with treatment for older bc patients, but I would guess they'll probably recommend chemo for your MIL b/c of the tumor size and skin involvement. The chemo risks have to be weighed against the benefits, however. The oncologist will give you guidance on this. Good luck to both of you, and keep us posted on how she's doing. ",

The first time I had an MRI on my neck, I was literally shaking, I was so scared. But I just closed my eyes and psyched myself up, and it was OK. There is light in the machine and they blow air in your face, and it's really not that bad. And again, the breast MRI is different b/c you can see out the other end. And if you keep your eyes closed, you can pretend you're sunbathing on the beach on your stomach. The MRI machine is very noisy in a weird industrial techno beat sort of way. They give you earplugs (for my very long back MRI I had headphones with music), and I just pretend that I'm at a dance club, b/c that's what it reminds me of. So, basically, my experiences have been that thinking about the MRI was actually much worse than doing the MRI. You'll be fine. If the meds make you sick, skip them. I've been fine w/o them myself.

You can read more about the grading system here: http://ccm.ucdavis.edu/bcancercd/311/grading_diagram.html So, the bad news is that it's aggressive. The good news is that aggressive tumors respond better to chemo than low grade tumors.  IDC just means that the cancer originated in the ducts of the breast. IDC accounts for about 85% of breast cancers. \"Angiolymphatic invasion--absent\" means that the pathologist didn't see evidence that the cancer has invaded blood vessels or lymph vessels. That's good. \"Associated DCIS--absent\" means that there's no in situ tumor along with the invasive tumor (in situ means non-invasive).  I don't think that's good or bad--it just \"is\".  There's still a lot of information about your cancer that you don't have yet that will make a big difference in your prognosis and treatment options. When you get your surgical pathology report, you will know the following: receptor status (ER/PR and HER2), lymph node status (whether any nodes under your arm on the affected side had cancer in them), tumor size and final staging (Stage I, II or III). Stage IV (metastisized cancer) would be found on staging scans done before chemo starts.  ER=estrogen, PR=progestorone: If you are positive for ER/PR, you have a hormone responsive tumor that can be treated with either Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, depending on your menopausal status. HER2 is a protein that is sometimes overexpressed in certain cancers and can make that tumor more aggressive. However, if you are HER2 positive, there are two targeted therapies that you can have--Herceptin (for Stages I through IV) and Tykerb (currently only for Stage IV).  Hope that helps a bit.

I haven't heard of having a scheduled break. I didn't have one. Maybe someone else will know about this. The no-bra thing sort of stinks. I'm tiny on top, and it bugs me. I did have one of the other rad oncs tell me that she disagrees with my rad onc regarding the bra issue. She thinks it's OK to wear a sports bra, b/c her theory is that without a bra, your skin will be rubbing against itself, which sort of defeats the purpose of not wearing a bra to protect your skin. So maybe you could get a very soft sports bra and wear it to work, then go braless at home? Sort of a happy medium between the two approaches?

However, in very, very rare cases, girls your age can get breast cancer, so your lump needs to be checked out by a physician. You asked how long bc is present before it's more obvious it's a problem--it totally depends on the tumor, because some grow faster than others, and also there are subtypes that don't present as lumps at first. So it's impossible to say how long a lump has to be there before you have to worry about it. No one can diagnose bc through physical exam or imaging alone--biopsy is the only sure way to tell, and for that you need a doctor.  Do you have a family doctor or OB/GYN you can go see?

I have ILC (invasive lobular which usually presents as a thickening), and quite honestly, I never noticed my thickening. Nor did the numerous doctors over the years who did my clinical breast exams, who completely missed my bc. It wasn't until I felt a rock hard lump myself that my cancer was found. Then when my oncologist finally did an breast exam, she pointed out the thickening, but I still really couldn't notice that much of a difference in the tissue. I know there are other women who had more obvious thickenings who ended up with ILC, but for every one of them, there have been ten others who have had suspicious thickenings that turned out to be fibrocystic changes.  I don't want to downplay your fears, because I've been there and totally understand. And unfortunately, young women your age (and younger) do get bc. And as far as odds go, I ended up with a subtype of bc that accounts for .5% of all bc. At age 38. So, I don't like to give platitudes that \"oh, everything will be fine\", because it's impossible for anyone (including docs who examine you) to definatively state that without a biopsy. HOWEVER, try not to panic (I know it's hard). The waiting part is the worst. And being pregnant on top of it is hard, too. I know I was very emotional during my pregnancies. But I read your other posts, and it sounds like your docs are totally on top of things.  We're here to support you and hold your hand through this. <<<<hugs>>>> ",

Some do it from fear of cancer on the \"good\" side, some do it so the recon will be symmetrical. Basically, the decision is up to her. Depends what she's comfortable with. Sounds like she's decided just the one side if the surgery is Tuesday, though. If she has a sentinel node biopsy done, sometimes the surgeon will send the nodes to pathology while she's on the table, so then the surgeon can do the axillary dissection then and there if the SNB is positive. Other women have to go in for the axillary dissection at a later date after they've had the SNB if the nodes are positive. It depends how the surgeon does things. If the nodes are positive, then most oncs will recommend chemo. If they are negative, the chemo will depend on other factors. These factors include tumor size, tumor grade and receptor status (ER/PR/HER2).  This information will be on her surgical pathology report. If her specific factors land her in a gray area for chemo, then there is a test called Oncotype Dx that can be done if her nodes are negative and she's Stage I or II. The test gives a score which predicts recurrence risk based on the specific DNA of her tumor. Most women seem to land in the gray area on that test, so it's not always helpful, but it is worth doing. There is also an online tool called Adjuvant Online that both you and the onc can use to plug her numbers into. That program will give a percentage benefit of doing chemo, hormone therapy and chemo/hormone therapy together. It's available at www.adjuvantonline.com. Hope that helps a little bit. Keep coming back here for info, and encourage your mom to post, too, if she'd like.  It's a great group of women, and you'll learn everything you ever needed to know about bc as well as get tremendous support. Good luck to your mom (and you!) on Tuesday.   ",

CEA is tested in blood. The normal range is <2.5 ng/ml in an adult non-smoker and <5.0 ng/ml in a smoker. The CEA was one of the first oncofetal antigens to be described and exploited clinically. It is a complex glycoprotein of molecular weight 20,000, that is associated with the plasma membrane of tumor cells, from wich it may be released into the blood. Although CEA was first indentified in colon cancer, an abnormal CEA blood level is specific neither for colon cancer nor for malignancy in general. Elevated CEA levels are found in a variety of cancers other than colonic, including pancreatic, gastric, lung, and breast. It is also detected in benign conditions including cirrhosis, inflamatory bowel disease, chronic lung disease, and pancreatitis. The CEA was found to be elevated in up to 19 percent of smokers and in 3 percent of a healthy control population. Thus, the test for CEA cannot substitute for a pathological diagnosis. As a screening test, the CEA is also inadequate. Since cancer prevalence in a healthy population is low, an elevated CEA has an unacceptably low positive predictive value, with excess false positives. Also, since elevated CEA occurs in the advanced stage of incurable cancer but is low in the early, curable disease, the likelihood of a positive result affecting a patient's survival is diminished. The CEA has been sugested as having prognostic value for patients with colon cancer. Preoperative CEA values have been positively correlated with stage and negatively correlated with disease free survival. Although not satisfactory for screening a healthy population, CEA has been used to monitor recurrence. Early data suggested that CEA prededed clinical relapse by several months. Subsequently, several investigators have examined intensive, serial CEA monitoring as an indicator for second look surgery in the hope that relapse could be detected at a time when surgical ressection for cure was still possible. Criteria for reoperation included a significant rise of CEA above a base line level on serial determinations and absence of obvious unresectable disease on staging workup. Determinations of CEA should be done frequently: at a minimum of every 3 months and if possible every 1 month to 2 months. Elevations above baseline should be verified rapidly to exclude laboratory error. The CEA is of some use as a monitor in treatment. Usually the CEA returns to normal within 1 to 2 months of surgery, but if it returns elevated persistent disease may be indicated. The test is not infallible in patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy but can be useful in those whose tumor is not measurable. The CEA is often positive in malignancies other than colonic. In cancer of the breast, lung, pancreas, stomach, and ovary the CEA may be elevated and can be used to monitor the progress of disease or response to treatement. IMHO, it is highly unlikely that you'd have an elevated CEA from malignant microcalifications, although nothing is impossible. Also, give your step-daughter a big slap up-side the head from all of us here at bc.org for the \"it's probably due to breast cancer, so don't worry\" comment. What's that about?!? At any rate, it sounds like you're getting very good care. It makes sense to rule out colon cancer. Good luck with the breast biopsy, and keep us posted on what happens with that.  Hope that helps a little.",

That sounds a lot like what you're describing in your post. Cancerous lymph nodes tend to be hard and immobile, just like cancerous lumps. I think it was irresponsible for the nurse to scare you like that. As far as the thickening goes, there have been a lot of women who have come here with thickenings that have turned out to be nothing. On the flip side of that, a thickening can be ILC, which doesn't tend to show up on mammo well. You'd need the guidance of a breast surgeon and an MRI to rule ILC out. Good luck on Tuesday!

That being said, follow your gut. Better to push for every test in the world and come out with a benign result and peace of mind. A breast surgeon will be able to tell a lot just by feel. You're wise to go that route. My ILC showed up on mammo a year before it was diagnosed, but the mammo (which was my first baseline at age 37) was read as normal. My mom has Stage IV bc, which is why I had the mammo done before age 40. I'd had clinical breast exams every year with my pap, and no doc ever noticed any thickening. I didn't either. I'd been doing a lot of BSE on the \"bad\" side over the past year b/c I'd been having pain over a rib there. It turned out part of the tumor was growing into the pectorali muscle. At any rate, I never felt a lump or thickening, until suddenly one day in the shower, standing up, I decided to do a BSE and my hand went straight to a very obvious lump. It was rock hard and immobile, and I knew right away what it was. On top of this, I'd been feeling extremely tired and just \"not right\", the past year. I knew something was wrong, and was actually relieved to be diagnosed. I had to fight with my OB/GYN office to be seen. They actually had the nerve to tell me it would be six weeks before someone could check out the lump. I pitched a fit, and they called in an u/s w/o seeing me in person. They actually should've called in a diagnostic mammo, but since they were pretty much incompentent at that office, they didn't. It didn't really matter, though, b/c the lump showed up on u/s, and led to a biopsy. Even I could see on the u/s that the lump was malignant--it had that \"angry\" look that cancer has. After the core biopsy came back positive, I saw the oncologist, who ordered the breast MRI. Then I saw the breast surgeon after that. The MRI showed the tumor at 4.8 cm and the onoclogist wanted me to do chemo before surgery. Then the surgeon walked in, prodded around, and declared the ILC at 2.5 cm, with the rest of the thickening as LCIS. And you know what? She as almost dead on--the ILC portion turned out to be 2.7 cm, and the rest LCIS. So that's why I say a good surgeon should be able to tell by feel what's going on.  I ended up doing chemo after surgery per her recommendation.  Let us know what results you find out on Monday. Glad you're proactive--one really has to be. Hang in there through the weekend--I know how nerve wracking this can be! ",

Even then, you need to go into the bilat mast decision knowing that a bilat mast reduces the risk of local recurrence/new primary by 95%, not 100%. Some oncs (Dr. Susan Love being one of them) even argue that if the cancer is so aggressive that it recurs locally, it is preferable to give the cancer some breast tissue to recur in, b/c otherwise it may end up in your chest wall instead and be harder to treat. As far as the subject of distant mets, a small grade 1 tumor is unlikely to spread to the organs, and if you are more comfortable with a bilat mast than with a lumpectomy, then that surgery is the right decision for you. I'd also recommend, however, thoroughly researching the reconstructive surgery options, so you know exactly what you're getting into.

Now, they did leave the handicap spaces open, but that means the rest of the patients have to park in the south forty of the parking lot, which happens to slope downwards, which means everyone has to trudge uphill and up flights of stairs in order to get to the building.  They really, really did not put any thought whatsover into any of this.

So that makes my last treatment next Tuesday, except they're not sure that I can just have one treatment after a three day break. So I may have to have one more boost than originally scheduled. How annoying. I'm glad that I'm almost done, especially since the office is down from two machines to one machine while they replace the other one. Today, I discovered that they're double booking everyone. I arrived for my 7:30 am appointment and sat there for 15 minutes waiting, since the \"other\" 7:30 am appointment had beaten me there and was taken first. This makes no sense, but then neither did not having docs available in the early morning to see patients last week or blocking off all the patient parking spaces so they could put a dumpster in front of the office.  I am especially stressed right now b/c my Stage IV bc mother, who has been fighting this crap for 5 1/2 years, is starting hospice today. She has been declining over the past few months, and her decline has accelerated this past week. We're probably looking at a matter of days left.

It doesn't describe the tightness in the back and side like I have, but it does say that PT is the way to go (which I'd already been figuring out), and that there are drs who specialize in this called \"physiatrists\". They are is a rehab specialists, and at the medical center I go to, they are in the orthopedic surgery dept. I'd already been thinking I needed an orthopedist. https://www.mskcc.org/blog/coping-pain-after-breas... I have an appt with pain clinic tomorrow, and one of the physiatrists is on staff there.

I was not a good candidate for this surgery, and really wish my PS had been more upfront about all the possible complications. Anyhow, the physiatrist I found is also an osteopath, and the manipulations he is doing are helping a bit, at least in my back. He got my back down to about a 3 after the first visit, during which he got my scapula unstuck. The second visit I didn't notice much difference. During the third visit, which was yesterday, he made some major adjustments in the axillary area that really loosened up my shoulder, but made my back/side/front worse again. I am hoping things will settle down, b/c after the first visit, I was thinking things were sort of to a point where I could tolerate them. My PT does myofascia release--I can't tell if it's helped or not. Overall I can move better and the tissue and muscles \"feel\" looser to the PT and physiatrist/osteopath. But there is still all the pressure/pulling/bra feeling. But it is less intense than it was. I also started using a compounded cream of gabapentin, flexiril and two anti-inflammatory meds. The swelling in my back is much better--not sure if it's from the cream or from body parts getting unstuck or just from time. Feel free to PM me any time.

The exchange is supposed to be for a bigger implant. I can't even begin to imagine a bigger implant in there, aggravating my pec even more.

I've been told my skin looks really good, though, so I guess I shouldn't complain. I will complain, however, about the situation at the rad center today. They usually have two machines--however, starting this week, they are down to one b/c they are replacing the other one. So all patients are being treated on one machine for the next few months, and we all had to get new time slots. So I agreed to the 7:30 am slot. We're also supposed to see the onc once a week. Which is fine. So, they're starting patients for treatment at 7 am, and the oncs are arriving for work at....8:15 am. Hmmm. What's wrong with this picture? So yesterday I just bailed b/c they couldn't even tell me what time the doc might possibly arrive, and I had to be somewhere. Today they insisted I stay and be seen, so I sat there uselessly for 45 minutes until a doctor appeared.  Then, to top it off, he had the wrong chart. It wasn't my regular rad onc--the regular one is out of town--but still. So we had this 5 minute disagreement about how many tx I had left--he obviously had the wrong number, since he wasn't looking at my info. Finally I said, \"Look, you must have the wrong chart, b/c I certainly know when I started, how many tx I've had, and how many I have left.\" Sheesh. He was embarrassed. I also pointed out that if they insist on patients coming in at the crack of dawn for treatment and then being seen by the rad onc, they might want to consider actually having a rad onc available. He assured me that next week there would be someone there. We'll see. Harumph! ",

But I thought there was a hormone test that can be done to tell if the menopause is truly menopause or not. Is anyone having that hormone test done? Seems like it'd be important, since it would also drive the tamoxifen vs. AI issue. Also was told that tamoxifen shuts the ovaries down, and that there should be no periods while on it.

The bilateral pain and heaviness sound hormone related, especially in someone your age. Also, your periods seem to be very sporadic and irregular, which could contribute to the hormonal changes in your breasts. Cancer in a girl your age is not impossible, but it is very, very rare. I'm glad that your doctor is taking you seriously and sending you to a breast clinic, though. Good luck, and just keep in mind that the odds of all of this being nothing are in your favor.",

Just curious if you had your muscle moved or not. But yes, it's all connective tissue issues, as far as I can tell. My PS likes to blame things on nerve damage, which may partially be the case, but I had a parathorasic nerve block before my revision surgery recently, and it didn't do anything to take away the tightness and pulling I have in my side, front and back. I've tried everything you've mentioned to no avail. The only other things I'd suggest to you are Trigger Point Injections, MFR and Graston for scar tissue. I started the TPIs through Pain Clinic recently, and they do help a bit. The Graston helped break down the scar on my back. For MFR, I have had some degree of success with therapeutic endermologie and acupuncture/cupping. Also I've just started soft tissue therapy (similar to the ART technique) with a chiropractor who has experience with lat flap mishaps. He's kind of my last hope, so fingers crossed.

My input to all of this is that one needs to determine if one's post-mx/reconstruction issues are neurological or muscular/skeletal. My PS was very quick to diagnosis PMPS and suggest Gabapentin as the ultimate cure-all, but I'm not so sure. Since waking up from uni-mx and lat-flap recontruction, I feel like I'm being crushed to death in a vice 24/7. The ultimate iron bra/iron corset. I'm pretty sure my issues post-mx/post-lat flap reconstruction are muscular/skeletal. My PS said everything was neurological and my brain just needed to get used to it, and that a little Gabapentin would help. Gabapentin did nothing for me. I suffered through 8 months of PT and an outside physiatrist w/o much success except for getting my back spasms and stuck scapula under control. I fired my PT group and my physiatrist after they both suggested I needed psychological help for my post-mx tightness and pain, when we were not making any more progress. I just started with a new chiropractor who has devised her own post-mx protocol after treating current clients who developed bc. She quickly determined there was no protocol for post-mx PT/treatment, and has tried to come up with her own. I have no idea if any of this would help with purely neurological issues. But she has a protocol that involves a machine that sucks up one's fascia (similar to a PhysioTouch machine, but a different name), Graston Technque (for scar release), general chiropractic adjustment, ultrasound and TENS machines. i just started today, so we'll see. At least there is someone who has a clinical interest in post-mx tightness. She also mentioned a PT on the East Coast with a clinical interest in post-mx tightness and pain. His website is; http://www.nephysical.com/conditions-we-treat/     ",

Despite the fact that my PS keeps insisting I have PMPS, I know I have PMRS, b/c my issues are muscle/fascia/soft tissue related (edema, spasms, restricted fascia), not nerve related. It's an important distinction, b/c the issues need to be handled differently. I had lat flap reconstruction with an implant. In the beginning, it felt like my torso was being crushed in a vice. I couldn't breathe. Now, 16 months and a lot of rehab later, it feels like I have a rock duct taped to my chest, with the duct tape running around my side and across my upper back. If I lay on my non-surgery side, I feel perfectly fine. As soon as I get up and gravity kicks in, then I feel everything. There is no way that can be nerve damage IMO. I had my opinion confirmed by a 2nd opinion surgeon. I was supposed to have a pocket revision 3 months post-op, but wasn't about to let anyone with a scalpel near me at that point. Now I'm willing to have the revision done in hopes it will loosen things up a bit. I'll be having that done next month at the 17 month mark. peyton--I am also astounded that the surgeons don't have protocol in place to address post-reconstruction issues. My PS keeps insisting my problems are from the mx, not the reconstruction, and that it's all nerve damage. I knew she was wrong from the start, and had to seek out my own rehab protocol. While I don't feel terrific, at least I can breathe now, and my movement isn't as restricted as it was. I shared my rehab protocol with the PS's office, and now they are actually referring patients to my rehab people.  ",

I would try that, and if the antibiotics don't help and your symptoms don't resolve or even worsen, then I'd go to somewhere with an IBC clinic. One can have a serious infection w/o fever or malaise. I walked around with a peritonsillar abscess for a month a couple of years ago, which took forever to get diagnosed precisely b/c I didn't have fever and malaise.  Just really narly pain. Two docs totally misdiagnosed it, and it wasn't until I ended up in ER with my throat closing up that it got diagnosed. So my point is that with your breast, either it will resolve or it will get worse, and in the absence of anything on the breast imaging, I think the infection route is the one to pursue right now. The only other imaging that might be worth pushing for would be a breast MRI.  Good luck, and keep us posted! ",

It wasn't until my ILC clumped up and presented as a hard lump that I could feel it. That being said, the odds are against you having lobular bc. However, ILC is very, very hard to see on mammo, and only sometimes shows up on u/s. So my advice would be to press for a breast MRI if the other imaging tests are negative, just to cover all your bases. I had pain with my ILC, but that was because the tumor was growing into the pectoralis muscle. The odds of your pain being fibrocystic in nature (as well as the thickening) are very good.

I did a little research, though, and one of the qualifications for Stage IIIA breast cancer is \"no evidence of primary tumor, but metastases to fixed ipsilateral nodes.\" I don't know where the ipsilateral nodes are, but I think they might be different than the axillary nodes. So, basically, I wonder if it is possible for there to be cancer in the axillary nodes under your arm without evidence of a primary tumor in the breast. Or maybe they just haven't found the tumor in your breast. Do the docs have any thoughts on this? So, just throwing some scenarios out there--hopefully you've just got reactive lymph nodes that are benign. I don't mean to sound like you've got bc for sure. A port sounds like a good idea for you. You're right--any time lymph nodes are taken out of the axillary area, you shouldn't have bp or needle sticks on that arm. Good luck on the 14th, and keep us posted on what's going on. ",
