BUT I have developed fluid under the scar and around my back - kind of behind the armpit.  I can actually move from side to side and see, like a balloon, the fluid moving!  Tomorrow I am being fitted w/ a compression vest. Anyone w/ similar experiences?  Thank you, in advance. PS I also posted this in the Lymphedema forum. Dx 10/8/2008, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "LiveLoveBelieve wrote: Hi all - I hope that each of you reading this is doing well. I had a mastectomy last week - prior to the surgery, I told my boss that I would be right back to work after a week.  The reason is that I was on leave for 6 weeks this summer after breaking my back and getting pneumonia and staying in the hospital - so I felt that I had to get right back to work this time. I am not finding this easy at all - I have alot of pain from \"cording\", and am very tired.  How much time do folks expect for leave?  Doctors recommendations vs. patient recommendations? Thank you, llb - not feeling well after trying to keep a stiff upper lip.... Dx 10/8/2008, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
