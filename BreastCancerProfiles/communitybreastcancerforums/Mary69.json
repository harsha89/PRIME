I am 47 years old. I got a callback on Monday for the first time...to go for an ultrasound on my left breast. The doctor came in after the test and said there was a suspicious abnormality and they recommend a biopsy. I asked her if there is still chance it could be benign..at least 3 times...and she just kept saying...it's \"very suspicious\". It is 1.6cm. I can not feel it at all. She asked the technician if the \"nodes were okay\" and she said yes. My family doctor called me in and couldn't find it on examination either. He said the edges are very \"concerning\". That's the only words they used. I feel diagnosed even before a biopsy. Can they tell for sure before they do a biopsy? My back has been really bothering me also for past two months...not sure if that is related. The biopsy is next week on my son's graduation day. I have two sons with medical needs and I am scared out of my mind. Is there any possibility this could still be benign? Thank you for your help Log in to post a reply",
