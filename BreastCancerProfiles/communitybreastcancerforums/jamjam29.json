I found it very odd that a 3cm mass wouldn't show on an US either until I've read that it happens more then we think! I think I am going to review the results with my doc and maybe request an MRI just to be safe :)  Thanks",

I've noticed there is a section in the forum to help better understand these reports so I think I will be hitting that once I have report in hand and then I will definitely update you all on what's happening :) ",

I had no idea about the significance of my grandfather, thank you! i will be sure to bring him up again! PLJ- I was thinking about an MRI, but is it something I am allowed to just request?? I have a really hard time expressing myself to docs if I don't agree with them, I am getting better given the circumstances, but what if they say no??",

I kind of creeped at first but I think I'm officially a lifer now ;)  I'm 29 yrs old and found a lump a few months ago (well I think it was a few months, my husband was going through cancer for a while so time kinda stopped) and now I just rediscovered it. From what I can tell it has grown in size and that's it. It doesn't hurt or move so I decided to go get checked out by the doctor. After they checked me too, they agreed that they could feel a lump about 3cm in diameter. I was scheduled for an US and it took all of a minute and a half, maybe 2 for the full imaging and consult with the radiologist before the technician came back and told me that I'm too young and it's normal breast tissue, if I was still feeling off about it over the next couple months I could go back. This happened so very quick that I didn't get that piece of mind that I was hoping for and now am left wondering if anyone else has gone thourhg the whole \"you're too young\" thing??

I did mention the family history to my doc and she said they worry if it's a sister or mother, but I did write it down on my questionnaire form anyways. I did call the doc yesterday and I have a follow up appt to go over my US results, so I will request something more. I forgot to mention that when I first had my doc feel the lump she said she couldn't biopsy it because it felt to deep, so should I ask to go to a breast surgeon then?  Thank you again for helping me through this period of my life, I only hope that one day I can be there for you the way you have for me  ",
