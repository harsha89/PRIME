It makes me so sad - I think about it ALL the time. I know I need to just be thankful that I'm here but I can't help it. My wedding is in 2 weeks and I'm a wreck b/c I'm so nervous about how I will look. I actually got a really short haircut last summer b/c I couldn't stand how thin it felt. It's def thinner/weaker. And I used to love my hair :( Any advice/hope anyone can give me? :( Thank you <3 Log in to post a reply",
