Please! My gosh I love all these se!  Thanks Jewels",

Lowrider I am so sorry for the reaccurance.  That really does stink.  The one good thing about no hair is it only takes me 20 mins to get ready. shower to the car.  I love that and I know my husband does too!!  Please keep us posted on your treatment.  Do you know what chemo you will have?  Good luck kicking that cancer butt.  Jewels",
