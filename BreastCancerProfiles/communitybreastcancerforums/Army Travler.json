I am an Army wife, former RN, 39, I have one son who is turning 5 in just as many days.  We just arrived in Japan for my husband's new job after his being deployed for a year.  So, I have no friends or family to talk to about this.  In early April I had severe breast pain with my cycle, which is extremely uncharacteristic for me. We were also packing to move to Japan, so I blew it off a stress induced.  The pain eased off with the end of my cycle but was still present (tender) in areas where lymph nodes are located (center of the breast, just below the clavicle and axillary region nearest the breast (trying not to lose anyone with jargon). If I touched those areas they felt like fire and when I move same thing.  Long story short, I waited to see if after May's cycle if things would resolve on their own.  No such luck.  I've always been a lumpy girl, but no doc has ever said I was fibrocystic or had lumps. Went to the Dr. today, he examined me, what he called CBE (worst exam EVER), said I was fibrocystic, found two lumps, didn't tell me where, said they were smooth, firm, and moveable.  Gave me handout about fibrocystic breasts and a prescription for motrin.  Yeah, motrin.  I asked for a mammogram.  He said I couldn't have one because I wasn't 40 yet. . . that happens in 6 months. I am going back up to the hospital and asking for a mammogram to evaluate new lumps. I am in so much pain right now after his CBE.  My above mid-breast lymph node is throbbing and it's been over 12 hours since, I've taken motrin and zero help. The base we are at is VERY limited in the capabilities.  I am stressing out over the whole ordeal, but am even more stressed as to what this means for my family.  We haven't even made it into quarters (housing on base) and are living out of a hotel. We're due to move in at the beginning of June. . . summer is here, which means no school, the process to get childcare is very convuluted, my husband is in the middle of a very important exercise and can't be with me as much as he would like.  I had to bring my son with me to the appointment this morning.  I am not a whiner.  I am good Army wife, taking things on the chin and roll with the punches but I think I've reached my breaking point.  I am not sure how things are going to go. . .no cancer treatment centers here or breast specialists.   I just wish I had a friendly face to vent to and a shoulder to cry on.  This is the closest thing I have right now as I don't want to be an alarmist until I get things moving in the right direction.  Thanks for letting me vent. I've read some of the posts and know that I can only do 5 messages. Thanks again.  I do feel somewhat better. Log in to post a reply",
