I have a very elevated risk, due to family history. I have diagnostic mammogram & ultrasound every year. The past year (or so) I've experienced discharge from R nipple, ranging from clear to white to blood. Mammogram 10/2016 was all clear. Discharge continued. I had a Mammogram/Ultrasound yesterday and a 6mm mass found in R breast, but Dr recommended repeating the tests in 6 months. Met with the Breast specialist after and i again stated the discharge is getting more often and I am experiencing pain the the R breast. ONLY the R breast. Dr told me to put clear nail polish on my nipple every day to stop the discharge. I am to return to her office in 2 weeks (Nov8). It is the hope that she will be able to \"get some discharge\" to test. Then I will most likely have a ductogram/breast MRI. I guess I am asking if anyone else has been advised by a Dr to put clear nail polish on their nipples. It is a weird feeling and seems wrong. Log in to post a reply",

I called them yesterday and requested a copy of the report. I asked the Dr \"if this were your breast, would you be willing to \"watch\" it for 6 months?\" - she replied Yes. Now I am painting my nipple and hoping for the best.",

The Dr wants the nail polish to clog up the nipple so there is a greater chance of her being able to get discharge. I've put the nail polish on my nipple now for 2 days and each time it feels weird and burns. I am not sure how long I will be able to stand it. I wish the Dr would have said \"you have a NEW 6mm mass in the R breast, now we biopsy\". Not \"lets check it in 6 months.\" I just feel like I am doing a disservice to my nipple with the chemicals. Honestly, I have no idea what I can/should do next. I just want to know why I have ever changing discharge from one nipple, what is that new mass, and why does the breast sting.",
