I was sure I was going to be sick and lose weight. I'm not wanting to but just expected too. My vision was the first thing I noticed changing to the point of actually making me nervous. I wonder if it is permanent? I was wondering if anyone else had a radical drop in platelets after their first A/C? Mine went from 235 to 125. I asked what I could do or take and they said nothing. They told me they are not concerned unless it goes below 100 which seems very close to me. This is my girl Amy. 13 years old with liver cancer but she has proven all of the vets wrong and has lived a year lived a year longer than expected so far.",

It does go away by it self 1 or 2 hours later. I never have headaches so it's odd. I don't however have the neck tension and body aches on a daily basis. I'd say more like 3-4 days every 2 weeks. I hope yours are nothing! Please let us know. Big hugs",

No one informed me about the potential of such bone pain so I would have never known. Like you said they just sort of glossed over bone pain with all of the other side effects. Gosh I hope your CBD or something helps your pain. Sending hugs and prayers your way",

I live in Colorado and can get THC if I need it but was going to try no THC. Just soI can be prepared could you tell me or show me which one you received from CA? Thanks I've kind of worked myself into a tizzy about this and want to be prepared. So glad to hear you are managing this.. Stay strong and big hugs! Wendy",

The dinicap was approved by the FDA last year and I am lucky enough to have 2 places here in Colorado that have them and my insurance approved payment. It's a cap you wear one hour before Chemo, during Chemo and 3 hour after Chemo that preserves 50-80 % of your hair. Downside is it pumps liquid at 2 degrees through it the entire time and I have to stay at Chemo an extra 4 hours. It's very cold, give me head aches, and is extremely tight. After 2 A/C treatments I still have 95% of my hair just don't know if I can make it through 2 more A/C and 12 Taxol. You all seem just fine and I just wondered if anyone else was using it",
