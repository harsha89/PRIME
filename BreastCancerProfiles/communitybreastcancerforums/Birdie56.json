I ordered a couple from www.sammydress.com for about $10 a piece and am amazed at the quality and fit of them. You do have to choose the wig in the only color they show it in and it arrives on a slow boat from China, literally, but with the price and free shipping it was a fun package of 3 wigs to receive! Here's one :) Take care sweet warriors! ",

Before this recent breast cancer diagnosis I worked hard for almost a year and a half to stop coloring my hair and grow out my pretty salt and pepper hair that I have now, I am 59. I'm totally bummed that I'll be losing it in the next month lol! Best wishes Lisa and to all of you ladies.",
