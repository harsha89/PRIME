This time I was informed that there is a new one, 1.3 cm, found in the lymph node. I have been referred to a specialist and my appointment is Dec. 2nd. I have also had a diagnostic mamo done a week ago with no calls regarding these results. November 7th was three years since my mother passed away from breast cancer. I am trying to stay positive in my thinking but her death is still fresh in my memory. Any ideas of how to get through this untilÂ a diagnosis can be made. All suggestions are encouraged.
