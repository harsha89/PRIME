The stress of the wait is almost unbearable. I wake up in the middle of the night and start crying. Xanex helps. Sometimes I feel a dull ache where the lump is located. Has anyone else had this feeling? I realize I might be hypersensitive because of the anxiety caused by the DX and waiting for treatment. I see the PS again on Monday and I'm going to ask her the following:  1) advantages/disadvantages of saline vs. silocone, 2) how skin sparing for nipples works and its advantagres/disadvantages, 3) how long will the implants last, 4) are there circumstances while I'm undergoing surgery that may prevent the PS from doing immediate reconstruction? If anyone has other important questions I should ask the PS, I'd really appreciate your suggetions. I am so grateful that all of you have taken the time to share your experiences.",

Somewhat nervous, About how long do the drains need to stay in? I have 2 drains and report my numbers daily. I also have an On-Q pain pump; has anyone had experience with this? This is all very surreal, but I'm feeling positive.",

I was diagnosed on April 1st (the lump was found by my GYN on March 12 and I had a normal mammogram last July). I was a candidate for a lumpectomy, but have opted for a bi-lateral with immediate reconstruction. I just heard that my surgery date won't be until May 21st. I am terrified about the long wait. I can't get a feel for what increased risks happen during this period.",

I too have had pain all over the radiation site. It has been going on for 2 years. My neck also hurt and perhaps the most bothersome were the daily headaches.My quality of life had really deteriorated and dealing with all the pain was no doubt affecting my short-term memory. I can't tell you how many things I tried, but I recently reviewed the studies and clinical trials about radiation induced fibrosis. There is a Phase 2 clinical trial going on now with people who have radiation indusced fibrosis. The treatment asks subjects to take 400 I.U. of Vitamin E and 3 daily does of a prescription drug for increasing circulation called Pentoxifylline (400 mg). I persuaded my doctor to let me try it.  It has only been a week, but my body is less painful when I touch it and for only the 5th day since this all began, I don't have a heachache!  I'm not sure if this course of action will help, but I would talk with a doctor about it.  keep me posted.",
