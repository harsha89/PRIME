It was very therapeutic to write it though :) After reading more, especially from others who have been exactly where I am, I'm not feeling as completely averse toward a surgical excisional biopsy as I was. It doesn't sound like there's any other conclusive way to ensure there's not something else lurking in the area. And maybe I was jumping to some conclusions a bit too quickly. I haven't even had my first surgical consult and I've only talked to my GP thus far. I'm just feeling frustrated, scared and a bit angry. And from what it sounds like... this is completely normal! I will admit that I'm feeling especially glad that I have an upcoming consult with a outside specialist in breast oncology and surgery. And now that I'm more educated, I feel like I can move forward with a bit more confidence. Thank you all!! I'm beginning to feel a bit less 'alone' and that already has me thinking more positive... a miracle in itself :) Leah... you said it best... I just need to remember to breathe!",

      "Content": "JaniceB2003 wrote: Hello... I'm new here but have been reading a lot of what others have experienced and have been scouring the net for information. I'm a bundle of emotions at this point, but when I stop and center myself, I get this nagging feeling that my doctors want to do procedures that just aren't warranted at this point. They have been very clear that my results are 'NOT CANCER', so why do they want to continue with additional biopsies, etc.? Anyone else feeling like this? My story (it's rather long, but I feel like I need to tell it just to test my sanity)... I'm 42 years old, first ever mammogram on 9/5. No palpable lumps. No breast cancer of concern in my family (2 aunts diagnosed after the age of 80 \u2013 but told that doesn't really count because of their age). Somewhat increased risk because I am overweight and have never had children. The mammogram showed 2 suspicious areas in my left breast and I was asked to come back in for additional images and possibly an ultrasound. Second set of magnified images on 10/1 showed one area with 'fibrous' tissue and one with suspicious calcifications. Radiologists wanted to perform ultrasound immediately (I was prepared for that). Ultrasound showed the one area was likely a fibroadenoma and the other was difficult to see due to the location (and as I later found out, that the calcifications are extremely hard to see on ultrasound anyway), but that it was likely not cancer. It was recommended to do a needle biopsy to confirm both areas were benign. Since I was at a breast center, all the resources were right there, so it was just a matter of going into a different room to talk with the group that does the biopsies. They explained the procedure and it sounded straight forward and seemed to make sense, so I scheduled it for 2 days later. The next day, my Primary doctor called to discuss next steps with me. He told me not to worry because the radiologist believed the areas to be benign, but that the biopsy would confirm. He reminded me that I had the option to refuse the procedure and just monitor the areas with another mammogram in 6 months, but that if I had the biopsy and nothing was found, that I would be able to just go back to normal mammogram screenings. At this time, I was starting to feel a bit anxious, so I figured I should just get the biopsy to put my mind at ease. Day of the biopsy (Friday 10/3)... a different radiologist was assigned to do the procedure than the one who had reviewed the mammograms and ultrasounds before (this one was actually the director of the breast clinic and has 30 years experience \u2013 so that made me feel a little more comfortable). He's the one that explained that the microcalcifications that I have are difficult to see on ultrasound and wondered aloud why I wasn't 'next door' - I had no idea what that meant, it just left me puzzled and nervous. Let's just say, this is the point where I started to doubt what I was going through was a 'typical' cancer screening. The doctor spent a good 15-20 minutes trying to find the area with ultrasound. Eventually he asked if I would feel comfortable with allowing him to place a thin needle into the area he suspected (the one with the calcifications) and then have me go into the mammogram room to get an image to confirm the location. I agreed, but expressed my concerns that the needle might jostle out of position during all the movement to get to the other part of the building. He didn't seem to think the needle position would shift so we proceeded as he suggested. The mammogram showed the needle in the correct position and after being led back into the biopsy room and getting re-situated, he proceeded with the needle biopsies. He left the thin needle in place while he performed the biopsy on the first area - this was easily seen on the ultrasound and took just a few minutes to get 6 or 7 samples with what I can only describe as a spring loaded needle (I wasn't told what it was called, but I could see on the ultrasound image that the head of the needle popped out, grabbed a sample and retreated back in). As he was finishing up, he placed a marker in this area. Then, he changed out equipment and prepared for the other area - the thin marker needle was still in position. This second biopsy needle was thicker and he inserted it at a slightly different angle than the thin needle marker so he could get to the same area and see it clearly on the ultrasound image. This time the needle was not spring loaded, but more like a vacuum. He took (sucked up) a good sized sample and placed a marker here as well before removing the needles. During this whole process he and the technician were debating if they were seeing the calcifications or not. He left the room with the second sample while she bandaged me up. He came back in a few minutes later shaking his head. The technician visibly tensed and went over to him and they finished labeling the samples while I began to final worry. I have to say... I was not feeling good about this interaction and I really had no idea what was going on. Prior to this appointment, I hadn't really done much research on breast cancer or the screening tests. And it dawned on me that I was blindly letting people make decisions for me simply because I wasn't educated. Anyway, I was told pathology would take 2-3 business days to provide results back to my primary doctor so not to expect a call until Tuesday or Wednesday. Over the weekend I started to develop blisters around the edge of one of the Tegaderm bandages. I peeled them back and trimmed them as I didn't want to take off the bandage so soon after the procedure. By the next day though, all the edges were developing blisters so I had to remove them completely. Luckily, I'm not a 'bleeder' so the area didn't start bleeding or oozing, but I did place regular band aids on the punctures. Later, the band aids were also causing blisters so I removed them as well and just placed a tissue in my bra. I called the breast center first thing on Monday morning to ask about the blisters\u2026 apparently I'm allergic to the adhesive so was told to apply cortisone for the itching and aquaphor to help heal the skin. It was pretty miserable and so far, this was the worst part of all that I had been through! The hematoma and subsequent soreness was no picnic, but the rash was awful. I was surprised when my doctor called on Monday afternoon. He told me it was good news, no cancer and no pre-cancerous cells. The first area was a fibroadenoma as suspected and the second was labeled as 'rare calcifications', and that I could go back to normal mammogram screenings. Alleluiah! Well... 2 days later my doctor called again and left a message saying he had received additional information on the pathology report and would like me to call him back. He said it's not bad news so not to panic. We played phone tag for the next 2 weeks. I wasn't too concerned because his messages told me not to be and it certainly didn't seem like he was trying too terribly hard to reach me! When we finally did connect, he told me that the radiologist who had performed the biopsy had called him after he saw the pathology report and explained that he didn't believe he got the right area after all because the mammogram showed a large area of calcifications and that the 'rare calcification' result meant there were very few in the sample. He recommended that I return for a stereotatic biopsy. My doctor said he would leave it up to me\u2026 he said that even though the calcifications were not prevalent in the sample, that all the tissue they did collect was normal. He also added that the radiologist is known for being a perfectionist and would like to satisfy his curiosity to see if the pathology would be different if more calcifications were present. I could tell my doctor was also curious, but he really wanted the decision to be mine. I told him I would talk to my husband and get back to him. After talking through the pros and cons and doing some research (and most importantly, figuring out if we could afford it), my husband and I decided I should get the stereotactic biopsy to put our minds at ease knowing the correct area was being reviewed. I called the doctor back the next day and was eventually scheduled for 10/29 with the same radiologist (I waited 2 extra days so that he could be the one to do the procedure, I figured if he was that curious, and if he truly was a perfectionist, he would want to do it himself). In the meantime, I started doing more research on breast cancer risk factors and the screening tests. Now it made sense to me why the doctor wondered why I wasn't 'next door', the next room over was where they performed the stereotactic biopsies, and that is the best option for biopsies when microcalcifications are hard to read on the ultrasound. Too bad he wasn't the original radiologist that reviewed the mammograms and ultrasounds nearly a month ago! I would have been saved doing 2 separate procedures\u2026 oh well too late now. The stereotactic biopsy, besides being surreal (lying on a hard table with your boob dangling through a hole, squished with a mammogram machine, and with the doctor and technicians below you), was pretty uneventful. The doctor was sure he got all of the calcifications and placed a new marker at the site. This time they used Dermabond instead of the Tegaderm so thankfully no adhesive reactions, but this was a larger puncture and the consequent hematoma was even larger and more sore than before. This time, I waited 3 the business days (plus a weekend) for the pathology report and still no call from my doctor, so I called and left a message for him. That evening I got the call that the results were in and that there was NO CANCER. He repeated that a couple of times, but there were abnormal cells\u2026 atypical ductal hyperplasia. This was not something I remembered from the research I did, but I was glad to hear it wasn't ductal carcinoma in situ, which was my fear based on what I'd read. But the doctor said, while it isn't cancer and isn't necessarily pre-cancer either, that he recommended getting a surgical consult for an excisional biopsy. He went on to explain that some surgeons recommend a lumpectomy and some are even extreme in recommending a mastectomy, so getting 2 opinions was probably a good idea. He also said that with this diagnosis it's not uncommon to treat with radiation and chemoprevention. Now I was scared\u2026 surgery, radiation, chemoprevention?? For something that's NOT CANCER?? I just kind of went numb and agreed to what he said next\u2026 first meet with a surgeon in his medical group and then if I want a 2nd opinion to call him back and he would provide the name of another surgeon. Again, my husband and I talked it through\u2026 I have now met my deductible and have nearly met my out-of-pocket maximum, so financially we should just go for it. This is the point I started to get angry\u2026 it's ridiculous that deciding on medical treatment often comes down to finances (completely a side note, but still prevalent in my decision making process)! So the first surgical consult was scheduled (it's tomorrow) and now I've finally started to let my brain catch up with my emotions\u2026 I don't have cancer, but the doctor is reacting as if it is cancer. What does this mean? Are my risk factors worse than I thought? Is cancer inevitable? If I don't treat it aggressively now, will I always be worried? Every surgery has risks, are those risks I'm willing to take without a cancer diagnosis? I'm overwhelmed! With all these questions and emotions running through me, I decided I might as well schedule the other surgical consult too. Especially since my deductible and out-of-pocket max will reset in less than 2 months. So another phone call to my primary doctor\u2026 this time, I have to say, he almost sounded relieved that I was asking for a referral for a 2nd opinion. I guess because there are surgeons in his medical group, he must feel obligated (or maybe he truly is obligated) to make referrals 'in group' first. And he did say the surgeon is very good, but that his 2nd referral is the best breast oncology surgeon in the area. Luckily, she is 'in-network' for my insurance as well (so no separate deductible and out-of-pocket max) so I went ahead and called her on Friday. Her assistant explained that she insists on reviewing all prior screenings including the pathology slides before making an appointment. She wants to confirm diagnosis before proceeding with any treatment or procedure recommendation and she would call me in a few days to a week to schedule the consult. Wow\u2026 that sure makes sense! So over this past weekend, I've continued exploring my emotions and questions. I've read quite a few accounts of women (on this site and others) who don't care what their true diagnosis is\u2026 they just 'want it out'. And I guess I can understand they want that to provide them peace of mind, but I didn't see anyone out there questioning if they really need to go through all these procedures when there is no conclusive information showing that certain types of cells (ADH) will definitely turn into an invasive cancer that warrants removal and then subsequent radiation and/or chemo treatment? I can't be the only one feeling like these are extreme 'preventative' measures, can I? Even after reading more, I found that DCIS is stage 'zero' cancer\u2026 so not really quite cancer yet either. So since ADH 'might be' a pre-cursor to DCIS, isn't that saying you have cells that might or might not turn into something that might or might not turn into cancer? There are way too many 'might or might nots' in that chain of possibilities to make me want to have even minor surgery (excisional biopsy). Perhaps after the surgical consults I'll understand better why they even recommend it, but for right now, I just feel like it's way too early to be discussing anything invasive. Are there others out there concerned like me that we are rushed into treatment in the name of preventing cancer? Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming. ~Dory, Finding Nemo Log in to post a reply",
