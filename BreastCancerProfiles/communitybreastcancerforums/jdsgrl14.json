    "Content": "jdsgrl14 wrote: Hello, I am 29 years old. I have been experiencing an itchy right breast and nipple for about a year now. Here recently it has gotten to be unbearable. I have seen my DR she referred me out to a general surgeon but he sent me for a diagnostic mammogram. I went expecting a mammo but I got an ultrasound. The DR stated there were no signs of cancer. When I logged in to check my report it said I have \"induction of breast\". From what I can tell and read this has been linked to inflammatory breast cancer. I am losing my mind with the fear. I just don't understand what it all means. I am unsure of where to go next. Any support or advice is much appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
