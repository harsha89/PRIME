Thank you for all your kind, wise words of welcome. My sister's scan is tomorrow. Her trial includes chemo, targeted radiation, and immunology. It's been exhausting, but hope is what we will go with. I tried to update my signature with her history - it mostly worked. If not, I'll put it here in her words.  Diagnosed July 2015, 31 weeks pregnant, felt lump - Stage 2 B Luminal, ER + / PR +, HER equivocal, FISH equivocal, Mammoprint negative - 1 round AC/CT - 2 rounds TC / CT (2nd opinion) Baby (healthy thank god) - 3 rounds TC / CT - Surgery early 12 / 2015 - ER + / PR +, HER 3+, FISH negative, should have been given HER at this point - Radiation -- February until May 2016 -- had a few breaks Remission, or so we think July 2017, felt thickening in neck - Surprise! ER + / PR + / HER +, liver (I think only one spot < 2 cm) / bone mets, small spots in lungs (Stage IV) - Herceptin / Perjeta every three weeks - Jan 2018 - Scan negative, bone stable, no sign of mets Remission, or so we think July 2018, routine scan, progression - tumor 1.4 X 1.5 cm (??) in liver (different spot), spots on lungs, bone seems stable, plot twist -- triple negative Start immunotherapy Tx (QUILT Trial) 9 / 2018 - tumor grew 1.9 x 1.5 cm between July - Sept 3 week cycles, Scan 10/23 (after 3rd cycle) Feel like shit",

I just got back from visiting my sister for her 50th birthday. I wish we didn't live on opposite coasts so I could be there more often. I got to go to the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute for Medicine at Mariposa, which is implementing the trial she is on. While Patrick Soon-Shiong is often described as an eccentric billionaire, the upside of having a billionaire funding the research is that the center is clean, bright, new - and fully staffed with wonderful nurses, a social worker, oncologists, and PA, all of whom devoted significant time to talking to my sister about how she is feeling both physically and mentally. They eventually will have scanning and blood transfusion facilities but not quite yet. I felt relieved she is in such careful and caring hands - but I couldn't help wishing that all of you had access to this standard of care. The oncologist also spent at least 20 minutes answering questions from me and my brother in law and let me know that the official read of her latest scans showed a 14% reduction in her liver tumor. 30% reduction is a full response. 20% growth is progression - and anything in between is considered stable. So stable! Stable is good. Her lung met disappearing is a good thing too (only 2 of 3 remain and they are small). Her next scan is in 2 months. Oh, and it turns out this trial also included SBRT to her largest lesion and she received the max radiation to her larger liver lesion. Question for you - at what point did you talk to your young children about your diagnosis and did you get professional help for them (i.e. a therapist)? My nieces are 7 and 3 and my sister hasn't ever said anything to the older girl. But I know she knows, she's smart and observant and also has the keen ability to overhear things. It is not my decision, but my brother in law wants to tell them and my sister does not. The social worker said she has resources but my sister does not want to even look at them yet... Wishing you all a happy Fall.",

Her latest scan from 2 weeks ago (she gets them every 8 weeks) shows stable mets in liver. Another friend also just found out she has MBC with mets in bone and liver. She is now on xeloda...Hoping your MO will find an appropriate trial or plan for you soon. Joy",

I have mentioned Y90 to her thanks to what you and others have said about it.

I think that was the requirement for enrollment into the trial. Her MO at that time, Dr. Link, had a connection to the center and I think was able to expedite her acceptance into the trial. From what I understand, it is a 3 week protocol - 1 week oral chemo, 2 week IV chemo and hank infusion X2, 3rd week chemo and hank infusion 1X. The trial goes for a year and then maintenance for a year (which will be oral chemo + hank every other week). I'm not sure the exact chemo she is on - it is metronomic chemo and involves blue pills, pink pills, and IV. Her QOL is so-so for her, not dreadful objectively. But then she was always super active so it is all relative. She is not a fan of napping in the afternoon when she could garden, bake, or hang out with her extremely rambunctious children! The nurses say you have to be tough to get through it all and it is true. Anecdotally, her current MO has said that metastatic breast cancer has responded best to this protocol. One of her friends has seen a 3 inch reduction in her 7 inch liver met! I wish that all of you could have such excellent care as she is receiving at the center. The nurses, MO, pharmacist, social worker, and physician's assistant stop by every day she is there to talk to her. And when I am there, they spend time with me too. She feels very fortunate. If you have any other questions, please let me know and I will ask her.",

My sister was originally diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 46. That was 4 years ago while she was pregnant with her second child. She found a lump and although her midwives brushed it off, she went immediately to her doctor and was in chemotherapy two days later. Niece is healthy (and a holy terror) - and after a year, my sister was declared cancer free. About a year after that, she felt her lymph nodes and \"didn't feel right.\" Luckily her doctors took her seriously and she had a scan which showed stage IV cancer with small mets to liver and bone. I don't want to be too specific about her treatments because I don't know them by heart and I don't want to mistype anything. I will confirm them with her and add them to my profile - but please note she needs to be in the right frame of mind to go through them all with me. But the important thing to note is that her cancer has morphed over two years from +/+/- to +/+/+ to now -/-/-. Even though it really stinks to be triple negative, we are grateful that we know so that she can get appropriate treatment. Right now, my sister is enrolled in a small trial, QUILT-2.028. I'm not allowed to post the link but you can look it up. It's a combination of immunology, radiation, chemo and \"vaccines.\" I'm nervous about it since it is funded by a controversial figure (Patrick Shoon-Shiong) - but I have to believe in it for her sake plus her MO has been excellent so far and recommended it to her. She's exhausted and her hair has fallen out and she is scared and overwhelmed with two young daughters and two young kittens (although the kittens are very calming when she is resting after treatment). In the meantime, I wanted to thank you all for your candor and research. I share what I learn here with my sister and she gets a lot of comfort from your stories. If you have any questions about her trial, please let me know and I will pass along the questions to her. You all continue to be in my prayers as you have been for the last 2 years. Oh, and Grannax2 - great shoes!! ",

It was hectic but I managed to get away to spend time with her during treatments at the Soon Shiong cancer center. Thursday was frightening as she had severe rigors for the first time as a reaction to the immunology (high affinity natural killer cells) and she had to have demerol to help control the shaking. But we made it to my niece's play that night so that was a win. I wanted to share some good news. She had a PET scan on Friday. The last two CAT scans have been stable. The PET scan showed that the uptake from her largest lesion (about 1cm X 2cm) is barely higher than the normal tissue. In 2017, uptake was about a 6.5. Now it's 2.5 - 3. Oncologist says normal uptake is between 1 - 2. Head of clinical trial says she is not overly concerned with the liver right now but will be comparing PET scans from 2017 to this latest one to check on some bone... but overall, positive news as the brightest thing on her PET scan was a pimple! The treatment has been brutal and I think my sister's quality of life isn't ideal (she used to run marathons and now is too tired to walk too far) - but we are very happy with the results. I wish you all strength, peace, joy and I pray for you often. Joy",

When my sister had a strange bump in a personal area, her MO took a first look. It was just a pimple but they would have advised her if otherwise. Otherwise, going to the ER seems to make sense so that your records are all in one place. Fingers crossed it is something simple. My sister has officially had a partial response to her clinical trial! So lesions have decreased by 30%. Radiologist says edges are now so diffuse it's hard to measure - her main lesion is now estimated to be 12mm X 15mm. All going in the right direction.",
