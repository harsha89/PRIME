I have to have radiation for 6 weeks Mon-Fri. So far, it has been a pleasant experience. The radiation equipment is brand new and they've had it since 2015. I go into the radiation room with a cotton blouse and no bra and the radiologist accommodates me into a cradle (made to my specifications) opens my blouse and then closes my house, but does not button it for the treatment. What I like is that I can keep my own blouse on (it has to be cotton). Each treatments lasts about 5-8 minutes; however it takes about 1/2 hour from the time you enter until you leave. Everyone is very pleasant. I was given a cream to apple for any burning which has not occurred. The cream they gave me was Calendula First Aid treatment for minor burns and sunburn. I was also told that I could bu Aloe Vera 100% gel. I haven't had any burns and my skin is doing great, but it's only been 5 treatments. I was diagnosed as stage 1- T1b, No Mo - (1cm, luminal b, ki-67 40). The oncologist recommended chemo (because of the ki-67 rate of 40), but I refused. I have to take letrozole and I don't look forward to taking it because of the horrendous side affects, but I have no choice. The radiation therapy is not too bad. I'm just lucky to be here. Good luck with your radiation. Soon all this will be a memory for both of us.",
