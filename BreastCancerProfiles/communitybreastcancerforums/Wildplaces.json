Breath holding techniques offer some protection to your heart. Mepitel - a silicon based film - has helped and I have only a very very minor skin reaction. Apart from fatigue - doable. Sherlandpony is spot on (as usual!!:)) it's not a burn but a skin deficit - the base dermal layer fails to regenerate at the same speed (covering with film means less of the top layer is shed and the bottom layer gets a longer go at getting its act together) - the reaction you get is not related to how fair you are. I too am quite fair skinned ....",

Having said that, you are right - both ALH/LCIS while not being overt cancer by themselves carry a significantly higher risk of cancer at 5-10 years... . I am assuming you had a mass biopsied?? Did you have any/further imaging ?? If it was me - I would take my breasts, films and my biopsy pathology and get it reviewed by a breast surgeon (not a general surgeon, someone who does lots of breasts) - because it needs to be followed up, and how to best do so, depends on a number of patient factors: age, hormonal status, family history, breast size etc. The simple answer would be MRIs but they are not always easy to get. I am about to look up where Bunburrry is ... but you have time to get yourself to a reputable breast surgeon and get a proper explanation and follow up plan. Please do not leave it. I find the \" incidental\" comment on ALH/LCIS a little flippant. I hope I did not worry you - if you posted this you figured out it needs a good pair of eyes 😊🌷 ( I suggested a breast surgeon because they would be the most knowledgeableregarding follow up and biopsy not because I think you need surgery)",

Like Magee Equations or predict.nhs.uk Grade - is taken by some as a measure of \" aggressiveness\" - and the number refers to how fast cells replicate as evidence by shape, nuclei and mitochondria.So yes the cells might be dividing quickly - good thing that is what chemo drugs attack - but other factors such as size, receptor, no nodes is what gives better numbers for recurrence. They are certainly alternatives to Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin) Chemotherapy regimens for second stage breast cancer is classified into \" generations\" 1,2,3 rd. The higher the number the \"tougher\" the drugs - but there is also individual variation in response. Oncs should be able to quote you recurrence rates for a specific chemo regimen - from memory predict.nhs lets you pop that information in. Epirubicin is another anthracycline and some studies claim less cardiac effects. I am 49 and did AC/Taxol and I would do it again if \"I had to\". The Taxol is an easier chemo drug to tolerate bar any allergic reactions to it. On the second opinion - if in doubt ask again and summon the energy :) to keep asking until you are comfortable",

But chemo is doable. You will have some couch days and then some medium function/good days where you can get out, walk, drive, go for a lunch. Walk even for 5 - 10 minutes on your shittiest day and it help. Just get up no matter how you feel - that would be my strongest message I think it much much harder if you have to work. Lots of planning info on various past threads so keep reading. Most centres run a info session. Without going into specific these are the broad areas to stock up on. You will need some meal preplanning/freezing and some home help if possible. Take all offers. Order online if you have to. Herbal teas to hydrate - drink your fav but keep in mind your taste you change over chemo. A list of what medictions to take for what side effects - and familiarise yourself with them now. The list below is used by my centre ( obviously it needs to be individualised and proviso not allergic to anything!!) Most centres will give you antiemetics with your therapy and two days of dexamethasone ( helps with potential drug reactions and the nausea) Zofran - nausea ( can cause constipation) Losec - reflux Imodium - diarrhoea Movichol - constipation Loratidine - itch rash muscle and bone pain Ativan ( lorazepam ) anxiety Worth ascking to be prescribed a mild sleeping tablet - you do not have to take it if you do not need it. If you are needle phobic a cream or patch called EMLA ( local anaesthetic in it) placed 30-45 minutes prior over the area will numb skin. There are others but I would call the above the basic kit. And a few surrounding comforting things for when you are flat - fresh linen, music, and DVDs worked for me. It plays with your smell so perfumed anything does not help. Cheap clean natural creams/oils are best. Biotene, natural yoghurt, baby toothbrush and toothpaste helps with mouth hygiene. Some centres prescribe oral dexamethasone mouth wash but I go with natural Greek yoghurt any day for ulcers. Make a decision about your hair now - multiple options com cold caps, synthetic wigs ( choose your current hairstyle in a wig if that how you'll go), wraps. Find a good pencil that matches your eye browses - you will loose some at some point. Get a lighter colour lipstick - your face will be paler all round. Decide on a couple of comfortable outfits for home and out and keep that smart and simple for this time. Find a class - yoga, reiki etc that you can go once a week so you have a little pocket away from home. You can do this!!😊",

I know how weird that sounds.... Yep, we are both good - thank you - on AI inhibitors. The only reason I did not have a BMX was because I did not want a potential complication with a \"healthy breast\" to delay chemotherapy. I am planning to have my right breast off early in the New Year. I have chosen not to reconstruct but that is again superpersonal, I am close to 50, have an established family, and you know, short of the inconvenience of occasionally having to stuff my bra with socks, I am not too fussed about it. I may change my mind in the future but I am taking it as it comes. I have always liked me just as I rolled along, clumsy, wide eyed, and small breasted - go figure. Having said that I think if I only had DCIS or LCIS and needed a mastectomy, I WOULD have reconstructed. It sounds like you have time to make the right decision for you once you get ALL the information. Do I miss my breast?? - heck yes, do I regret my decision?? - absolutely not. Hoping it is all in situ - and that you can have a good long talk to your surgeon. My only big think to say is TELL HIM (I am assuming) what concerns you, what you want to achieve and what you do not wish for - just tell him calmly and honestly- and then listen to what he has to say. I think that is hard to do in an office consult. 😊🌷",

It may not be possible depending on resources of your hospital and who is administering the sedation, but it's worth asking for it. If you are having a general anaesthetic for the following lumpectomy - you may be able to find the name of the anaesthetist - speak to them about your concerns and see if they can arrange ongoing antianxiolysis/premed for the interim 3 hours. It is not going to be a good great day but you can GET through this - and you will be better armed to make decisions about your treatments once you know what this is. As you can see from my signature - I have had \" the lot\" - I am 49 with one child. It's a tough time indeed waiting for a diagnosis.

MRI is helpful and a good suggestion - not covered entirely by Medicare/funds even with highly suspicious breasts so the guys especially in the context of cyst, calcification will book ultrasound first. For your biopsy - easier if the radiologist uses an ultrasonographer as well - they hold the ultrasound probe while the man/woman with the needle do their thing. It's ok to take Valium before the biopsy if you need it - but they should call you to tell you how to prep. In the majority of cases you can have your expander placed at the time of your surgery - and then about 6 months later get your implants popped in. Even in cases later requiring radiation - the radiation tech can work around expanders.There is also an option with a mastectomy - nipple sparring or not - that will depend on where the buggers are. But in non nipple sparring mastectomies - a plastic surgeon can create a good nipple that can then be tattooed and they look great, although you loose feeling in the area. You have good recon options - hang tight until you know exactly what you are dealing with. I won't be too far 😊🌷",

You had two lesions of 2 cm - do those two lesions give you a 1 bordering 2 stage or do we take them together - literature not wildly clear on that - aka what to do with multi focal 2. Oncotype analyses 21 genes from a breast cancer tissue but the truth be told that is NOT the entire volume of cancer that you have and we know there is considerable tumour heterogeneity. Add to this grade 3 and you know you have busy tumour material. So my personal view on oncotype - great for small cancers no nodes - and if below 10 - helps with making decision wrt chemo. Tumour gets bigger and lymph nodes, young age - it gets messier to be use. Someone is going to pull me up on that super scientific term - let's just say the sensitivity and specificity of the test is less. Which is why is recommended for...

( if they were unsure of their margin on the table, there is something called a frozen section that takes the sample to pathology and tells them how they did - it takes about 30-45 minutes of their time on the table but sure beats coming back) - your surgeon does not openly discuss your entire management plans with you as evidenced by Plavix, Oncotype, need for radiation At the risk of sounding silly I am wondering what else does HE have to do for you to seek a second opinion?? It might end up being not a lot better than the first - ( I know that) but at least you know that on your end you have explored all avenues.  Good luck - all the best, ",

Consider timing your chemo cycle (2 ( does dense a bit more intense but gets everything over quicker) or 3 weeks) work/ time off around side effects. You will probably get dexamethasone the first two days after chemo - they are steroids, help with side effects, particularly nausea and you generally have a higher energy level on them. You may also get neulasta or neupogen - to help with low white cell counts from chemo - these shots can cause bone pain ( bone marrow being stimulated ) - a drug such as Claritin helps with bone pain. If you time your chemo for Thursday pm/Friday - you will have the week/end to get over it - and may be able to return to work by Monday or Tuesday. Side effects ( many but these are common and I mention them because of the drugs you can take to combat them) - nausea - ondansetron, metoclopramide, dexamethasone - diarrhoea - lomotil - constipation - movichol, coloxyl senna, miralax - reflux/indigestion - omeprazole - insomnia - get a sleeping tablet prescribed - anxiety - Ativan - mouth sore - biotene dental, baking soda rinse, natural yoghurt, baby toothbrush On a practical level: - stock up on plastic plates and cutlery - helps with metallic taste and saves on washing - eat a little and often, stay hydrated - order food online - get some meals frozen now - tell the friends who offer to help exactly what you need them to do - simplify your clothes (I wore white only while on chemo - it was hot down here - and I did not need another thing to think about) - cut your hair short - I lost mine in the shower after the second round - one go - no mess - I would have hated to keep picking up stuff in the house - wig same as you hair now - it would look great, wrapunzel is a great site on wraps, and YouTube offers a few make up lessons - hot flushes - you could get them if not menopausal already - cotton, linen at night and layers that you can take off, cold towel by the bedside - I second the walking - even 10 minutes on bad days makes a difference - if I managed to get up and move I would soon feel better..not great but bette It's not easy and you will have a few shit days each cycle but You can do this 😊🌷 (did dose dense so two weekly - fine day 1 and almost 2, crap day 3-7, then had a reasonable week - tired though, and repeat)  ",

How well a patient tolerates the procedure, the access to lesions and the experience of the interventionalist forms the difference between the 4 and 6 bites ( making a 50% higher chance of getting diverse tissue) that you were asked for by path - and it would not take a degree in maths to work that out.😉 I also said to ask for adequate pain relief if sore. I'll get out of here before the Mods delete this. ",

Yes I meant physical therapy - I am in Australia so we get a physiotherapist with a booklet - you need to do those exercises, they are not hard but repetitive. The pillow advice gold - use their arm pillow but bring one pillow from home with you and maybe even a lamb or wool blanket - hospital beds are inevitably made of plastic covered mattresses - you will be a lot more comfortable with something natural under you. That and yoghurt or probiotics, both - between the fasting and antibiotics plus pain meds - a bowel regimen matters. We get a little cotton bag - aka messenger shape, to carry the drains. Great info on the last few posts.",

You can try it by cutting a flat oval on a piece of paper folded in half and then trying to bring the two edges together - you will see what happens. Over time scarring settles and the ends of the scar may need correcting if you want to. I have a BMX no recon. I swim with a high neck swim, cross back suit - no prosthesis - with horizontal stripes. I wear a padded sports bra in a size A, no prosthesis - I look flat but not entirely. I have small dog ears - mercifully they are central NOT underarm, and a solid surgeon will keep your underarm clean even if they have to pull a bit at the sternum. Its not just aesthetic - its the functional component of moving arm with folds that must be avoided. Physio post op essential. ",
