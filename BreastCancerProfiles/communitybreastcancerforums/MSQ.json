I have met with the surgeon, done the homework, read the reports, the forums, a zillion articles and still wonder .... will I survive this over the long term? My age is 55 and am otherwise in good health. Also, how bad will the Tamoxifen side-effects be as the list of side effects from the website and the boards is extensive, scary and depressing? The hair loss, fatigue, discharge and nausea sound wonderful. How are others doing on this medication with a similar diagnosis?

I did not realize the other radiation treatment options were available to me as the surgeon did not mention it. I will send an email and be on the phone first thing in the morning to get into a radiation oncologist first thing tomorrow. We are friends with the doctor who managed my husbands care for HPV tonsil cancer, which spread to the primary lymph node, and was caught early. Now it is my turn ... He has already sent us the contact info for the correct person for breast cancer. It was my misunderstanding that I was to wait until after the surgery to do this as some offices offer the cyberknife and others do not. Thank you for clariiying this so I can get this taken care of before and not miss out on options that may be available to me. I updated my signature as you suggested. Did not realize I needed to change the settings. There was a test on the \"Histology Image Analysis\" that was 20% (borderline) for the k167. Not really sure if this just means there is a lower chance of this spreading down the road. This type of cancer, Hormone Receptor Positive just keeps on giving. How do people catch this if this happens, ten to twenty plus years down the road?    ",

I was on hormone replacement therapy, which they do not accurately warn of the 75% chance of breast cancer, or I never would have oped for it. I am still in menopause ... but the surgeon stated I would go on the Tamoxifen. Do I contact an oncologist now before I know the results of the lymph nodes, as the option for \"cyber knife\" is available if it is negative? My surgery is on the 29th and my pre-op check up is Tuesday. I can get through the surgery and the radiation, but the meds really concern me. What will my quality of life be for at least five years, and do they put you on something else after that time has elapsed? What is the prognosis for this type of cancer as everywhere you read about this type of cancer, it can come back after twenty-years, even if it is caught early? Did you have hormone replacement therapy? They are giving this out like candy. Thank you for replying.",

The MRI measured the tumor at 10 mm. Does anyone know if fatty tissue is attached to most tumors which causes the actual size to be downgraded during the pathology that is done after a lumpectomy? I am literally on the borderline. The MO showed me the MRI and pointed to a \"puckering\" next to the tumor which he explained could be fatty tissue. I am obviously very nervous, and wondering the odds are of the tumor size being downgraded to a smaller size.",
