Since then, it had spread further and then I started to notice the soreness in my armpit and some shooting pains. I do feel like maybe some of the redness has diminished with the steroid because I'm not itching as much. I do feel like there is some heat in it now as well",

After 2 weeks and no improvement, now having pain near my armpit which I assume are swollen lymph nodes, I got an appointment with my gynecologist. She performed a breast exam and concluded that it\u2019s dermatology related and not IBC. She prescribed oral prednisone and a topical steroid cream. She wants to see me again in 2 weeks if not better to consider a biopsy. Has any experienced a misdiagnosis due to lack of swelling, heat, or orange peel? I was relieved after my appointment, but still not improving Log in to post a reply",
