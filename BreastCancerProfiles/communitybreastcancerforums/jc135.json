I called the onco nurse after I wrote this post and (practically in tears) asked her to review it with my oncologist. She just called back and said no problem, they will cut the dose by half-- to 4 mg twice a day the day before, then just 4 mg the day of tx (plus in the IV), and 4 mg twice the day after, and that's it--none on day 3 or 4, unless needed. (So, Linda/lewing, essentially what you were given.) She was quite amenable to making the change. If it turns out I need more (and can tolerate it) its certainly easier to ADD more--why start high if it may not be warranted.  She did say that with the Taxotere, it was really necessary to have some to combat the swelling.   It just goes to show, don't take anything at face value!  Research, and question! Thanks all for your input.",

I can't even have caffeine.  I am planning to take a xanax along with the decadron and hope that will ameliorate at least some of the speediness (the nurse said that would be okay.)",
