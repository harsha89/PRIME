    "Content": "Airedale wrote: Hello, I signed up yesterday because I have not found many places to get support since I have not been diagnosed yet. My stereotactic core biopsy is scheduled for tomorrow morning. The radiologist discussed PCIS with me at my diagnostic mammogram on 12/26. My questions are: do findings like mine, below, ever come out benign after biopsy? I have read that 80% are benign, but that \"pleomorphic\" word and the fact that this is a big change since last year's mammogram have me very concerned. And finally, is it normal to be experiencing breast pain, similar to first trimester breast pain? I also have pain in my armpits. I am in perimenopause (age 50), and I am not sure if this is a symptom of that, anxiety, or something else. Thank you. Report from diagnostic mammogram: Right breast: Magnification views confirm a small group of pleomorphic calcifications in the upper outer quadrant, anterior depth, 6 cm from the nipple. The calcifications span 4 x 4 x 4 mm. These are changed compared to prior mammograms. They are suspicious and stereotactic core needle biopsy is recommended. IMPRESSION: Right breast: Small group of calcifications are suspicious. Stereotactic core needle biopsy is recommended. BI-RADS 4-SUSPICIOUS FINDING. Biopsy should be considered.
