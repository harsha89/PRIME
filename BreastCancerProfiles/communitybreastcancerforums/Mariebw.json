I cannot imagine the pain you must have gone through losing your Mum, but i can only echo an earlier comment that treatments have come one hell of a long way in 20years. I'm a fellow brit (living in the US) and was diagnosed with BC in my left breast and lymph nodes in January this year, I am 37, with a 2 year old daughter and eight year old son. Your children will become stronger from this. Believe me you can get throught this, there is so much treatment available and your children will become your reason for beating this bloody disease - mine were.  I am BRCA 1 gene positive, my aunt died of ovarian cancer 20 years ago and my cousin had breast cancer age 37 and is 3 year survivor. I have done 5 months of chemo, had a bilateral mastectomy two weeks ago and am doing really well and will be having a hysterectomy in three weeks, because of the ovarian cancer risk with the gene. I had my result from my lymph nodse biopsy last week and it has come back all clear, no evidence of disease, a perfect reponse to chemo.   I am telling you all this, to prove you can fight it. It's important to get tested for the gene, so you can make more informed decisions to prevent a recurrence (hence my mastectomy and hysterectomy). It is just another piece of information which will enable you to deal with this in the best way.  As soon as you start to tackle this with treatment you will feel empowered. Keep your humor, only allow positive people into your life, accept help from friends, family, ignore the negative thoughts, comments from others. These are the best tools I have kept at my side.   Sending you, positive thoughts for your scan,  love and hugs across the pond   - you can beat this.  Marie",
