It doesn't sound like typical LE onset, but then again LE can be very unusual.  Hopefully one of the more experienced LE ladies will be able to comment soon, but in the mean time best to play it safe and get them checked out if they're still bothering you after a couple of days.  (Edited for clarity.)",

Good luck!",

(Warning: Rant beginning!!) I'm so sorry that your DRs assured you that you wouldn't get LE (makes my blood boil actually)!  From what I understand that is incorrect.  Having even just 1 node removed means your risk is very low, but will never be zero.  Add rads to that and as LtotheK mentioned above, 5 to 10% risk of developing LE is not nothing!!  Even the best surgeons and MO's are woefully lacking in LE knowledge.  My surgeon was shocked that I developed it, saying \"but lymphadema is relatively rare\" yet he knows he took 14 nodes out of me, grrrr!! Okay, rant over! ;) Whether you develop LE or not, and even if your risk is very low, it's advisable to proceed with caution and learn new techniques for, well living, but also for many activities; the \"new normal\" for each of us.  The good new is that you can be very active and excercise and do the things you love like yoga, just in a modified way.  It's so worth finding out what precautions you need to take and following them.  I buried my head in the sand and threw caution to the wind, not changing the way I used my arm, lifting heavy things, etc....5 months after my surgery I developed LE. Ask your therapist if there are any excercise programs for people with or at risk for LE in your area and research how to safely exercise so as not to trigger it (this website has a lot of info and would be a great place to start) and your new normal can be a great one! ",

One thing I do know, is that often they remain b9, so there is a good chance that your healthcare team is just being cautious. I wish I could be of more help, but at least my reply will bump your post up so hopefully someone who knows more will be along and see it! Best of luck getting the answers you need!",

The option to simply go flat is one that should be more widely known.  Before I had bc, I thought mx was a radical treatment only used for advanced bc!!!!  Sounds ridiculous I know!  Especially since I used to work in the field of biology/science, and have always been well-read about womens' health issues.  How did I not know how prevelent mx's are in the treatment of bc?!  Ironically I now find myself nearly a year on from a Stage 0 bc dx and yes, a rmx!  (Reconstruction is too much surgery and complication risks for me personally, so I'm happy to stay half flat.) People know that bc happens, but they often don't know how frequently mx's also happen, sadly I think, because society pressures women to either hide it or fix it.  Kudos to you for helping get the word out that flatness is an option too!",
