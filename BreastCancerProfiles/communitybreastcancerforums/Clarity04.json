I go to see the surgeon on tomorrow for my first check up and final lab results.  I started Tamoxifen 2 weeks before surgery has anyone else started?  Since that time I have had a rash everywhere. anyone else experienced this??",

Let them do as much as they can for you.  I will keep you in pray also.  I pray the Lord will lift you up and give you strength, comfort, peace and of course healing. ",
