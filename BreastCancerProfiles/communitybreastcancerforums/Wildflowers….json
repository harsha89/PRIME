This has definitely been the biggest challenge I have ever faced. I'm 39, and my husband and I have a 15yr old son. I never thought I would be processing this type of news this early on in life. Thankfully, both my husband and son are amazing at keeping me smiling and looking forward, and we have been blessed with incredibly supportive family and friends (and even strangers!) in our small town.  You are right about early detection. Best to be on top of your game which it sounds like you are. I'm so sorry to hear about your late husband. Wow. I seriously have no words. :,(  I pray for you and your kids, and hopefully your summer will be wonderful, and full of happiness - without the \"C word\".  Waiting to hear  (((Hugs))))",

Breast cancer can present itself in many different ways - usually different for everyone, nd I think we can all agree that when researching these breast changes, Google images will have us all in a state of panic after your first search. Lol.  In my case, after bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction, my recurrence presented itself in what looked like a torn muscle under the skin. So hard to explain. It looked like a cluster of broken blood vessels and it was raised a bit. A lot of what I've read says that IBC usually doesn't have a specific lump or tumor, but mine did. It changed quickly - within a week it was totally different than how it originally presented itself. By the time my surgeon looked at it, it covered 1/3 of my breast. I seriously thought I was having a reaction to the implant - thought maybe it was infected or something (I was still healing from surgery). I NEVER thought for one second that the cancer could be back - I had just finished 5 months of chemo, had surgery, and was on my way to recovery.  I apologize if my wording in my original response made you panic in any way - that was not my intention, and it was a bit of a knee jerk reaction.  Please let us know how things go tomorrow. Try to stay calm...I know easier said than done, but in the big picture this really probably is nothing.  Take good care.  Xo",

Initially, I thought I had torn something related to reconstruction as it looked more like a broken blood vessel - and nothing like a bruise or rash. Everyone is different, but kicks and the mods are correct - IBC is very rare, and this is very likely nothing.  Take good care",

Completed 5 months of fec100 chemo, had bilateral MX in January 2014, and thought I was in the clear. Recurrence in April 2014 stage IV, mets in chest wall and skin. I've just completed 35 rounds of rads, and now I have no idea what they have planned for me. I was told that I will heal for 6 weeks, then follow up. I'm happy to be done with radiation, but at the same time didn't want it to end because no one will tell me the next steps. I was told that they were treating me as palliative, and the rads would ease pain. They hoped to contain the cancer. Any input, or experiences you may have in this position would be very helpful.  Kelly :) ",
