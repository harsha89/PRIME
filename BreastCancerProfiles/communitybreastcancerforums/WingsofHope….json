He also elaborated a bit more on my scans.  He said the masses/nodules are either shrinking or stable and none of them show \"cancer activity\" on the Pet Scan.  He wants me to do the two more rounds of treatment (2 months) and CT scan in April.  He said if all goes well, I can move on to hormonal therapy.  What are your thoughts on this?? Don't we want the nodules GONE first???  Can I go on to hormonal with \"stable\" response????? Also, I know we don't look too much into TMs... but when I was first diagnosed with mets mine were around 38....after first treatment it went down to 27 and now those suckers ar creeping up each month.... last reading was 50.  How can things be getting better?? And lastly, my doc signed my living benefits papers.  It has 12 months or less and he was just a tad hesitant, but decided we would go for it.  I am SOOOOO hoping it is approved.  I need that financial help right now...  Plus, I want to take my son to Disney while I can. I guess that's it for now ladies.... as always thank you for your responses. (HUGS) ~dana~ Dx 11/12/2008, IDC, Stage IV, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

As I stated in my introduction, I was dx'd with lung mets last week.  My Onc referred me for a PET scan and Brain MRI before starting treatment.  Is this normal?  Wouldn't the PET scan include the brain?  I had a CT before the latest diagnosis. I realize this is to determine whether the cancer has spread to other places.  I feel SOOOO overwhelmed.  I had the PET today... and I just wanted to squeeze the tech into telling me what she saw LOL..... If all goes well, I am scheduled to start the weekly Abraxane on Wed.  I haven't been able to find to many people with experience on this chemo.  I paid for a bus trip to NYC on December 6th...but I am not sure how I will feel after these treatments.

I have been doing really well - so much so that I get nervous if it is working yet!!! On both infusions I did get a minor bout of diarhea once I got home. Not sure what that's about. So I just stayed close to home the first 24 hours. After that I feel fine. I have noticed a little dry mouth - I am going to ask about that this week. (Hugs) and I wish you the best. ~d~",
