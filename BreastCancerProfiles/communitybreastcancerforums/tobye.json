My rad onc also insisted my breathing problems couldn't be from RADS .... she did suggest motrin .... she thought maybe I was subconsciously trying to avoid sternum pain from RADS by not fully inflating my lungs. I am feeling a lot better so I didn't try it. The key for me seems to be not pushing myself .... I cannot do all the stuff I used to in one day. I also cannot rush - that brings on the breathing thing. Hang in there, I hope you both feel better soon.",

Probably made worse because I was returning to work that Monday. Initially, xanax helped in the hospital. Now I find that meditation helps, and I had to reduce my work schedule and stop trying to do everything I did before all this started. My best to you both .... I know exactly how this feels. Perhaps for peace of mind, have the docs check everything such as heart, lungs, etc. Best wishes.",
