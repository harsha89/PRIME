I also had a referral to go see breast surgeon after my OBGYN felt the thickening on my left breast. She told me regardless of the mammo and ultrasound finding, I should go see breast surgeon. My mammo cameback with bi-rads 3 but there were no abnormality. I think the bi-rads 3 grade is due to the fact that I told the radiologist that I have a new thickening and that I have a \"directive\" from my OBGYN that I have to see a breast surgeon. Just like you, I was made anxious just by the fact that my OBGYN was telling me to go see BS. Like \"what does she know that I don't?\". Now I think it's just their protocol to refer patients to BS when there are changes to the breast that cannot be ruled out as benign. It's always better to find out early than late so all the testing and procedures you have to go through is so that if there is something, they can find it early. If after all the test, nothing comes up, then all the more better. I have my MRI scheduled next Friday. I am nervous, anxious, and worried even as I'm going through this but I have to remind myself that this is all for my best. One step at a time. Best of luck to you.",

Even though the radiologist didn't see anything, apparently there is a note in the lab result indicating left breast showing \"thickening glandular tissue\". Also, the thickening is still palpable even to my novice fingers. I'd like to know what they are for sure. I wonder if they do biopsies on glandular tissues? .. Will let the board know if anything changes with my breasts or diagnosis. Thank you for being here for me. Can't tell you how much this helps.",

Granted I am not diagnosed yet with BC, I take a lot of comfort reading the discussion board here. I can read from the entries how so many ladies(and gents) went through this hel*ish ordeal and still have so much compassion for others. I can also see the strength and courage with which they're all fighting this disease with, which makes me thing that I too can do this if it ever turns out I have(or will have)BC. I keep staring down at my breasts and can't feel a bit resentful. I'm sure I appreciated them when they made my clothes look nice and giving milk to my new born son, but I am not enjoying them right now... Will take the advice of keeping busy till Monday. Somewhere in all this, I'm sure there is a lesson to be learned and peace to be found. Strange how I feel completely okay to be vulnerable and scared here but have to hide my fear from my husband and son.",

      "Content": "Mar 28, 2015 04:31PM - edited Mar 28, 2015 04:35PM by shoppingchicken Hi Rhiannon. Sorry about your diagnosis. I just had my MRI done past Friday and it was not an easy experience but I got through it. Heed the member's advice(all very good advice) above and if you have xanax or ativan, take more than you usually might need. I took 50mg xanax (was scared to take more since I had to drive later on) and thought it would be enough but I think it barely did the job. They gave me the ear plugs but the machine is LOUD. You will still hear quite a bit of buzzing and beeping. I asked for a headphone which was a mistake. With your head down and no view other than the bed sheets an inch away from your face, having the bulky headphone made me more claustrophobic. It gave me the sensation of being smothered under the blanket. After they wheeled me in, I had to ask them to wheel me out and take the headphone off. At that point, I did think I was having a panic attack. What got me back in the machine was thinking that I would have come back and do this all over again. No way No how. I was get it done! It does take about 1/2 hour just being in the machine. I was not allowed to wiggle at all during the entire time even when the machine stops and restarts intermittently. The nurse was very specific. She said if I move, we have to restart. The beeping-buzzing noise differs from time to time. I am assuming they're taking different types of imaging? I tried to visualize calming images but that didn't really work for me. What did work was just counting from 10 to 1 slowly over and over again and breathing along. Just concentrated on the numbers and nothing else. I just said to myself \"count the numbers, count the numbers, count the numbers\".... I get my results either on Monday or Tuesday. Good luck to you and best wishes.",

Glad it over with and with positive result. Radiologist didn't know why the thickening is only on my left and didn't say it's fibrocystic breast either. Said it's something I need to keep an eye(or finger) on for any changes. As I posted earlier, I still have to go see the breast surgeon as per my OBGYN (she said to go see one regardless of my mammo/US results), but am feeling much better today. I will continue to read and participate in the discussion board. Now that I look at it, this is something I have to worry about for the rest of my life, not just this year. Thank you all for reading my post. I will be around.",

I only noticed the thickening maybe this past fall and yes, my OBGYN doctor during clinical exam noticed the difference between the two breast right away. I have an appointment with breast surgeon even after a clear mammo and ultra sound(I was a nervous wreck for a whole week). My OBGYN office thinks this is the best way to manage what maybe happening to my breast. Quote \"mammogram and ultra sounds are only tools. They cannot take place of the surgeon's expertise\". Perhaps another follow up with BS is what puts your mind at ease. I have no lumps per se but general thickening (what the radiologist called thickening glandular tissue) on upper outer quadrant in my left breast, same as you. Good luck and I'd be interested in your progress..",
