I have been looking for a double mastectomy pillow for her but have no idea where to start. If anyone can give me any ideas I would so appreciate it. I would also like to put together a post surgery box for her with everything she could use and need. She has 2 young children as well. Any recommendations would be so amazing. Shes terrified of the surgery and I just figure if I can even do these small things maybe it can help even in the tiniest bit. Thanks everyone Candice (worried sister) Log in to post a reply",
