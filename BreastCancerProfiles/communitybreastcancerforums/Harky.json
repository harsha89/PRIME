A friend of mine recommended this other radiologist near our town who came from the Mayo clinic . Since I don't want to go through this again, it seems like a good idea to have someone else look things over . Unfortunately he's on vacation till the end of the month .",

My surgeon wants to do a biopsy. Has anyone ever gotten a second opinion from another radiologist before doing the biopsy ? I would have to go to another town about 60 miles away and they might want me to repeat the test on their equipment andI'm not willing to have three mammograms in one year . That's too much radiation . Log in to post a reply",
