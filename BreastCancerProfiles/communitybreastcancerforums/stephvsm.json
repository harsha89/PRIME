I have gone to the doctor, had mammograms and utlrasound and nothing shows up except an enlarged lymph node. but the doctors are not concerned. I have had 2 lumpectomy's on the same breast both benign. I am really frustrated because I have been to the dermatologist and it isn't eczema or anything like that. I don't have crusty or flaking. Just major itching and the areola is slightly darker than the left one. Has anyone had anything like this that comes back as cancer or Paget's? I feel like I am crazy because the doctors keep saying nothing is wrong. thanks. Log in to post a reply",
