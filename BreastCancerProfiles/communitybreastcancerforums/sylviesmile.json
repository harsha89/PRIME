    "Content": "sylviesmile wrote: diagnosed 3 years ago, stage 2 breast cancer, . Had double massectomy, one lymph node involved ( but 16 removed). test were saying low medium chance of recurrence. I decided to not go through typical chemo, but for an alternative treatment, involving \"low dowse chemo\" that were targeted to my specific type of cancer, (EST+) and other plenty of stuff . I changed my eating habit to very low sugar and ate everything I could organic. Thought I was out of the wood..... I found a little cyst on my scar, one day, and checked,. it did seems to grow was very superficial. Went to see a surgeon, who said it was a suture cyst and he will removed it at the same time he will change my implant as I had built up a lot of scar tissue and capsular contractur on the side of my cancer. I delayed my surgery 6 month , working for a small company to find the right time to take off. One week later, the doc called me to tell me that they had found cancer cell in the cyst and I should get back asap to an oncologist. I choose to go to MD anderson , 5 hours away from the small town I am living in Texas. THey found bones metastasis on my bones, scapula, humerus, hip, etc...... I was put on Letrozole (femara and Ibrance. 1 month later an excruciating pain in the middle of my back sent me to the emergency room, where they found I had 2 vertebra with compression fracture. Was put on a brace and received 10 round of radiations. Sent home I had lost all my muscle and lost all my muscles. and all the medecines I was put on (steroid and 10mg of oxycontin twice a day) were making me tired and dizzy. After 2 weeks starting to get a little better with home health care coming home to help me for shower ( could not remove trhe brace without being seated) I suddenly lost consciencness, and my daugter saved my life, calling 911. Had a pulmonary ambolism, that can occur when taking Ibrance. Was immediately put of the Ibrance by MDAnderson. I they added nedecine blood thinner Warfarin. They check a level of blood clotting to adjust the right dose of medicine until it stable, and iI was good when I got out of the hospital, then my level dropped of INR went down to 1 instead of between 2 and 3. Had to get shot in my stomach, and I am bak to 2,8 ( what they want ) so a little relief. . I am now Letrozole only until I get back to MD Anderson on sept 27 for complete evaluation. I am a fighter and keep a good spirit , depite, every move I make scare me as I still did not recover to have a steady balance, and walk with a walker, have a hard time to just dress or just stand for w while without felling weak. My oncologist in my little towm who work with MD Anderson ( they communicate info) addressed does not seems to see all the problems, Because of the OxyContin I am now suffering of impacted stool and hemorrhoids and I cannot even describe what I have to do to get rid of some blocked stool. Taking 4 docusate + a day, 800 mg pills of magnesium citrate, drinking close to 1,5 to 2 quart of water\u2026.. and *mcg of amitiza ( a medicine for IBS syndrome, but if taken at higher dose @$ mcg is for opiatre constipation , so for people taking oxycontin, ) I would like to regain strength and do myself exercises that on physical therapist gave me when I was at the hospital\u2026. But I know it's not enough. I feel I am alone in that battle some day and I have to call almost everyday the oncologist. My husband and daughter had to go back to work and I only have a visit of a voluntary friend who come 2 a day and I can communicate with if noting happen to my phone\u2026\u2026 If any of you had been in this kind of situation, and feel that every time your do a step forward , a new problem occur,,,,,, or had similar problem, please let me know . Does some of you taken Amitiza at higher dose and did you have side effect ( right now I don\"t have any) except I cannot go to the restroom . Any, any of your help and positive output, let me know.
