      "Content": "Jan 6, 2014 07:56PM - edited Jan 6, 2014 08:07PM by sabihah As far as I can tell, most genetic counselors (GC's) have a background in genetics + psychology + nursing, or some similar combination.  If you want genetic testing or if you're concerned that the cancer in your family may be hereditary, you usually go to a GC.  A GC can help you create a \"cancer family tree\" (technically called a pedigree chart), where you list everyone in your family who has had cancer, what specific type of cancer it was, and at what age they were diagnosed.  They prefer to go back 3 generations if possible, but they'll take what they can get.  Actually, it's best if you can do the legwork to get all of this data before your first GC appointment.  (FYI, GC's can also talk about other diseases that can run in families, not just cancer.) Using your family tree, the GC will determine if the pattern of cancer in your family seems to indicate that hereditary cancer may run in your family.  If there is a good chance that the cancer in your family is hereditary, they will tell you that you are a good candidate for genetic testing, and they can order the testing for you, if you want to do that.  If the cancer in your family doesn't seem to be hereditary, they will tell you you're not a good candidate for genetic testing.  Sometimes they'll tell you that someone else in your family should be tested, but not you.  It's all a bit complicated, but the GC's job is to explain everything and help you make your own decisions. There are definite downsides to finding a genetic mutation (like possibly not being able to get life insurance any more), and GC's are trained in talking you through your options so you can make an informed decision.",

I was just researching scuba diving after mastectomy, because I'm also an avid scuba diver.  I'm hoping it will be easier to return to diving after a PBMX where I (hopefully) won't have to deal with treatment for breast cancer and the things that come with it (lymphedema, chemo, and radiation).  That's what I tell myself anyway - get the mastectomy *before* the cancer gets me!",
