My face and throat swoll up and I could not breathe. As I was getting my chemo at home I had loads of paramedics turning up (nice looking ones too) The nurse adminstering the chemo used an epipen and adrenaline and put me on oxygen, and I was duly carted off to hospital. Through her I heard that my oncologist will not allow me to get Taxotere again. As Taxotere appears to be the \"gold standard\" drug I am concerned what I am going to get instead. Rather than trawling though google please let me know what suggested replacements are in the system. Lari",
