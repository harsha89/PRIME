Anyway, real question I should have asked is- what is the risk reduction of the 15% risk on non-cancerous side if I have mastectomy? Because she said that that side is not the life threatening side (is that because they would catch earlier? or ???) my guess is she would not support its removal and that is why she did not bring up that option.  Does anyone know the answers to these questions?  Especially the risk reduction due to prophy mastectomy?  Also, when do they usually like to do it?

Gotta add that to the items for discussion with the onc. KerryMac- you are so close to finshing this stuff... go for it. I was looking at your stats and I am so close to you. I was Dx in 11/08, am 43, 6cm+, grade 2 and 6/10, er+, pr- (or slightly positive) and her2-.  and live very near you.  We should hook up at Sunnybrook after one of my chemos/your rad in next few weeks. ",

Even without bc, and with only 2 other kids, I was exhausted for 2 years following birth of #3. If I had to add 2 other kids in there and bc treatment, I would be flat out in bed..... I think you may have been running so hard in the last 9 months, that you have hit the wall.  Now, the wall might crumble around you, or you might be able to keep it up, but it will certainly be weakened.  Go take it easy.  I wouldn't expect your energy level to return for another 2 or 3 years.... about the same time that diapers are banished!  ",

      "Content": "thisisme wrote: So I have just been diagnosed with mets and am not quite sure what is in store for me.  I need your advice on what you have been through and what it has been like so that I can make some plans.   I am a single mom of 3 boys. I used to live in Toronto where me the boys had our friends and activities all set up and other than a bad marriage were relatively happy. Then last year I moved the 4 of us to Vancouver, across the country. I did this for 2 reasons. 1) to escape the marriage and that seemed the best way at the time and 2) to be closer to my 2 sisters in case of a Stage IV diagnosis.... which has now happened.  I didnt want to die alone.  So I have been in Vancouver for a year and my kids hate, hate,hate it.  They have no friends, I also have found the last year really lonely as all my friends are in Toronto and I have not made a single Vancouver friend.  Who has time between work and trying to keep the 3 boys entertained so they dont cry about living in Vancouver.  .I am totally stressed and, to be honest, my family has been of limited help.  They have known how stressful it has been to be here on my own with the 3 boys and they have not offered to help.  Not even to take kids for a few hours so I can get haircut or do groceries.  Maybe I looked like I was coping too well! Although I did point blank ask them if they could consider helping me out once in a while.  Anyway, they are busy with their own families and friends. Anyway, since the mets Dx 1 month ago, they have been coming to doc appts with me and helping me make some decision,etc.  But still not helpful with the kids. I now have an opportunity to return to Toronto.  In Toronto I would have friends that would help with the kids, ie take them for the weekend, have them over for playdates, pick up from school etc, but no one to look after me, in the way that family does (ie holding my hair back as I puke, sitting with me after having a mastectomy, holding my hand at onc appts, etc  as they did when first diagnosed).But I would have friends to go to dinner with our out to the movies, etc.    Here is where I need your help.  I know that  no one can predict this stuff, but how hard has treatment been for you?  Could you have managed with just limited help around the house and to look after you?  I pretty much made it through the chemo at first Dx on my own, with my husband ignoring me but totally looking after the kids.  Could this journey be much worse than those first chemos?  I can afford to get some temp help in during the tough times but not all the time full time.  How would you have coped if you were doing this on your own? I really need to make the Vancouver/Toronto decision by December.  I would appreciate any thoughts on the limited benefits of family looking after you vs, friends for enjoyment!  Maybe other single moms can comment??? Thanks all for your wisdom as we take this journey.....

Wow, Lena, you are a planner extra-ordinaire!  While reading your post I could not help but wonder what a man in our situation would do? Would he spend his last \"healthy\" day cleaning the house and grocery shopping or programming the TV to tape his favourite shows?  Would he be grocery shopping or off to the baseball game?  Just wondering!

Anyway, went straight to my GPs office and asked for some Ativan.  I just felt that after waiting 2 months for the mammo and then 4 weeks for the biopsy, I could not hold it together any longer.  Plus now wait 1 week for result, which must be cancer from the look of those films.  Oh, after the biopsy I walked through the cancer centre and thought, okay, i can do this.  I watched 2 young women checking in for radiation and they were laughing, It was almost like they were buying tickets to a movie they were going to see.  When I saw them,I felt reassured that this can be dealt with and it can have positive moments. This morning I just felt overwhelmed and slipped one of those little Ativan guys under my tongue and it has been amazing.  I have been able to think about this and even talk about it without going into panic mode, I have felt calm for the first time in months and am feeling like I can take whatever is given to me.  Please, if you feel like I did... almost shaking with panic and spontaneous crying without warning, etc then please do ask for help.  You will be able to focus and make better decisions. Thanks for all the support I have had here.  I have a question.  What is a SNB? If they biopsied a node yesterday, is that a SNB?  Oh, one more piece of advice- take some extra strenght tylenol with you to have after the biopsy as it hurts a bit once freezing comes off.  But do not take any aspirin based products!
