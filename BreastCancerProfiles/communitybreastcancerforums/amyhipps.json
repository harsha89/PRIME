    "Content": "amyhipps wrote: I had previously posted that the doc and radiologist said everything looked okay to them, but as it develops out my doctor talked to her oncologist and he said that he thinks i should have either an MRI, Biopsy or some image test. He said it maybe best if i went ahead and had the biopsy to rule it out. I'm still stunned, first they said it looked alright and now. The Dr. said that their was a low chance of it being cancer but it can never be ruled out. I think what scares me even more is my blood results came back and everything was perfect including my red and white blood count, though i know that means nothing. I've had this lump for maybe a year to three, i'm scared that if it is not benign that i've waited too long. What am i to expect? I've had several people including doctors say it sounds like fibrocystic breasts or lump, but i'm starting to doubt that. Is there also anything where i can talk to women my own age, also is their any counseling for my mother and younger sister, they are just as worried as i am, if not more. Log in to post a reply",
