I don't know exactly what chemo she is going to receive but I'll let u know tomorrow after we come back from the Onc. I know it's an aggresive one. And yes the Stats are my moms, and so is the picture, that's her with my daughter, she was working when my baby girl was born, she recieved her! :) She is an RN at the Nursey at the hospital my princess was born. Lots of health and blessings Juleisy",

This has been one of the toughest things we as a family have gone through. But u know what just knowing that u guys are doing great just makes us feel so much better. You ladies are true warriors and I bow to you. My mother will begin Chemo on Friday, 4 rounds, one every 3 weeks and then Tamoxifen for 5 years.We live in Puerto Rico and we know very little breast cancer patients, I am glad we found a place were we can visit when we are feeling down.  BTW: Can u please tell us what to expect for Chemo. I know it's not a piece of cake but it's doable right? My love and blessings to all of u!! Juleisyd!!",
