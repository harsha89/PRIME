Am I being too hopeful to hang on to my hair until May 22 (12 days post tx)?  That is her hs graduation. Stay strong...you all seem to be doing so well. Sue ",

Although I feel better, don't know if I could stay all day at work...not sure whether I should try or not. Lonely at home but have to think about what is best for my health.  Also concerned about going on short term disability because my daughter starts college in the fall so money is critical. Stay strong and positive (this is the hard part for me but am working on it). Sue ",

Hope everyone is doing well today.  Have a doc appt this afternoon and am anxious about my port.  Im sure they will want to use it for blood work but I'm afraid it is going to be really painful.   Going to get the hair cut really, really short Sunday after graduation ceremony.  One more step into the unknown on this journey... ",

Cyborg, I might being doing the same as you.  I guess we need to put ourselves first to do the best job possible. Also working hard to want to eat...I've lost weight and I know I need to build up strength to be able to endure the rest of the txs. ",
