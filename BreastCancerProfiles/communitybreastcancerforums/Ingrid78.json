They then found that the cancer had spread to the lymph system and had to reopen the wound to take out some of her lymph nodes. In January of this year she developed a severe infection in the wound spreading across her chest. She is also suffering from Lymphedema. The specialist physio will not work with her until the infection is cleared. The most frustrating and depressing thing is that she had now tried 4 different antibiotics and the side effects are that severe that she cannot take any of them. At the age of 67 Mum was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer and she made the decision not to have any chemo or radiation. This is a decision that her family has obviously had to support her in. My main aim now is to try and find a treatment for the infection so that she regains some quality of life back. My question to anyone reading this is can you recommend a specialist in Queensland (we are from the Sunshine Coast) or within Australia. Mum has been using alternative treatments so also interested in anyone with knowledge on this or your own experiences with fighting infection. Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",
