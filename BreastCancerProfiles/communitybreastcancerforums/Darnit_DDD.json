I had similar pain in my left arm a few days after surgery so I asked my surgeon about it. She said it was common and would pass, and that sometimes it hits after a couple of weeks after surgery, so I have not called the office about the right arm and assume it will pass. The right arm is where the SNB was performed. I\u2019m just not sure if I should be stretching, or if that exacerbates it? It is additional pain no one needs, and would really like to leave Advil behind. Hang in there",

I've been digging through the boards and see this is a common challenge, I do have lot of tissue and should probably temper my expectations, but clearly define in writing what I'm hoping to achieve.

I had my annual mammogram In early Jan and got a letter a few days later asking me to schedule another visit. I wasn\u2019t at all worried, I have dense breasts and didn\u2019t give it much thought. I had Plans and errands to run following the second mammogram, but then the radiologist came in and said I needed a biopsy. Man, I did not see that coming at all. I left there in a daze and headed home in shock, called my wife and sisters, and sat there in quiet solitude and disbelief. The biopsy was not too bad, but be sure and eat before you go. My breast was tender for a couple of days and I slept in a bra for a few nights. Unfortunately the news was not what I was hoping for, but, I focus on the positives and look forward to the healing journey. Let us know how it\u2019s going, hang in there",

My BS told me due the size of my breasts I\u2019ll likely have dog ears but hopefully insurance will cover a scar revision surgery to address the redundant tissue down the line. I\u2019m sorry to hear of your recurrence, best of luck to you, this is a wonderful community here and I know you\u2019ll find alot of great info and wonderful support here. ",
