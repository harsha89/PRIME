From my research I thnk that I prefer Faslodex. I would sincerely appreciate your opinion on this as at the moment I am very stressed out trying to decide what to do. I want to make an informed choice. Also I am trying to find out what the cost of Faslodex in Australia is. Thankyou and best wishes",
