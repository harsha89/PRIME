Had a lumpectomy before genetic testing came back, which was positive for BRCA2. So after chemo I will have a mastectomy and whatever my gynecologist suggests when I meet with her later. I started chemo yesterday, six rounds of TAC. Both tumors are triple negative, but less than 2cm and no lymph nodes, so Stage I. I'm lucky we caught it early! Chemo itself wasn't bad. I was mostly nervous but my nurses were supportive and helpful. I'm glad I got a port and six days after that surgery it's healing nicely. So far no bad side effects. Only very minor nausea, but I can still eat and I usually feel better when I do. I get my Neulasta shot today and am hoping taking Claritin (started a few days ago) will only give minor bone pain. Good luck everyone!",
