I found out just this past Friday afternoon (12APR) that the spot was NOT cancer and I will be at the \"Chemo Bar\" with my 1st \"cocktail\" this Tuesday-16APR!  (Loved that reference someone posted earlier.)  I know not what kind, how many treatments, how long they will be . . . Nuthin' at this point!  I am also one of the many completely terrified of this next step!  In fact, through hysterical tears,  I begged my surgeon to glue my boobs back on and cut them off again instead of having to go through chemo.  She hugged me and promptly gave me crazy pills.  (Husband wants me to call them happy pills, but I'm really not happy I wasn't mentally strong enough to beat back the terror by myself - hence I call them crazy pills!)  Have to admit, they work!!  My rational side, although still scared, is now stronger than the hysterical side. This is where my THANKS comes in!  Although I will find out for sure what's going on Tuesday, I feel pretty well informed - well, enough to ask informed questions on Tuesday. How my Tuesday will play out: - Early morning \"fill\" in the TE's (PS told me best time for fills are right before treatments to avoid infection possibilities) - To infusion clinic for port to be accessed (Thanks for letting me know to ask for the numbing cream in advance!) - Blood work (Yay port!  No more sticks!) - Meet with oncology doctor to find out what I'm getting, etc     (Depending how long the wait is - a quick run to the hospital wig shop to see about their complimentary wig program) - Infusion begins!    Will request the ice mitts or bowls for fingers and toes.      (Husband has threatened to handcuff us together to make sure I don't go running, screaming from the room before they can get me hooked up!) So it looks like I am also going to be one of this wonderful team of April sisters!  Scared.  Hopeful.  NOT wanting to lose my hair!  Doing my darned-est to be a brave fighter! Again, thanks for sharing your journey here.  Whether you are informing, venting, or simply killing time with your \"cocktail,\" I'm so glad you are there.   I only hope I can return the favor for someone else someday.",

Have another question for you too.  Good friend that wants to \"help\" is suggesting I get some CoQ10.  I won't really do anything without asking the onco first, but curious if anyone has any experience with this type of vitamin.  Happy thoughts to everyone!

Couple positive / re-affirming notes: - My Cancer center made that Chemotherapy CD (by Belleruth Naparstek) available to anyone.  I have also downloaded it.  Great for those days with no energy, but unable to sleep.  Very calming.  If you have access to it, I feel its worth it. - My 3rd infusion also kicked me for the longest time too.  Made me realize it should be illegal for docs to be allowed to make us fell so bad!  - Although I wear glasses, I also have that blurry eye thing from time to time.  Doesn't last long though.  Makes reading hard for a day, but clears up with no additional drugs. Now a question for you: At my 4th infusion today, I meet with the Doc 1st to check blood work, how'd the last one go, yada, yada.  Told him about an unexplained pain in my arm below Petunia (my Port).  Ice, position, sleeping, nothing seems to help minimize it.  He okays the 4th infusion but also orders a test on my arm for blood clots.  SURPRISE!  I'm a winner!  Never had these before.  Now, along with everything else (scared of the cumulative effects of 4 already!) I get to start Coumadine and watch my Vitamin K intake, with more trips to the doc for blood tests!  UGH! Anyone experience this?  Did it all go okay?  Any tips to offer? I think I'm going to embrace the concept mentioned earlier regarding finding something to spoil yourself and have my nails done before the chemo effects completely knock me down! Good day to everyone, and minimum SE's to all!!",
