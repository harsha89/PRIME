Now it does get worse at the {time of the month but that doesnt mean it stops at that} One time i woke up and they hurt so bad when i was a teen that i was holding my breast because it felt like i was carring a backpack full of bricks. They are sharp pains on the top and bottom of my breast. I got a mammogram finally and then they sent me for another mammogram then to the hospital for altrasound then get a call back and tell me a Â biopsy two different ones. The one couldnt not show up because i had so many of what they didnt know what they was yet or density also they said they couldnt do the biopsy and told me i could have it removed now as a precation or wait a year and come back and have it looked at again. but the other biopsy came back as fibroadenomas. every thing i have read says they are not painful and i am hear to tell you thats a load of bull. Cancer runs in my family and i have found out when you open up some ones body it is more likey to spread so untill they tell say i have no choice they are not touching me.. good luck",
