Your story sounds so similar to mine - when I went to the ER after my  mx with free-tram - I was stuck in that hospital for an additional 2 weeks.........most of the care was good..........but on two separate occasions I had to literally BEG the night nurses to give me my pain meds! Same thing happened - I was always the \"good girl\".........trying to be polite and considerate........until finally I realized that they did NOT understand how seriously ill I was and how high my pain levels. Even if you tell them your pain level is a \"10\".......if you're smiling and joking, they don't \"get it\". After a week in the hospital..........and being \"forgotten\" on two nights in a row.........I totally lost it! I dragged myself out of bed, IV pole in hand - a blanket draped over my head.........stood in the darkened hallway and screamed, \"WHERE ARE MY PAIN MEDS!\" (this after ringing for a nurse for over an hour.) Let me tell you - my pain meds came IMMEDIATELY! Lol! I learned the hard way, \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease!\"  My bad experience happened over a year ago........it took me this long to recover from the mrsa, surgery, blood transfusions, chemo and emotional duldrums to finally contact a malpractice lawyer. But two different lawyers said it'd be nearly impossible to prove my case.........so now I'm wondering if it's even too late to write a letter of complaint to the hospital administrator? Still,  I figure, \"better late than never\"..........at that time, I DID complain to the social worker on staff - and to the head of the nursing staff (two nurses were reprimanded for forgetting me)..........but I really need to complain about the doctors on staff who all bowed down in homage to my bc surgeon and plastic surgeon, nearly killing me in the process. Lursa I'm so happy you were able to go home the next day.............another lesson learned.........when possible, have a family member stay over-night with you - we are truly at the mercy of budget cuts and understaffed hospitals.

I can't stress how sick I felt - my PCP was ready to hospitalize me again, until he noticed the \"slight\" dehydration problem in my blood work. The nurse suggested the Gatorade - it was like a miracle drug. I couldn't believe the difference it made!  Pam I'm also sending hugs your way regarding the stress level in your home, especially with your new teen driver and the car accident. It's unbelievable what we have to deal with as BC patients - the parental responsibilities just don't go away. My daughter is begging me to let her drive alone to her camp job in July, but I refused because I told her even though she got her driver's license last year, she hasn't driven a car for the entire year (no car in college) and in my opinion, she's not ready to go solo. Also - I told her - even if she feels ready - I'm not ready for the added stress, especially worrying about accidents.......I told my 3 kids - I can't deal with any more illnesses or doctor visits, they REALLY must try to stay well and healthy this summer!  Yesterday, my daughter's cat ate half of a 200mg ibuprophen tablet that was on the floor and started vomiting. Half the day was spent at the vets........$350 later.....3 different pills that the cat won't take - more vomiting this morning, and probably another visit to the vet and possible hospitalization for the cat because he might have damaged his kidneys. The cat really is part of our family, so this added stress has made me very teary-eyed all morning.  Anyway Pam - hang in there and please get stronger every day!",

I'm following what's happening to you because I've been to my LE therapist three times now and she's is sooo different from yours! She took my entire history, and arm measurements - does massage therapy - gave me printed exercises to perform - talks to me about her sweet little 4 year old, I really like her so much - and I hope you'll find a therapist you like also. I haven't had my arm wrapped at all - but my swelling was very slight so it may not be necessary. She said she will measure me for a compression sleeve if and when I decide I need to fly somewhere, but since I rarely travel by air, it won't be a problem for now. Binney I was interested in reading about the foam quilt garments - do you think I should ask my therapist if I need that for my abdomen? It still feels tight and swollen, especially at night or if I've done more exercise during the day. Today it feels fine - but I did absolutely  nothing at all today. It seems such a shame - that exercise exacerbates the lymphedma problem when it is so important for healing and maintaining good health in the long run! I can't WAIT to get back into the pool and start swimming my laps......Swmmom, I hope you will learn to swim - your 12 year old daughter sounds like she'll be an excellent instructor AND a great business woman too!  My kids all swam competitively - it's a wonderful sport because where kids of all ages can swim together on the same team. Even when my son was only 6 years old, he swam with the \"big kids\" on the same team as my daughters......you don't see that with soccer or basketball!",

Binney - thanks again for all your advice......I saw my PCP yesterday and he poked around in my abdomen and wrote a prescription for a Cat scan to rule out a hernia. He said this is the only way to know for sure. I'm hoping my insurance approves it - normally they don't give me any problems, but I've had so many procedures already, who knows? My PCP asked me, if the Cat scan DOES show a hernia, do I want my plastic surgeon to perform the repair? I said \"absolutely not!\" Although my PS is great with mico-vascular surgery (my Diep was successful in my \"foob\" - no problems with fat necrosis or anything there), I don't think I want him poking around inside my abdomen anymore! Maybe I'll change my mind - my PS is a very nice gentleman, I just don't get the feeling he takes my complaints about my swollen stomach seriously. I see him tomorrow, at which time I'll mention how I'm going to get a Cat scan - I'm dying to see his reaction to that. Also - I'm going to tell him that my LE therapist AND breast cancer surgeon (who performed the mastectomy) both said my breast is NOT swollen - that it's so bulky because of the fat tissue that is there. My PS keeps telling me that it'll get smaller when the swelling goes down - but there IS no swelling......it's like he moved ALL the fat from my lower abdomen to the one breast. There was enough there for TWO size C breasts.....right now it feels like DD breast - most of it on the side, under my arm, and it is soooo heavy! I feel like I need a bra with super-support to hold it up! I really want him to finally ADMIT that the breast is too large and to agree to make it smaller when he performs Stage 2. Of course, that probably won't happen for a year, when I finish the Herceptin. Sorry to ramble on - and thanks again ladies for all your kind advice!",

I'm a weird case - my onc put me on Navelbine even though my tumor was Stage 1 Grade 1 - because I'm Her2+, he wanted me on Herceptin, but Herceptin works better in combination with other chemo drugs. He chose Navelbine for me because of its light side-effects - it won't cause any heart problems (Herceptin will) and it won't cause total hair loss (although my hair has gotten thinner.) I get my infusions every two weeks. The main side effects I've experienced with Navelbine are as follows:  burning and heavy feeling in my arm (they tried a medi-port for me, but after it got infected, they're using my veins.) The solution to the burning feeling was for the nurse to run the Navelbine at the SAME time as a bag of saline - the arm pain (which had lasted a week) was totally gone! The other side effect I experience is painless diarhhea - it hits me about 2 hours after my infusion and lasts for about 4 hours. Then it's totally gone. When I switched oncs, the new nurses gave me (as they routinely do) premeds: Decadron (a steroid) and Zofran (anti-nausea meds). This was unnecessary for me since I never got nauseous on the Navelbine and Herceptin. The premeds were AWFUL - the Decadron kept me up all night for two nights in a row - and the Zofran gave me painful constipation for 3 days - my belly swelled up and the cramping was so bad I felt like I was giving birth! So I told them to forget the pre-meds - they cause more problems than they cured. So I'm back now to just Navelbine (with saline) and Herceptin. The only other side effect I noticed is a bit of tiredness - but that could be from the Herceptin - or from anxiety. Otherwise I've been perfectly fine - and once they removed the infected port, I was able to return to swimming and my energy level has been getting better every week. The onc does check my counts every week - but so far they haven't dropped low enough for any concern. I hope my story gives you confidence Bernice that Navelbine will be much easier to tolerate than your prior chemo experiences. Hang in there - and be sure to tell the nurses any side effects you experience.",

That made all the difference in my treatment - even though my tumor was only a Stage 1, Grade 1, ER+ and PR+ - even with an Oncotype DX score of 22 (which is low-intermediate) I had a uni-lateral mx with immediate reconstruction (and a lot of infections afterwards). I should have just waited to make this decision after getting the breast MRI (which showed no other abnormalities). A lumpectomy with rads has the same survival rates as a mastectomy...........however..........the more important decision you'll have to make will be concerning chemo treatment - do you need it or not? Did you get an Oncotype DX test done? Was your tumor Her2- or equivacal? If equivacal, you need to get the FISh test done - if the tumor is Her2+, you'll need Herceptin with chemo for a year. I understand how difficult all these decisions are............good luck and may God's angels watch over you! P.S. Edited to add - after my breast cancer dx 3 years ago, my thyroid was tested and showed to be hypothyroid and was immediately put on a low dose of Synthroid every day. It never interfered with any of my chemo/Herceptin/Arimidex treatments.",

I ended up asking for the reports after being encouraged to do so by my insurance company follow-up nurse (who was the best support person I had during my long ordeal). She would call me every two weeks and gave me fantastic advice. I started doubting that I received a true Diep when I saw a bulge just above my abdominal incision - my PS was so dishonest - he kept suggesting that I gained weight (I lost weight) or that it was \"post-surgical swelling\". After I saw my operative reports, I went to my PCP and he ordered a Cat scan. Even then, the radiologist did not see a hernia - but he did report on a defective abdominal muscle. Thanks to BethNYC here at bc.org, I went to a hernia specialist with my CD - he took one look at it, then showed me the scan on his laptop and said that it WAS a hernia - but a radiologist wouldn't notice it because the scan was taken while I was laying down. This surgeon had me stand up and cough while he placed his hands on the bulge - this was proof that I had a hernia - the cat scan showed that I had no muscle remaining on the right side where the PS took the perforators. I needed open abdominal surgery (which took place a year after my so-called \"diep\") and the hernia surgeon worked with a plastic surgeon to place a biologic mesh material - they also tightened up my muscles and supported the mesh so I should never experience another hernia again. Repeat hernias are common after hernia repairs, especially with mesh that isn't biologic. The mesh they used on me was called Strattice - made by the same company that makes Alloderm. This summer will be my first summer without surgery in two years - and I'm so grateful for BC.ORG and the wonderful people here who have helped me.   I hope my info has helped you - there's a lot of info here at bc.org about hernias - just do a Search - there's an article buried here somewhere where it states that women who have had prior abdominal surgery run a 25% increase risk of hernia after a Diep.......the risk for hernia after a muscle-sparing free tram is even higher. Good luck and I hope anyone who experiences a hernia after breast reconstruction surgery can find an experienced hernia surgery as wonderful as mine (Dr. George DeNoto - North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset NY on Long Island - he works with Dr. Ron Israeli a wonderful plastic surgeon who's practice is devoted to breast reconstruction.

Are you Her2+ or BRCA positive?  There are so many new treatments today for women with bc - my own attitude about mastectomy was totally influenced by women my mother's age.......times have REALLY changed a lot since then. I hope you'll slow down a bit and think this through very carefully. Have you spoken to an oncologist yet? You sound a lot like I was back in February when I was first dx'd............I had barely a month between my dx and my surgery. I let fear totally overcome my mind - and stubborn stoicism determine my decision. I really would have been fine with a lumpectomy and radiation - but was very fearful of radiation and so chose a unilateral skin-sparing masectomy followed by an immediate Diep. Well things don't always work out for the best.  I didn't get a Diep, I got a \"muscle-sparing free tram\" - and I got something I never anticipated - a MRSA staph infection in my abdomen, which caused about 8 inches of my incision to reopen. It needed packing 2 times a day for over 3 months. Now I have a very large abdominal bulge which is really a hernia (the staph ate away most of the muscle on my right side) I need more abdominal surgery to repair this with a mesh. And the new \"foob\" isn't great to look at - it'll be OK after Stage 2 and possibly Stage 3 surgery, but it feels heavy and fake - has no sensation at all. Also my belly-button is weird and I have no feeling in my skin around that area either. Of course you may end up with a totally successful surgery without all these problems - many women do - but you'll have to do a lot of research to get a very experienced plastic surgeon. I THOUGHT I had a very experienced Diep plastic surgeon -but even so I ended up with big problems. I also ended up with stage 1 lymphedema in my right arm...........fortunately I only had one breast removed, so my left arm is still useable for blood draws and my Herceptin tx. Having both breasts removed does increase your risk for lyphedema in both arms AND in your trunk.  So why put yourself through all this if a lumpectomy and rads have the same recurrence rates as mastectomy? Back when I made my decision - I didn't know that fact - I thought mastectomy had much lower recurrence rates - but newer studies show that's not true. At least give yourself a chance to see if a lumpectomy and rads will work for you. You can always get a mastectomy later on. I wanted to do something to \"put cancer behind me\" - and instead, my huge scars are a constant reminder of what fear can do to a person, more damage than my .9 cm stage 1 tumor should have done.",

He says so many women jump into surgeries so quickly without talking to the oncologist first.

Still I've stumbled across several doctors that were just \"not that into me\". No matter how good their credentials or reputations, some doctors are still losers - here's a checklist of how to spot a BAD doctor (wish I knew this last year!): http://nosurrenderbreastcancerhelp.org/page16/page14/page14.html WARNING SIGNS OF A BAD DOCTOR: Talks to you only in the exam room while you are undressed 2. Never looks at you when you are speaking, but rather, writes furiously in your chart not listening to a word you say 3. Has not reviewed your case at all prior to your visit. You know this because while you are perched on the iron table in your paper dress waiting for him, you hear him leave the exam room of another patient, then he is standing outside your door and you hear him remove your chart from the little cubby on the front of your door, flip through a few pages for 30 seconds and then he comes in. THAT is not PREP. Either come in and open the chart and talk or review it before hand at your desk in a proper way. 4. He doesn't wash his hands upon entering. He just left another exam room- do you really want him touching you? 5. He makes no eye contact, isn't quite sure of your name and simply goes through the motions of an exam. Or worse, never touches you. Never lays hands on you but writes up five prescriptions anyway. 6. He acts as if we are all the same person- more like cars in a body shop than human. Once he opens the hood of a Chevy it is the same as a Ford. 7. He doesn't let you speak, ask questions, or express your fears 8. He doesn't seem to care that you have cancer. There is no empathy. He either tells you he can \"cure you\" or he says off hand \"we'll see if this works\" 9. When you question him about wanting a test or a certain chemo he makes a face because you \"read it on the internet\". He then proceeds to inform you that anything you read is wrong and he is the only one who is right. 10. He has the same routine with everyone, never thinks of you as an individual. You can tell from the way he is talking it is a rote speech he has delivered thousands of times. But he never puts YOU into the speech. You can tell your particular case is of no interest to him-he has done this thousands of times, he would like you to just be quiet and listen to what he has to say. 11. You express a fear about your hair falling out and he makes a joke and tells you to stop being vain. 12. He doesn't take into account the quality of your life when he is lining up one harsh treatment after another. 13. If you ask him about a side effect he says it \"goes with the territory\" 14. He makes you wait-not just in the waiting room but even in the exam room where you are left there waiting and waiting. At least in the waiting room there were magazines to read! Once in a while, and if an apology is given then it is fine, but every time with no apology is unacceptable 15. He is unavailable for after hours emergencies. OR if you finally do get through to him, he insinuates that you \"bothered\" him for nothing 16. He won't share your case and what he feels needs to be done with your other doctors. 17. He never calls you with test results. 18. He thinks you are overreacting and might need some kind of counseling, anti-depressant, tranquilizer, etc. or you have fibromyalgia-when if he took five minutes to put your mind at east you wouldn't need anything. 19. He won't let you bring your husband, brother, sister, or best friend in with you to discuss your case- all you are doing is taking up too much of his time. 20. He doesn't remember you. After six months of chemo he still has no clue who you are.... Don't wait six months to discover this. Six minutes will tell you a lot about your doctor!",

My abdominal scar has finally healed, but it remains a bright angry red, and feels like a tight band across my belly. My new \"foob\" is still too big and too flat - and my PS won't do Stage 2 until I finish my Herceptin next April. And my port scar is an ugly two inch scar - with an added \"dimple\" scar high in my neck. However - my sense of identity is tied to other people's view of me, rather than my own view of myself in a mirror. Thus I do much better when I'm engaging in conversation with people, or get busy helping people. Part of my problem is I'm just not involved enough with people outside my family - so the walls seems to close in and I get a lost feeling. Thus, I hope my feeling of \"self\" will return when I return to work in September. Still, I have lost a lot of my old zest, though I understand that this too is a process. Perhaps it has allowed me more quiet time to rethink my priorities. I haven't returned to work since my surgery back on March 3rd - and now the school is closed for summer. I stayed involved with everyone through emails, but so much time has passed, I feel disconnected from my old co-workers and my old job. I'll be returning to work in September - but it seems unreal, like it won't be the same. I'm nervous about returning and having everyone look me up-and-down and asking me a million questions. Part of me wants to quit my job and start something new - the other part is grateful that my job is waiting for me. The bottom line is - I am a changed person. For better or worse - there's no going back. But I need to stay mindful that all change is difficult. Life is nothing but change. So often I feel like a lump of rock........and the good and bad events in my life are like a river pouring over me, day after day, smoothing out my rough spots, making me harder, shinier, more resilient.......hopefully turning my rock-hard soul into a jewel that, at the end of my journey, would be bright enough to be picked up by God.",

Also - thanks to these boards, I read that not everyone needs pre-meds. When I switched oncologists after a month, my new oncologist gave me steroids and an anti-nausea medication before my chemo. It caused the most awful constipation and tummy pain! Next time I told them forget the pre-meds - I was fine with just the Navelbine and Herceptin - I'd rather deal with the diarrhea all that night than suffer for three days with constipation! I was lucky my infusion nurse was an angel and a good communicator...........we never had any problems after that.

I'm really  keeping my fingers crossed that he's right! The other good news is he told me in 48 hours I could go swimming - including my lap swimming, yay! I know the water pressure helped reduce my LE in my right arm last year - and the exercise will also help. Oh and MapleTree you're also right - that my drain was NOT really painful..........the \"pain\" was more mental in my impatience to get rid of it.........and in the annoyance of showering and dressing. The drain removal was completely pain free this time - so I hope other people won't be frightened - it is a big nuisance but a necessary one as you heal from surgery.",

I'm not happy even with this circle, it seems to flatten my breast more than it should. Since the reconstructed breast is too big, too flat, and too fat under my arm, and because of communication and other problems with my original PS, I've switched to a new PS who only specializes in breast reconstructions. He'll be doing major revisions on me - going in through the same scars, removing the flap from the chest wall, repositioning it higher, making it smaller to match my B cup natural breast on the other side and hopefully removing the circle all together. I know there's another woman on this site who had major revisions done to her bi-lat breast reconstructions by travelling to NOLA........her photos are on TimTam's photo site - her revisions took several surgeries, but her large foot-ball shape scars are gone and her breasts are beautiful! Maybe she'll post here to give you some advice. Sometimes you need to get a second opinion by another PS in order to get the results you want if your original PS doesn't have an open mind. Good luck and I hope you'll get the results you want AND deserve!",

So on Tuesday the PS put a new drain back in - immediately 350cc came out, which flattened my tummy beautifully, but now I'm stuck with this pain of a drain for who knows how long, sigh. Since Tuesday it's still outputting about 50cc every day, and the nurse told me today I'd definitely need to keep it in over the weekend and to call her Monday.Next Thursday the 13th I see my general surgeon (who did the hernia and gall bladder surgery with the PS) - I'm PRAYING the output will be zero by then and he'll remove it. We're going on vacation Saturday the 15th and I do NOT want to be stuck with this drain! It's been nearly a month since I had the surgery and I'm so so tired of everything. I do realize how lucky I am to have found such fantastic surgeons who could repair my large hernia - and I thank God I didn't end up with another mrsa staph infection........and I am sooo happy that large hernia/bulge is gone and that my incisions are healing well and my tummy is feeling less and less tight each passing day............but this YUCKY drain is getting me down and for some reason I feel more tired. I see my oncologist on Monday - I hope my blood work is OK. Does anyone know if excess blood/fluid loss because of a drain causes anemia? I can't find anything online about that.

I thought massage might help, but it did nothing but make it get larger. A cat scan showed the seroma clearly...........the radiologist who aspirated it said it's actually the beginning of a hematoma, because it was mostly blood that was removed. Fortunately it was very fluid - so that means it wasn't a true hematoma. Sorry if this is a gross subject..............I'm so so tired of problems with my stomach!",

Then on the morning of surgery the nurse took my temperature (in my ear) which registered 100.6...........yet because my lungs were clear, the anesthesiologist gave the green light to proceed. I had a 7 hour surgery (uni-lateral mx with immediate free-tram recon)......was released from the hospital after 4 days..........2 days later I was coughing my lungs out, killing my stomach and breast, and had to return to the ER because of severe congestion, shortness of breath and pain. THey admitted me and I was stuck there for 2 more weeks on IV antibiotics to fight off a MRSA staph infection which took hold in my lungs and abdomen. My abdominal muscles were desetroyed by the MRSA...........which necessitated opened abdominal surgery a year later to insert a mrsa-resistant mesh. I am only now getting my strength back. So - as you can imagine - my advice to you is fight your bronchitis now and do NOT undergo surgery until your immune system is back to peak performance. Do not risk getting a mrsa or c-diff infection (they are becoming extremely common). Check out www.hospitalinfection.org for more information on how you can protect yourself. Good luck with everything!",

The only other suggestion I have is to try to EDUCATE your husband about breast cancer. When he says you're spending too much time online - tell him you are RESEARCHING your disease. Use the word \"disease\" - I'm finding some men act like BC is nothing more serious than a bad case of acne. They have heard so many \"success\" stories - that they think \"no big deal\". Has your husband gone with you to your doctor appointments? Your doctor could sit down and explain to him your risks of recurrence should you choose to do nothing. Some doctors are afraid to spell out in dirty detail what actually happens at the end of BC..........so print out the scary scene flyrzfan posted above and show him. Also - if your doctor or nurse can give you written details about what your treatment will be - how long - the side effects - it should help you make realistic plans. I am one who really believes in planning ahead - especially on this roller-coaster ride - better to sit in the front seat with your eyes wide open to see what's coming than cower in the back!

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2009 05:36PM - edited Jun 9, 2009 05:36PM by swimangel72 Have you received your pathology report and talked to a medical oncologist? Usually your treatment plan is determined by the oncologist, not the surgeon. Also you can't assume just because you get a mastectomy that you won't need chemo - you probably won't need radiation, unless the tumor was close to your chest wall. Lumpectomy with radiation is equal in survival AND recurrence rates to mastectomy. I thought that my mastectomy would be enough (considering my tumor was \"just\" Stage 1 and Grade 2 - but later, to my dismay, learned taht I still needed chemo when the FISH report showed that the tumor was Her2+++. My advice is - do NOT make any hasty decisions - make an appointment with a medical oncologist before deciding what kind of treatment, including surgery, that you need. Be sure you understand your pathology report - and if necessary - get a second opinion from another oncologist. Good luck and let us know what you decide to do!",

Be sure your anesthesiologist talks to you before you enter the operating room.........tell him/her about any prior bad experiences with anesthesia and pain control. From all I've read here at bc.org, a mx is much more tolerable than a c-section - still you are 10 years older and fighting  BC, so your fears are normal. What helped me was doing the Lamaze breathing techniques prior to my surgery and especially during and after my sentinel lymph node blue dye injection (which I was forced to have without any pain meds or numbing cream.) Believe me - the Lamaze puffs of breath REALLY helped me not to focus on the pain! Relaxing music and visualization techniques also help........I brought a photo in of my kids and I kayaking on Lake George........the green mountains and blue water and smiles REALLY helped me! Praying the rosary for several days before my surgery also helped me - I kept reminding myself that my suffering is NOTHING compared to what others have to endure on planet earth - what Mary had to suffer. I kept reminding myself that I was STRONG - and so relieved that I'm the one going through this and not my daughters or son or DH.

After all my complications with the mrsa - my oncologist said it's unfortunate that the surgeons don't send them the patients FIRST - he would have recommended just a lumpectomy with rads for me and I could have avoided so many problems. If you need to cancel your surgery in order to make time to see a medical oncologist - do it! You should at least have a copy of your pathology report in your hand before surgery.........oh, and ask your surgeon to get a second opinion on the pathology report too. My breast cancer surgeon said he never performs surgery without a second OUTSIDE opinion on the reading - because pathology labs have made errors in the past.",

Some insurance companies won't pay for Oncotype DX in your case since it's assumed you ALREADY have a high risk for recurrence due to your Her2neu status. For more information (including the suffering of ladies with mets) go to http://www.her2support.org/. You can also watch the move Living Proof which is the inspirational story of Herceptin http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvtVC1oOPyw As you can see - I rather TRY to prevent a recurrence of BC than deal with mets down the road. Yes heart attacks are the number 1 cause of death - but once you've been dx'd with BC, especially HER2+ bc, the odds are MUCH higher that you will die from BC. Good luck with your decision.",

Your fears about chemo are not specific to the chemo regime that would be tailed for you. Not all chemo txs are the same - and not all patients experience all the worse side effects - and certainly, not all side effects are permanent or deadly. Her2+++ cancer is deadly however if you get a recurrence or mets. To get real answers to your questions - as I've said before - you should visit the www.her2support.org web site - and meet the women there who had tumors the same size and grade as yours, who weren't able to get Herceptin and who now have mets.

I too felt rushed - because I really wanted to get the cancer out. So much depends on the size of your breast tissue now.........I was a \"barely B\" and not to much in \"love\" with my breast, so I knew that a mastectomy would bring me much peace-of-mind, especially when my surgeon told me recurrence rates are MUCH lower with mastectomy than with lumpectomy/radiation. If you go for a lumpectomy you will need radiation - something that did not appeal to me, for many reasons. I felt that a mastectomy would \"get it all\" and I was willing to live with a prothesis. However, I was happily surprised to find out about the Diep reconstruction option which leaves very little scarring if done immediately after the mastectomy. So I had a unilateral skin-sparing mastectomy followed by an immediate Diep. I was home in 5 days and doing well - until I ended up back in the hospital because of a staph infection. The healing of my abdomen has been painfully slow, but I'm almost there now. If I didn't get that infection, I could have returned to work after 8 weeks.  I'm happy now that I went through it all......after my Stage 2 surgery my new \"foob\" will be hard to tell from the other \"real\" one. The decision for a lumpectomy or a mastectomy is very personal and difficult - what you need to do is look closely at your pathology report, look at what kind of recurrence rate your cancer has, and see what you're comfortable doing. Since you have a wedding in just 4 weeks, perhaps you're better off doing the lumpectomy first and see if they can get clean margins. You can always opt for a mastectomy later - especially if they don't get clean margins, or if your lymph nodes show cancer, or your Her2 status is positive, or your Oncotype DX score is high......these tests all take time, but it helps you to decide on your treatment plan. Good luck Kira - and stay in touch! We'd like to hear what you decide - AND to hear all about the wedding (did you get your gown yet?)",

And now you've reminded me that I need to send her a thankyou card too! I've also give her business card to my plastic surgeon and oncologist - they both said they have patients in the area looking for a well-qualified LE therapist. Danielle was really happy when I told her this (she's close to getting her PhD - anyone in the NYC area who needs a fantastic LE therapist can PM me.) Danielle diagnosed me with just Stage 1 lymphedema - but even so, she's been extremely thorough since I started seeing her - she totally eliminated my stubborn arm cording (which came back twice!) I have only 2 more visits with her - she's teaching me the manual massage - and even though I don't have to wrap my arm (thank goodness) Danielle ordered me a compression sleeve and gauntlet which I'm supposed to wear if I'm doing repetitive tasks or if I go flying. She even told me how to wash the sleeve so it won't get ruined (by hand, cold water, with Ivory soap - drip dry only.) She has told me over and over, it's important to catch lymphedema early and to go through all these steps so as to prevent a full-blown case from developing. Education is the key to prevention - and my LE therapist is a GREAT teacher! Thanks again Binney for all your helpful advice!",

I'm sorry you're still feeling so tired, but 5 weeks is still a bit early to feel totally back to your normal self. It's been over a year since my surgery and my energy level isn't the same - but I'm blaming it on the Herceptin I'm still getting (I'll be done next month) - and the Arimidex. Emotionally our minds are saying, \"Enough - let's get back to normal\" - but our bodies still need to heal and get stronger at their own pace. I'm sorry you are getting swelling in your stomach.........I had that too.........wearing the binder when walking helped a lot (I got the binder from my new surgeon, no thanks to my original PS who never even so much as suggested that I wear a binder to help with my obvious bulge - nor even suggested wearing a tight girdle (which helps me so much during the day.) Where is your swelling occuring exactly when you say on both sides of your abdomen? Is it right next to your incision? Be sure to complain to your PS........call if you feel it necessary........and if after a while you don't get the answers or help you want, go for another opinion. The best advice I got was from a woman here at bc.org who convinced me to get a second opinion (thanks BethNY wherever you are these days!) Sandy I'm sorry I didn't write sooner and I hope you'll be feeling more energetic soon! Pam - your dx is close to my own......my surgery was just two months after yours. I'm so sorry that you have had such disappointing complications and hope your new PS will be able to help you. I'll be finished with the Herceptin in April......my infusions were given to me every two weeks. Are you getting Arimidex? I'm post-menopausal and was happy I didn't need Tamoxifen because I read it can cause endometrial cancer. My onc said he prefers Arimidex for post-menopausal women - I do feel more achey in the joints, but nothing unbearable.  I also love to kayak........we have 3 Stearns inflatables that work very well on quiet lakes........so easy to pack and carry in the car! Can't wait to get them out in the warmer weather........thanks for mentioning the kayaking.........your advice to Sandy is so helpful to me, to keep doing the things we enjoy but not to push too hard. I need to remind myself that \"this too shall pass\" - that there are better days coming!",

My tumor was only .9cm with no node involvement - but once they told me the tumor was Her2++++ there was no choice but to get Herceptin. Her2+ tumors are VERY aggressive! Do your research and see what the recurrence rates are - and read some of the stories at www.her2support.org from the women with mets who weren't able to get Herceptin. Fortunately I was able to get a \"mild\" chemo (Navelbine every two weeks for 4 months with the Herceptin) so I didn't suffer hair loss or any additional heart risks. The Herceptin plus chemo reduces your risk of recurrence 50%.........my Oncotype DS score was 23 - which put me at a 14% risk for recurrence. The Herceptin and chemo reduced my risk to 7%. I don't like to gamble with my life - other people are more comfortable with gambling. If you are still in doubt, get a second opinion from another oncologist Good luck with everything and may God's angels watch over you!",

It was first requested back in February when my original biopsy was done. So instead of leaving, he asked me to wait in the waiting room while the FISH report got faxed to him. After about 10 minutes, the nurse came back to get me and she and the doctor had very sad expressions..........the results were positive. They were both very surprised since every other indication was that my cancer was slow growing. My doctor was so surprised (and untrusting of Quest laboratories) that he requested a second opinion on the FISH - and told me he'll call in 4 to 5 days with the results. I'm not naive enough to get my hopes up that a mistake was made on the first FISH test......but it would be nice to have a little bit of hope that I won't need to go on Herceptin and chemo.......my oncologist said he would use a low-dose chemo where I won't lose my hair, but it all depends on the results of this second opinion.

Oh - and it turns out my Oncotype DX score was 22 - not as low as I thought.) He discussed many different studies and said he believes my best course of action would be to go every two weeks for an IV infusion of Herceptin with Navelbine (a low side-effect chemo drug that shouldn't make me lose my hair.) I've been reading about navelbine and it appears the biggest problem is constipation and sometimes severe stomach pain - and sometimes low white blood cell counts. Since I still have an open incision in my abdomen, the doctor wants to consult with my surgeon as to when to start the drugs. He said it can take months for my incision to heal - but on the other hand, he doesn't want me to risk getting another infection.

      "Content": "May 19, 2008 12:32PM - edited May 19, 2008 12:34PM by swimangel72 I've HAD it with my swollen stomach! It's starting to worry me even more now that nearly 3 months have passed since my surgery. I made an appointment with my PCP for tomorrow morning - because even though my lymphedema therapist is wonderful, somehow I'm beginning to think it isn't lymphedma in my tummy, but something else. It isn't \"soft\" or \"fluid\" - it's rock hard, as though I'm 7 months pregnant. I haven't asked my PCP for his advice in any of this journey, so now's the time. While I was in the hospital, a \"hospitalist\" was in charge of my care (an internal medicine doctor) - NOT the plastic surgeon or breast surgeon - and it was because of the hospitalist that they finally did a CAT scan on my abdomen and found 3 pockets of fluid - and at his insistence, the PS aspirated some of it and that's how they found the staph infection. If I had just been under the care of my PS, I doubt very much he would have aspirated the fluid - or even acknowledged that the fluid was there. So the lightbulb went off in my head this morning that I need to involve my PCP - hopefully he'll order a CAT scan and we'll get to see what's happening in my abdomen. I'm really worried that it could be a hernia or a hematoma or seroma. At least this way I'll get another opinion before I see my PS on Thursday. The good news is that my abdominal incision is really closing up now. If it turns out to be \"only\" lymphedema in my abdomen, then I'll feel more relaxed - especially if I get the OK to go swimming again. Even if I have to wait another month or two, at least I'll know it's nothing more serious. Sigh.......I'm just so tired of looking AND feeling like I'm 7 months pregnant!",

Your dx is similar to mine - except I am Her2+++.......do you know what your Her2 status is? I had decided to get a mastectomy and Diep recon even before knowing my Her2 status. Still it was a shock to learn that I'd need chemo and Herceptin - I thought by going the radical route of mastectomy I could avoid chemo. I agree with the other women who have advised you to seek out the genetic testing. If you end up BRCA1 or 2 positive, then it may give you more confidence moving ahead with a bi-lat and recon. However, if you're negative - and you're Her2-, you may wish to take a less radical approach and go for the lumpectomy and rads. The mastectomy and recon surgery is difficult.............you can end up with many complications you never envisioned. Besides the MRSA staph infection which destroyed my abdominal muscles (and now I need more surgery to repair the big bulge) - I am saddened that I have lost sensation in the skin from my abdominal incision, up past my navel and to my chest bone. I also have no feeling in my new foob so I'm glad that I kept the other breast. I know how scary the shock of a dx first is - how quickly we can c ome to a decision - but it's ok to change your mind. Yes it is a very personal decision - but don't rush; take your time - get a second and even a third opinion before you move forward. And good luck with everything - I'm sorry you've joined us on this roller-coaster ride.",

My cancer was even smaller than  yours - everyone kept saying it \"wasn't that serious\".........even after MRI's of both breasts showed no other cancers, my doctor was so thorough he ordered MRI's of both my hips since I complained about hip pain (turned out to be arthritis) - and he even gave me a complete bone scan. Because I am who I am (jumping into the ocean all at once, riding the front seat of the roller-coaster type of person) I opted for a skin-sparing mastectomy followed immediately by Diep (because I saw my dad die of brain cancer at the age of 59). I'm glad I did the mastectomy (not saying YOU should be so aggressive) - because my Her2 status took a LONG time to come back - and when it did (just last week) it turns out I'm positive. So I'm happy my breast doctor was as aggressive as I was all along. My oncologist is just as aggressive - and I'll be starting on chemo and Herceptin soon. Bottom line - get a second opinion - and I hope they agree that you need MRI's done on both breasts.

The physical battle against the beast of BC can be won .............oftentimes it's the emotional wounds that take longer to heal. Try to maintain your own life Nicole - are you able to get out with your friends at all?

So - no - I didn't \"negotiate\" with him at all.....he's an amazing man, very intelligent - has done many studies of his own - and came highly recommended. He discussed with me all the recent studies done with Herceptin and their outcomes and said he didn't like some of the chemo drugs used in conjunction with Herceptin because they aggravated the heart problems and that since I was Stage 1, Grade 1, I didn't need such strong meds.  He decided to use Navelbine because a recent study showed that Herceptin worked well in node-negative Stage 1, Grade 1 patients like me, as long as it was given with ANY chemo drug - not alone. I didn't get an \"official\" second opinion -  however, a friend of my husband's is a doctor who's SISTER is the head of oncology at a major hospital in California. I emailed her my entire sob story and she wrote back and said my onc is right on target with everything and I should feel very comfortable moving forward with this treatment. Sometimes I do feel nervous though since I don't know any other women on Herceptin and Navelbine who are early stagers like me.....most women on this regime have mets...........but, I realize everyone's cancer (and family history) is very different and ultimately it comes down to trusting your onc. Kim if you're not satisfied with the treatment suggestions from your onc, be sure you go for a second (and even third) opinion. It'll put your mind at rest.  Oh and how goofy am I? I can't stop hearing the Mary Poppins song \"Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down\"........wouldn't we all love a magical Mary Poppins-nurse when we get our chemo tx - with rosy cheeks and no warts too!  No matter what happens Kim - remember - chemo isn't forever - you can get through it - all the women here are like Mary Poppins for me!",

I had an opened abdominal incision after my free-tram and it had to heal from inside-out, which meant packing it twice a day for 4 months. Infections ARE avoidable - even with implant surgery.

I stayed in the hospital from Monday through Friday - and went home with three drainage tubes and pain pills. I had to be readmitted the following Sunday due to shortness of breath - and they kept me there another 11 days due to a shaph infection in my abdomen. I was then sent home with an open abdominal incision (which is finally beginning to close) and more antibiotics. I'm still not permitted to return to work - my surgeon put me back on MORE antibiotics (because now my port scar is infected.) So much depends on how your surgery proceeds - what kind of reconstruction surgery are you anticipating? Are you planning on implants or a free-Tram or Diep? I chose the Diep because it would come the closest to matching my healthy breast and I didn't want any problems with my muscles. Also I didn't want an implant under my chest-wall muscles since I'm a swimmer. Complications like mine can occur even with very minimal surgery, so please don't let me get you too worried! You are MUCH younger than me.......and if you have a strong immune system you should be fine no matter what surgery you choose, as long as your surgeons are very experienced.

And thanks for suggesting the sick bank to me - but support personnel in my district can't use a sick bank according to our union. It's really not a problem right now for me - but next year I hope to be a union rep for the technical department and you can be sure I'll try to fight to get a sick bank included in our benefits. Lauren I too had to wait so long before my first tx.....2 hours in the waiting room - but having a good book to read really helped! My biggest complaint is that the drive to my oncologist's office is 40 minutes away. I'm sorely tempted to check out the new little cancer center building only a mile away from my house. I do trust, respect and LOVE my oncologist - but the idea of driving back and forth every two weeks for a year is a big turn-off, especially considering that price of gasoline - can you BELIEVE it's nearly $4 a gallon!! Also, my dh has to either take a day off from work, or work at home so he can drive me. Has anyone else switched oncologist just for the convenience factor? I'm sure my oncologist will understand - but I'm also afraid of switching because I do really like the nurse practitioner there who does the infusions so expertly......and I've been feeling well after my first treatment so maybe I shouldn't rock the boat so soon? Anyone have any advice?? P.S.  Sorry ladies - I seem to have missed some posts - this happens to me alot when I read the new threads - I THINK I'm responding right behind you, then suddenly there are a bunch of new posts that I didn't even see!

Then the reverse problem started - so hang in there and I hope you're feeling better soon. \"April is the cruellest month\" goes through the literary part of my brain - but it's a gorgeous day here so I should get off my butt (away from the computer which is my refuge these days) and go out and water my plants!)

GOod luck with all your decisions - may God's angels quide you and protect you!",

I sat for two hours in the waiting room, but found a great book to read there! Then I sat in the lounge chair for another two and a half hours. This is certainly a lesson in patience - for both me and my dh! They told me I won't be losing my hair but it may get thinner. Next week I get my port installed - todays infusion was through an IV in my hand, and my vein didn't hurt at all, but they won't chance it a second time. Other than being a bit tired (I blame it on my lack of sleep last night) - I'm feeling fine tonight.......so far, so good, keeping my fingers crossed - drinking a LOT of water -  and trying to catch up with everyone's posts here to get to know my April sisters better.",

I actually have to tell myself to get off the computer (I'll end up with carpal tunnel syndrome soon!) and then zone out in front of the TV. The other alternative entertainment is doing the laundry......life is so unexciting these days for me. Now it looks like I won't be going to my cousin's son's wedding on Saturday - it's a two and a half hour drive and I can't imagine sitting that long in the car with my stupid, slow-healing abdominal incision. That plus the fear I have that I'll feel lousy after they put in my port on Wednesday - plus the fact that I look like I'm 6 months pregnant, nothing fits me, my hair is awful - I just don't feel in the party mood at all, so I'll be calling my cousin today to cancel. P.S.  DUH! Did it again - posted a reply to a MUCH earlier thread - why do I ALWAYS keep missing the newer threads?? P.P.S  My Nottingham Prognostic Index is very low, but it doesn't appear to assign any points to someone who is Her2+.....anyway, there is an emotional toll these tools can dump on us, sometimes I think my mother is right, \"ignorance is bliss.\"",

I also saw my PS today - he remarked how much my swollen stomach looks better but still said I should stay home another week from work (which I'm not objecting to at all, especially with my neck hurting me and the steri-strips on my port incision.) Also I get my second chemo infusion next Wednesday - I'll feel better returning to work knowing how I feel after that. I really feel very whimpy compared to what all you other ladies are going through, especially with the hair loss.

At 10:30 am he calls and says he needs a trip to the hospital. Another boy's head crashed into my son's prescription goggles and he got a huge gash on the top of his cheekbone, just under his eye. Thank God his eye was OK. So I made up my mind to take him to one particular hospital near the school, but we were detoured by a Veteran's Day parade - and ended up on the highway driving back to the hospital where I got the MRSA staph in my abdomen. I felt extremely nervous going back in there - but we had no choice. As soon as we entered the ER, I made my son wash his hands with the santizer dispenser - and I did my own too. Thank God it all turned out very well - the ER nurses and doctors were fantastic! We didn't wait at all...........and we were fortunate that a plastic surgeon was available - he stitched him up beautifully and said he should only have a very slight scar. So I told my son - even though I was afraid to return to that hospital - I think God's angels sent us on that detour - who knows if the other hospital would have had a plastic surgeon available when we got there? I really am not a nervous-nilly type in hospitals. Usually I'm fascinated by all the equipment - but when it's your son - and when it's a hospital you had a bad experience in - a person's heart beat can sound REALLY loud in their own ears! I'm so glad today is over............all's well that ends well............my job is to keep reminding my son to keep his hands clean and AWAY from his face while his wound heals.",

Binney yes I have been a swimmer for most of my life - used to swim on an adult team but have slowed down considerably after having kids. Still, even while pregnant, I used to swim a mile a day. I swam a half mile the day before my surgery knowing I'd be out of the water for a long time. Grace - I can't wait to get back into the pool - I just KNOW it'll make a world of difference in all my swollen areas. My arm isn't that noticeable as of now - and hopefully it won't get worse. The swelling in my new Diep breast and abdomen is annoying - but again I'm trying to stay positive that they will improve with time, especially with therapy. Thanks so much for the advice about the LE garments...I really need to google them and see what might fit and help my breast area. I can't wear anything tight on my abdomen right now until it finishes healing. And you are so right about the surgeons.....they seem to just look at the incisions or at the new breast. Even the other doctors comment in a negative way about the surgeons - how they don't get the \"whole picture\" (mine is a very sweet kind man, but he was in denial about the location of my abdominal staph infection until he was proven wrong.) Sue and Debbie - the weight gain is always a worry - I do have a fibroid in my uterus that doesn't cause any bleeding, but sometimes I wish I had my own portable MRI machine - or X-ray vision - to SEE inside there to be sure it isn't growing since it was checked last time! WHERE or WHERE is Dr. McCoy from Star Trek? Remember how he'd call our 20th century doctors \"butchers\"? Or maybe you are all too young to remember that show with Capt. James T.

It returned positive as well, so to my great dismay I had to start on chemo. The good news is that Herceptin really works so well against Her2+ tumors and the side effects are very light. So even though it's unusual to be Her2+ with Stage 1 and Grade 1, it's not impossible. Be sure you get a follow-up report on your Fish results!",

While I didn't buy into HIS egotistical logic, I knew I didn't want rads and knew that for my own peace-of-mind a mastectomy made sense. I opted for a skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with a Diep flap - unfortunately this turned into a muscle-sparing free tram, which would have been fine, except I then developed a MRSA staph infection in my abdomen which meant another 2 weeks in the hospital on IV drugs - then home with an opened, debrided abdominal incision that needed packing for 3 months. Later on, I realized that my surgeon didn't give me the correct facts - that recurrence of cancer is equal with lump/rads or mastectomy. This is an important scientific fact - RECURRENCE RATES ARE THE SAME (new studies prove this.) So now I wish that I just went with the lump/rads. I also erroneously thought that a mastectomy would mean I wouldn't need chemo - WRONG! I never saw an oncologist until after my surgery - another big mistake on my part. The surgeon and plastic surgeon had rushed me into surgery so fast my head was spinning! And it fed my fear to \"get it out\". I should have slowed down and spent more time researching. Turns out that my tumor was Her2+ and my Oncotype DX score was 22 - in the low end of the intermediate stage. Thus my onc said I needed Herceptin and chemo anyway - and more surgery to implant a port -which also got infected and had to be removed - needless to say, I'm NEVER returning to that hospital! The good news is that at least I didn't need radiation - and my new foob \"took\" even if I still have major surgery down the road to repair my huge abdominal hernia. I've since switched plastic surgeons to one who is truly an artist and will make this fat foob look like a real breast. Through all this I've never regretted keeping my \"good girl\". For years it has never shown even the slightest sign of problems, not even calcifications. My \"bad girl\" always had calcifications - even at my very first mammo when I was just 37. Now my question is \"Why didn't my old radiologists and ob/gyn ever TELL me that my breast had calcifications and that I should keep a close eye on it?\" They never said ANYTHING to me - just \"everything's normal, come back next year.\" So I skipped 3 years worth of mammo's while we were moving and I was getting my daughters off to college. If I knew that calcifications were something to keep a watchful eye on, I would have been more vigilant. ANYWAY - I'm happy I still have my \"good\" breast. No matter that it's small and a bit saggy - it FEELS alive and my new foob doesn't. That's one thing that's often not discussed - how after a mastectomy the nerves are cut and your breast (including the skin) feels \"dead\". Oh - and how the area around my navel also feels dead after the free-tram. If I ever get breast cancer in my good girl, I'm not going to reconstruct that side. I've had enough surgery and infections to last the rest of my life!",

There seems to be a LOT of teachers here at bc.org with breast cancer - and my goodness, I am soooo impressed with all of you who can balance teaching with breast cancer and chemo! So many of the teachers in my school have been wonderfully supportive to me, including my principal who is a 7 year survivor. I just found out today from my PS that I can not return to work this coming Monday after all (that would be 8 weeks since my surgery) - because my abdominal incision is still open and he won't risk me getting any germs at school. Now I don't worry about germs at school - since I started work there, I've been healthy as a horse, not so much as a sniffle (but then again, I keep my computer lab really clean - all 24 computers, keyboards and mice!) Still I have to go by doctor's orders, so I will be off the payroll now since I used up all my sick-days. It's ok - my salary has been just to help pay the college tuition - and I'm hoping to return to work at least by the middle of May. I'm blessed that my DH has been steadily employed for many years. I wonder if the scientists have looked at the breast cancer risks of different jobs? That would be an interesting study - like, what's the risk of getting BC if you're a teacher - or a nurse - or a doctor - or a secretary, etc et. - but I suppose the variables of location would make that an impossible task. Sorry to ramble - I'm known for that - and I hope everyone has a quiet, restful, healing night tonight!",

My own chemo has had ups and downs........after switching oncs, I didn't realize they ADDED drugs to my Navelbine and Herceptin regime - specifically, Zofran and Decadron. The former (an anti-nausea med) caused me terrible constipation and 3 days later awful stomach cramping - and the latter (a steroid) prevented me from sleeping for 2 nights in a row. Also - they had to remove my mediport because the infection never did heal, so my infusions have been going into my veins. My arm was so painful the first week..........I ended up back on pain meds. But let me say I LOVE my new nurses........last Wednesday, at my request, they took me off the Zofran and Decadron (because the chemo never made me nauseous before) - and then instead of flushing my vein with a bag of saline before the Navelbine, they ran both through my veins at the same time. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! My arm felt fine - I had no constipation or stomach cramping - no more sleepness nights!  I was back to the manageable SEs I had gotten accustomed to at my first onc's office (painless diarhea for about 5 hours after treatment - some tiredness, some hair thinning and fingernails splitting.) I have only two more infusions of Navelbine - then it's just Herceptin every two weeks till next April - and Arimidex for five years. I'm not looking forward to getting any joint pains because I already have arthritis in my hips. I had minor hot flashes when I went through menopause so maybe it won't be too bad for me on the AI. I'm going to try to stay positive and try to keep swimming as much as I can - and try to lose weight. My goal is 25 pounds before next summer when my PS says he can do my revision surgery. I scheduled an appointment with a spine doctor - because the MRI on my lower back showed spinal stenosis and a herniated disc which may be causing the hip pain (it's so bad somedays I feel like a crippled old woman). This way I can start on physical therapy if necessary BEFORE starting on Arimidex. Also, my thyroid levels have dropped - I'm scheduled for a sonogram of my thryoid tomorrow - hopefully I won't need to go on even more meds. I'm looking forward to returning to work when school starts in September - but I'm nervous because I don't want to be the new \"poster child\" for BC......my co-workers are all wonderful, but I get embarassed by the extra attention. They haven't seen me since my surgery in March and inevitably they'll be looking me up and down to see if I changed. But the show must go on.........and so must I. Otter I hope your hair will start growing back soon - I'll be interested in reading about your experience with Arimidex and yours too Nancy. Some of the stories I've read are awful......but since my tumor was ER+ at 90%, I hope the SEs aren't too bad.",

Gina I just had my final reconstruction on Monday and I was also extremely nervous. I suppose the thought of anesthesia and infections never leave our minds..........but I'm happy to report that I woke up in the recovery room without any nauseousness, and very little pain. A bit of a twinge where they put in the drain, but otherwise, nada! Extra-strength Tylenol was all I needed after the first night..........and I think to myself, but of course, all my nerve endings were removed during the mastectomy! You could put ice on my foob and I wouldn't feel it similar to Mrs. Doubtfire, lol. I'm not allowed to get my bandages wet - my sweet plastic surgeon will perform my \"unveiling\" this coming Friday - so I'm looking forward to seeing the fipple and areola. It's been a long long journey, but I've been blessed with a wonderful supportive DH who makes me laugh every day - fantastic kids - and a job I love (with women there who have been through worse cancers than myself). I never joined a support group other than bc.org - like you Gina, I felt a bit guilty that my BC was \"only\" a Stage 1. Still I hope to convey messages of optimism and caution with my writings here - especially with surgeries that put all of us at risk for mrsa. Once again, everyone please check out www.hospitalinfection.org to better prepare yourself to avoid mrsa or c-diff. I will never ever again take hospitalization or surgeries lightly........no matter for what reason! I was a wreck when one of our teachers' needed surgery to repair his hip.......at the same hospital where I got mrsa............thank God he came through with flying colors! Now - I must admit - my worst pain these days is no longer my hip (that cortisone shot REALLY did the trick!) It's my upper neck.........and I know why it bothers me so much..........because I spend way too much time writing on my computer, lol! Have a wonderful day my sweet sisters! ",

I too loved my oncologist - he had a wonderful, warm bedside manner - but his nurse practitioner was very offensive..........downright rude........and dismissive to me. His waiting room was awful - the normal wait was 90 minutes to 2 hours.  It got so bad I switched oncologists - and now I'm happy to report that the new nurses are absolutely wonderful (maybe the honeymoon isn't over yet, but I never got a \"honeymoon\" at my old onc's office.) My new onc doesn't have the warm personality of my old onc, but on the other hand, he has performed more tests for me and seems to manage his office better - also it's only 2 miles down the road from my house, so I'm saving gallons of gasoline!  It was important to me to find an onc's office I liked because I go for treatments every two weeks - and this will continue until April of next year. Of course, not everyone is able to switch onc's - so my advice is to call your oncologist any time you are treated poorly - it's important they get the feedback from their patients! Edited to add:  TT - I read in another thread you're a graduate from Dobbs Ferry - and now I got shivers up my back thinking you're going to my OLD oncologist's office in White Plains! I'm sending you a PM to tell you his name (I don't want to start a smear campaign against this lovely man just because his nurse practitioner is so snippy!)",

No one told me I had MSRA until I started complaining to the insurance company nurse (who called me every two weeks with an angel's voice!) She was worried about me and checked her files on me and lo-and-behold SHE was the first person to tell me I had contracted MRSA!  No thanks to ANY of the doctors or nurses! Of course they try to keep a low-profile about MRSA in the hospital (afraid of law-suits and bad press). I immediately went to the Records department at the hospital and got copies of all my hospital reports - there it was, spelled out in black and white - and all the notes from the specialists, including an infectious disease specialist. It wasn't until a year later this past May, when I was going for Stage 2 free-tram revisions, that my NEW plastic surgeon advised me to get checked again for MRSA with their infectious disease specialist. He had to swab my nose, underarms and groin - I was SHOCKED to learn that MRSA was cultivated (meaning alive but dormant) in my nostrils! I had to apply an antibiotic ointment twice-a-day in that area for 10 days, then get rechecked (it was then negative, thank God) before my PS would perform surgery. I was VERY angry that neither my breast surgeon nor old PS recommended that I get rechecked for MRSA............I was walking around with it in my nostrils for a YEAR! Don't these doctors have ANY conscience at all? Oh - and btw - vancomyacin isn't the only antibiotic they use - when they tried to give it to my prophylactically before my abdominal hernia repair surgery on July 10th, I immediately got a rash on my arm and the nurse stopped the IV and they switched me to ZYVOX which is very effective, but very expensive. Anyway Millie - try to get copies of all your operative/hospital reports. It's good to keep a file at home, especially if you ever need to go for a second opinion - or just to act as an advocate for yourself (which is so important in today's world of rush-rush medicine). Good luck and I hope you continue healing well! ited to add:  To understand WHY I get so angry about hospital-acquired infections please check out http://www.hospitalinfection.org/. Their 15 steps to protect yourself from infection is very helpful.",

My old school is on Castle Hill Avenue - St. Raymond's - what a gorgeous church! My mom got married there about 50 years ago - and I was a brides-maid there for two of my high school girl-friends. My family moved to northern NYS many years ago - but I still get the news about my old high school. I am very impressed with your maturity and how you are helping your mom - and how close and loving your family is. And I TOTALLY understand about the unnnecessary stressful phone calls - my husband's family is like that. When he had knee surgery, the phone was so busy, I was frustrated - but he comes from a very close and loving Italian family so with the blessings come the frustrations. Hang in there sweetie - and I'll be praying for your mom to have an easy surgery! Let us know what the final pathology report says - many women on this site are very expert at reading the reports! P.S. Nicole you put tears in MY eyes with everything you've written so far - just want to send you a cyber-hug!",

Did she already start chemo and does it include Herceptin? I had a skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate recon lke your mom is thinking about - the \"added bonus of a tummy tuck\" really enticed me, but unfortunately, I ended up with a staph infection in my abdomen and now look like I'm 8 months pregnant due to the hernia that developed. I'm not trying to get you more worried Nicole - I just hope you can help your mom do the research to choose a VERY experienced plastic surgeon who has done HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS of these surgeries. There are many choices to make, even with the tummy fat - will your mom get a Diep flap (where they only remove the fat and no abdominal muscle) or a \"free-tram\" where they remove a small piece of muscle to help the veins survive - or a pedicle tram - where they remove the fat but leave it attached to the stomach muscle and tunnel it upwards through the abdominal cavity to create a new breast? I hope she can get the Diep - it really causes the least amount of problems with the stomach muscles afterwards. Here's a helpful web page my new plastic surgeon on Long Island developed: www.breastreconstruction.org Oh and there's another very experienced Diep surgeon in Manhattan at Beth Israel Hospital - his name is Mark Smith. Several women here have used him and have been happy. You could also go to the Breast Reconstruction forum and search for information there. Good luck - I'll be praying for your mom!",

Has anyone else had a problem with their port scar healing well? I'm so down about this - now that my abdominal incision is almost finished healing (took about 4months!) the thought of another wound problem is so discouraging. I know I shouldn't complain compared to what some of you are going through - but I am NOT looking forward to the summer - what with the chemo, the wounds, my bloated stomach, thinning hair.....somehow I seriously doubt I'll get back into a swimming pool this summer - never mind the beach.

I've been a lap swimmer for over 30 years so after my surgery and long recovery I couldn't wait to get back in the water. My LE therpaist did some research and was happy to report that the water is very helpful - it's like a total body massage and really helps the lymph fluid flow. My only complaint is that the chlorine is often too strong at the club where I swim and my skin gets very dry. I haven't been in the pool for over 2 weeks now due to a cough and tiredness that just won't quit. I see my onc tomorrow and hopefully he'll give me an antibiotic. Swimming is such excellent exercise for your entire body - and water aerobics is much harder than it looks! Only wish I could lose weight - it'll happen once I get back to Weight Watchers and increase my time in the pool. Vivo I much prefer swimming in an outdoor heated pool, or in a lake, but I can't stand cold water so for my lap swimming I always use an indoor pool.",

It was installed in the hospital during an out-patient procedure by an interventional radiologist (whom I never met - I had no consultation concerning different ports, locations or anything. I've never had any follow-up with him at all - only my onc and PS have been checking on it.) The port was implanted into my chest with the catheter going up, over my collarbone, into my neck, about 5 weeks ago. It took about 3 weeks for the pain in my neck to disappear. The surgical glue they used irritated my skin - as did the steri-strips. I had my second infusion through this port a week after it was installed - and after that, the incision opened and oozed - prompting my PS to put me on 10 days of antibiotics. My 3rd and 4th infusions had to be done through a vein in my hand - NOT a good thing because I'm on Navelbine for four months, which is very dangerous to your veins. Unfortunately, the port still appears infected - and my PS won't put me back on antibiotics. They want to wait to let it heal itself with just Bacitracin ointment. I believe I see the incision looking a little more closed - but now it's hurting me - sigh - and I get down thinking by the time this stupid thing is healed, I'll be finished with the Navelbine! All the time I told my onc that I didn't want a port - but they said it was very important not to burn my veins. Once again I feel like I'm taking 10 steps forward, then 20 steps backwards!",

That's why he then ordered a SECOND FISH test done at a separate laboratory (not sure though if their testing methods differed) - but the results of the second FISH test came in with an even higher score of Her2+ (it was a 4.5 score I believe) which then pushed my onc into changing his recommendation..........however, he didn't go with the usual protocol of the taxols or adriamyacin with Herceptin - he gave me a \"light\" chemo - Navelbine for 4 months with Herceptin continuing for a year.

I'm just so bummed that it still hasn't healed - I do NOT want another infusion of the Navelbine in my arm......last time, my arm felt weak and pained - I needed meds to get to sleep. Chronic irritation sounds about right - my abdomen is almost healed now, but there are bumps and red spots where I just know a suture is trying to force it's way out. They used surgical glue on my port incision and it hurt like heck for about 4 days.....also the glue from the steri-strips hurt so much too until my PS removed them. So maybe my body is just rejected everything in that area.....it's right above my good natural breast which is not very large (a \"barely B\"). A wound specialist may very well be in my future - thanks for the suggestion Otter and I hope you're feeling well! Thanks Shannon for sharing your experience......I'd be interested in hearing your theory about why your port incision didn't heal well if you have the time to write it. The good news is that I'm truly feeling sooo much stronger and more energetic! I can't WAIT for my PS to give me the green light to get back to swimming!",

Perhaps that's the normal protocol for implant reconstruction, I don't know, but  I wish my PS did put me on antibiotics - I ended up with a MRSA staph infection in my abdomen! I had been very clean at home - but it was too late; I got the infection either during my 7 hour surgery or afterwards during my 5 day stay at the hospital. So you are being very vigilant about cleaning your laundry - but be MORE vigilant during your hospital stay. Tell anyone who comes in your room to visit you that they need to wash their hands; most hospital rooms have antibacterial hand wash at the door to the rooms - don't be shy - you should even remind your doctors and nurses to wash their hands. Other women have taken antibacterial wipes and/or wipes with Bleach to wipe down things in their hospital room, including the railings, doorknobs, etc. Here's a copy of a recent article in AARP regarding MRSA and C. difficile: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ THE VILLAIN: MRSA Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can live harmlessly on the skin. But when it gets into the body, it can wreak havoc, causing fever, chills, and a full-body rash, among other symptoms. In healthy people, a properly treated infection is usually confined to the skin around a cut or a scrape. Those who have weakened immune systems or are recovering from illness should take extra precautions, however. Best Defense * Wash up Keep hands scrupulously clean (see sidebar for tips). If you're in the hospital, ask visitors and docs to wash their hands when they enter the room. * Bring your own snips Shared facilities are high-risk MRSA environments. Tote your own tools to manicure appointments, and wear flip-flops in the gym shower. And pack two towels-one for machines and a second to dry off with. * Don't pick Wash cuts and scrapes well; cover them until they're fully healed. Call the doc if... your skin develops pus-filled pimples or boils. MRSA is resistant to penicillin and certain other antibiotics but can be treated with other drugs.  Hand Washing 101 What they didn't terach you in kindergarten 1. Use warm water Excessively hot water is hard on your skin, and cold water inhibits the sudsing of soap. 2. Don't sweat the soap You don't need to kill germs with pricey antibacterial soap. Just dislodge them with a good lather. 3. Hit the hot spots Soap up every millimeter of skin, including the thumbs, the backs of the hands, and the undersides of nails. 4. Rinse repeatedly Use running water, and lots of it, to remove every last trace of suds (and germs). 5. Save your work Faucet taps can be loaded with germs. Use a paper towel to shut off the water. THE VILLAIN: C. difficile The Clostridium difficile bacterium strikes at the gut, triggering severe diarrhea. It lives harmlessly in many people's intestines, held in check by other bacteria, says Patricia Raymond, M.D., an assistant professor of clinical medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School. \"When strong antibiotics wipe out what we call these \u2018friendly flora,' C. difficile can proliferate.\" Best Defense * Keep clean Frequent hand washing helps. And if you're bed-bound in the hospital, keep a hand-sanitizing gel nearby for your own and others' use. * Don't be pill hungry Antibiotics can be lifesavers for those who need them. But if your doctor says they probably won't help you, don't insist on a prescription. * Add friendly flora If you do need an antibiotic, ask your doc about a probiotic, helpful yeast called Saccharomyces boulardii (commonly sold under the brand name Florastor). Call the doc if...you develop diarrhea that lasts longer than 24 hours or is accompanied by weakness, a racing heart rate, or blood in the stool. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here's a link to another AARP article written by a doctor on how to avoid infections in healthcare settings: http://bulletin.aarp.org/yourhealth/healthyliving/articles/finding_your_way_2.html",

Another reason for me to get everything taken out. My brother and mother are worried for me though - they think I should just have all this done laproscopically - but I'll see what the gyno/oncologist recommends. I certainly don't want to risk another staph infection...........but I must have open abdominal surgery anyway to repair the hernia, and 2 other doctors said this is the way to go. I don't even know if they CAN do laproscopic surgery on me after my free-tram.........my stomach is still very tight and my original PS said it would make it difficult for the surgeon since my stomach isn't \"normal\" now. Maybe I'll post that question in another forum - someone on this board might have had a laproscopic surgery after their free-tram or Diep, do you think??",

He did seem concerned that I didn't have any Pet scans or tumor marker tests done yet - nor that my old onc didn't do blood work on my \"off\" week to see how low my counts would go - but he said he'll do all that for me once we start. So tomorrow is my last infusion at my old onc's - at which time I'll get my dosage reports and say goodbye.

Funny how once we feel better, we can \"forget\" all the horrors we suffered (much like childbirth)! So that I will never forget (and for the new onc's information) I typed up every thing that happened to me since my dx - it was 6 pages long! The new onc really liked having this written history (as well as copies of all my reports) - and it helps me to visualize the progress I've made in my \"transformation\". I still have a long way to go, but I do see the light at the end of the tunnel. This is funny - while I was showing my new onc my abdominal incision, he asked me \"do you see daylight\" and for some weird reason I thought he meant do I see \"daylight shining through my scar\"? So I started looking down at my scar again, thinking \"Daylight? Daylight? Do I see daylight?\" as though I could see THROUGH my own stomach out my back........then, duh! I finally GOT what he meant, and said, \"OH! You mean, can I see daylight at the end of the TUNNEL! Yes - I DO see daylight, finally!\" How silly is that?! Lol!",

      "Content": "swimangel72 wrote: I've been a bit anxious lately because after going over my old scans from February I realized that in addition to a large fibroid they found a larger-than-normal endometrium (at the top of the \"normal\" range) and small cysts on my ovaries. These will need surveillance every year since I'm post-menopausal. None of my doctors ever talked about these things - so I decided to ask my PS - while he's reopening my abdominal incision (because it needs a mesh repair) can I have a hysterectomy and oopherectomy done at the same time? He said yes - AND he said he'd also remove my gall bladder (which has a large stone.) A general surgeon told me the same thing - that yes, they can do all these surgeries at once, but first I have to get an appointment with an gynecological oncologist to get his opinion. I called his office but the secretary said they won't even schedule an appointment for me until I send them all my scan reports (which I did on Friday.) Hopefully I'll hear from his office next week and get in to see him soon. I'm nervous about all this surgery - because I'm so afraid of getting another MRSA staph infection. However, it just makes total sense to me to get it all over with at once - so I never have to think about abdominal surgery again. I'm hoping the surgery can wait until next summer so I won't lose time off from work (I work in a school) - but that depends on the surgeons' schedules - and if my abdominal bulge grows - and if I end up with a gall bladder attack (keeping my fingers crossed that I don't!) I'm also hoping that the PS will be able to reshape my foob at the same time - but that may be expecting too much in one surgery. Has anyone ever had to face so many surgeries at one time? I think I'll be OK under anesthesia - my free-tram took 7 hours - I can't imagine this surgery taking that long since micro-surgery won't be involved. I'll be relieved to get the uterus and ovaries out...........I'm so afraid of any other cancers!
