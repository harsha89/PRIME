Please check if there is something like that at your cancer place. To be asked over the phone which option you want is barbaric !! My surgeon explained which was best for me, then BC nurse went over every aspect of the operation. This is as it should be. You say other people have seen different people ask them how they did that. You really shouldn't have to tho as it should all be quite smooth and flowing for you. Don't worry about the percentage bit, that is honestly the least of your worries. Just concentrate on getting better. Go online and see if there is a support network local to you and ask them for help. We are all here too. ((((  HUGS ))))",

If chemo I have short spikey hair, it must be much worse if you have a decent head of hair. My BC pal Bel lost all her hair. Today she was sitting in the back of our car with the sun shining on her lovely blond curls and her complaining that it needs a trim. It grew back so fast too.Thanks for the tip about lymph node removal arm.The scarf thing can look rather glam, one friend used to turn heads when we went into a restaurant with her, she had on a little makeup, lipstick, scarf to match her outfit and really gorgeous earrings. Stunning was the only way to describe her, you flaunt it girl, you are beautiful and don't you forget it.  Bonnets, let us know how it goes with radiologist. Keep on healing everyone.",

These ladies are soooo right, remember how ill you were last time and then when you got help everything changed ? Bra in bed a definite, support needed day and night. I have a softer one for bed. I had my pathology report yesterday. BC all out with the lumpectomy tumour almost twice as big as had been thought, lymph nodes clear:-)Radiotherapy starts in four to six weeks, also chemo, this was a bit of a shock but it is my insurance policy for my future. Before he spoke I had little pains in a lot of places, sure it had spread everywhere. When he had spoken every pain vanished, happy dance in carpark with DH and my beautiful eldest daughter. Earlier as he removed steri strips he said my breast looked swollen, thought that was normal I replied. It was a bit warm and quite firm with the odd shooting pain. No he says lots of fluid in there ! He is handed a syringe that would have given Diamond a fright. Then with no pain or discomfort he removes that much liquid that DH and ED almost fell off their chairs  ! Hope yours isn't an infection and maybe just worse version of mine, if it is the relief is amazing. Now bra fits better must have gone down a few cup sizes. We all want to be back as we were but invest a few months in yourself. No chucking heavy things about. I don't lift anything heavy, do my exercises and I still had this. As for what people say what is the matter with them? Think it is opening mouth before putting brain in gear syndrome. We went out to celebrate last night for a meal with dear friends. She gazes at me, how will you feel when all your hair comes out ? she says, silence at table.\" For the first time she will have less hair than me\" says DH with tears in his eyes, then realised he has taken all this far worse than me and was trying to make me laugh, it worked, horrible moment over and gone.There will always be someone who does this to you. Many years ago when I was diagnosed with Diabetes someone said \" oh my nan had that, she went blind and lost both her legs \" that really cheered me up !  Happy Friday Gorgeous Girls. Dragging DH around the shops today, McDonalds Lattes ( love them ) and going to look at gorgeous scarves.  Hugs to you all and Benny ring the Doctor or I will fly over and take you there.

I am a bit of a baby and will contact the experts if I don't like what is happening. Touch wood not very often at the moment. Only SE so far is bit of upset   tummy meaning lots of visits to toilet, makes me dread leaving the house a bit but make sure near loo if I do. Healing vibes to all of you. Edith",

The look on Dh face with that story was priceless, almost as good as when he came into the hairdressers yesterday afternoon to collect me and I had almost no hair!! My beautiful stylist took it all down to a no 4 all over. Now not so much to clear up when it comes out. Wig fits better too. All prepared for next step. Look like a really funky old lady ha ha. One of GD's birthday party today.Going to do face really carefully, lots of eye makeup, blusher etc. Nice big earrings. If don't look too scarey wig staying in box. The thought of you sitting out of the wind brought a smile to my face :-) As you say wigs at the ready, sure you will look lot more gorgeous than me but DH and I have been together 48 years and he still thinks I look like the day we met in The Cavern Club, Liverpool all those years ago. ( will have to clean his spectacles ! ) Keep strong Traii.have a fun SE free weekend. Liefie, your post moved me to a little weep. My son lives in another city, I told him by phone and then heard nothing for about eight weeks. Really don't know how he feels but may find out one day. My two married daughters both live nearby and have been a great support, lots of spoiling. :-) Carla, I can't wait to log on here each morning too. BC can be a lonely journey but not with these ladies it isn't. I used to wait until alone then cry like a good un. Then as liefie says thought enough and get fighting the bxxxh ! you will find that you will get to the anger part eventually. Tell DH and kids it may happen, and to just ignore your outbursts it is all part of the grieving process that your body has seemingly betrayed you. Just try and find a bit of joy in each day, Laugh when you can, cry if you need to but just come out fighting. Please have some joy and laughter this weekend. Ladies, I have just heard the most heartwarming story. My friends daughter and her two friends are having their hair shaved off to raise funds to send their friend who has cancer and her four year old to Disneyworld !! They are all working Mum's with toddlers and they reckoned it would get a quick result and bring awareness of BC too.Angels without wings springs to mind. Joy and laughter to you all. Edi",

They don't mind how silly you may think your questions are. I carry my notebook at all times in my bag it is my lifeline. So sorry this is happening to you at your age, I am 64 but still can't believe it is happening to me, just as life was becoming relaxed and fun after years of family and hard work. There is no age at which it is not a horrendous DX. I do not feel or act my age, there is no history of this in my family either. BC is a bitch. Glad to hear you are eating  more, little and often is the best. I had lumpectomy, only small dent hardly noticeable. friends who have had it are the same.Jennie is right do not rush into anything, get advice from your professionals see if there is a group at the hospital of ladies you can discuss things with, the same as you can on here.  So glad other side is ok and nodes too.All good news.",

Avoid messing with mine once combed into place in the morning, quick spray of cement type hair gel and that's me ready lol. Your future op sounds very promising and perky boobs are a definite bonus.

We have placed her in a soft warm hammock with lots of fresh spring water to refresh her. Dakota has joined us after travelling from the black hills, we are building her up for her impending battle with the BC Bxxxh. Liefie is running around the camp collecting fuel for our fire this evening. She puts us all to shame with her energy. Traii and I are sitting waiting patient ly for bearcub to come and shave off our falling locks with her dagger blade  ( electric to avoid infection ) We are jealous of the halo of curls erupting from under her headdress. Be gentle please bearcub. Curveball is staying away from any naked flames as are we all right now. A sudden trump of gas could send any of us into outerspace !! Think that we have inflicted some serious damage to BC bxxxh but we are collecting our weapons and armour, cleaning and sharpening them all. Slapping on our war paint and preparing for the next battle. On the far horizon we can see the glint of the armour of new warriors who have heard of us being brought here by the rest of our tribe.

DH calmed me down and off we went.  Had to go to one hospital to have wires inserted to help surgeon find my BC accurately. This was the start of an amazing day, the staff were kind, supportive and so positive I started to think I  can't let them down either so took a deep breath and went to the second hospital for the operation.  They were waiting for me and before I knew it I was prepared, silly gown and socks too. They let my DH come with me to the  doors leading to the operating theatre.   Quick goodbye to DH then chat to surgeon, lots of laughter and silly jokes then drifting off into blissful sleep. When i came around I really thought I was home in bed and all this was still to come the realisation that it was over was wonderful. Two slices of hot buttered toast and a cup of tea later I realised that all my fears were unfounded. I was sent home six hours later and at the moment tiny bit sore, but with lots of pain relief on hand. A really bright blue right boob ( from the injection for lymph nodes Thursday ) and never again will I be such a coward.   Benny hope your pain easing, . Your new horse is very lucky to have you as their mom.   Hope all of you have a restful sleep and a pain and stress free day. ",

He raised a lot of money and we are so proud of him.Talking of cold the icing sounds as if it will be a good thing for Traii. The tips on here are so helpful to us all. Dakota, Go Girl !! Yay. Well done, I had the dizzy part and turned out it was SE of anti sickness medication. Day 10 today and feel brilliant, you just rest a bit, do a bit, rest a bit. Works for me. I am like Traii, pooping like a good un, yuk. Didn't go for three days and the pain was awful. Locked myself in the loo with radio, magazine and cup of tea.I know, yuk. After one, hour finally went. Bit more info than you needed I know, but I now have a tangerine or orange each evening and seems to have sorted me out.Like Traii gone the other  way now :-( Still if that's the only SE bring it on.

Read DH what your onco said about ladies hair blowing off in the wind, the look of horror on his face was priceless ! lol. Think I might be going out with crash helmet on to the shops next week ha ha. Know the spread you mean, like that too. Piccallili really popular here especially with cold meat for xmas buffets.

If your Mum is like me Lumpectomy and sentinel node removal, they then check tumour and lymph node and let you know for sure.  I waited three weeks for my operation and then a further two  weeks for these results. Yes all the waiting is the very worst part but they were right. No spread into breast surrounding tissue, also none to lymph nodes.  The operation was nothing like I thought in at 11 am home 6.30 pm. Felt wonderful, very little discomfort and went out for dinner the next evening. Tiniest of scars no one believes I have had an operation. I will have chemo and radiotherapy for about six months as mine is hormone negative and I can't have tablets. but as my Consultant said this is an insurance policy to keep me well and help me live a long life. A few weeks wait between appointments seems to be normal with most people. Frapp is right it all sounds as good as a diagnosis can. There is nothing that your Mum has or hasn't done to make this happen. My best friend has never smoked, rarely drinks, fit and healthy and BC struck. No family history etc. Our Consultant just says it is pure bad luck. They have no explanation why it happens to some and not others. Look at Kyle Minogue, Anastasia, and so many others. Just be there for her, give her lots of cuddles,sure she needs them right now. Best medicine ever ! ",

Mine was all removed with no spread and no lymph gland involvement so hope your Mum is same. Sorry your Doctor not good on the bedside manner. We have Macmillan Nurses here. Once the Doctor has told you his findings he leaves to move onto the next patient, the nurses then spend as long as it takes to answer all your questions then give you phone no to ring whenever you need help after that. Do check if you have anything like this. I am lucky in that my consultant is an amazing caring man but know there are many like your Mum's it doesn't mean she doesn't care just she can't show empathy. My friends Doctor was like that but knew his job and has cured her. No matter which operation your Mum has the cancer will be removed and that is the best feeling in the world. Anything after that will be another step on her journey back to being well again. It may be weeks of radiotherapy or like me about six months of chemo and rads. I am planning the rest of my life after BC and you will both soon be doing the same. (((( Hugs )))) to you both. Try and find someone to help with your questions.

If anyone mentions my BC he goes on about how he had a bowel cancer scare ( he was ok ) it feels almost as if he is trying to minimise mine. He is supportive in that he takes me to appointments and we have no little ones to worry about but I feel deep down that he is feeling a bit lost and helpless so when he says something a bit flippant or unfeeling I try to rise above it. Your hubby like mine is probably afraid for you and doesn't want to let you out of his sight but doesn't know how to tell you. Give him a cuddle, even if you really want to smack him, it works for me.  :-))",

She was bought for me by my DH, but she adored him and only him !  Six years ago he discovered a small lump near her teat, straight to the vet and the diagnosis of BC came back. Further tests showed it was a really bad strain and she wouldn't be around much longer. That amazing little dog lived another five years with no treatment other than the removal of her teats down one side of her body.DH told her she would be ok and she believed him. He says the same to me and I too believe him.We must all believe it won't beat us !!",

Yesterday at chemo I was chatting to lovely young man who was on his last treatment and as he is self employed he has worked after chemo since day one ! He also reckons and I am sure he is right that if you expect the worst it will happen. They gave me some anti sickness pills to take today ( I have no nausea at the moment by the way ) read the side effects and omg ! one of which could be fits ! going to ring my onco nurse now and see if I have to take them. Today I go to Bingo with my BC buddy Bel and all being well we might win.yay. Then hopefully will show my Black widow spider costume off at Halloween party. Cross everything for me please and you keep that chin up. Liefie, thanks for good wishes and have lots of hibernating jobs lined up if it all goes bottom up. Bearcub, hope everything ok with you ?

Slept like a baby last night so feel like a new woman ( bet DH wishes I was ) every time I turn around a tray of food appears I will soon put on weight I lost at this rate. Boob aching bit like pulled muscle pain, Ibuprofen helps but it isn't bad and I know I am a lucky lady. After shower looked in mirror and blue boob looks back ! Makes things look much worse than they are, bruising starting but hey ho that will fade. Best part is my BC cut out, just hope it hasn't left anything behind or spread, two weeks until I know so going to have to cross that bridge when I get to it. Bearcub the wire thing was scarey !! they placed big pad over it and then I had my sweater over that. Got to second hospital, nurse doing BP pulls wire of machine over me and I thought she had caught it !! luckily just the strip of the dressing so panic over. Benny hope you are feeling better, sending out some of my lucky healing vibes to you now. Thank you bonnets,Lesley and liefie healing vibes to you all too. X",

I am diabetic and it can make you so confused and spaced out. Please eat little and often, give yourself little treats throughout the day you need to keep that level.I have only had it as bad as you once many years ago. I walked through an Austrian Hotel in my pj's ( luckily not see thru ) thought I was dreaming at the time. DH realised I had left the bedroom and found me sitting in the dining room next to a really startled couple as I ate a bowl of cereal. Don't ever want to repeat that. :-(  Our  bodies have been through the mill, pain is awful but keep up the meds, I hate tablets but hate pain more. If you can't sleep find a goal, don't think about not sleeping, you will eventually. I have always wanted to write a book, never had time, now I have that will fill my wakeful hours. If I ever finish it will send you a copy. Sure by then you will be too busy riding your new horse to read it. I have told everyone that I am learning to ride. After the laughter stops they look at me with new eyes. This is MY time, my needs are paramount BC has made this happen.I now say what I am thinking, main one is NO. Feel liberated.! DH is so good, he is back at work today and have txt him to say all ok.Will potter about, bit of laundry, excercises ( don't want a frozen shoulder ) Seems he enjoys housework, now I let him do it, ha ha. If people offer help and I am sure they will, let them do it Benny they get back more than they give, Karma. Keep cuddling your gorgeous cat. I still cuddle mr ted he doesn't purr worse luck, DH snores, not quite the same.  May healing and joy rain down on all you lovely ladies today and every day.",

Weather here today pretty dreadful, cold and damp, leaves are starting to fall but garden still has colour as plants thriving due to very wet last few months. Gosh snow where you are coming soon ? dread that here in England. We really don't cope at all well. few years ago depot's ran out of grit for the roads so we skated in our cars to work ! Salt and grit for paths also sold out everywhere. Looks as if winters are changing for the worse now, hope the powers that be get their act together. We do really impressive parades and celebrations but are rubbish at looking after our roads etc. hope you have a lovely day, I am catching up with friends before treatment starts for coffee and a chat.",

Mine is a warm honey blonde with highlights and as my own hair grey and boring at the moment due to fact gave up colouring it when BC struck she sussed pretty quick ! Her Mum came to collect her and thought it was fantastic, we then laughed til we cried as GD put it on with my clip on earrings and was Nana. Even DH had a go and looked like Rod Stewart lol. Your employer sounds wonderful, doesn't it all make such a difference ? I work a couple of evenings a week as a waitress in our local country pub. When BC hit they were and still are amazing. My job is there when tr eatment finished and one day my lovely boss arrived with my last weeks wages, it was six times more than I expected ! Holiday pay he said. Wouldn't take no for an answer. If I needed money for anything I was just to ask. Luckily we are retired and comfortable but how lovely and I will never forget their kindness. Night before 1st chemo told DH to bring me around to pub. Hugs and huge bouquet from them,they ring every week if I don't get in to see them. Boss did freefall from aeroplane on Saturday to raise money for BC too. Hope ice helps with your next chemo, mine is on 20th when's yours ? Chicken stir fry, yum, find taste buds bit funny so craving really strong flavours had cheese and piccallili for my tea. That did the trick.

Nervous wreck leaving the house, DH was very calm but think it was worse for him. When we got to the hospital felt surrounded by caring kind people straight away. Short wait then nurse arrived introduced himself and before I knew it I was hooked up to anti sickness drip arm resting on lovely soft pillow. Needle for IV went in no problem and we were away. First of three syringes full went up tea and buscuits arrived for me and DH. Chemo went through in about half an hour but I kn ow that everyone's are different, even if yours takes longer time literally flies by. Then extra fluid to flush through chemo and before I knew it was on my way home feeling right as ninepence ! Had a lovely lunch of scrambled eggs on toast with cheese on top, all cooked by me as DH looks as if he has been run over poor love ha ha. . You have to go through it but let me know if you agree that these lovely ladies know what they are talking about. Bought three beautiful 100 percent cotton squares and silk ties nd I am becoming pretty good at making very glamourous headwear. Want to be ready to face my public looking as glam as a 64 year old can when I need them in about 2-3 weeks. Chin up Dakota and come out fighting (( hug )) Benny r u any better  ?",

DH loves the shopping and is delighted to come home and show me his bargains. I clean when I am energetic and read or watch TV when I don't.Envy you your cleaning lady, how lovely that you kept her on. More important things in life than dusting ! seven days after 1st session and still feel really good. Bit of cleaning this morning, then a good sort out of some drawers then shower and very gentle hair wash, ha ha. know it won't fall out yet but when no one is looking give it a quick tug to make sure. cbear, big hug to you, this is the worse time for you but I promise it does ease. Please eat, you are not feeding it. You need to be strong to fight, eat well and DO NOT go on the internet looking up anything, just ask on here or your care team. I surfed like a mad woman and had myself dead and buried. So many things that aren't true on there as well.I have IDC too and as my beautiful nurse said, it is the most common form of BC and therefore they know so much about it they will have you back to good health before you know it. Mine is not hormone related so I am having chemo and rads, don't be afraid you have found us and we are here for you. We all imagine it growing out of control but it is not happening. Traii is right. I think mine has maybe been there a year. 2cm removed with a lumpectomy, now chemo, rads, are my insurance policy for plenty more years BC free.My delay was a month by the way tumour still the same as when first found. We are all on the same journey, we will hold your hand.",

Good luck with the tongue mine only lasted one day, what does salt water help with ? have seen it recommended a few times.Sore nails sounds awful, I know you shouldn't have a mainicure except with your own manicure set and only use nail clippers not scissors. I really can't work those, always use scissors so will just be extra careful. Did you win on the race ? do hope so. BBQ sounds lovely and as you say chemo ain't stopping us having fun. See one of your  operations was three days after mine and on the same side too. I am trying to be sooo careful not to do anything to right hand and arm i.e. cut,burn etc and have finally got into lifting with left arm. How are you coping with it all ? Edi.",

Looking at beautiful GD's ( 4 ) still makes me want to cry, but I have every intention of being around to listen to all their secrets for a long ,long time. Like you, did all the right things but BC still happened.   We are lucky we found it when we did and all my team keep telling me its the commonest form of BC and very cureable. No reason not to believe them but it is still a shock.Now you know what you are up against just join us all on this journey and you will find it easier with the ladies on here to support you. I definitely do. Traii, 20th for mine, yep 3 weekly. How many you having? I have four of this one then four of a different one. Don't blame you not telling DS about wig, at that age goodness knows what he might do.Heard of a lady who's wig blew off in our local supermarket car park. She just laughed and chased after it. Don't know if I could be that brave. lol. Piccalilli is mustard pickle, lots of bits of veggie's, cauli,onion, gherkin in spicy mustard sauce. Yummy, craved it when pregnant.Oops now THAT would be a laugh wouldn't it? GD would be delighted ( she would look after it ) wants a baby sister/brother but ED says no way, too expensive and at 40 she doesn't think she could go through it again.I could make a fortune as the oldest Mother ever ha ha.

Is it for the nodes ? If it is that one it helps them pin point the nodes more accurately during surgery. My surgeon went over boob in ante room and mini geiger counter told him just where they were. After surgery boob bright blue one side ( the dye ) that was in Sept. It has almost gone now but I treat that as one of my battle scars. Know what you mean about holding it in, we all do it but if you need to talk, we are here. My dx similar to yours, no MRI given, Surgeon assured me it would all be gone and then chemo. You may not find out which one for quite a time after surgery. You need to heal first. Not all chemo causes constipation. I was the opposite :-( but only for a little while. You may have no side effects :-) Whatever happens DO NOT suffer in silence contact someone, they can help with all aspects don't just think\" I am having chemo so I must suffer\" I had one little hiccup ( terrible dizziness ) rang up and it was side effect of the anti sickness pills. They cut them down and I was bouncing around like a biddy on a bit of string. As my Mum used to say. Operation removed the tumour, no spread, nodes clear. Was home six hours later eating my dinner. Minimal discomfort.Even if you are having different surgery you will be fine. I was scared witless on the day, then thought this will get BC out. I definitely felt incredible relief after, as will you. Have you been given a date for operation yet ?We will all be there for you in spirit. Hope work went well. Dakota, you are one brave warrior. How you doing today ? Will check in later. Edi x",
