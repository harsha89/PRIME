I'm enjoying life after chemo - I haven't felt this well for quite awhile. I have fair skin and hoping no skin issues. Right now I'm using \"Udderly Smooth\" and love it, but the Calendula cream was recommended as well. I may try that also. Interested in any skin care tips from those in the know. Thanks!",

But once I was diagnosed and then met with my treatment team I feel very confident things will work out. I was diagnosed with IDC, 2.7 cm, ER+, PR+, HER-. Waiting for a genetics panel, then mastectomy. If my lymph nodes look ok hormone therapy. My cancer subtype is Luminal A. I appreciate all of the support and prayers I am receiving. I would like to add, that during my many sleepless nights and whenever I feel afraid, I read the many posts on this site and feel comforted. Thanks everyone! Monica!",
