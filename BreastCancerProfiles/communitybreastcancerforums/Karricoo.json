There is a history of Breast cancer in my family, so I worried when I found a small hard lump deep in the tissue of my under arm back in March so I spoke to my dr but it was very small and they said wait and see but by July the lump had grown and I had started getting a yellow/green colour discharge from my left breast so I went back to my dr and was told the lump is not a swollen lymphnode and felt like a mass of some sort and the discharge was not normal, so after a thorough breast exam I was told that she would be referring me to the breast surgeons for evaluation. I received an appointment for this Monday to attend the general surgery dept at my local hospital. I am now really worried and have not slept in nearly 2 weeks, Since I saw my dr. Should I be worried? Or am I panicking for nothing?? Sorry for the long post but I am really scared that this is cancer. Log in to post a reply",
