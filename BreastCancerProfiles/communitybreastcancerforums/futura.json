Thought I would share and ask couple questions and I'm hoping to help others too. After my yearly mammo (BIRADS 0) in May; I was called back for further images or Diagnostic Mammo, due to 2 areas of Calcification. I had my Diagnostic Mammo (BIRADS 4) and was asked to come back for stereotactic breast biopsy again for 2 areas of Calcification. During the biopsy they were able to biopsy only one area because I was taking asprin (80mg) and stopped only 3 days before. I was bleeding a lot. They had to stop. It came benign but fibrocystic changes and PASH. Then I was scheduled for the 2nd biopsy for 2 weeks later. This time the biopsy results came benign but ADH and they recommended I see a breast surgeon. I have been reading about ADH and trying to educate myself as much as possible before my appointment w/ BS on Wednesday. The protocol is to have lumpectomy and sometimes some medication and/or in some cases radiation? Anyone who had 2 areas of calcification one being ADH and the other normal? I'm also interested in exploring natural supplements to keep immune system strong any reco's with supplements that you'd like to recommend for ADH will be great. Thanks everyone and have a great Sunday!",
