I had an appointment today but my mother told me last minute to cancel it.  She told me that the last sonogram she received at that site turned out so unclear that her doctor needed her to get another one someplace else.  Thus, she will take me wherever she goes to get an updated sonogram.  Hopefully it is done by next week because I just want to know what is going on with my breasts.  I am quite impatient.  After I get the sonogram, then what?  My mother said that they send you the results in the mail.   I am a bit untrusting of my gyno.  While he was checking me during my last visit he asked if there was any cancer in my family.  I looked at him like he was not a doctor, as if he has not had my mother and I as patients for the past three years.  Shouldn't he know that my mother had cancer?     I asked my mother if she had the genetic type and she said no but my mother is very hard to read and I hate to say I doubt her but I would feel more comfortable finding out from her oncologist.   Thank you for your responses, it is reassuring and relieving to get my thoughts down in writing and I hope everyone has a lovely day. ",
