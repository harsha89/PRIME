I too did the same thing found a dimesize lump back in Sept 2009 thought to myself im only 35 its nothing im to young for BC. Then a week ago I had a yearly exam and my Dr found a very large mass in my right breast same spot I had felt the dimesize mass back in Sept. I have been kicking myself for a week for not keeping an eye on the Mass I had avoided rechecking myself. Reading others stories I relize I'm not the only one who put it off. My U/S is scheduled for the 18th. Looks like we are both waiting HUGS hopfully both of ours will come back benign. Best Of Luck & Bestwishes",

Im 36 back last sept when I was still 35 I found a dimesize lump I ignored it do to my age and it wasnt exactly circular its kinda weird shaped in the last few months I noticed my right breast looking and feeling firmer then my left I went in to the GYN for a yearly exam last week that dimesize lump my DR found execpt now its not dimesize its more like a irregular shaped golfball. Im still waiting for my U/S appnt on the 18th so who knows what the lump is but if I had knew then that age is not a discrimination with BC I wouldv got checked out last year. Be safe then sorry sweetheart many hugs and best wishes",
