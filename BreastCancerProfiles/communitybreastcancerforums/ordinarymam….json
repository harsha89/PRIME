Dan Silverman MD, PhD is UCLA researcher and Idelle Davidson is a journalist who went through breast cancer therapy.  I have only skimmed the book so far, but (1) They say neuroimaging shows cognitive changes 5-10 years post chemo (2) tamoxifen can increase the cognitive impairment...and (3) there are diet, physical, pharmaceutical, and lifestyle changes you can make to improve cognitive function.  Here is an article they wrote called \"What to ask your doctor about post-chemo brain\": http://news.cancerconnect.com/your-brain-after-chemo/ Here is a blog where folks are telling their stories: http://yourbrainafterchemo.blogspot.com/ There is a NY Times article by Jane Brody describing what they suggest for recovery, but I can't remember how to find it... I still don't have enough information about whether I will recover from the damage I might have already inflicted on myself, and whether there is any way to protect my brain if I decide to continue with the recommended 4 rounds.

I'm not surprised you're finding most of your info on the discussion boards. I'm a nurse who works on the oncology unit of my hospital, and I find most of my info...on the discussion boards. A quick note about penguin cold caps to try to prevent hair loss. Unless your oncologist is extraordinary, he/she will pooh pooh them, either saying they don't work or else because of worry of scalp metastases (yes, breast cancer can spread to the scalp). Cold caps are highly experimental in the US--only about 200 women have tried them--though there has been great success in Europe (which apparently doesn't count as far as US oncologists are concerned).  There are published (non-US, I'm afraid) reports showing no increased scalp metastases.  I'm day 32 cold capping on TC. Still have my hair. Could be cold caps, could be luck. They ARE a mega hassle, though, and expensive too.   But I'm going to continue with them, just in case they work. About icing nails, I'm surprised your onc hasn't said anything, it's so well known. Look at \"docetaxel\" on wikipedia for heaven's sake: half way down the page there's a photo of a smiling woman getting Taxotere (docetaxel) and icing her nails. My recurrence score was 25 and chemo probably only gives me a 3% benefit. I think I would have been happier doing chemo if I got your whopping 7% benefit. Then again, precious little makes me happy about cancer, these days!  Also, I decided to do chemo because I see so many women have difficulties with tamoxifen and AI's.  According to the 6/28/10 Journal of Oncology, only 49% of women who embark on tam or AI's finish a full 4.5 years.  If I end up one of the \"non-adherent\" women, I expect to be grateful to myself for addressing the cancer scourge with chemo.",

It's funny how different surgeons have different procedures.  As soon as I was walking the morning postop, the surgeon was telling me I should be windmilling my arms. I went home postop day #2-- with no activity, lifting or driving restrictions; \"make sure to do your exercises;\" and two 400 ml Hemovac style drains, each draining two tubes per side.  Different from the bulb jackson-pratt drains I'd seen other mastectomy patients using. The tubing is incredibly thick and sturdy; there's no way I could squeeze it to \"strip\" the tubing, but then again I think the drains have quite a bit of suction power--some large rasty gooey clot thingies have been sucked into and trapped in them.  They have three springs inside and I need to use both hands to flatten them against a hard surface after emptying them. In the hospital, I used a LOT of IV morphine through the patient controlled pump and came home on percocet.  I still need to take a couple during the day and two before bed.  I take 300 mg of docusate and 2 senna a day, but even with a high fiber diet, I'm not as regular as I'd like.  Not much appetite, either, though I know I should be forcing the good nutrition for healing. I have great range of motion, though when I stretch the left side, there's a little difficulty and pain before it loosens up. All in all, things have been much easier than I anticipated.  I've walked a couple of miles every day, but still haven't had the courage go out in public.

I was in the process of getting \"chemo certified\" when I was diagnosed, and I tried hard to continue at work (thinking I \"only\" had DCIS, with no chemo in my future) and continue training, but I was stress stupid.  As surgery neared, I didn't think I was a safe, smart nurse, and I stayed out.  Now when I think of receiving the infusions that I was learning to give--and suffering the SE's I was educating and medicating others for--I am shocked and appalled.  I don't think there is any way I could drum up the mental sharpness and physical stamina and emotional reserves to work while I'm undergoing chemo.

I'm a fairly new nurse--graduated in 2006, as a 44-yr-old.  Worked nights for 3 years, only on days for a few months before dx.  One of my fellow grads, a wonderful friend, worked nights only a few months at the beginning, but was dx'd with IDC a year ago.  My BF has worked nights--loves it--for at least 10 years and is fine.",
