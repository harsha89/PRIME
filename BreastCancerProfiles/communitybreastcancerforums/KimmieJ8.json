I found a know under my ar 2 years ago and I did not and still do not have insurance or medicaid so I never had it looked at. As time has passed, I have started have alot of problems. I am afraid the knot is no severe and I may be getting sick. I have a numb arm all the time, I stay sick to my stomach and I have pain in back, breast and arm. Today I started having throat problems. I am scared that this is breast cancer and it is too late to get anything done about it. After 2 years of fighting the DSS in my county I can finally get medicaid but if it is too late, is it worth it? I am really scared can anyone tell me if I still got a chance if that is what this is, and if it something I should attempt to do on my own.  Log in to post a reply",

If my other symptoms are not signs I can calm down a little. I was worried that I had let it go on too long.",
