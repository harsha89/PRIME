I agree it's not common and it worries us too. We are early in the diagnosis and haven't done surgery or chemo yet. Needless to say, we are terrified and wish you the very best. Her diagnosis is IDC and chemo is going to be recommended we think.",

However, it's possible hers was imovvable first. They say these take years to grow so pre august, it's hard for us to provide insight. I'm sorry but I hope your treatments and journey are successful. This is a tough thing to manage through.",

I'm sorry your reaction to the chemo wasn't great and I i wish I had a better answer than my heartfelt regret for your situation. Have you discussed with your doctor? This site is also pretty incredible in terms of resources for women in your predicament (and my wife's). Maybe posting a topic regarding alternative therapies or options could make sense? I'm sure many could chime in..",
