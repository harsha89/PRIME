In August 2011, I had a ultra-sound guided core Bx done after my mamomgram showed and questionable grey area. Durring the Bx, the radiologist said more than once the mass that was presenting on the screen did not look like a cancerous lesion. However, she moved forward with taking 4 core Bx specimens. About 10 days later I got the call that I had IDC. After many tears and sleepless nights, I decided to have a Lumpectomy and hope for clear margins and nodes. About 10 days later my surgen called and told me that the pathology from my lumpectomy was back and to his surprise I did not have IDC. It was a false positive. But I did have low grade DCIS. I live in a large city was being treated at a well respected teaching hospital with a state of the art cancer center. Even though a lumpectomy is standard treatment for DCIS, what if I had chosen to do a Bi Lat masectomy? Not to mention that a sentinal node Bx would have been unnessary with a Dx of DCIS. Dont get me wrong...I am greatfull for the early detection and thankful I chose to be more conservative with surgery. Getting a second opinion never crossed my mind, but moving forward, I will always request one. My surgen and I both agreed to send out my surgical pathology for a second opinion, just to be sure my Dx of DCIS is the correct Dx beyond a resonable doubt.",
