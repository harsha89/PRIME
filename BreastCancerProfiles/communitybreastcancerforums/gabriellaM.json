Thanks!",

We are meeting with a surgeon today and what I know so far is that she has a 6-10 cm tumor, described as poorly differentiated, and the one lymph node that they checked during her biopsy was positive. I don't know ER/PR status yet. My mom is 80 years old and has mild-moderate Alzheimers so limited understanding of what is going on. Does anyone know how one usually proceeds in this kind of situation? I assume the surgeon/oncologist will give us more info but just wondering if anyone has been or known someone in this situation. Thanks. BTW I had DCIS and had BMX in March (BRCA+) and I'm feeling fine. My mom's situation seems so different to mine as to almost be a different disease. I did not need chemo or radiation.",
