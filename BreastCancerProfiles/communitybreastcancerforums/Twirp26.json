I know many of you have even younger kids. Today was the first day of school. I did what I always do and take their pictures in front of the palm tree in front of our house with fingers raised showing what grade they are in. Today was hard for me. I had feelings of dispair as I sent them off. \" what if this is the last time I do this?\" I hate when i get this way. I know it doesn't help at all! I feel angry that I even have to deal with this. I want to be around when my kids send their kids to school!!! Just had to vent",

I just signed the paperwork to start a clinical trial at md Anderson. I am sick with fear. Traditional therapy has not worked. I feel like I keep getting kicked down. I pray everyday that this will help me. I don't want to leave my kids or hubby. I'm going to see about therapy to help with anxiety. I know I need to live in the moment but I am crippled with fear. It does help to know I am not alone. I pray for everyone going through this.",

I guess they are always our babies no matter how old. Anyway, I loved reading your post. It gives me some hope that these bad days will dwindle more. I am in the process of qualifying for a trial. Unfortunately I have not responded to standard chemos. I'm praying for my miracle. I want more time!! Best of luck to you and your family",

I have cancer in my left breast, with lymph node involvement. my right breast is clear except several small cysts. I'm pretty certain I want to have a mastectomy. I do not have family history and my genetic test came back negative. My BC seems pretty conservative. I just wanted to see if you had cancer in the other breast or did you decide to just take them both for peace of mind? I am really leaning this way but have no idea if it would be covered by insurance or if I would have to pay out of pocket. I know I don't want to do this again, I feel like I would sleep better knowing i was aggressive in my treatment. I'm trying to find out from women who have done this before. Thanks!!!",
