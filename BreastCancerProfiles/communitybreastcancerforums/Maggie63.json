Started rads almost immediately (about a week after chemo completion) and finished my rads in February 2009  -  I am still getting Herceptin tx once every three weeks - that will go on until August - almost there  -  yay!!!!!!! I am somewhat discouraged about my hair growth.  I started to lose my hair about a week or two after my first chemo tx (late August/early September).  I went and had it cut ultra short - not shaved though.  I've been wearing a wig since!!!  I started to grow 'peach fuzz'  (white/gray)sometime in December - I think around 3 weeks after chemo tx was completed.  To me, it seems to be taking FOREVER!!!!!   Right now, the back is doing good!! I'd estimate it to be about 2-1/2 - 3\", and fairly full.   BUT, the front, top and sides are sooooo thin and close to my head  -  there is no volume at all - probably only measures about1\".  What we would call sideburns, is also a not too bad length - but above that and on the top is super thin and short!!!!   I am really discouraged about it - some say, it will catch up with the back,  but I am just so upset that it is taking so long.  And, I guess a big part of my problem is that I am vain (wish I weren't), and yet I am sooooo sick of wearing the wig - and now that the weather here in NJ is beginning to be springlike - I can't stand the thing on my head  -  the second I walk in the house, off it comes!!!   KATHIMDGD & SUSAN13:  I admire you both  -  I like what you said Kathi, that if no one likes it, that's their problem.  And, you're so right - we went through hell with the cancer, the surgery, and all the chemo, rads, etc. why should we be uncomfortable just to please others!!!!! I just need the nerve to get out there and go 'TOPLESS' - I am proud of you!!!!   Maybe if I think hard enough about you gals doing it, you will be my inspiration.  I truly want to, but I chicken out every time I think I'll try.  My dh tells me to go for it - he says, do you think anyone cares or will think anything less of you?  He keeps telling me that I do not look as bad as I think I do - Does anyone know if it will 'thicken' in time?  I'm getting so impatient.  Another thing:  does anyone know if it would be okay to color it - or do you have to wait until it is a full fledged head of hair???   I would like to go back to my ash blonde that I had from Clairol for years now, before the beast entered in.   Sorry, ladies, didn't mean to go on and on like this  -  I'm really going to try and 'flip my wig', -  thanks sisters!!!!!  I will keep thinking of your courage!!!!!!

I probably should go to the beauty salon and get what I have shaped into a style - maybe then it wouldn't look so bad???   But ladies, for the most part, everyone here seems to be doing well  -  we each have our own 'complaints' to bitch about.  But that's all so normal.  This is great that we can all vent and everyone that reads our 'venting sessions' can sooooo relate  -  we are all in the same boat - we'll all keep afloat!!!!!

And like Lori said, everyone is different!  You may not notice any SE's or you may get something different.  But, I don't think any of the possible SE's are unbearable or dangerous.  Good luck - keep posting!!!!   Hugs,  Maggie",

I got up the nerve and went out without the wig, but I did wear a baseball cap - but at least the little hair showing on the sides and back is my own!!!!  Met a few neighbors and I almost freakin' froze  -  but no one even showed any reaction  -  but I'm sure they mentally had some opinion.  But, like my DH said, who cares?       At least I \"broke the ice\".  I know I am my own worst enemy, for sure!!!!!!  Hate it, but can't help it.  I forgot to mention aside from the Herceptin, I'm also taking Femara (the five year pill).  Alot of oncs go with the Arimidex, but mine obviously opted for the Femara - what the difference is I have no clue - but they both supposedly do the same job.  Have a great weekend, girls!!!!    And, thanks again - as we all know the support we give each other on here is phenomenal  -   sooooooo very helpful!!!!!!

Well, glad to hear that most of us are 'on our way' to having a full head of hair EVENTUALLY!! Have a great weekend everyone! Maggie",

I've lost 6 so far - but it's not easy  -  I'm trying to eat less, but properly, and try to walk at least one mile a day.  It's a start at least!    Keep growing, ladies!!!!!   Have a great night, all!!!

This, like most of you, has been a long haul  -  but THERE IS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!!!!  I can almost see a spark!!!!    Good luck to everyone - and God Bless us all!!!!   I will stop by again and see how everyone is doing.  Maggie ",
