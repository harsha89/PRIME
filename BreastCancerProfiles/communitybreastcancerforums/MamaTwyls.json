    "Content": "MamaTwyls wrote: Last July (2015) I had a lumpectomy which was b9, fibro-cystic tissue, and b9 micro-calcifications. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to the tape after surgery, and ended up with blistering and a rash that took months to fade. Where part of the rash was, I noticed some random skin changes, somewhat similar to online pics of peau d'orange. My cousin was dxed with ibc last year (she's now cancer free!) which I'd the only reason I even thought twice about the changes. I have an appt next week for a diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, and appt with the breast surgeon, so I'm here mostly to ask if anyone has had an allergic reaction to surgical wrappings? I can't seem to find anything online about whether skin changes this long after is normal. I'm trying not to obsess, so if this sounds to anxious, tips to ward anxiety off are appreciated, too!
