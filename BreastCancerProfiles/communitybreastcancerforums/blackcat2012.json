Comments: A duct along an edge of one of the cores exhibits partially detached, proliferated ductual epithelium consistent with intraductal epithelial hyperplasia. No overt atypia is identified. Regardless, the material does not explain the presence of a mass and accordingly may not be representative of the clinical process in question.  Correlation with the clinical and radiographic findings with close follow-up, and rebiopsy if clinically indicated, is suggested.   They told me that the results are inconclusive and that I need surgery to have it removed. At first I was all for it, but now with the waiting I do not want to do it.  I want to hold off and see if it shows up as cancerous.   This is the second inconclusive biopsy result.
