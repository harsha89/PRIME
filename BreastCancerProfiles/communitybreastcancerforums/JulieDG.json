I've been seeing an orthopedic oncologist, and he actually thought we should do rads before considering surgery--and that if rads caused my tumor to shrink, then we might avoid surgery.  My regular onc advised the same.  Now I'm wondering if that was wise--and that I need hip replacement anyway. (Not to mention I feel awful from the radiation therapy.) One big question I've got is this: how long was it until you were back to normal after hip replacement surgery?  I mean walking normally, without a cane or walker, doing normal activities.  This is such a huge quality of life issue.  Thanks so much for any feedback. Best, Julie       ",
