I'm 7.5 months PFC, and while my hair is growing in, it's so thin and sparse with scalp clearly showing, especially on the top. I bought some of the rogain women's 5% foam, but when I apply it it seems like I'm getting more in my hair than on the scalp lol.  I've tried \"parting\" it like the instructions say, but with only 3/4 inch of length that's not working so well.   TIA for any and all advice!

Several spots have little no hair and the rest is sparse and hardly growing much at all, maybe an inch long and I'm coming up on a year from my last chemo. I had a completely different chemo regimen than you, though, so hopefully yours will fill in much better than mine has :).",

Unfortunately I am one of the ones affected by the failure of my hair to return to the way it was pre-chemo. I had very thick and full hair before all this. I started to realize there was a problem about 10 weeks PFC, and that's when I started reading everything I could find, including this entire thread lol. The longest anyone posted it taking their hair to start growing was 3 months, so I figured maybe I was a slow grower. I didn't see any noticeable growth anywhere on my body for a full 3.5 months. No leg stubble, no arm hair, no underarm stubble, no pubic hair, and very few and far between sprouts on my head. The first to return was leg hair, which I promptly waxed off, only for it not to return for another three months. Once my head hair did start to grow it was patchy, sparse especially on top, and very fine. No stubble feeling. I have ended up with probably 2/3 of my original hair returning, and it is growing very slowly. One year PFC and I have 1.5 inches is all. If it ever gets any length to it it'll be workable, but at this point it's growing so slowly that I'm not comfortable going out in public without some kind of head cover. I'm going to talk to an endocrinologist next month just to be sure that this is a result of the taxotere, but I suspect it is. I think it's a good sign that you're already getting some stubble, and a little growth on your head. Remember, there's only about a 6-10% chance that these drugs will cause permanent hair loss, so there's a 90-94% chance that it won't. And, even though it's hard to hear (even after I've come to terms with it, it's still hard to hear lol), I've come to realize it really is just hair. I'm lucky to have had such a good response to treatment, given my diagnosis. Take care, and keep your chin up :)",

In my case I lost all hair everywhere except for a bit of my eyebrows and lashes. My lashes have returned to almost normal but not as long, and my eyebrows have not returned to normal at all. I'd say it might be a good sign that you've not lost everything, everywhere. As I said above, it's really a small percentage of patients who have this happen, but of course those are the stories you hear, since the vast majority of those who return to normal don't really have a reason to post about it.",
