Everyday I find something worrying and when I research it, hoping for a sign that it means I'm not dealing with what I might be dealing with, my hopes are dashed. I've seen first hand what cancer can do to someone, and it's absolutely devastating. I'd rather not deal with it, but I know that's out of my control. I keep going over everything in my mind. I use a flashlight to shine a light through my breasts every night. Trying to see if I can see anything that might mean something either way. My appetite is completely gone. Working helps temporarily, but my mind still drifts to the what ifs. What if it is cancer, what if it's already spread everywhere, what if i cant be treated because i dont have the money, what if it's not cancer and i've racked up whole bunch of debt, etc. I'm always anxious about my health and what abnormal symptoms could mean. I've gone to the doctors thinking the worse and doctors aren't able to find anything or they tell me it's something minor. It's always a relief, but I'm always in a mountain of debt. This time I feel like this could really be a bad outcome and I'm terrified. I will be covered by my job in January, but I don't know if I can wait. When it comes to cancer, I know time is of the essence. I think I'm still trying to work up the nerve to even make a call. I know it's silly to be worried about money, but because I've been wrong so many times before, it's like I don't want to take the chance of being wrong again and being back at square one with everything I've worked so hard to build these past few years. I know I'm an idiot. I'm still trying to figure out what to do. I'm not able to see my doctor until January, I just don't know if I can wait that long. I also just don't want to burden my family with bad news again this time of year. I hate being indecisive. It's my worst trait and I hate it so much.",

My mother died of stage 4 breast cancer, so as you can imagine, I'm terrified. I only found it because I was scratching an itch on that side of my breast. My breasts have been itchy at certain times. Mostly because I get heat rashes under my breast every spring/summer, but also because my skin is notoriously dry. After learning about IBC, I'm even more nervous. I feel like my breast always have some sort of rash these days. This isn't my first scare like this. I went to a doctor about four years ago because I kept having a sharp pain in my right breast. They did a mammogram and told me that everything was fine. The nurse told me I was too young to have breast cancer, that I have dense breast tissue, that a breast cancer lump would feel hard like a knuckle, and showed me how to do a self exam. I'll be honest, since I got the news that everything was fine that day, I haven't really kept up with doing breast exams. I'm mostly concerned because one lump does feel pretty hard like a knuckle. I also haven't had much of an appetite over the summer for some reason. It's picked back up, but I feel like I never feel incredibly hungry like I used to years before. I just started a new job, but unfortunately the insurance doesn't kick in until March, so I don't even know if I can afford to visit a doctor or get treatment if I were to need it. Then my other concern is if I go to a doctor now, and I am diagnosed as needing treatment, does it count as pre-existing condition when my insurance kicks in. It's hard to be around my family on a day like today. I don't want to say anything because the holidays are rough for us since my mom passed and I don't want to add to horrible memories. Trying to enjoy the day with them knowing what could be ahead and wondering if I'll be able to spend another Thanksgiving with them, is tough. I'm just trying act normally as best as I can. I hope everyone here is able to enjoy today in some way. Log in to post a reply",
