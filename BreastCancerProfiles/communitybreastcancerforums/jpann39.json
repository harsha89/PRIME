I found my lump, saw the doc, she sent me for mammo, they did ultrasound the same day....doc said needed biospy....he said he could do it right then so I agreed....I was afraid that if I left and had to think abou the biopsy in advance I wouldnt be able to make myself go back for it....

I read back a page or two so hopefully Im not already giving advice that someone else has already given. 4tngupnblu: you said something in one of your posts about bone lose and the dr. saying to up your calcium intake....I didnt have bone lose but was taking Arimidex so thought I should start taking a calcium +D supplement...I was taking 1200 mg per day as recommended and about 3 wks into it I was plagued with twitchy legs at night, so much so that it was keeping me awake....upon further research I found that if you take a calcium supplement you should so increase your magnesium intake as it helps your system obsorb the calcium....just a thought, if you start experiencing odd things you might back off on the dose of calcium (as I did) or add the mag and see what happens..... Penni: You were questioning whether or not to take tamoxifen during rads....I started the tamox in January and started rads in Feb...no one said not to take it during rads and I was a full 3 wks into rads before the nurse finally saw it in my chart and questioned it...she said they dont usually like you to take it during because in some people it can cause the radiation burns to be more severe...since I was already 3 wks into it and didnt have burn issues I took it all the way through....And the male tech thing!!!!! when I first started the tech was a woman, but then as time went on I ended up with two male techs...they were very discrete about things....keeping \"both boobs\" covered until immediately before zapping and then only exposing the portion the needed...they were very gentle and compasionate about it... Laynel57: Braless, no that is a conversation :)...Im smaller breasted so have always been able to go braless whenever I wanted but out grew those days and have worn one daily for years.....I stopped wearing a bra the first treatment and wore white cotton tank tops under other blouses and found it very comfy...it was kind of strange to be going to work braless though as I work in an office mainly of males..... Helensm: Tattoos-a conversation I will never forget having with my 27 yr old daughter....recently my daughter and her girl friend were over in the evening and we were discussing tattoos....both girls have discreet ones...I said \"hey, I have four...\" they laughed as they know I dont really have tattoos, so I ended up showing them the four tiny markers....I was teasing and said that the one on my inner/upper part of my breast that shows when I wear low cut tops I was going to have tattooed over with a smiley face....my daughter got the most ghastly look on her face.....she told me that I had just given her WAY too much information.....all I could do was laugh, she didnt think it was funny a week later either when I stopped by her home and walllllaaaaaa theres a  just barely peeking out of my neckline....I had gotten a fake one placed there just to tease her....we are very close, but she said I was pushing my luck .... Sorry my post is so long but you ladies just have WAY too much fun here .....Remember I will be back to check on you so keep up the good work girls.....your almost to the finish line!!!!!!!! (wow, that is almost scarey, I can only imagine the party you ladies will be throwing!!!!!!!) Hugs Jule",

There are alots of ladies who have had one node positive and chose no chemo. Im assuming since you are taking tamoxifen your stats were er positive so they would feel that anti-hormonals would do better for you than to risk the side effects of chemo for such a small benefit. As Tami says, if your not comfortable requested a second opinion or if you have trust in your oncologist ask him/her for a more detailed reason as to why no chemo. Best wishes Jule",

See you suffer? Ive been there, my dad had cancer and he did the exact thing you are talking about doing....DENYING it, he would not go to the doctor even and then by the time he finally did it was too late he was consumed with the ugly, nasty beast and there was nothing anyone could do...I was a full grown adult when this happened...I quit my job and stayed home with him because that is what he wanted....He was blessed to not have suffered like so many do....I lost my dad within 3 wks of him being offically dx'd....I was with him holding his hand when he died....I wouldnt change those last weeks or moment for anything in this world, but let me tell you the anger I felt for a very long time after was almost debilitating!!!!! I was angry at my dad for doing that to me.....I kept praying and asking him WHY, why didn't he seek treatment so that I had him for longer??? Obviously I will never have an answer to that question..... I cant imagine being a young child and going through that....please dont do that to yourself or your children....you will and can get through this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! let others help, ask you kids to help. I know Im pretty gruff in my statements here and I know your scared silly, we all were/are, but to even consider purposely letting this happen to you and you family is unthinkable....",

I decided to paint and re-trim the living room.....everything looks so fresh and clean that its hard to believe its the same two rooms!!!!! Then I caught a nasty cold that has been going around so ended up on the sofa under a ton of blankets as I was freezing to death for two days!!! Most of that is going away now but Im still cold and have a cough left over... Hope all is well with you and that you are planning a wonderful holiday... We are either going to Boise, ID so that I can meet Davids family or staying home for our first real holiday together but we havent decided for sure just yet.... Hugs Jule",

Althea-I dont think the medical field takes it seriously enough either....my rad oncologist and his nurse are the ones that talked to me about it, but it was more the nurse than the doc and she was talking to me about it because she says she actually sees it week to week as the patients go through their rad treatment. She was wonderful, it would be nice for every docs office to have a head nurse like Lori. Kerry-I lived alone and worked full time through my bc journey, but for me I think mentally/emotionall I NEEDED to work...I work for the state here so benefits and time off are not an issue (THANKFULLY)...There were days that I had to drag my hinney to work and put on a stiff upper lip to stay once I got there but the thing that always got me going was the thought that once I got home I would be alone and then my mind would wonder to dark places...the night time was MORE THAN enough time for those thoughts, so I pushed through work daily....I often wonder if my attitude might have been a little less tight about working if I had known how severely the fatige was going to hit me once it finally caught up with me, but Oh well, its done and in the past now so I continue to plug along and I really feel that over time (if I slow down when I first begin to feel the burn out coming) I might actually get back to a more normal level. This is such a wonderful thread, I really appreciate you starting it Mary.....hopefully as we each progress through the stages of this journey we can help each other with what we each have learned.

Since my last posting Davids daughter has finally given in and contacted him so we will see where that goes...He and I had been out playing around fishing a couple of weekends ago and I had taken some really good pictures of him. He sent one to her and for some reason that seemed to put a crack in the wall between them..Im hoping it is because she sees how happy he is and that things will continue to improve between them as he says they have always been very close. I think part of the issue is that she lives with his ex as her husband is in the military. I think maybe David's ex is alot of the issue betweent he two of them.... He moved to my home as we were 250 miles apart, but we are looking to start over completely so plan to begin looking for our own home to purchase so I understand what you mean about selling both homes and picking out your own.....We have had discussion on the feelings that moving into someone elses home causes so think I can understand what you are saying about coming behind another woman.

I dont know your age but that also will be a factor in your oncologists reasoning if they recommend chemo. Im sorry that you are here and in these shoes but this site will be alot of help for you.....Let me suggest that you take someone with you to your appt, make a list of questions to ask then have that person write the answers.

Mary-as Leaf said, soft, gentle massage directly on the area...I found it worked better after I had warmed my breast with either a shower or a heating pad....once the original soreness went away I started applying more pressure to the hard lump like the therapist showed me and within about 6 wks the hematoma was gone. I only went to the thereapist because the radiologist oncologist wanted to be sure the hematoma was gone before starting rads...said that in his opinion the less matter to beam through the better the treatment would be.

Hang in there..it does get better..Im two 1/2 yrs out now and looking back it doesnt really fell like it all happened to me...of course I still worry tons and get extremely anxious a few weeks before my 6 month follow ups but I find it does get easier as time passes.

It sounds to me like the sugery that is being talked about is basically a lumpectomy with sentinal node biopsy. The lumpectomy is to remove the lump and a margin area around the outside of it and the SNB is where they inject dye and follow it to the first set of nodes it shows up in then test them to see if there is any bad cells in them. They injected the radio active stuff and the blue dye a couple of hours before my surgery while I was still awake but I was medicated with Valum (spelling?) so wasnt as nervous as I normally would have been.... Dont be afraid to tell them right up front that you need something to help with the nerves & worry....this is an extremely stressful time for you and it is important that you get rest while you heal from surgery....I found that the meds dont take everything away but helped me cope with the stress of all the waiting for tests results..that is what seems to be the hardest part of this journey...

Try to take things one step at a time...try to take someone with you to appts IF (and only IF) this comes back as breast cancer then you will want to have a pair of ears with you since it will be hard for you to hear and understand anything past the initial words....also write down questions that you might have or take a tape recorder and record the conversations with your doctors if you have to go further with this. The next things Im going to say are ONLY in case this comes back \"c\".....normally if chemo is in your future it comes first, then radiation if it is needed, then possibly horomone therapy if the bc is er/pr positive.....but the hardest part is like I said...the waiting for test results is AWFUL in the greatest term of the word....I just about drove myself crazy researching and waiting. As far as your mom, thats a hard choice. I didnt tell my mom until after I had the initial biopsy done and it took me a bit to tell her that it was cancer when I got the results but she was my rock through everything. Im the only girl out of 5 kids so she and I are really close....it was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do but I live in the same town she does and do spend quite a bit of time with her so decided I had better tell her so she had sometime to get use to the idea if things turned out badly.

Although I dont believe having these types of diseases cause cancer I do believe that the particular one that I have aided in my cancer growing rapidly and led to my discovery of the tumor.. A friend of mine recently wrote an article in regards to the disease that both she and I have....she was able to have conference calls with some of the countries research doctors who actually responded via emails as well and gave thier permission for her to quote them. The disease I have is called Pernicious Anemia-it is a B12 defficency....at dx I had to take high doses of injected b12, which is what I believe made the tumor grow large enough for me to find....I stopped taking those shots as it scares the crap out of me now, but so far I have been able to control the deficency with taking a daily pill....my system no longer obsorbs b12 from foods and when the b12 gets too low it causes sever neropathy in my hands. If anyone is interested in the article I mentioned above, let me know and I will post it...there is alot of good information in it. Best wishes Jule",

Im assuming that your girlfriend is young correct??? and Im assuming that RS=26 is the oncotypedx score you are referring to with your question??? This is a very personal choice when you fall in the grey area like this and you are correct in saying that it is about a 50% split on the decision... The two of you will have to talk intently with her doctors as well as take her family history into consideration when making this decision....but most of all \"SHE\" herself will have to decide because she is the one who will have to live with it in her heart and possibly with the things that might be long term side effects to using chemo as a treatment... Alot of people say to ask your team of doctors what they would recommend is you were his wife, daughter or other family memeber and sometimes that helps too..

There are lots of things to help you and your doctors make the choices that are the best for you....I would hightly recommend the OncotypeDx testing...this is done by sending a bit of your tumor to a company in California that does testing to see if chemo would even be of help for you. I had this and got a test result of 12 which is in the low range so chemo would not have been of much help to me....I was 46 at dx...you menopause situation will also be taken into consideration as well...I was pre meno at dx, but have since has a hysterectomy to help fight the estrogen level.

It is possible that the original measurements arent as firm as believed...my docs actually told me that they can only get an estimated guess but to expect a little smaller or a little larger at surgery. Mine started with clinical measurement at 2.0cm but was acutually 2.4cm at surgery...I only had a 2 wk wait between biopsy dx and surgery but was I was still worried that it had actually grown in that short time since I found the lump myself and found it hard to believe that I was that same area of breast daily in the shower and it just suddenly appeared. I had myself believeing that my tumor was extremely rapid growing.... So try to enjoy the positive steps that you take and not go to the other side of things..... \"ITS SHRINKING, ITS SHRINKING YA!!!!!!!!!!!\"",

When I started my bc journey 18 months ago and asked about the ovary removal my onco said it was more common in Europe and isnt or wasnt par for standard care here yet.... If I were both of you I would approach it not as a question but a request if it is really something you want done, but be sure to investigate the se's that come along with it.. Jule",

The lead node picks up the dye (sentinal), but there are others that potentiall lead to different pathways so they also will pick up the dye...he said that they remove any and all that show dye color as there can be more than just one sentinal.....he explained that it doesnt mean they are infected, which is obviously true as in my case...there are many many women here who have had more than one removed to have the very same results...

I guess we just have to stop looking back...be thankful that it was found and deal with whatever we need to do to be sure that we get through this....

I have a follow up with my primary in August for high cholestrol issues so will be visiting with her on this one as I really think that maybe the ortho doc was right years ago when he said he thought I have rumatoid(sp?) arthritis....Ive looked as some of the syptoms and things pretty much match up.

Well, gotta run its a 3 hr drive to where the game is in Spokane so want to get a few things done at home b4 heading there.... Hugs to all Jule",

If you dont know how to boot to safe mode, all you have to do it do a restart from your shutdown screen....as soon as the screen goes black start tapping on the F8 key on the top row of your keyboard....that will bring you to a screen that has a listing for different things......#1 is normally safe mode and generally already highlighted, but if not, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to put the highlight on Safe mode and press enter.... This will bring you to destop screen like normal but the icons will be larger, a few missing and such, then a screen will come up and you need to click yes on it.......once you click that screen run the scanner.....

Anyway, I need to get ready for work, but wanted to post when I saw that my first one the other day is in cyber space somewhere.... Hugs Jule",

At first I was angry at him for not seeking medical attention when he first started feeling crappy, but as time as gone by I realized that he had watched and taken care of multiple family members who went through treatment and he made HIS choice to spend the time we had together with quality instead of being ill from treatments that werent going to change the outcome to begin with.... Its a very individual choice and no matter how hard it is I will ALWAYS support someones decision to do or not do treatment.... For myself when the time comes to choose Im not really sure what I will do but I do know that I under no terms want to be a burden on my family or for them to have the memories of suffering... Im sorry I dont post much then come into your conversation and write a huge post but I do read each day and keep all of you in my thoughts... Hugs Jule",

After our divorce he divorced the kids too basically...as with you Cathi, I never spoke bad of him and over the years both kids made up their own minds that he was and is an A$$. So much so that when my daughter got married a couple of years ago she had someone else walk her down the isle....in ways it was justice to me to see my ex sitting in the front row with family instead of being the father the way he should have been...I was a little worried he was going to be an A$$, but he just sat there an scoulded the entire time...left as soon as he could. I personally think he only came because his mother insisted...Ive always been on decent terms with the ex-in-laws so the kids have always had a relationship with his side of the family without him. Well David is getting (hopefully) his last infusion this morning and will meet with the docs about the next step to take...it is absolutely amazing how well this thing is healing...they wanted to leave the pick line in for about 10 after its completely healed but he is going to ask them to remove it because the arm it is in has been swelling.

We had a very nice day... Then my daugther and her 3 little ones came to stay the night with me so the kids and I have been cuddling this morning and playing games on the play station... Hope everyone has a lovely day, Im going to spend some time in my flower gardens as I did buy some more flowers to plant yesterday... Hugs Jule",

I bought some creeping Phlox in several colors yesterday as I have decided I want to plant ground cover benneth my roses, 1) to help keep moister in the ground, 2) to help keep weeds down and 3) because that will put color in the beds for the entire season. Im on a search for other ground covers that bloom so am sure I will be back buying plants again later this afternoon... As you can see I really enjoy my flowers...I have 3 rose beds that have about 45 roses between them. Jule",

Karen-you are correct, it is about 6 hrs from here to Seattle....I live about 20 miles north of Walla Walla in a little small podunk town that I grew up in and still love. Im sorry I didnt read more but do remember that several of our ladies are going on trips that sound wonderful!!!!!! Nancy-hope you are making progress with the insurance company, all that denial stuff is a bunch of crap!!!!!!!!! We pay our premiums and chances are will never use them in our lifetime so those companies are making money hand over fist and act like the ones of us that do have to use the insurance for larger medical expenses are taking it right out of their hands!!! CRAP!!! CRAP!!!! CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im sorry your having such awful headaches Lisa.....Ive never had migranes but I hate regular headaches so definately know I would REALLY hate those!!!!! I believe you are also the woman with the BEAUTIFUL daughter...she looks like a barbie doll!!!!!! Ok, enough for now...I promise to read more in awhile and reply to each one of you but I need to get a bite to eat as I didnt have time for lunch today (like I couldnt stand to loose a few lbs!!!!) but my tummy is growling...

Welcome back...Im a recent newbie to this thread and have enjoyed it tremendously. Does your son know about the Tucannon Lakes? It is in the foot hills of the Blue Mountains...there is a lake there committed to flyfishing for trout...our agency stocks it and patrol it pretty heavy so that fly fishermen get a fair shot at the lakes....Its probably a little further than he would want to ride on his bike...from Walla Walla it would be about 50 miles one way, but if he likes to camp it is a wonderful place for that as well... Do you ever travel over to Walla Walla to visit him? If you ever do please let me know, I would love to meet a sister!!!!! Will read and post more a little later as Im heading to Tri-Cities for a day of shopping with my mom... Hugs to all of you Jule",

Ive had a tremendously busy week and was a tired girl this morning so slept in for a bit, if you can call 7:30 sleeping in!!!!! But it is bright and sunny so thought I would have my morning coffee here with you all... Although I did have my first cup outside on the deck a bit ago....I love spring!!!!! There is this little squirrel that has been hanging around here for the past few years...I know it is the same one as he is missing on of his from paws (poor little guy), he joins me on the deck when I am out there for his morning peanuts....If I dare forget his peanuts he squabbles and squacks at me until I get them and if I leave my coffe out there he is drinking it when I go back!!! Goofy little guy!!! Spent the day with mom yesterday. We drove to Tri-Cities (50 miles away) to do a little shopping and meet up with two of my brothers and their wifes for lunch...was a fun day....was even nicer as the rain only seemed to happen whenever we were inside.... Today I have tons of stuff to do!!! The dreaded housework of course and I want to spend more time outside in the rose gardens, they are still looking kind of yukky....have some car issues to deal with too...my car has a dead battery so need to charge that (dont drive it very often in the winter as I also have a truck that I love), sons car has a flat tire, so need to get that off and to the repair shop as he is out of town for awhile now and not sure when he will be back... Went out to my little brothers a couple of evenings ago, boy do I wish I had a video camera!!!!! My 14 yr old nephew and his friend are having steers in the local FFA here and they were delievered the other day....he called and wanted me to come see them and watch how \"well\" he knows how to handle a cow.....he was walking along leading this cow and the next thing I knew the cow was running and Rob had turned around to see what was going on, the cow running towards him startled him so he was running backwards with the lead rope still in his hand, needless to say the cow ran him over....it was hilarous, just like a cartoon!!!!! Afterwards I asked Rob why he didnt drop the lead rope so the cow would go on its own...he said he didnt think about that!!!! Mind you this cow is about 300 lbs....Then my little brother stopped by for a few mintues last night...I asked him how the cow thingy was going and he said \"I truely think me, Rob and Chris are all now trained to lead\"....seems they should have boughten smaller cows :) Judie-I would love to visit, let me know when you are in my area and we will get together....Karen, you too, if you ever get this way let me know.....Walla Walla is getting pretty well known for its wines here, I have never done a wine tour but it would be fun.... Well, I have tons of stuff to do so better quit playing around....I hope you all have a lovely day!!! Jule",

We are only 1/2 was through our contract period and they have spent tons of money that wasnt expected and the fuel price is throught the rood here so have to re-calculate things to see where we stand......

I am so looking forward to meeting Judie and Devin Thursday for dinner and if things work out right we might even get to go fishing together over the weekend....Im normally on her side of the mountains with David on the weekends but he has been here all week and likely to be here over the weekend as well.... Life on that front is going wonderful.....we are happy as two peas in a pod  and have started actually discussing wedding bells, but not in the real near future,  just discussing it for a little further down the road. But on the bad side of things that have been keeping me so busy......my boss was dx'd with protrate cancer 3 wks ago so I have taken on alot of his responsibilities here in the office as well as doing work in the field as the fish runs are huge this year so lots of outdoor work....but anyway, my boss came in the other day and said that they found something in his upper femur in one of the scans...they did more testing and today he told me that they are going to do something called an \"open bone biopsy\" and that if it is in his bones they dont think it is protrate cancer, they think it is a different cancer as the prostrate cancer pathology came back as very slow growing.... As you all know Im holding my breath for him and praying that it isnt anything more than arthritis, but the doctors are all telling him they are sure it is more than that Im going to steal Sue's rant now.......I HATE HATE HATE BOOTFACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ive read each and every post on the last 5 pages since thats how far behind I was....I remember lots of things going on for all of you but cant put names to things going on so will just close by saying..... Welcome to the new ladies, always glad to have more sisters!!!!! I hope anyone that is having a bad time right now is doing better and those who are doing well continue to do well.

I have weighed myself with clothes, without clothes, before eating, after eating and I ALWAYS get one or two pounds difference.... The thing I find funniest is that I have weighed myself naked before a shower, then again right after showering and find that I am 5 pounds heavier after showering, but I think I have that figured out....I have really thick hair and I think it is water weight in my hair after my shower...

Have any of you had experience with spider bites??? David got bitten on May 13th, it looked like it was healing and normal for the first few days then it swelled huge and puss pockets started to form on the skin...he went to the doctor Monday, May 28th and took the antibiotics and steroids that they prescribed but the moment he ran out of meds it swelled huge again, moving farther up his wrist and arm as well as many more pockets and is now broken open and seepy...yesterday he went back to the walk in clinic and they gave him a shot in the fanny and a different kind of antibiotic.....this morning it is WAY WAY worse!!!!! I tried to get him to go to ER instead of this crappy walk in clinic but he thinks he should wait another day to see if this new stuff is going to work....What do you ladies think??

David volunteerily went to ER Friday evening....when he got home from work things had progressed to a really nasty state!!!! We got in there and they called a orthopedic specialist in because they thought the infection was in the bone and tendon of his finger....nope not there thankfully....they did a culture and started him on iv meds every 6 hours (so if this makes no sense, Im sorry, I really tired) we did the 6 hour, around the clock thing until this morning...the culture came back yesterday and he has mrsa in a rarer form..they said about 1 in every 10,000 cases...this one is a doooooozy!!!!! it does well with a med for a day or two they gets resistant to it...this morning the changed meds and are putting in a pick line tonight at 7...this med is an every 12 hr so not quite such a pain in the tushy. They are setting us up with an appt tomorrow with a doctor from the Infectious Disease Center in Seattle because they are baffled as what to do further here to kill the infection and heal this wound.... Then to top it all off my son calls this morning and is on his way to the er because he woke coughing blood....just talked to him a bit ago and they are sending him for a chest xray because they have no idea what is causing this to happen..... When it rains, it pours....now Im REALLY scared to go to my follow up visit with the onky Friday Im not sure how much puter time I will have this next week or two but will try to keep you posted as things progress(hopefully for the better here!!!!!) I feel like a walking zombie so am going to try to get a quick nap before Davids pick insertion and infusion at 7 pm. Thanks for all your thoughts and prayers!!! Jule",

We figure the little bugger was in the spray handle as we had stored the container in the garage over the winter.....after that we went salmon fishing and that is where they think the staff infection came from....they said that everyone has staff and it just takes something to set it off.....the spider bite had festered and was open, even though he worn a bandage on it the goop from cleaning the salmon we caught started the staff and the next thing we know its what they are calling \"the super bug\".... The meds are still working well..he is on the 12 hr iv's still....he was told yesterday by the nurse that this drug is only usable for a 10 day run and he only has 3 days left of use after today so hopefully they will put him on a pill form so its not so rough on him.....

The quilt she is referring to is one that I made with the help of the ladies in our yahoo group when Val was dx'd the last time and going through a hard time with treatment. Im thinking it would be nice if everyone would say an extra prayer at the time of the services on Thursday for her...she will be missed more than she will ever know. thanks jule",

Jane-sorry to hear of whats been happening for your family.... Lisa-if I were to be faced with one of those guys in the pic I would RUN!!!!!! My David is 6' 1\" and about 180 lbs. He's one of those no butt guys too, but I think what he has is extremely cute! The poetry you ladies have posted and written is wonderful!!!! Judy-Where are you?????? I know I miss alot of you when I post and Im sorry, but we all know how that goes.... I have a 6 month follow up with onco the 29th and am starting to feel the stress level climbing....I skipped my last mammo so I know he is going to insist this time and it scares me silly as everytime I have one of those nasty things it lands me in surgery....I just wanna move forward and I cant do that if something shows up everytime I have testing....I think the head in the sand is a great place to be!!!!! Well anyway, enough of the whining, wish me luck for my appt and ensuing tests as I dont think I can talk him out of them this time....and I know I really shouldnt for my own sake.....sure makes me understand why some of you ladies choose to do pbm's....

When I approached these two issues they said: You dont have to know baseball, you just gotta stand out there on the pitchers mount, smile, wave at the fans and throw the ball, the catcher catches it then runs it out to give me as a momento.

I hope you all are able to plan a visit like that as Im sure you would all have a blast....only rule is: PICTURES ARE A \"MUST\", so that those of us that dont live near enough to join you all can see what you all did while your there.... Val-how ya doing with the nerves? I didnt see you on much over the weekend so hope you kept yourself busy.... Hugs Jule",

Libby and I have gone a walk each night and I find that she urges me to be more active so I love her silly!!!!!! She is sooooooo much better than getting a puppy.....I got her from a family with young children that had a job transfer and couldnt take her because they were moving to the city....Im so glad I did this!!!!! She loves my grandchildren and that is a MUST for me as they are here often...she loves to play frizzbee....chase sticks whatever but when she's tired....boy is she tired!!!! flops down and tucks in for the rest of the evening right beside my recliner until I go to bed then she wonders into the bedroom with me and sacks out on her pillow next to my bed.. David, my 5 yr old grandson discovered that she LOVES to play tug-o-war with him so he says he's happy that I have Libby. Its about 75 degrees out and I just came in for a drink...I have mowed my yard, pulled weeds, fixed a spot on the house where birds were planning to make their nest (NOT), planted some pansies and of course played with Libby....but I had better get back out there as I want to take advantage of the weather as it is forcasted back to rain on Monday :(. Hope everyone is having a nice Saturday. Jule",
