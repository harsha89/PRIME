I am not taking anything now except for the occasional Aleve that my onc said was fine because it is only once or twice every 3 weeks.  I do have  oxycodone but don't feel like I really need it at this point.",

I am scheduled for a MUGA scan just to check things out, my last one in September was was good and MO also is checking my thyroid. I am convinced that it is from having rads and chemo together since it started 2 days after treatment. Any ideas?
