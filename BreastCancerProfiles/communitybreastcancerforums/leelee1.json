I am getting anxious. The nurse called the lab today and was told the pathologist is still \"looking at it.\" She told me maybe tomorrow. Doc is looking for either Pagets or even skin cancer. How long do these biopsies take???? I'm trying to remain calm but initially they told me I would probably get results this past Monday. Log in to post a reply",

They must be doing additional tests. I've read a few posts about women getting results back as quick as 24 to 48 hours so it had me questioning what else they were looking at. Thanks again!!",

She did say that it could be pagets or maybe even skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. She did feel that if it was either, it was early grade/stage and could be treated. She also did an ultrasound before the biopsy and didn't see anything in the breast. So I guess thats good. I am nervous. My breast on the day of the biopsy was so swollen and was beginning to leak a little fluid. The itching is bad today all over the breast. I feel like itching precedes deep throbbing pain so I may be in store for that later. I should know biopsy results on Monday. Thanks to those of you who posted a reply. I am checking this board constantly.",

Recent mammo and ultrasound showed skin thickening in the area where I'm having deep throbbing pain and itch. I see breast surgeon tomorrow. I can't stop googling! Does this sound similar to anyone diagnosed with breast cancer? Mammo was rated brad 4. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
