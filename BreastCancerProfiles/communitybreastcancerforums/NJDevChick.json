I just can't believe they just think it is a fatty lump.  Also, I just picked up my report and the radiologist classified my fibrodenoma (the smaller lump) as BI-RADS 3, saying it was the choice if my breast surgeon wanted to remove it (its 1 cm X 0.6 X 1.5 so it is small, so if they don't remove it they want to check it again in 4-6 months to make sure nothing has changed.  I probably have caused half the pains I have been feeling by all the pocking and prodding I do on top of the stress I feel, why can't I just let things go, I wish I was carefree lol!   carpe-I am going to ask the breast surgeon next month about that...I feel I will never be able to \"fully \" let it go unless it disappears or is removed.  I do feel though that it wouldn't be \"that\" free moving if it was truly something, and it definitely doesn't feel \"as hard\" when I push it sitting up rather than laying back and it pushing against my rib cage. ",
