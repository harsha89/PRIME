But with that sad the cyst I went in for...they never touched, they say its just a cyst but had nothing done... It's a large cyst. Sore. Almost golg ball size just below the surface. They said at the time they would try to get it if they could...but did not. So now I have this big cyst still hanging around. And now what? I called my GP and they said if it was B9 I'm ok. But I feel like I should be doing a follow up or something with the cyst. Right? They also said I have really really dense breast. I'm thinking of getting a specialist, but I'm surprised after weeks of this, I'm sort of left in the wind now to figure this out. Is this normal?",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2012 07:50AM - edited Dec 10, 2012 07:51AM by JMo33 I was waiting on core biopsy. What started out as just going in for a cyst and fine needle to reduce the cyst and it turned into you have a complex cyst....which turned into its not a cyst at all but a mass. The testing showed I have really dense breast...full of cysts. And this mass. They totally ignored the cyst and went after the mass. The core biopsy was not fun, they had a really hard time and hard to switch the needle thing twice as my density would not allow the needle to inject. But they finally got it after a bunch of pushing and pulling and a \"omg this is the first time we have ever had the needle not go in. \" and they were talking sending me for a surgical biopsy and lucky for me they finally got it. I'm all bruised, and sore, and my cyst is still bugging me, but the mass was the issue and they were pushing me through testing fast. . . But with that said, I just got the call, no cancer, and in my bursting out in stress relief tears I forgot to ask what it was. So I will get that shortly, but no cancer is a good call. But I learned I have lots of cysts, a mass, and very extremely dense breast so I'm going to be watched more, and because of family history...the 3d mammograms. I'm relieved, but part of me was also very sad...because I know out of all the woman at the screening center...many were getting a cancer call today. I was lucky today, I wish and pray others are as well.",

I Went in for yearly, they found a cluster...sterotaticbiopsy, ALH+ questionable. They sent me for an MRI, and setup surgical biopsy in May, found a mass with MRI and now I have an MRI.biopsy tomorrow. The only thing I don't have in my hands are all the path reports over the last few weeks....everything Is happening so quickly. I think having Cancer currently in a sibling has heightened my fear levels by ten fold. I Have good doctors, whom I trust, the one path report I do have I received after I talked with my doctor I think waiting to talk with them is key. prayers to you. When it's to much minute by minute, try not to think far ahead.",
