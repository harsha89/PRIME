    "Content": "Homesickblues wrote: Hello all, My name is Rachel and I'm 20 years old. I have pretty large breasts and have been plagued with bad skin for years. I have hidradenitis suppurativa which was much worse a few years ago and I almost never get lesions under my breasts anymore, but I'm pretty scarred. Anyway, a few weeks ago I developed kind of a red rash on the top right side of my left breast that appeared in two kind of blotches. I'm a pretty big hypochondriac so when I googled what it could be, IBC was the only thing that came up. After two days of panic, the splotches kind of just vanished. However, last night, they returned almost a month later. They itched last night but today they don't and I think they're kind of fading again. I have no other symptoms: no warmth, no remarkable breast size change, no pain. I was scared about peau d'orange, but I have noticeable pores on both breasts, so I don't think I have that either. Sometimes I get a shooting pain, but I'm also PMSing right now, so that's pretty normal. (I don't think the rash is menstrual related... As it came up last month during ovulation). I guess my question is... Does this in any say sound like it's typical of IBC? I do have a family history of breast cancer- my mother's mother had it. My family isn't that wealthy and although we have insurance, I'm terrified of how much doctors appointments for this would actually get covered. Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
