Meanwhile, I thought id share my story here to get some feedback and just get a load off my chest (and possibly get some advice). Im 28 years right now and back in 2009, I was diagnosed with a fibroadenoma in my right breast (detected by a doctor during an annual physical exam). I became more aware of aches and pains and later the same year, I was diagnosed (ultrasound) with fibrocystic disease- having multiple cysts in both breasts. At the time, some doctors said I didnt need a biopsy, the ultrasound was good enough to prove it was a fibroadenoma while others said the best thing to do was to take it out. I decided to leave it in and monitor. Its been a few years since and nothing really changed. I did get ultrasounds done regularly to monitor it. Two years back I moved to another country (courtesy: marriage) and started going to a new doctor. She insisted that I should get a fine needle biopsy done on my fibroadenoma. I did and the results confirmed that it was in fact a fibroadenoma. During this ultrasound guided needle test, the doctor saw two more fibroadenomas at the 1 'o clock position in the same breast. However, she said a needle test wasnt required and they looked like typical fibroadenomas...plus since i had one, i was likely to have more in the same breast. She told me to come back in a year and we could see whether the fibroadenoma had grown or changed and we could consider excision then. The year went by sooner than i thought...and i went for my ultrasound yesterday. The results have scared me: while the old fibroadenoma has not changed in size or position, I now have a total of 4 in the same breast! Furthermore, previously, the doctor had detected 2 fibroadenomas at the 1 o clock position but now the 1 o clock position appears to be clear and I have 3 (2 o clock, 4 o clock and 6 o clock). As always, multiple cysts detected in both breasts: 4 cysts in the right breast (couple with 4 fibroadenomas) and 6 cysts in the left breast! I called my doctor in panic. However, she says thats its not unusual to have multiple fibroadenomas. She also said needle tests werent required and she was pretty confident that the ultrasound report shows benign fibroadenomas. I also discussed whether all these crazy growths increased my risk for cancer...and she said no. However, Im just confused. I dont know if i should insist on more tests or take a hiatus for 6 months to a year, as she recommended. I also have trouble believing this doesnt increase my chances for breast cancer. Therefore, I thought id share my story here....get your opinion on this. There are people on this board who have gone through similar situations and taken tough decisions. Please let me know what you guys think! p.s: no breast cancer history in my family. however, my 30-year old sister in law was diagnosed with breast cancer right after she delivered her first baby and her experience has petrified me!
