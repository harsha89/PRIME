    "Content": "mruru wrote: Hi everyone, I have recently been tested for the BRCA1 mutation and have tested positive as a carrier for the mutation. My family has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer which is why I was tested for the mutation. Going forward with the process, I am looking to have a prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction in the near future to greatly decrease my risks of developing breast cancer. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations of surgical oncologists/plastic surgeon pairs in the greater Columbus area, especially at the Stefanie Spielman Comprehensive Breast Center. I am interested in a flap prophylactic mastectomy, so if anyone has a referral for a surgeon who completes this procedure that would be even better. Lastly, for anyone who has completed the procedure, approximately how long was your recovery period/what was it like? Thanks so much for all of the guidance and God Bless! Log in to post a reply",
