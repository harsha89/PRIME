Snow?!!  I'm sure glad that our winter is over.  The sea must be beautiful.  Recently, a US government panel recommended changes to mammogram screening policy.  This policy change has been very controversial in the US.  If you have not found some information about it yet, here's a link on this website that summarizes it... www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/new_research/20100105.jsp I am not a doctor, so this is only my opinion based on being a younger patient.  At minimum, I believe that if a younger woman goes to a doctor with a family history of BC, a lump, and/or a finding on some other type of imaging, then we should be evaluated with everything necessary.  So, that is why I said I'd find a new doctor.  (I'm passionate about this subject, does it show?) I hope that you find some answers soon.  I'm sending more warm wishes your way...",

This is a scary time, and the waiting is very difficult.  Please don't beat yourself up or feel stupid.  I'd bet most people have sometimes slacked off a bit with our own medical care.  I have. I would seriously think about getting a new GP.  If a doctor ever told me that he didn't believe in mammograms, I would find a new one.  Fast!  Also, have you talked with your gyn about the ultrasound results?  It is possible that he would be more helpful after knowing the results of your U/S. Many lumps are benign.  Even so, a second opinion with a new doctor might help give you some peace of mind. Warmest wishes.",
