In response to your comment, I was diagnosed with bc in early 2004 (age 40) , early stage II, 2cm tumor with no lymp node involvement.  I originally decided to have a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy eventhough my grandmother, aunt and stepsister (who got diagnosed 4 months before me at age 31) all had bc.  My grandmother passed at 56 (1978) and my aunt, her daughter passed at 38 (1988).  When I first was diagnosed it was so overwhelming I really didn't know what I was doing or wanted to do. Anyway, in early 2004 I had my lumpectomy, followed by six months of chemo and 7 weeks of radiation.  During my treatment, my sister tested positive for the BRCA1 gene.  I knew that I would also probably test positive, but I decided not to have the test until I was almost finished withi my treatment.  At the end of 2004, I tested positive for the BRCA1 Gene.  It was very devastating even though I was expecting it.  I have a 10 year (7yrs old at the time) daughter and also a son who I am very worried about because of this. Fortunately I have a wonderful husband who wanted me to get everything possible done that I could to prevent any cancer coming back.  In February 2005 I first had a complete histerectomy, since this gene can also cause ovarion cancer.  A few months later, May, 2005 I had a complete mastectomy with reconstruction at the same time and in August of 2006 I had a minor readjustment to my implants. Now it is already the middle of 2008 and I am doing wonderful.  I feel good and knock on wood I am cancer free.  I plan on being here to watch my kids grow up and their kids grow up.  If down the road any cancer comes back I will have no regrets that I did not do everything possible that I could to stop it.  I plan on being here for a very long time.  I hope this info helps.  Good Luck. ",
