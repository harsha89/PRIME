I may have Theraspheres in June and would have to be off anyway. I will stay on Femara.  My problem is more emotional.  I feel like I am giving up on something that is working and if I start up again, it may not work.  I am scared that the cancer will grow and I will lose all the ground that I have gained.  How do you other ladies deal with these feelings?",

Gather the pictures, dump them in a pile, gather some good friends to sort into boxes for the two boys.  Mark the identify of the people on the back of the pictures  You can sit and lounge and help them with the names.  Order pizza delivery and have fun with it, laughing at the hairstyles and decor etc. 3.  Write just one letter to each boy telling them how much you love them and how proud you are of them. 4,  If you feel like it there a is book called \"All about me\" that can give the boys some well needed history about your side of the family (medical is esp. important) It is fill in the blank 5.  Hug them and enjoy them every day.",
