I guess it is human nature after reading there might have been something else that could had been of benefit for my survival to not feel twinges of hindsight. I bring this topic up as I have been hearing it from ladies all over in support groups and on these boards and want to express that I understand both the confusion of the studies and the feeling of desperation for those including myself, with high grade triple negative and some other aggressive breast cancers that offer fewer options. I knew from the start that i would need a BMX....I had no other real alternative as I am BRCA1 had already survived ovarian cancer. I am very happy that progress is being made for all of us and our children's futures..the fact is I had this conversation with my doctor 4 months ago, and he actually looked at me as if I pulled this out of my hat, when I have been reading about these studies in efforts to see if I would be eligible since there was some questions on my pathology that were never confirmed. So, for me and for some others I guess it is human nature to ponder and reflect and not unusual to wonder \"if I did enough\"....I don't have regrets, as there were no other options for me...I guess this is part of my healing. Thank you for your thoughtful reply...be well Lisa",

You know, every day we go through this cancer roller coaster....one day we read, Masectomy is equal to Lumpectomy, then we read Lumpectomy with radiation has a better survival. I am sure there are many ladies such as myself who had BMX, feeling good they were aggressive...then asked their Doctors if they should have radiation due to high grade of their cancer and were told NO as it is not the current protocol if node negative and you have a BMX or Uni Mastectomy....now we read radiation makes the significant difference in the two treatments showing a better survival .....well..after accounting for their exceptions in the studies they had noted such as what was not accounted for in the study....I am pissed and somewhat scared and let down. I had a triple negative high grade breast cancer....although I would have had a BMX anyway because I am BRCA 1+, I feel maybe I could have also benefited by some kind of radiation to the site...sorry ladies I am just venting and feeling a bit vulnerable right now....

I see you have done well...no recurrences since diagnosis...well done. There is actually a trial out there for single chemo use using A/C alone...the percentage of less than 1% bennefit would come from the Taxol in my case...I do believe it has to do with size of tumor -VS-bennefit.. Anyway...glad you have done well...Congrats! Lisa",

I was DX with TNBC in June, BMX in July with tissue expanders placed at the same time of surgery, chemo in August, now going for my TE exchange...I have very surreal moments where I still can't believe what just happened. It does get better, and once you start chemo you will charge through it. It is not easy, but it is doable, and we are all here for you and any questions or fears, you have....you can even rant or vent. That's great that your surgery is coming up soon, so you can get that done and move forward. I will include you in my prayers and send positive thoughts you way!!! Message me anytime if you have any questions... Lisa:)",
