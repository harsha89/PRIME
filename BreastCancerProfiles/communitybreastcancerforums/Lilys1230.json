I have no symptons at all, no lump, pain, swelling, etc. I'm awaiting my app at the clinic but am extremely anxious. I'Ve barely slept or ate all weekend as I can't get it out of my head. Actually can't wait to go to work tomorrow so I can focus on something. Is it unusually to be referred with no symptons Log in to post a reply",
