Also there is no chance I'm pregnant because I'm not sexually active) I have also noticed an indent on the bottom of the same breast. I think I feel lumps but I'm not sure what's normal or not because I've never done a self breast exam before. But I know that the indention and the discharge is definitely strange... Also pain in nipple region. Please help! Thanks!!! I feel like I am so young for this but you never know. Have a doc appointment on Tuesday, but would love some advice. Thanks!!!
