Because nothing about breastcancer ist pink or ribbonish...I understand, that there has to be a symbol, like there is one for HIV and other disease...but it is tooooooo much. And raising awareness for bc does not mean to wear a pink nailpolish with a ribbon on it. Just to get followers on a blog.  Just my two cents... Hugs",

My hair is still curly and I love it and most of the time I feel pretty normal, but my moods change a lot and then I start crying and can´t say why :-( I know, it´s the Tamoxifen and Trenantone and also the whole cancer thing, but I really don´t like this moments. Still I´m thankful for every day. I know, that I wouldn´t be here anymore without the treatments i got. In August 2011 there was this little voice in my head that told my I have to go to the doctor to check out this lump in my breast, because if i didn´t, I would never turn 30...",

Although the most of you are so many miles away, it really helps to read your posts. I still didn´t decorate, I just don´t feel the whole christmas-thing this year and I´m soooo tired, although I´m sleeping about 10 hours every night. And my next chemo is going to be next tuesday,I don´t think, I will feel better after this. It´s annoying.",

You don´t have symptoms and just 2 spots. The mother of a friend had bc and 3 years later a recurrence in the liver, they treated it and she is still NED after 10 years. It is possible. Please don´t give up hope. Hugs Moonflower",
