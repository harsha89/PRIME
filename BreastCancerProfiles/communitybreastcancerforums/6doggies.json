I agree with Fe Princess, you should tell your doctor that you want to know if you really do, it shouldn't be up to them to decide for you. Fe Princess, congratulations on your run, it's great to get back to the things that we enjoyed doing before our diagnosis. I was so excited to do step and not fall over my numb feet last week! Congratulations on your move as well and good luck, that is so exciting!",

I'm 47 and mine came back at 32, which is high. I was diagnosed with IDC on November 18, 2014, had lumpectomy on December 10 and started Chemo on January 23, 2015. My tumor was 1.7 with 2 out of 5 positive nodes, puts me at 2A.  Currently doing Chemo, then radiation, then hormone therapy, worried about reoccurrence.",
