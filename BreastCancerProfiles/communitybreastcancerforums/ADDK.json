I found Kadcyla very doable - brittle nails and runny dose from the Herceptin, only. Hoping for good results of your scan and wishing you all the best.",

I´m single, 56 years old, live alone and have a full time job that I love (worked through treatment), and (still) fit. I would really appreciate if other HER2+ girls would share their insight on what´s ahead of me. Did you have to quit your job or work part time? If so \u2013 at what point of time? How do you cope with day-to-day-matters? I have a large house and garden, and wonder when I will either need help or have to move. I know that we are all different and respond differently to treatment. Still, I would be grateful if you would share your experience with me. Thanks a lot!

I go to Herlev and have learned from experience that if you are really persistent it is possible to get the MOs to think a little outside the box and also speed up things - including scans. If you feel that you have the strength you could try to challenge \u201cthe system\u201d by being annoyingly persistent",

I´ve been on Herceptin on and off, and each time I start all over I get a runny nose, which lasts for about 5 months. After my second cycle of TDM-1 I started to have a little bloody nose, too (aka rupture of small blood vessels). I started Herceptin again about two months ago (every three weeks), and apart from the runny nose I have a bloody nose the first week after infusion. I hope you get a very long run on TDM-1 - it is a really doable drug compared to so many of the other treatments that we expose ourselves to.",

All clear. Yes, your cancer may spread to your brain, but not right now :-) I´m so sorry about your anxiety. Could you work on becoming a weirdo like me? I really never worry about scan results. What´s there is there, and my worries won´t change that, just make me miserable. Sending you gentle hugs.",
