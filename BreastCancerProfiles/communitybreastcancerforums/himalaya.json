For one year it grow big  7cm and started to pain, so i decided--well i need to cut it out. So i lost my breat and lymphnodes, 2 of them were  bad. Now im ready  for radiation, they will do 3 weeks for me. If you have something to tell me, im gratefull for that. I remember that i left forum long time ago because i was asking to many questions and that was suspicious for many of you...im sorry about that but i realy wanted to know  so many things, surgey was scary for me and i hope you forgive me that. If i will will feel that you reject me again, i will will leave the forum forever and never  talk to anymore. So, if you wanna share friendly, you are welcome! Thanks!
