Fast forward to her scheduled axillary nodes removal and my mom had not been feeling well for several days and her breast is warm, red and still very swollen. He wants to do surgery anyway-but colleagues advise against, so he removes the fluid, says it is a seroma and he really doesn't think there is an infection. Puts her on Cipro anyway for 7 days. That was on the 22nd.(culture show there was an infection) My mom is a very energetic on the go woman. She now sleeps in till 10 or 11 am., naps during the day and is miserable. She is running low grade temps. (99.2-99.8) and feeling generaly crappy! The dr's office has called and she told them she wasn't up to par but the redness has gone down some. (I don't think so at all) They are just worried about rescheduling her surgery. I don't get it! I am afraid she is going to go septic from this! My mom has never been sick in her life, and I hope this doesn't take her down. has anybody had an infection? How was it treated? Should I be pushing to get her seen again?

If you have a small lump (in case you have not seen any of my other posts- this is about my mom and her lump is a half a centimeter, they believe) is there still a chance that this cancer could be spread through her body? Could she have it in other places and not know it? I was thinking that since they keep telling her its very tiny that they would take it out maybe radiation and that would be it. But now somone has questioned whether or not if we know if it has spread anywhere else. How would we know that, and do they automatically do some sort of check to see that?

I wish you well for Monday! I wish I didn't have to wait so long now. I have been noticing things for a few months now but I thought I could wait until my regular mammo. Now I just want to know everything is okay. Its occupying my thoughts a lot. My newest discovery in the past 2 or so days is that my nipple is a lot fatter than the other one.

Anyway he mentioned Pagets, but said he did not think I had it. He referred me to a breast surgeon and said he would let them make the call as to biopsy or keep an eye on it. The peeling has stopped (for now- it comes and goes) but the crease and indentation are still there. The fact that this is new is why he wants me to see the BS.

It is for June 12th, I couldn't make it to the first one she tried to schedule so I have to wait a little longer, but thats fine. I am really curious as to what this is.  I don't have any of that peeling right now (actually for the past 4 days) but it has always come and gone(since November). It still itches off and on (not severe-just an itch) and I also have taken particular notice that my nipple now looks like a comma with a dent in it! (,) It really changed shape.And it is not as responsive as the other one. It stays a little flatter and doesn't get quite as erect.  I hope anyone else that has this oddness at least finds this to read, I can't seem to find anything on this \"exactly\". I find Pagets with the rashes and such, but not like this . I have tried looking up anything that has all the symptoms I have and the nothing matches it. GRB- any news yet on the exact dx? Alli- Wow, you, your mom and sister? Thats just awful! My mom was dx'd last year after not having a mammo for almost 10 years! She only went because I asked her to come with me so I wouldn't have to sit alone in the waiting room. Isn't that crazy! Then the week of her surgery my sister got a call back on her mammo telling her they wanted her to get an MRI. They ended up doing a biopsy right there.She was immediately scheduled for a lumpectomy. Turns out it was only a radial scar. But wow, last summer was interesting to say the least!",

I am thinking that if it were something dangerous it would only get worse and NOT improve??? I see my gyno in a couple of weeks so I am trying to keep it \"lubed up\" consistently to see if that takes care of it by the time I see him. I am due for a mammo at the beginning of June. Which of course marks a year since my mom's dx. (breast, but not pagets). BTW- I did see that email, and I DID think it was real. It was only upon further investigation that I found out it was some sort of sick scam/joke. Ughh....",
