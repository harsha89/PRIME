He told me he could give me neat scars and he did. I have wide excision. I have a small frame but I had medium sized breasts which took up my entire chest. I was diagnosed de novo with mets so I knew there was a high possibility of lymph node removal. That contributed to the scar on the right extending past my arm pit and, as 29 nodes had to be removed, that was the only part of my recovery that was really painful (apart from the extensive bone mets). After a year my BMX scars have almost faded and are barely noticeable but I do have little dog's ears under my arms which are also improving now that I can do stretches again. I would say it depends on the size of your breasts, the type and size of tumours (my right one was 10 cm and the left one was 2cm), and your body type. I think being small and slim helped with mine. The BS told me it would. So, I would sum all that up as only you can estimate. Perhaps a consult with a plastic surgeon might be a good idea to get advice on how the size of your breasts and body will impact on surgery and compare that with what your breast surgeon says. Obviously the PS will be looking for work but you can size that up by listening. My surgery only took 3 hours.",

On the left the tumour was only 2cm but on the right it was 10cm before it was discovered. But as soon as I saw my biopsy results and before I saw the BS, I knew that I would have BMX. My operation was on 2nd November, 2016. Not having to make the decision myself made it easier but I grieved the loss of my breasts for a long time. I chose not to have reconstruction because I was very ill and didn't want the operation to be any longer and I don't want to go back for more. I doubt whether I would have been a candidate for reconstruction anyway as I don't have any flesh to spare! I've now become used to it and, being slight of build, it's not terribly noticeable and I can dress to disguise it or, if I want to, wear my prosthesis bra. I'm ER+/PR+HER2- so chemo is not the treatment for me, hormonal treatment for life is my treatment but, if I'd had a choice of BMX and no chemo or conservation of my breasts with chemo, I would have chosen BMX.",

The right tumour didn't show up at all despite its size but the smaller left one caused a distortion of the breast, which alerted me just in time. I was given no choice but to have a Bilateral Mastectomy but, even if my left breast had not been involved, I would have insisted on a Bilateral anyway to avoid any risk of recurrence later in the left one. I chose no reconstruction to avoid risk of missing any signs of future recurrence. My operation was 9 months ago, I'm now accustomed to the new me, my scars are fairly comfortable and I rarely grieve the loss now. I mostly go flat as it's comfortable and it's possible to wear clothes that make it less obvious but, when I do want to wear clothes that fit better with breasts, I wear a prosthetic bra. It's quite heavy as the load is all on the shoulders but looks quite good to the observer. I hope this information is of value.",

Bear in mind that these are my thoughts and in all likelihood bear no resemblance to those of your friend. Firstly, if you haven't seen her in a year it's possible that there has been a change in her thinking during that time. Speaking for myself, a year ago I had been diagnosed for four months and until recently I've been in denial. I have a very confident, positive attitude but reality has dawned upon me that I will never be cured, that I will live with this disease until I die, either from it or from something else before cancer takes me. Because of my cancer I've had to move out of my home and into a small apartment because my husband and son work full time and our house is large with stairs. They travel for business so a lot of the time I have to look after myself which is impossible in a large house but just possible in the tiny apartment. Only just. My husband is past retirement age but has continued to work because we don't know what is in front of us financially. We may have to spend a lot of money to have a carer look after me if I progress. We live on a knife edge from scan to scan every three months to find out whether I'm still stable. Fortunately, so far so good but it's never out of the back of our minds. This is the difference between having curable disease and incurable disease. At Stage 2 you have every hope of remission or cure. At Stage 4 we will never be cured. Our hopes are always for stable disease and the very very best we hope for is regression but it depends on our prognosis, the site of the mets, the amount of mets and whether we are responding to treatment or whether treatment is at least controlling the disease. Your friend might not feel like discussing her breast cancer with anyone or perhaps with you because of fatigue, sickness or just plain being fed up with having cancer and not wanting to talk about it. Sweetie, the fact that you are both having chemo at the same time doesn't give you common ground when one is at Stage 2 and the other is at Stage 4. Also, at Stage 4 cancer has taken over our lives and has done so usually for a long time and the last thing we want to do is talk it over. We're either too unwell or we're looking for diversion from it. She also more than likely is no longer into going for coffee. A lot of us have stopped doing that. In my case it's because I have mets in my bones and I'm in a lot of pain and chairs at cafes are uncomfortable and leave me in worse pain for several days afterwards. Sadly, a lot of us can no longer drive. I can't because of the opiate pain meds I need. We have low white cell counts from our treatments and are told not to be in crowded places for risk of picking up an infection that leaves us in hospital. I've spent a lot of time considering your situation, Laurie and trying to express it carefully. This is only my take on it but I think it's probably how I might feel if I were this friend at the moment. I hope this helps you sweetie.",

About the WBC, I wouldn't worry too much after only one cycle.

I always have a two week break, with two blood tests a week apart, instead of one and I'm not the only one in that position. Some of us just tend to go that bit lower than others. And I would say the reason you got sick is, with a lowered WBC and travelling, you would have been more susceptible to picking up a germ or two. When I go anywhere that there will be more than a few people I wear a mask, especially around the time that my blood work is low and my oncologist approves of it highly. I'd suggest that if you intend to go anywhere you wear a mask to protect yourself from germs. When I wear mine people might glance at me and wonder but I've never felt embarrassed or had people stare at me and if they did I wouldn't care anyway!

I agree with Micmel on the value of keeping a journal to see the pattern of your thoughts and feelings throughout the Ibrance cycle. I find that when my blood levels go down, my spirits go down as well and things can look very bleak. Now, because I see the pattern, I know that's the reason. It doesn't stop me from feeling dispirited but it does explain why. I also live alone. I've had to move out of our family home and into a tiny studio apartment so basically, I live, sleep, cook and do everything in one room the size of a good hotel room. The reason I moved out is because my family home is very large and has dangerous stairs and I'm an invalid if I live there, needing help with meals and almost everything. My son is 29 and my husband works full time but they do visit me as often as they can. Because they have to travel for business, I have to manage alone although to tell the truth I really am not well enough. Sometimes at night I ask myself why I'm living like this when I have a lovely home and garden overlooking the sea, with a large, beautiful bedroom with sea views and I cry and feel homesick. I ask myself whether I'll ever be able to live at home again and I know the answer is no. The only solution to living in a cramped space like this is to find the money some day to buy me a small one or two bedroom apartment so that all my belongings are not on display. Still, I feel happy a lot of the time because this cancer is not going to demoralise me and break my spirit. I have my balcony garden to look at, lots of books and Netflix so that I can enjoy some movies and I just have to accept that this is my life, that I will never be the physically active person I used to be and I also have to accept help - something I've found difficult to do but I tell myself that I've given help to many people throughout my life and, although I might not like it, it's time to allow people to help me in return. Sorry, I got a bit carried away and I'm not complaining. It's just that, like Micmel, I'm making sacrifices for my family because of my family and I'm absolutely certain we're not the only ones living in less than ideal conditions. It doesn't seem fair; it isn't but that's how it goes. I am very very fortunate though that my son is my soul mate and on the days he can't visit because he's working, we \"talk\" on Messenger on Facebook and that my husband will come to see me after a long day at work if I need him. I'm so grateful I have that. Although I'm not a great fan of Facebook, I find it invaluable for keeping in touch with friends - either using Messenger or just having fun. ",

The worst part of being Stage IV with bone mets for me is that I'm not independent at the moment because of the amount of pain killers I need for the awful pain. Your friend might appreciate being taken out. On the other hand, she might find it painful sitting in a car. I take two cushions wrapped in plastic bags, one for each foot, to brace my feet against the floor of the car and I have one behind my back plus a neck guard and then I'm fine and we have a a (I think you in the US call them SUV) which is really comfortable with a soft ride so be prepared for her to not want to be driven or to take lots of cushions since she's in pain. Perhaps she might just like to sit outside with you for company but without talking. Take your lead from her but, yes, don't talk cancer. For me, I'm totally sick of it and just want to talk about normal things. I'm still me. I'm not defined by my illness. It's great that you want to help her because some of us find that the friends who helped in the early days drop away after about a year if nothing dramatic is happening and a fresh face would be great.

Katie and Rosabella.....I would bring up any concerns at all that I have with my oncologist. You have the right to ask and he/she won't know if you don't mention it. I too am very sorry you all have this to deal with and I send you all my love and thoughts.",

All they do is confuse the public and dlb is right. Oncologists say that BC, once metastasised is not curable. It is treatable. I was told there will be no such thing as what is usually termed as remission for me but, hopefully, we can bring the extensive bone mets I have under control. If this writer's cancer had metastasised and was still spreading, I'm pleased that she believes she is cancer free but I agree with dlb on that score as well. Sadly, she would be NED which doesn't mean remission or cured. saranoh...what a special daughter you are. No, it's not selfish to still want to talk to your mother. It's very thoughtful of you to seek opinions on it before you do and I admire you for that. Of course, it does depend on the sort of person your mother is and how she's coping with her diagnosis. At the moment she would still be in shock and disbelief. I wrote about this on another thread. I'll see if I can find it for you and re-post it here. If I don't re-post it, it will be because I can't find it. Basically, what I found was that, with a Stage IV diagnosis, you go through a similar process to that which you go through with grief: shock, disbelief, denial, anger and not necessarily in that order. You might be in more than one state at the same time as another. It takes a long, long time to get to the acceptance stage so you will need to understand that that's what your Mum (I'm an Aussie, I say Mum) is going through right now. That's just some background for you because she will seem distracted at times, partly or mainly due to feeling ill but also just the disbelief that this has happened. I have a 29 year old son and we're very close. He's always come to me for advice and he's my best friend so likewise I confide in him. I have been very ill for the past year. I was diagnosed Stage IV with bone mets a year ago but despite that we still talk about his problems because it's very important to me that I'm still his Mum and I intend to be there for him as long as there's breath in my body. I'd hate for him to feel he's burdening me if he talks to me about his problems. I encourage it and in that way nothing has changed. In fact, I find it takes me out of myself to have him talk to me. I don't want anyone to see me as being \"different\" now and I still encourage all my friends to confide in me the way they always have done; otherwise I would feel isolated and unwanted and I'd hate that. I would feel as though I'd been cast off and redundant and I'm far from that. In fact, having cancer has given me a wisdom that is beyond any I had before (says she, modestly haha). Perhaps you could broach this subject with your Mum. Tell her what you said here; that you will always be there for her, no matter what, and that you want to share this time in her life with her, then ask her if she feels up to still being your confidante because you still need her support and advice. I hope it works out for you. Hugs",

It was sharp, intense and much, much worse on moving. I had to lie completely still in bed and could not turn over onto my side.

As a Stage IV patient with extensive bone mets, diagnosed de novo (Stage IV from the beginning), my diagnosis was also a shock. Now, eighteen months later, I've worked through the various stages to acceptance. I think I have, anyway, it doesn't happen overnight. The truth sinks in very slowly, in stages. I was in denial for a long, long time and didn't look at the situation directly. If your wife appears to be doing this, my advice is to allow her to stay in Denial Land for as long as she needs to because it helps cushion the blow. Eventually, once she realises treatment is for the rest of her life, the reality of it will sink in bit by bit. The best advice I can give you is to take it one moment at a time. Not even one day at a time; one moment, because your moods tend to swing wildly at the beginning. Don't look too far into the future. The future is in your imagination and your mind can conjure up all sorts of worries that might or might not ever happen. Live completely and utterly in the present. Be kind to each other. Give each other space and give each other support as and when needed. There might be times when your wife needs you desperately to be there with her and there might be times when she wants to be alone. I cried a lot. If your wife does this let her. Tears are very healing. Sometimes she might need you for comfort and at others she might feel like a wounded animal and feel the need to be alone with her tears. I often go off on my own to have a little cry. My future is no longer the future I thought I would have. If your wife has the most treatable form that's obviously a good thing but you need to be prepared that treatment is forever. There is no time off for good behaviour with metastatic breast cancer. Treatments have side effects and it takes a while to adjust to them. More so, it takes a long, long time to adjust your mind to the fact that if the cancer is metastatic it is incurable. It can be highly treatable but, at this stage, treatment is for life. There will be lots of scans and doctors' appointments and she will need help with those. She will need you or a trusted friend to go with her to appointments to take notes because it's impossible to remember everything we're told at an appointment. But I return to my main belief that what works best at this stage is living in the present moment and refusing to think about what the future might hold. Thinking that it's best to be prepared for more bad news is not helpful. If you're given bad news you will cope better if you are emotionally stronger. Be optimistic and positive - you'll have that said to you a lot. If it's said by people who have never been where you are right now, it's a superficial bunch of words that are meaningless. If it's said to you by someone who is experiencing metastatic breast cancer it has deep meaning. It means live with the belief that all will be well, find anything you can that gives you moments of happiness and go with that, but believe with every fibre of your being that you will cope with this. Believing is different from just saying \"be positive\". This might sound strange at the moment but in time you will probably understand what I'm getting at. You will be given a lot of advice by well meaning friends and you'll hear the same words over and over. Certain diets will be suggested, certain foods are said to \"cure cancer\", people will say \"if there's anything I can do just let me know\". Ignore the first two but when it comes to the last one, take them up on it. Have a list in your mind of the things you need help with and delegate them. Take all the help you can get. If you don't have anything they can do for you right now, you might later. People generally mean it when they say they want to help, so let them. You asked for words of hope. There are a lot of women who have lived for many, many years with metastatic breast cancer. Especially the highly treatable kind. I expect to live until I die from old age. A word of advice....if it is confirmed that there is metastasis, have a look for the appropriate thread in this forum. There are threads for the kind of medication used and threads for the organs that are affected, just to name two. Join into the conversation on those threads, make yourself known. You will be welcomed with open arms, kindness and a lot of support and knowledge. I wish you and your wife strength, flexibility and love.",

I had 22 core biopsies performed, none of which produced any samples. I saw a breast surgeon, who told me that patients in that situation go either one way or the other. Some turn malignant, some don't. She was quite casual and referred me for the usual two yearly mammograms without (i now know) adding any mention that I had calcifications. I had absolutely no idea of the significance of calcifications and duly turned up for my mammograms every two years for ten years before I became seriously ill. Because every single one of my mammograms were reported as clear, breast cancer was the last thing on my mind. By 2015 I was unable to get out of bed I was so weak. I didn't make it to my 2013 or 2015 mammograms but self examination showed nothing. My breasts appeared perfectly normal and, anyway, I was too sick to walk outside, let alone go out. Suddenly in 2016 my left breast changed shape radically so we called a lab who would take blood from me at home. My CA 15.3 report showed a result of 784 and \"metastatic breast cancer\". My husband organised a morning of tests for me the next day and I was wheeled from one to another. I was in a very poor state. It was obvious immediately on ultrasound that my left breast contained only a 2cm ductal tumour but the right one was a mess. It contained a lobular as well as a ductal 10cm tumour plus activity in the sentinel node yet external appearances were completely normal. I can only think that the lobular tumour was hidden and the ductal tumour was hidden by the lobular tumour. I immediately had a bilateral mastectomy with 29 lymph nodes cancerous and removed. Bone scan showed extensive mets to the bones. My entire skeletal system is covered in mets so I was staged as de novo Stage IV. The tumours were 95% to 99% hormone positive so I'm taking Ibrance and Letrozole and will be doing so for the rest of my life. Quality of life isn't great because of pain and difficulty with mobility but my health has improved radically since treatment began. My advice to anyone who is diagnosed with calcifications? Follow up and keep following up even if your breast surgeon tells you it's unnecessary. If I'd been given the advice to have a bilateral mastectomy at the time, I certainly would have had to think hard about it but, with hindsight, I would have been healthy now with no sign of cancer in my body.",

I know my breast cancer is incurable but I've been told it's highly treatable and I believe that with every fibre of my being. I'm always positive about that. Other things in my life have thrown me off balance of late...those personal issues, but seeing the MO is just a routine for me. I see him every five weeks because I'm on a trial and I don't expect a lot of change. I will be starting on my twelfth cycle tomorrow, all going well, so it's, as I said, routine now. Fatigue and mouth ulcers are my main side effects but gelclair takes care of the mouth issues and I'm getting used to the fatigue and can just work through it most of the time. If I get too tired, I rest for a while. I find talking the most exhausting activity, strangely enough. It's because I tend to have brain fog, caused by Ibrance, Letrozole and high dose pain killers and sometimes I find I just can't project my voice or find the words I want. It's so much easier typing. Lynnwood.... as you would have seen my tumour marker was 1,200 one year ago and it's now well below half that. I trust Ibrance and Letrozole will eventually bring it down lower but they're slow working treatments. I've been told I could be on this treatment for years so I'm hoping I'll be like you and still be on it two years from now. It must be worrying to have your TM go up like that, though, and my thoughts are with you. My MO told me when my went from 390 to 520 that we will only worry if it keeps going up and stays up. Since then it's been zigzagging, so that can happen.",

I'm normally calm and positive about everything but last night at midnight I woke up crying and wondering what am I doing here? Why am I living in a one room apartment when I had a home and a life that was fulfilling. Yet I'm conflicted. There's no way I want to go home. The house is too big and turns me into an invalid again. At least in this tiny apartment I can look after myself. I guess yesterday was a tiring day, with the early oncology appointment and after those I'm always wired and take time to come down because it takes a lot of adrenaline to get myself through it and I have to wind down again after that. I sat up at midnight and wrote in my journal. I asked myself a lot of questions but I was going around in circles. I want to be here, I don't want to be at home, this apartment means I'm cooking, eating, sleeping and living all in one small room and I think \"Why has this happened?\" My men are at home and my son tells me they're doing well and enjoying each others' company and I'm glad about that as I don't want them to be unhappy but it made me feel that I've been a burden and that it's a relief that I'm not there. He as much as told me that. I like being here on my own but I know that my friends, when they come, are sad for me when they see that I'm living like this. It's a nice apartment, clean and bright but one room for everything??? I've written a long email to my son and told him how I feel and that my already fragile marriage, which I nurtured and built up for forty years has finally come crashing down because of one blonde bimbo with whom they've both become entangled in one way or another. I don't want to sound boastful but it's the truth when I say that she's not worth 1% of my worth. She's a taker and a user and they've both been taken in by her. I've done the adult and courageous thing by taking full responsibility for my life as soon as I found a way I was able to do it but that doesn't mean it's easy. I wake in the night and wonder what happens if I suddenly get ill. What do I do? There's no one here to assess me and make suggestions or give advice. I don't even know whether, if I called an ambulance, they could get into the building because of the security (something I have to look into tomorrow). There's no one in charge here from midnight till seven the next morning. I told my son to show the email to my husband and make him read it because my husband doesn't like reading long emails. I've told him my husband needs to come and see me tonight because I'm depressed and at the very least I want acknowledgement that I've stepped out of their way to look after myself and give them a better quality of life. My husband has said he will phone me and come tomorrow night because it's too late now (7pm). I feel so cheated and let down and alone. All week all my son could talk about to me were the strategies they're going to use to get the BB (blonde bimbo) to leave and go back to her home in Singapore until I could scream if I heard one more reference to her. I told him on Messenger that what they do is nothing to do with me, that I gave them advice in August and again in October about what to do and it wasn't done. I said that I would come and live on my own unless they did something about her, yet nothing happened. Married forty years and with cancer and I'm left to fend for myself. I admit it IS my choice but I've gone in one massive leap from being looked after 24/7 to being entirely responsible for everything I do, including making sure I take correct doses of my narcotic drugs and patches without anyone here to supervise. I was actually going to come on this thread to tell you girls that I didn't think I could continue on this thread because of the pain I feel at having a husband who doesn't care enough about me to look after me but, after reading your post, Claudia, I've decided to tell you girls of my pain and hope someone can find some words of comfort. My moods go from elation one day to despair the next at times. I'm waiting for a counsellor to contact me. She's been given my number.",

Just one long story of complaints and that's not like me at all, so when I just read your supportive posts I felt a bit better about it. Well, I've got it all out of my system now so I'll be getting on with life. My husband came and brought dinner with him last night and we chatted and I'm happy to say we're on good terms. I did have to stand up for myself a couple of times but he's accepted that this is what I want and both he and my son are willing to help me to do what I can to maximise the space. Minnie...I'm sorry you have that worry about your husband. The way I look at MBC is that we should all just live in the moment. We've all had some good times in the past. I know I have despite all my complaining just lately, I've been a very adventurous person and I've done some crazy things and had a lot of fun. I've done most of the things I wanted to do and now I'm living my dream of having a little place to myself. It was only a vague outline of a dream but suddenly I really wanted it because my MBC had robbed my son of too many years of his young life and I wanted him to have his life back to have some of the fun I had when I was his age. So, now that I've vented to you all about my problems, I'm ready to move on again and get back to being the real me. I refuse to look at MBC as a life sentence or to think about the future in bleak terms. It doesn't help to imagine things going wrong; in fact it makes it worse. I choose to believe I'll live many, many more years and that the Ibrance/Letrozole combination will eventually start working for me. We can all say to ourselves \"Oh no, my life as I know it is over\" and that may be true but our LIFE ITSELF isn't over and we can make this new, different life a good one by believing, really believing and knowing that we will be ok. Our cancer may progress, we know that, but I for one am not going to sit here thinking about it! A lot of you are a lot sicker than I am, although I am in a lot of pain but I'm grateful that my mets went to my bones and not my liver because my diagnosis came very late and it would have been too late. I believe that this is for a reason and I'm going to make the rest of my life a mission of educating people on how to treat people like us ~ what to say and not say, how to help us, the sorts of things they can do when they say \"let me know if there's anything I can do\" I'll take them up on it because I know they mean it and, if they don't, well, they shouldn't have said it!! So if they didn't mean it and they're given a list it's their bad luck hahaha! One of my friends is coming on Tuesday to start helping me to make the tiny balcony a garden, as I might have mentioned and once it's done to my satisfaction I'll post some photos to show you. Thanks for being so patient with me. I'm proud to call you friends.",

It makes me want to keep on the move because then my legs stop twitching and they don't ache so much but if I move around too much the bone mets in my back ache like crazy! I just try to go with the flow. I'm feeling quite thrilled, though, because I went for an evening walk! I've always loved walking and I used to walk - fast - morning and/or evening every day for 40 minutes. Then after my diagnosis my MO told me I'm not to go for walks until he gives me the ok. I guess it's the jarring on my bones, because they were really fragile and I was snapping bones right, left and centre. Well, he hasn't exactly given me the ok. Ive given it to myself because I think, as long as I'm careful, I can do it now. I make sure I wear laced up sneakers with high tops so I'm not wearing shoes I could trip in. It was probably only 100 metres (yards for you guys) there and back but it was enough to feel part of real life again, living in the city as I do now. To those who are downsizing, it's really a hard thing to do because we accumulate so many things that have sentimental value and you can spend ages picking things up and putting them down again without deciding what to do with them. I started with clothes and anything I hadn't worn for the last season or two I sorted into three bags ~ those I would just throw away because they were past their used by in terms of being worn out; those I would give to charity and those I would keep. Having just had the mastectomy helped because there were a lot of things I simply couldn't wear anyway. With other things, like pieces of crockery that have been passed down after our parents left, I found it better to give them away to whoever I wanted to have them after I'm gone before I go and give them the pleasure now. Then there are all the little bits and pieces. Be ruthless. If you don't use it just throw it in a bag and get rid of it ~ you know the sort of things we collect without meaning to; stationery, junk jewellery that doesn't look good any more, gloves that have one missing, handbags that are out of fashion or that you don't love. In fact that's a rule in itself ~ if you don't seriously love something, don't keep it. I don't know whether this helps because I still own a lot of junk I don't really want and I'm not even a hoarder! I know I've missed a few out but I've started posting on this page and i've found in the past that if I go back a page to check, I lose the post I've started writing so Gracie it seems you still need lots of hugs and prayers ~ you've got them. Mel ~ I found your post, I've been looking for it. Please, please watch your step. None of us needs a fall. I know it's Christmas and all that but I hope no one is climbing ladders to decorate the house and the trees. I sound like Mother! But our health is so much more important. I'm about to get ready to get ready for bed if that makes sense. By the time I do my three different mouth rinses and take my lovely (not!) Movicol drink because the pain killers slow things down, and make sure I have everything I need, like a book, in case I'm awake in the night, it takes ages to get to bed! And because I'm tired, I get slower and slower and ..... I suppose you're all starting your day so I hope things are good for you all. Hugs xxx",

A friend offered to help me turn the small balcony on my apartment into a garden because I have to have flowers around me and to grow things but, because I'm on Ibrance I'm not allowed to have anything to do with soil....breathe it or touch it...because my white cell count is so low. Nikki loves doing things like that and she's the sort who throws herself right into a project. We had so much fun during the week. She called in and we brainstormed ideas for the area which is only 3 metres by 2.5 metres (pretend metres are yards if you're American and you're close enough), then the next day she went to the plant nursery and we both got on Messenger and she sent me pictures of plants we'd said we thought would look good. She would group some together and take a pic and I'd say I like the yellow and purple (or whatever) and we bought, oh, about 50 plants that way! Then we chose some lovely green leafy shrubs with an upright growing habit in graduated sizes. We had to be careful as the air con unit blasts hot air across the balcony when it's turned on. We put a tiered plant stand in two corners and hung five window box type planters full of flowering plants from the balcony rail and we covered the tiled floor with fake green grass. It looks fabulous!! I'm thrilled. I can sit out there and have breakfast surrounded by flowers and greenery. It takes me half an hour to water them all as I can only carry a small watering can due to my bone mets but that's fun anyway! We did it in two stages. She came on Tuesday and we made a start then we finished it on Thursday. I'm so indebted to her. It's changed the whole atmosphere of the apartment because you see the plants as soon as you walk in. It's taken my mind off cancer and all my other worries, which is just what I wanted. Nikki has been begging me to let her do something for me until now but there was honestly nothing I needed her to do and she was genuinely thrilled when I asked for her help with this project. This is how wonderful friends can be. Hugs to you all. I'll catch up with your news in the next few days.",

It's great to be able to just say the words and we all know what it means to us to know that this disease is being controlled. 50sgirl....I agree with you when you say how lucky we are to have these new drugs but, you know, in Australia, Ibrance only became available in May last year which is disgusting when we know that the US and 50 other countries made it available a few years ago. Even now it's so expensive it's out of reach for everyday working people. I'm just so fortunate that I was given a place on a trial that Pfizer is holding, trying to persuade the Australian government to put it on the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme) so that all women who need it can afford it. The reason the government agency gave for not putting it up as a recognised PBS drug is because Letrozole is keeping women alive quite well and that the first trial ~ I think they were referring to the Paloma 1 trial? ~ showed that it only gave women who were given the actual drug ten months longer than those in the control group. I read that and was so angry because Ibrance hasn't been in use long enough to know exactly how much longer we can count on and because that trial was stopped because the women in the control group were falling so far behind the Ibrance group. Further, even if it is only ten months, for us with MBC ten months is long enough to hope that another therapy will be made available. Ten months is A LONG TIME when you're looking at your mortality. I'd better get off my soapbox but I just can't believe how shortsighted they are and the callousness of it. Women are dying while the government makes excuses because the reality is that it will cost $10 million in the first year if they put it on the PBS and more each year after that. They're putting a price on women's lives. Tanya....I felt really sad for you reading your post. I'm so sorry you're in that position and I hope you have lots more time to enjoy your life with your husband. I wish the same for all of us. Micmel....look after yourself and enjoy the time between now and the wedding! How exciting!! Bigbhome....I'm only just catching up with your news. What a fright you must have had. I have to go back and read some posts properly. I've only had time to skim today. I don't know how it is that I have so little time. I was talking to a friend who visited today and saying that cancer is almost a full time job, with making sure we take our drugs at the right time (I have a day sheet and write down each drug and the time I took it so I don't lose track), trying to keep well by careful hygiene ~ not that we didn't before but we have to be extra careful now to avoid infection ~ trying to eat a healthy diet when we don't really feel like eating at all, at least I don't. So many little things, not to mention the big things like appointments for scans, blood tests, oncology visits which all take up so much of our time and energy. I'm not too worried about privacy. I don't reveal anything untoward! Hugs to everyone",

Very, very casual but it was \"out\"....you know that place that we're all forgetting exists? My husband has a business colleague from the UK over here in Perth (Australia) this week and they sprang a surprise on me and came and collected me to go for a bite to eat with them in between their commitments. It was just SO lovely meeting someone new and interesting and hearing about the places in England that I'm interested in, having watched a lot of British TV documentaries on the countryside. As a second generation Australian with my roots only just planted in Australia, I find the English countryside calls to me. Perhaps an ancestor's DNA is strongly represented but, regardless of why, it was fascinating to chat with someone from a different place. AND the big thing was I felt WELL!! I've felt very poorly for the last two weeks so I think I'm now into my \"good\" spell during the Ibrance cycle, thank goodness, which means ten days when I can enjoy a slightly better quality of life. I'm learning to grab onto these good times and make the most of them. ",

I only had ten days between the two as my situation was dire. I cried and cried as much as I needed to because it is hard and harrowing. I didn't spend a lot of time looking at them in the mirror though. I thought it best not to dwell on that too much. I did cuddle them a lot because I loved them. I used to have nice breasts but I was 66 at operation so, you know how it is, they were ok but not how they used to be! Once it came to operation day I was kept busy with prep for a scan with dye to show up the lymph nodes and I had decided the night before there would be no more tears. I would approach it in a clinical, business like manner to make it as easy on my emotions as I could. I felt that to go to theatre (operating room) in tears would complicate matters re the anaesthetic. When I became conscious, I became aware I was crying so my subconscious knew what had happened before my mind was awake. It's up to you how you approach this life changing experience but that was my way and it worked for me for that period of time. The adjustment period post op is another matter but I've decided to be completely positive and optimistic and make the most of life. The hormone treatment I'm on should give me enough years to enjoy but it's different from before....not because of the surgery, that's now past history....but because of the metastasis in my bones and the length of time it will take to kill off those tumours. I love my life despite the changes.",

I have always looked but sort of through half closed eyes, not fully looking but now I'm proud of this little, skinny body of mine and what it's been through. I've always been fairly delicate, physically but tough emotionally and recovery from the operation has been a long, slow process for me. It is difficult at your stage and there will be more times when you just can't believe this has happened to you but be kind and patient with yourself. Your positive nature will get you through. I've been through most of the stages of grief and now the loss of my breasts isn't something I think about much any more and, once you get to this stage, it's actually quite comfortable not having them. There are all sorts of ways to dress to disguise the flat chested look...tunic tops with gathering or pin tucks in the strategic area and scarves work well. Then there's always my prosthesis bra, which has the advantage that you can choose the size you want to be! Dolly Parton included!

Even so, when I did discover the enormous tumour in my right breast, courtesy of cleverly developing an obvious one in the left one, which saved my life, even my BS was shocked because clinically he didn't even pick up that it was so big.

Btw she's a beautiful girl ~ lovely features and I can see the character in her face. It's tough trying to find clothes when we're not well enough to go trying them on for all the usual reasons ~ possibly picking up an infection and the fatigue. At the best of times, trying on one outfit after another is tiring. Have you thought of looking online? It's a bit iffy buying online, I know, because you can't really tell what it will be like. Or do you have a friend who would go to a store where they let you take some outfits out of the store \"on appro\"? Some stores will do that. Or, perhaps a dressmaker might come to your house and measure you up. There's always an easier way, I find. Re prosthetics, I've bought mine online from the US and had them sent to Australia as I haven't found anything comfortable here. I don't know whether you have that organised but if you'd like to know more about the ones I bought, you can PM me. They're very comfortable, although I had a bilateral mastectomy so I don't have to be concerned about having an evenly weighted prosthetic to match up with a remaining breast. We were discussing privacy and I wasn't concerned but I did google my screen name and my posts came up. I'm not concerned about that because I know that this site can be followed but I've removed my actual photo, as you can see, and found someone cuter than I am!",

I almost lost you again as I forgot to add it to My Favourites so I'll rectify that. I'll gradually get to know you all and share more of myself. I'm not one for being shy! I'm seeing the oncologist tomorrow for my five weekly check up as I'm on a Letrozole/Ibrance trial in Australia. I've been on it since the end of January and have been dropped from the 125mgm dose to the 100mgm dose but so far I've always needed a two week break at every cycle. I just noted your comment about tumour markers and will add my story to the list so that others can benefit from knowing TMs can do strange things. When my MBC was diagnosed, de novo Stage IV with extensive mets to the bones, in October 2016 my TM was 784. Immediately after my BMX, it shot up to 1,200. After two months of Letrozole only treatment it was in the 900s. Ibrance was added at the end of January this year and every month my TM dropped by more than 100. I was elated! I thought I'll have this thing licked in no time. By the end of May it was 390 but then in June it shot up to 520 and since then it's been between 510 and 450 each cycle. Tomorrow I'll find out what it's doing at the moment. SO happy to know the news about Lita!",

If I don't ask for the number, he or the nurse don't tell me so you could try asking them whether they run it or not and, if not, you can try requesting one. As Micmel says, it's your body. I used to ask for my TM every time but I'm not going to any more because last cycle it had dropped by 60, to 450 and this cycle it's jumped back up to 520, which is what it was at the previous CA15.3 so that just shows that it's not terribly significant in your overall picture. Mine is jumping all over the place. Oncologists prefer to go by how you are clinically and what your scans are showing so I've decided not to bother asking for mine any more. Lynnwood...I agree with Micmel. 64 isn't a high number by any means. Normal is less than 35, or 33, I've forgotten which, and a jump of 2 or 3 is marginal. When tumour cells die there's a flare as they try to keep alive, much like the way a tree will throw out lots of seeds when it's dying, to preserve its species. Unless your oncologist is seriously worried, I wouldn't worry unless a scan shows there's a reason for it. Micmel....I've been told I could be on the Letrozole/Ibrance combination for years and years and I choose to believe that. As I said in my earlier post, it's often a very slow process in killing off the cancer cells and I had a very high tumour marker with a massive amount of bone mets so I'm not surprised mine is taking a while to show a really good result. Meanwhile, my two scans have both shown stable disease and stable disease is good enough for me! I don't see any reason to doubt it will stay that way while I'm on this regime. My philosophy is to take the tablets, show up for appointments, follow instructions and the rest of the time try to keep out of mischief....or into it, depending on my mood hahaha! Claudia...your husband looks like such a lovely man! Gracie.....I'm so sorry you have this worry. I'll be sending prayers over your way for Friday and Tuesday and lots of hugs as well.",

After I wrote that post my husband did call me and he had read my email and had taken it all in and he spoke gently, taking full responsibility for what has happened to me because of his involvement with the BB so that was a start. He told me he misses me and looks for me every morning before remembering I'm not there but that he admires me for my courage by wanting to give our son back his life as soon as I could look after myself sufficiently. I was quite nonplussed, to be honest, as that's unusual for him. He told me that he's always loved me and he thought I knew that but I told him that it doesn't show by his actions and he accepted that. But he tried to persuade me into going home for a visit and it took a lot to convince him that I'm not ready to do that. That what used to be our home no longer feels like a home but a prison to me. The BB isn't there, by the way. She stayed with us for 2 or 3 months on and off earlier in the year though. He was insistent until I told him that he's trying to make me do what HE wants me to do AGAIN and that I want to make decide things like that for myself. I said that I can never go back home to live because of the bad memories and the house being so enormous. By the way Micmel, I do have cleaners who come every week. Even when I was well the house was too big for me to take care of. We are also assigned breast care nurses in Australia but I found out that the day before my bilateral mastectomy that the nurse who had been assigned to me called my husband as she didn't have my number and he told her I wouldn't be needing her, without even discussing it with me. I've spoken to my trial nurse and she's going to put a new breast care nurse in touch with me. She'll come to my apartment to talk with me. But I've strayed from my point.....Last night I told my husband that we need to talk about my circumstances, that I want to live alone but that this apartment is too small. He asked me what it is that I want. He's never asked me that before and I've never made demands before so I decided the time has come to do that. I said that I want a one bedroom apartment because I need a separate room to sleep in but the apartment must be small or I won't cope alone. We have a superannuation fund that we can draw on to finance properties so I knew that we can juggle things around to make the funds available should we find a suitable apartment. I really didn't expect anything would come from saying that but soon after my son sent me a link to several apartments they'd found close to where I am now. I'd said I want to stay in this area because it's convenient for my friends and there are shops alongside. I was so surprised! However, I'm not counting any chickens in case he's just humouring me. I'll find out tonight because he's going to visit me and bring dinner. I want to stay on good terms because, apart from his selfishness, we do like each other and I do know he loves me but the selfishness gets in the way. Sorry, I can't make this any shorter. It's become very long! This morning I was very pleased with myself because I walked up to the corner where there's quite a good supermarket and bought a few things; this is a big step for me as I've been told to take it carefully due to the bone mets but as long as I'm careful no one knocks into me I'll be ok. There's a beautiful big park not far away, which overlooks our beautiful Swan River, which I've been planning to gradually build up my strength to be able to visit there and I found that it's much easier than I thought and, on a good day, I can already do it! I love nature so this makes a big difference for me. The convenience of city living with the love of nature combined! Thank you so much, girls, I really needed friends to talk to last night. To everyone else I will answer the other posts after a rest as it's been a big morning",

Take it very easy. You don't want to relapse. If you go out, please wear a good quality mask. I always wear one to the pathology lab and the oncology clinic and I hardly go anywhere but if I do I don't touch my face till I've got home and washed my hands thoroughly. If I'm just popping to the shops I smear the outside of my nostrils with Bactroban antibiotic ointment as we were told by a friend that he avoided the Northern Hemisphere flu when travelling in Europe recently by doing this. His wife and daughter refused to do it and both became ill. The poem is beautiful and I can relate to it but I do try not to dwell on such thoughts as they can lead us down the pathway to Melancholy, I find. I try to live in the moment and not to think about how it \"should\" be. It doesn't help me, although I do look longingly at my car, which I've given my son to drive, occasionally and dream of zooming down the freeway at speed! I'm improving at my exercises though. I can now do everything I used to do except for running and walking and anything else active! I've been working on squatting on the floor flat on my feet and then rising to the balls of my feet and balancing without holding onto anything and I've achieved that goal this week. This, after being bedridden for two to three years, is amazing to me. It took me about three months to get back to that level, along with the other exercises I do. Anyway, before I toddle off for dinner, I popped in with my scan results and it's good news. My CT shows that, after a year on Ibrance and Letrozole, my organs are still clear and my bone scan was stable. No better, but no worse. Stable is good enough for me until the next scan which I'm sure will show some regression. The reason? My neutrophil level didn't drop as far as usual after the three weeks on Ibrance and I've been able to start a new cycle after only one week, instead of two as has been the case since I started on it. In fact, my neutrophil count after one week was the highest I've had, even after two weeks off it, which means more treatment can be delivered and that's why I'm delighted.",

At my very first mammogram at a private clinic in 2000 when I was 50 I was told I had mild calcifications and was referred to a government clinic (I'm in Australia, btw) as the private clinic didn't have facilities for follow up at that time. I was seen by a BS (female, didn't like her and it was mutual) who sent me for core biopsies which were done without ultrasound guidance so it was hit and miss. After 20 misses, they gave up trying to find a calcification to biopsy and sent me back to the BS who told me calcifications don't always turn malignant so put me on a two yearly mammogram program at the government clinic. I duly presented myself every two years and each time received a clear report. There was absolutely nothing to suggest there was anything wrong with my right breast. Its appearance didn't change and there was no lump felt, even by doctors. i gradually became very ill from 2011 on, until by 2013 I was too ill to go for my scheduled mammogram, but even if I had it wouldn't have shown up on a mammogram because the entire breast was cancerous and because previous reports had been clear, well, let's face it, they were just plain slack in their surveillance! What saved my life was the rare occurrence of a primary tumour developing in my left breast, which though only 2cm, was a very obvious lump. I immediately went to the private clinic for U/S and biopsies and that's how the advanced stage of cancer in my right breast was discovered. I had always said that if I had breast cancer in one breast I would have a bilateral mastectomy but it was obvious that I needed one as soon as the diagnosis was seen. To date the government clinic has refused to take responsibility for their complete lack of competence and so has the BS. Sending you a great big hug and an event free recovery.",
