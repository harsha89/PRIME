I've spoken with my husband.  I don't want him in the doctors office tomorrow (unless he really wants to be).  Though he will be in the waiting room so I know I'm not being abandoned.  I told him he needs to let me know when he's ready to see it.  I'm sure he will be okay with it, but I want it to be on his terms when he thinks he can take it.  He's under a lot of stress right now as my mom passed away in June, I've got cancer, work is stressful, we've got 3 boys, and he quit smoking in May after I was diagnosed.  As much as I need love and nurturing, I know he does, too.

      "Content": "3boys4me wrote: I'm hoping those of you who have experienced lymphedema can answer some questions for me.  Mine cropped up about a month or so ago.  I had a unilateral mastectomy 9/6 with 14 lymph nodes removed. In October I flew.  I requested a prescription for a sleeve and gauntlet from my surgeon prior to my flight (after reading this board and the info provided by the lymphedema specialist while still in the hospital) but was basically ignored. During the same time, I was repeatedly aspirated after my drains were removed. Who knows what really brought this on, but it's here.  Luckily it early stage.  I now have a sleeve and gauntlet that I've been wearing daily.  It's ugly but not uncomfortable, so I really don't mind it as much as I thought I might. My questions are:  my lymphedema specialist said if I lost weight, the lymphedema would likely improve.  I do need to lose about 40 lbs.  Has anyone else had this recommendation and if so, has anyone been successful in losing weight and seeing improvement in the lymphedema? Also, I find that hotter and more humid weather seems to make the lymphedema worse.  Anyone else experience this? And finally, do you find you have to wear the sleeve and gauntlet EVERY day or are you able to give yourself a breather on occasion without experiencing increased swelling? I had another question, but my chemo brain seems to be causing me mental problems AGAIN.  Oh, now I remember, it's about sleeping on that side, but I'll read through the other thread as I'm sure everyone has chimed in on that question already. Sorry for the long winded post, but I've read through the threads and many of you seem so knowledgable.

Those of you who are having trouble sleeping, ask for Ativan.  I think is for anxiety, but also helps with stomach problems and helps you sleep.  I take one or two at night and it really helps without making me all weird or feeling drugged the next morning. I just had my 1st of 4 chemos yesterday followed up by my neulasta shot today.  So far so good, but I'm told days 3-4 are the worst.  I'm going to think positive that I'll not have any SE's.  Yeah, right, but I can hope!  love to all, Lisa",

I am so dreading starting chemo again.  My hair is about 1-1/2 inches long since I stopped my first rounds of chemo back in mid-June, my nails are better than they've ever been and I just generally feel good, so the thought of going through the nausea and fatigue and metallic taste in the mouth, the mouth sores, etc., etc... again is starting to get to me.  The fluid accumulation from the mastectomy and lymph node dissection seems to be subsiding - at least to me.  Will know for sure tomorrow when I see my surgeon to see if he's going to give me the all clear sign.  love to all, Lisa",

About me - I'm 46, married, live in San Diego and have 3 boys ages 10, 14 and 17.  I decided to not work during treatment which has been a blessing.  I'm Stage 2, Intermediate grade, ER/PR+, Her2/Neu -.  I know this isn't the club you ever wanted to join, but it's still nice to have others going through treatment with you.

I saw my surgeon this morning and got aspirated again.  No drain though.  I'm not sure if that is good news or bad.  I go back again Friday.  I'm currently scheduled to start chemo again on the 25th, but I'm sure that date will depend on what the surgeon says this Friday. TexasKaren- it sure seems everyone's recipe is different.  From what I understand, the rule of thumb is lumpectomy and rads OR mastectomy and chemo.  I don't follow the rule as I had neo-adjuvant chemo, lumpectomy, mastectomy, and still have more chemo and rads to go.  Evy- You've got a lot to deal with.  Know you are in my thoughts and prayers as well as the thoughts and prayers of others on this board. Take care everyone, Lisa",

I see my surgeon today for a follow up after mastectomy and the oncologist tomorrow to find out when I will start chemo again.  I get chemo and radiation because of the size of the tumor, age and lymph node involvement.  On a good note (if you can call it that) I got my breast prosthesis last Friday after I got my drains removed and I love it.  I also bought a mastectomy suit through Lands End and it's not too bad.  I can do this   We can do this!

Since the chemo was so successfull, I elected to do a lumpectomy and SNB. Well, just got the pathology report back and there is possible additional lymph node involvement. At first my docs suggested a mastectomy and lymph node removal, but then they decided to send me to the oncology radiologist. They said if the radiologist was confident he could radiate the entire area they'd feel confident to go that direction. Well, the radiologist was non-committal and he suggested waiting until the they all meet this coming Tues in a tumor board to discuss my case. In my heart and mind I just want to leave things as be and get the chemo, rads and tamoxifen, but if that leaves too much risk of the cancer spreading, then logically I know I need to have the mastectomy. Then with a mastectomy comes so many more decision as to reconstruction and the length of time for treatment seems overwhelming.

I had a 5cmx3cm tumor and was put on Taxotere and Xeloda prior to surgery to shink the tumor.  It was successful as my follow up mammogram and MRI showed the tumor was gone.  I subsequently had a lumpectomy with SNB, but my doctors were still concerned that there might be tumor left.  I went on to have a mastectomy and lymph node dissection which was the right choice as I had residual cancer in my breast and 6/14 lymph nodes.  Best of luck to you on this journey and know we are here with you, Lisa",

I am planning on getting reconstruction.  I didn't realize I'd have to wait so long between treatments.  I know I'll be starting chemo in October for 4 cycles.  I went to a BC educational seminar yesterday and here's what I found out: I will need to wait about a month after chemo before starting radiation.  Then, I'm hearing most people have to wait at least 6 months or longer for reconstruction AND once you have radiation, implants are not a viable option and TRAM flap, LAT flap, free flap or DIEP are the options - all of them involving longer surgeries and longer recovery periods. I also just read my most recent pathology report and based on it, I'm Stage 3A, Intermediate grade.  (T2,N2,MX)  I had 6 of 14 nodes test postive along with DCIS and IDC - hence the surgery, chemo, rads, and tamoxifen. keep in touch, Lisa",

My next AC isn't until the 26th and I hope I do as well as with the 2nd as I did with the 1st.  My head hurts which I know is a sign that my hair will be shedding soon.  I plan to get it buzzed as soon as the shedding begins.  The hats and scarves are lined up and ready to go.  I'm going to go back and read everyone's posts, but know I'm thinking of each and every one of you as we go through this journey together. hugs all around, Lisa",

Having already gone through chemo once, I'd forgotten these things until you ladies brought them up again.  Now I find myself mentally preparing for my AC infusion on Wednesday. hugs to all, Lisa",

Karen #2 - if you have chemo on Mondays you should be in relatively good shape by the weekend, though perhaps a little tired. Seems like most of you are dealing well with the side effects of chemo.  I'm dreading going through it again.  I was trying to plan the chemos so they don't ruin Thanksgiving and Christmas, but now I'm not sure I can control my schedule.  My chemo date has been moved to the 25th.  I'll be getting drains put back in on the 15th to help with the fluid that keeps accumulating in my chest since the mastectomy.  Hopefully the drains will dry me out so the chemo doesn't keep getting pushed back.
