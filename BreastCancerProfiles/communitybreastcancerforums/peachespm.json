I was starting to think... well we won't go there. I know I will have to make the journey. I am prepared for the journey even though at times I have my emotional times. I am pretty upbeat. The drs. have said they can't really stage it, which for me is odd. The oncologist said it was between a 2 and 4 but not 4 and it was curable.  She also said she wanted to do radiation just in case I said fine. I am going to end this for now and thanks again. I am proceeding to your site.",

My oncologist originall said she wanted to do agressive chemo, however the drug combination she originally was going to use was CT. She said once every three weeks. After chemo she also wants to do radiation of the axillary area and left breast, so she is covering all grounds. Hopefully by the time I am through I will still be in my fiscal year of insurance. It goes from July 1 to June 30 or the next year. I have a PPO and right now I am almost at my 1000 out of pocket. They have been really good. After my treatments are all over she is going to put me on Tax. however I am going to talk to her about that drug since I am post men. Shirlann I have heard about the book and I might go to the library to pick it up. I also have soo much info (that does not pertain to me)that I am returning. It all covers the breast. Sometimes I have found you get so much info as first and it is hard to remember everything  you read so I take a step back and deal with one issue at time.  Spunkygirl, Apparently you stage breast cancer according to the breast??? I have some info from Bessie that I am bringing to my Oncologist today and asking her. I know my daughter is going to be there not sure about other half, sometimes when all three of us are in the room it is hard to get the questions out. I manage to somehow though.  I would love to understand the path report better than I do. I need to sit down at the compute and look up some of the words they use, however bottom line is I have breast cancer and nothing is going to make that go away. SO... I will join the ranks of woman with no hair!!!! LOL... I am ready!!! HUGS!!!     ",

I have Breast Cancer I am fine with the diagnosis, however the one thing that concerns me is with the ultrasound I go and the MRI and Cat Scan nothing showed up in the breast itself. I had a 4.5 lymph node removed for biopsy and it came back cancer. Then I had to go in for a left Axillary lymph node dissection and sure enough they took out 18 more lymph nodes and out of those 18, 9 were cancer. I have Er and PR hormone type. They can't grade it or really correctly stage it because again not in breast. The Cancer Center navigator said for all the BC patients she has had I am unique. Any input on this?? Trust me I am not in denial and I am doing my research on the stats that I have. Yes I have BC and Yes I will be going through the whole nine yards... chemo, radiation and taxo.
