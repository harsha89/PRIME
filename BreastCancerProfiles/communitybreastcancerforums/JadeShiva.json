I have been doing research about permanent hair loss after treatment and there is a factor I cannot find research on. Please share your experience with me if you are willing. I would like to know- 1. Whether you were premenopausal, peri-menopausal or menopausal. 2. Your age at time of treatment. 3. Whether your hair was thinning, thick or in the process of thinning naturally. 4. How much grew back after treatment. Thank you all who reply, and thank all of you here for the time you've taken over the years to share your experiences and support. <3 Dx 7/13/2017, DCIS/IDC, Left, <1cm, Grade 1, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 8/9/2017, DCIS/IDC, Left, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 1/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Surgery 8/9/2017 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary Chemotherapy Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Hormonal Therapy Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast Log in to post a reply",

I discussed using a different taxane with my oncologist and she said she would see if research had been done swapping taxol for taxotere. She got back to me after the weekend and said there is no research showing a swap could occur. I'm annoyed as I see a lot of people using different treatments yet I want to believe she has my best interest at heart. They offered me another option not involving a taxane, but I worried about past treatments not being as effective at beating the cancer. I still need to research and I'm running out of time! It feels vain to not want to look like I have cancer the rest of my life but it's the truth.",

After reading through your posts and thinking a good long while, I decided to go with the taxotere and try the cold caps. I had it in my mind that those with the most vigorous hair would be most impacted, but there doesn't seem to be a theme.  I'm one long week post treatment. My hair is still hanging in there. I would expect to see changes in another week or so but who knows? Maybe the caps will work. On a side note, I'm a hairy lady. My darn chin hairs are growing as vigorously as ever! ðŸ˜†",
