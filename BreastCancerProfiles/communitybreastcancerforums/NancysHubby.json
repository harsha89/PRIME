      "Content": "NancysHubby wrote: Hello. I've lurked here off and on for a year, have learned much and gleaned much via your shared experiences, and finally registered so I can say \"thanks\". I am the caregiver for my wife, who was diagnosed 5/09 Stage III. She did TCH (6x TC) prior to double mastectomy 10/09 (7 nodes involved as well), continued with Herceptin and did rads x37. As of this spring, we were told she was NED even though the doc never would give her a PET to confirm that despite our requests. He tried her on two different AI's (more on this later) and she went into a profound depression with each, so she went to Tamoxifen. She was hospitalized in Jan '10 with a pulmonary embolism (perhaps caused to Herceptin), and has been on Coumadin ever since with regular monitoring of INR.Â  In May '10, she fell for no reason, hit her head with no LOC, and I took her to ER in case of a brain bleed (due to being on Coumadin). ER doc came back with the worst kind of \"goodnews/badnews\": no brain bleed, but found a small 14 mm met on her brain. Her onc wanted craniotomy. Wanting a second opinion, I sent her records to Sloan-Kettering and case was presented to their brain tumor board. They strongly suggested gamma knife, said no ned for drilling her head...and her onc wasn't happy when we chose that route. Radiosurg in June was successful. Now, a week before Christmas, we learned that she has several small lymph nodes in her chest that were hot, along with a small tumor on one adrenal gland. Onc was really cavalier in telling us this, made up treatment plan on the fly while we were there, first wanted to treat endocrinologically by giving her a shot to force menopause, and then starting an AI. When I reminded him that he had put her on AI's last year (and she wasn't postmenopausal THEN, either), he looked back and said \"oh yeah\". I now understand that AI's are contraindicated premenopause...but that little detail escaped the doc's purview. Next, he says we'll go with Xeloda/Tykerb. Between futzing with the insurance co. for pre-auth, it was 10 days before it got here. The day before it arrived, I researched Xeloda, and discovered an FDA black box warning for interactions with Coumadin...the same Coumadin that the same doc prescribed for her and monitored blood levels every few weeks for the last 10 months. He didn't bother to tell us about THAT little detail when writing it, and when I caught it and called, the nurse said that it could have caused her INR levels to skyrocket (decent poss. of brain bleed, internal bleeding that's tough to control, etc.). Thanks for reading this far, I promise the point is coming. When we first learned of the new mets, I immediately made an appointment at a major university breast cancer center 3.5 hours away from us, for a 2nd opinion. They got us in on the 23rd, a wonderful onc spent a few hours with us until 7 PM (when everyone else had left to begin their holiday), and she presented some clinical trials that she thought would benefit my wife so that we might keep Xeloda available later. We're keenly interested in one study wherein 2 of the 3 arms would get TDM1. We were told that if my wife started the Xeloda we had at home, she'd be ineligible...so we pondered it over the holiday while starting Tykerb without Xeloda. We'll likely sign up for the study tomorrow, and make the trip to this clinic once a week or more. We have horses and several pets, so staying in another city longterm would be challenging logistically. Here lies my main question for the wizened folks here: has anyone been treated by an onc they'd consider their primary, with said onc being in a city that's not very near? We really have had it with the onc she's seen locally since diagnosis and would love to fire him and use this new doc, but I have concerns on how it would work out should my wife need to be hospitalized emergently and I can't schlep her 3.5 hours to be treated. I want the very best care for her (of course), especially with this new progression, and her current guy seems disengaged, as well as making dangerous mistakes x2. Any thoughts on this or any other part of the journey recounted above would be greatly appreciated, and God bless you all. Stay strong. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2010 11:58AM - edited Dec 29, 2010 12:00PM by NancysHubby Thank you all SO much for the replies! It's good to hear that others are doing/have done what we're planning to do. I'd go from here to Egypt to get her the best care if that's what it took, but from a QOL standpoint it's wonderful that we have a great facility that's reasonably commutable. We made some progress today, though a bumpy ride it was. It turns out that, during the 2.5 hour meeting with the Vandy doc discussing several trials and other choices (so much info it was like taking a drink from a fire hose), we misunderstood something key. We thought that starting Tykerb would NOT disqualify her from the TDM1 study, as long as she didn't start Xeloda. She was diagnosed 2 weeks ago today, and was eager to do SOMEthing. She's had three days' worth of Tykerb starting on Christmas, and that DQ'd her both at Vandy and at Sarah Cannon. It was a different study of a different agent that would have allowed Tykerb use prior, and we got our wires crossed. The trials director tried to get an exemption from the TDM1 study sponsor, but- no dice. She was very nice in trying for us. Nancy will start Xeloda tomorrow, except under the supervision of the Vandy doc instead of the local soon-ex-doc...and we have the name of a local (female) onc who the Vandy doc went to school with and refers to, so our ducks are starting to line up. They may not be lining up the way we planned, but we're hopeful anew and feeling a bit less adrift. Now, time to root for a productive and SE-minimal dance with Xeloda... Again, thanks to all for your input and encouragement. God bless each and every one of you, each and every day.",
