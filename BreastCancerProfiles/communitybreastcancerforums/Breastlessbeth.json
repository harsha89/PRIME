    "Content": "Breastlessbeth wrote: I went for my first treatment last week. The nurse at the desk asked me why I was there I said treatment she said go grab a seat. In the room where about 8 chairs with people getting chemo. I'm shocked that between HIPAA privacy laws and the threat of infection that any Hospital could think group chemo is a good thing. I almost think do to my meltdown the first time they're not going to want me in a group setting and I'll get a private room again . Although I've been told they're not always available but will call the doctor's office this week to get my name on a private room for my treatment in two weeks. Do you get group chemo or in a private room setting? Log in to post a reply",
