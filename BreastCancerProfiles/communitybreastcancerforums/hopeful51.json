    "Content": "Mar 28, 2008 01:47AM - edited Mar 28, 2008 01:49AM by hopeful51 I have been told if I decide to have chemo it will be April 1, don't know what to do, all my tests came back clear, nothing in the lymph nodes margins clear, bone scan clear, blood clear. The choice for chemo is mine, onocaologist feels homonal therapy will work only suggested it because I am a stage 11 cancer and because it was 3cm so it is a standard recommendation. I am terrified to have chemo. I need advice what do I do?",
