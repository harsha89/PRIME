One minute i'm not worried and the next i'm panicked. i've done a lot of reading/research which hasn't really helped in alleviating my fears especially when i discovered the vitD/BC link :( So 5 more days of driving myself up the wall. I have asked OH if we can go somewhere and do something nice this weekend to take my mind off the waiting. x",

It is quite difficult to find each time I try as it seems to move, sometimes it is really obvious and feels large and other times it feels small. I can feel it best when stood up with no bra on. I went to my GP on Tuesday who agreed she could feel it and that there was nothing similar in my right breast. She stated that due to my age it is \"probably just as cyst or fibroid\" but referred me for ultrasound and possibly a biopsy due to my appalling family history of various cancers: Mother: Breast cancer at 41 (survivor) Sister: Brain Tumor (died) Grandmother (maternal): Uterine, Mouth and finally pancreatic which she died from. All of my maternal grandmothers siblings have died of some type of cancer and her mother and father both succumbed to it also. This leaves me extremely worried. So following my referral I have been given a date of 20/10/2015 for my breast clinic date... I'm worried as I am now trying to remember every little niggle/pain or symptom I have had.. * About a month ago I was having awful pain in the area I found the lump which was worse when I inhaled or exhaled, that lasted about 24 hours and then disappeared. * I have suffered from stabbing/shooting pains intermittently for months in my left breast. * My left armpit is sore when feeling around. * I have been suffering from night sweats intermittently for about 18 months-2 years. * I was struggling with extreme fatigue a couple of months ago and was found to have a vit D deficiency. * My concentration/memory have been absolutely terrible for a good couple of months. I don't really know what I am asking for here, but any stories good or bad of others who have strong family histories would be great. I know from my post above and reading it back that things do not sound good :( I'm just finding it hard to wait for the 20th. Sorry for the extremely long post, and thank you for reading. xx Log in to post a reply",

I'm very heartened to hear about such good experiences with the SERMs etc. Do the hormone suppressing drugs diminish the need/benefit of a hysterectomy or removal of ovaries? The physician who gave us her lab results mentioned that this might be another option as well.",
