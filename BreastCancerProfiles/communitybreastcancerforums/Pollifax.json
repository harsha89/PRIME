I am 20 out of 30 treatments done today. My fair skin started pinking up last week and peeling a bit under the breast which is big and floppy. The substitute RO told me to use Aquifor. I did but it is seriously greasy. Today my regular RO said not to use it because of the greasiness and to get Miaderm. Holy cow that's some precious lotion, but it does absorb more quickly and goes on more smoothly. So far I like it better. The techs keep saying, don't wear anything with a wire (haven't been), go topless at home, and let it get some air. The RO suggested a few kleenexes balled up between breast and chest to help with air flow. I bought Coobies comfort bras and like them a lot - they are cotton and spandex but not tight and have thin pads to cover nipplage. For deodorant, I got a brand called Crystal. I just don't put any on until after therapy. It seems weird to lay down with my arm over my head so air can get underneath the breast, but it has improved the skin. I'm hoping it will get well enough to stay on track but we will decide on Friday if they skip to the boosts and come back for the overall treatment later. Fatigue has increased this week but the techs say that's normal. Best to you all - you'll know it is a routine when you can joke about the positioning process with the techs while your boobs are just out there on display ( my protocol requires the gown be folded down completely and a box taped to my stomach to gauge deep breath positioning) Fun times!",
