I started having my first symptoms in 2007. I first developed what i thought was carpal tunnel in my right hand. Then I started having a strange burning fluttery feeling in my left shoulder. The symptoms have progressed to involve both hands and both shoulders with a numbness running down both arms to my hands.I have extreme weakness in my arms that seems to progress daily. My radiation oncologist acts like i couldn't have caused this because I didn't radiate that low. The problem was caused by concurrent chemo ( cisplatin & taxetere) and 77 Rad of radiation. I dont get a fuzzy feeling when they say this is rare. Out of this treatment I have Chronic dry mouth, tongue neuopathy (chronic burning of tongue) and altered taste (salty). I have not been able to eat solid food since treatment and I have Dysautonomia that causes wild swinges in my blood pressure. Before my treatment I was an active mountain biker and in 2005 was able to ride again until my delayed side effects kicked in. Now I feel blessed to be able to walk my dog 3 times a day. Until my Brachial Plexopathy can along I could function on a limited basis. Now I am so weak I have difficulty carrying my own arms around. Because of numbness in my hands task that used to be easy is now close to impossible. Typing this comment requires careful pecking because I now fat finger all keyboard work.   ",
