I am terrified of permanent cancer brain.  A few weeks before my reoccurance diagnosis, my husband left me, so i need to be able to work and support myself.  (I was fired a few days after my husband left me so i need to find a new job and prove myself, meaning i need my brain to WORK). Moreover, I have just worked so hard to lose 50lbs.  I am not looking forward to gaining weight from the steriods. This really sucks but I am glad to be among you and sharing this ordeal together.",
