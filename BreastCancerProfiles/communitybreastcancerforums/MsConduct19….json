I was hoping to fly through chemo like my sister but alas, I ran into complications: had to get an appendectomy right after Labor Day weekend and spent 5 days in the hospital and missed a week of work. This put be back a month, and after cycle 3, I complained of heaviness in my chest, off to the ER again and another 2 day stay in the hospital. Which actually turned into a blessing, because my blood levels ended up being quite low. I wear bandanas to work (I teach PE) or wear a stocking cap to keep me warm but I am getting to the point of working with my bald head showing. The kids get a kick out of it and I make fun of myself. If all goes well, my last treatment is Dec. 9 and I will finally be able to travel! Radiation is to begin sometime in January. Haven't seen the radiologist yet.",
