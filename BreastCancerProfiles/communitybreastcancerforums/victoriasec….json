Ok this post may be long but i am going to tell u the path i have been traveling ...i think i mentioned mammos every year and US when something funky came up and always ...your fine fiber cystic breast disease go home ...even when my sister was diagnosed with early breast ca ..yep no red flag for me...so here is my family history Mom age 81 and still kicking...this is killing her ..but i told her she had to be strong for me I do not want my diagnosis to stress her...bowel ca x2, ovarian,and ureter . Sister IDC stage 1 rads  arimidex age 48 and then papilary serous uterine ca age 49 hyst.NFT she is 3 years older than me. we have all tested pos for HNPCC or Lynch syndrome it wasn't untill my sis developed second ca under 50 that red flags and genetics were questioned . I was told no worries breast is not part of HNPCC so i just continued with mammos every year and NOTHING was ever suspicious until my 7.5 freaking tumor was palpitated at my annual in June... Sooo long story long sitting in The oncs office and in comes my genetics councilor she looked so sad for me ...I told her how angry i was that why was I not followed more closely ...what could she say !! i am trying to get pastall this as it is too late for me but Lobular ca is sneaky... I have since come to find out that maybe there is another gene and not the BRAC(sister tested neg) that is responsible for our breast cas..a 2nd cousin in another Province(Canadian gal ) me toohas Muir Torre syndrome...breast is ass. with this I thought she had Cowdens ..which also has breast in its link Muir Torre is related to HNPCC. But I digress as to why I started here rambling is very therapeutic for me. My hairdresser's is coming to give me a PIXIE (oooh dating myself)cut today , my mother always chopped my hair short  i think it traumatized me ..he he ...so very Jaime Lee Curtis..i have verry curly hair and had just grown it out in the last few years..kinda a midlife crisis hair change...even resorted to straightening irons ... Say a prayer as I prepare for the start of my CHEMO tomorrow ,any tips would be greatly appreciated..please xcuse any typos.. much love Cheryl ps any Fbookers here I have met with some great stg 3 girls, and I also have a caringbridge web page,  just pm me .",

Yes I felt something but told dense breasts, fiber cystic. 2 years before diagnosis calcifications appeared ..still came back ...no abnormalities. When I first came on the boards in a panic my diagnosis was dcis...test by test they came to my final staging. I kept jumping boards.
