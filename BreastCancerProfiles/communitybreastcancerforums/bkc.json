Sometimes if I moved my wrist a certain way I would get a sharp pain and it hurt like heck. Couldn't do much of anything that required twisting or holding any thing that was the least bit heavy. Woke up this morning and it isn't hurting any more. Don't know what it was but what ever it is gone.",

Thank God my facility is only a fifteen minute trip away.I have been complaining about having my days interrupted and wanting this part of it to hurry up and be over. No more complaining for me!",

They always take us in the back way so I am not exposed to sick kids but then we wait in a little 8x10 room for 2 or 3 hours. Imagine doing that with an active 4 and 5 year old. The pedi is never on time and can be 2 or 3 hours late at times. Last time this happened I finally got aggravated and told the nurse we would wait outside for the Dr. When she showed up my 4 year old said \"Why you take sooooo long. You should get a clock.\" Wonder if I can bill her for my time?",

We have two young children 4 and 5 year old girls plus an 18 year old son and two older children. My husband and My 18 year old have been my rocks. I don't know what I would do without them. It was really hard for me to give up control of alot of the every day stuff but my husband and son managed beautifully. Even my babies were troopers and learned quickly how to pick up after themselves and give me hugs without hurting my booboos. My husband did the honors of shaving my head. My son and brother-in- law also shaved thier heads.(My husband doesn't have enough hair to shave) I never wore a wig didn't want to deal with that but everyone sent me great caps and hats and that was fine for me. I joined a bc support group and these ladies are now my dear friends. I have learned that this is not my fight alone and that my husband my kids and everyone around me are going through an emotional event. It is ok to cry,it is ok to scream at the top of your lungs and it is ok not to know what to say or do. But just a silent hug is wonderful for her and for you. I hope this helps.",

Only a tiny scar that healed quickly and started chemo week after insertion. I had very little pain and almost forget it's there sometimes. And the best part they don't have to dig around looking for a vain. Doesn't hurt at all when they take blood or flush the port.",

One thing the Onc. told me was to delay my kids shots because some of them are live viruses. Also when I took the kids to the Pedi she let me in thru her office so I wouldn't be exposed to other sick kids.",
