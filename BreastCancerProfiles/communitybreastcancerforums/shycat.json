I once had to bite my tongue when someone I knew with DCIS years ago and a lumpectomy as the only treatment started tsk-tsking over my choice of surgeon (hers was the best, in her not-so-humble opinion, saved her life he did!) and questioning why I had to have \"so much treatment\", as if it seemed all so unnecessary because I \"looked so good!\"  I had to remind myself that she was a sister survivor and simply had an easier journey, with limited insight into another's more difficult one.  But I so wanted to bite her head off at that moment.  So much for handling all this with grace and good humor.  I think I managed a half-way coherent explanation of why it was necessary to throw the book at a very aggressive form of BC, but I don't know if she really believed me.  Oh well.",
