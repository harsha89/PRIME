I'm looking for some tasty low cal, low fat, low sugar recipes.  I enjoyed Dhettish and Laurita's garlic ginger shrimp and \"yummy chicken\". Here are some things I keep on hand and munch on during the day to keep myself from reaching for the high calorie, high sugar foods: Con's Cole Slaw:  thinly sliced red cabbage thinly sliced red onion thinly sliced jalapenos small pinch of salt apple cider vinegar to taste stays in the fridge for days, crunchy, tasty Con's Spaghetti Sauce: Wash and cut fresh tomatoes, garlic, red onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, celery - place in a bowl - shake on some crushed red pepper, fresh ground pepper and very little salt - coat in olive oil and shake bowl Place above on a foil covered baking sheet at 350 til everything has a roasted look Remove skin off tomatoes and place mushrooms in a big skillet - place the remaining veggies in blender and puree Move to big skillet w/ mushrooms- add Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock, fresh basil and oregano and cook for about an hour on low heat Pour over spaghetti squash or whole wheat pasta Excellent!",

So - now I post the positives and pray for all of us. I have had no loss of energy during my radiation and I am 26 down with 10 to go.  I exercise everyday, eat fresh fruits and veggies, no dairy, no caffiene, low fat, low sugar.  I splurge one day a week and eat whatever I want. I meditate and spend some time to think of everyone in my life. I stay positive by always remembering those less fortunate than myself.  This works for me.",
