The doctor told me a lot of things about my mass and he said that even biopsy result will be benign they will do another biopsy or surgery to make sure they did not miss anything. I asked him if he thinks its malignant, he said there is a chance that it is and because of my age ( I'm 29 ), he thinks it might be benign. But after the biopsy, the nurse told me that it doesn't look good and hoped that everything will be fine. She even told me to bring my husband when I'll get my result. I am very very scared not of dying but from the possibility that I won't see my 6 month old daughter grow. She needs me and I cant stop crying thinking of her. Pls pray for me and my family!

I wasn't really that scared at first but when she told me that it doesn't look good, I just burst out in tears. The first thing on my mind was my daughter. But I am still hoping and praying that it will be benign.",
