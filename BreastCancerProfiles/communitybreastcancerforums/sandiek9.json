Everything else was under control, but the lack of sleep was unbearable. I am happy to report that I had round 2 of AC yesterday and found I could overpower the effect with Ambien. I went to bed early, watched a movie and popped an Ambien at midnight and slept through the night (with bathroom trips, of course) until 6 am. Don't know if this works for everyone, but it's worth a try!Â ",
