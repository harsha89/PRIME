I have been buying them from the TLC Direct catalog, but they are a little expensive there. In addition to the expense of them, sometimes I receive foam that is more dense than the previous forms. I have even received 2 forms marked the same size and they are not exactly the same size, and one seems to be made with denser foam than the other. I am a little irked at the price, since I am sure they have about $2 (or less) into making them, and I sometimes feel taken advantage of. So, I thought I would see if anyone here has a better place to purchase them. Thanks for any advice or recommendations. I am just buying the foam forms - not weighted - and each one is kind of formed to extend under my armpit a little. They call them unweighted asymmetrical forms. Thanks for any info!

I have blood draws taken out of my foot, and BP on my leg. I have never gotten a flu shot, but last year I had the flu for several weeks and was sicker than I have ever been. So, this year I would like to get a flu shot. Since my Lymphedema is so mild, do you think I can just \"go for it\" and get the flu shot in my arm? Or do others here get the flu shot somewhere else? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
