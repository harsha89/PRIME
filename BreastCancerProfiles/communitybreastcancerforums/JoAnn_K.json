The healing took longer than I expected, and while the plastic surgeon did a great job on one side, the breast that had had radiation did not heal as neatly. For the most part, I ignore the fact that I am flat-chested, and am not as emotionally torn as I was last year. Time is the great healer. At least I am healthy and alive.",

I had planned on implants, but my body rejected the extenders and after a month of fevers, numerous antibiotics and another hospital stay, they were removed. However, the extra skin remained, and I am scheduled for that to be removed on Sept 2nd. Due to other life circumstances, I didn't get the chance to mourn the loss of my breasts until recently, and am very sad about how I look and feel. My husband is extremely supportive and says it doesn't bother him, that he would rather have me alive, than have breasts. From his point of view, it hasn't affected our physical intimacy, but it affects me. I loved my breasts for bringing both of us pleasure and for feeding my babies. I was so busy being happy they were gone, I never considered the aftermath of emotions",
