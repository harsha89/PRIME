The point to remember is since late Monday I also have less shortness of breast and my lung don't do anymore that awfull noise.  ...  So maybe it worth it.",

Had one week off. Chemo no3 was posponed due to low wbc. I'm now at chemo no.5 after another treatment postponed (wbc was .37). But since no.3 I receive 50mg. In resume I had 60, 40, 50, 50 and this week should be 50 too. Two days after the dose I am like Rakulinda -cannot do nothing exept minimal- for 4 days because of pain and fatigue and also depression. But it seems to work, as since the beginning I have less pain due to bone and my breathing improved. Also have Herceptin every 3 weeks and Aredia once a month.",

Tell him that if he has any question not to be shy to come and ask you (or his father), that you are the one who will answer the questions.  Sometime friends of family may say things that will come to his ear and may scare or may think something wrong.   (Hugs)!",
