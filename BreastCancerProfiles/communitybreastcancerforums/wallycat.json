At 34, you are right, the odds are slim you would have cancer and even slimmer that it is IBC. Given the fact that your body responded to antibiotics (cancer does not), it again points to less likely chance that it is cancer. Having said all of that, at 34, you should not be spending your youth fretting about a life-altering disease. MRI is the gold standard (so they say) for finding cancer; biopsy is the gold standard for topical cancers. Find someone willing to order these for you and try to move forward. If something is found, you will be confident that you know your body; if nothing is found, then you need to let go of the worry. Best to you. ",

I personally agree that staging a tumor simply classifies it because docs have guidelines on treatment.  BUT....certain tumors are more aggressive (the grade matters).   My extrapolation of that data is that if a gal foregoes getting checked and has a slow growing tumor, it could be there for 10 years when finally detected.  If she'd found it at year 3, it would be a stage 1 but maybe at year 10, it has grown in size, which forces the hand to classify it at a stage 3.  Similarly, if you have a fast growing tumor, and you wait 10 years....well it could be stage iv  and if you catch it in year 1 or 2, it is a stage 3 because it was a faster grower (mitosis rate) than the first example. To me, grade is more important than stage, and pathology is more important (er/pr status, her2-neu, nodes, etc...)  ......to me the size of the tumor implies how long it took to find.  To that end, it only makes a difference because more aggressive tumors get bigger in less time.",

I had 4 doctors tell me that lumpectomy and rads were more than enough for me, but I know my personality.  I would dread the 6 month follow ups and worry that it is \"breeding\" in the other breast, or worse, a recurrence. I've posted before...I am lucky my DH isn't a boob guy, so my decision was a bit easier. I was a 34D cup and frankly, the only thing I miss about my boobs is the sensation (sexual) and I am quite satisfied with my flat chest...which is why I skipped recon as well. I know many gals who post here and opt for lumpectomy/rads and are decade + survivors, so you have to know YOUR personality and how you will deal with this daily. Again, I know that mastectomy does not mean I may NOT get a recurrence...some gals have posted it happened to them, for me, the mammograms/mris and worry prompted me to yank 'em.  I can see and feel things much easier now.  I was also 1 month shy of 50 at dx, so I didn't (for me, personally) carry a lot of the baggage about what society would think of me going flat....ah, the one good thing about getting old...you don't give a crap about what people think much anymore .

My surgeon (whom I adore and respect very much) insisted on lumpectomy.  He said mastectomy was overkill. I decided to let them do the lumpectomy so I would get a path report and see what I was dealing with. Once the report came back, I politely said to my surgeon \"I hope you won't be mad that I am killing your good work...I still want the bilaterals.\"  He was happy to do it once I met with a plastic surgeon and a radiation oncologist ...so that I was SURE and knew going in that I'd made the right decision. You may want to do the same.  Some gals report a slightly larger breast after rads, others even smaller.  Also, I opted no recon; rads will alter if/when you can get reconstruction done. Yes, it is annoying to go under twice, and the cording and arm raising stretches all over again, but it was the difference of a few months and for me, knowing pathology before I proceeded with bilaterals made me feel more secure.

I am not sure if coding it as \"prophylactic\" would alter the option. Typically, if you have not had any cancer to start, I do not believe they would go from scans to surgery without knowing for sure if it were cancer. In my case, they were positive I did not have cancer; sadly, I did. The biopsy allowed me to move forward.  ",

My eye doctor's wife had a breast biopsy for a suspicious area...the person performing the biopsy missed the lesion they were looking at in the ultrasound...got surrounding tissue. Saved her life since THAT tissue turned out to be cancer. Can you live 25 years with cancer and not have issues...yes.  If there is a slow growing cancer, why not?  Some studies show that auto-accident victims who have been autopsied show some women with BC and they are in their 70s, 80s, etc....did they know?  How long was it there? They are telling men with prostate cancer to watch and wait---something else will get them, so why not other cancers. Dermoid tumors on ovaries are typically b-9, but in a small % (and in older women) they have found cancer cells... Cancer is a crap shoot and the more I read, the more I say finding it is equally crappy!  ",

If they won't do an MRI for you, can you at least request an ultrasound. My lobular was missed on both mammo and ultrasound, but some gals' tumors get picked up.

I had lumpectomy first and then 2 months later, the bilateral mastectomy without recon.  For me, the SNB was the most noticeable part of the whole ordeal.  It took me a few days before I could reach as high as I was used to, but not a big deal.   The nurses all freaked out because I was getting up to go to the bathroom on my own; I bought all the stuff posted here (the big wedge pillow, etc..) and had no use for any of it.  I was lucky the hospital gave me little \"packets\" to hold my drains.  That was the one thing I had not thought of needing or getting. I must say, for as large as my breasts were, my brain adjusted very quickly to \"the new me.\"  Amazing how psychology/brains work.",

The odds are it is nothing.  Even breast lumps, they say 80% of them are b-9.  Coming to a breast cancer BB, of course you are reading everyone who DID have cancer, but not all of those that did not.  MOST breast cancers start in the breast.....so I would ask for a mammogram and a possible MRI.  They say the MRI is the \"gold standard\" for ruling it in or out.  I would also ask for an aspiration if you still have the lump (it is likely to be a sweat gland or a fatty deposit, but around here, we say the only good lump is one in a jar).   Remember that most cancers are years in the making, which means a day or a week is not going to affect your outcome overall. I too was going to suggest your thyroid be checked.  Hyperthyroid can make you drop weight almost overnight.    We hope to hear you post back that you are fine.  Please follow up for peace of mind, but try not to assume it is more than it is. I was one of those gals that had a gut feel; clean mammo, clean ultrasound but got an MRI...and still no pallpable mass.  I am still a stage 1.  Don't overstress as the examinations begin.

You can't compare your healing/recovery to anyone because we are all so different. I think it depends on how much exercise you did prior (just my own belief).

If you find yourself stiff and in pain, go for physical therapy. I ended up having a pinched nerve in my left (non-cancer) side that was sooooooo painful, it was worse than the mastectomy (and I had no pain pills).  I wanted to die and sobbed for 3 days and finally caved in to go to the PT.  Within an hour, the pain was gone!  Plus, she did massages for 6 weeks to get the cording worked out.  By the time she was done, I had full range of motion....that and yoga really helped me.

The healing time depends on how flexible you are and how much you exercised before. Your husband can help with that.

From how I am understanding your posts, you have zero idea if this is invasive or not. If it is DCIS, then there is no rush to do anything. Some studies are saying imaging has gotten so good that many women would walk around for years before DCIS was even diagnosed. Still, they do not know which DCIS will become invasive or stay dormant and just \"be\" there without causing issue. You don't need to make any decisions till you know what you are dealing with. For myself, I chose BMX because I was large breasted and did not want to feel lopsided and always having to wear a prosthetic going out. I did not want recon, so that would have been my only choice. If you choose recon, the odds are that you will require new implants in 10-20 or so years and since you are so young, another surgery would no doubt be in your future. There are recon options that use your own fat, but with 2 small children, you'd have to factor that in. I'm mentioning this because you indicated BMX decision so you won't go through another surgery...so maybe saving a healthy breast and not \"killing it\" (to use your words) is an option. There's no guarantee that you would go on to develop a second breast cancer. Keep us posted on your decision and keep an open mind. The more details and information you have, the easier (sometimes) it is to make the decision. Good luck and so sorry you are here.",

Sadly, waiting is the hardest part of this journey.  I hope your results will be b-9.   You can ask your primary to phone in a rx for valium or some other anti-anxiety med if it is unbearable. I asked for valium after I met with my breast surgeon.  Never needed to take it, but was happy to have it. Best to you.",

I think if I were in my 30's or early 40's, I may have considered reconstruction.  Frankly, I didn't realize I could opt out of reconstruction till my husband said something!  We went to the plastic surgeon together and after our initial discussions and pamphlets,  I was to decide.  As we reached the elevator my DH had a very puzzled look on his face.  \"Am I getting this correctly?\" he asked.  \"They cut a perfectly good pectoralis muscle to put these implants in?\"   He just couldn't wrap his brain on this ....to which I explained that yes, that was how silicone implants are done.  \"And why would any woman do that to herself?\" he asked....this should let you know that my DH is not a boob man (thankfully).  Until his comments, I never even thought that NOT reconstructing is a perfectly good option.   Once I began reading some of the problems that may happen, the pain that may occur and that it would involve another replacement surgery, I knew in my heart that no matter how much I missed my boobs and wished they would be back, I was unwilling to go through all of that to have the look. Many gals are very happy with their decision to have reconstruction, but I guess I'm a very happy girl to be flat. Best to you with your decision.",

      "Content": "Jun 15, 2008 06:24PM - edited Jun 15, 2008 06:27PM by wallycat I am so sorry you are going through this.   Cancer is out of our control. I would urge you to speak to a genetic counselor and maybe a support group. Genetic testing is risky because though carrying a certain gene may predispose you (put you at higher risk) of a disease, it doesn't mean you will get it.  Still, BRCA plus your mother's history certainly puts you at that nasty \"higher risk\" status. Has your doctor talked about Oopherectomy? or did you decide you wanted this on your own?  No one can make decisions about surgeries but you. We can suggest what \"we\" (individually) would do in a similar situation but that doesn't mean it would be right for you. If you were prepared to go ahead with the surgeries, can you reschedule to move things up?  I ended up testing negative for the BRCA1/2 but was prepared to have ovaries and breasts removed.  I ended up just having bilateral mastectomy because of ILC in right breast. It was 1 year on Friday and I have not regretted my decision. I'm a worrier and for me, the peace of mind in risk reduction (though not nil, much less risk) was worth it.  Not everyone is a worrier and not everyone opts for this route. Best to you on this icky journey we women deal with. I will add that I ended up having to wait nearly 2 months to get my MRI and then go back for a second MRI for the biopsy....It is June and if your surgeries are July/August, I would think you could wait.  My only concern is about a second surgery to do SNB because they don't know if it is cancer or not.  Maybe they can do a preliminary rush of the mass and then do the PBM, and then decide on the nodes. Again, best to you! ",
