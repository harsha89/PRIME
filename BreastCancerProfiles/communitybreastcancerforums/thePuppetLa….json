Just see how you feel about driving.  I drive ok--I just make sure I'm not too tired.  They suggest that you have someone drive you for your chemo treatments as you may be a bit sleepy from the meds.  I actually drove myself for the 2nd treatment and it was a 40' drive and I was fine.. hang in there and check in and let us know how you're doing'....ellen",

And I was pleasantly surprised how much easier the 2nd round of chemo was.  No loss of hair and some fatigue and oh, some hand/foot syndrome--but really pretty manageable.I then did rads and was put on arimidex but since I had such knee pain, got switched to Aromasin.",
