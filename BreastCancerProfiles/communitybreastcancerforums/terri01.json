Is it true, after you get the diagnosis, Cancer or no cancer, the emotional seems to get a little better, because at least you know. You can sort of take some kind of control back, treatment decisions etc. The waiting of eternal not knowing of what is instore after the biopsy is he**. I certainly don't want a diagnosis of breast cancer, but I can't take this waiting with my hands tied feeling. I am scared to death I am going to get that phone call, sorry it is cancer when I am at work, at the store, driving. What do I do? Then I fear the next step is what if I make the wrong decision on my treatment, and I have a recurrence. Why do they make you wait so long for the biopsy. Don't they know this is he**. My husband tires to understand, but he gets irritated because he doesn't know why I am so upset before I even have the biopsy. He is calling me Henny Penny and telling me to just stop this. Of course, everyone else just says \"it will be alright\". Somehow these words are not comforting and reassuring. Is it normal to think the worst. Is it some kind of sick self defense mode. If I convince myself this is the real thing, Cancer, then when I hear those words, it won't be so devestating. Help, I am at my worst, I think. I don't know how I will be after the biopsy, waiting for the results, and after hearing my diagnosis. It is an inspirtioni knowing you all have gotten through it, and you all are dealing with it. So, I think women do this all the time. I just don't think I am as strong as you ladies. Thank you for any replies, Terri Log in to post a reply",

I know that I have convinced my friends in the past to go for their annual mammos, and the importance, but I can't seem to convince myself.  My appt is next week, and I have this overhwelming need to just cancel it and pray that it wasnt a mistake. How do you overcome this inappropriate fear, am I the only one!!! Lots of Love, Hugs and Smiles to all you ladies..You are all angels... Terri Log in to post a reply",
