      "Content": "lovelush wrote: After the 1st mammo, last June, I had the ultrasound which found calcifications in my left breast.  This was the one I was concerned about.  I was happy that there wasn't anything really there.  But, the ultrasound was focused on my right breast.  They found something(s) that I can't even remember because I was numb and in shock.  I know they were masses and not cysts or calcifications or something.  They are the reason I am going back every 6 months.  They asked if I wanted a biopsy and I said no, because I was scared.   I was foolish not to get my records, I know.  And that is a priority of mine. The 6 month follow up they took pictures and no ultrasound.  Is that normal?  I was surprised, because they took the ultrasound to find the original findings on my right breast.  Esp. because I was told I have dense breast tissue. I recently found my bra with fluid in the nipple area. I have felt pain in my right breast and my breast has been burning a bit.  Maybe I'm just being a hypochondriac.  My nipples are all gross looking and crusty at the top.  Both.  So, maybe it is just something else. I am going in for another mammo. Do I have the right to request an ultrasound?  Is this the tech's call?  Am I just overreacting?  Should I stay off the internet?  The more I read, minus here (which I found today) the more I begin to freak.
