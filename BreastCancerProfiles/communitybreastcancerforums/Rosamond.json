My uni MX was delayed several hours as the patient before me had an unexpected finding-her SNB tested positive, and they had to do an ancillary dissection. My heart went out to this woman and her family, so I was not bothered at all to wait. I meditated and took a little nap! I did get moved all around the 3 hospitals in the course of the afternoon and evening due to this delay, but it was all good in the end. I woke up and asked the PS resident, \"What happened?\" and he said, \"you got everything you wanted-the cancer out, an implant, and your nipple, too!\" It was a long night of a million and one interns, residents, nurses, and med students unhooking and hooking my surgical corset (felt oddly like a 19th century hooker ;-), and I was able to be discharged by noon. My breast looks like my breast, but like it was flattened and beaten up, but I can see the potential. I have a radial incision on the outer side where the tumor(s) was taken...path report will reveal just how large the IDC mixed in with the DCIS might be. I will definitely need a little revision and a lift on the other side in a few months, but I recognize my skin and my nipple and with the right bras, I will be just fine. Meanwhile...although I've been doing fine with just Advil, the drain tubes in my chest and side are killing me. I'm gonna take some Tylenol 3 before bed. Heal well, sisters!",

I took Ativan to sleep at night as surgery approached but have no need for it right now despite the wait for the surgical path report. I find that recovery from surgery is enough of a mind-occupier. Also, a cardiologist friend gave me a tip pre-surgery. He told me to go into it as stress-free as possible as his experience has been that stressed out patients often end up with complications. To do this, I focused on the important part-getting the cancer removed from my body and releasing some things I wanted to change in my life along with it. Like unplugged, I used meditation as well and counted by breaths. Although my surgery was delayed due to complications with a previous patient, the meditation and positive attitude got me through the 3 hour delay. It really was all completely bearable, and it still is that way. Took my first shower today and feel like a new woman! I am getting used to my lopsided Picasso breasts (can't tell in a bra) and happy to just need Advil for the pain. A tip about stool softener-if you get off the narcotic meds quickly, stop taking it. I eat a high fiber diet, and it ended up giving me stomach cramps and diarrhea! Off it now! Good thoughts for all.",

Up until two days ago, I thought I only had DCIS. The IDC was found after a second biopsy I asked for - thought I might still be able to get a lumpectomy - extensive DCIS, but the real kicker is the IDC shows a high Ki-67 (30%). Chemo will be part of the plan. Trying to stay calm, but it's difficult as I've been in the \"early days\" of diagnosis for 8 weeks now, and news keeps getting worse. I am an elementary principal and the primary wage earner in my family. Worried about not being able to work through an aggressive plan of chemo. Won't get BRCA test back until after surgery. No history of BC or ovarian in family, but my dad and three of his four brothers have had prostate cancer, one in his 50s. This might mean BRCA-2, which also relates to the Luminal B they think I have. A lot to process, and I have to get ready for surgery, too!",

This is not an option for everyone, but having kept my nipple has been important for my healing. I only feel that I've lost the gland and fat inside as my skin and nipple still look like me, and, to my hand's touch, feel like me. I had also decided, prior to my SLN biopsy, that if I couldn't do an implant or needed radiation, that I would go flat on the one side and eventually get a beautiful, organic, healing tattoo. It gave me comfort to think of all the pleasant, aesthetic options - nipple, implant, tattoos. I think vanity is just fine as this is your body, and as a woman, you have the right to feel healed and beautiful. It's part of the journey and can take a long time, but it's important for moving on. One week out from my UMX, I love looking at my new/old breast, despite the nipple having no sensation, and the large, black incision line from my nipple to under my arm. Each of us must make the choices that are best for ourselves and our health, but I truly believe that if you embrace the choices and are open to possibilities, there will be beauty (and, yes, sometimes vanity) that can help you heal on your journey. I know you will make the best decision for you. All the best. (((HUGS)))",

Some tightness and soreness still, but really, all in all, pain-free. That said, I can still tell that the insides need time to fully heal as itching and twinges are common. Taking it easy and relishing the fact that my assistant principal is taking care of all the headaches caused by the first day of school (I'm an elementary principal)...but I am looking forward to going back to school sooner than later as I know seeing all the kids will be very energizing and life-affirming. Sometimes, I feel completely like my old self and have moments in the day where I \"forget\" what happened. And this is only Day 12 post-surgery. I tell this to all of you awaiting surgery to let you know that it does get better. It might take 12 days or 12 weeks, but we women are resilient, strong, and adaptable.

This \"mass\" could be many things that are benign in nature. You won't really know anything until the biopsy results, and the waiting is excrutiatingly painful, I know. I was diagnosed with DCIS through a stereotactic biopsy following a diagnostic mammogram in mid-June. During the past month and a half, I have had an MRI and an additional biopsy - should get results tomorrow - and am in the process of a second opinion. The early days of diagnosis are like nothing else - filled with shock and disbelief and outright fear. Although my MRI did not find any additional areas of concern, it did show a greater area of involvement than mammography, and that is why I had the biopsy. I suspect that the result will be more DCIS, and then I will move on to a mastectomy, rather than a lumpectomy. But, there is also a chance that the biopsy could show something invasive (or that my final pathology report after surgery will do so). It is scary, indeed, but I finally came to the realization that if there is something in there that is invasive, or there is more of something (DCIS) that needs to be removed, well, I am grateful for the technology that can tip off the docs so the bad stuff can be addressed and treated. Keep breathing, and try to stay busy. The chance of contralateral (other breast) cancer is fairly low - about 3%, I think. It does happen, but, remember, the MRI was not only for surgical planning,  but also for the docs to do their due diligence with the goal of having you healthy and thriving in the future.  Wishing you all the best.",

      "Content": "Feb 2, 2018 04:32PM - edited Feb 2, 2018 04:37PM by Rosamond I posted on Facebook to my own network only, and it was the easiest way to inform and update extended family and friends. I used a mix of facts and humor and found out from both comments and private messages that there were a lot more survivors and friends and families of survivors in my network than I ever realized. I'm over 4 years out now and still celebrate milestones with my network - one friend hit the 10 year mark after Stage 3 yesterday. Like a previous poster said, there is no one right way to communicate and inform. I am a social person who thrived on all of the support from friends and family and colleagues that was afforded to me through social networking as well as live contacts. What saddened me were the people I encountered who made it known to others that they thought I should keep my breast cancer private, as if it was shameful or showed weakness. Thankfully, this was a small minority as most people thanked me for my openness and shared with me how much they appreciated my honesty and forthrightness with my journey. My advice is to do whatever feels right for you, and that will be the right thing to do. All the best",
