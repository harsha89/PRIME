But no matter what stage, this SUCKS!! Dr's say I 'won the breast cancer lottery' - to me, not getting BC would be winning, but I guess I am lucky to not have progressive cancer. I'm a single mother with 3 girls, dx 7/2010. Had lumpectomy 9/2010, and had unclear margins as Dr's found a whole other tumor. Thankfully it ended up being dcis, but I also had an invasive lobular 1.3cm tumor that was er+..... So, double mast 10/2010 with tissue expansions for a very long time. Thankfully also no lymph node involvement..... Finally had those torture devices removed and implants placed in July 2011....almost 1 yr later. My oncotype score was 18. I tried tamoxifen and pretty much lost my mind on it. Now we are trying Lupron injections and AI's. I just turned 36 and have terrible fear of it coming back... I did manage to escape chemo and rads, and I am trying to educate myself on the SE's/pro's/cons of my current treatments. Here's the fun fact I'm also studying...I have no family history, but had the Mirena birth control for 6 yrs, Dr's are now zeroing in on the fact that this could have been the cause and major contributing factor! God Bless all of you and keep on fighting!!!!",
