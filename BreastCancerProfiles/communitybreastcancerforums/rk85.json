Is your breast care coordinator an assertive type or is she also just going through the moves?  I got one who seemed to want to do the least possible work, so she scheduled one appointment for me and I haven't heard from her in weeks.  Although I hate to do this myself, do you feel strong enough to be assertive with the doctors and tell them you are worried and really need to get an answer from them quickly?  Sometimes we have to be our own advocate.",

At that point, radiation of nodes may become a good option.  From what I have read and heard from my PS, radiation and implants do not mix well.  Also, she will not do a DIEP if radiation is possible because some studies suggesting women who have had DIEP have a higher rate of recurrence of BC after radiation (maybe because the flap interferes with the radiation reaching the nodes properly?).  So once again I go back to Dr. K's fat grafting procedure, because although it works betters without the radiation, it seems to be the best choice.  The stem cells in the fat may also help to repair some of the damage caused by the radiation. Hope this helps, and I'm off for my daily swim/wallow in the POWI (pit of waffling indecision). ",

Dukes Up, you, me and Rachel are bringing up the end of the month with BMX surgeries on the 24, 25 and 26.  How old is your son and where will be he be while you are in the hospital?  My sons are 13 and 6, and we were really bracing ourselves for the big C talk with them, but they took it in stride.  Kids haven't associated cancer with all the horrible ideas we associate with that word, because they usually haven't seen it in action.  So their reaction is a reflection of how you are appearing to them - calm or freaked out, scared or resolute, or sometimes all of the above!  Hopefully our kids' experience with cancer will be to watch their mothers fight it with grace and dignity, and live a long time afterword.",

I'm assuming they did the SNB at the same time as the excisional biopsy.  I wish there was a way for them to test the actual cells they found in the nodes to see whether they were DCIS cells or actual invasive cells.  From what I understand, there is a subtle molecular change the DCIS must undergo before it can actually break out of the basement membrane and be capable of metastasizing.  Why can't they test your cells to know for sure?  My question/concern is will the pathologist make slides of and look at ALL your MX tissue to know for sure whether there is mircoinvasion or do they just do a representative sample?  How can you know for sure?  At least you have the benefit of knowing ahead of time that a node was positive so maybe you can ask about really really thorough analysis of your MX tissue.  Those of us having SNB at the same time as MX won't know about a few cells in the nodes until final path comes back a week later when the rest of our removed boobs are long gone. Have you looked into the difference between rads vs. AND if someone has a positive sentinel node?  I thought i would prefer rads but now I'm not so sure.  If the lymphedema risks are the same, maybe AND is better.  At least the lungs and surrounding tissue aren't at risk from the 'gift that keeps on giving' as I've heard rads described.   Sorry if it feels like I'm pouncing on you with a barrage of probing questions.  Feel free to answer any/none!  It just helps me to actually think this out, and hopefully helps others in the same situation.  ",
