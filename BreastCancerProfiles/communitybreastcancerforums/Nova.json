They are going to do the SNB at the same time. They also didn't do the HER2 test or hormone receptor test when they did the biopsy before Thanksgiving. They said that will take about a week to get back. We just found out last week that they let you heal a bit before starting chemo.",

Our biggest concern is going to be where she is most comfortable... The doctor's were leaning towards a mastectomy but gave her the choice between lumpectomy and mast. Her biggest concern of the entire situation was reconstruction, not necessarily if to have it but would it be good enough??? She is horribly afraid of the scars and the body she will be left with. Once she told the doctor today what she decided he told her that her oncologist and he talked and both felt that would be the best route for her. We managed to get a load of information and after her visit with the plastic surgeon she was convinced of what she felt was right for her. She wants this surgery over with. She found out 9 weeks ago about this. We have changed doctors because she wasn't comfortable with the first set. She has made it really clear she is ready to get this done. Now our taskÂ is the prepping for everything. One person compared it to getting ready for a trip... that's just how we feel right now. I feel like she was handling everything fine so far. Now she is a bundle of nerves. We are looking up all kinds of stuff and going through her clothes tonight. Then we'll make a \"list\" and get what we need. We feel so overwhelmed with the fact that there doesn't feel to be \"control\" over the situation which is not in either one of our natures to deal with!!",

My Mom has decided to go with the mastectomy with reconstruction for her IDC - While this is what the doctor's were pushing her to do we are still very worried... naturally. Question for today is.... what do I need to get for her to make her as comfortable as possible? Anything special she should be eating? Is she going to be out of it for a few days? Should she be sitting up or lying down? Special clothing needed? Medical supplies that we should have on hand? They said she will be bandaged up afterwards for a few days and she will have some tubes for a few days??? Any advise is appreciated. Hugs to everyone. Log in to post a reply",
