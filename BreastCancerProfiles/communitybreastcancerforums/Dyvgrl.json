I myself had the testing done as I have several people on my maternal side with breast cancer. Fortunately for me, my test came back negative. But if it had come back positive, I would've done a BMX in a heart beat. I want this gone and not hanging over my head for the rest of my life. I will also be having a hysterectomy when this is all said and done. We all have choices whether we've been diagnosed with cancer or not. Insurance is required by law since 1998 to pay for reconstruction. It is up to you to find a surgeon that is good enough to perform a decent procedure. The best thing I can tell anyone is get yourself educated. Be very picky about the surgeons you choose. I live in Alaska where there are few options and I considered going outside - money is a big issue, but I did some research and found a team that has the skill and the talent to do a good job. I'll be having my UMX on the 23rd with recon scheduled Jul 2 assuming I need no rads or chemo. We'll see. Either way, I'll roll with it and as I've gone through this procedure, I've made my choices by talking alot to my surgeons (there are 3 on my team) and my oncologist, reading reading and more reading, and deciding what works best for my lifestyle. That's all any of us can do. Lily - I think you are just really pissed off you have cancer, and aren't happy with the results you've had with your treatments - I totally understand it - and I feel you - but directing it at AJ serves no purpose. We all have to make peace with this demon otherwise we'll be miserable a whole lot longer.",

I did 4 dd AC and 2 Taxol and quit. Hoping the hair won't be such a big issue because I didn't do the last 10 treatments...",
