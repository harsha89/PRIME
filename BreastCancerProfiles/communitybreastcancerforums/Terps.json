Did a check and found a definite lump. I do regular self checks so knew this was new and different. Feels oblong and fairly solid. Had a mammo less than a year ago that was normal. Had a well woman check up a month ago, including breast exam, and it was also normal. Went to my PC Friday and she confirmed the mass. I'm going for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound a week from Monday. I need to keep busy until then, this is a bit distracting. I'm trying not to worry. I don't have pain, but it's definitely tender at times. I also feel some heaviness and a similar sensation when I was nursing and milk would come in. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. Thanks so much!!! Log in to post a reply",
