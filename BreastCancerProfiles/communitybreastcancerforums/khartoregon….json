Anyway, it depends on your boss and it sounds like your boss wants you there. So that's in your favor! The only thing I'm finding is that some days I don't want to be here, but those are the days when I don't want to be anywhere, so it's not the job so much as my energy level.  But if I could do this 3 days a week ... man, that would be brilliant.  So I think you've got a pretty good set-up there and I say you go for it.

People also don't understand that just because you can't \"beat\" it doesn't mean you can't keep living your life.  I'm still - still - getting advice not to take my new position here at the office because of the cancer, and I feel fine.  Even if I can only do this job for 6 months, that's 6 months of working and good insurance and being a regular person like anyone else out there.  Give us that publicity, you Sheryl Crow people!  I'm here.  I have cancer.  I'm still here. We fight this every day and the battle isn't to beat it, but to live with it and that is the struggle that they need to acknowledge.  We live with it knowing it's not going away, but we still get up and contribute to the world every day that we can.  The sooner medical science can make those days last longer the better.  They need to get on it. Oh and I am wearing pink today, but it's only because it matches the blue-green in my skirt.",

      "Content": "Sep 24, 2010 05:08PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:48AM by khartoregon Suzy, I come from a family where getting an MRI is like dabbling in witchcraft.  Last week, while I was visiting my parents, I was taking vicodin so I could sleep through the night and my father barked at me that \"pills were for druggies!\" Good thing I'm at a point where that actually made me laugh (\"Oh, Pop, for heaven's sake...\"). Anyway, I'm not a druggie, but if I don't calm my bone pain and my crazy thoughts for at least a few hours a night, I'm not going to be doing my overall health any favors.  I'm also afraid of getting hooked, but I think that the realization that it could turn into something I can't put down is what will keep me from dependency.  I only take it when I need it, and, yes, some weeks that's every day.  But sometimes I can actually skip a few days and I know my body enough to know when to stop and when to start.  If that changes, well, then I guess I'll be a druggie. But there's no reason in the world why you should be expected to live your life in pain.  Or I haven't found a reason yet anyway.  If someone comes up with one I guess I'll give it a go.  Until then, you have a right to live your life without crying. (Oh, yes, sorry, just to add -- I don't have LE.  Sorry, but, sure, I do understand pain.  You bet.)",

Slight lesion my left eye.  This thing was too strong to be slight anything! Anyway, fast forward a few days and onc throws me on steroids to up my counts for chemo and pain goes away.  So, I don't know what it was, but steroids knocked it out pretty quickly. For all the lack of anything at Urgent Care, they did do a pee test and confirmed for me that at least it wasn't my liver or gall bladder.  Not much comfort to know they couldn't figure out what it was, but at least I know I've still only got bone mets.  It might be worth a trip to your primary care doc or Urgent Care (at least you'll get dilaudid).",
