I have not been a milk drinker since I was a kid but it tastes strangely good to me now, so the body must know what it needs. Just keep those spreadables handy! - Skye",

I don't think my brows and lashes have thinned but here is a weird leg hair thing...I shaved them over a week ago and it hasn't grown back!

There is simply not enough time to mentally process everything...and we are constantly coming up against other people's pre-conceived notions as to how they think we should be feeling or acting. Even just last week the hub and I were sitting down to dinner and it hit me, and I said, You know I just can't believe I have breast cancer and getting chemotherapy...as I took an anti-nausea pill and adjusted my \"house-hat.\" It just doesn't compute. What I relate to least are the \"pity-looks\" and for some reason, people from my church are the worst for that. Do they think it makes them look sympathetic? Holy? I don't know but it makes me want to smile brightly and tell a knock-knock joke or something. These are never the people who actually call or send cards, either. Not to judge them, but someone ought to run a seminar on things NOT to do with cancer patients. So, a pox on the pity-look! That's my rant. - Skye",

I know the exercise is supposed to help but there are only a few days out of each cycle that I'm able to manage any. And then it's just very light aerobics.

Dar, LOL, when I was in Wal-Mart last week I realized there were two whole aisles of things for hair that I now have no need for. However, I've become intensely interested in the hat and scarf aisle, and my collection is growing. My sis who used to work for a motorcyle co. gave me a couple of do-rags. They are not flattering alone but work great under cotton, brimmed hats for a little extra coverage. Mizsissy, something I am taking that is supposed to stimulate hair return is nettle leaf tea. It's also a good immune stimulant. There is a book I have called Breast Health the Wise Woman Way. It is outdated medically and I think has some extreme views about conventional treatment but it also has recommendation on supplements to support your immune system and organs during the different kinds of chemo. I picked some of what seemed like the safest things and have been using them with my onc's blessing. Author Susun S. Weed (how perfect is that name?) Again, key is informing your team. There may be something to the nettles because my brows and lashes haven't even thinned after 4 AC and I'm just starting to get some new growth on the back of my head. (I hope the rest of it gets new growth too or I'll end up with a comb-over mullet). Another book I'd recommend for those with hubs or partners is \"Breast Cancer Husband\" by Marc Silver, one who has been there. It covers everything from sex during chemo to not expecting your wife to look like the glam models in the TLC catalog when she puts her first turban on. My guy is not a reader but he is reading this one and it has helped him a lot. Hey yesterday I saw my first sandhill cranes of the season, a pair of them winging over a nearby field. Now it's officially spring! - Skye",

Of course, I was sound asleep for almost four hours from the 500mg Benadryl, waking up every hour to pee and then conking right back out. Here I had my laptop and thought I'd get all this work done. Not! I was glad my neighbor had come to fetch me, I was still way too groggy to drive home. So far I feel ok other than that. However, I have to tell you ladies that my onc was NOT happy when I proudly told him I did the 40-minute walk/kickbox tape. He said it could mess up my potassium levels and to only do 10-15 minutes at a time. He was fine with walking the mile and a quarter. And he is both a kind and very competent oncologist; my nursing team is also wonderful. Mizsissy I'm so sorry you got such a callous team but there are good ones out there. Mine make up for the crummy, crowded infusion room. And I was actually surrounded by some people I could talk to today but when the Benadryl hit I just went out like an old light bulb. At least I sure am rested. Rebecca and everyone on the fight topic, here's my take. I don't see it so much as an aggressive fight as a take charge, be proactive, long-range process. It's one reason I researched the herbal supplements; they may not be for everyone but they were one thing I could do that I knew the doctors would not bother with, and that I know from having fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue can really be helpful (again, only ones approved by the doctor) and thus it feels like something that gives me back a little power. Writing a funny blog on myspace is another thing, meditating, and trying to live in a state of grace where I ultimately surrender my disease to God rather than surrending to the disease are other proactive ways I cope. I'm sure everyone does this in some unique way. And if family or friends offer to help, I accept. My friend Janet who has had bladder cancer for ten years told me right away that if someone wants to do something for you, you should let them. And although it's contrary to my nature, I try to remember that. One of my wonderful neighbors brought me home from the Taxol treatment today, and another is bringing me a frittata she made for supper. I'll find ways to repay them. But right now I'm just grateful.One other thing...the broken butterfly image hit home. The other night I dreamed there was a broken hummingbird (broken was the exact word used) and the police asked me how to deal with it. I said it had to be set free. I realized the hummingbird symbolized myself of course. Thanks everyone for the discussion on these deeper aspects of our treatment. And oh yeah, the weight loss...I'll be danged if I'm buying bigger jeans. I gained a half pound this week so I'm cutting down on those scones! - Skye",

My onc told me that the reason my cold sore was taking so long to heal was the low WBC count. He also told me today that I'll be on Herceptin for a year...they do TWO years in Europe! And that he thinks overall I'm tolerating the chemo \"remarkably well.\" He said he thinks that is probably partially to do at least some of the supplements I'm on, and that he wishes he knew which ones they were! This was my last AC/cytoxin treatment, yay, but it's hitting me harder this time already. I'll be glad to go on the Taxol/Herceptin round. And Viddie, I also wonder whether I take my temp too often. But I do think if the spikes go at all over where they have been for either of us, that we should run to the ER in a heartbeat. - Skye",

Also avoiding citrus, vinegar, spicy foods, tomato and alcohol helps very much. Slippery elm bark tablets also soothe and coat. Sure it's a bother but it's so worth not getting sores.

The nasal lining gets zapped along with all the other \"mucosa\" including the upper portion of your throat. I was having a sore throat too until I started gargling with the warm, mild salt water as well as rinsing my mouth after eating. It's very soothing and also helps get rid of that strange phlegm that I think causes the chemo cough. It's one of the most helpful tips I've had. And I'm also glad you got the new nurse. We do have to stand up for ourselves. Hope things are better from now on.- Skye",
