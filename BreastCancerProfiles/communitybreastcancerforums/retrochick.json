I've lost over 5 pounds since then, even though I've been exercising less due to the heat. I'm trying to figure out if this is because of the radiation or whether I'm losing weight that the chemo was keeping on. My appetite has been okay, but I'm getting fuller quicker. Lord knows...I'm not complaining...just more curious than anything. I see my RO tomorrow and am going to ask him about it as well.  BTW, today I completed rad 18/33.  ",

I've been sleeping more than normal, but I think it is just me letting go of the pre-rad anxiety.  About the co-pays, please don't be shy about asking for financial assistance from your hospital. Also, talk to the hospital social worker about not-for-profit organizations that can help pay some of your costs. My husband and I received discounts from the hospital and financial help from the American Cancer Society. So far, my cancer has cost us about $6000...and that's not counting secondary costs like camisoles, mileage, etc. Cancer is expensive.  Hope this helps!  ",
