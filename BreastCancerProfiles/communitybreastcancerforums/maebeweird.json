I expected the result 8 days later like last time but got it only 3 days (not including weekend) later... which is today. The result is not fibroadenoma, it is PASH, which is benign but I will be going in to have it fully removed anyway.",

      "Content": "maebeweird wrote: I feel the need to write out my experience, It's been a hell of a 2 month period. Not even a full 2 months. It's long, and rambly, and includes non-bc scare stuff as well. ----- Aug 22 I went to the ER thinking I had a kidney infection. Funny how it started with that. Follow up doctor said no i think its kidney stones, go have a cat scan right after the appointment. Kidneys were perfectly healthy but gallbladder, liver and spleen looked odd. Ultrasound two days later found gallstone, 2 tumors in my liver and an enlarged spleen. MRI the next day ruled the liver tumors as benign (hematoma and hyperplasia) and decide my spleen is nothing to worry about. Sends me to a surgeon for my gallstone. Got in on sept 14, scheduled removal for oct 16. Got family history and was concerned about my mom having breast cancer so young (I'm 35, mom was only a few years older). Does a breast exam and says \"Before your surgery you need to get a mammogram to rule out anything we need to focus more attention on.\" I had not had one yet as all other doctors told me to start at 35 and my birthday was in september. ----- So I go to the mammogram, it went perfectly fine, and the tech tells me to expect a call back for more, which is totally normal in a first timer. Especially one with dense breast tissue as I have. Google had already told me as much. Second mammogram \"wait here while I see of the radiologist is content\", totally normal. They said the same after everything I've done there. Comes back \"i need to get some more views of both breasts\" ok... do that. I get it, dense tissue, wanna be super sure, right? Goes to check with the radiologist. \"He would like you to get an ultrasound. The room should be ready in a moment\" Sitting there waiting, messaging my mom to let her know \"yep they are doing ultrasound just like you hoped, to be extra sure\" Hers was missed on mammogram and found on ultrasound. Get in and new tech says she needs to look at 3 spots, two on the right and one on the left. I know they aren't usually allowed to tell you the results then and there, but on the right side both of them she said \"yep, thats just a lymph node\" got to the left side and she changed the subject to my kids and whatnot. I was watching the screen and a bit concerned myself because it wasnt just an oval like the other side and when she switched to color doppler it had a spot inside of it light up, as well as around one edge. The other side wasnt like that. She went to get the radiologist and said \"he will probably want to come in and speak with you\" Well, crap. That's never happened before. Sure enough he comes in with this unbelievably cheery attitude. Like seriously unbelievable, even then I thought it was fake but thought maybe he was having a bad day and trying to hide it or its his pokerface for all patients or something. Tells me \"oh its probably nothing, probably a fibroadenoma, but I'd like you to get a biopsy ASAP\" Well, I had a flight back home for my brother-in-laws wedding in less than 12 hours so we scheduled it for a week later, the day after I got back. That wedding was so beautiful and so very, very good at keeping my mind off the biopsy. The whole plane ride home, however, was another story. At this point I was still pretty positive. Radiologist says it is probably nothing, I'm good, right? I mean... Birads 4 is generally not cancer. Go in for the biopsy and the radiologist and tech are super chatty, until the ultrasound finds the lump. \"Ok,\" I think \"these people are just super professional and I'm totally on board with that\" Radiologist says hes taking a few more samples to be sure. \"Ok,\" I said, \"I'd rather that than to need another biopsy!\" I said that. I meant that. I guess I jinxed that. Got my results last night online. \"Benign breast tissue consistent with fibroadenoma\" I flip. I start messaging everyone that knew about my biopsy. We celebrated.. As soon as the hospital opened this morning I get a phone call. Radiologist says exactly what the report says... But then says it wasn't what he expected. He wants to do another biopsy. Soonest I could is wednesday... so heres to another two weeks waiting for the results and hoping like hell Im trick or treating with the knowledge that it truly is nothing. Well, my gallbladder removal has been moved to Dec 4 since a biopsy 2 days after that surgery is just not a good idea. I don't even know what to think now. Log in to post a reply",
