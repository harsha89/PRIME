    "Content": "BreastCancerInMinneapolis wrote: Hi all! I'm a new metster. I'm 35 with no family history of breast or gynecological cancers (we have had other cancers in the family, including my mother who died of multiple myeloma two years ago). I have been diagnosed de novo with metastatic breast cancer: one small lesion on my liver, and what are suspected to be lesions in my lungs (they were too small to be biopsied). I am currently in my first cycle of goserelin (Zoladex), letrozole (Femara) and Ibrance (palbociclib). This is all very unexpected. The good news is that I'm totally asymptomatic from the breast cancer--my side effects are coming from the meds. So here's the real kicker: I just returned from genetic counseling today. The blood tests revealed no gene abnormalities like BRCA (along with many others they tested). But I just got a call from my 34-year-old sister. Due to my age, she decided to have a mammogram and breast MRI done--and the breast MRI revealed a small suspicious spot that needs to be biopsied--her report said birad 4, which I guess means a 30% chance of cancer. (I don't know what score mine was--the radiologist told me as soon as he saw the mammogram and ultrasound images that he knew I had breast cancer and that the biopsy was a formality.) So my question is: what are the odds of breast cancer striking two sisters at the same time? Considering how surprised everyone was that I am metastatic, I'm hesitant to talk over odds, but has this happened to anyone else? Thanks, and I am so glad this community exists. Happy New Year!
