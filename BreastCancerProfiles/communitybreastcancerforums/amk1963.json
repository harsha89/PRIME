Had my biopsy this Monday and the results will not get in till next week / Wday - a long waiting time I think. Had the mammo & ultrasoundÂ 4 weeks ago with no indication anything was wrong. They found two lumps ( not big by any means)0,5 & 0,9mm. The Radiation Dc said it was cancer, but not aggressive. ( How could he tell) and referred me on to biopsy. That went OK except some heavy bleeding on one of the last takings, but they think they got enough to make a DC. I hope. The waiting time is the \" vacation in hell\". It goes on forever, it feels like it anyway! But I know that somehow the Tunnel is over, light will appeared and the road will seem more smooth somehow. Hang in there. Remember that 80% of us will survive and remind yourself the you will be a premium member of the 80% group. My advice is read a lot about the different options you have treatment vice, but stay away from the sites that tells you all the gruesome details and do not listen to peoples \" my neighbours nieces friend - story unless it`s a bright -and-shiny -star -story. You will be in my prayers. Hugs, Gitta",
