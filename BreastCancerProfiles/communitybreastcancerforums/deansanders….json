I went to this cancer show last labor day weekend  in universal city hollywood called cancer control society. Then I paid for the bus tour to Tijuana, Mexico. I initially thought this was all a scam in Mexico. I was wrong. This is the only place to go to save your life. The tour showed the top 8 clinics in Tijuana. Prior to this tour, I was so doubtful about Tijuana as a dangerous city. Well, these clinics, really small hospitals, has state of the art German made equipment and very highly intelligent doctors that have published research. I now know that Tijuana Mexico is the cutting edge place for cancer treatment. In a short posting, I will tell you what I found out that is working that is cutting edge that you won't ever see at your HMO. Believe me, I spoke to many returning patients, maybe like 20 returning patients all from different clinics, most were stage 4 and given months to live that are now cancer free or under remission. 1 lady told me she had 2 weeks to live and came to Tijuana as a last resort, that was 9 years ago. She now volunteers I think to help others. Most of these people went to Tijuana after unsuccessfully doing chemo and radiation in the USA.  Really I was surprised. I talked everyone I could, to get the real opinion. I talk to one man from the east coast that said that he should have been dead and yet could now walk after 3 weeks of treatment and getting better. Here is what the different clinics do that seems to be working. You will never see this, or hear this anywhere but in Germany or Tijuana mexico. So don't even both to ask your USA doctor about this, all the USA does in chemo, radiation and surgery and put you in a body bag This is the main stuff that interested me. 1.whole body hyperthermia- slighly heat the blood using a german made , very expensive machine. At one clinic I spoke the doctor that is in charge of this, and he is a genius and explained heating the blood a few degrees higher will kill off or weaken the cancer, It is used with the other therapies below . 2.IPT- insulin potentiation therapy - lower blood sugar , weaken cancer since it thrives on sugar, then give very very High dose of IV vitamin C, like 60 grams with DMSO and B17  to kill cancer. SOme used an over the counter supplement too called polmva (i dont know what this is exactly, I will be researching) 3. Using UV light to kill of blood pathogens 4. Ozone - using ozone to kill the cancer cells. or Peroxide H2o2 6. Iscador,not sure but this works what ever it is 7. Transfer factors to boost immune system and it make white cell count go down. They do this via IV. They also have pill form too.  8. If they do use chemo, it is 5% the dose used after IPT, the different clincs protect the rest of the body and organs , it is basially a new concept in Chemo and seems to work well with IPT. 9. Organic Coffee Enemas to detox the liver- , not drunk, only as an enema 10. the Diet at these clincs was similar, raw vegetable carrot juice, fruits and vegetables, maybe fish, no meet (Follow the dr. max Gerson diet and budwig diet 11. Hyperbaric oxygen if needed 12. Half of the clinics make what they call dendritic vaccines that use your blood sample and make a vaccine to attack the cancer. 13. Root canals- A top US dentist and several mexican dentists spoke and said there is a strong link to root canals and breast cancer. U can google this to find out more info, very interesting. Something I never knew. The clinics remove root canals once the patient gets stronger. They also remove amalgam mercury fillings too. After this presentation and the data they showed, I will be removing all mercury fillings and 2 root canals this year 14. Rife machine - only 4 out of the 9 clinics use this. Use Rife frequencies to kill cancer cells, These that I spoke too have claimed to have good results and good data to back up their work.  I found out that the dietary aspect is totally ignored by orthodox treament.  The clinics I visited all understand the whole body approach, the diet is a key factor to stay cancer free. Again, a lot of them are using the dr. Max Gerson diet to keep the person cancer free once the treatment is done to remove the cancer. 15. Water- the water recommended by about half the clinics there was distilled water , the patient must take a good  pure naturally dervived mineral supplemenation. 16. Drink ozone water, 4 cups per day too.  17. Half of the clinics had swimming pools, no chlorine in them, only hydrogen peroxide. The tour was done by the cancer control society in Los angeles . Good luck, it changed my whole outlook and I will never visit a US hospital for cancer treatment if I or a love one ever had cancer. The only draw back, these clincs average 20 k per total treatment. So that rules out most of the Mexican population and only Westerners can afford it. This upset me. But, after talking to these doctors, many American by the way , who are forced to practice in Mexico, and hearing the stories from patients there, this is the only hope to healthy treatment. US CHemo will kill you in 2 yrs. GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOOD LUCK, CANCER IS A TERRIBLE DISEASE THAT DESTROYS FAMILIES . BTW, I am not going to respond to the posts that will surely follow like the lady who got chemo in the USA and is still here. THat is great news, u are lucky, most are not and the death toll is huge. Cancer spreads fast, and in most cases comes back, that is why these clinics put people on strict raw juice diets and little meat. Again, I was really amazed by the intelligence and love these clinics have. ,  From what I saw and the countless people I spoke to in Mexico, the patients, mexican and usa doctors on this tour, the bottom line, If you have stage iv cancer i.e., breast cancer, your only hope is germany or Tijuana (why do u think farrah facet went to Germany? she could easily have gone anywhere here in the usa),   So those of you that got chemo here in the USA, I doubt that most had stage iv and bone metastisis and to lungs and liver and I doubt most are able to live a fully normal life. The people I spoke to , many were stage iv and sent home die and Tijuana saved their lives and are functional and look good and are not toxic. So u need to stop giving people false hope about chemo. The statistics don't lie. Most people in tijuana had heavy chemo in the USa where even their eye lashes fell out and they told me they wanted to die because of the chemo Those of you that won't keep an open mind and see that Tijuana is your only hope, go read the story I recently read about make up artist heir:  Max factor's son, who was terminal, couldn't walk and was told he would die in months. He was one of thousands successfully treated in Mexico. Like I said, I was a real big skeptic and doubter, until this tour. Go do your own homework like I did. . Don't depend on others, or some negative, non religious person or HMO doctor that gives you a death sentence. YOu need to take care of yourself and act fast. Do your own homework. U need to take charge.  Too many people find excuses. Time is not on your side. Too many negative people out there.   GOod luck and and God bless u all, I have spoken honestly as I can. This is my opinion based on my experience. I am sharing info from what i saw and the people i talked to. and I am not a doctor and I am not telling u what to do and you should get medical advice that you think will help u. Again, no medical advice is implied here, just my opinion about my changed experiences.",
