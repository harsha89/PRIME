A few mets were gone, largest (1.5 cm) had not grown and others ( 2 smaller than .8mm) had shrunk. Main thing there was nothing new. I also have 1 met to my sternum and 1 to my hiler node. There are more options than there use to be for TN now. When CMF (and I know it will be when not if) stops working I have asked my ONC to look into the PDL-1 trial (immunotheraphy). I know if that doesn't work we still have many more chemo's to try. So there is promise.....main thing is to try and have a positive attitude! We are here for her and you! Julie",

That all ended in May of 2014 and in May 2015 we found the metastasis. Not sure why the Doctors choose different treatment for the same type of BC. I actually changed Oncologists since my original diagnosis. I changed to one that my daughter wanted me to see. My daughter Manages one of the Units at a Hospital and she has a close relationship with one of the Oncologists that has patients on her unit. They have talked about my diagnosis and treatment since day one. The other Oncologist was going to have me do a different treatment than the Taxol. I am early in the game of metastatic BC, you have played so much longer than I and give me the Hope for continued success. You are an inspiration! ",

I was started on Taxol when diagnosed Stage IV May 2015. But it stopped working last year in October so we moved to CMF. I have been on it nearly 10 months and have been stable. My tumor markers have also been stable. When this chemo stops being effective (which we know someday it will stop) and then we will move on to the next. I still feel l as good as I did 16 months ago. In fact I just returned from a 6 day road trip from Texas to Minnesota and back with my sister to visit relatives and my dads grave. My sister suffers from manic depression and had a really bad day on the day we started back for Texas so I drove the entire first day from Minneapolis to Oklahoma City. I guess my message is keep as positive an attitude as you can and live life! Hey Phyllis, welcome to the group!😊 What will they be operating on? Hey Donna, I know what you mean! Every time I get my blood drawn I worry the counts will be too low for chemo. I have been blessed so far and had some close calls...it is just as important that our counts are good. Hang in there!!

Will have a chemo holiday until after Thanksgiving then we start. I am good with this...CMF kept me stable for a year. I still feel great...so not worried about this change. ONC wants to stay with platinum based chemo for now then on to others. Havelan was the other choice but she wants to save for later. I did actually have one met decrease...but not enough to out weigh the progression. Hope everyone has a good weekend. It is still nice here in central Texas so we will spend a lot of time on the patio enjoying the evenings",

We sail in September from Germany to Hungary. Aimee...welcome back to the boards. I haven't done Xeloda but the F in my CMF cocktail is similar to Xeloda. There is a discussion board that is solely about Xeloda. Maybe someone on that discussion can help. Where are your mets? What other chemos have you been on? Julie ",

It is treatable and women do reach NED (no evidence of disease) or stable...which is where I am after 15 months. As TN we will be on some sort of chemo for the rest of our lives or possibly immunotherapy. So...with the above being said. You can definitely live life as stage IV. I worked full time as an HR Manager until 2 weeks ago when I decided to retire at 54 with my husband. We have been on several trips over the past 15 months and have several more planned in the next few months including our retirement celebration down the Danube River on Viking River Cruises. I plan my life around my scans. My last scan showed stable and my next scan is end of October. So life is good for these next three months. I made a decision not to live cancer but to live life!

Talk to your ONC about it. Several months ago suddenly it hurt every time I took a a deep breath...after a couple days it went away, the next time I saw my ONC I mentioned it to her...she responded with, remember not all aches and pains are from your cancer. Some are just normal everyday body changes. I guess for some reason I thought everything was because of my cancer. I forgot that I can have issues just like all the non cancer people in the world.

They are going to get some of my biopsied tumor from my ONC and see if I am eligible. She also talked about a few other trials, and referred me to another ONC in Dallas who could also see if I am eligible for any of her trials.I meet with her next Tuesday. My original biopsy in 2015 and one they did this past May was sent to Foundation One. Only one gene identified, but the ONC in Dallas took a blood sample and is sending off to Guardant360 (anyone hear of them?) to see if maybe I have anything that shows up in my blood that matches their gene types they have for clinical trials. All pretty exciting. I will stay on Doxil until my next scan, if no progression will stay with Doxil then move to clinical trial when we see progression. Chirps...I too have lost weight in past 2 months (18 pounds). But it is mainly because I stopped the steroid pre-meds. I was only doing half dose...but was gaining and swelling. So when I did GEM/Carbo and needed no steroids I began to loose weight, then Eribulin also no steroids. So I asked that I be able to stay off them with this chemo. I don't experience nausea, and since that is what the steroids are primarily for, we have stopped for now. Nan...I do not have the BRCA gene...so can't do that PARP inhibitor.

My hair never really came back as thick as it was before the first round of cancer, so when it started to fall out and get thinner than it was I decided to just shave it. I do have to shave what little stubble I get every week. I did loose all my lashes and eye brows (had new brows tatooed on, and love them) I wear false eyelashes and really no one can tell the difference. I didn't really loose my lashes with my original diagnosis and I used Latise to help them come back when I was done with that set of Chemo. But when they fell out this time around, it was an emotional time for me. I think I was more upset about the lashes than I was the hair. So is your Doctor putting you on Taxol?",

He didn't think there was a big hurry to start it. At the time I was considering changing ONC and did change to one that my daughter knows from the hospital where she works. She was with me on starting chemo as soon as possible. She also chose to start me on Taxol which was different than the previous ONC had planned.

My last PET scan in May was stable....so we will do a scan again mid July and if I show progression then we will move to a third line (next option chemo). What chemo are you on now? I haven't really changed my diet...I had always eaten pretty healthy and exercised. When I was originally diagnosed in 2013 that was such a surprise because I didn't even have a primary care doctor...never had been sick except to have my children. Had been a personal trainer and always ate halthy. Really the only thing I changed is eating a few more vegetables and cut back on the social wine/margaritas. I only have a glass of wine or a margarita for special occasions. I don't juice or anything like that....I feel quality of life is important and to me enjoying a good meal is part of that quality of life. A little suggestion.....you might add your treatments that you have undergone so far to your profile....it makes it a little easier to understand what you have been on etc....just a little suggestion.

I have worked for 3 different companies at the same location (Nuclear Power Plant) for 31 years. My husband retires this Thursday and it was going to be so hard to get up at 4:30 a.m. to go to work with him still in bed. So I made the decision to retire with him and to \"Live Life\" while my body is still in good shape! I was diagnosed 14 months ago as Stage IV with mets to lungs and sternum. I still feel as good as I did on that day and figured I needed to do the things I want while I physically can, hoping and planning on that being many more years with Gods help. I currently work 4/10's a week and drive 1 hour each way to work. After diagnosis I continued to work because it was my normal. We are financially stable and do not need my income to do the things we want. So on July 28th (I gave them 5 weeks notice). I thought I would be scared....but I am soooo excited!! Julie",

I have had two cycles of the Gem/Carbo but due to blood counts (white the first cycle and platelets the second) I could not do the Carbo on week two. The cycle is Gem/Carbo week one, Carbo week two and then week off. I see my ONC on the 9th so will see if we reduce dose again or what the plan is. Only SE has been a little more fatigue than usual. Hoping 2017 is a year of good news for all..... Still living life and enjoying our retirement. So glad I made the decision to retire early and enjoy time with my DH. We have two trips planned for the year so far. Vegas in February to celebrate with my daughter and her husband. My daughter received her Masters degree in December for Nursing Administration. Our son and his girlfriend will join us. Then in March we are off to Greece for an Ocean Cruise. I pray for you all daily. I am a positive outlook person, I know that my life will be cut short due to this horrible disease, but I am one to not dwell on that and to live what life I have to the fullest.

You mentioned problems with your white count. I had that problem after I had WBR for my brain mets and prior to trial. In fact they wouldn't let me do the trial unless I got my count up. I read to drink lots of water (at least 64 oz) of room temperature water. And my daughter (Masters in Nursing) told me not to drink alot before the labs are done....try to have labs in morning if possible. Drinking alot of liquids has a tendency of diluting the blood which will contribute to the low count. I was lucky when I decided to check on Clinical Trials my Oncologist got the ball rolling....she set up the appointment and everything. Hugs to all you ladies. Julie",

Not holding my breath, in fact I have an appt. with my ONC i had for 2 years to find out what is next. Kaayborg, I am so sorry nothing seems to be working. Talk to your ONC about CMF it kept me stable for a year. Kaylynne good luck with your trial. You will love the tram. Are you going to Mary Crowley in Dallas or Texas Oncology? I went to Mary Crowley for my trial. Welcome to the group Riley. If you only have one tumor....why not have surgery to remove it? Just wondering. Hugs to all you ladies!!! ",

Even if they removed the largest one at that time 1.3 cm there were too many (5) others that were less than .5mm in other places (lung, lymph nodes and sternum) to perform surgery on. I guess if by chance those small tumors were to go away and all I had was the larger one (now half its size with treatment) they would do surgery on it. There is a lady I have chatted with while getting chemo who is a now on a maintenance drug for mets...she is HER2+ and she had tumors in her chest wall and a larger one on her liver. Once the tumors were gone from the chest they did surgery on the liver to remove that tumor....so I guess it is possible but depends on the circumstances......she uses the same ONC as I do. Wow 51 lbs...wish I could loose a few. I gained 12 with my initial diagnosis in 2013 but have managed to maintain my weight with this round. The steroids don't help me and my appetite! Julie",

Stave IV has a tendency of making us more in tune with our body and watching every ache, pain and change that may be just age or normal body changes. Weight gain is typical especially if they have you on steroids. I always had a flat belly until chemo came along. I remember complaining to my ONC about the weight gain....and he answered \"Oh that would be my fault because of the steroids\". How often do you do your chemo? Keep us posted on your results!

Bad days and Pitty Parties are part of the journey, we all have those. But you will have good days too! You will learn to live life to it's fullest each day! You will look at everything differently, in a good way! You will appreciate things more than you did before! My mets are in my lungs, 1 on my sternum and 2 nodes. I was on Taxol for 8 months but progression showed it ugly face and I have now switched to CMF. Doing good with it! You will need to rely/trust your Oncologist more with a Stage IV diagnosis than you did with your initial diagnosis. There is pretty much a standard care for stage I, II and III breast cancer....Stage IV is different. Ladies...make sure and update your profiles with your diagnosis and treatments. It helps when we talk to each other to see what you have had in the past. Again Welcome! Just wish we were all here for a different reason.",

It is suppose to be good with Triple Negative BC. The Fluorouracil is basically the same as Xeloda. I have had 5 treatments (1 every 3 weeks). The only SE so far has been this past week when my WBC was very low...which is a very first for me, it has been just below normal before but not this low in all the time I have taken Chemo. My ONC let me go ahead and do my treatment last Friday she backed off of the Methotrexate a little....but other than that nothing. I still felt great! Yep...I do drink around 80 to 100 ounces of water a day, if not more. I drive 1 hour each way to work and I drink a 20 oz. bottle of water each way (and yes I have to use the bathroom as soon as I arrive at my destination ). Then at work I usually drink another 30 - 40 oz and another 20 oz bottle at home. I honestly think this helps me with my chemo and why I don't experience the SE's that so many do. I have (knock on wood) never had the typical SE's except hair loss. Julie",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2016 12:05PM Texasrose53 wrote: Hey Donna. I also have a port. In fact it is my second port. The first was removed 1 year after my initial diagnosis in 2013. Then when my cancer had metastasized to my lungs I had a new port put in. It is so much easier. I have labs drawn from my arm (I can only have it done from my right arm due to lymphedema). The lab techs sometimes have a hard time getting my vein to pop. But when I get my chemo infusion every 3 weeks (and it takes 2 hours), it only takes a minute for them to access my port. They usually spray some freezing spray on it before they access it. The needle in my port is attached to a tube that goes to the chemo that is hanging from on an IV cart (not sure what it is called). But anyway....I can unplug it from the electric monitor and wheel that cart around the room and take restroom breaks if needed. Then when I return to my chair I just plug it back in and all set. I am unplugging the electrical cord not the IV it self. I highly recommend a port...especially for anyone that is Triple Negative since we will be on some type of chemo for the rest of our lives. I don't worry if it shows..like you Kaay mine is easy to see and access. Below is a picture of me receiving my chemo infusion. Hope this helps with your questions. ",

I met with the other Oncologist at Mary-Crowley Research Institute today about clinical trials. She has two that I fit into...I won't be doing the LIV-1 instead we have chosen for me to do first is a vaccine created just for my tumor. I will have surgery next Friday to have the 3 cm tumor removed from the lower right area of my lung. That tumor will then be sent to the trial company for a vaccine to be created just for my tumor. That will take about 3 weeks. There are two trial drugs being used that might slow cell growth. One is the vaccine the other is an infusion. The study involves gene transfer. I am very excited and hope it works. Please pray that we have some success. Prayers and hugs for all you lovely ladies!! Juli",

My last chemo treatment was June 12th. Was suppose to start trial 4 weeks later (they wanted me to have a cleanse period before the trial). Week before I was to start the trial I had developed brain mets. So not eligible for the trial at that time...I did WBR for 14 sessions. Research people told me I could start trial after a four week cleanse from radiation. I elected to do that. They had labs drawn, did MRI and CT scans. MRI showed decrease in size and some of the brain mets gone. CT scan showed that I had mets in right side of liver. Well..I am very excited about this trial even though waiting caused me to have new mets, The nurse that administered my vaccine and infusion told me they have had great results with this trial. One woman is cancer free following 10 treatments.Another is 8 months stable....this is an immunotherapy trial with a vaccine that was created in a lab to fight my cancer. I will keep you all posted on how it is going. I did experience some major fatigue from the WBR but am feeling great!! Huggs to each one of you!! Julie",

Both are grown, my daughter is married and has 2 beautiful children, she is about to finish her Masters Degree in Nursing (I have letter for that day...if I am not around). My son is not married his priority right now is to buy a home...I have written a letter for that day and a letter for when he marries. I have started a letter for my DH...he is my strength. I have also started a life story...things that my children would find interesting about my life. I have also advised my DH to do the same... I wish I had something similar from my father when he passed. His very best friend wrote me a lengthy letter with so many stories and interesting items about my dad. I treasure that letter. There are times I mention my wishes to my DH...like I want to be buried not cremated. We don't spend a lot of time on those discussions but it gives him bits and pieces about what I want done. We both have faced reality that I have cancer and that is what will probably take me from this earth. But we are continuing to live life!! I also have 3 very Best Friends that I share my wishes with. I know they will help my DH and my children when the day comes. Thank you again for starting this....there are things that have been posted that I hadn't even started to think about!
