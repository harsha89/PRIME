Well, after 3 weeks of improving numbers we had a setback and the doctor is starting her on Taxol at a lower dose next Thursday. I'm wondering if anyone here has had positive results with Taxol with a compromised liver? I'm kind of back to panic mode. Thanks and happy Thanksgiving.",

My Mom is recently diagnosed (August) with bone and liver mets. She was Stage IIB ER+ PR+ Her2- from 2013 (no lymph node involvement just a bigger tumor) so its been kind of a shock for us and we're still reeling. She's been started on Femara and Ibrance for about a week but her liver enzymes are still elevated and she's pretty wiped out. Some of her liver enzymes improved but the one causing her to be slightly jaundiced went up (where previously it was normal level) so it feels like we're treading water right now. I'm thinking we all want her to improve quickly, so there's kind of a impatience, but reading about many people here who when diagnosed with liver mets went on chemo to \"put the fire out\" has made me uneasy about the current state of treatment considering her present state. I'm not sure whether I should feel ok that we're just on the first line treatments and I just want her to start feeling better now, or if the onc is making a bad call. I have to tell myself that if things were really out of hand the onc would move quick, but I can't shake that nagging feeling. Thanks for listening. -PDX",

I've seen a couple posts about elevated bilirubin and it's got me really, really nervous right now. Has anyone dealt with elevated bilirubin levels and seen improvement when treatment started working? Thanks-PDX",

The liver is definitely the main concern as it seems to just be getting worse. She went from being ok in September to having a swollen liver and jaundice in about a month while on ibrance and femara. It's just been a nightmare because things seem to just keep going in the wrong direction",

From what I understood her onc wanted her on taxol in order to get ahead of things before it got too out of hand and chemo is no longer a option. I think part of the decision came because of what the MO saw on her scan. No the sure if it was progression but given the turn in her condition last week I imagine it may have been",
