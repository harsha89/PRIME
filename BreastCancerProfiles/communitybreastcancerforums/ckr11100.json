I think 2 weeks was about the turn around for me with feeling like I needed to take the pain meds or not.  Everything just seemed to get better day by day after that. I hope things go the same for you.  It does get better, it really does.",

My DCIS was very small.  3 little grains of salt.  I work in an imaging center and pull down mammos after the radiologists read them, put the paperwork with the film jackets etc.  So I see this every day.  It would never happen to me of course.  The center I work at just got their first digital mammogram machine.  I was due (actually overdue, my first mammo was 2 years ago in January) so I offered to get mine done as soon as the new machine went in.    The radiologist that read my mammo took me back in the room and let me look at the films.  It was very tiny.  he told me that I could wait and recheck it in 6 months or if I was going to worry to schedule a biopsy.  I opted for the biopsy.  One week later, I had the biopsy.  It came back DCIS and LCIS.  I thought long and hard.  I for one did not want to have radiation.  I also have children and one small child, a little girl who is 6.  I wanted to be sure that I was around for a long time.  My DCIS was on the left side and I was afraid of having radiation to that part of my body when my heart is on that side.  It was just my personal decision to have bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction on May 8.  I am 6 days out now and really doing better than expected. It is a very personal choice.  I read everything I could get my hands on.  This website has been a godsend.  All of my co-workers and radiologists I work with as well as my husband were very supportive of my decision.  I did the research as well and was told that the mastectomy was as \"curable\" as lumpectomy and radiation.  I was just not comfortable with that.  I hope you find peace in a decision that is the right one for you.  I did and feel completely happy with the choice I made.    My path report after surgery did come back that my DCIS was high grade and the \"healthy\" breast had some funky tissue that I believe may have been most likely precancerous.  That solidified my views as well.",
