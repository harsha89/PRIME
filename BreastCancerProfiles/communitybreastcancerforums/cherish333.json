After that I will have Taxol CHEMO for 12 weeks and radiation for 6 weeks. I was suppose to have 8 cycles but my schedule changed due to me not being able to take the Nuelasta shot to bring up my white blood cells because I have the sickle cell trait.. I just got home and I feel regular. No pain, or nausea. Just going to relax.",
