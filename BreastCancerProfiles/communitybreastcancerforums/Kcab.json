She clearly felt the lump at 6 o'clock and sent me for a mammogram and an ultrasound. Mammogram showed dense breast tissue but not the lump and ultrasound showed the lump but they said \"it's likely a ridge\" exact words from the tech. Radiologist sent report back to my dr negative around 12 pm. By 1pm my Ob gyn messaged me that she wasn't satisfied and is sending me to a breast surgeon tomorrow (Monday) mind you this all happened on Wednesday. What questions should I ask? Should I push any extra testing? I would hate to come to this visit and not ask the right questions only to find later on that I perhaps should have pushed an issue more. Thoughts? Thank you so much!! Log in to post a reply",
