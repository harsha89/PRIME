MRIs are very nonspecific and so often lead to more biopsies. It depends on your risk tolerance. Six months would confirm stability, or you could have an MRI guided biopsy if an MRI still looks suspicious, in which case you would probably have to have two MRIs",

Just because the atypical cells got upgraded doesn't mean they were separate. For example, my stereotactic biopsy was ALH, suspicious for LCIS. My MRI did not show any extra area of concern. When my ALH mass was removed by excisional biopsy and they looked at a bigger chunk than was removed by core it was, in fact upgraded to LCIS.",

      "Content": "Aug 20, 2017 09:11AM - edited Aug 20, 2017 09:13AM by MelissaDallas I'm copying your prior post, so members can tespond to you in context: So I'm probably starting this the way most do... I'm really worried. For several months or had a small pea sized, what I believe is movable, lump in my breast. This isn't my first rodeo with lumps. I am breastfeeding and have been breastfeeding or pregnant for years with my 4 children so I don't get regular mamograms. My breast doctor told me it's too hard to see anything while breastfeeding and can't while pregnant, so I put it off. I've had a lump removed before that was m&m shaped, movable, about 3 years ago, that turned out to be a clogged milk duct, with my last child, and I had a lactational adonoma about a year or so before that that was biopsies and found benign..... So when i found this lump, I really chalked it up to my expertise and experience.... Its nothing! I also moved from Az to Ca and didn't have a well established Dr, so no one to run to as I would in AZ where I had a breast Dr and awesome OBGYN. My friend referred me to this new OB for mid period bleeding. That was in May. I mentioned it to my Ob/gyn, who I'm seeing for the mentioned other female issues(ovarian cysts that we are \"monitoring\" for change) , but couldn't find the lump on my breast that day. I'm not sure I pointed it out, I just let him do a breast exam and he felt nothing so I quickly dismissed it. He gave me a slip for a Mano anyway since it had been years but I explained I couldn't yet go because I was breast feeding. Then at my annual exam this early July, he did another check and didn't feel anything, and I didn't point anything out. I mentioned my cystic breasts and he handed me another Mano slip... to which I said... can't yet, breastfeeding but that maybe i should get an ultrasound. He wanted me back in 2 weeks for my ovarian u/s first and said we could do a breast U/s too, but never wrote it up. Just my abdominal u/s I really wrote it off. The other day i was at my Ob following up on my other issues and just remembered at the end of my appt to ask about my lump. Imentioned the lump which I recently \"refound,\" which, now, I could feel. I don't know that it's bigger, just that It's maybe more prominent. It's hard, round edges and moves a bit, not a ton but a bit... and so when he felt it, he grew very concerned.... put my other issues (which I was very worried about) on the back burner and very stern, asked me how long it's been there. I wasn't sure. I thought it had gone away and being more concerned with my other issues, just mentioned a couple of weeks maybe. (But now thinking back, as I mentioned, it's really been months... I thought it had gone away.) I said, \"but it's round and movable\" and he said \"that means nothing!\" He wrote me a slip for a 3D Mamo and u/s. This time he noted the mass and drew the spot, cited as a 1cm mass. It's not 1 cm though... it's pea sized, small pea at that. I took it and still more concerned about my abdominal U/s and the changes on it, he assured me the breast lump was much more concerning at the moment. So now, I'm confused. Do I need to worry about Ovarian C or breast.... Still wrote off the breast. I called him later in the day to discuss my ovaries and his findings again since the findings made me panic and I hadn't listened to him much in the office appt, and what he thought about that u/s... you see, in his office, I just panicked that my ovaries were now cystic on both sides, not just the one, and I freaked out rna for the cliff and diagnosed myself with ovarian or uterine C when he hadn't ....but once I pointed out the breastlump he was VERY adamate about concern for my breast over my ovaries. ( which I'm again going back to U/s in 2 weeks to monitor.. feel like Im falling apart.) He again firmly demanded to know how long it's been there and I stated a couple of weeks?? This was this past Friday. My appointment for my breast is next (next week) Monday. Since, I'm now shifting and focused on my breast and realizing I asked my husband to feel the lump ages ago. Maybe a few montrhs ago, maybe longer... maybe much longer. I think I had thought it disappeared and it was par for the course with all my prior lumps and bumps... only to find it again the other day.... ?? I don't know. I wasn't even going to mention it to him but it wasn't going away. Aside from that, I have a cough with back and headaches,stabbing shoulder pains and twitching on my left side of my upper back, as well as collar bone pain..... left side, same as lump.... and now I'm wondering. Have I been too dismissive and did I not take something so serious, not seriously. I'm a mother of 4. I'd been through lumps and bumps and felt itgis time was the same. Now I sit hoping and praying 🙏🏼 I didn't shoot myself In the foot. Im so frightened. Please someone give me peace of mind. Thank you for reading",

AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2010 Jun;194(6):1674-9. doi: 10.2214/AJR.09.3568. Shimauchi A, Jansen SA, Abe H, Jaskowiak N, Schmidt RA, Newstead GM. Department of Radiology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. ashimauc@radiology.bsd.uchicago.edu The objective of our study was to determine the sensitivity of cancer detection at breast MRI using current imaging techniques and to evaluate the characteristics of lesions with false-negative examinations. Two hundred seventeen patients with 222 newly diagnosed breast cancers or highly suspicious breast lesions that were subsequently shown to be malignant underwent breast MRI examinations for staging. Two breast imaging radiologists performed a consensus review of the breast MRI examinations. The absence of perceptible contrast enhancement at the expected site was considered to be a false-negative MRI. Histology of all lesions was reviewed by an experienced breast pathologist. Enhancement was observed in 213 (95.9%) of the 222 cancer lesions. Of the nine lesions without visible enhancement, two lesions were excluded because the entire tumor had been excised at percutaneous biopsy performed before the MRI examination and no residual tumor was noted on the final histology. The overall sensitivity of MRI for the known cancers was 96.8% (213/220); for invasive cancer, 98.3% (176/179); and for ductal carcinoma in situ, 90.2% (37/41). In a population of 220 sequentially diagnosed breast cancer lesions, we found seven (3.2%) MRI-occult cancers, fewer than seen in other published studies. Small tumor size and diffuse parenchymal enhancement were the principal reasons for these false-negative results. Although the overall sensitivity of cancer detection was high (96.8%), it should be emphasized that a negative MRI should not influence the management of a lesion that appears to be of concern on physical examination or on other imaging techniques.

The milk duct can then become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis). Your chance of developing mammary duct ectasia \u2014 with or without inflammation \u2014 increases with age. Mammary duct ectasia usually improves without treatment. However, if symptoms persist despite self-care measures, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct.

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2017 04:11AM - edited Aug 28, 2017 04:11AM by MelissaDallas Kittie's other post is pertinent to her question: Hello everyone. I am just looking for some input on an issue I have been having. I am trying make a doctor's appointment but he is closed today so I can't get through until tomorrow and I am driving myself crazy :S A little background is that I am 32 and a mother of 1. I do not have a history of breast cancer in my family but I did loose my mother to lung cancer about 7 years ago. So here it is.....about 3 months ago I developed an infection in my right nipple. Back in my younger, more crazy, years I had my nipples pierced. I took them out about 6 years ago but they never completely closed over. So because of my former piercings, I chalked my infection up to bacteria getting into the old holes. My doctor gave me antibiotics and it cleared up after about a week. Fast forward to today. I have noticed the look of my nipple steadily changing. When I had the infection there was a lump under my nipple which remains there today. The pain has long since disappeared but over the last few days it has gotten itchy and red all over my breast. My nipple, this is what concerns me the most, has not stuck out since the infection. It is almost flat and has a small indent right in the middle. I have always has flaky nipple skin which I just assumed was normal but now I am second guessing it. Stupid me started googling and of course the worse comes up and now I am concerned it might be Paget's disease. I am trying to convince myself that I am over reacting and that maybe everything just didn't heal right after the infection but I am stressing out. Has anyone else had similar issues with their nipple? Those who have been diagnosed with Paget's, what were your earliest symptoms?",

Here's some info: The CHEK2 1100delC mutation identifies families with clustering of both colorectal and breast cancer, referred to as the hereditary breast and colorectal cancer phenotype(HBCC)[5]. The mutation, however, appears not to be the major contributor to the HBCC phenotype, thus limitimg its use in genetic counseling. Possibly, CHEK2 1100delC acts as a risk modifier in families with Lynch syndrome[18]. In a Swedish study, CHEK2 1100delC was not a major cause of double primary breast and colorectal cancer[6]. In Polish studies, positive associations with protein-truncating CHEK2 alleles were seen for cancers of the thyroid (OR 4.9), breast (OR 2.2), and prostate (OR 2.2). The missense variant I157T was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.4), colon cancer (OR 2.0), kidney cancer (OR 2.1), prostate cancer (OR 1.7), thyroid cancer (OR 1.9) and ovarian cystadenomas, borderline ovarian cancers and low-grade invasive ovarian cancers, but not no high grade ovarian cancer[12,15,17]. All mutation types combined were associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (OR 1.9)[13]. In a Finnish population, the I157T mutation was observed more frequently in colorectal cancer patients than in controls. A trend towards higher frequency was seen in patients with multiple primary tumors and/or a family history of cancer[14]. A Danish-German study suggested a two-fold increase in melanoma risk for 1100delC carriers[23]. ",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2013 03:02PM MelissaDallas wrote: Linae, this is from a recent thread: \"First, the \"probably benign\" wording that your radiologist used is actually the correct wording to define an image that has been rated as a BIRADs 3. As laypeople, the word \"probably\" doesn't give us the warm fuzzies but to a radiologist, it's means something quite different. A BIRADs 3 rating is only given to images that the radiologist judges to have less than a 2% chance of being cancer. Anything more than 2% and the radiologist will rate the image as a BIRADs 4 and recommend a biopsy. I recently read a study that indicated that in fact radiologists tend to be conservative about using the BIRADs 3 rating - they err on the side of caution and rate many images as BIRADs 4 when they could be BIRADs 3 - and the actual malignancy rate of BIRADs 3 images is 0.7%. BI-RADS 3 Probably Benign Finding - Initial Short-Interval Follow-Up Suggested: A finding placed in this category should have less than a 2% risk of malignancy. It is not expected to change over the follow-up interval, but the radiologist would prefer to establish its stability... www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p... For something with such a low risk of being cancer, a 6 month follow-up is usually what's recommended because that is considered to be the most prudent approach. Radiologists try to avoid putting patients through unnecessary biospies. If the area of concern shows stability over 6 months, then the risk that it might be cancer drops well below the original 2%. If over the 6 months there is a change such as a reduction in the size of the mass, that would be good news indicating that the area of concern is not cancer. But if there is a change that indicates concern, then a biopsy will be done at that 6 month point. Breast cancer is usually very slow growing - it takes years for most cancers to grow to the point of even being visible on imaging - so the 6 month delay is extremely unlikely to impact a diagnosis. The other issue for radiologists is the simple fact that there is a lot of stuff that goes on in our breasts. 60% of women have fibrocystic breasts, which means that we have cysts or have other benign conditions that might show up on a mammogram or ultrasound. Radiologists are trained to distinguish between the appearance of these benign conditions and the appearance of cancer, but of course nothing can be 100% certain. That's the other reason for the word \"probably\". But if radiologists sent every woman with any fibrocystic condition in for an immediate biopsy, there would be thousands more biopsies done every day. And then when someone with a more serious concern needed to have a biopsy, the wait to get the biopsy would be longer.\" Another thing, when you start doing unnecessary biopsies you get scar tissue in your breasts that can obscure bad things you want seen.",

When they offer you a six month follow up they estimate there is a less than 3% chance it might be cancerous. I'd just do the follow up & see if they stay stable.",

Pain meds usually only last about four hours. What was weird is that I had more discomfort a good distance away from the incision than I did right where the surgery was.

They recommend biopsy for anything they think could have even a 3% chance of being cancer. \"Concerning\" , \"suspicious\" and even \"very suspicious\" are commonly used and very subjective. Even \"suspicious\" edges often turn out to be nothing more than benign fibroadenomas that don't have a \"classic\" appearance.

Stir to dissolve and let stand until foamy, about 8 minutes. Add oil and salt to yeast mixture. Gradually stir in 3-1/3 cups white flour and 2 cups rye flour. Knead dough on floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more white flour if sticky, about 10 minutes. Place dough in larged oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Dust 2 large baking sheets with all purpose flour. Punch down dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Press out to a 1\" thick rectangle. Sprinkle on the figs and roll up jelly roll style. Knead to distribute figs evenly. Divide dough in half and roll each piece into a 16-inch long loaf. Transfer to prepared sheets. Cover with towel. Let rise in warm area until doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 400*F. Bake loaves until golden and bottoms sound hollow when tapped, using spray bottle to spray oven with water every 10 minutes, about 45 minutes. Cool completely on racks. This bread freezes well. NOTE: Here is Julia Child's foolproof food processor bread dough method: Prepare yeast mixture in a measuring cup. Put all dry ingredients in processor [I use 3 cups white and 2 rye flour], using the plastic dough blade if you have it. Turn on machine and pour in the liquid, then the oil. Let run until dough forms a rapidly rotating ball, adding a little more water if dough doesn't come together (or a little more flour if too sticky to form a ball). Stop the machine and let dough rest 5 minutes. (Important!) Turn on the machine again and let dough ball rotate 30 times. Stop the machine, turn dough out outo a floured board and let rest 2 more minutes. Knead 50 strokes by hand. I also use Julia's trick of heating the oven with a cast iron skillet on the bottom, then throwing 1/2 cup water into the skillet to create the steam. ",

Could be fibrocystic stuff or benign papilloma or phyllodes or othere things. 80% of masses on biopsy are benign. That is not to say that depending on what the biopsy shows that it may still need to come out. I think that if they were relatively certain it was definitely cancer they would have told you. As far as genetics, it would be a lot more concerning if your mom or sisters had breast cancer, especially if your granny didn't have it until she was older. Most breast cancer is not genetic. As far as waiting, it is the worst part of the whole process, but a few weeks doesn't make much difference in the grand scheme of things as far as if it is cancer because most are slow and have been growing for years before it shows up. Hang in there until you get your results, and don't get ahead of yourself, because this may not be so serious as you think. Hugs, Melissa",

Your fibrocystic stuff is multifocal be cause it is not just a single cyst or fibroid. My LCIS is multifocal because it is usually all over the place plus I also had a cyst. Many women with DCIS or other cancer have it in more than one spot, thus \"multifocal\" Chances are whatever they are checking on you will be more of the same benign stuff you already know about. Try not to get too anxious about it. Chances are it is fine.",

Thank you for the diagram and words. And the color of discharge was like white but it was more like pimple kind of thing ? It came when I squeezed it. I went to see a ob gyn specialist this morning and he examed my breast. He said he was not concerned about the gland (discharge) and if it keeps coming back he would order an ultrasound. However he said he was worried about a black dot on that same nipple, so he would order me a biopsy in 2 weeks to cut and send it to the pathologist... When i asked him if he found any lump, All he said was your breast is dense. ? What is that mean? Confused....But he didn't seem alert about the discharge....just the dark color pigment on my nipple.

Unlike mammography, in which an X-ray of the breast is taken, thermography produces an infrared image that shows the patterns of heat and blood flow on or near the surface of the body. Some health care providers claim thermography is superior to mammography as a screening method for breast cancer because it does not require radiation exposure or breast compression. However, the FDA is unaware of any valid scientific evidence showing that thermography, when used alone, is effective in screening for breast cancer. To date, the FDA has not approved a thermography device (also referred to as a telethermographic device) for use as a stand-alone to screen or diagnose breast cancer. The FDA has cleared thermography devices for use only as an additional diagnostic tool for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Therefore, FDA says, thermography devices should not be used as a stand-alone method for breast cancer screening or diagnosis. \u201cMammography is still the most effective screening method for detecting breast cancer in its early, most treatable stages,\u201d said Helen Barr, M.D., director of the Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs in the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cWomen should not rely solely on thermography for the screening or diagnosis of breast cancer.\u201d The FDA has issued warning letters to some health care providers who have been promoting the inappropriate use of breast thermography. The letters instructed the providers to cease making claims that thermography devices, when used alone, are an effective means of detecting breast cancer. Claims have, for instance, appeared on some providers\u2019 websites. The FDA encourages women to: \u2022 Have regular mammograms according to screening guidelines or as recommended by their health care provider; \u2022 Follow their health care provider\u2019s recommendations for additional breast diagnostic procedures, such as various mammographic views, clinical breast exam, breast ultrasound, MRI or biopsy; additional procedures could include thermography; \u2022 Remember that thermography is not a substitute for mammography and should not be used by itself for breast cancer screening or diagnosis. \u201cWhile there is plenty of evidence that mammography is effective in breast cancer detection, there is simply no evidence that thermography can take its place,\u201d said Barr.

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2014 06:29PM MelissaDallas wrote: A mammogram is a specialized X-ray of the breast. It can be used to evaluate a breast lump or other abnormality that has been detected by a breast self-exam (BSE) or a clinical breast examination. Mammography is also important as a screening tool because it can detect breast cancer at an early stage, before it can be felt on a physical exam. Mammogram interpretation is performed by a radiologist. When a radiologist interprets a mammogram, he or she assigns a score to it that indicates the radiologist's opinion as to the likelihood of cancer being present. The score is used to communicate with doctors about how concerned the radiologist is about the findings. The American College of Radiologists has developed national standards for rating mammograms. Your mammogram report may include a BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) assessment. There are seven categories. If you achieve a score of 3, 4 or 5, you will require a follow-up study. Knowing your BIRADS score will help ensure that you get the proper follow-up after your mammogram. It is part of what you need to know to actively participate in your medical care. BIRADS 0 \u2013 Diagnosis: Incomplete, typically because more information is needed. Next steps: The mammogram or ultrasound didn't give the radiologist enough information to make a clear diagnosis; follow-up imaging is necessary. BIRADS 1 \u2013 Diagnosis: Negative (N). Next steps: There is nothing to comment on. Breasts are normal and routine screening is recommended. BIRADS 2 \u2013 Diagnosis: Benign Finding-Negative (N). Next steps: A definite negative mammogram; radiologist may describe benign finding, such as a lymph node within the breast, breast implants or a fibroadenoma (solid lump comprised of benign cells); routine screening recommended. BIRADS 3 \u2013 Diagnosis: Probably Benign Finding (P). Next steps: A finding is present that is most likely benign (>98%), but another evaluation should be made shortly. You'll be asked to follow-up with a repeat mammogram in six months. If you have a family or personal history of breast cancer, the radiologist may opt to do more tests now rather than wait. BIRADS 4 \u2013 Diagnosis: Suspicious Abnormality (S). Next steps: Lesions are present that don't have characteristics of breast cancer, but there is a reasonable probability of malignancy (20% to 35%); a biopsy should be considered. BIRADS 5 \u2013 Diagnosis: Highly Suspicious of Malignancy (M). Next steps: Lesion has a high probability of being cancer (>= 95%). Appropriate action should be taken. You will need to have a biopsy for diagnosis. Talk to your doctors about what course of action to take. BIRADS 6 \u2013 Diagnosis: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy. Next steps: Biopsy-detected malignancy is present but additional information is necessary.",

I had an unusual presentation of Mucinous Borderline Ovarian Tumor, intestinal cell type (huge-almost 20 pound tumor) with large volume ascites and PE and then was shortly thereafter diagnosed with LCIS. I had paternal grandmother & aunt with colon cancer and a dad who grows big polyps fast & you tested me for CHEK2 and PTEN before BRCA, all of which were negative. I have a network of high-risk friends through the breastcancer.org discussion boards who are on the six-month merry-go-round of monitoring for LCIS, ALH, ADH, etc. We saw this article http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/04/new-weapon-against-breast-cancer/?mc_cid=b0ef82a46d&amp;mc_eid=00533c3e53 We are wondering if it is feasible or possible to have our stored biopsy samples KI-67 tested for additional information. Also, in the case of ALH/LCIS, since it is so frequently multifocal, would the individual areas of concern be like diagnosed cancer and potentially all have different KI-67 rates? The constant monitoring is so emotionally wearing and we would all be so excited to have additional information that might help more accurately evaluate our true risk. Individual risk assessment in our cases seems to be so lacking at this point in time. Some \"high-riskers\" are told anywhere from 25% to 80%, which isn't very helpful. Hope you are doing well.

Both of the biopsies were truly benign. Fibrocystic breasts tend to hurt, and at 38 you may be entering the early stages of perimenopause which can kick up hormonal problems and make it worse. While his office has not handled you well and he may not have the greatest bedside manner, I think part of your problem has been confusion on what you were expecting. Since you didn't like him you should see another doctor next time, but I think you should be fine to follow up with your next regularly scheduled mammogram. While cancer can hurt, realistically it is way down the list of likely causes. Despite all the hassle, you do have good, as in benign, results.",

The whole subject is really you going through your testing to rule out cancer and what all happens to you. They are just being prudent, but I suppose they could have missed their target area because of the bleeding. About all that can be done about it now is to repeat the mammogram as they suggested in a month. I'm really sorry that happened to you. As far as \"would it make a difference?\". Probably not. Most cancers have been there for years before they are even big enough to be picked up by imaging, so a few weeks (or months) would make little, if any difference in the grand scheme of things. Lots of women who have already been diagnosed wait weeks and even a month or two while getting additional testing before surgery/treatment. I go through a very busy public hospital connected to an NCI Cancer Center. I had my screening mammogram the beginning of November, then didn't get my diagnostic mammogram until February, core biopsy in March and excisional biopsy in April-so going on six months through the process and they were not concerned about it at all.",

Having fibrocystic breasts is very common. Women with this noncancerous (benign) condition often experience lumpy, painful breasts. The cause of fibrocystic breast changes isn't completely understood. But the condition is likely associated with hormone fluctuations during a woman's menstrual cycle. Although it doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer, having fibrocystic breasts may interfere with your ability to detect new breast lumps or other abnormal changes that might need to be evaluated by your doctor. It's important to become familiar with how your breasts normally feel so that you'll know when something just doesn't feel right.\" Again, fibroadenomas do NOT change into or become cancer. Also, cervical cancer is not a breast cancer risk because it is almost always caused by the HPV virus.",

Your statistics on increased risk are also too broad. I have sclerosing adenosis & my oncologists have said that the increased risk from it is so minimal as to not worry about it. My lesion was removed & will not continue to grow abnormally. Radial scar does carry a significant risk of having other more severe conditions lurking within the area.

It is even more common on first mammograms, as they have nothing to compare to to see if whatever \"stuff\" they see is stable. You already know from the \"scattered fibroglandular tissue\" that you have fibrocystic breasts. With more views on a diagnostic mammogram (and/or ultrasound) they may very well say, \"yeah, definitely looks like a benign fibroadenoa-see you next year.\" Even if they aren't sure and have to biopsy whatever it is, better than 80% of those come back benign. Chances are you are just fine. Breast imaging just leaves a lot to be desired. ",

Either the NP thinks the biopsy missed the correct area, or as occasionally happens, they did get the right spot but the results are discordant with the imaging. Either way, I would want to discuss this with the doctor rather than the NP. Depending on what the situation is would determine which should be done. If the core biopsy didn't get the correct area it would make sense to just repeat it. If they feel like they did get the right place but the imaging doesn't correlate with a benign biopsy it might make more sense to have the surgical biopsy.",

Here is how it works: Ovarian secretion of estrogen and progesterone ends. Once the ovaries have stopped producing estrogens, however, they still continue to produce small amounts of the male hormone testosterone, which can be converted to estrogen (estradiol) in body fat. In addition, the adrenal gland continues to produce androstenedione (a male hormone), which is converted to estrone and estradiol in the body fat. The total estrogen produced after menopause, however, is far less than that produced during a woman's reproductive years. The best thing you can do to lower your estrogen post-menopausally is to lose any excess weight & have as little body fat as possible.",

I have since calmed down considerably. I've had my first follow up mammo & it was normal. There are a lot of high-risk women here who have been closely followed for years and are having no problems. There are also a lot of stories here about complications from mastectomies & reconstruction. I'm just going to take it one year at a time.

It is one of those \"aging breasts\" things. By Mayo Clinic Staff Mammary duct ectasia (ek-TAY-zhuh) occurs when a milk duct beneath your nipple becomes wider (dilated), the duct walls thicken and the duct fills with fluid. The milk duct can then become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis). Your chance of developing mammary duct ectasia \u2014 with or without inflammation \u2014 increases with age. Mammary duct ectasia usually improves without treatment. However, if symptoms persist despite self-care measures, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct. Though it's normal to worry about any changes in your breasts, mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastisis aren't risk factors for breast cancer.",

      "Content": "May 5, 2013 04:27AM MelissaDallas wrote: Perhaps this will help. It is from an earlier post by one of our resident experts, Beesie: smillsbc, Seeding from a needle biopsy is possible, but it's extremely rare. Obviously seeding is not an issue if the biopsy result is benign, which happens in 80% of cases. It's also not an issue if cancer is diagnosed and the patient decides to have a mastectomy. For those who have a lumpectomy, usually radiation is given and the purpose of radiation is to kill off any rogue cancer cells that might be left in the breast - and that of course would include any that happened to be there as a result of seeding. Here's what the medical expert on this website says about seeding: What My Patients Are Asking: Can Getting a Biopsy Spread the Cancer? For those who are concerned about seeding, what I don't understand is why they don't have the same concerns with a surgical biopsy. Seeding can happen if any cancer cells end up on a surgical instrument and then that surgical instrument is moved somewhere else and those cancers cells drop off. With a surgical biopsy, the margins of the mass are not always clearly defined, so it's very possible that even when a surgeon thinks that he or she is cutting around a tumor, he/she may in fact be cutting through the edge of the tumor. Additionally, any of us who've read our pathology reports after surgery realize that usually the area of concern is removed in several pieces, not in a single mass. Surgeons are trained to be very careful with their surgical instruments, so seeding is very rare, but sometimes it does take happen. Personally I think seeding is as likely, if not more likely, to result from surgery than from a needle biopsy. But the most important point is that this is rare. And when it happens, the treatments that are given for the cancer itself should address and eliminate any concerns. When there is an option between a needle biopsy and a surgical biopsy, a needle biopsy is usually recommended because it is the safer option. Surgery comes with risks. Anaesthesia. Infections. Healing problems. And after surgery, you are left with scar tissue in your breast. This can make future mammogram and ultrasound screenings more difficult, plus it can lead to the development of calcifications or fatty necrosis. If calcs or fatty necrosis show up on your mammogram, there will be no way to know that it's benign and just the result of the surgery - and then another biopsy will be necessary. I'm pretty sure that at least one of my biopsies, if not two of them, are a direct result of having had an earlier excisional (surgical) biopsy on that breast. Everyone needs to do what they feel most comfortable doing. I'm not posting this to change anyone's mind. I probably shouldn't be posting this at all. But I'm concerned. There has been a lot of misinformation going around in the \"Not Diagnosed\" forum recently, unnecessarily driving up fear levels. The bigger problem is that I see women actually making decisions based on this misinformation, rather than on the advice of their doctors. So I feel it's important to offer up some different information. More from the experts on this website: Biopsy \"Different techniques can be used to perform biopsy, and it\u2019s likely that your surgeon will try to use the least invasive procedure possible \u2014 the one that involves the smallest incision and the least amount of scarring... ...Medical guidelines say that about 90% of biopsies should be needle biopsies, the least invasive procedure. Still, research has shown that about 70% of breast biopsies are surgical biopsies. This means that many women who don't have cancer are having unnecessary surgery. It also means that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have to have a second operation to remove the cancer.\" .

You don't say whether your hyperplasia is ductal or lobular, but yes, sometimes your excisional biopsy will find \"other\" things. Not necessarily cancer though. My stereotactic biopsy showed atypical lobular hyperplasia, suspicious for lobular carcinoma in situ. The LCIS was confirmed on the excisional biopsy, but it is still not considered \"cancer\". It just ups my chances of eventually developing cancer, so I am just followed more closely than women with no findings on their mammograms. Sometimes they don't find anything else. I'm 51 and had never had an iffy mammogram either. Find out which type of hyperplasia you have. There are threads here on both ductal & lobular hyperplasia that may help answer some of your questions. Glad to have you here & to help. Melissa",

My thought is that since they are doing a fine needle as opposed to a core biopsy they are leaning towards it being a benign fibroadenoma or something. The vast majority of lumps are benign and the two month wait likely made no difference at all, because even if it were cancer most are very slow growing.",

Bouncing would make it more likely to develop a hematoma or seroma. I don't know if a couple of months of bouncing could cause any migration of the biopsy marker that will be placed. I think it just depends on how the core comes back. It may very well be completely benign, in which case it is moot. If it just comes back with some atypia the doctor could well let you wait several months for the excision if you ask and are comfortable with the wait. I go to a really busy county clinic staffed by a local university medical center. There are long waits between appointments. It took me from the first of November to the end of April to get through mammo, diagnostic mammo, core biopsy then excisional biopsy, so when it does not appear to be an urgent case the wait could conceivably be as long as what yours would be if you waited.",

Why would you want a mastectomy for that? I think the question really is why you are seemingly so overwhelmingly anxious about your breasts and why you seem determined to believe that there is something seriously wrong when it sounds like literally dozens of doctor visits and tests have told you there is not.  Anxiety is awful. I think most of us have had periods in our lives when we experienced it to one degree or another. I'm sorry you are experiencing this.",

Yes, they may find nothing further on her excisional biopsy, but she would still be followed with more frequent screenings and possibly offered either Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor to help lower her risk of developing cancer as these conditions are considered markers for being at higher risk of developing cancer. Once she has the excisional biopsy, if cancer is found she would still need further surgery - a lumpectomy or mastectomy depending on findings. Getting clear surgical margins for cancer are not the goal of a biopsy. I would prefer to be seen by a breast specialist, but some \"general surgeons\" ARE breast specialists. I have a friend who is such. She hasn't done anything except breast surgery in many years.",

This is from WebMD: In the last decade, several studies investigated the effects of Evista and tamoxifen in more than 37,000 women. For instance, one study that involved more than 19,000 women at high risk of developing breast cancer found that both medications had similar results in reducing invasive breast cancer. Unlike tamoxifen, however, Evista was not shown to reduce noninvasive forms of breast cancer. Noninvasive forms include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). It has been really pretty here. We have had virtually no Winter at all. I don't think it dropped below freezing at my house a handful of times all Winter. My sister's birthday is the 27th and mom always talks about how the wisteria and redbuds were blooming when she was born. I told her a couple of days ago that that wouldn't be the case this year because everything will have finished blooming long before that since everything came out extra early.  ",

Women's breasts aren't uniform. Most of us have one bigger than the other, which also probably means they have differing amounts of glandular vs fatty versus fibrocystic tissue. Rule of thumb is usually you start getting screened about ten years younger than your mom was when she was diagnosed. Gynecologists specialty is really below the belt, not above it.

Pain referred to the armpit is a classic symptom of hormonal or fibrocystic breasts, which is consistent with your ultrasound and second opinion. You ay you think both nipples might look a little different. While it does happen, it is pretty unlikely you would have cancer in both breasts. Just get your doctor to check you out.",

Core is better because it gives a more definitive result and if the fna didn't work then they would have had to do a core anyway. I had one last week. They went back and forth thinking it looked like either an atypical cyst or a benign lymph node, but it turned out to be a cyst. The vast majority of lumps are benign, and it sounds like they don't consider yours very worrisome, so here's hoping for benign results for you. When do you get your results?",

The wire placement is weird, but not as bad as it sounds. Kind of like a long fiddly seated mammogram, but mine didn't hurt. My hair kept getting in the way, so if you can pull yours back that helps if it is not short. The surgery itself is an easy day surgery. I was home by 1:00 or 2:00. Mom filled my pain prescription but I only took a couple, then Aleve for a day or so. You have minimal restrictions (mostly on lifting) for a day or two. I was really bruised but not terribly sore.",

Usually you lie on your stomach on a table with your breasts hanging through openings in the table. I have seen a couple of women who had them in a seated position. They will inject numbing. The first stick stings a little and then you will not feel anything but pressure. Lying still on the table was the most uncomfortable part for me.

I see lots of posts here where women are attributing purported potential side effects of aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen and the drugs are completely different and are not equivalent. Tamoxifen leaves circulating estrogen intact and prevents that estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors in your breasts. Aromatase inhibitors prevent postmenopausal (or women who undergo ovarian suppression) from converting androgens to estrogen. That is a very simplified explanation, but the drugs do indeed work completely differently and have different side effects.",

I feel like I got the same crap for 13 years when I started experiencing hormonal problems at around 37 and all the doctors would just give me that \"well, at your age\" speech.  I also feel like they blew me off because I was heavy.  We now know that this was probably when my ovarian tumor started developing.  It took putting on a massive amount of ascites, a pulmonary embolism, sky-high tumor markers, cardiac arryhtmia & almost dying for them to finally discover my 20 POUND ovarian tumor.  Even the first three days in the hospital I was getting the \"has anyone ever told you you have cirrhosis?\" speech.  I kept telling them that didn't make sense because I had no risk factors plus had normal labs and an essentially normal abdominal CT.  You wouldn't have thought I even had a body below my waist.  Only after undergoing an unnecessary liver biopsy did they finally do a pelvic CT on me.  Surprise, surprise.   ",

It is possible that you will have a biopsy at your appointment, but not likely. The surgeon will probably discuss what they think they are seeing and set up some appointments for MRI and biopsies for you. You can discuss the timing of these while you are there. You are correct that you are probably looking at a breast cancer diagnosis with the Birads 5 and the description. We have seen a few ladies with Birads 5 have negative biopsies, but as you know, that is not the most likely result.

Perhaps the SIL helped her with this so that her final expenses would be taken care of & that the policy would be paid & not lapse if she should become too ill to maintain it. If the policy was taken out after she became ill it would have to be a guaranteed issue policy which would be for a fairly minimal amount of coverage.",

Do you know know why they are going straight to an excisional biopsy? Usually a core needle biopsy is done first. The wire localization isn't bad. Kind of like a long seated mammogram. You'll feel a little sting when they start numbing you and that is about it. My hair is kind of an in-between length & we kept having to move it out of the way, so if you can pull yours back that makes things easier. You'll get lots of support here.

While breast cancer CAN hurt, it is way far down the list of reasons for breast pain. Breast pain is one of the most common reasons women go to the doctor.Almost all breast pain is hormonal and/or fibrocystic. Try to keep busy and find other things to occupy yourself until your appointment and to not worry too much. It is very unlikely you have anything serious going on. Stop Googling.

You want to do everything you can for her and it helps you to feel like you are doing something. Don't treat her like a child and try to make all the decisions for her. I am only 52, but when I had ovarian cancer the hardest part for me was I felt like I was having my autonomy taken away. I was sick, not incompetent. My mother, bless her heart, just about drove me insane and was really making me angry trying to do everything for me. She was a huge help, but I told my sister I was surprised she wasn't following me into the bathroom & jerking the TP out of my hand:) One day in the hospital they brought my meal tray and she kept doing things like grabbing things off my tray to open them for me when I was perfectly capable of doing it myself. I just wanted to start screaming and never stop. I finally had to tell her that I would ask her if I needed help.

Such changes were found in one or more glandular lobules in 3 per cent of the breast tissue specimens received in our departments. As a rule, this finding was made in women who had been pregnant and who had been or were on oestrogenic or on contraceptive medication. They occurred in fertile, menopausal, as well as in post-menopausal women. Often they were seen many years after the pregnancy and/or intake of hormones. They were observed also in women who had never been pregnant or on hormone medication, and even in men on oestrogen therapy. It is likely, therefore, that focal pregnancy-like changes in non-pregnant and non-lactating women indicate a selective susceptibility of the mammary glandular tissue to oestrogen. Accordingly, we interpret the change as a normal histological variant.",

When you have unnecessary biopsies you create scarring in your breast that can cause problems in reading future mammograms and actually lead to more biopsies. Here is how Birads works. With a six month f/u you were rated a 3 or 2. The American College of Radiology (ACR) has developed a standard way of describing mammogram findings. In this system, the results are sorted into categories numbered 0 through 6. This system is called the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Having a standard way of reporting mammogram results lets doctors use the same words and terms and ensures better follow up of suspicious findings. Here\u2019s a brief review of what the categories mean: This means a possible abnormality may not be clearly seen or defined and more tests are needed, such as the use of spot compression (applying compression to a smaller area when doing the mammogram), magnified views, special mammogram views, or ultrasound. This also suggests that the mammogram should be compared with older ones to see if there have been changes in the area over time. There\u2019s no significant abnormality to report. The breasts look the same (they are symmetrical) with no masses (lumps), distorted structures, or suspicious calcifications. In this case, negative means nothing bad was found. This is also a negative mammogram result (there\u2019s no sign of cancer), but the reporting doctor chooses to describe a finding known to be benign, such as benign calcifications, lymph nodes in the breast, or calcified fibroadenomas. This ensures that others who look at the mammogram will not misinterpret the benign finding as suspicious. This finding is recorded in the mammogram report to help when comparing to future mammograms. The findings in this category have a very good chance (greater than 98%) of being benign (not cancer). The findings are not expected to change over time. But since it\u2019s not proven benign, it\u2019s helpful to see if an area of concern does change over time. Follow-up with repeat imaging is usually done in 6 months and regularly thereafter until the finding is known to be stable (usually at least 2 years). This approach helps avoid unnecessary biopsies, but if the area does change over time, it allows for early diagnosis. Findings do not definitely look like cancer but could be cancer. The radiologist is concerned enough to recommend a biopsy. The findings in this category can have a wide range of suspicion levels. For this reason, some doctors may divide this category further: Not all doctors use these subcategories. The findings look like cancer and have a high chance (at least 95%) of being cancer. Biopsy is very strongly recommended. This category is only used for findings on a mammogram that have already been shown to be cancer by a previous biopsy. Mammograms may be used in this way to see how well the cancer is responding to treatment. Mammogram reports can also include an assessment of breast density. BI-RADS classifies breast density into 4 groups: This means that fibrous and glandular tissue makes up less than 25% of the breast Fibrous and glandular tissue makes up from 25 to 50% of the breast. The breast has more areas of fibrous and glandular tissue (from 51 to 75%) that are found throughout the breast. This can make it hard to see small masses (cysts or tumors). The breast is made up of more than 75% fibrous and glandular tissue. This can lead to missing some cancers. In some states, the summary of the mammogram report that is sent to patients (sometimes called the lay summary) must contain information about breast density. This information may be worded in lay language instead of the BIRADS categories. Women whose mammograms show BI-RADS 3 or 4 for breast density may be told that they have \u201cdense breasts.\u201d",

Depending on where women live, their insurance and the options for care in their community, often times the waits are weeks for these type appointments, and with the rare exception of inflammatory breast cancer it doesn't make a bit of difference.I routinely waited a month or six weeks. It took from the first of February until early May to get me through Mammo, diagnostic mammo, sterotactic and excisional biopsies. I did not have a choice. Women who have already been diagnosed routinely wait a couple of months going through testing before surgery.

If anyone is trying to understand the context of KayDee'ss post (like I was) here is her original post \"I recently noticed my right nipple itching and found a small bump right on the tip protruding from the duct. After searching the web, I figure it is probably just papilloma or some other benign growth but I couldn't find any images like what I have. Also, when I was \"examining\" it, a little bit of brownish yellowish, sticky discharge came out. I'm pretty sure I've had that before. Wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. I already have an appointment with my gyno but it isn't until November 15th and I originally booked that for the uterine fibroids that are making life miserable. I was supposed to have surgery over a year ago but I'm unemployed, uninsured and don't qualify for Medicaid. I guess I'm just concerned because the last thing I need is some problem with my breast, too. A little background: from my teens to early 20s I had 5 lumpectomies(thankfully all benign), more \"mutated moles\" removed than I can count, and now fibroids(submucosal the problematic one) & abnormally thick endometrium. I guess the point I'm trying to make is my body likes to grow things it's not supposed to but fortunately for me, none of it has been life threatening. Sometimes, however, I feel like my luck will run out. Kinda like the \"boy who cried wolf.\" And being uninsured makes me worry I won't catch it early. My friend's Mom got diagnosed with cancer in June and died 2 weeks later because it was too late and had spread through her body. Anyhoo, guess I'm rambling! End post.\"",

Yes, there are certain things like radial scar and sclerosing adenosis that can look like cancer on imaging but are benign. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy. That said, an experienced radiologist can probably pretty reliably know and recognize an obviously cancerous mass. You can hope that the biopsy surprises the radiologist, but I would be preparing myself for a diagnosis. Your doctor or the women's center may refer you. If I were diagnosed I would want treatment through an NCI designated cancer center if there was one near me.  Another thing, don't feel ignored if you don't get a lot of responses right away as it tends to be slow around here on weekends.

However, it is a benign condition and does not need treatment    Sclerosing adenosis may be found with atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) . Although some studies have shown sclerosing adenosis slightly increases the risk of breast cancer, recent findings suggest it does not increase risk.   Sommer, I don't think it is the same as radial scars.  ",

I'm not trying to rag on you, just calm your apprehension. Also, the fact that one was fibroid makes it highly likely that the other is too. Most women with fibrocystic condition have multiples.",

You really should get it checked because your doctor can give you some tips like avoiding caffeine, etc. that can possibly minimize your symptoms if that is what it is. If you take birth control pills that may aggravate it too. Part of being a grown up is learning to take care of yourself and getting regular check-ups. I'll bet, even if it takes a few tries you can find a gynecologist, possibly a woman, that you can learn to trust and like.
