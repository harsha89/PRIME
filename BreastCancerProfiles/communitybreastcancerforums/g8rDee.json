Trying to get all of the Christmas things done that I didn't think I was going to have to do when my surgery was scheduled in December have taken every ounce of energy I had. In addition to my cancer treatments I also have fibromyalgia, these two do not play well together at all. To answer the sleeping question... Nope I do not sleep straight through the night. I usually head to bed around 10 and rarely fall asleep before midnight. Then I am usually awake by 2 or so and up for an hour or two, but I usually spend that time off and on in the bathroom, my chemo has left my digestive system pretty torn up. Does not seem to matter what I eat. Today I am one week from my surgery, until December 23 I was not even sure how it was going to be covered, as my only insurance is doctor visits only. Luckily because I had to give up my full time job when this all started I got a letter saying my Medicaid had been approved. As difficult as it is for me to type that, it was my Christmas miracle. At least I know it is a temporary situation for me. My goal for the next week is to stay as busy as possible for the next week. Hopefully the pain will subside and things will go smoothly. I keep all of you in my thoughts and will be checking in more regularly now that the holidays are behind. Dee",

I am not sure I can go through this waiting again.  I have gotten lots of information from all of you and helpful hints that I am not sure I would have gotten anywhere else.   My power lift chair is being delivered on Tuesday and will be waiting for me on my return home. I will admit to being scared to death, nervous and everything else. Going to see my beloved Gators play on Monday (probably a bad idea, but it will be a great distraction) and then lay low on Tuesday.   Thanks again and wishing you all a Happy New Year... it has to be better than 2011 right??

I ended up staying in the hospital until Friday the 6th after surgery on Wednesday the 4th. They took 31 nodes!! One of the pesky things had a tumor so it looks like more chemo for me after my radiation. Will know more after follow-up appointment with my oncologist on Feb 7th and appointment with radiation oncologist on Feb 4th. At least I know what to expect after my previous chemo this fall.  As far as recovery I would say the worst is the under arm healing. The drains came out on the 6th day after surgery along with the staples. One third of my stitches came out today and the remaining ones will come out next Tuesday. I have fibromyalgia so am having some arm stiffness due to a bad shoulder on the right side. I can lift the arm to my shoulder which is what my surgeon is asking of me at this time and I have some wall exercises to help.. and a visit from my massage therapist tomorrow afternoon. I showered the Saturday after coming home, I just kept my right side away from the water and used a hand held shower massage thing to control where the water went. Mom did help me somewhat and still is. The one thing I have problems with is picking things up off of the floor.  I am hoping to be able to go oversee an event I have for work on Sunday, surgeon said I could try and put on a bra and see if I am comfortable... I hope so, having this one large floppy thing when I go out on the left side is driving me nuts! Not being able to drive myself anywhere is making a bit crazy...thank goodness for Mom! my best friend of 42 years came to visit me this weekend and we ventured out for lunch a movie and dinner and it was a great treat! Mom has promised me some field trips the rest of this week which I am sure will help with the stiffness in my arm. Overall I am pretty happy with my progress... the tingling and tightness are more of an annoyance than painful.. thank goodness. I am very happy to have this step behind me and will see what the next couple of weeks bring my way. Thank you all for the messages!",
