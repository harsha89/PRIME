Hair growth is definitely an adventure.  I feel like every few days, I have a totally new head of hair to work with as it's constantly changing! ",

It's hardest for us because what we see in the mirror is so different than what we were used to seeing. I'm trying to enjoy my hair and embrace my curls.

I had it on my chest and upper arm while the port was in, and sometimes the skin was noticeably warmer. I took antibiotics and the warmness went away. But, 3 months after removing the port, I still have redness. I also have some swelling in that arm. One doc thinks I might have superficial blood clots (I've been checked for dvt), another thinks it's some sort of lymphedema (even though it's the opposite side)....I'm going to make an appointment with my BS and see what she thinks.

Glad you've gotten started on the treadmill again.  Three weeks ago, I started and was at 1.5 mph and barely made it to 15 minutes (not sore, but so tired still from chemo).  I'm up to 3 mph and 45 minutes about 5x a week.  It gets a little easier every day and I feel so accomplished when I think about how tough it was just a few short weeks ago.  So, keep going...it's going to get better and better.  I know the radiation doesn't make things any easier, so double kudos to you!",

Karmil710 - So sorry about your laptop!  I've done the same...and destroyed 2 iPhones all in about an 18 month span - that was an expensive year for me!  I'll be anxious to hear how your TE exchange goes - you must be so excited.  My BMX is Monday, too - they tell me it'll be about an 11 hour surgery (BMX, Lat Flaps, TE's) which makes me nervous, but I'm looking forward to getting it behind me! Michelle - I had swelling in my legs and face during treatment, but nothing that altered what I was able to wear.  My MO checked my shins and ankles at every visit and the nurses asked me about it at every treatment, so I think it's something they watch.  I'm 6 weeks out and mine seems to be all but gone.  My face is back to normal and I have a small amount in my lower legs that is barely palpable.  I'm glad you're pushing for resolution - water retention can drive your blood pressure higher, which is hard on your heart. Heather B - thanks for the tip about not covering up so much at night.  I tried it and actually got a decent amount of rest last night!  The hot flashes aren't as frequent as they were, but I feel like they last longer now (it's still only a few minutes each time).  No night sweats and from the sound of things, I'm very thankful for that!  I'm knocking on wood so I don't jinx myself. CKK - Thanks!  You're right, our bodies have been through a ton in a very short period of time.  I think we all need to remind ourselves of that from time to time when we get frustrated with our limitations. Rachel - just so you know, I read your posts and feel exhausted.  You amaze me!  I've been in a kind of self-imposed isolation since diagnosis.  First because I was in shock, then because I was afraid of getting sick during treatment and now because I really just don't know how to \"be\" when I'm out and about anymore.  I'm getting better, but it's a weird process coming to realize that I'm just not the same person that I used to be.  Reading your stuff makes me wonder if I'd have slid back into \"normal life\" easier if I hadn't taken myself out of it so completely for these last few months.  I admire how active you've managed to stay.  So glad that you're nearing the finish line now.",

The lumpectomy was a total success, but finding out I was triple neg made me want to take the most aggressive path possible. I was 6 weeks PFC when I had the surgery and I do think that made it harder. I ended up needing blood transfusions after surgery, was checked repeatedly for clots...just a tough recovery all around. My IV failed twice and we weren't able to get it back in, so as soon as the transfusions were done, we gave it up. I had to remove my port during the bmx due to infection. But, it sure would've come in handy this past week! After all that, I still think I'd have done it the exact same way if I could go back. I had a lot of time to come to peace with it. I had a lot of \"friends\" telling me that I was crazy to do the bmx since I was stage 1, but I never doubted myself. I feel my meds kicking in, so my next nap is in order. Thank you all for the support. It means so much.",

So glad that everyone seems to be handling them well. Rachel - hope you're over the hump and starting to feel better. So happy that this is the last time you'll go through this cycle. That article about over-diagnosis must've been everywhere. When I saw it, I got all fired up and had a whole discussion about how it didn't make any sense to me with my family (they all agree). I was only 33 at diagnosis and tend to lean toward even earlier mammo's, even though I know that's just fear talking. When I heard how much more sensitive breast MRI's are, I remember wondering why they weren't the standard of care. I'm in the camp where I'd rather have false alarms than miss something, you know? I happened to get lucky and my tumor attached to a cyst, so I felt it even though I had very dense breasts. By the time I would have had my first mammo... As for me, recovery from this surgery is harder than I expected. I'm up and around a bit and trying to do more. I've just never had anything hold me back for long and I have limited patience for it! I hope you're all doing well and starting to feel better...oh, I started latisse last night. Can't tell you how excited I was. I was looking for growth already this morning (clearly, patience is not my forte). Again, you're all in my thoughts and I'm so glad you're here.",

      "Content": "Mar 26, 2012 10:12AM - edited Mar 26, 2012 10:17AM by Jen78 I will post the list of supplements that were recommended, for those that asked. It's been a crazy couple of days and I left the list with my mom...who is going to pick them up for me. I asked my MO about Metformin last week and he won't prescribe it for me since it's still in trials. Part of me is thinking that I'm going to ask my regular doc for it and see how that goes. The MO did tell me that baby aspirin has shown some promise in preventing recurrence, so I'll start that after surgery. Rachel - I hope you're having a better day. Sounds like a whole bunch of junk came your way at once. I'm 6 weeks PFC and other than some aches and pains, I'm having a lot of good days. Some days are tough, but the good far outweighs the bad. You're almost there. So, while your survivor friend experienced it one way, I think you'll blow her away with how well you do. You've kept going all through treatment which is going to help you. Momof3boys - totally with you. Figuring out who we are now is tough. I've been trying to get back into my old routine as much as possible, which has helped. Sometimes I feel like if I pretend to be back to normal, eventually I will be. It's a new theory...we'll see how it goes. Hope you're all having a nice weekend.",

I looked in a mirror a couple days after surgery and the inside half of one of mine is gone!!! Tape must've gotten it during surgery. It bothered me more than I'd have guessed possible under the circumstances. Hoping it fills back in quickly. I'm with all of you on avoiding all things negative. I find that I only watch comedies lately and avoid everything else entirely. I guess we've all just had enough of the stuff that brings you down.",
