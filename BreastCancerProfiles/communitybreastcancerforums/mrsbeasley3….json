I have felt some twinging in my chest area. not neccessarily my breast area.  but the techs forewarned me about this twinging feeling I may experience.  Seems to happen a couple of hours after treatment.  Maybe it is my body trying to clean itself up after the radiation influx.  My RO told me that he does not expect me to get tired.  I am thinking he is trying to keep me optimistic.  I have been working out and do feel like It gives me great stamina for all this. Keeps me healthier. I am prone to get pink and I know from being  a redhead that the whitest virgin skin burn will hurt like none other. Also I think the smaller the boob the better .....finally a good reason to have small ta ta's :) So far my only sympton was the first day after I felt like I was kinda gettin a virus ...maybe I was ......maybe it was my body fighting.off the rads....but after that I have felt great. My aerola  (sp) is tender already but no big deal.  I can just tell it is more sensitive than it was before.",

Maybe I should use some cold compresses too? I have had some sunburns in my day and this is not what I expected.  It is not warm and it does not burn. It just slowly turned red but I have had sunburns much more painful than this.",

My doc was going to send me to a breast surgeon for a biopsy but after I did not get a call in a week I called the hospital that did my mammos and instead of going to a surgeon where they would have cut into me , I had the stereotatic biopsy at the hospital and they referred me to the breast clinic. BTW the surgeons office never did call me for an appointment. Everyone's experience is different and maybe 99 out of 100 people do their jobs but sometimes you are that one patient that got the scheduler on a bad day or something.",
