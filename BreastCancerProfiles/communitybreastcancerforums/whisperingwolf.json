Now I'm scheduled for another one this Friday afternoon. I'm having surgery in the first week of May (date not determined yet) so this will help them with determining details about the surgery, as well as if I'll need raditation after the surgery.  What I'm worried about is - what if it shows the cancer has actually *spread* rather than having gotten smaller? Now I know it's responded because the four large tumors my oncologist could feel in my right breast before treatment - he cannot feel at *all* anymore so I take that as a good sign. But I'm guessing I won't get results until Monday. How do I stay sane until then? Any ideas? Dx 12/15/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 1/5 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

After being diagnosed with Stage 3 IDC in December, I found out I was BRCA2+ ...and that my paternal grandmother had BC in her early 30's, her mother died of an unknown cancer in her 30s, and I have a cousin who also developed BC but in her 40s. I also have very dense breast tissue (until they remove it next month that is!), and have had no children. So I suppose if a younger person is going to get it...it would be me.   I've finished chemotherapy, and am having surgery in May. After that I may or may not have radiation, and then will be on Tamoxifen for 5 years. Dx 12/15/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 1/5 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
