I had my first mammogram around 41 where my doc and the breast clinic established a baseline (this is what my doc said after I was called back for mag views,ultrasounds, and 6-12 month follow ups..) These tests came back as benign findings and it was recommended that I have 'regular breast screenings for low risk patient's afterward. So fast forward a few years and doc recommends another routine mammogram... Which I do. I'm called back for more views and tests..after which they classify as probably benign and ask for another diagnostic mag view in 6 months. After getting the diagnostic they're recommending the cluster be biopsied with no mention of an ultrasound. Edit: they never even mentioned ultrasound.. those are my words. They just recommended biopsy and never ordered an ultrasoind during this proscess. (With my first mammogram, they did). Log in to post a reply",

We were born 3 days apart.. and when she died, I scheduled a mammogram in her honor. After the mammogram, I needed a diagnostic and ultrasound, but in the end, they were classified as benign and It wasn't recommended I do regular mammograms for high risk patients. My PCP told me it wouldn't be horrible if I did my mammogram at Q2-3 years being that I was considered low risk. So after my yearly well woman in September of last year my doc said it's time for a routine mammogram again, which I scheduled. Like the first mammogram, I was brought in for a diagnostic after, which said, 'likely benign' redo in 6mo. I want to also share that with my normal yearly work up(along with this mammogram), my hydroxy vit D levels were severely deficient .. doc ordered OTC supplements which I didn't take very seriously at the time. Several months later, I'm constantly getting sick and fatigued... another vit d hydroxy is taken and my deficinacy is now critically low.. I am now taking supplements and feeling much better! Last week it was time to do my 6mo follow up diagnostic mammogram. I got a message stating that the radiologists want to biopsy the 'new micro calcifications' to rule out cancer (says most likely benign) And I'm not overly worried about cancer.. but when you put the new 'microcalcifications' and my sudden and severe D deficiency (5.2 in April .... it makes me wonder if there is a correlation here..
