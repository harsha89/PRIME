I did have the full axillary disection (12 nodes removed)- I am not sure if i agree with this - but it is what it is at this point. My surgeon supported me in going to Sloan Kettering to get a second opinion but she was not very fond of the Cancer Centers of America- she said she would go somewhere that specialized in breast cancer.  I hope this helps - please let me know if you have other questions. Oh one last thing....because my tumor was .6cm - the oncotype came back inconclusive...that's another reason I chose to be aggressive - not knowing my oncotype score.

I have a question for everyone - do any of the doctors say there is a way to prevent the mouth sores?  Is the baking soda/salt water mix supposed to help \"prevent\" or just treat them once they appear?

They have such a group where I get treatment and I was invited to go to this support group when I was first diagnosed by my nurse navigator (I think there definition of \"young is loose) I only went two times when I was going through treament and then stopped going. I just went again last month and it really is encouraging to hear others stories and know that you are not alone in your feelings and thoughts. I am so glad I went this last month; I have to look at it as it's an investment in myself instead of just giving up more time to cancer. Know that you are not alone; its a shitty disease and it is frustrating when people look at you after your treatment and think that you should be just the same as you used to be.

I am taking my four year old with me as she is so curious about the doctor and hospital and who is helping me momma treat her \"owies.\"  It is so hard to talk to my 4 year old about this and yikes she is scared about moms hair falling out. She is convinced she won't know who I am - what a sweet innocent girl. :) Here are some words of inspiration for today: Some days there won't be a song in your heart.

Anyone else want to join in?  It would be fun knowing we were all doing something on the same day! Well my hair was falling out in clumps yesterday - it was a complete mess in the shower so I decide it was time to shave it off.  I went and met with a man at a salon who specializes in wigs and he is ordering me a wig....it is super natural and matches my hair color.  I am still not sure if I will be comfortable wearing it but it was only $250 so i have it as an option. I have a really hard time looking at myself in the mirror - it's just so hard knowing the hair is completely gone.  I have lost my inner eyelashes too - has anyone else lost eyelashes or eye brows yet? Bren58- i am glad your side effects aren't too bad and that you are managing ok - I go on 12/26 and pray that it's not tood bad. :) Take care everyone - I pray that you have a a great weekend!",

I just finished my second chemo today - it was non-eventful - thank you God.  I was there from 8-1pm.  I am home and tired as I didn't sleep well from the steroids and worrying. :) Here are some tips that my doc gave me this time: i am going to take the claritin tonight instead of in the morning (for the neulasta pain) as he said I might not feel as \"foggy\" from taking it. He also suggested the salt and baking soda rinse a few times per day to help with mouth sores. He was ok with me taking a probiotic and one a day vitamin. My blood counts were awesome last time so he said i should just be careful until the weekend and then I could go on with normal life.  And he gave me the OK to fly on a plane to MI for work on 1/8! All is good so far - I pray that it is not too bad in terms of the SE.  I pray that each of you are doing well!",

I burst into tears!  It was an incredible feeling of happiness and accomplishment but then also the sense of fear - that i never ever want to go through this again. I then went up to my MO's afterwards and got my prescription for tamoxifen.  Started on it today and reminded myself that this is going to help me more than the chemo or radiation. I know I need to take it and I am not going to second guess it. Gwen -thanks for your words of wisdom and inspiration!",

I am totally dreading my hair falling out in the next week.  I am not sure if I should cut it shorter now - already did a short cut but should I cut it into a pixie cut this weekend or wait until it falls out?  I know it is coming and the wait is hard on me. On another note, my company that I work for (100 person consulting firm) did the nice thing for me!  I work from Milwaukee and all of them are in Michigan.  They all wore pink for me last Friday and they took a ton of photos and sent well wishes from each person on a huge poster and framed artwork.  It was so touching that they did this and I am going to hang these things where they will give me inspiration on the more difficult days.  I hope everyone is doing well and see the positive things in each day.  I know it is hard but try to smile and enjoy the small things right now!",

One question for everyone - are you taking a multi-vitamin?  And did anyone's doctor recommend a probiotic to help with stomach issues and yeast infections?  Just curious. Ok dreading this week as I know I am going to lose my hair.  I have only bought hats and scarves so far as I am afraid of wigs being uncomfortable and too fake looking.  But maybe I should go out and try a bunc on and find one.",
