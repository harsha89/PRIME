    "Content": "pmac wrote: Hello everyone, So, due to a very very strong family history of breast cancer and after doing breast cancer genetic testing, I chose to have a preventative double mastectomy with reconstruction (implants) all in one surgery (after seeking the opinion of my current family doctor, my previous family doctor that I still contact from time to time and 2 surgeons and all saying it was a very wise decision on my part so I went ahead with it).  I am now 3 weeks after surgery (no nipples at this point) and although I have to say I am overall happy with where I am at with my recovery, I am finding myself a little discouraged that I still have to take 1 oxycodone at around 5am in the morning when I wake up in pretty bad pain.  During the day, I can manage with taking only advil and on occasion Tylenol #1 with codeine.   I was really hoping to not have to still be taking the oxy at this point but for some reason the middle of the night is quite painful still.  I will admit, I do not have a high pain tolerance but I was hoping to get some insight from other people on their experience.  Of course, I understand everyone is different.  On a side note, I am located in Ontario Canada and I run a home daycare to which I cater to only teacher parents.  Therefore, I am closed for the school summer break (July and August).  I was lucky enough to have my surgery second week of July and I am praying that I will be able to be up and running again August 27th as I have a few little ones starting August 27th as their moms (teachers) are going back to work that week.  I am almost fully functional right now with the exception of picking up heavy items.  I am cooking, cleaning, going grocery shopping etc.  (my sister is staying with me as my husband has now gone back to work so she is helping me with all those things).   I may have started pushing myself too hard too soon.  Not sure.  I just met with my surgeon and he is impressed and thinks everything looks great.  One concerning thing is that my skin above my implants on my chest feels as if I have a sunburn.  It's painful and scratchy feeling.   I would GREATLY appreciate anybody chiming in with their experience and hopefully giving me some hope that I will be able to run my home daycare again with my 5 little ones!!
