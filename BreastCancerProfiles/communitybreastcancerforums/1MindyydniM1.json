I know that in my heart this is my decision but damn..the reality......its actually slapping me in the face! I would like to know what to expect and any advice I could use....like what to take to hospital etc. ANY certain thing people/doctors may have left out. I go on Jan 13 to see my ps to talk about reconstruction...implants..etc.Â  Thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",
