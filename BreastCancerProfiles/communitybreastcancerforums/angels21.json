The orginal findings in the breast as well as lungs have also increased..im extremely scared now.the consultant had orginallyput mum on letrozole since last august but it stopped working a couple of months ago.we are wondering if she should have put her on chemo first.the progression seems rapid. Feel helpless..we will push for chemo as quick as possible. Its strange mum has no physical symptoms apart from tiredness..which is more than before.her blood test results are ok..is this something that can be tackled?? Has anyone had the same sort of progression and had control with chemo??..I feel numb right now and alone..",

I am going to do that shortly.as of now the doctor would like to proceed with chemo as the cancer is spreading. The other option is tamoxifen but by the time that enters the system the cancer could progress further.mum is going to have her appointment this week..I feel tensed. I just feel we should control this deadly disease Asap.i know chemo is strong stuff..im wondering how her body will cope.mum is quite active and in good health. Only thing is she gets bouts of tiredness..does your mother get this too??with all this going on she still doesn't have many symptoms. Which proves how clever this disease works.i agree with u..we have to stay strong for our mums, they are precious.if they see us down it wont help.This forum is helping me immensely. Iv spent nights twisting and turning..cant imagine not hearing mums voice, her laugh. .bit too much at times..will try and stay postive..I wish u and ur mother all the best.thank you for being there xx",

Is there anything you recommend mum should be taking to prepare her for chemo. Shes eating mostly healthy stuff, broccoli, kale, vegs, fruit..iv asked her to try green tea, heard that fights cancer..you are certainly right im the only child..if I had siblings it wouldve been easier for me to cope..im fortunate to be in touch with lovely ladies as yourself.i hope ur doing well..You asked where I was from..im based in the UK. .",

The scan shows that her breast cancer has spread to the liver. Mum was diagnosed a year ago and the disease presented itself in the breast as well as lung nodules. This discovery has left me devastated as we thought the medication she was on for the last year:letrozole was controlling things.it has stopped working. We have been advised today to start chemo within 2 weeks:chlorphosphomide 6 cycles. Has anyone gone through a similar situation? Is it common for drugs to stop working? Has anyone been able to control symptoms for a long time? Im so scared.im the only child of my parents.dont want to lose mum.cant face this.not sure what to expect from chemo?are there any stories of hope? Log in to post a reply",

She slept very well during the night.i was restless as I was looking out for any side effects.so far no vomiting or nausea. We are taking the drugs and steroids as directed.Â  The experience took it out of me initially but il try and build up strength to keep going and stay brave..not sure which what head gear will be suitable..il look on the internet..i agree wigs are abit hard to cope with in summer.i like the bandanas.they look cool.i said to mum make sure u wear ur lovely burgundy lipstick. .her trademark. How are your kids doing?? How did they cope with the news?? Being a parent is a huge responsibility..im sure they are ur recovery by themselves. .children are full of hope and innocence. . Thank u for being there. .dont feel so alone..appreciate ur encouragement...xxx",

I hope all is well with you.just getting an insight into your experiences is amazing . Charlotte you sound like a real fighter.i must confess I have been devastated by mums progression. I was at work when I heard the news..it was like hearing the diagnosis for the first time..just burst into tears. I can totally relate to the closeness you share with ur daughter..im the same with mum. so used to hearing her voice on the end of the phone.she is my best friend and back bone.prior to this discovery of breast cancer my father had a severe phycotic attack. He stopped eating and drinking. We had 3 years of high stress, in and out of hospitals. Mum has always put herself last and now this has happened.the specialists have not discussed the chemo process in great detail yet.i know our lives are going to change very soon.mum is keeping herself going but I know she is scared.its natural I guess.she is going to lose her hair.i hear this happens quite quick.i will get her some colourful scarves. will certainly get mum a ipad/ tablet. Like you suggested it will be good for her to join a forum like this.the stories iv read are simply inspirational..is there any special diet you follow?? Or vitamins you take?? Mum does yoga and it makes her feel better.Its so nice to hear that you will be a grand mother soon.congratulations.exciting time for your family.you are right a mother/ daughter relationship is so special.treasure those moments.lesson to learn is enjoy every minute.thank you for reassuring me.means the world. Will keep you updated on developments. Love and best wishes Angeline.",
