I had weekly Taxol and Herceptin, then a pause, then lumpectomy and three lymph nodes removed. The WONDERFUL news is that there was no sign of cancer in lump or nodes! Now I am doing the year of Herceptin and radiation. Second radiation today. So far it's fine. My RO said to use aloe vera and lotion to soothe my breast. (So far no discomfort.) I asked about using green tea and was told that since it is an antioxidant, it would be better not to use it! I guess different POs have different takes on this, huh? I am thrilled to say that I now have fur on my head! About Â¼\" long now. I am tempted to go topless now that there is fur. It doesn't look that bad in my opinion! Anyway, thanks for all the kindness and support! Susan",
