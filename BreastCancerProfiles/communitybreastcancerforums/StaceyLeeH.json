My DMX is scheduled for the middle of June. I am also nervous about how I will feel after surgery. I am unable to start reconstruction right away because of radiation treatment. So that's part of my worry I will have to spend 4 months with no breasts or areoles or nipples.... My plastic surgeon said you run the risk of moving the expanders with radiation. May I ask which reconstruction surgery you went through? Wishing you the best with the rest of your recovery. Faith, love, hope, Stacey",
