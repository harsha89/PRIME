      "Content": "Feb 14, 2009 11:33PM - edited Feb 14, 2009 11:44PM by See Hi Ladies, I am 44, left side Lumpectomy, <1cm IDC, Nodes 0/8 , PR and ER +, Her2 Neg, Stage 1 , grade 2, no family history of BC. If all went well , I shall be starting 25 rounds of  rads Monday. Did the markings yesterday. Was rather nervous at first and feels funny having them \"drawing\" on my body like I am a piece of canvas for them to paint on . Was not too happy with my onc(2nd onc)  . The first one wanted me to do bone and ct scan of which i decline and decide to switch onc as I don't like his face  . I like my breast surgeon she is so much more considerate of my finance (I don't have insurance). Will be doing a chest x ray (??) on Monday and ultra sound on abdomen (do anyone have US on their abdomen done?I wander if it is necessary to the the US of my abdoment or just another way for onc to earn $$$, the onc clinic is new and hardly have any patients ). My lumpectomy was done by another center. I pick a different center to do my rads as it's nearer my home so that it makes my daily traveling less stressful.  Breast surgeon says no need Chemo just Rads . Onc propose chemo which he says put me into  4% less chance of recurrence which I decline much to his disappointment (could see his disappointed look) All the best to the other rads ladies.",

As far as lack of pooping, remember that for every day you don't eat it's at least 2 days of not pooping, and that the pain meds will bind you up something fierce for a few days. I used to like to mix milk of mag and prune juice in with some coffee and serve it warm to patients - the Bronx Bomb worked like a charm!!!! It gives me a bit of a different perspective, because there is nothing that grosses me out other than phlegm - it's my Kriptonite!!! Hoping everyone gets pooping soon - hugs!!",

I got to see my incision today, and it's actually really nice - my underarm is a little more raw, but it's more skin irritation than anything else. The strangest sensation is the numbness - I know that some of it is here to stay. I don't get to take a shower until the drains come out, which is next Wednesday at the earliest. Trying to use my arm as much as possible and not let my shoulders tighten up. Hope everyone else is holding up well! ",
