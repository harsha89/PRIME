I had to have one of mine(on the cancer & radiation side) removed almost a month ago due to infection and then skin problems.  It sounds like you made the right decision to remove the other one. In your shoes I think I would have done the same thing. There was no sign of problems with my other one, so I kept it, and it does seem to be \"anchoring\" things well so far. Like you, being flat was never part of my plan.  But I knew for a month or two that it was a possibility, so I had some time to get used to the idea.  It is hard emotionally, especially at first. Now I still look down and think I can't quite believe that I only have one breast(implant).  Like anything, it will take time to truly come to terms with it all. My PS tells me too that my only choice for recon is a flap procedure. I don't think I want to do it, but I figure time will tell there too.  I'm still getting used to my new body.  I don't have a prosthesis yet, but am wearing a \"leisure form\" most of the time, which is working out well.  I think I want to see what warmer weather brings.  If I have trouble with my prosthesis in summer clothes or swimsuits I might just decide it's worth another surgery.  But then flap procedures sometimes fail as well and I'm not sure I want to take that chance either!  I guess we should both let ourselves heal and put off any decisions for awhile. Wishing you all the best and a quick recovery. Take care. Angela",

I was referred to one before they even did a biopsy.  The surgeon is often instrumental in determining if and how to biopsy it and then how to proceed. Sometimes it's a breast surgeon, but sometimes it might be a general surgeon. I had a core needle biopsy, plenty of soreness and bruising, but no hematoma from it, so I can't be of any help there. I'm sure it's very painful. Ice and tylenol are the best ideas I can offer for relief. I just wanted to tell you we all have some idea how you're feeling right now.  It's a scary, uncertain time. In some ways, you will feel better once you know what, if anything, you are dealing with and can get on with taking care of it. Remember, though, there is still a good chance this mass may turn out to be benign.  I hope and pray that is the case.  Hang in there.  We are here if you need us.",

Told us any one of them is a reasonable course of action for this diagnosis and at her age.  So my Mom has some decisions to make.  In the end it's up to her how she wants to handle it. Angela ",

Not only is this a \"sneaky\" cancer, as mentioned above, but it is somewhat more likely than ductal cancer to recur in the other breast. So I just felt safer being rid of the breast tissue on both sides. I have never regreted that decison. Also, I had decided on reconstruction and being large breasted and saggy at 50, I felt I could achieve symmetry easier with a bilateral.  My surgeon didn't bring up the idea of the bilateral with me either, but when asked about it, felt that my reasons were good ones.

I did sew pockets into a couple of swimsuits myself recently.  I ordered pockets at www.tlcdirect.org and they are quite inexpensive, but I have found their regular shipping to be rather slow, so you might have to spring for faster shipment. I just hand sewed them into one bathing suit I had and another tankini top that I purchased to go with bottoms I had. We're all different in what kind of swimsuit works for us.  I have one implant and one flat side and I find that the style that hides everything I need to hide best is a bandeau style.  I haven't found anything else that I think is flattering to my body and covers enough to withstand scrutiny. Some other styles are OK on me, but if anyone looked closely they'd be able to tell something is not quite right there. But if there is one thing I've learned in my BC journey, is that people are not scrutinizing our appearance as much as we think they are. What a sweet hubby you have! Good luck with your swimsuits and have a wonderful trip. Angela",

My own daughter is 23 and lives far away and I wish I could just give you a big hug.  Try to find things to keep you busy while you wait for results. Exercise helps with the stress and may help you sleep too. I wish you much luck and will keep you in my prayers. Angela",

ALL of this is very scary and overwhleming, especially at first. I remember thinking that I'd wake up and realize it was all just a bad dream. Sometime I still think that a year and a half later. It's had to believe now, but it WILL get better. You will learn how to cope.  Take everything one step at a time as much as you can. We are all here for you! Soon after my diagnosis someone gave me a little \"courage angel\" figurine.  She's got her arms raised up over her head like she just experienced some wonderful triumph.  Whenever I had something scary to face, I'd look at her or close my eyes and visualize her.  Somehow that helped. Keeping you in my prayers, Angela",

When I went out, I obsessed over how to hide the bulges from them. It's easier under winter clothes. Just wondering...could they not somehow make them smaller?! You could just empty them more frequently right? I've had them several times and each time I had them removed I immediately felt 10x better! That being said,  I hope you will all find that the reality of drains is not as bad as the dread of them.  I too think it's interersting when people feel the need to weigh in on whether or not you have recon, what type, etc. When I had my mastectomies, I knew I wanted to at least try recon and what kind, so I guess I never gave anyone the chance to suggest otherwise.  When I had to have one implant removed and decided against further recon for now, there were people I told and people I just told I had surgery because of \"reconstruction issues\".  There are friends and even family I may never tell that I didn't have recon. I don't think they'll be able to tell by looking at me. And it's really none of anyone's business anyway.  God bless you all, Angela",
