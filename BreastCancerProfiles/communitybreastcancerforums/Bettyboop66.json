To make a very long story short after having to go through every type of biopsy that can be done to your breast I finally was diagnosed with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia, Atypical lobular hyperplasia and atypical columnar cell hyperplasia. Thank god it's not breast cancer, but I'm still very concerned about my risks. My surgeon referred me to an oncologist that I saw today to see what preventaitive options were available to me. She suggested starting on Tamoxifen and a follow up MRI in 6 months, she also set up an appointment with a genetic counselor to help determine my risk. Just wondering if any of you have dealt with these diagnosises? I've searched on the internet but haven't had much luck finding anything about women with all of this going on. I have no family history of breast cancer, brain and ovarian, but no breast. I have 2 very close friends right now that have just gone through mastetcomies and chemo, so this has really shaken me up. It's great to find a plce where I can talk with other women that will understand. My 30 year old daughter is understandably scared, but she and I don't always agree on medical decisions, so it's a little hard for us right now. And I can't talk with her about this as much as I would like. Thanks so much for listening and I hope to \"talk\" with you soon. Log in to post a reply",
