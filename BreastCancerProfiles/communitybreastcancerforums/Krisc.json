Don't get me wrong, this site is so valuable, and the posts are very helpful and so are the people, but until you know what you are dealing with, it is way too much information.  Information that you may not need, and alot of the information is freightening. Just ask God to give you peace and guidance and enjoy your sweet little ones and have fun this weekend.  {{{{{{{HUGS}}}}}}}} Kris ",

Trust me, I am not downplaying my diagnosis. ",

Like others have said, 80% are benign.  also if the clusters do represent a cancer, it is usually in a very very early and very treatable stage.  Best of luck to you.",
