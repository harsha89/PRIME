I'm on my 2nd cycle of it and get my 2nd infusion of this cycle (4th infusion total) on Friday. I am of course part of the unlucky 45% who lost their hair from this med...it came out in huge clumps 2 weeks after I started it. Most of the hair loss is on the top of my head (like an old man), so I decided to shave it all off. This is the 3rd time I'm dealing with being bald, but I don't think it's any easier than the 1st time. I have lost of head wraps, but I'm definitely going to get a wig this time. It looks like I'll be on Halaven for a long time if it works for me, so maybe a wig will make me feel better about it. Anyway, I'm not going to write too much in case this thread has gone inactive...it's been 3 weeks since anyone posted. I'm hoping everyone is just busy with their summer because I look forward to developing friendships with other ladies in the same shoes as me. I hope you're all doing well! Michelle",

I get a super elevated heart rate a few days after treatment...does anybody else have this? Resting heart rate is around 110, then if I simply walk from the living room to the kitchen, it skyrockets probably to 140 or higher & I start sweating profusely all over my body & I have to sit down & catch my breath & let my heart rate come down. Earlier my ears got all muffled too until I sat down & recovered. It's really scary & I wonder if I'm the only one going through this. I've been seeing a cardiologist because I'm also on Herceptin and he switched my heart medicine a few weeks before I started Halaven...I'm really not sure why. I talked to my onc about the heart rate & sweating & she sent me to see the cardiologist that day. He sent me for a CT scan fearing pulmonary embolism, but I was all clear, so he told me to increase the dose of my new heart med, but it doesn't seem to be helping. I have an appt with him on Fri, so hopefully it'll all get worked out, but I wanted to see if anyone else has this side effect because I haven't read anything about it. Thanks",
