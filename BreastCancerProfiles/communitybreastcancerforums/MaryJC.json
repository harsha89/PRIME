You can also get emergency Medicaid as well. Is there a nurse navigate or social worker at your hospital/breast center? If so they are there to help with these matters. Re your question on your mass, there's absolutely no telling! A poster that is a dear friend now shared the same characteristics as I with the masses. Hers was benign, mine was not. No telling. BUT a mass that size, IF malignant is more than likely early. Which means adjuvant treatment if needed, ie after lumpectomy. Hugs",

Had my mri Saturday night, results on Monday showed no other abnormalities in left breast which is where tumor is. Right breast had an enhancement area deeper within but nowhere else. So yet another ultrasound today of that area to ensure that's 'nothing'. But if they can't see it on the u/s or it looks 'suspicious' I then need a mri guided biopsy which due to scheduling could push back my surgery which is pissing me off!! So best case scenario this enhancement is a bunch of nothing picked up by the super sensitive mri. Otherwise if they try to keep pushing my surgery due to one appt I already told them I'd insist on still having surgery on the 17th and address whatever this is at a later date after. I'm anxious to get what we do know OUT ASAP! I was told this would be ok. Yes not best idea to have 2 surgeries but I'm opting for the double mass if I test BRCA+ at a later date so then that would take care of the the right if it's something anyway. Thoughts???  Overall I am relieved about my left breast showing nothing else and still praying no node involvement.  How is everyone else doing?",

Yes scheduled for the 17th and actually getting excited if that sounds strange enough. I'm looking forward to being God-willing cancer-free for my birthday. Me and me 'team' are dressing up for the hospital visit. The PA called me yesterday to say the surgeon wants to take whar she believes is a sebaceous cyst on the very top of my right breast. Ok fine- then if she's going after that which I beleive is really in the skin then why not take the thing in the right if its benign??? Originally the PA told me no bec they dont wanna do 'unnecessary surgery' if its benign. Nooooo, I dont want unnecessary tumors just laying around and me coming in every four months. So regardless of what this is- benign or malignany its coming out of the right too. I kinda wish I wasnt so chicken and would have the double mass- but thats part vanity and I can't afford the recoup time. Thank God my BRCA results came back negative! Thanks again, HUGS!!!",

No ones fault. Proof of need for mri bec didn't show on mamo or ultra. So if it is anything malignant that comes out on the 17th also ie lumpectomy on left and right. PA said if b9 just watch every 6 months. Asked if benign can we just take it out. Said no don't wanna do unnecessary surgery. Well I don't wanna watch n wait for nothing to turn into something and then have NECESSARY surgery SMH!!!! Still awaiting BRCA results. If +, double mass another time. How did it go for u on Friday? Do you have path reports from both now? Catch me up. Hugs to you too💞💖💝!!!!",

The 11-1 mri picked up an enhancement deep in the right that the U/S and mamo didn't. So they biopsied that on Tuesday. Was told if benign would leave it alone and watch it. I say I don't wanna watch it- take it regardless. Results came back today is benign breast tissue but the sample was so small they wanna make sure it's all benign bec it does reflect some kind of activity obviously. So PA said surgeon gonna take 'more' but benign breast tissue doesn't just 'turn' into things and very rare to have bilateral breast cancers. Told her why take some to test and not all of it? Take the whole dam thing. It's only 1.7cm of enhancement. If she's going for something in my skin that actually forms a bump above the skin then TAKE THE ENHANCED AREA in the beast for goodness sake!!! Otherwise 'watching' this requires mri and biopsy every 4-6 months bec that's the only thing that picked it up. Sigh... But I have to sign new consents anyway. And I haven't yet spoken with my surgeon. Expected to hear from her today. We may be on same page and this is mainly communication breakdown of the PA. The PA is great but is an over-talker and has made mistakes in quoting me things from my reports I catch later on. Since 3rd party, when I speak to my surgeon I'll inform her that I want that area out. Plus that's what the radiologist recommended as well. So yeah... lol. I'm excited and looking forward to Monday. I think I have everything in place including two birthday cakes- YAY! I'm a psychotherapist and have reframed this to be the start of a beautiful new year and renewed MaryJC, God willing",

As the mods said, research and get to know more about the disease and your specific diagnosis. You'll learn how it's treated. Another poster said on another thread that the survival rates on google are not updated. I found this to be true. So don't let that freak you out- promise! The thing that disturbed me about this journey is that the surgery is the easy part! In most illness you get a diagnosis, then meds, then surgery, then you heal. Breast cancer, you have surgery, then you get diagnosed, then medication. It's unnerving every round. It bothered me to know that after surgery I'm still waiting and nervous, scared.

From all I've read high bp makes u more suseptible for lowered EF and they'll put you on beta blockers or ACE inhibitors. Either way I pray it goes back up.

And altho it is info purposes, I've always felt like it's putting a forever stamp on oneself. Just me. But I did it bec you're right. That's the same reason why I was so distraught about having chemo (adjuvant). I knew it would put me in the emotional space as still having cancer when it was in fact cut out and treatment is to prevent recurrence. But we all have the same 'look' underneath it all. I hate looking in the mirror and the thought 'cancer' comes to mind. In psychotherapy there's an area called content verses process. Neither is more important than the other, nor right or wrong. However in any given moment one may be heavier than the other for the person. I've found that for me in this BC experience, my princess is all about the content. So there is no emotional escape. Or is there? Altho I've told myself over n over: MJ, this is to prevent recurrence. You don't have cancer anymore, The lack of eyebrows and several appts quickly fades out those words. Regardless of adjuvant or neoadjuvant, we should all look in our mirrors- external mirror and internal mirror- and see a very extremely old lady that can say: BC, oh yeah I had a touch of that waaaaaay back, like 50 years ago. I almost forgot about that. I'm gonna work on making that my new process regardless of the content of what I am preservering thru today. Okay now let's see you this thing looks. And PS: sorry girls for all the head space stuff. After all I am a therapist😉 lol. Hugs to Us!!!",

They lost all body hair- meaning no hair returned so if your hair on legs comes back it is an indication that the rest will return too. That's what it was for me. My hair on my legs was outright furry but had these faint blond hairs on my head. Also clinically ladies that have a thyroid dysfunction were to unfortunately have permanent hair loss. I've read there is a specific lab work for the thyroid test and not just the regular levels. I know for sure it can feel like forever so like our other sister said vent away Hi Paxton: thanks girl!

Fasting is much more challenging during and after chemo. Funny I'm finding it harder after chemo. Not sure y tho. But I do suspect that my cells need nourishing regardless of the intake bec they've all been poisoned. Of course with the best foods are best. No more hives. Ewww. Those were gross😤! Not sure if they would have come back with a new infusion tho. But they went down instantly with brhedryl. I had jalapeños on Monday. Yummy! Lemme know soon as u can enjoy again",

Taxotere is the devil for sure! I never had to have a nuelestra shot so not sure about liver enzymes. Have you checked the chemo care site? They seem to have more info on the unsual details of treatment. How do you feel tho?",

But I took benedryl and it worked super fast, like minutes. Yes I've joined onto the coconut oil movement. I use it on my scalp but with prayer lol in the hopes it'll help my hair to start regrowing. I've only used topically so far n not eaten yet. Have you? I'm still learning about all its uses. I too was a lil anxious about having only 4. But I've read studies about 4 vs 6 and 6 maybe being too much/unnecessary, also that rates btwn the two are minimal. I had wanted to stop regardless of the SEs bec I just felt poisoned and wanted to focus on nutrition. Before chemo my lifestyle n diet was fantastic. Chemo made me eat the worst!!! I had this master plan and nope! One cycle- btwn chemo tongue and funky GI track, I could only tolerate tomato cheese and mustard sandwiches and sugary cereals. I haven't gone down the cereal aisle in God knows how long. And have never given to my child. Didn't even realize I'd never gone down the aisle since he was born until when he saw all the cereals towering over him in the big colorful boxes he saw WOW MAMA WHATS THAT! THERES DORA, THERES A BUNNY, etc etc. lol. So I was bummed about the chemo and my diet during chemo. Just wanted to get back on course and it's been a struggle. I'm on a fast now. Ate Sunday, next meal will be Wednesday. Hope to cleanse my pallate and resume healthy. Also sugar exacerbates neuropathy and is in so much foods in so many forms. Also have resumed running. Gotta go to sleep so I can enjoy my run in the morning. Hugs and feel better soon! PS: what r u doing for your temps? Did you let your onc know? Please do if u haven't. I drank cold water and put ice packs on my feet n forehead when I got sick so it would stay beneath 100.4.",

Took Benadryl which worked but woke up with more this am. Glad to know I'm not the only one. Called on call onc who was so casual and blaze'. said no way could be chemo bec was too long ago. But if other se's develop days after, such as chemo tongue, watery eyes, etc why can't this? It's scary bec when u research it- says hives can be a pre-symptom to other cancers. Anyway I'm happy to read that it cleared up for most of you. I pray does same for me. I have 2 more to go and was literally just considering forgoing #6 bec I'm concerned about what this is doing to my system.",

She referred me to the oncology nutritionist who told me (other than decreasing my Vit D a little bit) to change NOTHING which includes juicing. At this moment bec of the season/finances not juicing but I'm cleared to resume any time. I also am huge on intermittent fasting, I take ALA, ALC, also probiotics which have been proven clinically to be effective. I also take Papaya Leaf extract for wbc and blood platelet levels. Check out the reviews on Amazon and Sloan Kettering did a clinical study proving it shrinks tumors and improves counts. My tumor did indeed shrink. Not only could I feel it go from chick pea size, the payhology proved it. This I believe was my juicing (at the time) IF (intermittent fasting) and paw paw leaf (papaya leaf extract) Next post will share about fasting during infusion cycle and minimizing SEs. Well like I said, here's my 2¢! Hugs to all💞💜 ",
