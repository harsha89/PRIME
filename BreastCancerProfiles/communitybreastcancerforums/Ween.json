Her initial diagnosis was in April 2003 and she said she was diagnosed with Stage 2b with four positive lymphnodes. Her cancer returned in February 2011. Once she passed away, I learned that her initial diagnosis was actually Stage 3b with 16 positive lymphnodes. My question ....  has anyone else dealt with a patient that down played their diagnosis to an extent that was not truthful?  Hope I don't sound too judgmental, I'm just trying to understand why this occurred. Even in the end, she refused to sign a DNR and if anyone questioned her about this, she would snap \"you go sign a DNR.\"  I was thinking that this may have been an extreme form of denial.  She had two children (ages 15 and 10) so maybe that is why.  I know no one really has the answer to this question, but was hoping you kind ladies could give me your perspective.  Thanks everyone.  I pray for each and everyone of you on BCO every single day.",

Thank you in advance to all you kind and brave ladies.  That is so nice of you to create this thread for those of us that are not Stage IV. ",
