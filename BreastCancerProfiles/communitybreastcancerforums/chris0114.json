This may represent confluence of structures close to the nipple. However, it appears separate from the nipple on some views. Further evaluation is recommended.\" I'm scheduled to have another targeted ultrasound on Monday, followed by a diagnostic mammogram if the radiologist finds it necessary. What can I expect from this visit on Monday? (or is it different dependent upon the practice). I've never had a result like this before. Everything's always been fine (I am almost 49 yo). I'm hoping that I will get concrete answers on Monday and not have to wait a few days for the results to come back. Thanks for any perspective. I am stressed out about this even though I am trying not to be. Log in to post a reply",
