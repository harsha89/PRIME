Today is one week out and I shaved my legs this morning and stripped my own drains. I think I do too much in the mornings and by early evening am wiped, but I feel too antsy to sit still for so long. Starting the Handmaid\u2019s Tale today - hope it\u2019s a good watch. Shark week was getting to be a bit (get it?) much. Vermonster, you and I are beach ball twins, it looks more uncomfortable than it is. I drink as much black coffee as I do water to try and help. Not much luck, but overall I feel pretty good. Praying for positive news soon on the pathology. Hope all is well with each of you.",

I found myself trying to go over my past few years for an identifier (my Breast Surgeon even asked once), but other than being a tax accountant nothing really stands out. You ladies have overcome so much not including this dreaded disease. I'm so proud and incredibly blessed to have you at my 'side' as we finish strong. I am 26/33 treatments in today. My skin is browning a little in some of the worst spots, like a bad sunburn about to peel. Still very sore and VERY tired, but trying to keep up with yoga to stretch out my stiff arm and walking when I can. Still slathering on the Silvadene, Miaderm, and aloe. Have been icing my chest lately too - feels so good (where I can feel it after mastectomy ðŸ˜‰). Most of my itchy rash has cleared up so I feel that was related to chemo. My boosts will start this Friday and I think I will luck out and finish by late next week! What a way to ring in the new year! I am loving all the puppy posts, this thread truly gets me! How are you all doing with the Christmas holiday fast approaching? I got out of hosting this year. Makes me a little sad, but my cousin who took over this year just got a puppy so that brightens it for me a smidge. In keeping with the pup posts I'll add his new puppy! Until next time, as Urdrago says - hydrate, slather, rest, and repeat! ",

Urdrago, so close - you're into single digits with me! Sillyoldrabbit, I was advised to keep my skin lotioned during chemo as it tends to dry you out. Also, my RO mentioned to keep up with it before and after treatments for sometime to keep the skin happy. Sorry to hear you're getting into that itchy, burn time - you've held up amazingly! I agree with you that the cause is likely not one thing. Shrug shrug indeed. Am I the only one battling fatigue or general malaise? Hydrate, slather, rest, repeat! Good night!",
