When it was first discovered in July07 it was way too big to do anything. I don't know how many lymph's will be removed.  Hopefully only the first chain as my surgeon called it. I say good bye to and good riddance to bad rubbish. Then I can tackle the other areas of cancer. (bones, liver) I'm scared and concerned about recovery on my left arm.  (that's the side of my breast cancer) I'm left handed and hope I will have full usage.  Any words or thoughts about recovery or anything at all about surgery from any of you survivors, I would be most grateful. All of you have been my inspiration from time to time. Log in to post a reply",

One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord. Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand. Sometimes there were two sets of footprints, other times there was one only. This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life when I was suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat, I could see only one set of footprints, so I said to the Lord, \"You promised me, Lord, that if I followed you, you would walk with me always. But I noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there have only been one set of footprints in the sand. Why, when I have needed you most have you not been there for me?\" The Lord replied, \"The times when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you.\" Mary Stevenson, 1936 Log in to post a reply",

Above all don't go alone.  You WILL not hear everything that's beng said to you.  Someone else will hear things you missed.  My hubby goes sometimes and my daughter goes other times.  Once I had three people on my appt.  A BC survivor, my husband and my daughter.  My doc loved it.  You will need that support trust me. There are many places that you can call locally that you can talk to on the phone or even visit.  We are out here.  You will have your ups and downs.  Your husband will feel helpless.  Your family will feel helpless.  All this is sooo normal. I've been there and sometimes return there.  All very normal.  Don't push yourself.  Spend some good time with family.  Keep informed.  Spend time alone if you need some time alone. But most of all get informed.  You can fight this nasty disease.  Don't spend too much time reading ugly stuff on the internet.  Just keep in mind this is your own journey.  It cannot be replicated by anyone else's journey.  We all are different.  Sorry to ramble, but there are so many great Survivors that so want to support you.  Just let us know and we will be here for you.  Hugs and prays on your trip to fight this ugly thing called cancer!",
