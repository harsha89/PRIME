The chemo nurse told me that because the chemo affects the lining of the digestive tract in a more severe way ie the nausea. It is because the cells here would normally divide rapidly. She said that the mouth sores that some people develop can actually happen lower down in the esophagus and that they are not visible. She said people who develop these usually get chest pain that they may mistake for a heart attack. They last about a week. Maybe this is the case with you. I thought I would share what I was taught. She said to suck on TUMS if that happened.  Take care, Trusting",

People always tell me I look great too and I feel the same way \"who the hell are you kidding\". My efforts to keep fit are going well but for the first time after my last FEC treatment I was EXHAUSTED and actually had to leave my gym class. I agree with you about working. I am still waiiting to hear about my LTD I would assume that you have already gotten your sick leave EI. My daughter is going to university in September and I wish I was at work to help her more financially and have told my husband I may go back during radiation and he has said NOT A CHANCE. You are so right about not working and I think anyone who has to work through this is being made to suffer cruel and unusual punishment. I appreciate you telling how your Docetaxol went and I hope the side effects are less for me too. I have managed my way through FEC but I am getting more fatigue. I am hopeful with the Docetaxol that the SE will be less. I have a lot of the feelings you do Northern Girl and I would like to say to Kity Kat .......Find a way Kity Kat you need to heal and you need to listen to your inner self and your Onc.   Take care, Trusting",

They say 6 out of 7 people will do better with the Docetaxol. Have you asked about Gabapentin? Maybe it is Carbamazepine you mean above or maybe it is Compazine but neither of the drugs make sense for bone or muscle pain to me and that seems to be at the root of your problem and what is getting to you. You need to treat the pain. The Gabapentin definetly makes sense to me and can be very effective.  I think you should ask about Gabapentin. I am an RN and my ongologist said this is what I would have if a muscle,bone pain reaction should occur. It is a very effective killer of nerve related pain. I have often given it when perscribed to patients for bone and muscle pain caused by nerves which is what the Docetaxol is effecting. I hope you are feeling better. Just some suggestions to help and if I can help you I gladly will. Take care, Trusting",

I found that with each treatment the fatigue got worse. FEC SE were gone within the first week though and for the next two weeks after that I found I was almost normal. Make sure with FEC to manage your nausea and do ask for prn nausea medication and the Odansetron. If you feel nauseated use the prn meds too. I wish you well and it sounds like you will be ok. Think positive. I am now on Docetaxol and find that has a whole new set of SE to go with it too. I have 2 more treatments left and they could not be over soon enough. The FEC definetly worked in shrinking my tumor and my lymph nodes. I would listen to your ongologist. Let us face fact NONE of these chemo drugs are a walk in the park and we have no choice. It takes the devil to kill the devil so to say. Take care, Trusting",

Oncologist said from chemo. A little spotting for a couple weeks. Then goes away and comes back. I was not menopausal prior to chemo as I am 45. Anyone else have this? Cause I am like do I have uterine cancer too! I have 2 more Docetaxol treatments to go and I must. I am nervous but I will be completing my treatments if it is the last thing I do.I will see my own oncologist next Tuesday and that is when I am due to have chemo.

It is better to be ER positive as there are more weapons in the arsenol and Tamoxifen is one of them. In fact if you are ER positive Tamoxifen will reduce the risk of spread to the other breast by at least half. I know it gives hot flashes excetra but if it reduces risk of spread with ER positive people that is good. No one likes to take meds but if it can help fight the beast then be glad you can use it.  Take care, Trusting  ",

It is important that we feel good about ourselves after such sufferring. Did you just have 1 side done and did they match the other? I knew about the radiation prior to the flap as my PS (whom I think is wonderful )has already accounted for that. Does a Deip look better than your own breast did and how did the tummy tuck effect turn out?  I do not have enough fat at all for both sides so I will be only able to have 1 side done with Deip reconstruction on the other ( a reduction) to match it. Thanks, Trusting",

I have no SE so far and I continue to pray I do not. I had my first infusion of Docetaxol infusion on Tuesday at 1500hrs and I have 2 more Docetaxol treatments left to go. I had 3 FEC treatments first. I have found the Docetaxol better thus far. You will be fine. I think the uncontrolled pain was at the root of all your problems. You were starting to sound different in your posts.  A friend of mine told me something after the death of her 14 year old daughter and that was she knew at the time she could never let her self get down there because if she did she may never get back up. Remember that cause things could always be worse. Our kids could have cancer and that would be much worse. Keep yourself standing and do not let anxiety and depression become your pathway. I can sense you are strong and will continue to stand and not get down there. Just do not let yourself! It can become a hard cycle to break if you do. How is the Gabapentin working? You are sounding a little more positive . Take care,  Trustiing",

I started with Febrile Neutropenia on Sept 1 and spent 6 days in the hospital and then after that on the 14th had another Docetaxol  tx . Then  low and behold had such abdominal pain from severe constipaation that I am now in the hospital again. I have been here since last Thursday. When I have another bm I will be able to go home. X rays showed I was more shall we say full of poop than anyone they had seen. The unit I am on is fabulous. It is a little 5 bed funded oncology ward and it is just for people like us who have had bad SE with chemo. This unit has been a savior for  me and I wish there where more like it. The hospital is brand new and the RN staff is AMAZING. I am being brought back to life and feeling much stronger. Really it is the job of the oncologist to cure the cancer and they are going to give you as much chemo as they can without killing you. I have my next and my last Docetaxol treatment on Oct 5th and I am thankful that I will be finished because this Docetaxol is kicking my ass much  more than FEC did. I am also seeing my PS next week and my radiation oncologist on the 14th. I will then have either radiation or surgery first depending on whether or not I do  implants for both sides or  a one sided DIEP with reduction to the other side. You cannot radiate a DIEP graft... so there is the difference and implants should be done prior to radiation. I am having immediate reconstruction. I just have to make te one side or two decision. Well that is my story. I hope you are all well and for those of you who have finished chemo ....a big congrats! Now we can stand up walk and move forward to the next phase.  Take care, Trusting                                 ",

I am trying not to worry and I have lots of friends and I am very athletic. I do 9 to 10 hours of hardcore exercise a week. I am worried about my fitness during chemo but I am gonna do it ! I wonder if there are any other fitness buffs out there. I hope the meds I have for nausea will help me. I have looked at Jennifer Griffins on you tube (she is a Fox news reporter with triple negative breast cancer) and she has been on Oprah. Her 11 steps for surviving chemo are very helpful. You can google them and they will come up.I plan to make this journey and look at it as the beginning of my recovery. I will need radiation following and then reconstuction but it is fate that has dealt us this hand and we have to deal with it. A friend once told me after losing her daughter that \"you can never let yourself get down there because you know you may never get back up\". I don't intend to let myself go there. My other girlfriend just bought me the 2 cookbooks Jennifer Griffins recommends and I found that touching and caring. The cookbooks are by Kathy Ratz and on the 11 steps. I am so glad I heard from you and thank you all for the warm welcome to the site. I am hear to support anyone who needs it too. We have to share it helps. Thanks, Trusting",

Extreme fatigue and 2 weeks in the hospital.  Thank God the hospital here had an oncology unit that was AMAZING and in a brand new hospital.They are funded for 5 beds and usually have 10. The unit is for people who are struggling with their chemo and have bad SE. They saved my life and helped me make it through these 3 Docetaxols. How I wish you had a unit like that to have helped you. I had bad thrush and sore mouth too. They gave me something they call Fraser Valley mouth wash or the BC cancer clinic calls it Magic mouth wash. It is a steroid, Benadryl and nystatin all mixed together and it fixed my mouth up twice. You swish and swallow. The pharmacists mix it. I wonder if you could get some. Your journey is similar and now on to decide one side or two. Hard decision. Take care Northern Girl. Trusting ",

I will have each treatment three weeks apart. I heard Docetaxol to be less harsh and the main concerns are neuralgia of the hands and feet, allergic reaction and bone pain. For those of you who have started how have you found it? I have done well with FEC and was able to keep exercising at a high level.I want to be able to do this with Docetaxol and would love for you to share Some of you must be getting Paxitaxol instead. I have Dexamethasone to take two times a day for the day before, the day of and the day after.... it is important for the allergic response not to occur. I will also be getting ice mits to my hands and feet for 15 min prior to and after the infusion. I have heard people find the taxols less harsh with the SE that the FEC or AC On another note have you all had surgery or is anyone out there having chemo first and surgery later? if I have a Deip I only have enough for one side and will have radiation then a Deip. If I decide on bioth sides then I will have implants with radiation later. What have you guys had? Anyone with a Deip out there? Thanks, Trusting",

By the third week I feel pretty much normal. I hope Docetaxol feels the same. I have heard it not to be as bad with the SE as FEC and not as hard on the vein.
