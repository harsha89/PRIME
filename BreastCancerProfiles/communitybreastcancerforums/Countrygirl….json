I can honestly say I know how you feel, as I was diagnosed with IDC when my son was just 4 months old. I see you live in Ohio - so do I. If you aren't already, I encourage you to doctor with either the Stefanie Spielman Center (part of the James at OSU) or the Cleveland Clinic - or at least get a second opinion from one of them. Triple negative doesn't have as many treatment options as other subtypes, but it is still certainly curable. The larger cancer centers will know the most effective way to stop it. You will need lots of help with your little one - treatment is no fun. But, you WILL get through it. Take it one day at a time. It will get better. I promise. Feel free to message me with any other questions. Big hugs to you as you start this journey. It's just not fair",
