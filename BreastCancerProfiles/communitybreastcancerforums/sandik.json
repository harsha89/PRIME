Not that I didn't break down a few times, but the not knowing is bad! My surgery is scheduled for the 13 the. Funny you say about the nook. I bought a Droid tablet. Haha Instead of an email, I made a group on Facebook, added all of my friends that I want to keep updated. After every step, I write a post and they all know what's going on. They also have been posting lots of motivational stuff for me on there.",

First time they found it was in her 60s (this would have been in the 70s). She had the lump removed. Did not need chemo or radiation. She just took pills. Another 4 years went by and she found the other one, on the other breast. She had that one removed. Again no chemo or radiation. Just pills. She had a double masectomy. Not sure if each one came off as she got the tumors removed or if she did it after the second one. She lived another 20 years after that.  I know not everyone's is the same, and mine probaby won't be like hers. But, it makes me feel a little bit better I think.   I head up a group of women who have been doing Girl's Night Out fundraisers. We donate the money to a local organization that helps children with cancer. I contacted the woman in charge of that organization to ask her some names of some good oncologists in the area. ",

I spent the weekend reading and learning, then called him Monday morning. He stayed on the phone with me for about 40 minutes answering every question I threw at him. ",

I was a mess most of today. Got some calls from family members who found out, so each time was a crying mess. haha But, tomorrow is a new day. Hopefully I will have something to keep me busy for most of it. I'm supposed to get a call from the dr who did my biopsy to discuss the next steps. Maybe once I start getting a plan together I won't feel so much like Im spinning my wheels.   Thank you dragonfly for the book reccomendation. I will have to look into it.  ",

Our deductible is $9000, we are at $5000 right now, but co-pays do not count. SOOO glad this came up. I never would have thought about that and I would have been screwed.  We are doing a withdrawl from our 401k, but can only do it once, so if I did it before this it would not have been good!  ",
