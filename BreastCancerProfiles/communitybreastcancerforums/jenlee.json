It now appears that since I have had a good response, we're probably adding two more cycles.   Not loving the idea of adding more chemo, but as long as I'm here in chemo-land anyway, bring it on!     Note: Significant developments for those who were initially lower responders as well.   www.medscape.com/viewarticle/7...  Jenifer, completed TAC x 8 on 4/24/2012.

When I take off my wig in a few months, these wrinkles will be really obvious. I'm REALLY glad I had chemo and had a great response, but I could just cry when I see myself in the mirror. camillegal, I'm still going through products too, but since my diagnosis, have gone mostly organic, which might be part of the problem:). I am going to back to retin A, but I'm wary of it in the summer sun. I wear a hat and sunscreen, but the California sun is sneaky. I had a consultation with a dermatologist and there are several long term solutions, laser ablation, fat transfer, etc., but I don't have any room for that much down time. So for now, it's lotions & potions. Will keep you all posted if I find something.",

As one surgeon joked sarcastically, sure, if the extra two cycles don't kill you. It wasn't a bit fun, but I survived. In the beginning, I was eating normally. Toward the end, I could only tolerate mostly bland foods... Bagels, crackers, etc. A concerned friend sent me a protein shake that was really yummy and was loaded with vitamins and nutrients, so I felt a little less depressed about the lack of nutrition in what i was eating. Neoadjuvant treatment was recommended to me because it gives the doctors the opportunity to see if the tumor is responding to the chemo, and if not, possibly change to another chemo. In my case, I had an excellent response to chemo -- all of the invasive cancer was destroyed by the TAC, leaving behind some DCIS, which isn't affected by chemo anyway. After chemo, I was also given the option of a lumpectomy & rads, but decided that I preferred a mastectomy anyway. Psychologically, you need to adjust your mindset a little with neoadjuvant chemo...in the beginning, I found myself wishing the tumor was gone from my body instead of still there... But I found myself very motivated by those ultrasounds that measured the shrinkage in between cycles. In restrospect, I'm REALLY glad that I did go with neoadjuvant... Having the knowledge that my tumor was so drastically affected by chemo will continue to provide me with long term psychological benefit.",

P.S. - does anyone else check out their hair growth CONSTANTLY?  Even when I'm really busy, I find myself analyzing hair and brows several times a day.  And on a quiet day at home, too many times to count:)  ",

My logic is that if it's working on the tumor, we know it's working on any little nasties that may have broken loose from our breasts and are floating around in our bodies!  I had varying opinions from several MO's & surgeons and choose one who was 100% convinced that adjuvant was the way to go. I'd doing TAC x 8.  It was originally TAX x 6, but my MO changed it based on good results after round 2, at which point we saw approx. 65% shrinkage of tumor  (see study below)...  So I would have been 2/3 of the way done by now (just had # 4 last week), but now I'm only 1/2 done.  I hate it, it sucks and I'm an emotional wreck, but it is working.  My side effects aren't as horrible as some of you have experienced -- the worst ones so far are psyschological.   My MO was really excited about this... German (GeparTrio) study on Neoadjuvant Chemo was released at the 2011 San Antonio Symposium...  Apparently the study showed that if after two rounds of TAC, there was a significant response (50% or more reduction in tumor); they then found that those who were given six more cycles (for a total of eight) had even better outcomes than those receiving four more cycles (for a total of six).  MO is very interested in this and has spoken to the investigators.   Note: Significant developments for those who were initially lower responders as well.   www.medscape.com/viewarticle/7... ",

(And ate at lot of soy protein bars that last year, blah blah blah) I hate myself for not insisting on a biopsy -- so many of you have been smart & assertive enough to demand biopsies.  It never crossed my mind.  Probably would have been just DCIS if daignosed much earlier.",

Edited to say:  ok, just found one of the answers to my questions.  Her mom noticed a pea-size lump.  She was actually diagnosed when she was TWO with a rare form of juvenile breast cancer?   Juvenile breast cancer?  That certainly puts mine at age 50 into a different perspective.  today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4116118... ",
