I went to a breast center and they will give results to me directly. The tech said \"the doctor will review the mammogram and will call if she sees anything that requires further testing\" otherwise they will email me report on Tuesday I guess?",

Doctors usually give results immediately, but she was gone for the day and is off Monday so no results til Tuesday! Ughhhh. The next few days will be hard I asked the tech who I know can't tell me anything, if she saw anything, and she said no. I said so nothing big or scary? And she just said no, but have to let the doctor look as she can see things she can't, just try not to worry. It gave me a twinge of reassurance but not really ! So scared! Log in to post a reply",
