I just renegotiated with my onc to do Xgeva every 6 weeks instead of every 4. That way, it lines up with my TDM-1 that I get every 3 weeks, so I don't have to make extra trips to the cancer center. Of course if there is progression in bone mets, we'll go back to every 4 weeks. I'm 39 and worry about fractures after being on these bone builders over 4 years now. I am trying to be careful about getting lots of calcium and I have a bone density test yearly. Have to say I don't run and have never been a runner, but I know that weight-bearing exercise like walking and running are good for your bones. Maybe you could try doing some alternative activities once in awhile like nordic walking (with poles), treadmill walking on super high incline so you still get those endorphins going, etc. There is a lady at my gym's pool that \"runs\" in the shallow end and tells me it's not as hard on her arthritis. Good for you for keeping up with exercise, which is so great for keeping your body strong, fending off depression, helping with sleep, etc. I am far too lazy and need to get motivated just to get out and walk! I hope you can find a way to keep running without increased fractures. Does surface make a difference? I used to walk at a gym that had a really springy, level track made out of recycled tires or something.",

Your numbers are quite low.  So SUV uptake just shows how active the area is-- how much of the radioactive material went to that spot. It does not necessarily mean cancer-- areas of arthritis or scar tissue or areas healing from radiation will also \"light up\" and have SUV numbers. Because the areas of uptake on your report are a head and a joint, I would think there is a strong possibility for arthritis or just regular bone degeneration that happens in our joints as we age.  Of course, this is why you need your onc to look at the report and interpret it. I'm no doc, but I am hopeful and sending good thoughts your way! ",

About two weeks after my surgery, I had radiating pain from a spot on my chest. I could point to it, and when I saw my surgeon for a check-up she said that was the spot where she had removed muscle from the chest wall. It was annoying, burning pain as the nerves regenerated and it lasted about 10 days. I took percocet at night to sleep, but was also recovering from the full mastectomy so it wasn't just from the chest wall. I've had no problems with it since then. Not to scare anyone, but I had DCIS with micromets. Clear lymph nodes. Two years later, I have a Stage IV recurrence with mets to bones and liver. My lymph nodes are still clear, so it's most likely that my cancer spread through the blood vessels into the chest wall. I'm glad my surgeon had taken that piece out and got the clear margins she wanted. I wish it had been enough. ",

You definitely want to see a breast surgeon-- someone who specializes in surgery on breast tissue. If it is cancer, they'll do a bunch of tests to see how to proceed and you'll have both a breast surgeon and a breast oncologist to help you make those treatment decisions. A breast oncologist is the one who will make decisions about chemotherapy, etc. So your mom's surgeon probably has oncology training specific to ob/gyn surgeries. You could ask him/her because it's possible he/she specializes in women's cancer surgeries and does both breasts and ovaries. The advantage with a breast specialist is that they are totally focused on nothing but breast surgeries-- lumpectomies, mastectomies, etc. Many breast cancer specialty centers have a \"team approach.\" I have a surgeon, and oncologist, and a radiologist who all meet together to discuss my case. The surgeon is fading out now that my mastectomy is done, and the oncologist has moved to the front as we decide about chemo. This site is great-- I also recommend the message boards on the Komen.org website. Karen",

Went straight upstairs to chemo after, which made for a long day. It felt tender, like a bruise, and my neck was stiff for a few days i think because of the position it was in during the procedure. At my cancer center, they do not use powerports for PET/CT injections. The nuclear medicine tech told me that they don't use it because it spreads the radioactive material or dye too fast and they miss things in the chest area that way. I get a PET&CT every 2-3 months and that's the only time I have to do IVs in the arm. Everything else is done through my power port and it's really easy. Mine shows when I wear v-necks and such, but honestly I just don't care. It's never bothered me at all and I have two scars because my first port had to be replaced. About that-- my first port did not heal correctly. The incision split open and then I got a blood infection through the port. This was at the beginning of my cancer journey and I didn't want to whine or be a bother blah blah blah so I waited too long to tell someone. Got ridiculously sick from the blood infection and had to have the port removed and be in the hospital for 6 days with a PICC line in my arm for IV antibiotics for weeks before I got a new port. So, just keep it clean and if it doesn't seem to be healing, be sure to have someone look at it. Infections like the one I got are very, very rare. It still didn't keep me from wanting that port back! ",

Since you are Stage IV, I think you have different needs than women with earlier stage cancers. SCCA is a treatment center that is part of an alliance-- the Fred Hutchinson Research Center, UW Hospital, and SCCA. With metastatic disease, I strongly urge you to go to SCCA where you will have access to more clinical trials and have doctors that are participating in research and conferences, thus up on all the latest treatment protocols. Swedish is an excellent hospital and would give you great care, but us mets gals are really better off in a place with a research component that is emphasized. I often meet people at SCCA who are there from Alaska, Montana, Oregon, etc.-- it is one of the best cancer centers in the country. I'd put it up there with MD Anderson. I can't give you too much advice about where to live, except to tell you that this is a very expensive place to live overall. Renton and Tukwila are outside the city and would be cheaper, or North of the city there is Shoreline and Lynwood, which are cheaper as well. I have a friend that lives in a trailer in Lynwood, but it's a senior park so I think she gets a pretty good deal. You might find that since having Stage IV breast cancer is considered a disability by social security, you could qualify for a senior/disabled trailer park? ",

It also seems to get better as I get up and around more, but sometimes it's too painful to do that! Someone told me to drink a ton of water with lemon, trying to reduce all of the water retention from taxol and the steroids. I don't know if that works or not, but it doesn't hurt to try.  Massages are expensive, but I've found a few mani/pedi places that let me get a pedicure without the cuticle cutting or anything. I just soak my feet, get an extra-long massage, and then they paint my toes. Kinda fun! ",

Please understand that the majority of women here are undergoing treatment for cancer. So it's hard for people to come in here and respond to everyone that is worried but not diagnosed. Generally these people are looking for support that individuals in treatment just don't have to give. There are some wonderful women here (and men) who come into this section and spend lots of time reassuring and helping others. I am thankful for them. I usually find I cannot post on these threads for two reasons, and I bet I'm not alone: 1. I have Stage IV breast cancer which means constant treatment and dealing with death&dying issues. It is selfish, but sometimes when I read some of the threads in this forum they just make me angry. People convinced they have cancer when a doctor has told them the biopsy was benign, people stressing out and worrying when they don't yet have results, people who are just in general in a way better situation than I am. This isn't the case with all posts, of course. But often I just want to scream \"Don't freak out before you have to! Go enjoy a day without a diagnosis hanging over your head!\" I know that's not fair of me, believe me. That's why sometimes it's just easier to not post at all. 2. I think that for many women worried that they might possibly have breast cancer, hearing from a metastatic patient isn't helpful. My story just makes them more scared. I don't even go to the YSC support group any more because I felt the women were all thinking \"I hope what happened to her never happens to me.\" I don't want to create more stress. Please also keep in mind that there are others in your situation and you might find support actually by posting on their threads. I know there is an advantage to hearing from those with lots of experience-- but meeting others who are waiting for results might be helpful, too. You unfortunately are joining BCO right in the middle of this huge forum change and people are struggling to figure out the new design and features. I think a lot of posts are just getting missed. Once things settle down in a few days, hopefully more posts will be getting replies. I sincerely hope you find the support that you need, both here and with your family/friends. ",

You have to take the machine everywhere, it's in a bag you can carry, then when you're in bed or just sitting around you can plug it in to keep it charged. It was not painful for me at all, though a few times when they changed the dressing it would hurt. I had a visiting nurse that came to my home every other day. The dressing change has to be done by a nurse, it only takes about 10 minutes but they'll turn the machine off, take the adhesive cover off, then there is a sponge-like wedge inside the wound that they replace and then cover it all again. The sponge is attached to a tube, so the wound vac machine puts constant suction on that pulls out the bad stuff and helps the wound heal faster. I have very sensitive skin so the adhesive was hard to have on my skin all of the time, it was itchy and I got little blisters. But it has to stay sterile so they continue to cover it with tagaderm or whatever those sticky sheets are. I wish that I had used a skin protectant from the very beginning-- it's worth asking about. Before they put the wound vac dressing on, they can use a skin prep thing that is like a lotion, let it dry then put the adhesive on top. It won't totally protect the skin forever, but it did help and I wish I'd done it from the start (not after I already had blisters). They definitely should give you painkillers that you can take before the dressing change. I was on oxycodone healing from the entire surgery, I would always take one about 20 minutes before the nurse arrived. Having home healthcare was awesome, I don't know if that is an option for you but ask about it!",

I had my mastectomy 10/24 and they did the node mapping the afternoon before. First they injected the breast to numb it up-- just a little bee-sting like feeling. Did you ever have a biopsy? It's the same numbing medication, for some people it burns a little. Then, the radiologist injected 6ccs of radioactive fluid into my breast. It took about 5 injections around the nipple. I was so surprised that I could not feel a thing-- there was no pain for me at all. The radiologist said that most people do not feel any pain, some do feel burning while getting the injections. The weird part is that the fluid makes the breast all lumpy and squishy. I had to walk around the hallway for an hour, swinging my arm and massaging the breast to get the radioactive material to work its way through the tissue. None of this hurt. After an hour, they took some pictures with a big machine (I just had to lay on a table). They used permanent marker to mark my skin where the first 4 nodes were. Then they put some waterpoof tape over the markings so that I could do my pre-surgery scrub without washing off the markings. That's it-- then I was on my way home. Seriously, I was so nervous about the pain that I threw up on my way to the hospital. But I felt NOTHING other than the sting of the ladacane(sp?) for a few seconds. Since then I've found that most women don't have pain. Some do, though, so you read those stories and it freaks you out. I hope this helps you! Tell the radiologist doing the injections your fears and he/she will talk you through the procedure. I found it easier than both biopsies I'd been through. I'm disappointed your doctor told you it would be painful-- I think they do that just in case, so they can hear you say \"it wasn't so bad.\" They'd rather have you expect something bad and be happy it wasn't.",

Tykerb and Herceptin together gave me about 4 months of stability that I hadn't expected, I was scheduled to take Tykerb&Xeloda together but we were holding off on the Xeloda a few weeks so I could heal from an ooph. Lo and behold, markers went down so we went with that a few months. So now I'm on Herceptin, Xgeva, Tykerb, and Xeloda. Xeloda is a chemo and there are several threads about it here. It has it's own side effects, but most women do not lose their hair. There are some others that are simiar-- easier chemos, less harsh, more focused on keeping a good quality of life so you can stay on the drugs a long time. I've been on Xeloda a year now and it seems that I might be looking at another change after my next scans. But overall, I've had a good quality of life for the past year. I guess my point is that even if you need to start chemo, it doesn't have to be as bad as the first one you did when they were really trying to hit the cancer hard. They might be able to come up with a combo of drugs that lets you keep up some energy to chase a kid! ",

They aren't disappearing, but they aren't growing and I have a good quality of life. I don't notice in particular having a dryer mouth, have had no platelet problems at  all. I do have low potassium and sodium now, but not sure that is from the drug.",

I've had a dvt and a pulmonary embolism, was on fragmin injections for about 6 months, then warfarin ever since. I was never taken off chemo during this time. My doctor explained that over time, chemotherapy damages blood cells. I also now have amenia and it's not from not getting enough iron, it's that my blood just can't store it the way it used to. So, blood clots are not unique to just tamoxifen treatment. If the tamoxifen was working for you friend, it would think it possible to go back as long as she was on blood thinners. However, once they shut her ovaries down with faslodex she would be taking drugs for post-menopausal women (tamoxifen is generally for pre-menopausal women).  I would question why her doctor is taking her off Tamoxifen while she is taking warfarin. Is there some kind of drug interaction? Most cancer patients who have had a DVT or PE stay on warfarin forever. If I were her, I would not want to be off Tamoxifen or any cancer treatment for 6 months, that seems like a long break. But if she brings it up with her doc, I'm sure there is a good explanation? or if not, she might want a second opinion. Karen",

I get them every 2-4 months, depending on how I'm responding to treatments, so I've had a lot of them. It's probably a little different at different facilities, but this is my experience. I do a PET/CT scan combo, so have to drink the barium stuff. You may not have to do that. When I arrive at the center they put me in my own room. I should mention that for prep i can have only water 12 hours before the test. No exercise for 48 hours before. They used to ask me to do a low carb/high protein diet the day before, but they no longer do that. Anyway, first thing is they put in an IV. I have a power port, but they don't use it for PETs, something about the speed of the tracer. I start to drink the barium and they take some vials of blood and they check my glucose level. Then, a tech from nuclear medicine comes in and injects a radioactive tracer through the IV. It is not at all painful. Then, I have to stay completely still in the reclining chair for 45 minutes. They don't even want me to read because they don't want eye movements picking up tracer. I can listen to music on my ipod. I find it very, very boring. When they come get me to walk me back to the machine, I stop off to pee because they want your bladder empty so they can see everything better. I lay on the narrow table with my hands above my head. It's like a donut around the table, not fully enclosed like an MRI. I don't have any anxiety or claustrophobia about the machine, while an MRI makes me very anxious. The scan takes about 30-40 minutes total, I just have to stay still. The table moves back and forth through the donut. It makes a whirring sound, but not loud banging like an MRI. The last few minutes of my scan, they inject a contrast through the IV and do the CT part-- it's the same machine. Because some people have allergic reactions to that contrast, they ask me to stay in the waiting area 15-20 minutes after the scan to make sure I don't show any signs of that. They have juice and snacks, which are nice after fasting for so long. That's it-- there is nothing painful other than getting the IV put in. I usually take ativan before I go in now just because I do these tests so often and I find it so tedious to be still for so long. Sometimes I'm more relaxed than others-- if we suspect a chemo has stopped working and I have progression, I am more anxious and find it awful to lay in that chair and then on that table without any real distraction. Sometimes I have discomfort like back pain for laying on that table so long-- ask for a pillow for under your knees and anything else you think might help with that. My PET scans are sent to the radiologist, who usually takes about a day to get the report to my onc. I meet with her 1-2 days after my scan to get results. The scan will show areas of \"uptake\" which can indicate several things, but a good radiologist should be able to tell if any of these are areas they think are mets. My PET scans show mets in my bones and liver. It will pick up other things-- fibroids in my uterus, gigivitis in my gums, etc. I know how nerve-wracking this testing can be. But PET scans are really good-- super expensive, so many people have to rely on just CTs.  Sounds like your new surgeon is giving you excellent care. I hope you get great results and that they can find an easy way to releive your pain.",

This is what freaks me out-- my tumor markers were up in a crazy way (one that is supposed to be 0-37 was above 1500). The lymph nodes under my right arm (side of mastectomy) we a little enlarged. So they did a biopsy on them, and it was clean. The radiologist sent me home, oh you're fine! My oncologist didn't feel good about those tumor marker numbers, which had always been in normal limits for me before, so she fought my insurance company to get be a bone scan. Numerous mets on that scan got them to approve a PET scan. I keep thinking about leaving the cancer center after that biopsy, thinking everything was fine. How much longer might the cancer have spread through my body before it was found? If my onc hadn't trusted her instincts and fought for that scan, it could have gotten a lot worse before I got into treatment. I didn't have any symptoms besides fatigue. And I had just started a new job that had me traveling Mon-Fri, so who wouldn't attribute fatigue to that? I feel very lucky to have caught this. Even catching it sooner rather than later, I had bone mets on 17 different sites and more than 10 mets in my liver, some as large as 4cm and 5cm.

I have not had any regression, still bone mets and mets to liver, but everything has held stable and that's good enough for me. I did get a brain met during the last year, but gamma knife zapped it. The side effects of TDM-1 have continued to lessen with every round. I now have significant fatigue the weekend after infusion, achiness and no appetite, but that's about it. Cburke you should ask your doctor again about continuing Herceptin. Kadcycla is a chemo bound to Herceptin, so it's not typical to continue Herceptin during this treatment-- you are already getting it within Kadcycla. Hope this drug works great for you! Karen",

But there are lots of women that do the fertility treatments before/after chemo and I know there are discussions about it in other areas of these boards. They can probably give you some advice and insight, though your oncologist will know what is best for your specific situation. Lots of gals here in the Stage IV forum are raising kids, though, so I'm sure some will chime in about the challenges of doing that during treatment (there is no \"after treatments\" for us). I only have fur babies. You might also check on the boards for the YSC, lots of women there under 40 thus maybe more folks in your situation with experience having kids while dealing with mets. Good luck to you!",

Not to scare you about that, it was very rare. But just so I can tell you that i continue to be treated at SCCA and feel very lucky about that. I don't know what you age is, but I found a lot of support through the Young Survivor Coalition. They have a support group that meets at Gilda's House on Capitol Hill every other week. Generally, it's women diagnosed before they were 40, but the ages really do range from about 25-50.  It's a fun group of women and you'd get lots of support and information. ",

Having radiation was something only for lumpectomies-- if they took the whole breast, there was no indication of benefit from radiation. Now, this standard may have changed over the past few years, but I have not heard that. Also, I live in the US-- maybe radiation is not standard here, but is in other countries? ",

But others can have opinions here and express them here and it's really not your place to tell them to go elsewhere. If you'd like to have a discussion about DCIS in that forum, please do so. But the OP posted a valid question here and I am stage IV and have no problem discussing it here. The only thing that makes me uncomfortable is how at times your posts set a tone that you are right about everything and the rest of us are wrong. I just don't think it's that simple. I'm sure you feel you are always in the right. So fine, write what you want, but let the rest of us continue our discussion. My 2mm of IDC that was found in a first biopsy was never seen again-- and the pathologist sliced frozen sections of my entire breast three different times because they were so concerned that they were missing something after my mastectomy. My breast surgeon and my oncologists, both at UW and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, agreed along with the rest of my tumor board team that I was Stage 0. If the microinvasion (which they called it, not a stage 1 tumor) had been in a lymph node they would have felt differently, i'm sure. But because it was placed in the middle of 9cm of DCIS, no one on the team thought it was possible that it was IDC that could have spread. They still considered my cancer a non-invasive stage 0. You can argue about this and tell me that my doctors and I are wrong. I trust them and if you disagree or if there are other ways to describe this now, that's just fine. I'm talking about MY EXPERIENCE here. And MY EXPERIENCE was that in 2007 I had a mastectomy and was told it was all DCIS, the biopsy IDC would be considered a microinvasion, that I was Stage 0 and would be put on tamoixfen for 5 years. My oncologist is Dr. Julie Gralow and I quite literally put my life in her hands. She is not stupid and neither am I. I understand the staging of breast cancer, and my team had reasons for making the decision that mine was a stage 0 cancer and not a stage 1. You write, \"For all of the DCIS women who've popped into this thread, you are getting frightened for no reason.\"    I disagree.  I think it was pure luck that my biopsy caught that spot and if it hadn't, we would never have known about it. I think there are women out there that are told they have pure DCIS, and in rare cases they later have mets. There is no reason for women to be frightened, but if what they take away from my story is to keep vigilant and keep going for your mammograms and MRIs, then I think that's great.",

It's so rare and random for this to happen, please don't let it worry you so much that it makes you miserable. I was never concerned about recurrence, really was not at all in my mind. But I am glad that I was vigilant about keeping up with my follow-up care, taking my tamoxifen and going to appointments. And because I was only 33 at diagnosis, I do think my doctors followed me more closely. My DCIS was grade 3 and triple positive, and combined with a young age it did indicate a more aggressive cancer. Anyway, thanks to everyone for the support. The info about radiation is interesting-- if I were diagnosed today, I might have been offered radiation as an option. But I never go back and second-guess my original treatments. I have a world-class oncologist and an awesome cancer center and I know that we made the best decisions we could at the time with the info given.

Two years later I had a recurrence. There is still no cancer in the other breast or in my lymph nodes. But there were mets all over in my bones and my liver. My onc believes that my cancer must have spread through the blood vessels in the chest wall, since it's still not in the nodes. The doctors all still shake their heads, wondering how in the world this happened. But it did. So when I was diagnosed stage IV in Oct 2010, that was my first time facing chemo.

It's still a bit controversial-- some people can have terrible cancer through their bodies and their markers are fine. There are many oncologists who do not check markers because they don't believe they are accurate in enough women to make it worth doing-- many docs think they cause unnecessary worry. In my particular case, tumor markers have be very accurate at showing cancer progression. I could have these a little wrong but there are 2 we check, the CA 27-29 and the CEA. I can't remember which is which. . . one is supposed to be 0-37, another one is supposed to be 0-5. Mine were something like 1560 and 210 when first diagnosed with mets. We've tracked them through all my treatments and they go down when chemo is working, they raise when my cancer progresses. I feel very lucky to have these quick, easy little blood tests that give me a little window into how things are going. If you do a search on these boards, you'll find other discussions about tumor markers-- good and bad. But something to ask your oncologist about, for sure. ",
