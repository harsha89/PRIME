I was just getting my life back to normal when a couple of days ago I discoverd a hard lump in my groin, I think it's a node. Has anyone else had this? The lump is about the size of the top of my finger, is hard and feels painful when I press on it. I'm terrified that it's mets. I would appreciate any input. Thank you for always being there.
