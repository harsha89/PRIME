Went to my primary care doc this morning and she ordered a breast MRI, so now all I have to do is schedule the appt. I figure if there is something there that I am feeling, then I will know for sure :) good luck Hun",

Tomorrow might be a Ikea trip and then that leaves us Wednesday, going to enjoy the kiddos. I try not to worry about this lump, but sometimes I think I might have felt it a couple of months back, or was that just a dream? I guess the fact that I have one radiologist saying birad 4 and another saying birad 1 has me really confused. Going with the first as the quality of care was very personable and caring. Radiology dept two, a whole different story :( Good luck and \"happy\" waiting",

I have some questions for those who have had a ultra sound guided biopsy. 1. Does it hurt? 2. Will the doctor be able to tell if it is just \"fat\" by looking at sample? 3. Will the doctor be able to know by the way it \"feels\", pushing the needle through? Is cancer hard or squishy? Just trying to prep myself for the outcome, hopefully all will be ok in the end :) Log in to post a reply",

It had a small sinking or pitted look to it. Checked it and there was a firm lump that was easily touched. Now, three days ago I noticed a lump in my left breast about 2-3 inches above aereola, this one is deeper tho. Will they check both breast or just the initial lump? Also, edn though the pitted appearance is still there, the lump is not as accessible as before. It seems to have gotten smaller??? Any advice is appreciated :) Log in to post a reply",
