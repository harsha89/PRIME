She's having an appointment with the surgeon next week in any case, as she needs to got though options. It can't be good to have continual biosises and lumpectomies not to mention the anxiety...would love any advice on the options. She's been told she should have her ovaries out (she's 54) - which she is planning. Mastectomy is obviously a big decision...have read quite a few posts on here about recurrence post mastectomy so not sure what to think. Also the new surgeon, was surprised by how much tissue had been removed during the last lumpectomy and suggests plastic surgery. So that's where we are...thank you and good luck to all, SydSyd",

      "Content": "SydSyd wrote: Hello - I am writing for my sister who was diagnosed in 2011 with DCIS in the right lower breast and had a successful lumpectomy and radiation. She's been having regular screenings since...her MRI on Friday found what is described as: \" 6 mm lesion nodular demonstrates suspicious enhancement kinetics\" in the upper right breast. She had a second-look ultrasound today and the lesion did not show up. The radiologist suggested she s speak with person who read the initial MRI. Would love to know more about her options. Her surgeon suggests an MRI-guided biopsy. She's already had 2 lumpectomies and 3 biopsies of that breast and really wonders if another biopsy is needed. First - is a biopsy really needed? (she's been told yes - small can be lethal too) Second - if it is so small - does it not make sense to remove it entirely and then biopsy it ... Third - If so, what re the surgical options for removal...what about MRI breast biopsy and ablation? Thanks for your thoughts and best to all! Log in to post a reply",
