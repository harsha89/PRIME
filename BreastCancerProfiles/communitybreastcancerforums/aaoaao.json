Another example of my humor is when a phone salesperson kept trying to sign me to a 2 year contract after I said no several times..I asked him what the reception was like in a box 6 feet under.  Sorry dude I just couldn't stop myself.",

Second, the flu's most severe side effects usually subside after 24 hours.  I never know when or if I'll ever feel normal again.  I usually don't say nothing to them because they probably mean well and they're just naive.  I guess people saying rude or ignorant things to us is just another part of having cancer.",

I have quite a few relatives who live in Brooklyn, New York and not one ever had cancer.  One of the few direct causal links between smoking and lung cancer still doesn't explain why some people can smoke and not get cancer and others who never smoked get cancer.  I'm just skeptical when someone claims to know what causes cancer.  Cancer isn't one disease but many.  It is my opinion that people trying to blame one thing or another, without have adequate research to back it up, is looking for either a scapegoat or an angle from which to profit from. As for companies trying to profit off of medications, yes, some do charge outrageous fees.  However, there is a high cost and extensive time in trying to bring a drug to market.  There has to be some financial incentive for these companies to develop meds that will either extend or save lives.  They're not nonprofits.  The means to the end is what counts in the final analysis.  We need new drugs to solve many medical problems, cancer being only one of them.  If we beat down our drug developing companies by preventing them from profiting or by extensive bad publicity making investors wary, we are shooting ourselves in the foot to some degree.  Regulations are needed and many are already in place, but they shouldn't become so restrictive that they prevent life saving treatments from being available. Again, these are just my opinions.  I just try to remember that people have been running around for centuries trying to blame one thing or another for cancer.  If anyone wants a good history of cancer, read the book \"The Emperor of all Maladies\".",

After all, we won't be just seeing them on an occasional basis, we will be in their care for the rest of our lives. Most take our lives in their hands and do their very best to help us achieve the longest, pain-free lives possible.

So to see them attacked as puppets and unintelligent really riles me up. The human body, and cancer itself, is very unpredictable and to expect doctors to be able to fix us like a mechanic fixes a car is just stupid.

Just because I made a decision other than the one you made doesn't mean I'm an idiot who is led like a lamb to the slaughter. Your \"I'm superior to you\" attitude is disgusting and smug. By the way, many healthy, diet conscious people get cancer too. Stress also doesn't cause cancer or it would be killing out military, police and firefighters in mass. As for the research you did, how do you know the methods you selected work better than others? Studies, statistics, some personal stories? I guess their methods are perfect and without any bias. Also when you cut your finger, you might still need to get it stitched..which also has been done for hundreds of years. Just because something has been done for a long time doesn't mean it isn't the right way. Maybe YOU need to keep an open mind. As for your method being successful for you.. only time will tell. Or maybe you have a way of examining EVERY cell in your body. Also dear, microwaving your finger wouldn't be draconian...you are aware that microwaves were invented that far back?",

However, to say that the all doctors or even the majority of them don't care or are profit mongers is a cruel sterotype. People who do this would claim that they're fair and don't try to peg people based on rumor or an experience with one doctor. Most doctors want to help make their patients well and if they're at risk of dying will do whatever they can to save that patient. Some people might say that they're being too aggressive at times but your life is in their hands and they also feel a sense of responsibility. If you don't like the options your doctor gives you then discuss it with them. They might actually have a very good reason for the treatment they chose. Remember they know the risks and have seen what can happen under various scenarios. I'd like to remind people to give doctors the benefit of the doubt before assuming they don't care, don't know, or just want to get money. Finally, if you still don't trust your doctor and his treatment plans, find another one. Sticking with a doctor you feel like you need to second guess all the time adds additional stress that isn't needed. I hope that all treatment plans work, whatever they may be.",

We, as Stage IVers often form very close and CARING relationships with our doctors. She was pretty much as offensive as it gets. Then, instead of realizing how rude she was and offering an apology, she continued to assume that we didn't do the research and that our doctors (our medical field in general) don't have the skills to cure diseases. I'd give her a break if she'd at least acknowledge that she was extremely rude, insensitive and naive (but apparently she doesn't feel that she was). A simple apology would go a long way or at least a statement that would illustrate that she didn't still assume that the path we've chosen isn't the path straight to the morgue...it's apparent that she still doesn't respect our choices but wants us to respect hers. Again, if you ever get in my shoes (and I wish that you never do), you'll probably understand how we feel when someone with a low-stage dx and less than 6 months of dealing with it, arrogantly preaches how our treatments are not only stupid but draconian (her exact words). I'm also very concerned about the mis-information she stated as fact. Instead of asking me to give her a break (if she deserved one I'd give it), you might want to ask her to show REAL understanding of how RUDE and WRONG she was. Our treatment decisions are often a matter of immediate life and death and they're extremely vital to us and our very existence, you just don't rudely knock that and refuse to apologize. So sorry I don't agree with you but that's how I feel. I would politely ask lower stage bc patients to remember that their cancer, more likely than not, is curable. Ours is not, we will most likely die from this disease and will forever be undergoing the treatments that you can't wait to end. I can understand more how you feel because I was once there but you will never fully understand my position unless you get where I'm at. When I post responses to people not Stage IV, I try to give them honest, caring answers without scaring them. All I'm asking for is a little sensitivity back.",

Some doctors want to prescribe drugs to treat our \"mental\" disorders while ignoring the cause of what's behind these issues. Again..if I'm not sleeping because I have a lump in my arm, don't just give me drugs, find out WHY I have a lump in my arm. Don't get me wrong because drugs for sleep and anxiety are sometimes necessary to get us through our days. I readily admit I'm bipolar and take meds for it. I denied it for many years due to being embarrassed and in denial. I just think that it helps if doctors try to help resolve issues than CAN be resolved. I don't believe that most doctors don't care, I just don't think they sometimes don't understand how much we are really worried. So that is why I'd advise stating it clearly to them...I want to do something because I NEED to. If they still can't understand, then they're an insensitive clod and a new doctor is in order.",

No one should have to worry about something if a test can be done to help resolve the situation. It seems to always be about the money...who is going to pay for it.

The reality is no matter how long we live, it's a life that is vastly different from the way others live. There are very few diseases, can't even think of any right now, that requires the level of medical treatment that we have to undergo for the remainder of our lives. Chemo, rads, hormonals, surgery, the list goes on and on. Basically, there isn't a form of medical intervention that we don't get hit with. We often have to beg, when other forms of treatment have been exhausted, to get on a clinical trial that will buy us even a little more time. Again, I can't think of any other diseases that have to deal with this reality. That's the bad side. The good side is that we, at least most of us, learn to value life more. We make more of an effort to re-examine our lives and make changes to live it to its fullest. Most also reaffirm their relationships with people who love and support us and cut out the people who don't. I've actually made sweeping changes in my life based on living a quality life not a quantity life. The truth is we will die earlier than we normally would have and we will be fighting every day for those precious days. So whether it's 3 years, 13 years or 23 years (the dream of most of us), we have been changed for good and for bad. Wishing love and much quality time for all of us.",

The procedure for the port placement for me was very easy.  I was unconscious the whole time.  The healing process was easy and with very little pain.  Yes there is a small incision scar and a little bump where the port is.  However, I'd rather have that then the bruising up and down the arm that IVs leave behind.  Plus my ONC said some of the chemo drugs can cause vein damage.  Of course, everyone should consider their own needs/concerns and do what is best for them.  I just wanted to let people know that most port placements don't cause dangerous side effects. As for chemo...I don't see it as the enemy but my friend in this fight against cancer.  I will be on chemo, off and on, for the rest of my life.  BUT IF IT KEEPS ME ALIVE I'LL STICK WITH IT.  Yes it makes you ill at times and can be hard on the body but Cancer kills.  The main problems I have with chemo is fatigue (usually hits the 2nd and 3rd day after infusion), constipation and hair loss.  My regular doctor thought I would lose a lot of weight on chemo but the anti-nausea meds keep my appetite pretty well intact.  The only time I don't feel like eating is the couple of days each week I get very fatigued.  I probably make up for it on the other days.  I hope all here get through their chemo treatments with ease and never have to experience this again.  God bless all of you.",

The past two weeks I not only had to deal with my bald head but also with a scalp infection.  So I looked like an ostrich with a rash.  Prickly liitle hairs and red, swollen, pus filled bumps all over my scalp, sideburn areas, and upper neck.  Where ever there was a hair follicle there was a bump.  Talk about not wanting to go anywhere looking like that.  Normally I'm not too embarassed about my bald head but I looked gross and didn't want to make people SICK looking at me.  It's only now starting to clear up, after scrubbing my head up to 8 times a day and applying an antibiotic.  Just a few bumps here and there now. As a Stage IVer, I would recommend fighting cancer aggressively if at all possible.  Yes very few cancers return but when they do they are fatal at some point.  I will be on cancer treatment for the rest of my life and I will die from it eventually.  The only way cancer won't kill me is to be hit by a bus or some other freak accident.  I will continue to fight this cancer for as long as I can and pray for better treatment that will give long term results or even a cure.  Hey hope springs eternal.  The first time around I thought I fought aggressively but looking back maybe I should have pushed for radiation on my lymph nodes since one had a small tumor in it.  I was told the chemo should kill off any cells left after tumor removal and my other nodes LOOKED clear.  I didn't do any rads.  Of course, the cancer could have returned regardless.  You just never know for sure.  I say give yourself all the options available to stop this disease in its tracks and then if it does come back you know you did all you could to stop it.  I don't have regrets because I know I did the best I knew how to do at the time. I have good days and bad days but for the most part I'm certain that I can survive for a long time.  I don't have a timeline from God for my life so I'm taking one day at a time and have faith that he'll let me know when it's my time to go.  I've been tolerating the chemo drugs pretty well. No real pain just fatigue and constipation.  No real appetite at times (food doesn't taste great) and I get full pretty easily.  I'm fat...okay I'm obese...so this really isn't a problem.  I don't mind admitting this because God designed us all differently and the fat acts like a resource..lol..for when I can't eat much.  Hang in there folks and try to pamper yourself when you can.  Try to eat what you want, sleep when you want, and definitely vent when you need to.  I know this is hard for some people with commitments that can't be pushed off, but try to find help where ever you can.  In some communities the American Cancer Society provides some assistance with housework and other resources.  Please avail yourself to whatever they offer that might help you.  Also if someone says something to you that is insensitive or darn right cruel, try to ignore it because you can't stop stupid.  Use it to make yourself stronger.  If you feel like you have to respond, remind them that cancer can happen to ANYONE and how would they feel if they were in your position.  You could be their mother, sister, wife or even child.  That usually shuts them up. Man this is a long post.  I guess I'm a little hyper today.  I'm on my week off of treatment so I flying high.  Wishing you all the best.",

Rambo, please don't blame yourself for being BRCA positive.  It isn't anything you did and nothing you can do to stop it.  It is good that your daughter knows about it because then she can keep an early watch, early mammos and such, to catch any changes before they become life threatening.  Sorry that your numbers are in the toilet.  Is your ONC going to delay the chemo treatments in order to let your WBCs improve?  My ONC won't let me have any chemo if the WBCs tank.  They get low at times but never down to the level you're at.  Sending best wishes your way that things improve for you. ",

I'm sure that are many more things I'm grateful for that I'm forgetting right now.  I wish everyone here much peace and happiness too.  Life is just too short to waste focusing on the negative.",

I also try to be careful when posting to other threads, not limited to Stage IV, because I know that I'm a reminder to them that cancer can come back. I don't want to scare the heck out of them. Cancer is such an emotional disease that varies from person to person, so where one person might find a statement encouraging others might find it upsetting. I try to remind myself that most people don't want to be hurtful and that we all are here with our own emotional makeup. Also...some of the meds we're on doesn't exactly make us rational at times. There are days when I'm such an emotional wreck that I should probably be quarantine from any form of personal interactions.",

You deserve to be as comfortable as possible and anything they can do to help you get there they should do. Mellie, please don't worry that my initial cancer is similar to yours. Most people with your stage and form doesn't have a reoccurance.  Cancer occurance is a crap shoot and so is cancer reoccurance.  Most people, I believe the statistic is less than 20%, don't have their cancer come back.  I wouldn't spend to much time worrying about that (though I know that is easier said than done), because you have enough on your plate right now.  Just keep trying to remind yourself that you'll be a cancer SURVIVOR not a cancer victim. I don't know much about cold caps, Brian Joseph, wigs or IBS.  My burden is constipation.  I initially, during my first battle, worried about hair loss.  Now I really don't care.  It is what it and others can like it or not.  That's their problem not mine. Also to all, some people do experience treatments differently.  None of us are identical.  So if you have more pain or nausea please don't feel like you're being a baby because you're not.  Some people can work through it and some can't.  Again, it's a crap shoot.  If you need help, get it.  If you need time to heal, take it.  I know this is hard for some due to family/job issues.  I was lucky that I don't have small children or a job that I couldn't take a break from.  For those that have those extra concerns, try to lean on people as much as you can.  It doesn't make you weak but strong because you're building up the weapons you need to win this fight.",

He makes sure to visit his grandparents at least weekly.  He acts as a role model for his younger half-brother.  He is deeply religious and believes God gives us the best principles to live by.  He is a hard worker and very intelligent.  At the young age of 19 he opened his own business and continues to open and run successful businesses.  He is a son any mother would be proud of.  At 26, he has his own place and is dating a beautiful sweet girl.  He plans to marry her and have children but isn't rushing because he wants to be sure of his ability to financially support them and have the time to be a great father.  I guess you can tell I really love my son and I have no doubt he loves me just as much.",

I say if you need rest and can take off work, do it.  Some people say they prefer to work when they can because it takes their mind off of the cancer.  I think each individual should determine what their needs are and follow through.  I know 2 days after infusion I'm pretty useless due to fatigue.  I told all my friends and family that that day is off limits for most activities. I say you need to heal now to be there in the future and that isn't selfish it's reality.  My family wants me here for a long time so they're willing to give me what I need to make that possible.  It's your fight so use whatever weapons you need to in order to win.",

Even aggressive cancers don't usually change that quickly. If waiting until then will drive you crazy, then go for a sooner appointment. I just wanted to reassure you that from a physical standpoint waiting won't cause a bigger issue. Hopefully all will go well.",

At first it felt like a death sentence, but with time things do get easier. I agree with what some others have said...many people live for many years with bone mets. There is a thread here in the Stage IV section for people with bone mets. You will get a lot of support here. I've gotten so much information and they made me realize you can live with bone mets.",

The reason I was told was for some women they aren't reliable and for early stagers they usually don't show much since markers measure proteins that cancer sheds off in the blood stream. So if you don't have mets, there usually isn't a large amount to be found. Most ONCs wait until you become symptomatic to run scans and markers. Your climb in markers should be checked but they aren't horribly high. Other things can make markers rise too. I wish you the best..I would tell you not to worry too much because it won't help but we're human and we can't help but to worry.",
