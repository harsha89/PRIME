They biopsied the lymph node, and it was benign, but in the process of having all the scans, they discovered a new (I've had others) lump in my left breast. I'm going for a biopsy on Tuesday. Swollen/painful lymph nodes can be caused by a lot of things, not just breast cancer. My advice: don't worry until someone tells you that you have something to worry about. My doctor thinks mine was caused by an infection somewhere else in my body. Keep your chin up! :-) Jules",
