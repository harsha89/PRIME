Had same problem about 4 years ago, had an ultrasound, everything was fine doctor prescribed vit b12. So I thought this must be the same thing. Had ultrasound before Christmas after new year found out that i'm pregnant with our 3rd child. The next day the doctor tells me that there is a lump but in my right breast and that I need a biopsy. Had then test yesterday(couldn't get one earlier) and now  the constant \"what if\" is driving me crazy. Have to wait till Thursday for the results. Don't know how i'm going to survive this time (: Log in to post a reply",
