I went through and read a lot of comments inbox about it and just feel that it is not for me. I think I will take my chances. I will most likely be taking tamoxifen as well. SHElabela I was told by the radiologist when I met with her a couple of months ago that they would basically be radiating in the chest & clavicle area because there are lymph nodes there and those are not being tested or removed by surgery. She told me they do that just in case the cancer spread up instead of the direction of the armpit. ",

Having to make all of these decisions when we sometimes just dont know what to do is what frustrates me the most. I still have to meet with my surgeon and then my radiologist next week before I make my decision I'm doing radiation. I also still have four drains in because my PS would not remove any this week even though they were only producing 5 to 10 ML :( I meet with him Tuesday so hopefully he will take at least two of the strains out. It makes it so difficult to get around and take a shower. I am still having to take pain pills at least once or twice a day. I also get the stabbing pains in my chest and I have such tightness around the top of my breast area and then stabbing pains under my arm almost where the drain is. How are the rest of you doing that have just had surgery? I feel like we all deserve a major vacation when we are all done with our treatments!!! Best wishes to all of you ladies! Hugs!!",

I met with my PS this morning. He said he will not remove any drains until next week and then will remove two and then he would remove the other to the following week. That is his usual plan with all patients. Our appt was all of 5 min! Then when I went to make an appointment for next week at the front desk they said he was not available until the 14th. I told them he wanted me back next week to remove two drains and I said well he's not available until the 14th. Needless to say I was very frustrated when I left. So now I know I will have these drains until at least the 21st most likely. No fun! I have my appt at 4 today to hopefully find out if I will need radiation or not. Praying that I won't.

It hurts the most when I get up - the pressure is brutal. Snowfall I am sorry about your path results & its good you will talk to your oncologist in more detail. I discussed my path results again today with my surgeon & she agrees with my oncologist that I need radiation. She said to meet with the radiologist to get more info before I decide...which I plan on. It is just a tough decision! my tumor was 7.5 instead of 3.5 and was not completely gone from chemo although they did say they got it all out from doing the BMX so technically now i am in the clear. But they recommend radiation as another precaution for no reoccurrence. I know some of you have all heard this with your own cases as well. For me if i do rads then my PS would remove my expanders (I would prob remove both sides) then be flat during rads (which is fine). But then I would have to do the DIEP flap to reconstruct & I REALLY dont want to do that surgery. My PS said he cannot use radiated skin for the implants. I am just really torn and upset because we really thought I would not have to do radiation & I was hoping I wouldn't have to make that decision. My dr said I have been so aggressive doing chemo & then BMX that she feels i should continue being aggressive and do rads. I am just TIRED & ready for this to be done so I can move on with my life. I feel like I have been in a fog since my diagnosis in Dec :( not sure I can handle another 6 plus months and that other surgery. Has any of your PS told you that they cannot do implants after rads",

I did not want to start it and then have to stop for surgery & get back on it again after. I enjoy reading these blogs & seeing how everyone is doing. I still ache so much especially in my lower back, hips and legs from chemo. Trying to manage it with that cream that starts with an A (my brain cannot think of it lol) and it helps. Hugs to all!",

That is a huge step :) I was so happy to be done with chemo when I finished. It is so tough on our bodies. I am still pretty tired from it and my body aches at times. You will be SOOOO happy to get those hard TE's out in March :)",

I got the neulasta shot on Thurs and have been very achy, foggy headed and just feel like crap every since. I attempted to go to work Friday and today but I only made it half days. I wanted to ask what your experiences were with AC if you also had taxol first? I got back on May 17th for my 2nd dose of AC and go bi-weekly until June 14th and then I am DONE!! The hardest thing with taxol was the fatigue, but I am finding the AC has definitely kicked my butt and I am wondering when/if I will feel better before my next dose. I know we are all different but hearing other experiences will help me get to the finish line! Thanks so much!

I had my AC last Weds, Neulasta on Thurs and was down pretty much Friday afternoon through today (Tuesday). I thought I was doing better then last night I had chills and was freezing for a couple of hours, I could not get warm. I ran a low grade fever. Then of course the hot flashes hit and then I got a sever headache. I FINALLY feel more human now and hope that I will continue to feel well until my next chemo next Weds (in a week). We shall see. I just keep telling myself I ONLY have 3 left..I have been doing this for 14 weeks!!! I can do it... I had a sonogram 2 weeks ago and it showed my mass has shrunk to half the size. It also showed my lymph nodes all looked normal, where before they did not. That was a blessing. I am scheduled to have a double mastectomy July 11th. I chose to do this because I do not want to ever have to worry or go through this again. Since I am only 41, the doctors recommended it as well. I will not know about radiation until surgery when they test the sentinel lymph node. If it is negative, they will put in expanders and then we wait a week to find out what the pathology report is. If it is negative, we will do reconstruction in about 4-6 weeks. Then all this will hopefully be over :) that is my prayer. I wish you all the best as well. It is so great having this forum to read what everyone else goes through and it really helps to know what to expect. Even though we are all different, we still go through a lot of similar things.",
