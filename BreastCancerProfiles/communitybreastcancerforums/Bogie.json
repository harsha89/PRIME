The same thing happened to me although I did have an MRI and Ultrasound before my mastectomy and it still didn't show up. In fact it didn't even show up to my surgeon during my surgery. It wasn't until the path report is where it showed up! This tells me there is NO test out there to catch tumors even invasive ones. Now that is scary!",

On another note, is dissection (removal) of the lymphnodes, I had 5 removed during my bilateral mastectomy the same as you are talking about to biopsy lymphnodes? If not wondering what surgeons don't biopsy them surin surgery and only remove them if the cancer spread into them. I feel like this is a stupid question but I'm suddenly confused now. I'm 4 weeks post op and just putting the pieces all together now, everything happened soooo fast. Thanks for any clarifications.",

Cookie I didn't have the deep done he wouldn't do it with bilateral MX,so just had expanders. My breast incisions are not healing well, in part I think because I had allergic reaction as well very bad one from surgery. BS thinks its from the benzoin and not the surgical tape. You are smart to get allergy testing done. I put prescription steroid ointment on surrounding area but couldn't on the incision, I think this kept it from healing. I'm 4 weeks post op and still open areas in the wounds. Going to ps this morning again he watches it weekly. not one DR. Mentioned to see an allergist.... It's like pulling teeth just to get HMO referrals for Oncologist, BS, Lymphadema specialist alone, makes me crazy! As for work short term disability, this should have been done by your HR dept. at work, they complete a portion, you complete a portion, and your surgeon completes his portion of the claim. Then needs to be faxed in to the insurance co. Someone at your work needs to assist you with that prior to your leave. I have found I've become a barracuda in the medical field in the U.S. or no one will take care of it for you. Kara, my Oncologist told me Tamoxifen is for premenopausal women and besides hot flashes side effects you have to be concerned about bloot clots and some cardiac. We have stoke in family history so I didnt want to risk that. Since I'm right on the line of menopause he may put me on Arimidex or something like that for over menopausal women, I'm 54 and act 23 lol, so not sure where I fall into. No one recommended to have the blood test to determine. This drug side affect is risk of some bone loss so he is sending me for a bone density scan first and will load me up on vitamin D or injections of it once in awhile just to head it off.

Also did not put arms over head until drains were out, then started daily exercising and stretching to post MX tape given to me from American cancer society. hope this helps, good luck!",

BS thinks its from the benzoin (sp) cleaning stuff they put on before surgery. I took a 20 min walk around the block with my dog and husband, boy did that feel good. Not every day you get 57 degree weather in Chicago in January. I did not have a catheter, so if you are having a bilateral mastectomy with nodes taken out prepare to see bright blue pee the first day in the hospital. No one warned me and I freaked out... What the??? It's from the dye they inject for surgeon to find lymph nodes. HER2 test came back today negative, now two week wait for oncotype. Appointment with PS in the a.m. Hoping to get last drain out. My chest doesn't look good, its not healing great from the allergic reaction and the incision split a little on one side when at the hospital. He may have to re do it again. Back to work in 3 weeks, wish I could get all the testing done and some treatments out of the way first, all the tests take sooooo long. I'm enjoying being home from work with my dog bogie by my side, my yellow lab is like Velcro he won't leave my side, so cute! Has anyone tried sleeping on their side after Bilateral mastectomy?

I'm 1 week ahead of you and although I did have skin sparing with expanders put in, I am far from healing. I don't have staple, I have stitches. The incision split on one side and both sides are red and not healing on target, we just have to be patient. Don't lay there in pain take Motrin or something. If the incisions get dry and cracked put on Aquaphor or antibiotic ointment my PS told me. None of us look good at this stage including me, my oncologist was also a bit taken back. Most people I know who didn't have reconstruction always had it 1-3 years later. If you do want that option later your bs gave you that opportunity. If you don't ever want implants then I'm sure the PS can fix the extra skin very easily, they can do just about anything these days. Get some sleep, give this all time to sink in, remember one step at a time and cosmetics can always be fixed. I would still discuss it with your BS though on why it was not clear what you had requested. Hang in there, I have found crying to be therapeutic and cleansing, then I go for a walk outside and get some air and exercise, this will heighten you emotionally and physically. Be glad you are not in Chicago, we have snow and wet streets, makes it tough to walk...take advantage of your nice weather. Hugs..this too shall pass.",

I think going to the pt will help. Next challenge Arimidex, has anyone started on this drug yet? I have to stop reading Internet side effects and just focus on how to combat them. Arimidex thread will be my next stop, and will always stay with my December sisters thread to take the journey together. Gold you inspire us all with your marathon running, congrats! Makes me want to keep exercising big time to gain more endurance to handle a demanding job. I've begun mixing a daily drink in the blender of various Fruits and vegetables to get in my daily allowance. Trick: If you just add an apple it will cut bitter tasting anything. I just throw in any/all I have on hand. Broccoli, carrots, frozen mix bag of berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries) banana, pineapple,even spinach leaves and surprisingly it's an 8 oz glass of delicious smoothie! people caring for people, we are lucky to be alive and I'm ready now to pay it forward!",

Spunky I had the same discussion with my MO so I am leaning toward Aridimex for the same reasons of family history with blood clots and stroke, so well get osteoporosis instead...grrr can't win. I am going to check with him on yearly med or shots to prevent bone loss. Fish oils will help with joint pain and muscle aches I'm told. I'm trying to learn all I can before I make a decision.",

One side that tore is not closing up and the other side has a few gaps, but seems to be trying to heal and are much smaller. The large opening is where it tore in the hospital. PS said if it doesn't improve In another week, he has to go in clean it out and restiched it in his office. I'm going back to work next week and worry about infection. Went to get my blood pressure and blood drawn this morning and \"again\" another office was unable to get an accurate blood pressure in my calf, it was much higher than normal, so they just give up, nice huh? Then I went to the lab to get a blood draw. I told them I had a bilateral MX and Need to just take it from the arm where no lymph nodes were taken out. I then told her I'd prefer my leg if possible,and if taken from my arm NO turnakit. Her response was we are not trained to take blood from any place but the arm and you will have to go to the hospital for that. I said ok take it from the arm and do not use the turnakit, she tried and could not get any blood. So put a band aid on it and sent me home to hydrate more and come back tomorrow. I'm very frustrated. My lymphadema specialists said she prefer no blood draws even on the good side where no lymph nodes taken out. I can't believe we are the only people on earth requesting this. The lymphadema specialist is much more cautious than my surgeon. What's a girl to do.",

That score, especially if low is under the assumption you will be receiving Hormonal Therapy 5 year drug. This is what both my Oncologist and Breast Surgeon told me. When I asked what would happen if I refused it for any reason? If you are ER/PR positive I was told its more than a few % benefit. I was told 50% to be exact. You may want to seek a second opinion on that one. We seem to have the same diagnosois, I also had a bilateral MX but once it's determined invasive there should be no question. Even when it was just DCIS, my original diagnosis the plan was to go on Tamoxifen, Radiation with a lumpectomy. I had a score of 7 on the Oncotype and will be starting Arimidex next week, no chemo. Am I looking forward to it...heck NO! I hate the sound of all the side effects, but if I have a reoccurrence I will know I did what I needed to block those receptors feeding into the growth of developing new cancer cells. It's a personal choice, I even sought a second opinion on treatment and both Medical Oncologist agreed to do the antihormonal drugs, so I will and only pray I can tolerate the side effects. I hope this sheds some light on another view from another sister :). It's always such a tough decision to be given choices. Knowledge is power...",

Your so called new breast turns into either a baseball or a coconut depending on the size. Basically hard as a rock! Looks great in clothes but feels strange Appt. with PS tomorrow and should know if it's back to the OR again for me. A one hour surgery to remove all the scar tissue built around the expander. I have only had one small fill. We can't proceed until it softens or is surgically removed. I never thought I'd say this but it actually feels good to be back at work. Starting slow working 3 days week until the end of the month. Feels good to forget about cancer, doctors, expanders and tight chest. Finaly feeling some relief and sleeping on my side for a few hours anyway! Until my arm fall asleep and then I'm paranoid about LE.

Cookie Don't even get me started about drama in the workplace, as if we don't have enough to worry and stress over, please! I run and run fast from that BSn no time, life is too short. It's stressfull to even watch and so mundane to me since going through this. Blessings, yes I am headed back to surgery In April to replace TE and treat CC (Capsule Contracture). Surgeon said it was caused because my incision tore and too much scar tissue built up. It's a one hour surgery. Once healed I can begin fills then. BTW Incision tore in the hospital! I leaned back in bed and fell back was more like it, ummm someone neglected to tell me you come out of BMX surgery with no back core muscles to control leaning back slowly into bed. Been paying for it since. Good news is feels awesome to sleep on my side again. Just hope I'm not in for more drains, how does one do that one and work??? Geesh. Sleep is vital with these busy days and back to work full time plus managing a household still. Was'nt the latest research showing \"Stress\" is a contributing factor to cancer? Ya think..haha Wishing all of you peace and pain free happy days to all my dec sisters! Stay strong and fight like a girl, I refuse to allow surgeries or side effects win!!< Remember we are women, therefor we are survivors!! God Bless- Karen/p>",

The breast cancer has NOT spread to my lungs or bones. Although breast cancer can spread to your kidneys it's rare, therefor right now they believe this is a secondary cancer that has been growing for years. We are hoping to save as much of the kidney as possible for a better long term survival rate. I'm scheduled for the latest technology with Davinci Robotics. It's amazing how far we have come with advanced medicine techniques. I'm going to one of the top surgeons and feel I'm in good hands. Good news is they feel the breast cancer has been nipped in the bud, and this is completely unrelated to this secondary cancer. I had a cat scan due to stomach bloat since my MX and this was found in error, no symptoms. Turns out stomache bloat has nothing to do with kidneys, so that portion still a mystery. I'm staying strong and going to fight it! Chemo or radiation does not help with kidney cancer so there is no follow up, other than ultrasounds every 3 months. God Bless you all and positive thoughts. I'm going back to trying to minimize my stress and get my fruits and veggies in. Hugs to all my sisters and thank for your kind words :)",

My BS said this will determine if I will have chemo. Friend of mine oncologist told her he recommends chemo for any invasive breast cancer, which I have. didn't know until surgical pathology report that it was invasive. I'm afraid to have chemo and I'm afraid not too. Anxious to get Oncotype test back, and meet with an Oncologist. I'll become a hippie again with bandanas at work, hear the wigs are hot and itch. I'm glad to have found this site, we can stay strong together. Although a melt down once in awhile feels cleansing at times, mostly when I'm overtired.",

Carolann, I agree I'm also 3 weeks post op bilateral mastectomy with TA and seemed to really turn the corner the last few days. It took from August until 12/20 to get my surgery scheduled. My BS took so many test, MRI,core and needle biopsies, ultrasound, and every test seemed to take longer than the one before for results. BS continued to tell me, no risk in waiting yours is not invasive, they took their sweet time about it all, I was at thier Mercy reluctantly. So I dove into work in the meantime. Well low and behold turned out it was Invasive ! Its been a long 5 months of aggravation, and I haven't even gotten my Oncotype test or comple treatment plan yet. I'm again trying to be patient...grrrrr",

He said the Oncotype test will be back by the end of this week. Other than initial diagnosis I think this is the second hardest test result to wait for. I also got blood drawn today (per my request) to see if I'm in menopause to determine which hormone therapy drug I will be given. I was scared to have a blood draw with double masectomy even on the side no lymph nodes were taken out. The lab nurse said to always have them draw blood without the turnicate, I think that is how it's spelled. Has anyone gotten a second opinion either from pathology slides or on treatment from your current path report? If so, was there any difference and was it a difficult process. I see MD Anderson and John Hopkins have online second opinions. I May look into Rush, any suggestions? I think my OC is very good just not sure QI need to go that rout or not. Someone helped me today outside my Oncologist office when I dropped a handful of things. This woman was so nice, she told me if people would just start caring about people again in this world, there would be no war. I thanked her, and told her how kind she was, that I had just been diagnosed with cancer. She said she just lost her husband , and I began to cry. I think hearing my own words telling a perfect stranger I hade cancer, and her kindness after her tremendous loss,it got me sobbing...geesh.",

To date I have been unable to have any fills until it closes up. Ironically, it has closed a little more in the last few weeks so I was able to get both breasts filled for the first time today. Although one side looked deflated and the other side has grown into a large hard baseball! My PS told me its a hard shell of scar tissue that has formed around my expander and if it doesn't break down after this first fill, another surgery will need to be done....sigh.

Kam, I'm not sure any any cancer is without complications and that certainly goes for the kidneys, it's a major organ and very invasive. I always knew with breast cancer it's almost an external part of your body and not even close to complications of a major organ and organ surgery quote unquote from my breast surgeon. You need your kidneys to function, you don't need breasts to function. Cancer is sneaky at all costs. This is a BC site so I'll stick to that topic here and will have to find a Kidney cancer site.

I was going through multiple tests brain MRI, scans etc. They wanted to be sure the cancer didn't metastasize and were in fact two primary cancers of Breast and Kidney. I'm happy to announce the tests are all done and the results are good! Ginger, what kind of stomach issues are you having? Please demand a cat scan of your stomach and pelvis if you are not satisfied. Keep us all posted and don't worry until you get all tests completed. I have actually gotten good at the hurry and wait game. I seem to be more mellow this second round for some odd reason, or I'm just worn out from it all. I am doing very well and on my way to recovery, work and life. One more consult next week to determine if my thyroid will need to come out due to large size nodule. Other than that I'm doing well. So great to read up on all the news, and I'm sorry if I worried you. I just had to get through over a month of tests, and the outcomes were good. Then I could spent some time with my family for Christmas, better than last years. Hoping that God blesses all of you with good health and a Happy New Year 2013! Stay positive and live, laugh, love!!
