I don't if it is similar where you are, but here each breast clinic has breast care nurses who act like a key worker really, provide support and go through lots of the options, results etc in detail - more than the consultant would. From what I can gather they have made a later appoitnment so that she is there to go through things. At least she told me something on the phone and I know I have to go back to get it taken out.",

I am in the middle of a drawn out waiting game for a definative result and am wondering how worried I should be. I am feeling pretty neutral I guess - but won't jump for joy...yet, which is the pressure I am feeling from loved ones around me. July 1st noticed that when I lift up my right arm the area under that breast was all pulled in and mishapened. Had appointment at a bresat clinic 17th July - mammogram showed architectural distortion in that area, nothing on ultrasound and as no palpable lump had to go back 23rd July for sterotactic biopsy. Was told results 7-10 days but I go back for the results appointment on 14th August.(As it was so far ahead presumed all OK) This was too long for me to know if there was any further intervention needed so rang the breast care nurse - she said that the appointment was later so that she could be there. What she has told me was that the team \"think\" it is due to benign changes (don't know what sort yet) but that they want to wire and take the whole area out. I presume that this is because they remain concerned. This is why I don't want to celebrate just yet - or am I over reacting? Thanks for reading this Cath Log in to post a reply",
