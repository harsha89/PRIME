The problem was that I was very small breasted and the lump was very close to the nipple and would be more than a little disfiguring. Being the age that I was -on the elderly side-I said that I wantedÂ  bilateral. No way did I want to be worrying about this for the rest of my life. So that is what I had done and guess what? The pathology report after surgery showed a small malignancy in the other breast that did not show up on any x-ray or the MRI that was done just before surgery..My Ocologist said that she would have chosen the same way although she said that she got a lot of flack from the breast conference doctors when she presented my case at the meting before surgery. It will be 4 years this June and so far so good. I still see her every 3 months and the surgeon every 6 months so I am well checked.Am also happy with my decision. I never give breast cancer a thought--.Well maybe a little---that there will be mets somewhere at some point.But because of my age I really do not dwell on that. I feel that I am doing the best that I can .Take care every one Eileen",
