The tightness and pain are always with me, even the pain pills don't help much. I can't sleep in my bed which I miss the most. I sleep in a recliner. I finally got rid of the drains on Monday. I just wonder when the heaviness and tightness on my chest will let up.  I thought I was stronger then I am and I haven't cried not through all the MRI's with needle biopsies or the core biopsies or the two lumpectomies and all the other tests and probing but now that everything is done and I'm on my way to healing I feel like all I want to do is cry. Of the 17 lymph node disctions only one came back with cancer. I do not have to do Chemo or radiation. So I am extremely happy about that. I'm just feeling like I am sinking into this depression. I just want to feel normal again. When will that happen?  Log in to post a reply",
