I am having a very difficult time with all the process and what will be done. I guess I am feeling sorry for myself. I did not want to schedule anything during the holidays and this weekend is my Mom's 80th birthday party, so I have waited until today to begin the scheduling process. Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. I am scared. falinda",
