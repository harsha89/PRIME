Just curious!  Robin Log in to post a reply",

Called the doctor Sunday because I was yellow from head to toe.  He decided to have me go into the office Monday for blood work rather than take me  away from my  family.  Got the results Tuesday the 23rd...not good news.  Seems my liver is being taken over by the cancer and they are now telling me I may have months not years.   Good Christmas present, right?!!  Blew me right out of the water!!  They offered me a medical trial at Lake Ireland Cancer Center in Cleveland that is testing drugs on people like me.  In fact I got the call today that I have an appointment on Jan 9th to see the doctor in charge.  I am hoping and praying whatever they offer can put my liver back into stability.  In the  meantime I've decided to contact Hospice to help my family cope with all of this.  They're offering grief councilling for everyone and I know we all need that.  They are also helping out with some of my drugs and with spiritual councilling.  Chemo has been completely eliminated because it was causing more harm than good.  I'm also not allowed to take Aleve anymore so they brought out the big guns Oxycotin.  Haven't had to take any and don't plan on it unless its absolutely necessary. I'm hoping against hope that the doctors are wrong and that somehow I can rally and get better.  Miracles happen right?  Robin Log in to post a reply",
