I did find a hard mass in my other breast, have gone trough simlier test like yours, I have a mri on the 14th of this month to determine if I have to see a surgen to have a biopsi on it. I also have discharge from my breast, seen my onogoligist and was told I had a breast infection, well took all the medication they gave me and it is still there, was told that if it continues I will need to see a surgen. Well I have to say I think that we women know our own bodies and when see, feel or suspect that something is not quite right with our bodies we should do every thing in our power to take care of it no matter what the Dr's have to say, they need to stop and really listen to what we are telling or showing them. We really do know what we are talking about.",
