I am er/pr negative, her2+, so we were only discussing my situation. Based on her knowledge and studies done at MSK, if I can get to 5 years out from completing chemo, which for me was July '05, then I am nearly clear sailing. Up until 5 years it is touch and go. Still today the hope is that Herceptin long term will have done all it was suppose to do to keep a recurrence from happening, but the study for non-mets patients just isn't old enough to state whether that is the case or not. She said that er/pr positive girls do not necessarily have the 5 year rule as recurrence can occur later, although I'm not suggesting in any way that it will occur at all. Our therapies today are so much more aggressive and successful than the older studies have indicated. Just wanted to share what I learned this week. Best wishes, Kim",

      "Content": "Oct 5, 2007 08:15AM - edited Oct 5, 2007 08:15AM by kimf Yesterday was okay with my FIL. He had another CT scan (they wanted their own..you know how hospitals are). They are doing the biopsy this morning. It will be a fine needle biopsy - hoping for the pathology by Monday. On Monday they will put the stint in, too. I've been reading a lot and trying to learn as much as I can as quickly as possible to help them through this. They are not great with computers. I'm printing articles from Memorial Sloan Kettering and Hopkins hoping the information is valid. Generally, if the tumor is inoperable, it might not go well. Yesterday, the surgeon told my FIL it was inoperable. So... you know.  I had to tell him yesterday that they found a spot on his liver that might be a metastasis. He didn't know that. Do you think that is possible? They didn't tell him? Or that he just didn't understand it when the Onc explained the MRI results? This is frustrating.  I'll let you know more when I know. Thanks for the prayers. Kim",

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2007 04:25PM - edited Oct 7, 2007 04:25PM by kimf Thanks VV, it is hard being the dil and not knowing how much I should say, or not say. Linda, I will be in touch! You are going to be an excellent source of info, I can tell. Thank you for your thoughts! I am very outspoken and usually try to say it politically correct, but still, this is hard. The latest....they did the biopsy on Friday and sent my fil home. He wasn't resting well in the hospital so they sent him home to await the biopsy results. I thought they would do the stint by Monday, but they said they are waiting for the biopsy results. Why? The stint is necessary no matter what, so why wait? I'm worried they will determine that it has progressed too far already and that they aren't going to insert the stint. Instead, they are suggesting draining the fluid to relieve him a bit. I think that is crap. They should be putting the stint in for long term relief. His care coordinator happens to be a family friend, the only one at the cancer center, so she will be honest with me, I believe. My MIL doesn't get it. She said, \"if it was serious\" a few times and I wanted to strangle her. WTF does it have to be to be classified as serious to her???? Okay, one piece of good news....most of you know I'm a huge Springsteen fan. I've seen him dozens of times. Friday night, Pete, my brother Dave, and I went into Philly and saw him, which was great. But even better, we went back in town last night for night #2 in Philly and brought my boys!  I was so psyched! They are fans by default..they haven't had the chance to not be! They had a blast. I was tickled to be able to share the night with them. Now for the last bit of potentially bad news. God, does it ever end? My brother Dave...who is one of my best friends. We have the same group of friends from high school, we went to college together, we lived together after college...you get the picture. Anyway...he has had two surgeries for diverticulitis and was told he wouldn't have any more problems after the last surgery. Two weeks ago he started having pain, so went for a CT scan immediately. Friday before the concert he went to see is PCP who told him his colon looks clean, but there is a 5 mm \"something\" on his left lung. Can you freakin believe that? Now he has to have another CT and a chest Xray. He was never a smoke, thank God, so we are really, really hopeful this is nothing. If it is something, I am going to completely lose it. This is just too much. I'm overwhelmed. And I don't like being overwhelmed. Not at all. I'm off to visit my fil and have some homemade italian pasta for dinner. Be envious! The one thing my mil can do well is cook some mean spaghetti! Thanks for letting me vent. Kim",

One day.... I mentioned several times that my father in law is really sick. The doctors are thinking he has cholangiocarcinoma, i.e.: bile duct cancer, but they have been unsuccessful in obtaining a biopsy. He did have a drainage tube inserted to drain the bile that had backing up. It was working and his bilirubin level was reducing, but a few days ago he took a bad turn. He wouldn't eat or drink, wanted to only sleep, didn't communicate well. I walked in yesterday and he looked terrible. I used his blood pressure cuff and tried 4 times to get a reading and it wouldn't pick anything up. I rushed him to the hospital and his bp was 77/45. Turns out, he was so severely dehydrated since he was refusing to eat and drink that he went into renal failure. They've been able to stablize him with IV & antibiotics, but his kidneys have not started working (24 hours later) so he might be facing dialysis within the next day. He also is going through a slew of tests to determine what else is wrong. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers this weekend. Thanks so much, Kim",

Luv2laff, my thyroid cancer was dx'd after breast cancer, but it existed prior to chemo. Unfortunately, it biopsied negative at first.

I realize newbies will look here, too, and you are more than welcome to jump into any and all subjects that float in here. Originally the hey girls was just to catch up with us old timers that were dx'd 3 - 5 years ago. We don't all frequent the boards any longer, so therefore, the post. Today I'm updating it with a hello to everyone! It has been way too long since we last all connected and I wanted to see how everyone is doing. Many of us are on facebook, which is awesome, but not everyone. I'll start...I'm doing GREAT! I don't see my Onc until January, but last I knew NED was still my best bud! I've had some depression issues with menopause, but switched meds and am hoping for the best. Menopause stinks but the hot flashes are so much better than before. I have gained weight, like most women seem to, and I don't like it, but am dealing and trying to be more active and eat better. The family is great. All are healthy. The flu has not hit our house yet, but is in the kids schools. I'm coming up on my 5 year cancerversary in December and am happy to pass that milestone!!!!!  My Onc uses the end of treatment as the 5 year mark, but I'm using my dx day. That's the day I became a survivor! How is everyone else? I know a few of us have passed on and others have progressed, but those of you still lurking in stage III, fill me in! Miss you all and pray for all of you here daily. Kimf",

I'm so sorry you  had to go through that. I had 15+ nodes and never do scans. I was alarmed at first, too. Wanted to make sure everything worked etc. But my Onc does do tumor markers (blood tests) to check for fluctuations. Thankfully, she's right, I didn't need them so far. I have no symptoms, no changes in tumor markers and have been living without treatment for years. Some Onc's do scans regularly, others don't. I go to one of the top hospitals in the nation, hell, I didn't even have a port. They said it wasn't necessary until it was necessary. I got through 8 rounds of chemo and a year of herceptin on one arm. So...everyone is different. Another reason my Onc doesn't do scans is that if you have metastacized you will know it from pain, dizziness, shortness of breath etc. and you should be instructed to call if you ever have symptoms. You are in one of the scariest stages right now...finishing treatment. I think there is a thread on this board dedicated to that specifically so you can experience it with others at the same time. Look for it, it might help you feel better if others are being told the same stuff.  Good luck and feel good about yourself that you are getting ready to start rads. That's a great accomplishment!

Kari, I wish I could say the pain is gone, but its not. But I know what it isn't....bone mets...so I don't care as much that it hurts. Pete is trying to massage it out each night. I think it is stress. Now to unload again...my father in law has been really sick for like 2 months. He had pneumonia that didn't seem to go away, kept running a fever, bad cough, couldn't eat well due to mucous and reflux. Finally, he went back to the doc after weeks of this and two antibiotics not working and the doc had a CT scan done. They found a mass around his gall bladder, kidney & intestine. He had a second CT on Monday and an MRI today, tomorrow he sees an Oncologist for the results of these two tests. I know I've asked so much from you in the past...but I really need positive vibes and if you believe, prayers please. The Onc suggested that if the tumor was wrapped around these organs that there might not be anything to do. I cannot accept that - you know me....do anything and everything. I volunteered to go with him and my MIL tomorrow to the Onc, but they haven't called back so I don't know if they want me tagging along. My FIL is only 72 and has been working full time with our business year round forever. He's been so healthy. I'm in disbelief that this could be inoperable cancer. Well, I'll let you know as soon as I can what his status is, but thanks in advance for your vibes (and prayers!). Kim",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2007 07:11AM - edited Oct 4, 2007 07:11AM by kimf Well, the Oncologist appt yesterday for my FIL didn't go so well. He has a large mass encompassing his gall bladder and bile duct, involving the liver as well, that is suffocating the common bile duct. The mass is most likely malignant, either originating in the gall bladder, but more likely a very rare cancer that starts in the bile duct called Cholangiocarcinoma. There will be a biopsy to confirm this. He has a fever and infection, so they want to treat him right away and admitted him into the hospital yesterday afternoon. The Resident Surgeon that I met last night said they will most likely put a stint into the bile duct to open the passageway to help the bile move. He is very jaundice right now and we know that his liver function isn't great. All his symptoms, weight loss, fatigue, jaundice, a sense of fullness...he has them all. The worst ...they found a spot on his liver that appears to be a metastasis. Ugh! I can't believe this. Keep the pos vibes and prayers coming. We need them! Thanks for your encouraging words. Kim",

Wish I was coming to visit!  Next time I'm in Japan I'll let you know, okay? My father in law is doing a bit better. He is still on dialysis, but there is improvement with his kidneys. He has stablized enough that the doctors are going to do dialysis tomorrow morning, then do the laproscopic biopsy afterward (not sure what time). It seems like a lot for him since he is really just back to eating and can barely stand he is so weak, but we have to find out what is causing all this so he can be treated. If it is cancer, then chemo can begin. If it isn't, then surgery seems the logical choice. Either way, I'm very worried since he is so weak, but he's a fighter. I can see where my dh gets his drive from that's for sure. I'm off to put the kiddies to bed. Take care, Kim",

So, will hopefully have good news by the end of that day. As for the thyroid questions...sorry I'm so tardy in responding. There is just one correlation between thyroid and breast cancer that I know of...it is called \"Cowden's disease\" (sp?). There is a blood test that can be drawn to test for this through a genetic counselor. My results took 10 mos to get back and I was negative. My thyroid cancer was dx'd after my breast, but the nodules and goiter were there from the onset. They were two completely separate cancers. Just another way I try to be an overachiever, that's all. The thyroid cancer was very early, did not spread and with it being removed and one radioactive iodine treatment, I haven't worried about it since. Stage IIIC breast cancer worries me enough anyway!  Let me know how you both made out with your appointments. MaryAnne, so you finally did it? Had the recon and it didn't turn out they way you hoped. Did you do the expanders? How do they feel? Do you feel better? I'll be thinking of you and hope to hear that everything matches up this time. I haven't done the nipple yet, either. Its been over 3 years for me. Not sure I will or not. Heck, I still haven't had the lift and I have one hell of a saggy, breastfed three kids, breast going on there. What am I waiting for????

      "Content": "Jun 28, 2008 01:20PM - edited Jun 28, 2008 01:23PM by kimf I was dx'd with stage IIIC IDC in 12/04. Had LB mast, recon, 15/23+ nodes. Did dd a/c, Taxol & a year of herceptin. During all this, we knew from the first CT scan that I had a large thyroid goiter and 7 nodules. I had the goiter biopsied and it was negative - the procedure was uncomfortable but not incredibly so - breast stuff is much more painful. Due to the number of nodules & size of the goiter, when I was nearly done the Herceptin, I had a total thyroidectomy. Turns out the goiter was cancerous. It was dx'd papillary ca, follicular variant. The treatment was having had the surgery and I did one radioactive iodine treatment. I take Synthroid every day and have no issues whatsoever. I was scared to death for a second ca dx, but the doctors all assure me that this thyroid cancer won't shorten my life by even one day. Sending pos vibes your way. Kim Oops, I just reread your posts above and see that the biopsy was benign! That's awesome. So glad for you.",

I wrapped for 3 months, then wore a sleeve and glove for another 3 and had manual lymph drainage done several times a week with success. Thankfully I had a complete recovery and have been fine for 4 years. I can't say this isn't a new lymphedema, although that was in my lower arm/hand and this is my breast, but I will certainly pay close attention as I know the only reason I successfully got rid of my last swelling was because I dx'd it right away. Never thought of LE, so again, thank you!",
