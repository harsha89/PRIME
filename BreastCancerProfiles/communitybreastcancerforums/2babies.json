      "Content": "2babies wrote: Hi everyone, last month I found two lumps in my breasts that were not normal for me. I have very large breasts, and have a tendency to develop cysts especially before my time of the month. I found the lumps a week after my period in October. They didn't change after this last cycle so I called the doctor. I have one lump that feels like a hard mike and ike with rough ends. I have a hard time locating this bump. The one I am worried about is in my left breast not far below the skin. It is rock hard and feels like a bumpy bebe. It stays in the same place and almost feels like it is attached to a vein. When I went into the Ob/Gyn he found five lumps in right breast and the one in the left. He said the good news was he thought none of them were attached but he was sending me for an ultrasound and then probably to a breast surgeon. I am trying not to worry but not doing a very good job at it. I do my checks regularly and these feel different than before. I have two little girls ages 3 & 5 and I am only 28 with no family history of BC. I know my odds are good but I still can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. Log in to post a reply",

I'm having my ultrasound this week but the doctor already told me the lumps didn't feel like cysts to him and he was going to send me to the surgeon. I know the odds are good that its benign but it doesn't make finding a lump any less scary. I came on here looking for support as well. I needed someone to talk to and didn't want to burden my family. No one has responded to my post either in the Not Diagnosed Forum and I posted two days ago. I am praying that you get negative results and if you need someone to talk to please feel free to message me. I wish I had more answers for you and for myself.",
