For anyone prone to gastric/acid reflux troubles, Pappadeaux may not be the best choice!  I had a single crabcake and was unhappy with the aftereffects.  Nothing from the chemo, all acid but neutralized finally with Malox.  Did walk yesterday (2 miles) but less today(3/4 mile).  Feeling slower overall, not interested in food but have downed two protein shakes and am having a raw vegetable juice for energy and vitamins.  Julie H: I was given EMEND in a drip and told it would stay in my system 5 days, but I had break through nausea from the beginning.  It's true, taking the anti-nausea meds on time is better than after you need it.  I've experienced that already, though today was great that way because I did it on time.  I'm hoping to go to work tomorrow but will see how my energy feels.  Proud-Mom:I read about fasting somewhere on this site, if not this thread.  I haven't researched it very much.  You can't go wrong checking with your own doctor.  I have just under three weeks before my next chemo and hope to learn more before making up my mind.  One of my other threads I follow is the marathon runners one under fitness.  Those ladies really inspired me to do something, even at my slow pace due to knee surgery a couple years ago.  I have since learned on this site that studies show bc patients who exercise, no matter how moderately, bounce back faster, have better energy levels, and can reduce recurrence by up to 40-50%.  If I find the study, I will post it.  That is what made me determined to try:D  I know there will be days I won't be up to it, but even a little helps and that gives me hope.  Good luck to all; I will see how days 3-5 go and pray for low side effects!",

Post lumpectomy and chemo, I'm walking at maybe 1.5 to 2 mph speed, which is quite slow.  I stay in my neighborhood, because I want to be near if I tire or need the restroom.  We are about to get cold and rainy, so I'll prob. stick to the treadmill for a few minutes if possible when I can.  Hope these articles help anyone interested in the benefits of moderate exercise through chemo.  A doctor's advice is important, esp. at a time like this.  Exercise was the last thing on my mind when I got diagnosed, it was only the wealth of wisdom and experience on this site that got me headed in that direction.    http://www.livestrong.com/article/94144-exercise-breast-cancer/ http://www.livestrong.com/article/55159-statistics-breast-cancer-recurrence/ http://breastcancer.about.com/od/riskfactorsindetail/a/exercise_bc.htm http://ww2.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Exercise_Can_Improve_Breast_Cancer_Survival.asp",

I stocked my chemo box and daily supply bag from it, though I learn from everyone here almost everyday too.  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/706846?page=2#idx_31 Jane I'm 9 days post 1 of 4 FEC, but I'm doing 12 Taxol afterward.  The first one seemed fairly uneventful, though constipation and nausea have been a constant.  Having the treatment on Friday afternoon allowed me to return to work on Monday, but I ate food too soon on that day and ended up going home from the acid/gastric problems.  For me, protein milkshakes and yogurt were best those first five days.  My exp. with the food has led me to take it one bite at a time, after which I wait a bit to see if it feels safe to continue with more.   I'm asking my onco Monday about Taxol vs. Taxotere; it would be nice to understand why he chose that for me.  Melissa : Thanks for posting your post-hair photo.  You guys look great, and what a great guy you have Melissa!  I'm borrowing courage from everyone here because that's the next \"phase\" to deal with for me. Jane your hair sounds so beautiful; mine never gets beyond shoulder length, too hot and humid where I live!  Good to know about protecting the follicles, hadn't seen that before. ",

However the style I liked was out of stock, luckily a local shop carried it and it was perfect for me.  Not too fluffly and a good length.  My hairdresser was wonderful about layering it a bit to look more like me.  Turns out his 86 year old mom survived a masectomy 5 yrs ago, and his dad is dealing with cancer also now.  He was so compassionate and kind.  I'm going back to get buzzed in about a week or so.  Would rather take control than watch it melt off me.  Good luck everyone, you guys are in my thoughts and prayers also.  I'm hoping for the best but I'll have all my chemo supplies at the ready, just in case:D",

I bet I didn't need to do that to myself.  If it helps prevent nausea, fasting will be worth it.  I'll see how I get through the weekend and the workweek. BTW, once I got my diagnosis I got back on a calorie counter, the one at LiveStrong.com.  I'm really concerned about getting enough calories on the bad days, though I suppose there's not much I can do about it if I'm off food a few days.  Will try to post later, nausea has subsided about 80% while writing this  ",

Good luck Christine47!  Port removal and implant exchange is a lot to go through, but you've come a long way.  This short week was nice; I keep thinking how much better each holiday/family event will be next year. Hot flashes can be on schedule?  Good to know ProudMom--hope mine come after five when I start on Tamoxifen later on.  Most of mine so far came mainly with the FEC at the beginning of all this.  I've hardly had any since, though like Betsy says, in this heat it can be hard to tell when your sweating outdoors.  Lake Tahoe sounds wonderful; lucky you!",

I'm seeing my onco on Monday and will check on that and on adding Physllium Husk to shakes for fiber, as another friend also recommended.  Does anyone know if it's ok to continue taking vitamin supplements through chemo?  I haven't got around to seeking approval and just stopped taking a multi-vitamin from a health food store and extra iron.  I will check with the doctor Monday about that.  Too scared to mess with the treatments to do anything without prior approval:D Heard that Michael Douglas kicked his throat cancer but is trying to replace the 30 pounds he lost through the treatments.  That sounds like a lot of weight; could that happen to us?",

My stylist was more shocked than I; being young and never having a female client ask for one, she was reluctant to cut it all off.  I had to say \"cancer\" two or three times before she relaxed and did it for me.  She made me promise to return once my hair comes back so she can do it for me then:D  AimeeMac: So far the head feels cool, though I've gone through two nights of night sweats.  I wouldn't mind it so much if only I didn't wake up through it.  For me though, a cap after a bath is a must because I'm actually cold there.  The wig on my first full day with it at work was wierd, kept tugging on it.  Like MaryMeg, I worried it would pop off somehow, but I don't know how a gel band would help.  Wouldn't it make it feel tighter?  I just want to get used to it because where I work, someone would be bound to come take my cap/scarf off for grins, and I can't even think about that, lol!

JeanH: At 50 myself and knee surgery behind me, the coming Nulasta this week makes me nervous. I've got the Claritin, L-Glutamine, and B6/12 going on or in the chemo box ready to go.  Hope that's enough ammunition b/c I don't look forward to more knee pain.  Only time will tell I guess, but eeeek!  Ck-Moma: thanks for the neuropathy study link.  The words \"nerve damaging process\" chilled my blood.  We need more ammunition against SE's.

The cap is very comfortable and adjusts to your size head.  I liked the bob because of the length, then had it layered to look like I normally wear mine.  The internet sites that carried this style happened to be out of my color, so I called a local shop.  Not only did they carry it, but it was half price!  Since the store is not one of my insurance providers, I was very happy with that price.  My friends and family love it and say it looks like real hair.  I've already washed it once, following all the recommendations for wig care, and it turned out nicely.  The one tip I would give you is get a wide tooth, metal pick to comb it with.  The salesperson was not knowledgeable and I ended up sort of messing up the bottom layer by using a regular brush. I had to trim off bits of it with small sciccors.   The wig care videos on this website are excellent.  I failed to do enough homework at the time and relied on the store clerks.  But if you like your wig, you'll want to protect it.

Hope you are feeling better JulieH.  I want the port out asap but my doctor wants me to keep it in for TWO years, just in case.  That really bothered me on first hearing about it, and even more now when I see that it's not standard to do that.  When I go to MD Anderson in a couple weeks for post-chemo exams, will def. look into that.  So glad for all of you making it through rads.  I'm right behind you, keeping up the fight.  How is everyone's energy level post chemo?  I'm still able to walk, but nowhere what I used to.  On my 3 or so \"bad days\" I don't make it past a 1/2 mile if that, on my \"strong\" days leading up to the next chemo, the most I strive for is 2 miles.  Is it possible or even advised to exercise during radiation?  I've been cursed (yes, cursed) with a D cup since high school and hear larger women have more skin issues.  Not to mention that those of us in hot climes find it challengeing anyway, but this chemo fatigue bugs the heck out of me and walking is the only way I know to beat it back a little. Happy Fourth to all:D ",

I'm worried about the effects of the strong sun and heat, because that's not so good for us either.  All these side effects and weather weirdness to boot, NOT fair Hope everyone has a good weekend.  I'm sticking to shakes and yogurt, so far so good.  Hoping for lighter SE's this second time around following FEC#2.  Was able to work all day Friday; water and exercise seem to be the key.  Of course, my child is 18 and a huge help.  Don't think I could handle being a mom to little ones AND work.

      "Content": "Feb 7, 2011 03:01PM - edited Feb 7, 2011 03:06PM by UTMom2014 Hi all, just back from 3 1/2 days at the hospital.  Not good news, but first: JulieH:Love the new \"look\"!  We could be twins except my scalp has a few traces of hair left on it:D Ck-Moma:What a bad break, flu following that awful storm, No FAIR!  Hope nothing like that happens again. SherryHuttrs/Webu/Tidenott: I'm for telling family members, especially teenagers.  This is a life-changing situation expecially at that age.  When my daughter went off to UnivTX/Austin last Fall, I thought I would die from missing her and from how suddenly she had such little time for me.  She loves the city, college social events, friends and all that independence.  While she held her own academically, she doesn't yet have the focus she needs to do better.  When I gave her my news and asked she come home this semester b/c I needed her, it was as hard on her as I expected.  The process helped her turn the corner.  It's settled her down so much, she's so worried and has come through when things get tough for me with flying colors.  So Sherry tell you daughter in whatever way works best, it will make a huge difference for her.  I tell mine how she'll always be glad she did this, esp when she's more mature.  Everyone is really proud of how she's risen to the occasion.  Tidenott, I'm so sorry for your loss and just have no words because I can't imagine anything tougher, even this awful cancer.  Webu: I am really happy things turned around with your daughter:D MaryMeg:Happy Belated Birthday!  I'm so glad it was so lovely for you.  We need those joyous moments now more than ever:D bdavis:Have you tried jojoba oil; I hear that's good for itchy scalp.  Mine was mostly sore as it fell off. Now it's almost gone and the soreness has eased up a lot. SunflowerE152:Thanks for the cotton cap tip.  We are mostly super hot and humid down here in South Texas so that is definitely good to know.  I will be trying that one out sooner than I'd like:D  Our winters last all of five minutes, though yes, this year has been unusually cold, brrrrrr. ScienceGirl:I'm with you about a tougher #2 and like you I really dread #3.  I hope you do better! Here's my top five things I learned after this hospitalization.  Though I don't wish this combo on anyone, it may be useful to know. 1.Neulasta does not prevent WBC from dropping.  I learned some people take it weekly; don't know if my dr. will give me that.  Went in at .05, just 8 days following chemo#2.  It's part of that State of Nadir, the 7-10 days following chemo when counts can go off a cliff. 2.Low red counts are life threatening; take temperature when feeling extreme fatigue.  Mine dropped to 7.5; 9 is normal.  I felt like a truck had run over me Thurs after work and thought it was related to stopping the Claritin 5 days following Neulasta as recommended. Had near screaming-point back pain, tiredness, headache, and just not feeling well.  Temperature at noon when I gave up trying to recover strength (after staying in bed Friday) was 102.3.  Rec'd blood transfusion right away; came up to 9.  Dr's explained organs must have oxygen provided by the reds so it really was critical to get attention right away. 3.Avoid fresh fruits and veggies.  I'm not allowed my raw veggie juices until I get done with next two FEC's.  The microbes can do real damage when counts are low and I'm sick to death of the hospital.  I hate to give up raw veggies, but this is too important.  I can live on cooked for the next 8 weeks. 4.Avoid crowds, sick people and practice good hygiene.  This is a toughie, I get stir crazy; my outings are walks in the neighborhood.  I still visit my dad at his nursing home but only once a week now and only outside in the patio when weather permits.  I'm terrified of going in that building now. 5.Work and exercise did not cause any of this.  After going over all possible things I could do to prevent this in the future, all of the doctors said this would have happened even if I'd stayed in bed and never gotten in any exercise.  Chemo kills both bad and good cells.  We all cope differently with the effects and this is mine.  There are no guarantee's I won't be there again after #'s 3, and 4.  On the bright side, Phase 2 for me is 12 weekly Taxol.  This is not expected to happen through those, though I might need Nupogens in between sometimes.  I need to get through this phase before I can think about any of that at this point. This group continues to be a huge difference in my life.  Your wisdom, wit, strength and inspiration are really important to me.  Be well; sending out lots  of cyber {{{{{{hugs}}}}}} ! ",

As always, so grateful for this thread; just read the conversation here regarding scans which I thought were required.  I do hear there are dangers of doing more scans than necessary.  You guys are making me see that they may not be needed, though I had a lumpectomy, so I will be asking my onco about that.  Feeling not so great still so switching to 1/2 days at work starting tomorrow.  I'm hoping to get a bit more rest, and how can that be bad?  My husband, who has been great through all this, is asking me to stop work completely, but I'm having a hard time \"giving in\" to cancer to that degree. What I read about the hard time many have towards the end of Taxol makes me think I may well expect to be home full time, at least at the end of this.  Again, so happy for everyone wrapping up this leg of the journey! Hugs to all:D ",

May all our rewards for having undergone this path be just as long-lasting and positive.",
