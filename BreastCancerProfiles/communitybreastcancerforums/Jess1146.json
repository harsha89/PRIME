And a couple 3-4 mm nodules.there is diffuse segmental enhancement in a linear distribution that extends from 1/2cm from nipple to 7 cm posteriorly towards chest wall.suggestive of diffuse  extensive ductal carcinoma.... Left auxiliary nodes are enlarged and pathologic in addition there is an interpectoralis lymph node identified which has a focal irregular nodule at one end and is suggestive of metastatic disease.

Biopsy results will probably be back tomorrow. Scheduled for a PET scan on Friday. Researching IBC and it's pretty scary! How does everyone feel about clinical trials versus contemporary treatments?",

PET scan showed several spots behind lungs that could be early spreading or just inflammation. Also showed a spot on cervix!!! Went to GYN today and found out its cervical cancer. Dr does not think the two are related. Really?!?!? They want to treat breast cancer first with chemo then do a mastectomy and hysterectomy at the same time then do radiation on a pectoralis lymph node. Dr says he can cure it but it all sounds really bad to me.  Does anyone have experience with two cancers at the same time??",
