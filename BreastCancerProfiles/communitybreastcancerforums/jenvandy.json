I recently decided to have my very first (baseline) mammogram after two women I know ,one a year younger than me and one a year or two older, were diagnosed with breast cancer stage 3 and stage 2 respectively. I totally anticpated just going in, getting a baseline, and then leaving until next year. Boy was I wrong. After the inititial pictures, I was called back in just a few minutes later for magnified pictures. Then just a little while longer I was told the Dr. wanted to see me. Apparently they found an area of tightly clustered calcifications(BIRAD4) and since I had no other films to compare them to, Biopsy was recommended. I had my biopsy two weeks later which was this past Wednesday 1/19/11. The procedure wasn't too bad at all, but certainly not pain free like I had heard. I  was told to take it easy for 24 hours, but could resume normal activity after that. Well, I guess I am a big baby, which suprises me because I have a very high tolerance for pain, but that seems way too soon for me. I am police officer and the mere thought of putting on a bullet proof vest on even two days later made me cringe. Anyway, so now here I sit, waiting for results. I have done a ton of research and know that a majority (like80%) are benign, but some women have to make up the othe 20%. I do not get a good feeling. This may just be because I am a sceptic by nature(my job does that to you) but I just feel something is not right. With that said, I do have a few questions;(1) How many people have had the radiologist say it was a good chance of being benign and then find out it wasn't? I mean if the chances were that good you wouln't need a biobsy anyway and(2)how many were find on your very first Mammo. I have absolutley no lumps which is what I always associated with cancer, and no other signs of BC what so ever. And finally(3) who many who were diagnosed with cancer from just microcalcs ended up having anything more than DCIS. thank you in advance for any input. I won't know until at least Monday since it is now the weekend and Im really ready to know one way or the other. Log in to post a reply",

I have a follow up in 6 months and I'm hoping it goes much smoother than my very first mammogram. Good luck ladies, I will continue to pray for all of you.",
