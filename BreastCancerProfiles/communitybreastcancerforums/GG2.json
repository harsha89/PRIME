I saw my MO and she put in another referral to the lymphedema therapist ( I saw the therapist last year when this first showed up. ) The MO said the therapist and/or the nurse navigator will know what forms need to be filled out etc. If it's the same therapist (which is most likely) she's all for bandaging, but not for pumps. Maybe she'll like the idea of a night sleeve. Kicks, is that what you meant by \"LET\"",

I did check the link you gave and it seems to me that the study will cover night time compression which I think I already have with the Solaris Tribute sleeve. It also appeared that the trial locations were limited to Canada (I live in US - Philadelphia, PA.) It sure is great to see trials like this as I have come to believe night compression and pumps should be the standard, not the exception in LE treatment. Good for you being 6 years out and with no more than \"hiccups\". Remain cautious with your right arm, however. \"We know not the day nor the hour . . .",
