While on the A/C I developed a dry cough that just will not quit, and my heart rate is elevated at 96 beats per minute. Normally, it's about 72; I often run 35-45 miles per week and am now having trouble going over 1/4 mile without stopping to rest. Is this normal? What's causing the dry cough and the elevated pulse rate? Any information would be greatly appreciated, as my oncologist doesn't seem concerned about it, but I am! slm Dx 8/10/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 10/14 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Is it unusual to feel a little depressed? I'm starting Arimidex as soon as I get my prescription filled. Does anyone have experience with that? What should I expect? I had the ovaries out three weeks ago and am glad to be done with that. You'll find that the easiest thing you have done yet, way easier than mastectomy, chemo, and even radiation! Sandy",
