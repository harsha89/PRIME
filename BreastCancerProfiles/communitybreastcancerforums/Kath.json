Lymphedema was stage 1 before 2005 and hurting but have been trying to keep it bay since..the specialist in area moved and wasnt able to see anyone so took it on myself to wear my sleve and gauntlet. Here is my delimna (sp?) im R handed and its my R arm. every job i do that im qualified for is either office / typing or physical work and all my jobs i have had since are causing severe pain and swelling. today i had to leave work after cutting a pineapple and hurting so much couldnt move arm. cant find a job where i dont have to use my arm or hand. I have had 4 jobs this year so far and had to leave them all because of it..hubby wants me on disability but im only 41 and cant sit home alone all the time. I lost my breasts to cancer...i cant become disabled too. Still i need to work for financial reasons. Any ideas? Thanks so much Kath Dx 6/13/2002, DCIS, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/14 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
