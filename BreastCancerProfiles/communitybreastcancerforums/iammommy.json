In walks the radiologist, and without even making eye contact said something like \"You need a biopsy. Time to get this out while it's still so small. It's time.\" I was so stunned by his lack of compassion, (and the news I needed a biopsy)I didn't even ask anything. Then all he said was \"You need to see the breast surgeon for any questions.\" Is this typical?? When he walked out I started crying and the U/S tech just said I'm sorry. Sorry what? Sorry I was upset? Or sorry that this IS cancer? Can they tell right from the diag. mammo and U/S that it IS cancer for sure. I think icky radiologist might have said a biopsy is the only way to know for sure. But I had shut down by then. I'm waiting to hear from my gyn. She is a sweetheart, and I'm hoping she can fax me the report.  Honestly, I can't take this stress and I'm not even diagnosed yet. I already had a total abdominal hysterectomy this past September. I know that so many women here have had things much worse than I do, and I ffeel like a baby, but I'm a mess.   Thanks for listening. Diagnosed 4/13/11 with LCIS; PBMX 5/4/11 Log in to post a reply",

She's not convinced it is cancer but the biopsy will tell. I am going to have a wonderful surgeon, and my consult for the stereo. biopsy is April 14th. She told me NOT to let my imagination run away with me. Easier said than done. Anyway, Passover is coming and I need to start cleaning! That will keep me busy for sure.

(Diag. mammo and U/S pictures and report) I relaxed a little, still knowing it will take the biopsy to confirm this. Saw the breast surgeon yesterday. Really nice and compassionate woman. Anyway, she couldn't feel anything anywhere, and did say that the mass (very small:her words) should be biopsied and she will take it out at the same time. I asked what the chances are that it's cancer adn she said her best guess would be 40%. I almost started crying because I wanted her to say like 10-20%. She said the mass is not \"ugly\" like most cancers are, not spiculated, and very small, and I really had no reason to be scared. That IF it is cancer it is very small and very early. So, why can't I take her reassurance to heart? I am scared. Very scared. And I feel guilty because some of the women here have it SO much worse than this. But what if?? I have a child with autism. I need to be here a loooooong time. He's only 12 and I am 56. I'm sorry for compalining. But how do docs get these odds anyway? Why didn't she say the standard 80% of lumps are benign? Why 40% chance of benign? And opn the report, what does \"inconclusive\" mean? OK, I'll stop bellyaching now. I'm just so scared. She said it would take about 2 days for the pathology report, maybe less. Please send me positive thoughts and prayers. Nan Diagnosed 4/13/11 with LCIS; PBMX 5/4/11 Log in to post a reply",
