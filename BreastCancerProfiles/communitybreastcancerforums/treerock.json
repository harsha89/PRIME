So I was being hopeful that it was another issue. Perhaps a little denial, but after years and years of getting lumps checked and coming out benign, and after being as preventive as possible- in the end DNA is DNA. Thankful they know more about BRAC 1 then they did years ago. And it's a good reminder not to let myself get wrapped up in things that I did (like drink soda) that I know that isn't really healthy anyway. Thanks for your response. :)",

I also think that if they are going to let folk become preventive then when asked to do more helpful type follow up should also be expected. I felt that what I got were people acting like they understood, but didn't really understand the need for somethings were greater than what some who don't have the mutations or have been preventive needed. So essentially because I don't have 98% + breast tissue anymore, ultrasounds would be a lot more realistic on the surrounding areas including armpits and collar bones. Allowing Women in this situation to say- I think I need a ultrasound say every 6-12 months on these areas, with recurring cancer body scans would be extremely helpful. It seems that a lot of health providers like to repeat the standards and understand tests are critical, but it's like they don't really listen to what your saying about preventive- I had to go to urgent care because the regular Dr. and Appt. Nurses only seem to be able to do the standard , Mammogram first, then ultra sound, then mri- this is protocol. Not to mention then they make the Mammogram appt. for likes 2 weeks in the future, no sense of urgency. Thanks for the information and gentle hugs- I will keep plugging along. :)  ",

      "Content": "treerock wrote: So 5 years ago when I turned 50 I got tested for the BRAC 1 mutation , and it came back positive, since my Mother died of breast cancer @ 32 years I decided I would be preventive, had a lot of other reasons to consider a DBL. Mast. besides. So the last 5 years have been great, a lot less worry about breast cancer until recently. Had reconstruction, but their is still about a 5% chance to get cancer, had a lump between the breast and armpit area, thought it was just scar tissue, waited a short time since it was Christmas thought I'll get this checked in the new year, January 21st the lump that I was gonna get checked more than dbl in size like over nite. Go that day to get checked-boom positive breast cancer Stage 2 grade 3. Still trying to understand what that means, this wasn't subpose to happen like this. I feel like I waited too long as I knew I had a lump, but I've had lots of lumps, cysts, benign tumors, scar tissue, fibroid's etc... I'm the past, the last 5 years I haven't had any of that, I thought for sure this had to be scar tissure or  a blocked lymph node due to drinking soda or to strong of deodorant- any way here I am now having to wait til' the 5th of Feb. for a pathology report, the tumor was cut out on Monday the 25th have a drain, not back to work...My life has gone from fine to severe in a what seems like 60 seconds... anyone have anything for me to think about????

I was really shocked how quickly this lump jumped and understanding it's the nature of the beast helps. I think that's why I feel somewhat anxious in waiting til' the 5th to see the Oncologist, I'm hoping they got all of it last week during the surgery but understand the need to get the chemo to kill it the rest of the way, hoping it isn't to far along. My Mother died quite young and quickly, and that seems to be like a recurring nightmare in some respects. I sure hope with each one of us particularly the mutation genes they can find more successful options, I have several nieces as well two young grandgirls that I hope when they get to an age they can have more confidence in this situation. Have a good nite and God bless.
