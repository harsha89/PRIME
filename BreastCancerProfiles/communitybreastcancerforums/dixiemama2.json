Chemo, Tamoxifen and currently started Radiation. I am totally upset and scared over the possibility that my BC has now metastasized to femur, pelvis, vertebral column and sternum.  As of right now I have had x-rays, CT's, MRI's, bone scans and as of last week a PET scan (which my oncologist and radiation oncologist have differing opinions on what should be done next to verify Dx). One feels that we should do bone biopsies to verify and the other has ordered addition scans and x-rays). Regardless, I still don't know if I have mets or if some other process going on.  The bone pain in LS spine, pelvis and femurs is awful and keeps me from getting around and doing a lot of things that I enjoy.  I have battled degenerative joint disease since 1991 and blood clots in my leg since 2004, so I just thought that the increased pain was associated with one of those. Just for informational purposes, how were your mets diagnosed and verified? Was there such a question about whether you had mets or not? Thanks, Karen",
