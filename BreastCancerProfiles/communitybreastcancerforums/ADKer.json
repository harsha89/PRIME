A few get awful reviews.  I realize that reviews aren't always what they seem, but they are a little disconcerting since we have no personal recommendations. So here's my question -- how do we find a good oncologist? At this point, it looks like her cancer is stage II, so I don't know that she needs to endure the drive to Northwestern to find a good doctor.  I know there MUST be one in Central DuPage Hospital!  Or even Good Samaritan. Can anyone help with this?  BTW, I apologize if I've already broken a forum rule about posting.  I have never done this before, and don't know the ropes yet! Log in to post a reply",
