Started working with a new trainer as my other guy is now got 2 college teaching gigs along with all his other stuff so really not time for the PT stuff.  I like the new gal but she had me doing some things to help my balance and dang if the back did not like it!  I get sharp zings like someone is poking a knife in my back.  Decided to hold off on the PT for now and work on the things they have shown me to do. Carol, good luck on the shots and sure hope they do the thing for you.",

It definitly is a worthwhile program and I would advise anyone who does not have a gym membership, to look into it.  I went thinking they might know something about lymphe but not at this gym. You are right on the networking though, thanks for the thought.  I am reallizing that if I wanted to become a lymphe massage person, I would need to likely go to a 2 year college for OT first and then the LANA training if I wanted to be able to accept insurance.  More things to think about~~ ",

Now I need to behave on the holiday weekend and not overdo things!",

I read something last night on line that has me ready to call my onco this morning.  It said that weakness in the legs can be a side effect of aromasin.  My legs have become noticably weaker in the last 5 years dispite all my gym workout but I never linked it to the dumb pill.  Maybe it is not all me?  I am due to end the pill the end of Dec so perhaps my doc will agree we can stop now?  Or maybe I just will and then discuss with her on my next visit. At my last visit to onco, I asked when I could stop the AL, she asked if I had any side effects and I said no as I did not relate the leg weakness at the time.  It is so close to the end of the 5 years that hoping doc will agree. ",

Sorry the knee is still complaining and hope you can slowly get it back where you want it to be.  I have had some bad periods where I could not work out but know you will get back into it. Still doing my gym with a combo of stuff.  My gym has a great pool and I recently started walking in the lanes to help my balance issues.  Not easy but it is helping.  Interesting as another woman who has seen me in my lap swimming, she has signed up for swim lessens and told the trainer she wants to swim like me! Not that I am great but sort of slow and steady.  She is 66 and just wanted to add it to her aqua, spin and other stuff!",

Working towards getting back into spin as had not been doing  lately so working up to it by pushing myself on the stationary bike.  How are you doing?",

They adjusted the taxol when i told them, I can drive but do not do long drives or trips anymore. I missed out on my uncles 90 birthday party as i was worried about driving. What has helped me hugely is the pt at the hospital and using the rollator to get around the house. The rollator is different from a walker but if your doc oks it, medicare will cover cost. I did see them in my walgreens for about 60 0r 70 dollars. My walking has improved immensely when i got the rollator. It helps me to walk around the house without fear of falling, and i had fallen 3 times! The rollator allows me to carry my coffee in the morning or to fold my wash and help me get the stuff upstairs. There is a little sort of table to it, so I can move my stuff. When are you starting pt? According to my pt gal i have weak ankles so she gave me stuff to help me strengthen them. Like i stand on my toes while holding on to the kitchen counter or when brushing my teeth! I actually knew my ankles were weak and used to twist my ankles often.. keep me posted on your progress. Oh yeah, i did pt once a week so i could practice in between. They initially wanted me to do it 3 times a week.",

They initially seemed to suggest up to 3 days a week but i said i wanted to do 1 day each week so i could practice in between. They had no problem with that. Dont be afraid, i sent a message to management telling them how great the team was ,is your therapy being done at your hospital or a private center..,.? Ive done both. They will not expect you to do more than you are able or safe. Good luck and let me know how it goes Just tell the therapists how you feel and that uou just want to walk better!
