I called yesterday and the results weren't back yet however the nurse let me know the doctor was \"very concerned\" and once the test results came in they will want me to come in to discuss possible surgery and options. Called back today and the results are Still not back...tomorrow will be 3 days when the nurse that did the biopsy said \"you should have your results by Wednesday at the very latest; possibly even tomorrow\"......I'm scared and wondering why the results are taking longer than normal. Should I be concerned and worried?",

I found the tiny lump exactly a year ago and the original Radiologist blew it off as nothing however one of the nurses pulled me aside as I was leaving and said I should get a 2nd opinion; I thank God for that Nurse!! I then found my oncologist that I love and now here we are. My daughter isn't handling it very well and very scared and that is hard for me as I am trying to be positive in I KNOW I will beat this! It's gonna suck and I'm going to have bad days, however I have always been a Survivor and I Will Survive BC!! I will welcome the details/specifics on Monday so we have a plan of action. And this might sound odd, however if there was a time for this to happen the timing is almost eerie...I have the most incredible support system of friends and family and work family; I have an amazing man in my life that will be my strength when I faulter; I have great insurance and doctors and I have planned well for a situation as this. God is with me and Angels on both shoulders!! I will beat this!!!  This site is a blessing and I wish you all luck and blessings!! ",

I know a day will come when this is behind me and I can say I fought, I won and survived; right now I bounce between anger, fear, pain and sadness.

I have heard many different opinions on the cold caps;I would be willing to at least initially try to keep my hair if at all possible. I have long thick hair so would it make sense to cut it short in the beginning? And what cold caps are the best? I am starting a journal more for myself and the ability to write what maybe I cant put into words or have no one to listen to; something to look back at once this nightmare is over to see how even through the fear and confusion, I won! I beat this evil monster called cancer....and to maybe help someone just beginning their struggle too as you ladies have done for me! God Bless You All!! Lara",

On my out one of the nurses pulled me to the side and told me to please get a 2nd opinion....thank God for her! I found a wonderful breast surgeon/oncologist that did a sonogram and he thought cancer was unlikely however let's look again in 6 months..... October 16th, I knew in my gut, and after the sonogram the head radiologist came in and said, \"I don't like how it looks, it's grown and it's different\";she immediately ordered a core-biopsy and on Oct. 21st I was diagnosed with breast cancer. After that the days and weeks became a blur...on Nov. 13th I had a double mastectomy, lat flap and reconstructive in 1 surgery lasting 11 & 1/2 hours long. I'm 46; my grandmother was 49 when she was diagnosed and i watched her wither away and die; I know I will beat this but I am so scared! I've always been so strong and tough but this has humbled me and brought me to my knees. I am not one to complain or whine but God what I'd do to have my life back before the cancer!! Every time my doctors look at the stitches and bandages they rave about how well I'm doing...and all I see are' Frankenboobies\"! Sometimes that makes me laugh, sometimes not so much. I'm surrounded by family and my boyfriend is incredibly supportive and loving; it's when I'm alone that I allow myself to break for a moment and let myself be angry and hurt and cry!! I get my last drain out tomorrow and then they will schedule me with another oncologist on this team to discuss treatment; 6-8- rounds of chemo and radiation since they also found the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes. I hate the idea of losing my hair as silly as that sounds at this point, but it's always been somewhat of my security blanket as I have a port wine stain birthmark on the right side of my face. I felt this was the best place to share my feelings and fears as I am hoping to hear from others that have already been here and survived and are either going through it with me or on the other side....what should I expect? What vitamins or food should I take/eat to keep me strong. The pain from the nerves coming back to life on my left side where they took all the lymph nodes and did the lat flap can be excruciating!! God bless all of you in your fight; cancer just plain sucks!!
