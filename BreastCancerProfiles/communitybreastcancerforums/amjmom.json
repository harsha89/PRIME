I wish I could remember if she called it 'lipoma' or not... they said it appeared smooth edged on the ultrasound, which was good. I don't know.. I think I want it out of there though... just in case. Thanks for your opinions :)",

      "Content": "amjmom wrote: Hi everyone, I was looking for some opinions. My mother was 46 when diagnosed with very aggressive ER- breast cancer. What she went through was horrendous, but she is now doing well. I am now 33, and have been followed actively since her diagnosis. I have had a good size lump in one of my breasts at the 10 o'clock position for at least a year..Mammogram and ultrasound show nothing, show it to be a fatty lump..(i know there was another word she used for it, but I don't remember). Recent MRI came back fine, but they want me to repeat in 6 mos due to 'artifact'...  My mother says the lump doesn't belong there, get it out. The Dr. says its up to me. Even mentioned that if I wanted, it could be taken out in the office (?!?) (Has anyone done that??) Just looking for opinions....similar stories Is it stupid to have it removed? Can they be 100% sure it's ok without taking it out?   I have 3 small children, and just worried.. Thanks for any help you can offer. Log in to post a reply",
