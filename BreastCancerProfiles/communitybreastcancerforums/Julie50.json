Oh that smell yes I have it on the left side (same side as my surgery) I hate that smell. I had (2)nodes removed.  It all started about three weeks ago, 1st my thumb swelled then my hand, went to the ER as the pain was awful, it went away, he said I pulled something either in my neck etc. All the swelling is gone.  But the pain is back in my neck, arm, hand. All the same side.  I see my Rad Onco for my two week check-up but I was not fond of him, each time I said I felt something funny he would always and I mean always say \"NORMAL\".... I see my Onco on the 6th to start my pill from H@## as I call it...LOL  and I will ask about all this pain.  I never had a bone scar or anything yet.  I think I will demand one just to play safe. My Lump was on May 24th and I'm telling you I have not felt the same since.  But then I also have a lot of stress in my life at the moment. Just had to put my mom into long term care as I could not care for her any longer so I'm up at the nusring home a lot.   Then my older sister (56) passed away on Father's Day, went to bed and never woke up, they said she had a bad heart, never sick, etc worked for United for the past 18 years, so I'm still trying hard to process her death... So who knows with this old body of mine...LOL  Good thing is me and my Husband are going away this week for 3 LONG days to a Bed and Breakfast up in Lake Geneve Wi, can't wait to get re-connect with him.... Again, thank you so much for helping me with my question. Have a great Sunday Julie",

Short story:  Last night I was woken up at 2:00am to this cold wind on my body, then I heard my sister upstairs (she passed away on fathers day in here sleep at 56, never sick, it was her heart) so I went up stairs and of course she was not there.  Went outside and there she was (an image of her sitting on the bench) it was so calming for me...So her and I had this great conversation..:) I hope everyone has a peaceful Sunday.  I'm 2 weeks done 5 more to go....

I'm changing Onco this month, I just don't like the man I see, I had all those tests done and had to call over 4 times to get the results, that is BS if you ask me, then when I did call the nurse said \"ALL LOOKS NORMAL\" at that point I just hung up the phone... I saw my family Dr. yesterday and told him I tried the pill from hell \"A\" and thought I was dying a slow death for a week, he said I was right in tossing it out. He got me a new ONco that he loves and my surgen loves her also, he said to keep taking the DIM as he has heard good reports from it, it said going \"NATURAL\" is ok until I meet with the new Onco on the 19th.  I cured my lyme doing natural... Chicago-CONGRATS on the clean mamo, that hard to be music to your ears... Sonia-Have a great time, you will enjoy I'm sure of it..:) I have tried changing my eating habbits at the moment just not working for me.  Jim quit smoking day 7, I'm so proud of him, I'm trying, I'm down to 4 a day....Hopefully next week NONE... We are going back to the Bed and Breakfast on the 8&9 of Dec for a little \"get a way\" we were going to go to St. Thomas but I told him lets wait until next year, I don't want to ruin the trip crying all day long... Other than that doing ok, the therpist that works on my arm is also working on my breast, WOW what a difference it has made for me.  The pains are almost gone, the tight feeling and itching, it has been a hugh help.   Today I start on my mom's room I decided to pack up a lot of it and save it for a nice winter day to go through it.  She had so many angels and this \"Prayer Jar\" I looked at all her prayers, and each one she wrote she always said \"Thank you god\", it was really cute.  So many prayers for me in her jar, I will keep them forever.  The last prayer I read was \"Dear Lord if you can't fix me then please take me home\", I guess he answered that one for my mom...Oh how I miss her my friends.... Ok, off to get ready for my little part time job, I hope everyone has a great weekend, stay warm, cold here in Chicago.. Thank you for asking if I was \"OK\" that means the world to me, you have no idea. Many hugs to each of you Julie",

She has a COLD and thinks she is dying....I hope and pray she never has to walk in my shoes.... Well ladies at least we have each-other, I thank God each day for that. Sleep well everyone.....Going to have a cup of tea and hit the hay, been a long day. Hugs to all Julie",

Hey ladies go to www.cancermath.com  Very cool.  I went there and it said if I take the pill from hell it adds TWO years to my life...big deal....I'm still trying to decide what to do on this I have until Wed. Yup arm pain is awful, plus my knee started, but I also have lyme and I know when under stress my knee will start to hurt that was the 1st sign something was wrong 3 years ago, then I found the tick, and it was a total mess from that point forward.  So I'm hoping the knee pain is from my lyme.  Arm pain well that is awful and I will not leave his office until he does something about it. I've made a appointment with my family Dr. (been seeing him for over 10 years) and he is wonderful, he will not MESS around with this or say its \"NORMAL\" I can't take the pain much longer...Even my wine did not help last night..LOL Donna-Have a safe trip and enjoy. Ok write more later doggies are brarking up a storm outside and its only 7:00am",

I guess I should also look into the flu shot, I just hate getting something I have never gotten in my life. I'm lucky to take an aspirin...LOL Brenda-Have a great time in the mountains, take some photos for us... Yes can't wait to get away for two days, it will be nice to just \"NOT THINK\". Today I got a lot done and found so many photos my mom had that I never saw, sat on the floor in her bedroom and keep looking at them, brought back wonderful memories of my childhood.

I think my mind is out of control, every ache I feel I think \"CRAP ITS BACK\" I try hard not to think this way, but BC changed my way of thinking.  Like with this pain in the arm and neck, I'm think \"IT went to my bones\", I have to stop this....But its hard.... Jim and I leave next week for 3 days to the bed and breakfast can't wait to re-connect with my husband.  Bought some new outfits, etc, hopefully he will like them...LOL I decided to hold off on getting a full time job until the 1st of the year if I can, my body feels so beat up and I'm so tired lately, I was told that this could happen after Rad stops, anyone else have this problem?????  So I will keep working my 1.5 hours per day....But then I also see my mom each day at the nursing home for a few hours, that is a job in itself... Ok, time for coffee and laundry.  Have a wonderful day Ladies. p.s. I start my pill Oct 6th..:( Hugs Julie",

Brenda-Thank you for the info on the drug you are on, Dr. called me last night and my chol is high and have to start some pill but he wants to wait as I'm starting the pill from hell this week and I have so many reactions he does not want me to start two new pills at one time. My Vit. D is also low so he is giving me a Vit. D pill I take once a week for 12 weeks. I'm so sorry to hear about your Mom, Brenda I know the feeling oh so well. I had to put my mom into a nursing home but still I'm called 3-4 times per day as she is really sick at the moment with the flu/cold which in turn can kill my mom as she has COPD, CHF, you name it she has it, she called me last night at 9:00 telling me to take the \"Turkey out of the oven\"..hummmmm  I also am the only one as my other sister lives in Devnver which does me no good and my other sister that lived closed died in June.  I know how you feel tryting to care for a parent alone.  Big hug to you. Donna, I agree \"no news is good news\", but the waiting can drive you to drink, I know the feeling, hang in there hopefully today you will hear something, if not CALL sometimes they get the results and if \"NORMAL\" they forget to call you...Sorry for the word \"Normal\" but in this case it would be a wonderful word to hear... No my husband is not a Police Office (Thank god) he runs the 911 center for the past 19 years, that alone is a lot of stress.   Then he told me he is going to see his mom and dad in two weeks for a week, then from there to Springfield for a conference so he will be gone 10-15 days, :( I hate when he is gone so long, but someone has to work in this family...LOL My little part time job is ok, but I come home so tired as after I leave there I have to go see mom for a few hours and that is so trying at times as lately she does not even know me, yesterday she keep thinking I was my sister \"SUE\" who just died, breaks my heart, that said its the infection causing this, I hope so.  I wish God would hear my prayers and take my mom home, this is no life for her...She deserves to be at peace with my sister. Bailey-I fully agree about feeling \"OLD\" and I have not even started the pill from \"HELL\" yet, I think cancer has aged us all...:( So question, are we all in \"remission\" is that the word we are to use when we are asked????  Ok, time to start my day, Onco, work, mom, then home sweet home.

It gives me great comfort that Jim and I were with my mom when she went home to Sue and God. Its been a long and hard road the past few years for my mom and the passing of my Sister Sue in June destroyed my mothers heart. Sue Died on June 20, 2010 and my mom October 21, 2010. On Wed my mom fell and broke her hip, due to her kidneys failing they could not do surgery. At noon yesterday we decided to call in Hospice they were OUTSTANDING. They transferred my mom to a private room with a bed for me to sleep in (As I was not leaving) they did so much for Jim and I, they were so kind and respected everything Jim, I and my family wanted for my mom. Luke, Matt and my cousin Ellen came and saw her (My mom starting at noon) never woke up, as they had her drugged due to the pain and with in hours I believe she went into a coma. She received so many phone calls and with each call I would put the phone up to her ear and I could see her eyes move, I know she could hear each person that called to say \"Good-by\". I was told yesterday that the last thing to go is the hearing, so I know my mom knew I was with her while she went home to God. My family has been through so much this year, my breast cancer, then Sue, Mom going into a nursing home, I ask all of you please pray for me and my family, are hearts are so broken. I did not just lose my mother I also lost my best friend, I am so lucky for the mother I had, she was a wonderful, loving mother and I will miss her so much. I don't think my life will every be the same. Everyone would say \"Caring for you mom has to be so hard\", yes it was hard, but it also was rewarding and I thank God each day for the job he gave me. My mother brought me into this world and I was there holding her hand while god took her home. Love Julie",

But yes the waiting can tend to drive you to drink... Job went ok, came home very tired, but then I have this cold from hell.  My mom is really sick and my sister just came out of the hospital (she lives in Devner).  We just need this year to end on a good note, not happening... Kim-I saw my Rad Onc last week for my two week check up, waste of time and money if you ask me, My Medical Onc checks me each time I go and I trust him more then the \"NORMAL JERK\". My breast is all healed and looks great, I do itch from time to time and have a lump where the cut is and is freaking me out big time, but I see the surgon today and will address this also.  My most pain is in my arm and hand.... Kim-How is the \"T\" pill going??? I start some pill tomrorow with the \"A\" not sure the name until tomorrow....yikes and Kim its only 42 outside this AM, heat is on again---Did I tell you I HATE WINTER...LOL Ok, off to the job, nursing home, Dr. LONG day ahead of me.  Oh then a wake, A cop Jim works with 41 shot himself a few days ago, why, you just have to ask \"why\"...So sad. Many hugs my friends Julie",

Jim and I were at my sisters house yesterday, it felt so good to be with my sister Beth and Dad.  I finally got to see my sisters Urn, I felt so close to her yesterday. My house is so empty, I feel at such lose at the moment.  All I do is walk around crying. A day has not gone by in years that I have not spoken to my mom 5-10 times per day.   I miss my mom so much, my heart is broken, empty and numb. I still have not heard back from all my tests, hoping tomorrow I will.  I am taking a week off from my part time job, just need some alone time.  All my moms stuff is here at my house as she has lived with Jim and I for over a year, I finally had to close her bedroom door. Spendy-I had a total HYTS over 8 years ago, best thing I ever did.  I was back at work in 4 weeks and I had over 30 staples, etc.  The worse thing was being thrown into the change of life, but heck you fought BC you can fight the HF...:) I start my pill from HELL tomorrow....:( Ok time to have coffee.  Have a wonderful day everyone and thank you so much for all the e-mails. www.legacy.com/obituaries/chic... ",

Brenda I can't allow myself to let BC or anything else that has happened in my life the past 6 month rob me, there is still to much to live for. BC was hard, very hard, my mom and sisters death was something I still don't understand, but I know in my heart if I don't keep going I will go crazy. Each day I say to myself \"It could have been much worse my BC\" and I was very lucky to have it caught early on--So many people don't.
