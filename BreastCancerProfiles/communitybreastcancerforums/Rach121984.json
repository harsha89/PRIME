She said it was unlikely to be BC at my age etc etc but I can\u2019t help but worry. Since then, I have been checking my breasts 3/4 times a day (I know it\u2019s the stupidest thing to do) and found a couple more lumps!! I\u2019m having my ultrasound 5th December. It\u2019s so hard to just get on with everything not knowing what it is. Rachel xx",
