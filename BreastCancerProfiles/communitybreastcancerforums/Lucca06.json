It certainly didn't happen overnight but gradually over the next few months my mind stopped tormenting itself and thought about it less & less. The tougher place you are in physically (i.e.post ops) definitely affects the mental but once you feel well and can get busy doing things you love it gets easier.  You are still very much in the 'thick of it' as my breast care nurse said, it does take time but you will get there.  Just take one day at a time. In terms of positive nodes vs. micromets the answer is I don't know.  I think my immediate instinct was to google but then I decided it would not change anything and statistics are just that.  Try and focus on getting well and healthy which you do have control over.  The other thing my nurse used to say is 'be kind to yourself' which only now nearly 3 years later to I really understand what she meant.  Take care.",

I have just come back from a week skiing in France with my 2 children, thankfully they are now as in love with the sport as I have always been!! The picture is of me with them on Wednesday morning, our last day of a wonderful week with friends. Whilst they were at ski school in the morning I spent the 3 hours skiing powder snow, my idea of absolute heaven! I am a very keen skier having spent several years working in ski resorts in my 20s. What suddenly struck me afterwards was that 5 years ago to that day I was dealing with the side effects of my first chemo treatment which were hitting at full tilt. To be able to be doing what I did this week was a dream I used to shut my eyes and fixate on at my lowest points.....there were many. It seemed so impossible and to be honest I doubted I might ever ski again. So despite 9 chemos, 3 weeks of radio, 7 operations & too many other procedures to count with my lyphadema sleeve & glove on and ignoring the creaking joints from the Aromasin, there I was flying around in the powder snow feeling more alive and grateful than I ever have! For those in the midst, shut your eyes and imagine yourself in 5 years doing something you love..........you will get there too.
