    "Content": "HunterdonCtyMom wrote: It's been 8 years since I had DCIS, lumpectomy and radiation. Just a few days ago I felt a tugging sensation in my other breast and went to see my OBGYN to get it checked out. The Dr. said it feels like I have a cluster of cysts so I am going for a mammogram and ultrasound tomorrow. I am going through Perimenopause so I am hoping it's just cysts. I am so nervous and worried. Any positive thoughts and vibes would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
