I am a little nervous and unsure at this point.  I will say that I was pretty sure that I would do this cause I wanted to fight hard against this.  Until yesterday.....I had my teaching lesson and took my mom and fiance.  Needless to say they don't really want me to do this and can't understand why since I had a mastectomy to make sure I got rid of it all.  I was given the choice of lumpectomy too, but didn't want to wonder for the rest of my life.  I just wanted it gone. So now, I've been up since 3 a.m. and can't sleep. I keep going over things in my mind.  Am I doing the right thing.  I thought I was.  Now, their concerns are bothering me.  Ever since I was diagnosed, I have been so upbeat and positive. Nothing about it really bothered me or got me down.  But having to go thru chemo did hit me a little hard.  But I got over that hurdle.  Til yesterday.  Now I just don't know.  I've been reading posts for weeks now just to feel some sort of relief and to know what to expect.  It's hard to explain things to your family about why you chose to do what you do when they haven't really experienced it.  That's why I come on here multiple times a day to be with those who have been thru it, are going thru it and understand.  Yes I am scared.  For the first time since the diagnosis.  My fiance asked. \"Why do you want to do chemo?\"  I told him, \"No one wants to do chemo.\"  How do you get them to understand and continue to support your decision?",

Last Thursday I went for labs and hydration. All tests came back pretty good. My doctor said my platelets were a little below normal but nothing to be too worried about. I think hydration was ok but for a few days after I was not feeling so great. Don't know why.  But overall I'm doing good. In fact, I don't know how to sit still and relax. The things I've been doing around the house have been crazy. My fiance told me I need to slow down. LOL! He's always saying, \"Slown down slugger.\" I try, but it's not possible. I cut my hair on Monday in preparation for the hair loss. I went from the middle of my back to the nape of my neck. Everyone loves it. So do I. But I think I may go a little shorter. No signs of it falling out yet though. But I'm loving that I don't have to shave the legs. I did them a week and a half ago and no new growth. Yay!!! I have been having a lot of bone pain lately and daily headaches. It can get pretty irritating but I just go with the flow. Tomorrow I go for another hydration and then it's round 2 of AC the following Thursday. I'm nervous about that one. The first round didn't hit so bad. I did pretty good. So we'll see how it goes. Blessings to all the ladies. We are the strongest bunch of woman I know.",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2009 01:52PM - edited Jul 11, 2009 01:53PM by giggles124 Thank you o2bhealthy, I will definitely check that out.  I will be in this thread pretty regular to see updates and to update myself once I start chemo next Thursday. Eph3_12: Thank you so much for sharing with me.  I needed to hear that. I know he took the node for testing and it came back negative, which was a good thing.  None were involved.  But I do feel the same as you do.  I chose to have a mastectomy cause I wanted it gone and by whatever it took.  And that's the same way I look at chemo, if there was even a microscopic small bit of cancer that tried to \"hide\", I wanted to do what it took to make sure it was gone.  So chemo is my choice.  Kathy16: I haven't had the Oncotype DX test.  My doctor didn't order it.  He is more aggressive at making sure we do what's necessary to get rid of it.  For him, it's an insurance policy.  So I will only have four rounds of chemo.  By the way all, my mom did call me this morning after my post and told me she had been thinking about it this morning and is supporting this decision as well.  She looked at it from my point of view and my reasons for doing it. And she understands.  Good luck to everyone!  I'll keep updates of my progress.",

I did 100cc's today. I've been reading the posts and I'm drawing strength and courage from them.  It really helps to know there are others that are going thru what I am and can offer support.  Thank you ladies!! I'll write tomorrow and let you know how my first round of chemo went for me.  Wish me luck!! And good luck to those who are also waiting to get their first round.  We are all strong women.  We can handle this and everything else.",

Then I went up and they hooked up my IV with saline until the blood results came back.  They came back good so they ordered my meds.  They gave me pre-meds for nausea and a steroid in my IV.  After that, they hooked up a bag of Emend as well, to help with nausea.  Happy to say that I had no nausea whatsoever.  After that, I got the Adriamycin first.  They pushed it thru from two big syringes.  After that, they hooked up the Cytoxan.  All in all I was there for a couple hours or so. I had no SE's at all last night.  Took some Ambien and slept real well.  Matter of fact, my fiance said I snored alot last night.  LOL! Today I went in for my Neulasta shot.  It wasn't too bad.  Stung just a little bit but otherwise, it went well.  No SE's too much today.  A little nausea, but I took the meds they gave me and it went away.  I just feel a little tired sometimes, but other than that, I'm doing good.  I've been drinking lots of water and my mom just went to get me a banana-mango smoothie.  Yummmmm! LindaSueH-- Getting the TE's expanded didn't hurt too much.  They put in 120cc's during surgery.  I went in and could only take 80cc's the first time.  Since I didn't really feel any pain, I went for 100cc's the second time.  That one I felt!!  Around the the third or fourth day, it got a little painful.  My last time I went for 100cc's again, but didn't feel it too much except in one spot.  But it's all good for now.  Good luck to you when you go.  Only take as much pressure as you can stand.  Otherwise it will be painful later. Hugs to everyone!",
