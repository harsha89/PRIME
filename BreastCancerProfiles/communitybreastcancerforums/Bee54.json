We need extra prayers and good wishes for 2new1s, so she gets rid of her infection so she can go home from the hospital. TXBadboob I too would be so upset if I thought I was going to get my drains out and couldn't, so sorry, just keep looking forward to the day you do get them out, it will all the sudden feel so good and the pain is gone. I swear, they are the most painful thing about this surgery. Take care all, Bee samiam, we made it 5 weeks now, sure seems to have gone by fast, wish all the waiting at the first would have gone by this fast..lol..hope your doing fine",

Well, I went to  PS and first she talked to us about me getting my eyelids done at the same time as she puts in the implants, this is something I really want to do, the doc is going to try to get the insuance comp. to pay for it but they probably won't, they will say they are not bad enough and to wait till they are..oh poop..lol But good news is I think my DH is going to pay for it, he says I've been through so much that I deserve it....isn't he just the sweetest? ( or maybe he's tired of seeing my drooping eyelids...lol no really, he would never think like that). then we went in the room for my fill, she did the right one, put in another 100ccs, so total in right 350ccs, well when she got to the left, remember the pains I had in it? Seems my expander flipped over, so she couldn't put any in that one, it's still 250ccs, I'm lopsided now...lol. PS did try to flip it today, she worked on it for quite a while, but couldn't do it, so I go back next wed., hopefully it will flip on it's own this week but if not she's gonna try again and if that don't work, I have to have surgery, so she can flip it. She also said that she would catch it up on the fills while I was in surgery. And I thought that I was doing so good....lol Oh well, I don't think it's any big deal, specially if it doesn't slow everything down..lol I know what your thinking 2new1s, yes she said it could of been caused from lifting my DG too much ( thought I'd say it before you did...lol ) Other than that, we ate at the Cheesecake Factory and yes I ate my delicious lunch and then had a wonderful piece of cheese cake, carrot cake cheese cake, It is sooooo good, ( I need that like I need another hole in my head,,,lol) But I just couldn't pass it up....I'm sooooo weak when it comes to sweets !!!!! my560sel, I found in early june last year about mine and didn't make my mind up till Nov, then had 2 lumpectomies and then waited till Feb. this year for my bi-lateral masectomy, talk about being slow..lol I'm so bad about making my mind up on anything, so something this serious is even harder for me. Just try to make your mind up somewhat faster than I did, cause I just had DCIS and LCIS. i'll be praying for you,....Hugs to you, and to all my little buddies Everyone take care Bee",

Not much happening here, haven't been back to the PS, since she tried to flip my foob, the insurance is dragging their feet on giving the ok to go in and take the flipped expander out and put a new one in, don't know why. I did get good news, the insurance paid that 35,000 dollar bill, finally. I was holding my breath on that one. Now if they would ok this minor surgery to flip the ole foob, I could get going again and maybe this part of the journey would soon be over. 2new1s...my what a big foob you have..lol Mine have only 350 in non flipped foob and 250 in flipped foob, i should have already had at least 2 more fills by now,,,OH POOP...lol, makes me so mad, you might know that something would slow me down, oh well just part of life, I'll just find away to laugh it off.

She is so good to go have pictures taken, never fusses, just sits or whatever they want her to do. Needless to say that almost every picture turned out, that made it real hard to pick. I had to buy more than I planned to...lol just couldn't leave them there..lol. Then Sun., we went to my neices house, not only for Easter dinner, that was wonderful, I might add, we also had DG's 1st. B'day party. It  was so fun to watch her eat her own little cake, what a mess, at least Grandma Bee had enough sense to get her white cake, so it wasn't too bad..lol. DH talked to my insurance company Friday and they said that they had just sent a letter the day before saying that they will pay for my flipped foob surgery. I'm so happy, I want to get this show on the road. Should hear from my PS soon for the details, just hope it's soon.

I get undressed and put beautiful gown on, hat, those long white socks, I have an antibiotic iv in, I'm all ready to go, of course the PS is running late, about 45 minutes. She get's there and comes in to see me and mark my foob for where she  will make the incision. I make a joke and say that with my luck the expander flipped back and the other flipped over wrong..lol Well the doc decided to check the flipped foob out and lo and behold the expander had flipped back on it's own..lol She filled me, 150ccs in the flipped foob and just 50 in the other but they are both the same size now (400ccs), I think. So, I put my panties on and left...lol I was so happy, I just hated the thought of having another surgery. My DH and I just made a day of it, went to big antique store and looked around for along time, went to eat at a nice resturant, then headed west to Illinois to pick our DG's B'day/ easter pictures, they all turned out so great. We are very happy with them.Ended up going to Bath & Body so I could pick up somethings I need and some I didn't...lol We ended eating again before we went home, it was quite a long day. DD was at Greencastle at the Academic Bowl, competing for her school, so we had plenty of time to kill. Oh, one more thing that thrills me is, DD got invitated to join the National Honor Society, she is so happy, only 3 sophmores got invited. I'm very proud of her, good thing she took after her  dad, cause if it was mom, she'd be getting an award for good partying...lol 2new1s.....Sorry to hear about your trouble with your 16 year old son, my son is 26 and we are having alot of trouble with him, so I know how hard it can be and how everyone blames you, in my case I keep blaming me and DH get's so mad at me for doing that. He's such a good man. I will pray for you and your son tonight, I'm sure he will get it together soon. I wanted to thank all you ladies for your good wishes and prayers for my surgery, you all must of prayed so hard the foob just decided it better get back to were it belonged...lol Thanks 2new1s... Sorry to hear about your dad, will put him on my prayer list too. Hope everything is going better for him. Let us all know how he's doing. Sorry this is so long, guess I just had alot to say...lol Take care & hugs to all, Bee",

It has taken so long to get here, that I think I just thought of it as a dream, but now that it's this close grim reality is setting in. I always felt that I was such a strong person and have always handled things for everyone, but this has made me feel so weak and alone. (even though I have a wonderful, supportive and loving DH and DD) I have to go see a cardiologist today to make sure the ole ticker is alright before surgery. Just really getting tired of being messed with..lol Hugs to everyone, I'm so glad to be able to say what I feel on here, thanks for being there.                       Debbi5108 I'm from Indiana too, having my surgery in Indy, Feb. 3rd.",

I have a 25 yr. old son, who has been alot of trouble for me in the years, one thing he won't keep a job. Well, wouldn't you know he ended up getting a girl pregnant and the beautiful baby girl was born April 15th, 2008. I was there for the delivery and her and I fell in love the minute we saw each other. I had her alot when she was a newborn cause the kids just couldn't handle it, I loved every minute but have had alot of health issues along with my 79 yr. old mother, who I love dearly and take care of her( a least I try to do my best). I had the baby on a sunday, a week ago and they called and of couse asked for money, I said no and then, my son and I got to talking and he told me he and his girlfriend were breaking up. the mom(if that's what you can call her, god forgive me) and the baby and her crack-head mother were moving to the next state. Well anyway my son and I got into a fight on the phone and he told me what a sh-tty person I was and hung up on me. Alittle later he called back and my 15 yr. old daughter answered cause I was crying, my son told her that he wanted the baby back right now(which they had originally said I could keep her later so my DH could see her when he got off the road) she said being mad at her brother, not now, he then continued to say they were going to call the police on me. I just thought he was angry, so I started getting the baby ready to go but wasn't in a hurry doing it, when guess what, someone knocked on the door and they did call the cops on me and told them I wouldn't bring the baby home and I was kidnapping her, I couldn't believe it, the policeman seen that I was getting the baby ready to go  but he had to ask me are you taking her home and I said yes, he then went on to tell me that if I wasn't he'd have to arrest me and charge me with kidnapping, I've never been in trouble with the law before in my life, I was so hurt and embarrased. Last week and this week I was suppose to have the baby alot, to spend extra time with her before my surgery (Feb.3), but they haven't got ahold of me and I just found out that the mom, the baby's mom and the baby moved last tues. the 20th and didn't let me know cause they don't want us to know where they are at. I'm so heartbroken, I don't even want to think about my surgery, little lone go through it. I can't seem to function right now and it's only 5 days till my surgery. I cry and I cry did I mention that I'm scared to death over my surgery, with everything on my shoulders I just don't know if I can handle all this. Please pray for my little grandaughter, the people she will be with are not good people, I'm just so scared, I hardly want to go on. Sorry for all of this, I guess that I just needed to get this off my chest, my mom is still sick, so I have to act like everything is ok. ONce again I'm sorry for going on and on. God Bless you All, Bee",

Just hope everybody gets on enough to keep in touch, so we know that all is going good for them.  I will call the PS Monday and see whats going on. My DH thinks that it might be the insurance holding things up. The breast that flipped is the one they already said was for cosmetic purposes and they might not pay for (35,000+), we are still fighting that, so DH says it might just be because it's the left one instead of the right. I don't know, just wish things would ever go the easy route for me..lol. After all these years, you'd think I'd be use to it...lol caligrlof68...Sorry about the fluid build up, I have some too but it seems to be getting less and less, my PS doesn't seem to be worried about it, so I guess mine is ok.

I've gone to Turkey Run State Park all my life, I just love it there, that's park county and we live in vermillion county, so we are only about 25 to 30 miles north west of it. You talked about the covered bridges, have you ever been to the covered bridge festival, that is in Oct. every year. Don't know if you like flea markets, but this festival is big and in several different locations, there is no way to do it all in one day, probably not even two days, it runs for tens days. We enjoy going to it every year. I sometimes don't buy alot, but I love to look around, lots of arts and crafts, antiques, some new things and lots of food..lol They have alittle bit of everything there. When going to see covered bridges, you probably went to a small town called Bridgeton, they have a bridge there, that little town hosts one of the locations that has a festival during Covered Bridge Festival days. As far as Indy goes, I've been there alots but even more now days, my BS and my PS are both there, so we drive 1&1/2, to 2 hours to get there, just about every 2 weeks. I don't mind cause we always go out to eat when we are there and they have many more places to eat, than Terre Haute does....lol Love to go out to eat!!! Well, I've gone on and on long enough, your probably thinking ask this women a simple question and get a book....lol Take care, Bee",

My PS office called today and they moved my surgery from 2 in the afternoon to 8 in the morning, which makes us have to leave by 5 in the morning, it's a 2 hour drive there, so i won't get any sleep Monday night lol. I was so glad they moved it up because i don't like to go without my food, that's how i keep my girlish figure lol, and going from midnight the night before till the afternoon the next day is just too much for this old lady to endure....lol  I'm excited but alittle scared too (really alot scared), i'm so afraid of what they will look like, just have to keep telling myself to trust my PS, she has done wonderful so far. No, Dani, I hate to admit it but i don't know what implants she ordered but i think i will call in the morning and ask, will let you know. If you know anything that would be wrong with the ones she ordered i really appreciate the heads up. I kinda just go with the flow and don't research things, i think i do that because when i tried to research my BC i just got confussed, guess i'm just not as smart as i should be...lol not knowing things does make me wonder if i have or i am doing the right things when it comes to all this. I just have to have faith that i have the right doctors that know what they are doing. Well i will stop rambling now...lol so sorry your having to make a hard decision again, hope you can come to one that makes you happy & that you look perfect but i think you'd look perfect anyway you go. Big hugs to you, Bee",

I love them, I'm so much more comfortable. I also agree with you about the doctors, i wish they would all get on the same page on BC issues, all of them do things different and us women talk, everyone is being treated different, it makes you wonder if your doctor is doing it right or wrong...lol Take care, Bee Terri...Good News on the mx results....Big hug to you, Bee dani...Hope your feeling better, tell DH to lighten up on those bear hugs, but not to stop giving them, they're very important!   lol   Take care, Bee Jennifer....Have you found anything out about a date yet?

I'm just following my PS orders, i just pray she's doing the right thing for me.

I suppose that will happen in time. I guess i have to wait to fluff..lol, it's just been 2 weeks today since exchange, I always get in a hurry with everything, I want what I want NOW!!!

My foobs have not completely dropped and fluffed yet, still waiting on that..lol I don't like them very well, there too high & i don't like the shape but at least the foobs don't have cancer in them like the real one did. Mine also feel like they get under my arm sometimes, that gets uncomfotable, makes me sore under the arms, they are still too high to suit me and smaller than i expected, just listen to me gripe...lol..sorry I just don't feel very happy with them. I thought i'd let you know my new ( well not really new) thing going on with me. I don't know if you remember that i had thyroid cancer before the breast cancer, i had a check up on it right before my masectomy, some tests done and they found some enlarged nodules but decided to get me through the breast cancer surgery before we do anymore about that, so my doc. didn't forget, 1st appt. with her after mx she sent me for a ct of my neck, this time they could tell that it was thyroid tissue that they didn't get when they took my thyroid out, so off to my cancer doc., he sends me for a body scan to make sure the thyroid cancer hadn't gone anywhere else, thank god it hadn't but still the problem with the tissue they found. Anyway, i had to go off my thyroid meds. so i would get real tired ( which i tried to tell them that i already was real tired...lol), for i don't remember how many weeks they kept me off them but the last three weeks i had to be on a low iodine diet then i went to the hospital for another ablasion, which is a radioactive iodine pill, had to stay away from everyone for about 7 days, which in our small house is hard to do...lol But hopefully it killed all the tissue because with it there , there was a greater chance of the cancer coming back, Whoo, i'm worn out after this big book i just wrote, but it's not over yet,,,lol. I go to my primary doc.she sends me for a chest x-ray, because i have a spot on my lung that they found, in 2007, that sent me for a pet scan, that said the spot was just scare tissue but that's when they found the thyroid cancer, so checking out the scare tissue on the lung they by accident found the thyroid cancer, sorry this is so long, i guess i just need to type this all out to feel better, my self perscribed therapy..lol well my doc. sent me for an x-ray on my lungs to check on the spot & the next day the dreaded phone call, we've scheduled you for a ct scan on your lung, cause i don't know exactly why because the nurse just danced around the question, so once again sorry for the book but i just wanted to tell you what's going on with me, for the last 21/2 years it's just been one thing after another! I know alot of you beautiful ladies have had it alot worse than i have, and i'm not trying to take anything away from that but i guess i'm just frustrated, 21/2 years, hysterectomy, thyroidectomy,masectomy and now what a lungectomy.lol, I just keep thinking the other shoe might have fell! So, i go tomorrow for a ct scan & a mri, which was already scheduled on my hip, pitaful aren't i ????? I know i'm being over dramatic but as you all know when you've been through several scarey things, it sometimes is really hard to not think the worst!!!! Well enough of my ranting, I hope that all of you are doing ok, even though i'm not on here much, i think of you all often & your always in my prayers. BIG,BIG HUGS to all......Bee",

Sue that is sure great news, I also got the all clear too, a big relief.. Thank you lord! Ok, got my first fill today, at time of surgery, she put in 150ccs in each and today 100ccs. It did not hurt at all, so I don't know why she didn't put in more, oh well, just glad to get started. The only thing that I don't like about these little foobies ( and I know it will get fixed in the end), is they feel like they are right under my chin. Told PS today that my chest looks like a body builders..lol One more thing is, I've always had big boobs and in my family all the girls seem to gain weight in their bellies and I am no exception. With the big boobs they always stuck out farther than my belly, so It kinda made my belly not look so big. Now that I am close to being flat chested, my belly looks so much bigger...lol Told DH, I look like a pregnant body builder or wrestler...lol Gotta laugh at myself, that's how I get through everything with laughter, so maybe laughter is the best medicine...lol I don't go back for another fill until the 20th, can't wait, it just gets me that much closer to being done...yeah I hope everyone is doing ok, you are all in my thoughts everyday.

I asked her in her career, how many flipped expanders has she ever had, she said just 2 before me, then I asked her how many of those did she have to take back to surgery to fix it and she said none, I'm her first, always wanted to be first in something but this is not quite what I had in mind...lol She said the other 2 women she was able to flip their's back in her office. I always seem to be the odd ball, do everything the hard way...lol She is gonna fill the new one 50ccs over what the other one is and then add 50ccs to it while i'm out. I'll still only be 400ccs in each, your way ahead of me, I wonder why they all do the fills so different. Who knows. How many ccs are you going to go and what size do you hope to be, I know you've probably said before but memory is not one of my strong suits. I'm still not sure what size I want to end up, I just know that I don't want anything bigger than a C cup, I may just stop at a B cup, just not sure. I do know that I need some foobs sticking out to make my stomach look alittle smaller..lol It's getting late and I still want to get my Easter decorations up, even if I have to stay up all night.

People come from all over the United States, some stay the whole 10 days ( don't know how they can afford to stay that long, I'd spend too much money or else spend what I had the first few days...lol).

I'm not saying that they all do, but several do. Just thought I'd let you know that maybe yesterday was grouchy doctors day or something...lol cause I went to my family doctor (whom I dearly love), and on a scale of 1 thru 10, he wouldn't have gotten but about a 3 from me. I kinda left mad, he didn't seem to take any of my questions seriuosly, he was kinda short with me, which he's never been before. Maybe he's sick of me and all my questions...lol.  I always wonder if the doctors let themselves get too many  patients because they care so much and think they can fix everybody or is it just the money? I would like to think the first answer and probably most do, but there is still that percent that's all about the money and prestige. That's just life, I guess. I'll stop rambling now.

We go to Lafayette, Ind. tomorrow to tour the campus at Purdue college with our daughter, so didn't want to take Maddy there with us, so we let her parents babysit her...lol, wish that was the way it is, then i'd probably live longer! (not as much stress & worry when we have her! My son and his girlfriend don't deserve to have a sweet baby like Maddy!). Sorry, i'm ranting now...lol Terri hope your doing good and the incision didn't get infected. Bill Cosby, how lucky are you? I think he's one of the all time great funny men. hope 4cure... Did you find another doctor? I think of you often, let me know how your doing. Take care everyone & big hugs to all, Bee",

I HATE THE WAIT!!!! other than that i guess no news is good news. Thanks to all for thier support, prayers and just caring, it sure means alot. The chairmen for our relay for life got ahold of me, to see if i would go to the survivors dinner they have in the spring sometime and then if i would go when the relay for life is run, she wanta me to walk the first lap with the survivors but i'm not sure that i feel like a survivor, i feel that the ladies that had invasivie Breast Cancer and made it are the true suvivors I better get off of here for now, take care my friends, Bee",

Got the call yesterday about the pet scan and it's OK, i'm so excited, i really thought my luck had run out,(that's what i get for thinking...lol)! Thank you all for your prayers & thoughts! It means alot to me to know that i'm in your thoughts & prayers, you are all in mine & always will be. They are going to have me have another CT scan in 3 months, just to keep an eye on things. dani...just wondering if you've had you implants re-done yet or when you are having them done. Please let me know how your doing & if things get better(you like them better). I don't go back to the PS till January, i'm hoping she thinks mine need to be re-done cause i still don't like them! They are still not right & very uncomfortable. Hope everything goes just the way you want it and you will be very happy with the results. Terri...Good luck on the 17th, your gonna feel so much better once those old expanders are out, my foobs bother me but not like the expanders did. Let us know how everything goes, my thoughts and prayers will be with you everyday but specially on the 17th. Once again thank you all for your encouraging words, you are all so special to me! Take care all & post once in awhile to let everyone know how your doing, i'm gonna try to do this more often myself, it makes me feel so much better knowing that you all are there. Big Hugs to all Bee",
