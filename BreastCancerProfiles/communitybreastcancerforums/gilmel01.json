I actually did have the lung nodule removed without even a biopsy and the doctor is 100% certain it is cancer but not sure lung or breast cancer (90% certain breast) but the pathology of it may not be triple negative. So yes I am oligometastatic if it turns out to be breast. I am thinking next step aggressive chemo",
