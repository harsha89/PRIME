I will find out in the next few days whether I will need radiation so I'll make my decision then. Falconer, I am a high school teacher, a job I love but that I put all of my energy into, which you will relate to. We are on a semestered system, so it makes good sense for me to start back at the beginning of the new semester in early February. I'm leaning that way at the moment. Another friend who has gone through it said she was completely wiped out by her radiation and couldn't have worked. I can see it's all very individual. Thanks again to all!",

My surgery was 6 weeks ago and I feel well. I have my first consultation with the RO today and I am assuming I will need radiation therapy. I'm just looking for advice here. If you had the option of not working during rads, would you take it? Or is it fairly doable to work during the weeks you are receiving treatment? Any input would be appreciated.
