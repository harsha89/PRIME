Maybe with your \"messy\" breasts an MRI would be helpful. And please have your biopsies done by the most experienced doc you can find--I had a whole round (SEVEN) done which missed their marks.

I feel like I should learn about all possible tx to add to my arsenal. itfinallyhit..., you are doing an amazing job--and it is a job, isn't it? Re: cost of custom sleeves/trying off the shelf, etc. My experience so far makes me think there's a lot of trial and error in the fitting of these. I got a (really cool) lymphediva sleeve and gauntlet but PT thinks more compression is needed, however, I could wear the lymphediva one when not swollen so much. I just received a custom sleeve and glove and PT hasn't checked them yet, but the glove is not OK. 30 minutes in and thumb and index finger were numb so off it came. It gets sent back to be tweaked I think (hence the hefty price). Since glove is too tight, I'll wrap my hand when I wear sleeve. There's a lot of jiggling the handle is the bottom line. AND the insert w/these items said they need to be replaced in FOUR months. Wow. I am lucky, as I switched insurance during open enrollment at work, so I have coverage for these at 80% (after deductible). Do you have access to different insurance? Or do you have medicare? I've read (on BCO) some people have fought and gotten coverage from medicare. We need to get congress to pass the bill to get these covered! My supplier (SunMed) does have different (lower) prices for private pay. Custom sleeve: $265.22/156.01, Custom glove: $405.22/238.37, Custom Night Vest: $1834.15/1078.98. Compression bra (Not custom): $446.25/262.50. Quite a challenge for a \"side effect\" of cancer treatment. Still a lot of money, which most of us do not have. A Go Fund Me page might be a good idea. Best to you!",

The docs and techs were extremely professional and also kind. Surgery was at BWH, and was meant to be outpatient but they kept me (maybe in recovery?) overnight. I don't remember much about it but it seemed to be a giant ward with beds separated by curtains. My 83 yo mom was waiting during my surgery and recovery and my surgeon got worried about her (she's 83 and must have been very tired as we had a delay). They called a taxi for her and the nurse called the hotel afterwards to make sure she got home OK. Above and beyond. I've had many appointments and have always been very pleased with my care.

You must hydrate like crazy, and use the antinausea drugs on a schedule, not wait for symptoms to begin. If you have a safe choice, postpone until after your wedding. You'll want to be focused on taking care of yourself during chemo. Wish you the best of luck!",

I started using a sleeve for lymphedema prevention and to move the lymph out of my swollen arm. Maybe it's helping! Meg, how is your Dana Farber experience? I love my surgeon (Dr. Carter) but think I will stick with my local MO. The drive in is 2+ hours which isn't too bad, unless my appts are at 7:30am or at commuting hours! I stayed 2 nights at a nearby hotel for my surgery. I was very surprised to be offered lumpectomy by Dr. Carter when I met her for 2nd opinion. It was very detailed: they inserted two radioactive seeds to mark cancers, and two wire localizations to mark ADH. I think it's unusual to get lumpectomy with multifocal, multicentric disease and I am grateful. Having really large breasts helped I guess! Xyzeng, that's great that you can get Ibrance--it's not approved for early stage here (yet) , only stage 4. The trials are our chance to get it. Good luck! Mom, thanks for the encouragement about rads. My MO wanted me to start anastrozole before surgery even, but my BS disagreed. It is interesting how many different opinions there are. I have an appointment to sign up for PALLAS in a week or two. Onward. ",

Of course it wasn't that easy, and I had to request an MRI myself after researching dense breasts...and oooops, 2 cancers...Multiple attempted biopsies --aka my breast is a pincushion???--failed before I switched to a better hospital. Repeat all biopsies. From 12/15 mammo to 2/2 dx. Hell. Women with dense breasts need those MRIs. And we all need to go to the best hospital/cancer center available. I traveled an hour instead of 20 minutes just for my DEXA because I don't trust my local for anything now. Sorry for the rant. I need to chill now so I can get to sleep. :)",

Or, they do a sentinel node biopsy, put dye into the tumor (or previous location of it, I suppose), follow the dye and remove the first 1-3 nodes. These can be sent to pathology right away, and if it's necessary they can remove more. Anyway, that's my layperson's understanding.

I could have gone to work following the core biopsy, but was on vacation already. The only restriction was no lifting. Best of luck!",

Are you at a really good hospital or breast center? See what the biopsy results are. Then if you are not comfortable, get a second opinion at a top cancer hospital. I had multiple mammograms, ultrasounds, an MRI and multiple biopsies (I had 5 or 6 clips , many misses). That hospital wasn't so good. It took 6-7 weeks to actually get a diagnosis, Hopefully you won't have to wait that long! I guess I'm trying to say that sometimes the process is bumpy, with unclear test results. Your biopsy results should set things to rest, then you can start treatment if you do have cancer. I am really sorry you have had so much trouble already. I'm hoping you'll get a b9 result. In the meantime, waiting is hard. Try to do something nice for yourself. We are here.",

My community hospital failed to diagnose my breast cancer or to refer me to a larger breast center despite findings on mammos and many risk factors. I was dx at Stage III.

You will get results tomorrow? Please let us know how it goes. I have no definitive results, lots of \"highly suspicious\" spots( several in my R, one in my L), so the next thing is a \"focused\" ultrasound where they \"hope\" to do a biopsy or two or three. I guess there is some chance they won't be able to locate them? If they can't do the biopsies, I don't know what's next. (Excisional biopsies on both breasts?) If they can, I wait (again) for those results. Even if everything is b9, I do not want to go through this again, so I'll have some serious conversations about my risks and options.",

So, results of the ultrasound guided biopsy yesterday afternoon: B9! Then a call from the radiologist this morning: maybe they missed the spot (They did multiple biopsies in 3 different locations. Ouch.Pin cushion or what?) and they are asking the breast center in Springfield (MA) to have a look. Radiologist said he would like to do an MRI guided biopsy next. Since 12/18/15 I have had multiple mammograms, ultrasound, stereotactic biopsy, MRI, and ultrasound guided biopsy. I am getting tired of the waiting and no clear answers. So why not do an excisional biopsy? He said they might miss the spot if they do that too. But...there are clips in there! (maybe the clips are in the wrong place?) GAAK. I like the providers, I think they are being very careful. They are very kind and forthcoming when I ask for info. I am glad someone else will be looking at my radiology though. I should hear by Tues 2/2 from the second opinion doc/s. Until then, I wait again. Is it going to be 2 months before I have a definitive answer? Anyone else have multiple tests and a long wait?",

Since Dec. 18 I've had mammograms (microcalcs), an ultrasound, stereotactic biopsy (ADH), and an MRI. The MRI was last Friday and I picked up results today and they don't look encouraging. In addition to the spiculated mass (\"highly suspicious\") in my right breast, which we knew about from the other tests, there are additional areas (3) which are \"suspicious\", and lots of reference to \"rapidly enhancing\" which is also not good. I know that MRIs are likely to light up benign areas, but WTH. BIRADS 4, with no a,b,c. The plan, prior to the MRI, was for an excisional biopsy of the mass in my right breast. Not sure what the plan will be now. Biopsy the other areas too? The MRI report recommends focused ultrasound with possible biopsy, but I think we already know a biopsy is needed. If I'm going to have surgery on both breast, is it reasonable to ask for lots of tissue to be removed (evenly)? Ironically, I was looking into breast reduction prior to all this. Does anyone else have similar MRI experience? (BTW I actually fell asleep during the MRI, after a bit of initial trouble breathing b/c I was congested. I recommend an antihistamine!) Also, I'm not sure how best to participate on these boards. I read other posts and comment if I have something helpful to share, but not sure if/when I should start a new thread.

I had u/s next which showed nothing. Then MRI (I have dense breasts, I think MRI is helpful for that) lit up lots including the calcs they had seen previously. MRI is notorious for lighting up lots, including many B9 spots, so remember that! It's awkward but not at all painful. Today I had an ultrasound again...they used the MRI findings to locate the areas of concern, and did multiple biopsies of 3 areas. It took a really long time. (over 2 hours). The radiology techs and the doc were great. The doc (when I asked) said he'd be surprised if the one spot weren't cancer, but not sure about the others. So I will hear more on Thursday or Friday and then will make appt. with either the surgeon or MO (who I haven't found yet) One day at a time. Affinity? Thinking of you. Simple? Did you meet with the surgeon today?",
