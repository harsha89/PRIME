So far Ive been very disappointed in the experience with the doctors I've delt with....I should mention I'm in Canada so it seems that the process might be a bit different then the US.  Anyways, Im now finally booked for a biopsy but no one seems to be able to tell me what to expect.  Today I called and they told me that I should be able to go back to work right after but from what Ive read on here that doesn't seem to be the case for everyone.  Am I just being silly taking the day off?  Also should I be driving if I'm going to be frozen? Im an absolute wreck over this.   Thank you so much for your help! Log in to post a reply",

The heads up about the loud noise is especially helpful...I don't deal well with unexpected loud sounds:)  I don't think I'll be having a mamogram after...haven't had one yet but I'm 28 and they mentioned I was too young for that.  I will bring the sports bra though.  Hopefully it will be over and done with soon so I can stop thinking about it. So far it's been a very long process, but Im sure it's nothing and I'm just worrying for nothing.",
