    "Content": "travelingmom wrote: Hi everyone, I posted on here a little while ago about a lactating adenoma that never went away: it's been 9 months and it's still there. Recently within the last two months my armpit has been swollen and tender. i thought I might have another lump but they couldn't find it on the ultrasound last week but they did redo the last one of which they said previously was a lactating adenoma. They said they would come back with results the next day and now it's been a week and nothing. Anyway I did find another lump while at home and it's deeper in the tissue. Ita about the size of a pea. I also notice when I put on my bra that the swelling is so much under my left armpit that it juts into it. All morning I've had an aching and sharp pains that radiate around the left side of my breast to my armpit. It's been like this for 2 months and since its new pain I'm pretty concerned. It almost feels like a pulled muscle. It even hurts all the way up to my neck sometimes. This is only on my left side and has never affected both. Only the side with the mass. Should I call the doctor and see if they can get me in again and retry finding this new lump? They couldn't find it last week.i was so frustrated. It's definitely there. I'm thinking it may relate to the swelling in my armpit. They haven't even done a proper mammogram yet. Should I push for one ? I feel like the doctor isn't taking my concerns seriously. Did any of you have pain and swelling near your armpit before the lumps appeared ? Log in to post a reply",
