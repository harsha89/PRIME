I know it all may seem a little bizarre and/or questionable but may be interesting for you to hear (esp.

Oops I have to go know so will finish later.  Quick question: how to add to my signature stuff?",

I also developed a \"seroma\" lymph fluid buildup in the site of the lumpectomy tumor excision which has been such a bummer.  I finally went to my BS and he drained it with a huge needle and took out what looked like 1/4 cup of reddish yellow (sorry to be gross).  But it has filled up again. Apparently it's part of natural healing process and gets reabsorbed by the body eventually but can take up to a month.  In the meantime, I am really sad to have this bruised, lumpy, sore, partially-numb breast be the state in which it passes its final days before getting removed in BMX on May 16th.  I had wanted to have a chance to say goodbye in a different state.  However, despite the seroma, I am trying to honor my breasts as best I can in these last days, before bidding them a fond farewell.  Someone told me that we will always have the \"echo\" of our breasts with us, so we never really completely lose them.  That was comforting to me.  And I really hope I can keep the nipples/areola -- as long as they are clear of cancer and if they can keep a healthy blood supply (they have to be detached and moved).  It's a big risk but I am willing to deal with it. ",

I've asked my husband to try to take some \"tasteful, artistic\" pictures this weekend of me (he sweetly and gamely agree which is big of him since he is usually terrible at taking regular photos of me) to be able to remember my old girls in their original state, although my lumpectomy side is still rather beaten up looking, and in my current fanciest bras (my new foobs will be much smaller).  Has anyone else done this?",

However, on Monday (5 weeks post-BMX), he confirmed that it was necrosis (skin dead but it was not infected) and so he actually had to remove it (cut it off with scissors -- couldn't feel a thing, didn't look) and he put a bandage back on over the whole NAC.  Bummer, now I'll not have a right nipple until sometime in the fall, when he will have to take skin from somewhere on me (ugh, ouch!) to try to build/attach a new one.  But it will just be local anesthetics in his office I think. And then they will put a tatoo color on the NAC to try to match my left real one.  Does anyone have any comments/opinions about where to get the skin for a new nipple?",

I just had corrections to my May 2012 BMX, nipple sparing on one side, with immediate silicon gel implants.  I went from a 34DD pre surgery to a 34B-C, so the technique used was incisions of the style: anchor and keyhole cuts (moved left nipple areola complex (NAC) up higher on left breast).  My left NAC survived and my right NAC was reconstructed from excess breast skin.  (Note my right NAC's vascularization had been comprised due to incisions during lumpectomy so PS thought not worth trying to save -- I wonder now!)  The areola took but the nipple necrosized within the first month and healed over flat.  The implants were generally fine but I had excess loose skin along the underside inframammary folds of both breasts and the positioning of each implant -- especially the right one -- was a little high causing a kind of fold on the upper pole, and both were closer to the sides or armpits. So this week, 7 months post BMX, I had these revisions done under general anesthesia in a 2 hour long operation by my perfectionistic and humorous PS.  He told me that during the operation he stitched and restitched the positioning twice, because it wasn't exactly right.  He said the op staff just sighed with his persnicketiness but he was proud of what he had accomplished. My doctor would not let anyone go home until the drains are out, so I had to spend 3 days, 2 nights.  I felt fine the whole time.  It was nothing like the BMX.  No pre-op calming drugs before the general anesthesia (I didn't want any I was calm), only paracetomal and antiinflammatory pills afterwards.  Lots of water and tea.  The clinic is like a luxury hotel disguised as a hospital, so I shouldn't complain, but I just wanted to get HOME! But still, the question is.... will my nipple take?  He just used a graft of my excess breast skin to make the nipple.  I had queried him about nipple implants and alloderm etc, but he would listen to none of it.  He had considered adding injections of hyaluronic acid (a naturally occuring substance in our bodies used in fillers for cosmetic purposes I guess kind of like botox), but decided to wait because that could be done on future office visits if needed. He checked my breasts by pulling off the industrial hospital tape that is acting like an Egyptian mummy-like bra.  I looked down and thought the breasts looked really big and different!  I don't want bigger boobs!  He promised me he hadn't switched the 270cc implants for bigger ones and said they would calm down in due time.  He said they were closer now and so I would show some cleavage (which I didn't before).  I just have to be realistic about the high risk that the nipple will not survive, but I will try to send healing messages throughout my body (I don't necessarily believe that will do anything, but it can't hurt).  If the new nipple doesn't survive, I think I will just go for tatoos and a stick-on kind.  I am just not interested in doing anything more plastic surgeryish.   He retaped me back up and said to come back to his office Tuesday with my sports bra and velcro band which I will have to wear again for 6 weeks -- ugh! I will ask about the nipple cones and other protective devices, which he never used on me before.",

(after the BMX the lab showed the left side was completely clear but with ILC it often returns on the other side, so I am still glad I did it for prophylatic reasons). I am going to ask my onco doc about what has happened to my tumors.  Where are they now, saved or destroyed, and if saved how stored?  Do I still own them or have I ceded my rights with whatever I signed at the hospital and once they are out of my body?  I was vaguely aware of these issues but at the time, didn't focus on it.  However, I just read for my book club \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\" by Rebecca Skloot which brought to the forefront the question of informed consent, cell line ownership, etc., but more for me, the issue is if I were to have recurrence in the future it would be good to have the genomic info about the first tumors, I would think.",
