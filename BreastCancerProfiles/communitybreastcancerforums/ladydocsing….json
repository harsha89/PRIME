And, i didn't have drains this time... i was THRILLED!  i do waken at night when i roll onto my side, but just because of a sense of pressure on the pectoralis muscle, not pain.  I am 4 weeks post exchange tomorrow.  I still have that spasm feeling or maybe muscle fasciculation with things like yawning, but much improved.  i was wondering if the location of the port for the instillation of saline makes a difference in part of the discomfort.  my muscles (pecs) were so sensitive just over the port area... i had the Mentor TE's that had the port on top that the PS had to localize with the magnet to fill.  Also with the fills - Ugh!  I had 120cc at operation and on day 8 post op he put in 150cc's ... that about killed me... put my out of commission for doing any Christmas shopping that whole weekend.  PS said that he wanted to fill me fast to put pressure on that Alloderm so the skin would incorporate it better.  Whatever.  I was finished with fills 5 weeks post op (he did 360cc total... i was a B pre-op and aiming for essentially the same size).  With each fill i was very uncomfortable...took ibuprofen and percocet. i also took neurontin (gabapentin) to try to decrease the sensitivity all around the edges... to sort of numb that hard edge.  it worked some but not 100%... it may have worked better had i used a higher dose (i am a hospice physician and do pain management), but i knew that i would want time to wean the med down because i was fairly certain i wasn't going to need it after the exchange. The point is, despite the discomfort, it is SOOOOOooo much better after the exchange is done.  Good luck to you.  There is an end to all of this.",

Given the option of surveillance and or tamox, i would still have chosen BPM... it was right for me.  I personally saw no need for me to see a counsellor though. I am happy with my result so far.",

I can't quite do what i used to...my PS has restricted me \"for life\" with the implants in...no moving furniture, heavy lifting, body building (yah right, LOL), so i've become a lightweight there...i do aerobics and core ball minus any workout using my pecs.  I do wake up at night with turning when i lay on my side, but tons better than with the TE's in. I am a little larger than i was pre-BPM, it doesn't bounce and no-one has a clue that I'm cold! Hehehe... I digress, but I'm glad i did what i did.  My insurance paid... my surgeons were in network, so after i met my deductible (met that with my ACL rupture and reconstruction there last fall), i had no out of pocket expense.  Of  course this year i am paying my deductible for the exchange.",
