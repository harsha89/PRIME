She is scared sick bc doctors can not get infection under control. What the heck! Like me, she is 7 days out from 2nd chemo. I told her I would come on here and ask for the expertise from all of u! I swear you know more than doctors! Please share any info with me at alll!!!! Dx 7/2/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
