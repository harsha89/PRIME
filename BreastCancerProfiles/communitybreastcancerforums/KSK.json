If it is, I guess I\u2019ll have to live with it but it\u2019s a large hard lump (as always was) so quite uncomfortable in my small breasts... Any cyst advice hugely appreciated! Thanks.

I\u2019m also only 33 with 2 beautiful young children & have recently had a \u2018scare\u2019 - in fact still scared! I found a small lump 6 months ago which has grown into a large mass. When I finally found the courage to go to my Dr her demeanour also changed - dramatically. I\u2019ve seen a Consultant now whom also can\u2019t tell me what it is from just palpating so I am waiting on an Ultrasound & Biopsy. I pray yours is benign as I do mine. Keep us posted. You are not alone. X",

      "Content": "Nov 25, 2017 12:48PM - edited Nov 25, 2017 01:14PM by KSK Hi Monkeymomma  My lump is moveable but I can't define its edges & it's in the upper outter quadrant of my breast. It's texture isn't smooth, more rippled & firm. It feels (& is) attached to the back of my areola. It's approx 5cm so I'm told. I also have nipple / areola changes.  If working on the 2 second rule (my instinct) before my logical brain kicks in, I think it's not good news. However, logically & researching it could be a Fibroadenoma.  If you're in tune with your body, you could well be right but I do think it's natural for us to assume the worst due to self preservation. Please do keep us posted! I'm still waiting on an urgent ultrasound date",
