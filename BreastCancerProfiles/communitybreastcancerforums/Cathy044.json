I had the doctor point out the calcifications on the screen for me to see. It's a tight circle of microcalfiations. Any clue from that as to the chances of it being benign or not? They also only had to go in once to get samples which does concern me a little since I'm assuming with benign material they would go in a few times to make sure? Any opinions on that? Now I need to wait 3 business days on results - probably Monday they said Log in to post a reply",
