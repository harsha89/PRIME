    "Content": "terv wrote: Hello, Recently I had a lumpectomy on the right breast and the pathology reported that it was Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  The sentinel node was negative. The MRI with contrast that I had done 3 days before the lumpectomy revealed a clumped non masslike enhacement in one area of teh left breast and a linear non masslike enhacement in another area of the left breast. How do you treat this?  Can you remove it surgically?  The MRI reports suggested a MRI gueded biopsy, but since the right breast revealed cancer I am tempted to bypass this. Log in to post a reply",
