But for you to write, \"I think permanent hair loss is pretty uncommon - I wouldn't worry too much about it\" is offensive and demeaning to those of us who are posting here and telling you that we have suffered permanent hair loss.It's not a possibility for us - it is our reality and that is what we are talking about. I'm happy for you that you got your hair back but I didn't and neither did many of women posting here. It is not trivial and it is not insignificant -- it is life altering and contributes to a lower QOL.",

And then, if it is malignant -- DO NOT DELAY treatrment for even 1 minute as it can make a difference between life and death. Even a tiny cancer can be very aggressive. Cancer doesn't leisurely move from stage 1 to stage 2 to stage 3 etc..... it tends to jump from early stage to stage 4 .....you are talking about your life and it seems you are making assumptions about how cancer works. Cancer does not follow any rules and it changes in a heartbeat. Also the information you have about the size is preliminary and just a best guess. Often the size is very different once it's removed and measured - can be much bigger or can be smaller. In my experience, it was always much bigger.  Still hoping for B9 results ",

What did the mammogram show? Did she have ultrasound and mri? Frequently ultrasound &/or mri can bring some clarity to the situation but the biopsy is the deciding factor. Best wishes and hoping for B9 results.",

I took my hat off and he said my hair looked strange (which it does -- very thin and it doesn't do anything) - he said I should put the hat back on so no one would laugh at me.

I'm sure something good will turn up for you. Judy, how are you? Lena, thanks for the (((hugs))) - felt good. I had a similar relationship with a man for several years. Difference is, even though he promised to stick with me, he abandoned me. Betsy & Titan .... glad that things are progressing positively Wedding is in 2 weeks. I'm going to try a different hairdresser this weekend to see what he can do. This is the guy who is going to do the bride's hair - might as well try - nothing to lose. It would be great if he could some extensions for me. Keep your fingers crossed. I'm going topless because I just didn't want to wear a hat in the heat and I have too much hair for the wig. I'm still using the minoxidil two times a day. I think it helped a little. But my hair is still very thin and very fine. I used to have the thickest hair ... very, very curly....but with thick hair, I could do a lot with my hair. Now I have \"old man\" hair ..... really ugly. I'm still carrying 50 - 60 pounds too much. I've put on about 40 since the bc dx ... chemo, etc. and then the Arimidex makes it impossible to lose. I have a dress. It's nice. Too bad I look crappy in it. But I am excited for the kids and want them to have a special day. My biggest worry is this stupid G20 that's happening. Bad enough our government is spending 2 billion on security and various things - a waste of money. But the security zone starts 20 steps away from our wedding venue. There's lots of protesters in town so I'm worried that they might be rabble rousing in front of the hotel. My son works in the middle of the financial district, which is in the security zone...fortunately, he's going on his honeymoon but the bank is moving people out for the week because of the potential danger. I bet none of you had to worry about the G20 disrupting your child's wedding .... wish us luck.",

It's most unusual but we still have more than an official month of winter to go and sometimes the worst storms can be in March. The good news at that time is that it melts quickly. While I would love to meet all of you, I don't think I'll be able to come to this year's get together even though you mention some great locations.

I know I'm doing the right thing but I feel badly because there is so much about this job that I will miss. There will be some thing I won't miss. So far my \"give a donation instead of a gift\" has raised $490 towards the new Breast Cancer Centre they are building. I'm hoping the donations will get to $3,000. It's only a drop in the bucket but every drop helps. It will be a rapid dx so a woman can find out everything in 1 day and then start treatment faster. Hope the weather is good where you are.

I agree that it is a walk in the park compared to chemo but still not a party. The first time I did have some burning but not terrible. Second time, no burning, but I did find the surgical site where the lymph nodes were removed tightened up again and it took a while to go back to where it had been. New research is saying that rads gives a huge benefit in preventing recurrence. How many is she suggesting? And happy birthday to everyone",

Then from that group of cousins, many of their daughters were dx with bc and there were also some deaths. So, because there was so much bc in our family, and then my own first cousin was dx with bc ... she did the BRCA test which came back positive and then her daughter also had a BRCA test which was positive. ....the docs were sure that I would also be BRCA2+ which I was. This also puts us a greater risk for ovarian, melanoma, and pancreatic. So despite getting ovaries removed, the odds for the long term are not good for those of us who are BRCA2+    The BRCA1 is slightly different. And then there is a strong belief that there is probably a BRCA3 or BRCA4 that have not yet been identified but are probably there. It's not just breast cancer. The men in the family have been affected by other cancers - all related to BRCA2 On another note, my youngest son got engaged this weekend. No wedding details yet. My future DIL is a lovely girl and they are very happy together. ",

I don't know if it will work but I was thinking I'd like to be a coach/navigator for parents who are struggling with the school system so they can help their kids. Teach them what they need to know so they can better advocate for their kids. I still have many days when I feel lousy about myself - it is such a struggle as I have never come to terms with all the se's and the impact that BC has had on my life. I got my BRCA2+ dx after I had my first BC dx which was TN. Doctors were not surprised and had warned me that it was a strong probability because of my family history. So after lumpectomy, chemo, rads, I had my ovaries and tubes out. Docs were pressuring me to do bmx but I didn't want to do it and opted for surveillance which included MRI. Also started seeing dermatologist at cancer centre to watch for possible melanoma. There is no screening for pancreatic. Then 3 1/2 years later got second BC dx. This one was 100% ES+ and I think 90% PR+ despite having ovaries removed. It had already spread to at least 4 lymph nodes despite surveillance. So had to have bmx along with chemo and rads again. So I do feel like BRCA 2 is a cloud over my head and it's just a matter of time until something else happens. My oldest son has found out that he also carries it so my grandchildren are also at risk.

Yes, it does seem that many of us have issues - either bc or treatment related se's. Or just getting older - which I guess is good news. Glad that this job has worked out well for you and that you are getting satisfaction from what you do. That does make it worthwhile. I think we all have struggled with Lena's passing. She was definitely a unique character and added so much \"colour\" to our discussions. She is irreplaceable. During the Christmas season, I once again plan on doing an act of kindness in her honour. I will probably do the same as last year which was to make an anonymous donation at a small store I deal with for post mastectomy products. There are many women without insurance for whom either a prosthesis, a mastectomy bra, lymphedema sleeves etc..... become a hardship. So I gave the store money and they helped one of their customers who was in financial difficulty. No tax receipt for me. No name. But when I went back a few months later I received a big hug from one of the owners - which was from the woman who received the help...apparently she cried when they told her of the donation. I think that is something Lena would have approved of. Michele, I know you are busy but I do hope you will return soon and stay in touch.  ",

I have a friend who was recently dx with DCIS and her guy is also treating her like an idiot but for some reason instead of just going for another consult she is busy asking everyone else what they would do. I don't understand. I've been spending a lot of time at work and letting it take over my life (like I used to do). In my mind I'm thinking of making this my last year - this is my 41st year of working (a couple of short mat leaves along the way plus bc time off) but it's a long time. I think I need to make time for myself - exercise every day, rest properly, less stress, do nothing, time with grandkids .. .whatever. The Wellbutrin is still helping but the real changes have to come from me. Most of the time I'm doing ok but I still have my moments. Lena, so glad you are enjoying your new home - it sounds like you did the right thing. Judy, sorry you are still feeling up and down but I think the rest of us relate -- your feelings are very normal.

There's a short list of about 6 people who are each anxious to get my job so they will be happy. Now I have to put all my documents together and get them to the pension board.

Paula, sorry your ex couldn't hang in. This BC journey is bumpy at the best of times Lena, keeping my fingers and toes crossed for best results possible. Today I had my Zometa infusion. This was my 4th and the 3rd different nurse. She was very nice. However, when she put the needle in, it hurt a little which I expect and then she put saline in to make sure everything moving. I told her i felt a burning sensation but she said that was just because it was cold. So she put the drug into the solution and starts letting it run. It was very very slos but she said that was because of the small needle. She keeps telling me it was ok but I know it's never this slow. In the meantime the injection site continues burning. After 40 minutes still nothing much happening and I again mention it's hurting so she looks and sees that the needle is not in the vein and the drug solution is going just under my skin and forming bumps. So, she stops the IV, pulls out the needle and has to find another vein and this one works and the while thing goes quickly. But, part of the drug solution has not gone into my veins but just under the skin where it is useless. She says no big deal. The amount of drug is tiny, tiny (costs $667) so if even a small amount doesn't go in, is it effective? I really don't know what to do. She wasn't negligent and she was nice so I don't want to create a problem for her but I'm worried. Should I call Access Zometa and ask them? I don't think anything can be done anyway.",

It's wasn't so long ago that we were in the middle of the chemo phase of our treatment. I even finished my rads yesterday and tonight I anxiously took my first Arimidex pill. Is anyone else starting an A.I.? Today, I took a long walk and felt good even though I wore compression sleeves - a woman who I have never seen before came up to me, looked at my arms and wanted to know what happened to me!!!! In 3 weeks I see PS to talk about DIEP. I find it easier to move forward now that I'm not in that chemo fog. Now I just wish my hair would start to grow again.",

We went to his house because it's easier for the little ones. Ordered in Chinese and I brought the Baskin Robbins ice cream cake - his request -  While I'm sitting across from him during dinner I notice a funny kind of rash on the sides of his foreheard. So I finally said something - he poo pooed it .. told me it was eczema and he had already put cream on it ... I wouldn't let go, he got annoyed. But....he did go to doctor first thing this morning and what he has is an extreme reaction to a drug he's on (for 5 years) and this reaction could potentially be life threatening if left unchecked. ...so the moral....listen to your mother. And son #3 has just received a job offer within his existing company that is a big step up for him .... And son #1 ... is living in a house in an area where there is a lot of development - condos ... and a developer is coming around giving offers that are over market value .... so another possible change. And baby due in 6 weeks. Son #2 is also doing just fine ..",

When I went through this the first time I found myself on a forward path of getting stronger, feeling better, resuming normal activities although in hindsight it took about 2 years. I just don't feel the same this time as I feel that I have lost so much (body parts, relationships, family members), still feeling the effects of the chemo so many months down the line so it's much more difficult for me to get on a forward looking path. I know that there is much to be grateful for and I do try to focus on that but it really is harder the second time and I haven't gotten over the losses and I still worry that my hair won't come back. Thank you so much for your kind message.",

Amy, interesting about the trainer's effect on your DH. I've been going to therapeutic yoga since January and I LOVE it. It is definitely helping. I go only once a week - wish I could do more. I started Metformin 2 years ago - didn't drop any weight with it. I'm also trying to keep sugar out of my diet, the only dairy I'm having is plain Greek yogurt and so far I'm finding the wheat not so hard to eliminate. I don't see the nutrionist again until next Tuesday so I'm not sure what the scale would say but I'm guessing that I'm over the 10 pound mark now. As you know my hair never grew back well after chemo -- and with the Arimidex it has been continuing to thin -- upsets me a lot - anyway yesterday I caved in and started wearing a hairpiece - I guess it helps but I hate the fact that I have to have it. Also tattooed my eyebrows - because they were almost nonexistent after chemo ... will this never end?",

While we knew the end was inevitable, it actually came suddenly. She had still been in active treatment but she developed a bladder infection and she was just too weak to fight it. It spread quickly to her heart. Anyway we've been very upset and it's been a busy week with the funeral and the shiva. The future DIL stepped up and was amazing - don't know what we would have done without her. I have to admit I stopped thinking about my hair and my issues for a few days.

So believe me, it's not you. It's the situation. They won't give me a date. I just have to wait for a phone call which will tell me ... it will be in 5 days ... or something like that. Judy, is there any possibility they could move you up from June? I figure I should just start getting ready as it is a long recovery and I am alone so want to be as self-sufficient as possible. Cool but a sunny day here. I'm off to the theatre to see \"Sister Act\" today.",

This week I will start preparing and freezing meals that work for me. And I'll make sure I have things I need in the house so I won't need much shopping. I'm sure if I need a little, friends will help. My biggest worry is will I be able to get out of bed myself and shower? If I can do that and make it downstairs, I'll be fine. My sister said she would stay with me for a few days to help when I come home. Lesley, any tips on what to take to the hospital?",

Happy Birthday ... like Geri, 50 was 14 years ago for me ... such a long long time ago. Nice to see several of our sisters return. It is coming up to that year 4 for me too. Amy, the hair thing is BIG. Today I had an appointment with the RO for a regular check up (have been alternating b/w MO & RO up till now)......anyway at my hospital they ask you to fill out a survey before you see the doc - like how u feeling? Thinking that no one would look at it, I filled it in honestly as I've been feeling quite down lately. Anyway, one of the nurses who knows me saw the form and came in - started asking me questions and I just cried. RO came in and was concerned so after she checked me over, she called in the MO....she is asking if I want to change from Arimidex to Tamoxifen - said it is only 1% - 2% slightly less effective but the se's might be easier - especially maybe stop the hair loss....couldn't decide what to do so am going back to see her again in a few weeks. Really don't know what to do. Anyone care to offer advice? I wonder if the AI affects my mood too. There are just times that I feel so overwhelmed and feel that no matter what I do, there are just some things that will never get better anyway......I still wish I could go back to who I was before bc. ",

Have to go for blood work as MRI people want more info. Just hoping that I don't have to wait too long for MRI. If there is anything wrong with our Canadian health care (it's excellent but not perfect), it is the wait times for MRI. Doctor has put in urgent request but not life threatening. I need MRI before any treatment can be recommended. If it is a cyst, then I need to see neurosurgeon. It's all much too slow and I'm not sure if I have truly explained to my doctor how bad it is although I tried. I just hate to complain. Thanks for giving me permission to kvetch here.

Judy, glad to hear that each day is better for hubby. The Bazinga is where the guests all dance around you to celebrate that you have married off your last child. They make you wear a crown of leaves in your hair, and someone uses a broom to symbolize that you have swept them out of your house. I only saw it last week for the first time and it seems to be a happy dance......almost like a hora that we do at the start of the party. The parents sit on chairs in the middle of the circle while everyone dances around them. I've been warned. LOL. Anyway, rehearsal and dinner is tomorrow. I'm still trying to get my house ready. Tomorrow, first thing i will buy lots of flowers to put around the place. Today is Mother's Day so having lunch with the entire crew. We are 11 people now when we get together.",

The hospitals are very good about controlling pain so you probably won't feel pain. And they do get you up sitting in a chair within 24 hours. I am happy with how my revision looks and I even have a much improved (almost perfect) range of motion now. I hope PS will remove bandages tomorrow and that she will be happy with how things are healing now. Judy, for the first 2 weeks you are not supposed to raise your arms above shoulder height. So we placed anything I needed at a counter height especially in the kitchen and bathroom. And for 3 months you can't lift anything over 10 pounds. I still have almost a month to go.

Don't know why when 10 weeks ago it was ok. But I can tell you that I have had zero pain. Nothing at all. Didn't even need a Tylenol although they gave me a script for stronger stuff. I have no aftercare to perform. I am bandaged with clear bandages so I can see everything and she did a great job of removing the necrotic tissue, matching up the other side as well, and it doesn't seem that I lost much volume....just a little bit. I go back to see PS next Tuesday so I guess I'll know then how the healing is coming along. That is my only concern....that this heals properly now. I feel fine. But am taking it easy because they did do major cutting and I don't want to disturb anything. No question that DIEP is a difficult surgery but after the first few days, you do feel much better.

I take Wellbutrin and while it doesn't solve problems, I am able to function better and no longer cry all the time. Wellbutrin doesn't have side effects that I can determine and my onc also likes this medication. All the drugs we are on really mess with our emotions.

I'm getting emails now from guests who are concerned about the G20 security but hotel says everything is ok. I pick up my dress on Wednesay. I tried a new hairdresser who rubbed eyeshadow on my scalp to try to cover the bald/thin spots and he did a decent job on the hair I do have.

The heat here is unbearable ... about 36C (100 + F) so best to stay indoors with A/C Work is slow now because the schools are closed and the kids are off for the summer. I still have some meetings - mostly with new principals or principals who are transitioning from one to another - going over their entry plans. I have lots of paperwork to do but can get it done over the summer. I prefer to save my holidays for during the school year. While I appreciate your advice, Lena, I don't think I can do it. My first dx was TN so there was no medication to take and so I just moved on. I'm not sure it's the Arimidex that is making me feel so lousy because I was feeling this way before I started the Arimidex. This time I lost my hair (it has not grown back properly), I lost my breasts, and I lost the man who was in my life. Whether or not I take Arimidex isn't going to bring any of those things back and the bc was 100% ES+  I feel lousy about myself because of my losses and while I might have coped better if the guy had stayed around, the fact that he left (without telling me) because of the illness just made things worse. I know everyone can say \"well he wasn't worth it\" .. and maybe he wasn't but he was the man in my life and to lose him because of SFBC was just the last straw for me. I don't think going off the AI will help. I saw the therapist yesterday -- I spend the time with her crying -- I look like s^^t and feel like it too. Although I am grateful that my kids are happy and doing well. I just never imagined that I'd end up alone and totally unlovable.",

We all do the best we can - maybe the Arimidex is making things worse but maybe not. As I said, it doesn't change the circumstances. I like  your descriptions of love and totally agree. As women, we need and want it all .. .need to feel loved for who we are on the inside and also love to feel loved for our outside qualities too ..... it's hard when any part of it disappears. Many romantic relationships begin with the superficial things that attract us to each other and it's an exciting part of life. Hopefully the relationships develop into deeper more meaningful attractions but it's great to continue to experience the excitement of romance. I spent almost 6 years with this man and the last time I saw him (the night before my surgery) he said there was zero chance that he would bail on me ..... but he did. He was also supportive of me doing the surgery because he said I was choosing life .... so go figure ..... I think it's easier to get over these heartbreaks when  you are younger and always meeting new people. But at this stage and age - half bald, no breasts, fat stomach ..... I don't have the will or the courage to start again. Lena, your pack rat must be a good guy and must love for who you are - both inside and outside. Enjoy your time with him.....and he know how to get the AC going .... very good....extra points for that ... LOL",

I'm also getting ready for the new school year but I don't get summers off - however, workdays are much easier. This week has been intense already. I have 8 new schools to supervise and 3 brand new rookie principals. So I've been spending time in each school getting to know the folks and coaching the principals on their entry plans. It is actually enjoyable because these are great people. But the days are long and we already have parents complaining about things even though the school year hasn't even started.

I work until August 31 but we do 4 day weeks in the summer so every weekend will be a long weekend for me until work stops. I haven't moved out of my office yet so that is the goal for July as well as tying up a few loose ends. Although I didn't want the Retirement Party (I really don't enjoy partying any more - I'm quite anti-social I think -- a result of bc) it turned out to be a lovely event. Not fancy - no hotels or country clubs - but in a school. They decorated with flowers and balloons - no booze though because we can't have booze in a school which was fine with me. They had party sandwiches and cake. Lots of people showed up -- about 120 I think which was amazing. There were speeches (not too many though) saying such nice things about me. My girlfriend told me to enjoy it because it usually only happens at one's funeral and of course you don't hear it then. My kids, their spouses, grandkids were there too. So I have to say that I actually enjoyed it. Hope everyone is having a great long weekend whether you celebrate on July 1 or July 4.",

I found that the week after I was finished skin continued to redden but after a week, improvement was fast. Lucky me, I had two rounds of rads - each dx. First time the RO was the bitch from hell. This time when they tried to send me back to her I refused - said if they wouldn't give me a different doctor then I wouldn't go for treatment. It worked. Now I have a wonderful RO.

What we don't get however (and with all due respect for the democratic process which we all cherish) is what went on in the USA for the past few weeks where it appears to those of us in other countries that your guys had les interest in resolving the debt crisis than they did in trying to make themselves look good. I could be wrong and I don't mean to offend anyone - it's just how it was portrayed. In our government, when the Prime Minister has a majority government, there wil be debate but in the end when the vote is taken the Prime Minister gets his way. Also our Senate is not nearly as powerful as yours and I think they are pretty ineffective. It's a different form of democracy and also has it's problems.

They were claiming that it really helps women following chemo and who are taking hormone treatments. I have to admit I ordered it ($63.50 Cdn). Has anyone else heard of it? Does it work?",

And it also cost $20 for parking. I could have requested that the \"real\" doctor come in but by then I just wanted out of the place. It was a beautiful warm day so my friend and I went for a very long walk. Anyway, not important enough to think about it any more.",

She also said that the fact that my hair continues to thin out is most likely Arimidex and nothing can be done. Temperature here is sweltering as well.

She is from Egypt and runs a local salon which is anything but fancy (an understatement) She is a very sweet woman and has started becoming interested in helping women with hair loss/extensions. She is in the middle of taking her courses. Anyway I needed to see someone who would be kind so I just stopped in and she was so sweet and happy to see me. She said she has very gentle colour which she could use to cover the grey and she suggested a little trim to make things look neater. She also said I should be patient with the minoxidil and that she is sure that before the wedding in June she can help me to make my hair look fuller. You are such a wonderful group of women.

Enjoy your family and I hope exMIL gets better in time to enjoy Christmas. We have had an ice storm here. Many people without power and worries that things will get worse. Trees covered in ice are falling and bringing down power lines. So far I have power, just no cable for the tv. My sister and niece are sleeping over as their house is very cold now. One son also doesn't have power and I told him to come but he said he and his wife are ok for now. I've offered a number of friends and relatives to come .... Not worried about enough beds, just want them to be warm and comfortable. Worst ice storm we have had here that I can ever recall. On the other hand, visually, it's beautiful.",

I'm still taking drugs so it's basically still active treatment in my opinion. I won't wear the survivor t-shirt as it makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to bring extra attention to myself. I didn't do anything heroic, just did what I had to do even though I didn't want to. My mother was dx with a recurrence after almost 3 years and died 2 years after that in 1983. Tamoxifen didn't help her but I don't know if they knew about triple negative back then and of course the BRCA had not been discovered either. She was definitely treated as though she was hormone + My DIL's mother had a recurrence after 81/2 years and died within 2 years after that. It was just 4 years ago. She did take Tamoxifen for 5 years but I know she was not compliant with taking her AI when she switched. She said it gave her headaches. So who knows? I have another friend who is almost 20 years out (5 years on Tamoxifen and 5 years on Femara) and she is doing fine. And considering that I had a 2nd primary 3 1/2 years following the first one, well I'll never feel clear. It's not that I go around worrying all the time, but that 2nd dx did change me. I'm still working on trying to enjoy each day.",

What little bit of hair I have is not healthy - very thin, dry, limp and my scalp shows through all over the top. It's impossible to style my hair as nothing holds. I'm sure almost all of you will be just fine. I wouldn't mind if my hair was very short, if at least it was thick enough to cover my scalp. Best wishes to you all.

After my first chemo, the hair grew back at a quick pace but was not as thick - I had had my ovaries out. This second experience is completely different and it looks like the crown is going to be much much thinner as well. I would just like enough hair to cover my scalp so that I don't have to wear the wig any more. Has anyone put in a weave or extensions just to create more thickness on top? Although I have to admit I hate the thought of doing that. Anyway, I'm 19 weeks PFC so maybe like Linda, by 30 weeks the growth will get better. My eyebrows have not yet filled in either - I just have a little bit. I'm trying to be patient.",

He agreed that almost 5 months is a long time for hair not to grow back but he said that it's not time to give up ... there is still a strong possibility that it will come back.

I'm still incredibly sad about so many losses so I've not been on line for a few days. But, I did see the dermatologist yesterday. She has given me 2 prescriptions. One is for minoxidil for my head. She said it may help fill in the crown of my head where the hair is so thin that my scalp shows through. She also gave me a prescription for a Latisse like product to try to fill in my eyelashes It is not really Latisse but will be mixed by the pharmacists for me and it's much less expensive than Latisse which is not even available in Canada yet. I've had a little bit of growth in the past few weeks but very little and certainly not on the crown. So I'll fill the prescriptions and I'll let  you know what happens. Keep your fingers crossed that these products help.",

For sure I would not go topless now - I don't even look at myself if I can avoid it. I am learning about the micro fat grafting or lipofilling, where they can give you new breasts by liposuctioning the fat from elsewhere and implanting to create breasts. No major surgery.

I sure hope it's not more mets and I hate to learn you are in pain. Hope the docs can getbto the bottom of it and that it is not cancer related. Could it be something like gall stones? I have to admit I've started to worry about Judy. Thought we would have heard from her by now. Amy I hope you are starting your vacation My complaints might seem minor in comparison but this is the only place I have to vent. Emotionally, I still feel like crap - despite the Wellbutrin and the shrink I can't seem to pull myself together and I find myself wanting to become reclusive. So I've seen yet one more dermatologist about my hair - lack of hair and now losing more. This guy is an expert in hair restoration. He says the hair I do have is too damaged and too weak to survive a transplant so there goes one more option. He says between the Taxotere and the Arimidex, they both have contributed to the problem - plus being a second chemotherapy doesn't help because the hair does get damaged with every chemotherapy tx. He actually said I may even lose more hair. He says there is a remote chance that there could be some underlying second reasons that might be able to be treated but he wasn't optimistic. But he did a biopsy on my head (I have stitches in 2 areas in my scalp) and he had me do some additional blood work. I won't get the results until late August because he will be away for a while. So before I can go out of the house, I have to do a major comb over and sprinkle my head with powder to camouflage the baldness. I will never again be able to style my hair. Then I have to put on the compression sleeve and then I have to put my fake boobs on. And because I've gotten so fat, I have barely anything to wear. So that's my story. Thanks for listening.",

I was invited to an event today that he would be attending as a surprise ro him. It was fun and he seemed genuinely happy tom see me - even mentioned me in his speech and made some cute comments. What he wanted to show me the most were pictures of his 2 year old son. It sure is nice for a teacher to see students be so successful",

I was having lunch with my former assistant today and I remembered that she and I always donated through one of our schools to a needy family this time of year instead of exchanging presents. Turns out the people now in our office want their presents and don't want to donate. Then I had an appointment at a little place where I buy my compression sleeves, prostheses, mastectomy bras etc. and it dawned on me that there might be some women who can't afford these things and don't have insurance - government covers a portion but as you all know, this stuff is expensive. So I asked them and they said they have a few who struggle to pay for the prosthesis so I gave them a sum and asked them to put it towards one woman's bill. She is elderly, has no insurance and needs a new prosthesis. While it won't pay the whole thing, it will bring down her bill noticeably. I said that I wanted to remain anonymous - just tell her someone donated \"in the spirit of the season\". These are 2 very nice woman and I trust them. In fact, they were so moved, they gave me a significant discount on the item I had to purchase that won't be covered by government. I felt that donation was something that Lena would appreciate, especially following her bmx.",

I had the port and even though it is painful at first and uncomfortable, it is a much easier way to get through the chemo. It will get more comfortable over time. I also had the 4 tx of TC every 3 weeks. It's not fun but it's doable. The Neulasta or Neupegen - which ever your doc ordered is used with many chemos to try to elevate your white blood count so that you will be less susceptible to infection. It's pretty standard. There is probably a thread for people doing chemo in April 2012 and if you find that thread I expect you will find a very supportive group that will help you through and to manage all the se's. We are the April 2009 group and as you can see there is still a group of us who stay connected. I would be happy to answer any of your questions and I'm sure any of my sisters here as well will share words of wisdom with you at any time. For tomorrow, my advice is to drink lots and lots of water to get the chemo going through your veins and out of your body. Best wishes",

I'm on Metformin - the last round of chemo caused me to become a little bit (if there is such a thing) diabetic. It doesn't help you to lose weight. But it's potentially good for keeping cancer away. I'm reading a book called \"Wheat Belly\" - the doctor who wrote it makes a compelling case for avoiding products made of wheat in order to lose weight. You might want to check it - I bought it at Costco but he also has a Wheat Belly website which has interesting info. I'm sure what I wrote to Pam could have been written by any of you .... but thx ",

I have had 1 little tiny trim and my hair is about 2 - 3 inches long. It is very fine and very thin especially on top. It is dry and lifeless and dull looking. My scalp shows through although I try to hide it as much as I can. I went for a consult re: extensions. I was told by 2 different people at 2 different places that my hair is too fine and extensions won't work well. I have been taking Biotin 2 x a day since I finished rads. When I had my hair done for my son's wedding, the hairdresser put brown eyeshadow all over my scalp to try to camoflauge the baldness. I have been using minoxidil for about 5 months now - I think it helped a little. The dermatologist told me to keep trying for another 6 months. I do go topless and my friends try to be kind but they are lying to try to make me feel better. When I press them, they admit it. I'd rather people just be honest than try to convince me that it looks ok. They are all grateful that it is not them. This was my second chemo. I had FEC the first time and my hair grew back quickly and was thick. I think it's the Taxotere that did me in. I used to have unbelievably thick, curly hair that always looked great. If I was an 82 year old man, my hair would be fine .. but I'm not and it's devastating for it to not grow back. It's one more loss for me.",

I used the Glaxol base cream and it was effective in keeping me from burning badly. I didn't even get very fatigued but I was careful. Geri, thanks for the suggestions. My doctors have been very attentive and I have as much pain meds as I need. Both my GP and my rheumatologist are taking very good care of me. I have an appointment at at Pain Clinic this Friday. But here is where our system has a failure - it is very difficult to get an appointment with a neurosurgeon - takes months and months. But my rheumatologist has taken it upon himself to make contact with colleagues on a personal level and there is an excellent neurosurgeon who has agreed to see me within the next few weeks. It would be ideal if I could be seen within days but I'll accept this. I don't need approval from any insurance company - it's just that the neurosurgeons are very busy. As far as the pain meds, if I didn't have a GP, I could also go to a walk in clinic or an ER here and they would give me meds as well but fortunately I didn't need to go that route. In terms of diagnostics ... my GP ordered the CT and it was done within about 2 days. The CT recommended MRI and once the paperwork was sent in, I had it within 1 business day. The only real wait was 1 week for the report from the MRI. Basically if a doctor orders  a test or treatment, it gets done. I'm glad I had the bone scan done first as once I knew it wasn't a cancer recurrence, I knew it would be something that could be dealt with. So there is a 1 cm cyst there that is causing all of this problem.  Geri, I hope your bone/hip pain is nothing more than arthritis. Interesting that we now consider this good news.  Amy, please let us know what is happening and how you are doing. Wishing that this gets resolved quickly.  Now that I have watched Downton Abby, it's time to go to sleep. Hope everyone is keeping well.",

It destroys tumours without damaging healthy tissue. Clinical trials will begin this fall. They have been working in this for 10 years and the funds came from our \"weekend to end women's cancers\" which is a 2 day walk that has raised many, many, many millions of dollars. No Susan Komen stuff here. All the money has gone directly to the hospital. Dr. Mak always comes to the events and talks to the participants.

My bridge partner came home on Tuesday afternoon and found her husband dead. Funeral was on Thursday. And lots of tears. I have known both of them for about 30 years as the husband used to coach my son's hockey team. This is my second friend within a few months who has come home to find their husband. The first one was 62. This one was 65. Much too young. Judy, good to hear from you and please keep us posted on your sister's progress. Michele so good to hear that you are feeling back to your old self. I hope one day I can say the same. Just keep doing those good things. I go back to PS again tomorrow morning. I'm afraid there has been no progress with the healing. I hope I don't start to cry tomorrow.",

For the past year I have had to wear the kind of hairpiece that you describe because I can't cover the bald spots anymore. I used Minoxidil for almost 2 years but it didn't make a difference. I have seen doctors who specialize in this problem and have had a biopsy. Certainly the second chemo damaged the hair follicle down to the root so even the hair I have is now fine and limp. I've been taking Biotin orally for 3 - 4 years but see no difference. The kicker is that I have been losing more and more hair which I believe is a se of Arimidex. I found a hairdresser who specializes in thinning hair and I've been using special shampoos. But if I find biotin shampoo I will give it a try. I am hoping I can get off Arimidex after 5 years which would be next August. Maybe some hair will grow back. Oh, and I've been using a laser comb too. Judy, how are you doing?",

I'm going through that \"shed\" phase where I have actually lost more hair from it but apparently that is a sign that it is working. I'm still hoping that it will help with the bald spots.  but I think I have to give up the dream of ever having my hair grow back the way it was. This is just so hard. No one ever said my hair might not grow back. I really don't know what to do next. The weather is warming up and I can't keep wearing the hats I have. I need a miracle at this stage. I'm still so upset from yesterday I want to cry. Maybe I should explore that laser - if it would make the hair I do have grow, then I could have extensions but it is soooo expensive. I should have asked the guy to give me some references for that treatment ... but I didn't like him at all so maybe there is another place in the city that does that.",

My hair (I hate to call it hair) is very fine and very thin and very sparse so my scalp does show all over the crown. But it grew somewhat so yesterday I went for a trim and colour to get rid of the gray. As she was finishing up my hair I burst into uncontrollable tears. It was my first time at a hairdresser in a year and half and secondly, it doesn't seem that I will ever have much hair again. So looking in the mirror is difficult as I'm just not the same person anymore - not emotionally and not physically. The man I had been seeing for the few years before bc, was 10 years younger than me. And even though he promised to stay with me he did disappear .... and maybe he wasn't worth it but it's very hard to lose a person who you care about because you got sick.

I guess I felt that I had had my share and had been strong and work through the problems. My marriage ended in divorce - he was very emotionally and mentally abusive and had started being physically abusive as well to the kids ... so even though I was feeling downtrodden and weak, I pulled myself up and did what I needed to do to end the marriage. It wasn't easy but it was the right thing to do for me and for my children. I focused on them and built a career. My parents died. Had my heart broken several times - each time I thought it was ok to trust a man. Then had bc ... got through it .... stayed strong......so now I'm older (aka mature???)... was thinking time to enjoy my \"golden\" years... kids are launched, had relationship that I thought was working - had gone very slow - starting to think retirement... and bang - bc again!!! worse this time ... so many permanent side effects, surgeries etc. and relationship ends badly (because of bc).... I think I'm worn out from being strong and working through life's problems... I reached my limit. It just feels too hard now. I've given up on thinking that everything works out eventually ... it just is what it is and this is my life.",

I think I would feel better if I lost weight. I think I mentioned that the chemo turned me into a diabetic and I've been going to classes to learn more about it ... it all sux...but I have to change my mindset. So I am declaring now - to you  - my very dear friends - that starting tomorrow I'm going to get serious about exercise and healthy eating. I have a little bit of junk food in the house (not much - honestly) and I'll get rid of it today. I need to lose 66 pounds. It seems like such a big hill to climb but maybe when I read about your efforts, it will motivate me. Hugs to everyone.",

Then add to that the issues we then have with recovery, relationships, work, financial etc. etc. ... it is quite normal. She said that more women are expressing these feelings (of depression) as a result of more women living longer following a dx of bc. (I guess that was good news). I've been sliding backwards for a while. She is hoping that the Wellbutrin will push me forward so that I can start taking better care of myself. She feels that it is a long term commitment - at least 8 months. Too soon to say if it has any impact but I'm hopeful. She also added this this is the only anti-depressant that helps with weight loss which goes to what you said.",

There's always ups and downs. I find the Wellbutrin to be helpful so I'll stay on it for a while now. Work is crazy busy -- nutty parents, difficult teachers, challenging kids .... every day there's another issue. On one hand it is a distraction so I don't get time to think about myself but  it's so busy that I don't have time for myself either. I'm starting to think that maybe this should be my retirement year. I'm also in the middle of a little renovation - getting a new kitchen as well as a new ensuite bathroom - very exciting - but during it, lots of mess. I don't like pink month -- like everyone should be happy because it's a happy colour. People don't realize there is still no cure. This morning I watched \"Living Proof\" - about the doctor who created Herceptin and the struggles he went through to get it approved. I cried while watching it. I  think the memories are still to raw for me. Hope everyone has a great weekend.",

I've been to a dermatologist and used Minoxidil for about 6 months. I have been using Biotin 2x a day since I finished chemo. My onc said that the Taxotere can cause permanent hair loss and she has other patients like me. I'd love to go back to a short, cute haircut but my hair is so so so thin that my scalp shows through. I've had only 1 little trim since I finished chemo (June 2009) so not only am I half bald but the growth is very slow. If I cut it short, I would not even be able to do a little comb over. As well the hair I do have is damaged in that it has no body and just lies flat. I had thick, thick curly hair with lots of body. I used to complain about the curls but I'd give anything to have it all back. Every time I see myself in the mirror I wonder who that old (fat)bald lady is. It sure doesn't look like me. I've started Rehab. There is a new program here for bc patients - current and past. At the Toronto Rehab Hospital they offer a 4 month program that includes an assessment, then an exercise prescription. I can go two times a week and there is a wonderful woman there - don't know her background....nurse maybe? Physio maybe? Anyway, they understand everything about the lymph nodes, scar tissue etc. During the training she gives a lot of individual attention and encouragement. They also bring in dieticians, social workers etc. It includes aerobics as well as resistance training. It seems like a great opportunity - no cost - paid for by our universal health care system. I won't be able to go 2 x a week as most of the classes are during the day when I'm at work but on Tuesdays it's in the evening. And I have \"homework\" to do between classes. It's late ... time for bed. I have to meet with angry parents in the morning. They actually threatened a vice-principal and police had to be called.",

I don't think I can do 3 or 4 more years. It's taking too much out of me. At one time, I used to thrive on the action. Now I dread it. I need more time to just take care of me.  So yesterday I had a meltdown too. I had to go to the hospital for the Lymphedema clinic and I had a requisition from my family doc for a fasting blood sugar test. Since my left arm is swollen and the veins in my right arm have collapsed, drawing blood is a problem. At the hospital (cancer centre) the technicians there are wonderful and they know how to draw blood from me. So after the LE clinic and getting a new Rx for a new compression sleeve I went to the lab. But new policy in place and they can't do blood work unless it's for a doc at the hospital. I was fasting and was stressed and hungry. I had a mini meltdown explaining my problem and worried about what to do next. So I wne to the lab at my doc's building and went in, sat down in the litte cubicle, ready for the blood draw. I asked if the technician if she had a little needle (the butterfly one) and she got difficult and rude.Said she would decide what I needed - that it's her job and I can't tell her what to do. She got nasty. I got nasty back. Then I took my jacket and said that I wouldn't let her touch me. Went to the doc's office - had a big meltdown there. Doc saw me and said I was absolutely correct in what I did. She said she's had lots of complaints about that lab. She thought maybe they could do the blood draw in her office. She checked my arm and said that because there was nothing palpable, that it would be extremely difficult for them to do it and she sent me to a different lab where she promised they would be nice. Finally around 2:30 p.m - hungry, tired, an emotional basket case - got to the new lab and they were wonderful. Asked me what the problem was, used the small needle - respected me and unbelievably got a vein on the first try and I didn't feel a thing - only a teeny tiny bruise left. After all these tx etc. I get very anxious now about blood draws. Does anyone else have the same problem?",

I'm so glad that he is close to you and taking care of you. You've been saying all along that the AI didn't agree with you and feeling good is most important. Hope the drains don't have to stay in too long and that you get your strength back quickly. So far 10 different people have contributed a total $540 towards the new breast cancer clinic. I set the goal for $3000 and I would like to make it. I think that as we get closer to the \"party\" the donations will increase. My colleagues are insisting on this party but keeping it very simple and inexpensive so that folks will donate. Have a good weekend everyone",

I had BM this time as they told me that because of my BRCA2+ status, that I would face this again unless I took drastic measures. I'm still crying a lot and just don't feel as strong as I did last time. Although there are some, I don't think there are many people who go through this two times. I appreciate your response and your understanding. How long did you have between the 2 dx?",

For the first time in my life, I'm not part of it (excluding when I was off for bc tx)  I have been officially retired for 2 days now. It just feels like I'm on a long weekend so far but I already feel less stress and pressure. I think after a couple of weeks when it sinks in that I don't have to go back, it will feel more real. The Toronto International Film Festival starts second week of September and I have a few tickets. Don't know any of the movies but Brad Pitt, George Clooney -- all the big stars will be here in town although I doubt if I'll see anyone \"big\". Weather here is very hot again -- tomorrow will once again be at least 90 F and will feel hotter with the humidex. Probably when it's snowing, I'll be wishing for these hot days again.

In hindsight it was much easier to get through that than this second one. I don't post muc on other threads now either as I find some of the conversations to be very negative --- don't need any of that.  I'm also 63 -- the number is very high - I choke on it and try to avoid saying it.

I did go for a weigh in with the nutritionist today ... in total have lost 7.5 pounds in just over 3 weeks - so it's working. Although I have a mountain of weight to lose and this is just a drop in the bucket but at least it's moving in the right direction. I have given up wheat on my own - not suggested by the nutritionist - but she knows I'm doing it. She's also reading the book Wheat Belly but she doesn't believe there is a \"magic bullet\" to weight loss and I do agree with her but I'm going to keep it up. Also I'm using a website call \"My Fitness Pal\" to track what I eat. It's free and it's an amazing site. She wants me to eat a minimum of 1200 calories a day but if I exercise, I have to eat more. She said it's important to keep powered up so your metabolism works faster. I never believed in this but I am losing so I'll keep going. Hope everyone is having a wonderful long weekend.  ",

Very thin hair, no breasts, fat stomach......I have aged 20 years over the past year and I look like an old lady now.",

I was definitely not last because as I was leaving, there was a whole group of new people in the waiting room. Don't know how many machines this hospital has but definitely at least 2 going at the same time. While we have much to be thankful for with our universal health care, it is not perfect and it can take a long time to get an mri. This doctor put the order in on Friday afternoon and I had the MRI on Tuesday --- so not much of a wait. I hope the same as you - that the surgery will not be needed but definitely for now it's been postponed. ",

To put this surgery into perspective, the discomfort and pain are LESS than the pain I was experiencing over the winter when the situation was at its worst. I'm doing ok. Taking pain meds as I need them but trying not to do too much. Taking it easy --- just staying home and resting. Hopefully tomorrow if the weather cooperates, I'll try to get out for a 10 minute walk. My kids have been good about bringing dinner over and checking up on me. I even took a nap this afternoon.

I say \"I think we're having an earthquake\" and the person on the phone (15 miles away) says \"we are too\" ....it lasted about 10 - 15 seconds. Very scary. My son (the one getting married tomorrow) works in the financial district and their bank is one of the targets during the G20 --- they all thought that maybe it was a bomb. People everywhere evacuated their buildings. Also last night in a home about a mile from me - in a very expensive, exclusive neighbourhood (not mine just close by) there was an arrest - something to do with the G20 and explosives. And this afternoon the underground system (a PATH with lots of commercial space that works through the downtown core) was closed also due to potential terrorist issue. Everyone is furious with the Prime Minister of this country for bringing this meeting to the middle of the city - disrupting lives, putting people in danger and forcing many small businesses to close. No one is getting compensated. My son (the groom) has had to go to work in disguise for the past few days. They were instructed to dress down and look like protestors so they wouldn't be targeted. Anyway, tomorrow is the wedding and I hope there are no earthquakes, no protestors, and that everything goes smoothly. Then the bride and groom will go to Hawaii for their honeymoon and stop in Las Vegas on the way home.",

      "Content": "Jun 26, 2010 08:29AM - edited Jun 27, 2010 07:11PM by hrf Hi everyone. Well the wedding was perfect!!! After all the worries, thank goodness all went well. Since everyone is afraid to go downtown, there was no traffic at all. The downtown core is boarded up and there is a big fence around the area the G20 leaders are meeting. The protestors are out in force as of yesterday (Friday) but our wedding was Thursday and only a few small protests were going on so we stayed away from them. Anyway, the wedding was beautiful. The King Eddy is an old elegant hotel with a long history of exciting events. (John & Yoko stayed there) The room for the ceremony and the reception are amazing with lots of beautiful detail on the walls and ceiling - they just don't make them like this anymore. Lots of beautiful flowers, candlelight and perfect lighting to set the mood. The band got people up and dancing and the food was great. The couple (Matthew and Sara) just radiated love and happiness. There were great speeches (not too long and with enough enough humour to keep people interested). The bridal consultant kept us on track so the evening went smoothly. My grandkids (Hailey 3 and Ryan 5) marched. Hailey had been told to drop the flower petals and she was so committed to doing that that she stopped marching even though Ryan was encouraging her to move - it was quite funny. My older son (their father) had to get down from the chuppa to get them. Rabbi said she was the most committed flower girl ever. It added just a bit of humanity to the service as kids will be kids. They behaved very well during the rest of the evening. Matthew and Sara are leaving for Hawaii later today and are already at the hotel at the airport because the highway is being closed throughout the day to let the dignitaries get to town securely. When we were checking out of the hotel, the Saudis and the Brits were checking in. Obama is staying somewhere else. My close friends were at the wedding so I was able to share the joy with them. Thanks for thinking of me. I took a few pics with my blackberry. If someone tells me how to upload to here, I will show you a pic of the couple. They had professional videographer and photogs so we'll get lots more pictures in the next few weeks.",

Mammograms miss a lot of cancers. And we also know that finding it early is no guarantee of a cure. Being BRCA myself, and being monitored closely for 10 years prior to my first dx and then being even more closely monitored I still got a second dx. We also know that BRCA women can get dx in their 20's and 30's. it is not an old lady disease. And who the h*** wants to go through chemo, rads, and have to take drugs with terrible se's?I hate when idiots get public exposure and give bad information.",

I am reading all the teacher evaluations that the principals sent in - all at the end of the year. The next few weeks will be very quiet and then starting the second week of August it starts picking up again. Normally I wouldn't have time to come to this site during the day. Dinner was fine. I bought organic steaks - so no hormones or antibiotics. More expensive but they were good. Sara brought her computer with lots of honeymoon pics. It was great to see them again. And they are sooooo very happy. The both say the wedding day flew by and they hardly recall it happening .... that was with a year and half of planning!!!! Son number 3 has indicated that he thinks he'll get married in 2 years but I think he needs to propose first. I still seem to have many medical appointments. I'm now alternating between med onc and rad onc. I used to see the surgeon but as she told me, there's nothing more she can do for me. But I also have been going for diabetic education classes, dermatologists (one looks for melanoma and one tries to get my hair to grow) and I see the shrink regularly. Now she thinks I need to consider meds so she is referring me to a psychiatrist. Maybe she's right. So I have far too many medical appointments. Hope everyone is having a good day. ",

I was lightly sedated, doc spoke to me the whole time and I didn't even know it was going in. As others have said, slightly uncomfortable for a week or so and then you get used to it. No question about it - chemo sucks big time. I had FEC first time and TC second time. It's almost 2 years since I finished rads. It is taking me longer to fully recover as I was so shocked by second dx. But overall, ok. As others have said, so much support here from everyone.",

Except for those who are stage 0 or early stage 1, it doesn't seem to make much difference in the treatment. I get the sense from my onc that the key issue is the number of nodes involved. When I have used different calculators to determine the stage, some say 2A, some say 2B and some say 3A.

It's NOT Restorative Yoga which is what I initially was looking for. After 4 months of Therapeutic Yoga, I do feel better - more flexible and stronger - although I guess that's relative considering where I started. I also wear my compression sleeve and the instructor is very knowledge about what I can and can't do and what I should be working on. I highly recommend this type of yoga.",

Women don't generally get monitored until about age 25 (which might be considered late) so she suggested telling about the gene mutation somewhere between ages 18 - 25 when the woman is old enough to understand and make a decision about testing. She also strongly recommended that before telling, it would be wise to meet with a genetic counsellor and make sure that you have all the current information to add to that information. The key question was: \"What is the purpose in telling a young child?\" \"How will that help her?\" IMHO, this is more than the parent wanting to know, it's about taking care of our childrens' mental and emotional health as well. I just recently found out that my son has inherited the gene mutation from me and now there is a 50% chance that he has passed it on to my 2 year old granddaughter. They also got advice from a genetic counsellor and will wait until she is old enough to understand and to make decisions about testing.",

And the treatment is pretty much the same for stage II or stage III. My last tumour was 2.2 cm and I also had 4 nodes and I was told that I was stage II. So don't let the number affect you. Before my surgery the mri indicated the tumour might be as big as 5 cm and I did not have neoadjuvant therapy even though the docs already knew lymph nodes were palpable. Your tumour may, in fact have been much bigger than they originally thought and the chemo shrunk it a lot. I'm sorry that your entire family is going through such a tough time.

It is my understanding that mx or lumpectomy plus rads (& maybe chemo) give the same results. Without staging however, there is no way to identify a 10% recurrence or any percentage. That is based on a full staging - the size of the mass, the pathology of the mass, lymph node involvement, the aggressiveness of the cancer etc. Have you had mri, chest x-ray, CT scan? Is it TN or hormone positive? Her + or - ? Personally, I think you need much more information before you make a decision on the type of surgery. If you start with a lumpectomy and then find there are not clean margins, you can always go the mx route. You really don't need to make such a big decision right away. If you surgeon is not giving you all the information you need, then find another doctor. Best wishes.",

I also knew I had lymph node involvement before surgery -- I was still a stage IIb ..... whether you are a stage II or III doesn't matter much at this point. You will get through the treatment. And until all the tests are done and surgery is completed there is no way of knowing the stage so no point in agonizing. I've heard of some women who, when they cut their own hair, use it to get wigs or hairpieces made. One woman even mentioned having her own hair used to create fringe that was sewn into a baseball cap so it looked very natural.....just a thought. Best wishes. ",

These can or cannot include chest x-ray, bone scan, CT scan, mri. In addition to the biopsy, they help your doctors determine what your treatment plan might be. Depending on your doctor, and the results so far, they may suggest surgery first or in some cases chemo comes before surgery. Not everyone has chemo. Also depending on the full pathology you might also get radiation. So you will see a breast surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist. They each have their own specialty but hopefully they will work together for you. For now just go one step at a time - each case is a little different. Bring any questions here and we will do our best to answer, I learned a lot from these boards and it helped me in my conversations with the docs",

I still hurt from having him abandon me when I needed him. I like the \"no nurse no purse\" phrase .... but here's the issue. All of us here have breast cancer. Some of us will die from it. Some of us will have episodes of illness. Do you think there are men out there who wouldn't touch us with a ten foot pole? ....how much nursing are any of us willing to do for someone? I don't have any answers and I don't know what I would do if I ever decided I wanted to meet men again or had any hope for a love life. I honestly don't know the answer. I suspect that if I found out someone had a big health issue before I started caring about him, I would run the other way. Regardless of the reason, when a man we care about leaves us, we hurt. Sorry that you are going through this, Lisa.",

I don't know about it prevening another breast cancer but I (am BRCA2) had my first bc as a TN. I did have my ovaries removed but not my breasts. Then I got a second bc in my other breast and it was ES+/PR+    If I had removed my breasts at the time of the first bc, there was a 90% less chance of getting the second. Everyone is different but that is my story.",
