I know what you mean about this whole thing not being in my plans for the year!  But here it is, and I think I'm ready to deal with it.  Thank Heavens for the groups on this site -- they've been a wealth of information and I've always found the best way to deal with my fear is to learn as much as possible about something.  Hope you have a nice and relaxing Christmas!",

Thanks for the info on the port/no port issue. I'm supposed to have my port placed on Thursday (provided I get out of NY on time), and the idea of it gives me the heebies, even though I also think it's the best idea. So all the positive info I can get on it is good. Kym61, Steph42, amyK, ScienceGirl and navywife7181: Welcome to the group -- sorry you're here, but so glad we're all in this together and can give eachother much needed support. Kym61: My surgeon had said the same thing about the 2 diff. quadrants when he sched me for the MRI. Turns out it wasn't an issue for me. Good luck (?) on the HER2 tests. From what I gather, it used to be considered bad to have HER2+, but with Herceptin they're apparently getting really good results. amyK: Sorry the healing has taken longer than expected for you. Hope you're feeling better really soon. I'll be doing the DD A/C, too, but just 4 rounds of the Taxol. I've been reading the DD thread and the posts from the ladies on the December group, and it sounds like they're getting through it, although it sounds like it can take it's toll not to have that third week. Anyhow, seems that a lot of ladies are getting the DD, so maybe it's becoming more common. My onc did say we'd have to see how well I tolerate the regimen. ScienceGirl: As drastic as it must be, I'll bet you're relieved you went with the BMX. So glad there was no node involvement for you to keep you at that stage 2 level. Oh yeah, I believe we're going to make it through; maybe not easily, but we'll see the other side of this and beat the beast. navywife7181 & Tundra: Being stuck at the airport is bad enough -- but I really hope the ultra-cold weather goes away for your sakes!

I treated myself yesterday and ordered a bunch of cute bandanas from Traders International.  Had to have the one with hearts and bears on it for Valentine's -- I think the kids at my middle school will appreciate that one.  Now I want to find one with Hello Kitty . . .  My port is marginally less painful this morning, thankfully, and I was able to get some sleep last night, having found a comfortable combination of pillows to keep me from putting too much strain on the port on one side and the re-excision incision on the other.  Warrior Princess: I'm so glad you were able to get on your mom's insurance before your diagnosis -- that's at least one thing that worked out in your favor, for sure.  I'm so sorry the lumpectomies didn't work out.  I haven't been able to bring myself to look at my newest incision, and I'm hoping that this newest chunk being taken out still leaves me with a good result.  As for your treatment regimen, it sounds like what a lot of ladies are getting.  I'll bet that you're scheduled for Adriamycin/Cytoxan (A/C) x 4 and then 12 of one of the taxanes (Taxol or Taxotere).  That seems to be one of the most common combinations that I've seen.  For a very realistic picture of what to expect from chemo, I highly recommend reading the December 2010 chemo thread here at bc.org.  Happy (almost) birthday! Hope your recovery from surgery continues to go well. If any of you are into reading about all this (this is the librarian in me), I found a very informative book called Living Through Breast Cancer by Carolyn M. Kaelin (oncologist and BC survivor, herself).  Lots of good information about dealing with SEs, the many types of surgery we face, the different chemo regimens out there, changes that can occur with skin, hair, mouths, etc.  It's the kind of book you can browse easily, just looking at the info you're interested in, and leaving the overwhelming stuff for later. Anyhow, hope all of you have a great day, and that those of you who've had tx already are feeling good and realatively SE free.",

Congratulations, Blindsided, on your last tx!  I know you must be thrilled.    I had my onc appt. today and got the path report that says while they did find another focal point of DCIS further up the duct, the margin on the other side of that was 2.5 mm, so I'm hoping that will be sufficient to appease my radiation onc.  I see the surgeon tomorrow, and he should be letting me know for sure.  I also had my chemo teach today and was pleased to see that there was nothing new -- I've learned so much from all the people on this site and the discussion boards.  It's been a good education.  But now I'm in kind of a funk -- it's really getting close, and each step makes it that much more real.  It's been so irreal, but I know that the moment I'm in that infusion chair, I can't keep telling myself that this isn't really happening to me.",

Cat123:  How's the hair holding out?  Jane_UK: It is a shock to go from long to short hair.  I did that a month ago and, while I was really worried, I found that I really like my hair short after all.  We have a similar program to the one you described in the US called \"Locks of Love.\"  I've known several girls and ladies who've donated.  Good luck with that 18-yr-old thing!  Sciencegirl:  I loved your son's comment about Hillary Clinton.  That was a riot! All:  Those of you who are taking the L-glutamine; where do you get it?  Is it available at health food stores?  I've looked on the vitamin shelves of drug stores and haven't seen it.  I'd be interested to give it a try if it might help keep mouth sores away. Anniemomofthree:  Cookies sound wonderful! Tammy:  glad your anti-nausea meds kicked in so quickly.  I guess it only takes one time, huh?  I'm gathering that setting an alarm to wake me up throughout the night or remind me during the day to take the meds is going to be a good idea.  I hate not getting uninterrupted sleep, but think I'd rather that than feeling like I'm going to be sick. AliT:  I like your idea of just going ahead and being the one to decide when your hair had to go.  I think, for me, that might be a good option.  I'd rather deal with it on my terms.  So glad you had a great day and that the nurses were so good to you.  Nurses can make all the difference in a doctor's office. MaryMeg:  I, too, have kind of lost heart for my work.  I know there's so much more that I could be doing, but so much of my psychic energy has gone to dealing with this disease that I know my work has suffered.  No worries about babbling - I really enjoy reading your posts! ck_moma:  Welcome!  Glad your first tx went as well as it did.  Will you be following up the AC with Taxol or Taxotere?  Better keep the wig out of your dog's reach - I can just imagine him eyeing it with interest.  LOL! Sylvia62:  Welcome to you, too!  So sorry what you thought you were in for got much worse.  I went through that originally, too.  Thought it was DCIS (only need rads) and post-lump found out it was IDC.  It's like getting a kick in the gut, isn't it?  They really try to be aggressive with what they call \"triple negative\" (HR-/PR- and HER2-) cancers because those don't respond to things like Tamoxifen or Herceptin.  We're going to be on almost the same sched - I just start on the 18th rather than the 19th.  I think a lot of us are just waiting to see if we can continue to work.  I'm hoping to be able to work as much as possible, but am prepared to take as many days off as I have to.  Thankfully, my principal is very supportive and understanding (at least he has been).  Good luck to you! I had lunch with a good friend today and came home and vacuumed and mopped the floors.  I think the cleaning made me feel better, which is a little weird because I really don't much like doing housework (which is actually an understatement).  DH said he'd be happy to do it, but I told him I really wanted to because I just don't know how much energy I'm going to have in a couple of weeks.  Anyhow, it felt good to be active, even if it was just mopping!

Do you have any idea how we're supposed to clean it? Can it go in the washing machine? I couldn't find any care instructions. I ordered my FranceLuxe scarf early this week and am looking forwardto getting that, too. momand2kids thanks so much for your continuing support. All of you who have gone before us are such an inspiration!",

Good luck!  And if any of us can help, don't hesitate to ask.  Feel free to PM if you like.",

Just wish I had more than one week to feel like this.  ProudMom: I'm so sorry you were feeling so bad earlier. Of course you can vent -- and I share your love of the word \"crappy\" -- it just seems to fit so much of what is happening to us. And it is exhausting keeping up the good front -- which is part of the reason when folks at school asked how I was doing, with many of them I told them exactly how I was feeling. I guess I figure if they're going to ask, I'm going to be honest, and if they don't really want to know, they'll quit asking. Those who truly care will continue to ask. I'm glad you're looking into paring back. I love what MaryMeg and AimeeMac had to say about our main job is to heal. After all, that's why we're going through this \"crappy\" chemo for. Take time for yourself, do something YOU enjoy because you want to, and know that the outside world will take care of itself for awhile. I sympathize with your dislike of asking for help -- I have had a problem with that my whole life. Somehow we'll figure out how to ask, I guess. Let us know how you're feeling. We're here for you. Queenjazz: I know I've read on other discussion boards (probably the December or November board) that others were dealing with vision issues. I looked in my Living Through Breast Cancer book and there was no mention of vision problems. Also, no mention of such problems in the information sheets I got at the onc's office. But obviously there's something going on for so many to be experiencing it. UTMom: You are so right, it is way too soon. I've lost another couple of pounds and don't really feel like I'm eating any less than I was before. Everything I've read says we should eat what we feel like so if that ravioli and ice cream sounds good, I say, \"go for it.\" My problem is almost nothing sounds good, although I did find that 5 Guys Burgers and Fries' french fries were really appetizing this weekend . . . bdavis: Good luck with the Neulasta. I'm taking off work the day after my shot next week because of how miserable I felt that day last tx, so I sympathize -- and I was taking the Claritin. I may have to move to something stronger than ibuprofen. It took me until today (day 8) to really get rid of all the pain, so I wouldn't be surprised if you were still feeling the pain yesterday.hsgray: How's the cough doing? Did you have to follow up on it? Hope you're feeling OK. lorenar: Welcome to our little community -- hope you're able to draw some strength from us here! How are you feeling today? Hope the nausea was minimal for you. Are you doing one of the taxanes or the AC to start with? Looks like you'll also be doing Herceptin like I will. Check back in and let us know how you're doing. MaryMeg: Nanaimo bars -- wow, I haven't heard anyone else talk about those since I left the Pacific NW 20 years ago, although I do have an Oregon cookbook that has a recipe for them. amelia2: Glad your rash is doing better! Did your doc think it was from the Taxol (Taxotere?) or the Herceptin? I've heard the Herceptin can have allegy-type reactions. Beckie: Yay!! You sound great, and already on your feet doing hair. I don't know how you do that when you're perfectly healthy (standing all day like that) and I think it's wonderful that you feel up to it now. Anniemomofthree: We can take all of the drugs at once? That could be useful when I'm trying to sleep off my SEs next Wednesday and Thursday! I'll be pulling for you to have many fewer than 12 days of bad SEs next round. How nice that your onc is working so hard to get your SEs under control. And good luck with the disability. I would seriously have considered it but I don't have short term disability insurance and I can't afford the leave without pay until long term would kick in at 90 days. Kym61: Good luck getting in to the office tomorrow. Seems like it has done nothing but snow in your neck of the woods since Christmas. Pumpkin roll sounds good (one of the few things that does!). jcoutee: Welcome to you, too! Glad you found us. Have you checked out the TN discussion board? They seem to be really active. (I originally thought I was going to be TN based on the needle biopsy -- that changed, though.) Looks like you and Moe are doing the same protocol (Taxol followed by AC). AimeeMac: Your husband's comment took my breath away. It is support like that that we all need. What an amazing thing. Truly. And good reminder from your friend. Sounds like you have a wonderful support system!",

Not a funny subject necessarily, but he was always able to find the humor in his situation and I found myself laughing out loud a number of times, notably in the infusion chair last week.

I went to the doc today about my eyes and he reiterated that dry eyes can be a problem and that my ongoing sinus problems contribute to this problem. He said I should start to use the natural tears eyedrops regularly. I'll see if that helps. My head has started itching a lot. I figure this is a precursor of things to come . . . Anyhow, I've planned to shave my head this weekend, so my scarves are ironed and ready to go. Tomorrow is a \"caps for a cause\" day at school (middle school kids pay $1.00 to be allowed to wear the hat of their choice), so I'm planning to debut a little red velvet hat I bought a month or so ago. They'll be seeing more of it in the weeks and months to come! SSIrish: So glad you decided to jump into the conversation --but certainly sorry you're here to begin with. Hope you're feeling well this third day of the cycle. Maybe the intestinal issues won't be quite as bad this time around. It's crummy to have had to go through chemo on your birthday! I'm with WebU, I loved your comment about Rhoda -- I used to watch that all the time when I was a girl. I always thought she looked pretty chic in her scarves! Emend is a great drug -- I was glad I'd had it for tx 1. I think I would have been much sicker without it. Glad you qualified for the ACT program -- it will make things a lot easier, for sure. Moe0279: Bad news about the neuropathy -- hopefully the feeling will come back for you once the txs are over. How are you feeling today? Hope the fatigue has eased up for you. Beckie: Sorry your 5th day wasn't as good as hoped -- has today been better? How did the wig shopping go? And I agree, BC sucks, big time! MaryMeg: Hope you're feeling OK today. My onc's office doesn't have wi-fi for it's patients (I don't think -- they haven't in the past when my DH was going for tx), so I sympathize with your frustration. I'll join the \"pathetic club,\" MaryMeg. Thankfully it doesn't bother me -- it just lets me know they sympathize/empathize/are sorry I have to deal with this. What did bother today was when a co-worker told me today that he knew \"exactly what I was going through\" because his 1st wife many years ago spent a lot of months going through Hodgkin's treatment . . . I am sorry he had to deal with that, but he can not know exactly how I'm feeling until he's sat in that infusion chair himself . . . even then, he'll never have to worry about losing his breasts, and a bald man is much more accepted than a bald woman. Otherwise he's been very supportive of my situation. Hate to complain, but, really . . . AimeeMac: I love the NW -- grew up in Oregon and went to school at the U. of Puget Sound. I'm jealous of you getting to live in the Seattle area! (Even though I don't miss the many months of grayness . . .) I looked up my recipe for Nanaimo Bars and it's pretty much the same, but instead 1/4 C of butter it calls for 1/2 C. Pretty rich stuff! navywife: Happy birthday! Just wish you didn't have to spend it getting chem . . . Hope you're feeling better -- glad you didn't have to spend more time in the hosp! The Neulasta does cause pain, but, as with so much, some tolerate it better than others. I had quite a bit of pain and am not looking forward to it againg, but would rather that, I think, than spend time in the hospital. Lorenar: Hope you have been well today. Don't forget to take your advice and don't push too much, and be careful out in the snow! :-) My parents have a house in near Martinsburg, but they spend winters in Florida because they couldn't take the snow any more. ProudMom: Glad you're feeling better! Remember that steroids can really mess with our emotions, too. Take care, and vent if you need to! amelia2: If you are able to \"go commando,\" let us know. I'm considering it, but don't know how knobby my head is going to be without hair. It would take guts not to have some sort of covering, and I don't know if I have that many. Good for your son! Have a lovely weekend. sciencegirl: Yes, why don't they let us sleep in on snow days? My district during the last snow \"event\" had the decencey to call school off the evening before, but they're not usually that considerate. Thank you for your thoughts about the future. Not only for those of you with children, but for all of us, as well. We are all young enough that advances in 10 or 15 years will have an impact for us, as well, should we ever have to deal with recurrence. And \"keep smiling, or not\" -- such an appropriate sentiment, because we do need to allow ourselves those days when smiling is just too much to contemplate. Thank you. webu: What a relief to be done with the mouth sores -- those are so painful anyway, I can only imagine the chemo induced ones are miserable. I'm actually looking forward to wearing my Gaila, too. They really are cute, and certainly not in my \"usual' wardrobe!",

I have to say I love reading what you all have to say -- both good and bad.  I hate that so many of us are having a hard time of it, but it feels good to know that none of us is alone -- we have each other for support and understanding, and that means so much. Thank you, Annie, for your milestones.  While we're not getting snow this time around in SC (be safe, y'all), it has been much colder for us than normal for longer than normal, and it's nice to think that spring really IS just around the corner.  Definitely something to look forward to. I have been sleeping in a cap that one of my mom's friends knitted for me.  It's knitted from a really soft, fuzzy yarn and doesn't have any elastic but just pulls down over my head, like a stocking cap.  Patterns are available on the web for \"cancer hats\" if you or someone you know knits, webu.  Also, the newer style fleece hats might be more comfortable than the cap you were trying to sleep with. I buzzed my hair to a 1 on the clipper guard, and I expect that will all come out in time, too.  TMI, maybe, but for those reading who are new to the whole experience you'll need to know, my pubic hair has really started coming out, so I figure the rest won't be too far behind.  I'm really not looking forward to my nose hair coming out -- I hear the runny nose that results is annoying.  And I'm stuffy all the time (I own two cats and am allergic . . .), so I need to get used to carrying tissue with me at all times so I'm not using my sleeves.  Anyhow, just more on the list of annoyances, big and small, that we get to deal with. Good luck with the SEs, everyone.  I think I'm off to nap the AC off . . . (if the decadron will let me).",

UTMom:  Glad you're back on track -- hope nothing gets in the way of your next four tx.  My eyebows and eyelashes started to come out about the 2nd taxol tx and finished falling out after the last.  But, 7 weeks PFC my brows are about 1/3 of the way back and my lashes about the same.  Tammy:  I had 20/33 rads yesterday, and that was the first time I felt tired enough to need to take a nap; but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't have continued had I been at work.  My skin just started to get red this week, although I have had a lot of discomfort with my nipple since the first tx -- can't sleep on my stomach.  No bad skin issues yet.  I have been using a thin film of aquaphor daily since my second week and twice daily starting a week ago Wednesday.  My RO said to apply it right before bed to start and said if it hadn't absorbed by the morning, I was using too much.  It's an annoyance having to go every day, but that's really the worst so far. My hair, 7 weeks PFC, is about 1/3\" long and I gave up my headcoverings a couple of weeks ago.  It feels so good, now, not to be wearing anything to cover up.  It felt strange and naked at first, but I finally just said WTH.  I have gotten \"looks,\" but mostly from younger kids who are obviously curious.  No adult has given me anything resembling a \"pitying\" look.   My husband has even said it's going to be strange to see me with hair, since I've been walking around home since late January completely uncovered.  I will say, the hair on my crown is fairly dark, but I think the hair on the side of my head is coming in gray, and I'm not thrilled at that, being only 45, but I guess that's what hair coloring is made for.",

Physically, I'm doing OK.  My arms and hips still bother me -- my range of motion is limited -- and I think I may need some physical therapy.  It just seems to have settled in my joints.  My onc says it is not unusual for people to report feeling a lot older after chemo.  I guess I can live with it, especially as I'm not interested in taking any more medicine that aspirin or ibuprofen and my weekly Herceptin tx (lasting until March). My first mammogram post-chemo will be November 8th.  I know until I get the results that day I will be on tenterhooks, but, as my RO says, it's highly unlikely that anything could have survived the chemo/radiation onslaught I gave it this spring.

My husband and I have spent the summer dealing with a recurrence of his Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  It's a scary thing when this beast comes back.  Thankfully, his is very localized, and his onc feels that he will be well-served with the excisional biopsy he had early this month and an upcoming course of radiation.

ProudMom:  It is scary, isn't it?  But you're right, the support on this network is phenomenal!  And we will always have each other to sound off to -- to commiserate, to complain, to rejoice when things go well, and to cry with if it ever seems more than we can handle. Tundra:  Welcome!  It's all a whirlwind, isn't it?  And not a good one, I know.  We'll need you to be our resident expert on Taxol, since you're starting it first!  Good luck -- I'll be thinking of you next week.  Check back and let us know how it goes, OK? islandmom: Have you heard anything about a second opinion?  I know what you mean about it seeming like overkill, I wondered that, too.  But my onco explained it really well, saying it's a lot like putting down weedkiller for dandelions.  You may not see any weeds growing, but if the seeds have spread, you want to make sure you get them before they're grown.  He said the invasive cancer is like that -- you may not have any nodes postive, and there may not be any other evidence of tumors, but if any of those cancer cells have gotten into the bloodstream, the only way to catch them is with \"weedkiller.\"  I guess I'm more of the \"better safe than sorry\" school -- I want this to be the one and only year I ever have to deal with this monster. Well, my best to all of you over the holidays!",

Mine is a power port, too.  My surgeon put in a small one, because I'm small (4'10\"), so I gather there are different sizes.  It's centered about midway between my collarbone and my right breast (the BC is in the left side), with the line going from the port to my jugular vein (but that's not too obvious).  There is a noticeable lump, although it's a lot smaller than my husband's port, which is a good inch or more across and you can really see the line running from the port to his vein.  I know, the whole idea kind of gives me the creeps, but from what I gather it's a lot easier to stick the port than it is to try to stick a vein each time, and with a year's worth of herceptin ahead of me, I really don't want them to have to try to find a good vein each week. Apparently, though, it's also very easy to take out when they don't need it any more, so it's definitely not permanent.",

Good luck with the port placement. It can be painful at first, but gets better in a few days. I hear that days 3 & 4 on the AC are the roughest, so I'm planning to take them off from work for my first round, anyway, to give myself the space to deal with it if necessary. UTMom2014: Good for you for walking afterwards -- I'm hoping to be able to do that. I'm not an active person normally, but I would really like to do something, maybe get back into some yoga at the \"Y.\" Did they do the Emend in an IV? Iasked my chemo nurse about it, and she said they always go with the pill form of Emend. I suspect that's so that we bear the burden of the cost, and not the cancer center. Seems like the IV would be more effective. Were you able to keep the nausea at bay? moe0279: Maybe you'll get lucky with your hair -- that would be one nice surprise in a long list of bad ones. AliT: were you able to begin your treatment on Wednesday? Hope the infection cleared up in time. MaryMeg: Were you able to sing your solo today? (Yesterday for you?)  How have you been post-treatment? JeanH: Hope your cold clears up soon. My parents (in Florida) have bad ones and sound miserable, and my assistant at work is getting over the flu. 'Tis the season for them, isn't it? My grade was given in both my core needle biopsy and the path report from the lumpectomy. Here is something I found online that describes the different grades. Do any of them resemble any of the parts of your report?Grade 1 (lowest) Well-differentiated breast cells; cells generally appear normal and are not growing rapidly; cancer arranged in small tubules. Grade 2 Moderately-differentiated breast cells; have characteristics between Grade 1 and Grade 3 tumors. Grade 3 (highest) Poorly differentiated breast cells; Cells do not appear normal and tend to grow and spread more aggressively. amyK: How are you feeling a few days out from your tx? Have you been able to keep things under control? The closer I get, the more trepidation I feel. As always, it's the not knowing that's the worst. islandmom: How wonderful for you that you were able to go to your son's confirmation. Islandmom - 1, Chemo - 0! jcornes: With any luck (for you!) you won't need to join us. Good luck! ProudMom_Wife: When my DH was on chemo, he had a very bad time with constipation -- one particularly bad episode where we thought we would have to go to the hospital. Anyhow, as a natural alternative to the chemical laxitives, his chemo nurses recommended warm prune juice with a sliver of butter. Sounds gross, but he swears by it now. I'm up for anything, and a natural solution is a good one for me. Your DH sounds like a wonderful support.  AmyMac: Welcome! Just wish we all could meet under better circumstances. Another lady on the board is also havin the T+Carb -- Steph42. Not sure if she's still with us or not . . .? So glad you're having minimal SEs -- hope that continues for you. I, too, am considering going drastic with hair color. I got my hair cut very short a few weeks ago and think I'll color it just before my first tx. I had a couple of girls at my middle school say I should dye it jet black and get some piercings . . . But I was thinking white blonde or bright red. I'll only have it for a couple of weeks after, so why not? Best of luck to our Monday starters: WarriorPrincess24, anniemomofthree, and lee7.

I'm vegetarian, so soy is a big source of protein for me . . . I was so excited this moring to hear that Michael Douglas was tumor-free. Good for him! It is a lot of weight to lose, but I don't think it's unusual. We need to make sure we're getting enough protein and good calories -- must be hard to do when everything tastes off and our stomachs are queasy.  Small meals and good snacks throughout the day is what I've heard helps.  Looking at my notes, doesn't look like any of us are starting tomorrow.

It's good that you didn't have too much nausea, but sorry you're getting the mouth sores. Have you tried the baking soda/salt/water rinse? I tried it, but the thought of using it makes me gag at this point, so I just can't face it.  I've read women who swear by it, though, and my chemo nurse gave me the recipe, so it must work. It's just 1 Tbs of baking soda, 1 tsp of salt, and warm water. Tastes awful, though, at least as far as I'm concerned, but I've never been able to stomach gargling with salt water, either. I was able to get some l-glutamine capsules at our local health food store and have been opening those up, mixing the contents with water, and rinsing with that then swallowing. My mouth (tongue esp.) is tingling, but no sores yet. Another thing I use right before bed is the Biotene gel (not just the rinse). It's kind of like eating a mouthful of vaseline, but it does moisturize the mouth before going to sleep. Proud_Mom: I have been keeping a record of everything I eat and when I take the meds -- can't see any patterns yet since it's really too early, but I can see that I don't know how I'll ever survive on what I have been able to eat!  I got the weight boost from the steroids and that's coming down now, so some small consolation. Betsey: Hope the Neulasta pain never got above a dull ache for you. No, thrush looks like white patches all over your mouth and throat and hurts like the worst sore throat you've ever had. I remember feeling like I was swallowing past razor blades when I had it. Hope yours doesn't go that direction! Heather: Sorry you had such a pincushion day. Makes me very happy I have the port. Thank god for the vein ninja! Good luck with the queasiness. Small meals more frequently eaten is supposed to help. Do I detect a note of sarcasm in your inquiry into what might be making you feel cruddy? I just felt like hell yesterday and found myself apologizing to my DH for how \"unfun\" I'm going to be for the next few months. He is such a sweetie, just reassured me that the most important thing right now is getting through this, and we can \"worry\" about fun in about 16 weeks. He's been here, he does understand, and that may be the only way I consider myself lucky here -- at least he's never going to lose patience with how I'm feeling. Doing better today, at least for now. Just wondering how going back to work on Monday is going to go . . .",

Seriously, constipation is terrible, especially when one is used to being really regular. Hope that's better now. I feel bad that you had to go through the hair loss at the hospital, instead of being able to deal with it how you would have preferred. Those franceluxe wraps are nice, though, aren't they? Now you need to sleep -- as much as possible, probably, to get your strength back. I'll be thinking of you! Beckie: Wow -- now that's a productive first tx! :-) Did the Lunesta put a dent in the steroids? Good luck with the neulasta today. AliT: Another beautiful picture from one of our January sisters! The Neulasta is painful. I'm just starting to see a lessening of the pain this morning from my shot on Wed. Easily the thing that makes me feel the worst. I didn't get any headaches, thankfully. Hope yours have gotten better. Welcome cblue715: Sorry your first tx ended up in such an uncomfortable place. My DH had the same problem when he was going through tx. Be sure to get that stool softener in, it should help. Also, and I know I keep saying this, but warm prune juice with a sliver of butter melted in it is an excellent natural way to go to help constipation. Not too appetizing, but DH and his chemo nurse swear by it. Good luck with next week! suz3: Good luck today -- here's hoping you feel as good as every other day since tx#1. webu: Sorry about the port! Did they say whether or not they would expect this to be an ongoing problem? I hope not, for your sake! Hope the Leviquin makes a difference -- that's a high powered one, from what I hear. baf4292: I'm beginning to envy your cipro regime. This bone pain is miserable. Hope you have a wonderful time at your son's birthday dinner, and good luck with the buzz tomorrow!",

For the nausea I had the tri-fold Emend pack from which I took the first pill on the day of the tx and pills two and three on the day after and the third day.  They gave me Decadron and Aloxi in IV the day of tx and at home I've had Compazine and Ativan in addition to the Emend.  I haven't hesitated to take the Compazine; the first four days I was taking it pretty much every four to six hours.  The day after tx I took an Ativan in the middle of the day and took an Ativan every night with the Compazine from Tuesday through Friday nights. I've also had ginger ale to drink (just realizing I didn't get any at the store today . . .) plus ginger tea.  I've also really tried to eat small amounts throughout the day, even though nothing sounded good.  I've read that small meals (hardly a meal, just something to put in my mouth) throughout the day is a good idea, because you really don't want to let your stomach get empty.  I've been queasy, but thankfully have not thrown up (I REALLY don't do well with vomit . . .).  There hasn't been a day when my stomach hasn't felt like it was on the edge.  I also haven't tried to do much (pain wouldn't really let me) during the day.  Easy because I took the time off from work and I don't have kids and my DH has done all his own cooking. I have also read that the younger you are, the worse the nausea tends to be.  Under 50 seems to be the cutoff I've seen.  Now, I'm under 50 (almost 45 here), but I'm not as young as you.  I've lost about four pounds this week, but at 4'11\", I can afford to lose some weight and not have it be a big problem. My franceluxe headwrap is a melange of greens and aquas in a paisley pattern.  Really quite lovely.  I do wish they weren't as expensive as they are, I'd get a few more because they had so many pretty patterns. Hang in there -- Wednesday night I, too, asked my DH if this was going to be worth it because I felt like hell.  Of course I know it is, but I'm a week and a half from my next tx and I'm already dreading it. ",

Most of the nausea and pain are gone, so I was able to go pretty much at top speed until about 2:00 when I went back and worked at my desk. As always, I think it was good to get back and keep myself busy. sciencegirl: I know you can make it --we all can. It might not be easy, but every day we're getting there. I agree about the mammogram baseline age. The earlier we catch it, ultimately the less it will cost, if cost is the major issue. I happen to think that catching it early is reason enough.Kym61: Hope your new haircut is easy for you to get used to. I was just talking to my DH about shaving my head this weekend. I like the idea of my deciding when it's going to go and I think it's time. Crummy deal about the period! I would think if we do go into chemopause, since there won't be a period all the junk that goes along with it should go away too. Of course, we may be trading bloating and cramps for night sweats and hot flashes . . . hsgray: Those anti-nauseals do wipe you out, don't they? The Ativan I take is especially sleep-inducing. I am finally starting to feel hungry, day 6 post-tx, but a lot of things (like chocolate), aren't all that appealing anymore. I suppose that's going to get worse as treatment continues? Glad you and Kym didn't have horrible Neulasta pain and that you were able to sleep, finally. moe0279: Good luck with the neuropathy -- wish I had some advice other than to make sure your doc is aware of it.AimeeMac: I've always heard that the SEs are cumulative, so I guess I'm expecting things to get worse; at least the fatigue side of things. Anyone else who can speak to this? I love the Wilson and Annette Benning references, ladies! What was up with her last week? Anyhow, I'm amazed at how ratty my short hair looks when I get up in the morning, although I will say that a brush through it usually does an OK job of straightening it out. I'm off to cook my DH some dinner -- I think I should while I feel up to it. He's really not much of a cook . . .(big understatement). Hope everyone has a good day tomorrow!",

I'll see what happens.  This Herceptin is the first of 52 weekly -- guess I'll have to make it a habit. For those with hand issues from the AC, it's what's known as hand/foot syndrome.  It happens when the capillaries in the hands/feet break and allow the Adriamycin to leak into the tissues.  It causes pain, itching, peeling, and in severe cases bad, supurating blisters.  It can hold up tx or cause tx to need to be stopped completely if it happens in earlier tx.  I had that last week and my hands were miserable this weekend.  Got some hydrocortisone hand cream to use and it's much better now.  My onc confirmed what I had found online, that now that the Adriamycin is done, it shouldn't be a problem.  Apparently the Taxol doesn't cause it the way the Adriamycin does. I have a MUGA scan scheduled for Monday next.  Can anyone tell me anything about the process?  How long it lasts?  What to expect? My periods, too, have stopped completely.  The last was Jan. 13, just before my first A/C tx.  I've been wondering if it's going to be permanent, too.  At 45, I guess I wouldn't mourn its loss all than much.  I'm only 1% ER+ and don't know if Tamoxifen is in my future or not.  Guess I'd better ask the onc about that. ",

As for the nausea, with me it was constant and the time it lasted got longer with each tx.  By the end I was on Emend, Zofran, Pfenergan (I had to stop the Compazine because I started having uncontrollable spasms in my legs and feet) and Ativan just at night.  I would take some combination of all of these for nearly a week and then stopped so that I could function at work the next week.  The nausea that second week was still there, but would subside into the background eventually. The thing about food was that I never felt hungry on AC.  I knew I was, but I just didn't feel it, if that makes any sense.  Once I ate, I felt better, but getting that first bit of food into my mouth was a struggle.  Starchy foods were the most appealing, but by my fourth AC tx in my off week I was actively craving protein.  I think I was living on string cheese.  Sweets are almost completely unappetizing to me right now and I normally LOVE donuts, ice cream, and, especially, chocolate.  I MISS chocolate, but it just doesn't taste right.  Maybe by Easter . . . AC is hard.  You may feel like quitting (I sure did), but you can get through it.  Just hang in there and remember we're here for you.",

When I told him today, he said it was probably not neuropathy, but said it could be a couple of other things: 1.  The catheter from my port might possibly have migrated from where it is supposed to stay into the artery supplying my arm, or 2.  Possibly a blood clot (less likely). He's scheduled an ultrasound (to rule out the blood clot) and a chest x-ray (to check on the catheter). Have any of you, in your readings around this site and elsewhere or in your discussions with your oncs, run into any mention of this? I'd love to say just take the *%$* thing out, but I really need to keep it for the next 8 months while I get the Herceptin tx. Because the fun never ends . . .",

Welcome Marcia.  Glad you've joined this group that no one wants to be a part of, but it's good to have you here.  My head was cold last night in my bedroom (so much so I had to wear a cap all night), so I can only imagine what it feels like up in your neck of the woods.  Lorenar:  The Biotene really does work -- I don't much like the after taste, but it makes the dryness better.  Also, the gel is good right before you sleep.  Just put a little in your mouth and smoosh it around your teeth, cheeks, and roof of your mouth.  It keeps the mouth moisturized throughout the night. sciencegirl:  My head feels pretty good, actually.  And I was surprised at how soft the stubble is.  Don't know why I was surprised, thinking about it, it's not like it felt like beard hair when it was long!  It actually feels kind of velvety when you rub with the grain, so to speak. We went to lunch yesterday afternoon and then last night to Barnes & Noble and I didn't feel too self-conscious. The scarf got a little warm and I was happy to be able to just take it off when I got home.  Hope your buzz goes well, whenever you decide you're ready.  MaryMeg:  Sleep would be welcome, I'm sure.  Hope you're able to get something to help you feel less zombie-like soon. NancyFL:  Glad your SEs have been so manageable.  Hope it continues for you! Moe:  I had that shaky feeling after just one AC tx.  Could it have something to do with your fatigue?  I know I get the shakes when I'm bone-tired, and you sound like you're at that point.  Get lots of rest, if you can.  Take care! slcst:  Good luck this week!  They adjusted your anti-nausea regimen, didn't they?  Hope that makes a huge difference for you.  It's scary going into the 2nd tx, knowing we're going to feel pretty rotten and knowing that we still need to do this.  Usually, our instincts tell us to run away from things like this that hurt us, and here we are, voluntarily putting ourselves in the infusion chair.  So, as I'm typing this post I look over on the floor and the little white, fuzzy cap I left on my bed when I got up is sitting on the middle of the floor.   I think my cats have been after it.    Must have looked like a great cat toy!",

So, the chemo probably doesn't help, and I've read a lot of posts reminding us to remember that the steroids we get w/ the tx can wreak havod with our emotions -- think of athletes and 'roid rage. So, cry when you need to, and realize that it will probably get easier eventually. Also, a note on the neuropathy. If you have tingling or pain, don't hesitate to let your onco know. My husband was on the drug Velcade for his lymphoma and that is also notorious for causing neuropathy. Our onco was very responsive when he found that my DH was starting to feel it and, if the lymphoma hadn't gone into (essentially) remission, he would have stopped the treatments and changed to a different drug. DH still has bad pain in his feet, 3 years later, so don't let it get bad. The docs want to know when it's happening. And please, you NEVER have to apologize for complaining. That's what this forum is for -- for us to air our feelings (good, bad, hopeful, angry, depressed, funny) as we take this journey. There will never be anyone would judge you for letting your feelings out. baf4292: So glad you had a good experience with the wig shopping, finally. The last thing any of us needs is to be stonewalled at an unhelpful shop when we're dealing with one of the most emotional things any of us will ever go through. Just another sort of thing that would make me cry right now (see above ). And don't let those anti-nauseals wear off! Hope you're feeling good today, too. suz3: Thanks! Yes, I got good news today. While they did find the extra area of DCIS, the 2.5 mm margin is satisfying everyone, so NO MORE surgery for me (at least not now, anyhow!). GO DUCKS! UTMom2014: Oh yeah, work is definitely the best medicine! Nothing like getting back into the work groove to take my mind off of the BC. Hope this post finds you feeling good after the tx. MaryMeg: Loved your reference to the Stones -- made me laugh!  Glad the tx went smoothly for you -- may they all be like that! slcst12: I think the pinata idea sounds great -- could make what would otherwise be potentially scary for the kids something fun. I love what your friend had to say about us choosing to take control of this whole situation. It's so true. We could decide not to do this, but I'm sure that each of us feels that this is giving us our best chance at NEVER having to face it again. ProudMom_Wife: Hope you are feeling better this evening. My onco nurse yest. during the chemo teach said to stay on top of the nausea and keep taking those anti-nauseals 'cause it's a lot easier to control it if you don't let it creep up on you. I'm all for taking as much medicine as possible to stay ahead of it so I don't have to play catch up. And I'm really not a medicine taker; but I figure this is a special situation. So glad you haven't had any Neulasta pain! I asked my onco yesterday about the Claritin for pain and he says he sees it working all the time. He said he doesn't know why and, even if it is a placebo effect, so what? If it's working, it's working. Hope you continue pain free. I got my bandanas and Gaila in the mail today.  Love the scarves and the Gaila is really nice -- tried it on and I think it's going to work well.  (But, as always, felt myself choking up . . . )  It was so nice that after this free one, I think I'll probably get another couple for variety.  Still want to contact Franceluxe, too -- those look really pretty, as well. Have a lovely weekend, everyone. May it be relatively SE free for those of you in tx already.",

Once again, as everyone has said, go with what your gut is telling you, because it IS such a personal decision.  Do the thing you think you'll have the fewest regrets with.  And never let anyone tell you whatever decision you make is wrong. Tammy:  I tell myself once I feel better I'm going to make a REAL effort to start exercising again and doing yoga.  I have been vegetarian for nearly 20 years, but my diet still hasn't been that great (see my earlier post about loving sweets and chocolate!) and I'd like to change that.  I haven't put any weight on since starting chemo and, while I'd take 5 to 7 pounds off after each AC, I would put it back on with the starchy foods that didn't nauseate me more on my weeks off, so I've held pretty steady.  That said, I need to lose weight.  Like you, I'm 4'11\", and really should weigh about 20 - 25 pounds less than I do -- the extra fat in my body isn't going to help the ER+ status of my BC.  I'm just so tired (and frequently in pain from the Taxol) right now that I'm happy to be able to walk at all around the house and to eat anything that doesn't take too much preparation.  Four more weeks, though, and I should be past the worst of the SEs from my last tx, and I'm planning to start taking better care of myself then. ",

I took my Emend this morning and they gave me Decadron and Aloxi in the infusion to counteract the nausea and, while my tummy feels a little tentative, no problems yet. I took a claritin when I got home in preparation for tomorrow's Neulasta shot. No Benadryl with this, so wasn't sleepy, but I do have a prescription for a sleeping pill for tonight, in case the steroids keep me up. This was the first time they'd accessed my port and it worked like a charm. I'd slathered the Emla cream on it an hour before and by the time she poked me, it barely felt like a pinch -- gotta love that lidocaine!  All in all, the infusion took about 2 hours: 1/2 hour for the pre-meds; 1/2 hour for the Adriamycin (they infuse it here, not a push), and 1 hour for the Cytoxan. I came home and ate and then brushed my teeth and rinsed my mouth out with that nasty baking soda/salt rinse they gave me a recipe for. Hope it works, 'cause I'd hate to be putting that stuff in my mouth every time I eat for nothing. I'm susceptible to mouth sores anyhow, so I want to do everything I can to avoid them. I had thrush once, and that was miserable with a capital M -- also something to avoid if at all possible. Oh, another thing: when they did the saline and heparin flush in my port, I got a funny taste in my mouth (actually, just the right side) and smell in my nose, kind of like a cross between vinegar and lemons . . . Not bad, just strange. Also, I'm trying to get at least 2 liters of water a day and I had to pee 5 times while at the cancer center (once it was pink from the Adriamycin). Hope that's not TMI, but just in case some of you are wondering, with the liquids they're filling us with plus trying to stay hydrated don't be surprised! Oh, I'm about three hours out now, and am really noticing that my mouth and throat are dryer than normal. Anyone else experience it that quickly? UTMom: So sorry about the WBC -- makes me happy my doc has just sched the shot without waiting. He may have done that since I'm at a school all day (when I'm actually at work). Did you feel bad and go to the doc's to find out what was up, or did they just find it at a regular office visit? Hope it picks up for you soon. Definitely keep us posted! JeanH: I sympathize with your not being a morning person! :-) No laughing about the turtle here -- they're just as much a loved pet as a cuddly dog or cat. My assistant at school has three turtles and it sounds as if they have as much personality as any other pet. I just don't think I could give myself a shot; I'm pretty squeamish that way. Interesting about them not grading the ILC. I wonder why? MaryMeg: Love the new picture! Moe0279: You sound like you're doing great! And good for you for doing what YOU'RE most comfortable with. My only problem with the scarves is that I'm going to have to iron the cotton ones, and I really don't like to iron (it's part of my housework phobia, I think). I'd love to hear how things go at school with the scarf; I'll be facing that in a couple of weeks! Tundra: Welcome back! Do I read this right, you've moved? In the middle of all of this? Must have been stressful! Thanks for the info about the solvent, that's definitely interesting to know. Great news about the BC responding to the tx -- once again, it's good to know that we're going through this and getting positive results! Never too much detail -- thanks for posting. ck_moma: Doesn't seem fair that the wig would look better on the model head, does it? I hear they can really shape it up, though. Good luck! It's pretty amazing the amount of meds we're all taking, isn't it. I look at my bathroom counter and wonder how I'll ever keep it straight.

UTMom:  Glad the prune juice worked.  Was it terrible to drink?  Thanks for the \"twist\" tip, too.  I used to love to do that when I was a kid (as a child of the 70s I loved to watch \"Happy Days\") and it looks like it would be great exercise in the comfort of my living room.  I got the Neulasta shot in my arm, but (embarrassingly) in the fat on the back of my arm and the girl gave it slooowwwlly.  It only burned very slightly at one point, but I can see if they gave it fast where it would hurt like the dickens.  I've heard of a number of folks who've gotten the shot in the stomach, too. Moe:  Would Aloe Vera gel help the itching?  Are you conditioning your scalp with conditioner like you would if you had a full head of hair?  I've wondered how to care for my scalp once the hair is gone and wondered if I should treat it like I would normally -- good shampoo and conditioner.  Just didn't know if that would do any good. AmyK:  I've heard that the ginger can really make a difference.  I've tried the tea, too, but not during the tx itself.  I've also found some ginger \"candy\" at my health food store and that also did a nice job of settling my stomach when I was out riding in the car with my husband.  You're right, though, it is really \"peppery.\"  Don't know that I could have more than one piece in quick succession. Good luck to anyone who might be starting tx tomorrow.  I don't have anyone on my list, specifically, but for anyone lurking or who wasn't sure when they would start originally, hope everything goes well for you!",

I got the radiology report on my ultrasound and there doesn't seem to be a clot, so that was good news.  Still don't know why my arm is hurting, but it seems to be getting a little less painful so my onc said we'd just watch it for the time being and see if it continues to get better.   Thanks for all your well-wishes.  It was nice for something to come out good for a change. ",

In the meantime, I and my DH keep plugging along, spending too much time at the oncologist's office, going to appointments.  Don't know what they'd do if we weren't spending our money there.    The nurses at the radiation oncology center looked at me and said, \"I know you,\" and I said \"yes, you do.\"  Thankfully, DH's radiation will only be 14 treatments and at a level about half the intensity I received.  Hopefully that will knock it out.  The joy of lymphoma is that it will almost always, inevitably, come back.

In the end, I think each of us needs to decide what will make us, personally, the most comfortable.  I think I'd have had a harder time with the surgery, and really admire the strength it must take to deal with that.   I am trying to figure out how to tell the kids what I'm going through.  When I was out for my lumpectomy the first time, they were very curious about where I'd been, and I just said I'd had to have surgery.  Now I'm going to be out next week after my re-excision, and there's no way I'm going to be able to hide the hair loss and the other effects the tx are going to have, so I need to find a way to answer their questions that isn't too complicated or scary (although I'm amazed sometimes what young teens can handle).  I know that's a few weeks in the future, but I'm the kind who likes to plan ahead.  My surgery and port placement is tomorrow.  I really don't like surgery . . .",

Too, my assistant is just getting over a raging flu and is not very careful about where she breathes and how she coughs (we both work at the circulation computer) and the last thing I want going into this is to come down with something, even though I've had the flu vaccine. Can we be too careful about sickness? I've got a list of questions for my onco when I see him tomorrow: do I need bone scans/heart function tests? Will I be getting Emend (I know it's expensive, but it sounds like a wonder drug for nausea)? What about Claritin/Glutamine? Thanks to everyone for sharing your experiences -- it's really helping me to know what to ask. Queenjazz: Hope your tx went well today. Let us know how you're doing. slcst12: Looks like we'll be twins (at least for the first few rounds) on this journey -- unfortunately for both of us! With the FDA's recent ruling, will the Avastin still be available? For your wig, definitely check with your local Am. Cancer Society chapter. Also related to the ACS, tlcdirect.org is another place I've read about. Anyone else have some resources? islandmom: Glad you've found a regimen you're more comfortable with. Sorry it means travelling a little further, but to be comfortable is going to be SO important as you start the journey. I know I'm scared about the Adriamycin, but given the size of my tumor and the extensive ductal component and the HER2 positive status of my BC, I want to go at this with the big guns now so I never have to do it again. Good luck tomorrow! bamamama: Hope your haircut was a succes -- I felt really strange after mine, and the kids at school today were doing a lot of double-takes when they saw me, but I really like it, now. Hope it wasn't bad for you! proudmom: Good for you! I hope when you read this that your side effects continue to be minimal. I am in awe of those of you who are going to give yourselves the neulasta/neupogen shots. There is no way I could do that. Hope the shot is easy for you tomorrow.

I won't sugar coat it -- I had a rough time with the AC.  The first round wasn't too bad; I took four days off from work plus the weekend and went back on Monday and was OK.  Each tx, though, the nausea and fatigue lasted longer.  I was able to go back to work each week on Monday, but just felt worse longer.  The last round of AC really wiped me out -- I just wasn't really able to function for about 5 days and made myself go to work the next week.  Hemorrhoids and constipation were always a problem, colace seemed to help, but a laxative would probably have been a good idea, too.  I would get mouth sores about a week out from the tx and I had dry eyes that were really helped with Gen-Teal eye gel each night.  Finally with the last AC I developed hand/foot syndrome (red palms, swelling, scaly skin in the creases of the palms and fingers, and bad pain and itching), which apparently really needs looking at if it happens early in the txs.  I've also completely lost my taste for food -- nothing sounds good and I really have to force myself to eat and drink anything.  I was hoping this wouldn't be an issue with the Taxol, but it seems to be back with a vengeance today. Anyhow -- I know it's not a pretty picture, and it may not be as tough for you.  I hope not.  Best of luck, and check in when you can.",

Congrats in advance, Tammy!  I am t minus 6 days and counting.  If the pattern holds, I won't feel much like imbibing until about 8 days after that, but you can bet I am looking forward to some margaritas, too.  I'm not a big drinker, but I like some good wine with a special meal and the occasional potent margarita at a local Mexican restaurant.  Have a great time at your party! You know you're a cancer patient when you actually look forward to shaving.  I have hair on my arms and have had to shave my legs maybe three times in the last four months.  Most of my eyelashes and nose hair is gone and my eyebrows are straggly, at best.  Wearing glasses has helped to hide that, I think, although it hasn't been as hard mentally as I thought it would be for me.  I find it odd that my finger and toenails have continued to grow normally while my hair hasn't.  I would have thought they'd be affected, too. I'm envious of all of you who can take Ambien -- I tried it once a couple of years ago and it made me do and see crazy things (hallucinations, sleep walking, etc.).  I take temazepam on my treatment weeks, but it only keeps me asleep about 6 hours, then I wake up and my mind starts racing.  Non-treatment weeks I seem to be able to get back in my old routine, just in time to start all over again.  But there's just one more week of that!",

I'm always getting nicked when I get my pedis and I'm desperately afraid now to get one done in case they cut me again. Just sorry your salmon salad didn't turn out as planned. queenjazz: good to know the dry mouth isn't unusual so quickly. I drank so much yesterday I spent more time in the bathroom yesterday than I normally do in three days combined. My DH thinks I'm way underhydrated normally . . . Good luck with your tx today -- here hoping for continued minimal SEs! slcst12: How are you doing today? Were you able to rest at all yesterday? If the nausea continues, be sure to call the onc's office; there's got to be something more they can do -- I sure hope so, anyway. Take care and do let us know how you're feeling as soon as you're up to it. Tammy: Good to know that a few days out you're doing so well. I'm hoping to be going back to school on day 7, so you're giving me some hope. It is empowering, isn't it, to know that we're finally on our way to kicking this thing. And it's great that you have such a great support system! aimster1123: I'm sure pulling for you to be able to get yourself off the pump soon. It's difficult to say which is worse, isn't it? Diarrhea or constipation . . . Sure would be nice to have some in-between, wouldn't it? Beckie: Good luck with yor port placement today. It may be sore for a few days, but it has gotten much better for me. I finally noticed last night that it wasn't pinching at all as I went to sleep. And best of luck on your first TC on Friday -- I'm sure you can do it (may not always be easy, but maybe you'll be able to sail through). Here's hoping for the absolute best. It sounds like you have your arsenal in hand! Betsey: Did they give you the benedryl with your premeds? That will definitely make you foggy. So glad your SEs were as small as they were. Are your tx every three weeks? I couldn't remember. But, most of all, Happy Birthday! AimeeMac: I actually really like the purple in your hair -- sorry it's coming out, but, hey, you can always redo it when your hair comes back. I know a lot of ladies get tired of the pink we get to see so often for BC, but my hairdresser said she puts a pink streak in her hair for October BC awareness month. Made me hope I'd have enough hair back by then to put some pink in mine. Good luck with yours in the next couple of days. Aimster: I know what you mean about worrying about bald spots. With my hair as short as it is right now, I've been wondering if when it comes out I could have big gaps in the back that I wouldn't see. I'd rather take it all of than have that and look like my cat did when he had ringworm. I start pulling hunks out, and I'm going to shave the whole shebang. Love to see a pic of your new do when/if you're feeling up to it. Jane_UK: Good luck on your tx tomorrow. We're pulling for you!",

UTMom:  My energy is mainly back, but my body is not so much so.  I am finding my joints, especially in my legs and ankles, remain creaky and achy.  I asked my onc about it, and he said there's a good chance it may stay this way.  So now I feel 70, rather than 30 (I'm actually 45), when I try to get around.  I keep telling myself that the alternative would be worse, and I know it's so, but I can't help mourning the loss of my body as I knew it in this process. That's the first time I heard of a doctor wanting to keep the port in \"just in case.\"  I think I'd be a little freaked out if it had been me.  I know I've got to keep mine for a year for the Herceptin, but I'm going to want it out at the end of the school year next year. I, too, have a D cup and have been on my back for rads.  I suspect it has a lot to do with the placement of where the tumor was. My skin has held up very well.  I am not peeling at all and look mostly like I have a bad burn.  Of course, as I understand it, the intensity of the radiation depends on the extent and severity of the cancer at the beginning.  I was lucky to have caught mine before any spread and so my course of rads may be less intense than others who were not so lucky. Also, I have followed my RO's instructions to the letter.  Aquaphor once a day starting about one week in but just enough to rub in lightly -- never heavy.  Then, a week later, twice a day, right after rads and then right before bed, using the same light amount.  My RO said if it hadn't been absorbed in the skin by the time I got up in the morning, I was using too much.  I have only two more boosts (tomorrow and Wed.) and then I'm done.  My energy is much better now than when I was on chemo.  I have had a couple of days when I just had to take a nap, but otherwise have been able to function just fine.  I've also begun to walk in the evenings with my husband and have started gentle exercise classes at the \"Y\" and haven't had any problems. I still have the pain in my arm, but it seems to be a little better.  I actually went to a gentle yoga class this week and thought it felt better after.  Seems a little counterintuitive to me, but nevertheless . . . Hope y'all are having a good day today.  My DH and I are off to the quintessentially American activity this evening -- a baseball game (the local A baseball team) and fireworks afterwards.  The crowds are usually horrible, but we always have a good time.",

Unlike the more common form of breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer does not generally show up as a lump. The disease grows as nests or sheets that clog the lymph system under the skin. Often the symptoms are attributed to other diseases and thus the diagnosis may take a long time to occur. Symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: These changes often occur quickly, over a period of weeks. How Is Inflammatory Breast Cancer Diagnosed? Inflammatory breast cancer is often misdiagnosed as another medical condition. It's important to pursue a breast or skin biopsy if treatments for another breast condition like an infection don't work.",

Because the clear area around the tissue taken in the original surgery, was small (1 mm) I am opting for re-excision to clean out the area around where the tumor was located (to be sure the margins are clear) to be followed by chemo and radiation after that.  My whole medical team agrees that the lumpectomy route is as good a choice for me as mastectomy (mx) would be.  For me, this was the preferable choice because I know they have made so many positive strides in cure rates for BC, and because keeping my breast was important to me.  There is no history of BC (or any cancer other than sun-related melanoma) in my family, so that was another factor. But, I would highly recommend getting a complete pathology picture through lumpectomy/node biopsy first, as you can always go back and get the full mx if that will ease your mind about future worries -- a completely valid reason to do the mx. Also, a couple of sites with good, clear information on BC are: Susan G. Komen site, the DCIS site from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, the information on the path report here at breastcancer.org, as well as the informtion on treatment options and decisions on this site.",

The clear margins are determined when they send the tissue sample out to the pathologist, so, no, they can't tell in the operating room -- I wish they could have, it would have saved me the extra surgery, but re-excision seems to be fairly common (my re-excision is sched. for this Thursday).  That said, because my mass was larger than they were expecting, that may have led to the small clear margins in my case.",
