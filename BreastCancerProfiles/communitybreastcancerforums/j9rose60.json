I had a bit of an issue during administration and they had to stop for half an hour, but then the rest of it seemed to go fine.   Then they gave me procrit because my hemoglobin is at 9 and they tell me if it goes lower I will need a transfusion (yuck!) and the day after I was bak in for the usual neulasta host. So hear I am 3 days out with Taxol, Procrit and Neulast running around in my system and I feel like a semi truck is backing over me, over and over again.  (the pain started yesterday, but wasn't quite so bad)  I've taken claritin and ibuprophen, but my shoulderblades, neck, hips, lower back legs, bottoms of my feet hurt terribley, and frankly pretty much all my bones feel horrible. Any advice besides find some vicodan and have someone hit me over the head and knock me out?  LOL.   Besides the bone thing, I have no nause,and only a bit of tingling in the fingers and toes on and off... so maybe this is better than the major weirdness I got during A/C... but the inside bone pain is getting old very fast.  Does this sound familiar to anyone else.
