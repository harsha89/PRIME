    "Content": "May 11, 2016 09:58AM - edited May 11, 2016 09:59AM by texasminded I had 35 RAD treatments in the summer of 2012. I had very few problems with my skin/burns. The first thing I did was buy a big bottle of Aloe Vera juice at Walmart. It is not expensive. I poured some in a Ziplock bag, added a washrag and put it in the fridge. Every morning I would get it and take it with me. When I got back to the car, I would take out the rag and put it under my breast. It was amazing how hot it would be when I removed it. I did this several times on my way home. (My hubby was driving). When I got home, I removed my shirt and let the air get to it. I also used Aquaphor. It is also not expensive at Walmart, but I got my first sample at Texas Oncology. I had very little skin breakage under my breast. My last week of RAD was a little tougher because those 5 treatments were centered on my incisions and the skin broke more that it did earlier. I had a big jar of Silvadene Cream but it did not help the situation at all. I kept putting the Aloe Vera on it and the Aquaphor. The nurses told me that my skin was way better than most taking the same treatments. If you are experiencing broken skin, it is important to go without a bra and just let air get to it. Then apply the Aloe Vera and Aquaphor religiously and I think you will have a better outcome. I bought a few tops that were loose. I even went to work without a bra until all the spots were healed. I hope this helps someone get through those treatments.",
