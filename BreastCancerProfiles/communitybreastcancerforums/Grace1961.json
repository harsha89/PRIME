No problems or complications with the surgery, and everything seemed fine.  Of course this time, the surgeon took even more tissue, and wide margins. I never had any pain issues with the first surgery (never even took rx pain meds).  And I didn't with this one either, until today.  My wound where the drain came out is still draining at night (I assume only at night because I lay on that side), I don't have discharge during the day. Today, I woke up with more yellowish discharge that spotted my clothes and the sheets (darn it), although not much.  But I am having pain on and off all day, which surprises me.  Is it common to have pain this far out after surgery?
