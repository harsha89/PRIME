This week I'm having a lumpectomy, and the day before that surgery, they're implanting a radioactive seed to show the surgeon the location of the tumor. I don't understand why the titanium marker and the radioactive seed are both needed, and I haven't gotten a clear answer to this question. Of course I'd rather not have a radioactive seed implanted if it's not necessary. Does anyone understand why they're marking the tumor site twice? Log in to post a reply",
