Prolactin is the hormone that triggers your milk glands to produce milk. If you are no longer breastfeeding, or last weaned a long time ago, you should no longer be secreting anything much from your breasts. Although some women can, if they really try, squeeze something out of their nipples, which can be normal. But if it's coming out on its own, they want to make sure that something isn't driving your prolactin levels up like a nursing mom's would be. Some medications, for example, have the side effect of boosting prolactin levels. I think, if memory serves, one of the antidepressants does this, and I think there's a blood pressure drug that does this, too. I think also there are medical conditions that can cause abnormal prolactin levels. So don't freak out. Just have the blood test. It's probably nothing. Good luck:) ShelbyÂ ",
