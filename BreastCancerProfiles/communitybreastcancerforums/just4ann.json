I just finished my antibiotics on Tuesday and have an appointment with my LE therapist tomorrow.  I will have to go back through the compression wrapping again just to get my arm to the point I can wear my sleeve and gauntlet.  All because of a little prick in the hand.   So please learn from my mistake and don't take all of the precautions too lightly.   -- Ann ",

I told her to please not do that again.  She said, \"Don't worry, I won't.  It doesn't work.\"        ",
