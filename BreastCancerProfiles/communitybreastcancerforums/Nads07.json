      "Content": "Nads07 wrote: I posted a couple weeks back about some problems that I was experiencing with my left breast(I am soon to be 33 yrs old). I found a couple of \"new\" lumps since then - one where I have been having a burning pain for quite some time now. Had the diagnostic done yesterday - which let to more views + an ultrasound. Dr. came in to take over on the US - said that she was actually more concerned about my RT breast - thickening on the outside + very dense breasts. No physical done to find the lumps. I am really greatful to be able to say that both the mammogram and US was negative, BUT I can still FEEL the lumps clearly. MD said for me to follow up again with mammo when I'm 35. Wouldn't a MRI be more spesific for dense breasts? Sorry for rambling on... I just want to let every one know that I admire each one of you for the courage that you've shown and for all the support you give to one another. It is inspiring to tell my mom some of the stories posted here (she was dx 2/07 with IDC.) God bless! Log in to post a reply",
