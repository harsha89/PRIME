My daughters (26 and 23) are pushing for me to get a mastectomy, and my husband is suggesting that it may be a better idea than a lumpectomy. I already had a lumpectomy (same breast) 9years ago (final diagnoses was LCIS/ADH), and they are thinking that I should just get a mastectomy and be done with this breast, especially since I have had over 15 needle biopsies on this breast over the last 10 years. I am on the fence. I just found out I havecancer on Tuesday, and I feel overwhelmed. Do any of you know if I can have a lumpectomy now and then decide later to have a mastectomy?",

I have a copy of my CT and it states: Increased size of the left upper subpleural nodule, which also appears more irregular than before. Short-term radiological follow-up recommended. I have an appointment tomorrow for a PET scan, so that should show more. From what I understand, lung nodules can grow very quickly, so perhaps this started growing once I finished chemo the beginning of July? I don't know. I know that I just want answers as quickly as possible. Barbe, can't you ask your onc for a follow up CT or PET before that?",

I had the follow up this month (after my treatments were over: AC+T and rads). The new CT scan shows that the nodule grew 2 mm. My oncologist is now sending me for a PET scan, and he has sent me for a referral to a respirologist (lung specialist). From there I will see a surgeon since a biopsy will probably be necessary. I am freaking out. He said it could be bc lung mets, or lung cancer, or maybe nothing. Can anyone who has lung mets help me? How were your lungs mets found?
