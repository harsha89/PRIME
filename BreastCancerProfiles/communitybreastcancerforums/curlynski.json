      "Content": "Mar 18, 2014 05:50PM - edited Mar 18, 2014 06:07PM by curlynski thank you  both...  sheila, i read the link you posted.  yeah, it says in the report that the right breast has a BiRads of 0 because it needs additional imaging.  but what exactly is a \"4 mm asymmetry\"?  (it was also only seen in the CC view).  i've looked online and i'm getting conflicting information.  what would prevent them from originally getting good clear images?  i got this done at a hospital breast center and they do use 'digital' mammography there.  my previous (and first) mammogram 15 months ago went fine with no 'call back' and i was given a BiRads of 2 for both breasts.  **could having lost 50 lbs since my last and first mammogram make a difference in the way my breasts image?  i have lost weight evenly through my body, including my breasts.  i don't have huge breasts.  my bra size is about a 36 C. (i would say a small C cup size).  i was a 40 C a year ago... also, thank you MsPharoah...  yeah, it's been a hard few years watching my mom pass from metatastic breast cancer.  that has to be part of the reason i am so terrified and feel so confused.  i was so nervous waiting for the results of my first mammogram and this time i wasn't nearly as nervous and i get the \"come back for more imaging\".   i just seen your response, geeky...and thank you.  it's so hard not have my mom to talk about this with, she was my best friend, and i'm an only child so no sisters or sisters in law's.  my close friends are around my age and haven't even gotten their first mammograms yet or have family history's of BC.  i feel so alone right now...:-(  also, this friday morning at 10:00 i have to consult with a rheumatologist because i've developed Raynaud's in my fingers and toes.  preliminary blood work by my primary doctor was negative for autoimmune but she wants me to follow up with a rheumatologist to find out if my raynaud's is primary (no known cause and not from an underlying disease) or secondary (caused by autoimmine diosorder such as lupus or scleroderma).  i've always had cold hands and feet but this year it's gotten worse, i've developed the color changes when my hands/body get cold.  they sometimes turn a light blue/purple or the tip of a finger will turn white.  again, i'm wondering if i've always had it but never really noticed it (or showed many symptoms) because i was overweight and or obese and had more body fat.  i am much colder now that i am at a normal weight.  so...this friday morning rheumatologist consultation and friday afternoon breast reimaging and possible ultrasound if the mammogram still appears abnormal.  i am a nervous wreck...  i have a long history of anxiety, especially worrying about medical things, especailly test results!!",

Left Breast:  no suspicious masses, calcifications or areas of architectural distortion are identified.  benign appearing calcifications are seen.   ASSESSMENT:  BiRads 0 - incomplete:  need additonal imaging evaluation of the right breast.  BiRads 2 - benign finding in the left breast. Recommendation:  special view mammogram of the right breast.  spot compression CC 3D tomo and LM 3D tomo.  ultrasound if findings persist.  Routine screening mammogram of the left breast in one year.  as an adjunct to mammography, annual MRI can be considered given patient's elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer (20.5%). **  so what exactly am i dealing with here?  should i be concerned?  the breast nurse said something to the affect that it means the right breast looks different then the left and that it is good that it was seen on only one of the two compressions.  she said they often flatten out during the spot compression but if not then i woiuld need an ultrasound.  ugh...is this a common finding at my age?  i am having lots of anxiety about this and they can't get me in for the follow-up until this friday afternoon, 3 days from now!  i also told them at the time of the mammogram that i have lost 50 lbs this past year (due to diet and exercise).  i am now a normal weight (5'6\" tall and 145 lbs).   Log in to post a reply",
