My general practitioner felt my node and said that it felt completely normal.  I had my blood tested anyway.  I am scared of the results. My mammo and u/s of just the node appeared normal.  The radiologist said that he would have seen something.  He said all the nodes that were looked at were small and appeared normal. Here's the thing: the u/s was just of the node.  The u/s tech just gingerly touched the area where the node was.  She barely moved the u/s wand.  So, I feel that the u/s was incomplete.  She should have u/s my entire armpit including the breast where the pain was. I have an appt with my breast surgeon on Tomorrow.   I am very scared that I have this pain under my armpit.  It is very, very painful.",

I have three microcalcifications and I read that one should get a biopsy if 4 or more are present. Also, I have three microcalcifications scattered randomly all over my breast, so that is why the radiologist isn't that concerned - but I am. Log in to post a reply",

Was the pain in your armpit the reason you went to the doctor? Was the invastive lobular carcinoma detected by calcifications? Thanks again.",

Sometimes, when I wake up, it doesn't hurt at all, but then gets progressively more painful throughout the day.   I felt around my armpit and I think I found a swollen lymph node.  It is movable and it feels like it is a rubber band with a slight swollenness in the middle of it.  The other armpit has a similar lymph node, but it is not as pronounced.   I made an appointment to have a mammo and an u/s next week.  Nothing feels particularly suspicious in that breast, and I thoroughly felt the breast. Should I be worried?  Anyone else experience what I have? Log in to post a reply",

I know that high risk women have to weigh the pros and cons to all the mammos and biopsies. I am having two stereo biopsies that my breast surgeon and radiologist didn't recommend.  My doctors recommended that I wait 6 months for another mammo to watch some new microcalcs that they think are actually old calcs. Am I being hasty?  Only the biopsy result can tell...  Am I raising my risk of BC due to being hasty?   No one knows the answer to that question. Log in to post a reply",
