Anyway for reasons I list, I think I have made up my mind that the surgeon I am seeing tomorrow will be the one I choose- I feel very blessed that my sis in law works in the surgery center where my surgery will be done- I gave her the names of the two surgeons I was referred to. She checked with the surgical nurses and was told hands down the surgeon I see tomorrow is the best,two of the nurses have had breast cancer and he was their surgeon. Of all three I scheduled appointments with his office was the only one who requested my breast records be faxed to them, so he could familiarize hmself with my history before the appointment, which is comforting to me- I also like the fact that if you call his office and need to speak to him directly you are given his contact number-it makes me feel that if an emergency situation arises, his door is open to me- that makes me feel safe...the fact that the surgical nurses applaud him pretty much made my decsion for me. I will see him tomorrow so keeping my fingers crossed... If you think I am off my rocker for the choices I am making please holler at me-- it seems I get more confused with each day- the one thing the surgeon said to us is ITS CURABLE.. those are MAGIC  words... I just have this very dense fog bank living where my brains once did, so it feels anyway, makes it hard to see to what is really there ya know.... Thank you all for everything you do in here... You are all amazing women- God bless each of you..",

I won't know what we are dealing with until I get in there-- My final path appointment was last Thursday and had to be rescheduled as the surgeon was detained in surgery,so tomorrow we are scheduled at 2:30. l I could not make any sense of my initial path report except the diagnosis-the rest was greek to me. There is just so much to digest- we have to start somewhere and this is a pretty good place I have discoverfed. I still don't know what all the abbreviations are and quite frankly I get a bit terrified reading many of these posts-but what is they say- Knowledge is power-just make sure if you have to have a sentinel node dye injection procedure seek information here about it before hand. Good luck to you-",

Rainbow Bridge Poem; You may know it-if not, may it bring you and your family some comfort... Rainbow Bridge: Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... Author unknown...",

I went to what was touted as a professional wig store- paid $350 for a wig that is CRAP- the head needs to be measured so you can get the right size I discovered after the fact, and while doing some research- the store should well have done this for me if they are so professional. They will not refund or exchange, say they have a no exchange, no refund policy when I called them,-signs are posted in the their shop,they said. I asked if it ever occurred to them to them they they are dealing with people undergoing treatment who are most likely not feeling their best and might not see their little signs that are posted- Perhaps if customer satisfaction is a priority they might think about 'VERBALIZING' this policy to their customer while customer before the sale is finalized! Live and learn..... I purchased another wig online at tlc for $50 -I absolutely love it! and you can exchange it and get a refund if not totally satisfied. The first time I wore it out, I felt normal. I told my husband, \"People are staring at me and thinking one of two things either, 1. That lady has one fine looking hairdo...................... or 2. Who does that old hag think she is fooling with that wig?  LOL, LOL LOL..I chose number 1 (:\" More expensive in this case was not better and at this price I can have a few more (: http://www.tlcdirect.org/Default.aspx    ",

I want to know what to expect so I can be somewhat prepared-but this little voice inside me says, you'll be fine, you don't need to know ahead of time -it will be different for you- I know that little voice is like the biggest liar in my life at the moment-sometimes I feel like little pieces of the puzzle are being kept from me- I know this is nothing more than my own paranoia..

Are these all things you learned after you started your chemo? Fortunately my kids are all grown, just my DH and my little four leggers@home- grown kids have been very good about coming over and seeing that we have meals cooked and laundry is done, so that part of this is not a worry to me right now- I just had another big gulp- My surgeon is going out of the country for a few weeks-I guess by the time you see the oncologist you don't need the surgeon anymore? I worry I will need him and he will be unavailable..",

SE from my first chemo kicked in three days post treatment- had me pretty much down for 3 days with the Mac Truck syndrome- Had my first N injection yesterday due to low WBC-so far no SE from that- have a bit of a sore throat this morning-I am thinking I better call and report that to my oncologist-just to be on the safe side,especially with the long weekend approaching. So far, no hair fall out- I am expecting that around 10 July, if it seems to happen on day 14 following first chemo, but then again I not looking that hard so maybe I won't find it. I saw my surgeon yesterday as well about the 'sloshing boob noise' that accompanies me when I walk- he confirmed it is a seroma, and said he could drain it or whatever the terminolgy is, I opted to let it do its thing and absorb-so long as it is not painful or feverish he agreed that is the best choice.
