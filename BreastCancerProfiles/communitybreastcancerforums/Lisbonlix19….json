I just went through the same anguish, despair, ugly crying... and had my bilateral biopsy done last Tuesday and got my results back this morning. The waiting is definitely the worse and so is reading all the stuff online. Like many said, as hard as it may be, don't read too much online. This forum really helped me when I needed support and I also spoke to many women online going through their own battles (including my sister in law who was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer 10 years ago at age 29). Like Keepthefaith also said, you don't need to be anything, cry, be mad, be afraid, look for support. You do t have to keep it together. It is scary and that's ok. I also drew a lot of strength from the women here, that even if the results did not come back B9, they were all here, living, fighting and not defined by thei BC diagnosis. My results came back B9 today and I am praying you will join the group of 80% that get B9 results. Much love ",
