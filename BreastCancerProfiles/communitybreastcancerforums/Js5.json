I didn't want multiple surgeries. But if I were in your situation, I would prob do the same. We all have to do what is right for us. Also, wanted to let everyone know that genetic testing all came back negative. :) Keep in touch, J",

Two days ago, I had an MRI to check tumor size and also check right breast. Now they want me to have an MRI guided biopsy to check a cloudy area on my right breast. I have genetic testing appointment tomorrow. I feel like my surgeon is pushing for lumpectomy (possibly in both breasts) but I am so anxious about all the testing and waiting, I almost feel like a bilateral mastectomy would be better. There are so many decisions to make and I feel like they need to be made quickly. How do I slow down and process it all?
