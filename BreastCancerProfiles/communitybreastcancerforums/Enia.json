Other than that, I unfortunately have no advice to share.",

I had my first dose of chemo on June 29th. After reading through the June group, I figured this one is probably more in my timeline and thus fits better. I'm doing neoadjuvant chemo. That is the reason why I am not staged yet. I have lymph node involvement, but that was diagnosed by needle biopsy and ultrasound of two nodes. Thus, they don't have the big picture yet. But due to high tumor markers and lympho-vascular invasion I'm probably a stage III of some kind. Since no distant metastasis were found by imaging, I stick to stage III until proven otherwise. As you can see at my signature, I'm getting high-dense 2 weekly AC right now. (It's EC here in Germany, but actually quite the same). Since it took about 4 weeks from diagnosis to first treatment, I wasn't scared about treatment at all. I just wanted it to finally begin. Yet, I was prepared for the worst, and hoped for the best. Laugh at me, but I ordered \"meals on wheels\" for I am living on my own and figured, if I am all sick, I should at least have one decent meal a day. Besides, I've never been much of a cook. As a police officer working shifts, I was in the habit of stuffing fast food in my body for many years... Fortunately, my first chemo on June 29th has been really uneventful so far. I was feeling all well during the infusion, and only developed some diffuse leg/hip pain about 3 hours later. But that on a level which wouldn't even require pain treatment. It wasn't caused by the Neulasta shot because I administered that myself not before the following day. It didn't make anything worse. I still developed the same diffuse leg pain at late afternoon. Same on the third day, and now on the fourth day, everything is well. Thus, there is a big chance that this pain wasn't caused by the chemo at all, but either by the steroids administered before chemo and the following 2 days - or the anti-nausea med \"Akynzeo\" which I received about 1 hour before chemo infusion. When a bit of nausea came up the first day (mild, not serious), I decided to have a little soup without having any appetite. That did the trick. From then on, I took care as to have little snacks over the day, and also having some salt crackers at my bedside for the night. Yes, and as everybody else I force myself to drink....to drink...to drink...only getting to 100 oz with the help of some tea and coffee. I just can't get to it with water alone. I know, every body is different, but I hope that my experiences so far can help some of you to be less scared of side effects. There is a good chance, they're mild. And I also know, it can be all different for me the second time around ;-) ",

I have allergies against lots of berries and stone fruits. Doctors warned, please NOT to experiment right now with it. So, I ended up with bananas and wine grapes which are fruits against I've never shown allergic reactions. Veggies are ok though. So I even ate a salad yesterday which I, admittedly, haven't done often before. Well, not as my \"main meal\" that is. I drink less coffee, but still have about 2 big cups a day. And my doctor told me to keep vaping (stopped smoking 3 yrs. ago) during chemo, for it would be way more stressful for the body to fight withdrawal symptoms of any kind during chemo. I shall let go of it after treatment. Yet, I now bought vaping fluids with minimum and zero nicotine. Well, for everyone to see...I haven't lived exactly a healthy life so far. I think, it might have contributed to my condition, but is most likely only one of many factors.",

When asking for sedation (just asking, if there would be any, not necessarily wanting one), he said that unless I am a serious anxiety case, he doesn't want his patients being even sedated. It would be much easier for him and patient, if he could get reliable patient feedback at any time during operation. Besides, I could drive home by myself right after surgery. Turned out he was right. During putting the little tube in the vein he asked if that was ok. Well, it actually did hurt a bit and I told him it's a bit painful, but still ok. He said that \"ok\" is not good enough. He can try placing the tube in other direction bc in some spots there are many nerves while there aren't in others. That did the trick. Since the whole procedure was a cakewalk compared to everything else, this experience gave me lots of trust in this particular surgeon who, as far as I know, unfortunately won't have a part in my further treatment. NOW having said that - we shouldn't underestimate our doctors. You consider yourself \"anxious/scared\" about port insertion. Thus, chances are that your doctor would give a complete different advise to another patient and thinks in your case it's best to go for general anesthesia. If, in your case, he considers \"fidgety\" a possible occurrence while operating, it is probably wise to take the safe road.",

As a matter of fact, I kind of felt relieved when I finally could easily pull out some hair yesterday on day 16 after first AC-Infusion. I started to fear that I am chemo-resistant. Most of the \"missing\" SE in my case I credit the good accompanying meds for. I get \"Akynzeo\"(anti-nausea, that lasts about 72 hours) and Dexamethasone about 1 hour before infusions. Then lots of NACL with the infusions; a bladder protection 2 and 4 hours after infusions at home, Dexamethasone pills on the 2 following days, and Neulasta the day after. We don't have that automatic Neulasta shots here, so I have to inject it myself which is always quite exciting since I suffer from essential tremors in my hands. It's not that bad in general, but affects fine motor skills and especially movements towards targeted spots. Yeah, that is pretty much the exact way one applies shots...LOL. Anyhow, I think those meds work extremely well for me - so I feel blessed so far. For you, the Neulasta seems to work extremely well. 28k is A LOT! I've been tested at 11.8k yesterday and kept the record in our small group. So yours is really MEGA. Odd thing: Of course I never heard of Neulasta before my diagnosis. NOW I see Neulasta commercials all the time on MSNBC. I watch a lot of CNN and MSNBC here in Germany. You guys live in such exciting, well... bizarre, well... odd, well... maniac times right now. As for your question concerning eating. Yes, I eat small amounts over the day. Lots of salt crackers of different brands, soups (the ones you only have to pour boiling water on top) which help to get enough fluid into the body without having to actually DRINK all the time, and a banana, wine grapes or carrots in between. I think I mentioned it before, I have meals on wheels delivered 3 times a week. Initially only ordered while planning for the worst, I keep it up now. It's just sooo convenient and not expensive at all. I am variable on two days, but order always for chemo-day. I get home from Cancer-Center at about 2pm, after 6.5 hours. And it's awesome to find a hot, balanced meal awaiting you that you can eat right away whenever you start feeling hungry. But you have a caring hubby cooking for you which still is the way better option.",

Bring some crackers and a book or Smart Phone/tablet to keep yourself busy. In my center there are no separate rooms. Thus, there's always someone to chat with. But that's different in the US as I could read around here. I assume, they provide water. If not, bring that too. You might want to add your treatment plan to your signature, so that we can see which regimen you're getting at this point. If it's taxol, I know, folks here know quite a few of cooling tricks. Personally, I get all the meds at the chemo center 1 hour ahead of infusion. If they haven't provided prescriptions in advance, you don't have to think of any meds to take at home before chemo. Since I'm living alone, I also take a mini-set (toothbrush, underwear, etc.) with me in case I get an immediate bad reaction and have to stay a day or two. Hopefor - best wishes for you from Germany. I'll be having my second round tomorrow. BUT here \"tomorrow\" is already \"today\". We are 6-9 hours ahead of you guys. I hardly experienced any SE after the first round. AND NEITHER WILL YOU! sunnyjay - I get 3 different meds (steroid, bladder protection, Neulasta shot) to take the 2 days after infusion. The pre-meds are given at the cancer center 1 hour before infusion. But I am on a different regimen. Jenruns - you must be done by now. I hope everything went smoothly and you're doing well.",

JenRuns - Be prepared, but don't expect those side effects from Neulasta. I didn't have them so far after two treatments. Claritin is not a thing here in Germany. Actually, possible SEs were mentioned by the onc but no meds against them. I was having another uneventful infusion of AC (EC) yesterday. But this time I developed a headache later that day. I'm not sure, if didn't drink enough or just the new patient next to me, who was talking to me about CANCER for 5 hours straight w/o any interruptions, was responsible. She wasn't talking out of fear, but since it's her second diagnosis after 9 years, she considers herself an expert now, and just can't stop telling people what to do and how to handle their disease. Other patients had warned me before, but I didn't expect her to be THAT obnoxious. BTW, would be great, if those who haven't, put their treatment in the signature. Otherwise it's really difficult to comment on it. ",
