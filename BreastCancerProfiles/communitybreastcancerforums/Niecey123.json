I am pretty much also worthless the rest of the day. And I still have at least 4 weeks left and pray that i can get through them. The doctor gave me medicine for nausea but doesn't seem to me working. Apparently what I'm going through should not be so pronounced that he said something about doing an MRI which I'm not to happy about since I freak out when I get in to the machine. But better safe than sorry. All this started with radiation so he best not say it didn't cause it is gonna be war! ðŸ˜† I am bailing out Friday and Monday for treatment cause planned family reunion trip; but they will just tack on two days. Lucky me.",
