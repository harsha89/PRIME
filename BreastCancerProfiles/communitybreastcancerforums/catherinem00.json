It's hard, painless and it moves when I wiggle it and push it around. Has anyone had this before? What is the likelihood of this being cancer? I'm 21 years old and have no family history of cancer. Also, I did a self-breast exam and I don't feel anything irregular about my breasts. Log in to post a reply",
