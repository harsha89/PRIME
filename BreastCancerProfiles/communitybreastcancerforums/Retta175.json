Just like you will! I try and tell myself its just a year...I can do anything for a year. I want to see my granddaughters grown. Life will get back to normal and we will be stronger women for it!!  Peace to all this rainy Sunday.",

I'm going in the morning to renew my drivers license...praying my hair stays put tonight and I will buzz it tomorrow. #1 bought me to my knees, I'm hoping #2 will be better!  I'm so proud of all of you, I really don't know how y'all work and mother and do a million things!! All I have done is lay around and complain!",
