Day three of rad treatment I totally bombed. I said to myself: hey, this is supposed to happen in week 3 not day 3!....came home and felt like a zombie. I thought, OK so by treatment 3 this is what I will be like....so fortunately for me, I just retired (days before my dx!) I called on family for help. I'm 63, good health other than small BC but could NOT deal with the deadly fatigue. I do not know how ppl still work (employed outside of home) through the rads...I'm totally sympathetic that for some there is no choice; I have major blessings in that dept., again because I just retired (and it was planned). However, had this come a year or two earlier, I would have to continue to work, no doubt. I hope this helps you: I found that there are just good days and bad days with rads. I don't get it. When I'm having a good day of energy, both mental and a little physical I take advantage of it. However, sometimes right after a treatment I feel, wasted; I give in, go home and stare into space or journal. I'm also blessed with a 1 hour r/t drive too, including treatment, unlike so many others I meet that travel from counties away...Blessings and strength to all of you/us that are journeying this thankfully together.

A very lucky person I am....no node involvement and when I asked my RO on 2nd to last weekly appointment, would I be getting boosters...he reviewed my virtual chart and said: \"Not necessary in my case - very small cancer; lumpectomy produced good clear margins, E receptor positive (IOW no chemo), very treatable. And ended by saying, unless you are very motivated to undergo 4 boosters, I see no reason to advise you to proceed with this, but I would support you if you wanted to\" ugh--\"ball in my court again\". And then we talked stats: benefits of further rad damage vs. QOL....etc; it didn't take me long to blurt out that no I was not motivated to go the booster route. Back to your case however, I'm surprised that you are being given the same amount of rads -16 weeks considering your T size. But--hey, what do I know? Please keep us informed of your progress...and best of luck to you in these early treatment days...they can be so challenging...and yes..we are all virtually holding your hand, more than you know! Love and blessings  ",
