I went for my phuysical and my doctor could not find any abnomalities with my breast. A month later, I woke uop with a sharp pain on my breast with a burning sensation on my nipple. I went for a mamogram and it was said not to be malignant but was ordered to have an ultra sound. At the ultraosund I was told I needed to have another mamogram and I got a call from the doctor that it could be IDC with all posibilities to be it. My questions, I have read a lot now and all says cancer does not cause pain, this pain goes through my sholder and sometimes i feel it if I carry my handbag on my shoulder. Could the mamogram and ulta sould have missed and may be it is a cyst? Â And if infact it is cancer, does the pain am having mean its spread to my lymph? What are the survival rate for IDC? I have a scheduled biopsy in t weeks and I can't bearly close my eyes any more to sleep Log in to post a reply",
