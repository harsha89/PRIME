I'm BRCA1+, like my 2 sisters.  They found a lesion/irregular nodule from a mammo & MRI a week ago, told me I was going for a biopsy and u/s, then told me the day before it was u/s for sure. Had the u/s, they said they had issues locating the precise location of the lesion, so did not do a biopsy, now they are sending me for an MRI-guided biopsy, but told me that they may not even do a biopsy.  I find that odd given our family history. The advice I've rec'd from others is definitely to get another opinion if need be, and to push, push, push them to do something.  Hope all turns out well for you. ",
