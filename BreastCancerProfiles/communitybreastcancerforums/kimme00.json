I then had the spot comp/ultrasound and received the following results: \"FINDINGS: Radial and anti-radial ultrasound images were obtained over the left breast with attention to the 2 o'clock region.  Located 5 cm from the nipple, there is a 3.1 x 3.1 x 1.3cm heterogeneously predominately hyperechoic mass with ill-defined margins with minimal posterior acoustic attenuation.  In correlation with the diagnostic mammogram on 10/26/11, there is question of a 3.3 cm fatty density mass on the MLO spot compression view.  This appears to be fairly marginated by some soft tissue density of the breast parenchyma around it.  I am not, however, able to see it on the other projections.  Overall, I would favor that this mass seen on ultrasound is most likely a benign hamartoma. IMPRESSION: Hyperechoic heterogeneous left 2 o'clock breast mass which, in correlation with recent mammogram, probably has significant fat within it favoring that this represents a hamartoma.  I would recommend ultrasound followup of this mass as well as a left mammogram followup in six months\"  (Birads 3). I had to pickup my results from Radiology myself, so there was no one to explain the results to me.  I don't even think that the radiologist knew of my history, such as a grandmother who had BC, and I was DX with malignant Melanoma 3 months ago and had a wide excisional biopsy on my thigh.  I also learned that I have very dense breasts.  Anyway, I am wondering if I should try and get a biopsy or just wait the six months.  I would try and get it through the CDC/Every Woman Counts Cancer Detection Program if possible.  They cover all treatment if cancer is diagnosed.  It is confusing to read because it sounds like there are two masses in my breast and I really don't like the word \"probably\", I was hoping for something more definitive than it being \"most likely\" benign.  I had recently read that women who have had Melanoma have a 20% increase in having breast cancer within a year of melanoma DX, so that concerns me a bit. Any help or insight into what I should do would be much appreciated.  The support that I've read on these boards for one another is truly amazing and heartening and it's nice to know you are all here.  Thank you!

I feel much better about the situation now and I will definitely take your advice and get a second opinion, because I think confirmation of these results would give me much more peace of mind, so I can move on and not worry about it until the recheck in 6 months. And the fact that the percentages are in my favor certainly calms any fears that I may have had. I guess I've read too many stories online about a doctor being wrong about a benign lump, that I start to imagine the worst, which is not good. Thanks again for your kindness and reassurance - it really means a lot :-) Take care!",
