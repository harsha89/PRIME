I had to make a decision between a lumpectomy+radiation(6.5 wks)+tamoxifen(5 yrs) or a unilateral mx.  I just sat on the decision making until my dr had to force me to make a decision sometime in March 2012.  I sat up all day and night researching and after 1 week, made a decision to have an mx done.  It was the toughest decision I had ever made. We are here for you.",
