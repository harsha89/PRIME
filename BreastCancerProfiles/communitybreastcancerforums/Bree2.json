    "Content": "Mar 3, 2017 12:28PM - edited Mar 3, 2017 12:38PM by Bree2 Hello, I am also newly diagnosed IDC. I'm having a lumpectomy on Monday with lymph node biopsy. I'm very nervous and hoping I will only need radiation therapy. I did find out that I am estrogen/progesterone positive which I believe is good. I am also her2 negative. I'm not sure I really understand that so if anyone can explain I appreciate that.I am really hoping I made the right decision to have just a lumpectomy and not a mastectomy. I see other people have struggled with this surgical decision. Very lost and confused.",
