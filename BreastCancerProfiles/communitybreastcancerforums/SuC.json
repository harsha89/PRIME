My second (prophylactic) mastectomy was far easier and I was back to normal pretty well by 4 weeks. The first time I had had a partial mastectomy which did not get clear margins, followed 10 days alter by a full mastectomy. This is maybe why I took so much longer first time. Also the psychology was different for the second one as I hadn' t just been diagnosed with cancer so was I a far better mental space. Make sure she does her exercises - she should get told which ones to do. These are really important for getting full movement back. I found that you could feel the difference day by day. Hope your Mum goes well ",
