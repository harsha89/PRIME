Are they the same thing?  I was reading online where a woman said that she had medullary features with her breast cancer and that that type of breast cancer is suppose to keep the breast cancer cells from spreading.  However she said that her doctor told her that the tumor just has medullary features and that it is not a medullary carcinoma so that really does not mean anything, and that the cancer cells can still spread.  Is this true?
