I just really need to talk to people who can relate because so many friends and family members simply cant no matter how well their intentions are...  Let me explain our story: I will try my best to make this as short as possible. My mother (58) was diagnosed with stage3 her2+  back in mid 2007, it was also in her lymph nodes under the arm,  she went through a year of chemo,  4 surgeries, 12 radiation treatments and then 6 more months of chemo.. Was in so called remission for approx 6 months... Had her check up and scans May 1st 2009 and the cancer is back and it has spread to her chest wall, the Dr has also said it is now stage lV and is aggressive and it is no longer Her2 +.. So here we go with the new treatment plan which is to be Gemzar and Avastin. Here is where bad get's so much more worse - She had her first treatment of Gemzar on Tuesday June 16th, she felt fine.. Friday morning June 19th my mother suffered a massive stroke which destroyed 85%-90% of the left side of her brain, resulting in right sided paralysis among all the other problems associated with the left side brain injury.. The Dr's told us she would be lucky to make it through the night and that even if she did she wouldn't recover or recognize me or understand what I was saying, I knew right away they were wrong from the way she looked at me when they said it... I am an only child and me and my mother are best friends, I do not need her to talk words to know what she is saying or trying to say to me, if that makes sense...I am 40 by the way... Well, here we are a little over a month after the stroke and we are at a rehab center. My mother has came a long way but there have been several issues along the way that have slowed us down with her rehab. Blood transfusions, feeding tube problems, pain..  Anyways, this is what Im struggling with.. Her oncologist has informed me that it could be 6 months or longer before my mom recovers enough from the stroke to resume chemo, it could be atleast that long before she'd even be strong enough to do scans to check how the cancer is doing.. My mom is one of the strongest women I've ever met and her faith is just as strong as she is but I cant tell her this new's, I just tell her that her oncologist said to get well and get back to chemo soon..I've never lied to my mother and I've promised her Id always tell her the truth if it came to something like this but I dont want her to get down or give up on the rehab.. She has came further than the Dr's said she would already.. She is speaking simple words, she has let me know that she knew everything going on and being said around her while she was in ICU when she first had the stroke.. Her mind is still very much the way it was.. She still cant walk yet, but she is standing,  she still cant move her right arm but each day brings something new she couldn't do the day before... Ladies, I am so so very scared that she is being put through all this and by the time she is able to resume chemo it could be too late.. I am not giving up, Im just worried and am wondering if any of you out there have ever went through this or something similar or know anyone who has.. I cant stand the thought of losing her or to watch her fight so hard to overcome one battle to just lose the other.. I hope this all makes sense.. I love my mother with all my heart, I have been with her everyday and night since she had this stroke, I've only gone home to shower and change clothes and come back to the hospital.. I have a 5yr old daughter whom I miss something terrible when I'm here, my husband is doing an awesome job with bringing her here to see me and her ma-maw as much as possible and I do see her when I go home, however, it's not the same right now as you can imagine.. I have told her that I can't leave her mamaw right now because she cant communicate and need's me to help her..  There's been very few days out of my life where I can recall not seeing my mom.. I just cant imagine what she must be going through and my heart is breaking into a million pieces right now...  I do apologize this was so long, I was trying for it not to be, I just needed to vent and to tell her story and hope for the best advice you can give.. I've read a lot of the post's before I wrote.. I know you are very caring and smart women who have been through so much yourselves but still find the time to brighten each other's days... That says a lot about the kind of people you are.. I just hope you know what special people you are in doing that...  Thank you Lisa Log in to post a reply",
