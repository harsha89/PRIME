Feeling a bit weak/tired and like my insides have the jitters. I'm also having trouble focusing my eyes which I think is starting a headache . Had a wonderful nurse, treatment took about 5 hours but she made sure I was comfortable and warm. Appt tomorrow for Nulasta injection and IV hydration.Â  Hope you all have had a great day, I'm going to take a napÂ ",

I have asthma and had a horrible time when I woke up from general anesthesia last time but the twilight anesthesia was great. I'm surprised that Â so far my pain is minimal. I had not really considered my chemo bag yet, but I am definitely bringing earbuds, don't want to be a captive audience to someone telling horror stories. My best friend brought my a hug bag of yarn and some cute patterns for hats, so I plan to spend my time knitting , I have appt with MO the day before chemo so I'm sure She will give me some hints about what to bring. I have not been working as I am finding it very hard to focus and since I'm a nurse good chance I could catch some nasty bug with compromised immune system on chemo. Speedcat: happy to hear they worked you in at dentist. ðŸ˜¬",
