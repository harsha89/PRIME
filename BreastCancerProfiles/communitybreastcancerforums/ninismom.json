      "Content": "ninismom wrote: Today I finally finished 11 months of treatment for Stage IV breast cancer. I started with six months of taxol, zometa, carboplatin and herceptin. I then had a lumpectomy and axilliary node dissection followed by a complete hysterectomy. Today I had my last radiation treatment - 35 sessions in total. It feels so good to be done. I've continued having herceptin every three weeks, and because I'm stage IV they want me to be on it for life. Initially my oncologist said one year, but then another oncologist recommended for life. After I mentioned the second one's opinion, my primary oncologist said maybe we should do it for life. I'd prefer to be done after a year, but feel very confused. I only had one small met to the bone, which on all recent CT scans shows signs of healing. In fact, my radiologist had a very difficult time radiating the bone because he could not see anything - he said my bone looks completely normal. My oncologist, surgeon and radiologist have all treated me as if I were a Stage III patient. When I say \"treated\" I mean their actual treatment plans - not how they treated me on a personal basis. My prognosis now is excellent. The pathology report from my lumpectomy and node dissection came back clear - no cancer cells at all. Bone looks great...I believe I'm going to be one of the few Stage IV's who makes it long term.  So back to my question....I want to be done with herceptin. I worry about long term effects. Are there any others out there who stopped herceptin after a year? I'm still relatively young (36) with an 18 month old baby, and want to be around for at least another 40+ years (my goal is to celebrate 50 years of marriage, which is 38 years away). Any advice would be appreciated!     Gestational Breast Cancer Dx 10/03/2008 age 35 (seven months post-partum), IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/9 nodes, 1 bone met, ER+/PR+, HER2+, BRCA2+ Log in to post a reply",

I guess if I'm truly honest with myself, the bottom line is that having herceptin for life reinforces the fact that I'm going to have to deal with this for life....I desperately want to be able to say, \"I beat cancer\" and never have to live in fear again. On the other hand, I never want to have to go through what I've gone through again. So if taking herceptin will improve the odds of that, then I should be more than willing to just do it. Today being my last day of treatment especially makes me wish that I could put all of this behind me and be done forever. I just don't want to live in fear of what could be down the road. I want to be the one that beats the odds. I want hope.... Thanks again to all of you!",

I'm grateful that I've had three more Thanksgivings since then - and all were celebrated without tears of sorrow - but instead tears of joy, that I've made it this far. I certainly do have days when I feel that this burden is too heavy, and I so wish that I could have a \"return to innocence\"....the innocence of believing that you are going to live a long, healthy life. Sigh....",
