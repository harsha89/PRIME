I remember the first weeks after mastectomy and reconstruction were very difficult.I was well prepared I thought for the ramifications of surgery but I too had sad crying periods  it seemed to be worse at night when I was tired,Gradually you will come to accept this new body of yours and as the reconstructed breast continued to evolve with nipples and tattoos the more I accepted my new breasts. Now this is just my body..my husbands thinks my new breast is fabulous.I am 5 1/2 year survivor and when I look at my body I do not see the scars. I see just my beautiful whole body.This journey does get easier ;Best wishes Mrs b",

The Le therapist says it is highly treatable and  will likely need a different kind of sleeve that goes across the shoulder.She thinks i will likely only need for excercise. Has anyone used these? Most of the time  the LE hasn't been a problem as I wear my sleeve for excrcise and flying and it responds quite nicely to rest.. no obvuious swelling but the arm gets heavy and achy and only this past plane trip did I get sweelling in my back which convinced me that it was LE. She feels with a few sessions with her I should be able to manage well with doing my own massage. i took a friend with me to the consultation and she said I was practically purring while tthe therapist was doing the massage.... As usual thiese thread has been very helpful.Thanks Mrs B",

I always felt that i had sub clinical lymphodema from day 1 but was able to manage it with  intermittent use of sleeve and elevation. Everyone just said I had a frozen shoulder with arthritis  but things definitely changred when i came back from Florida this year,, area above lat flap wwas swollen, trunck was swollen ..had to keep my bra off for a week so it was evident to me that there had been progression. The over the shoulder sleeve was somenting the MLD therapist thought might be helpful but she too isn't convinced I need to use sleeve for more than excecise.She is optimistic that i won't have to get into wrapping and stuff so am I. I usually resposnd to massage therapy  of other parts of my body quickly and in a sustained manner so I am hoping that I will with MLD. Yes my freind did take notes and will come to a session to learn it herself as will my husband. I have been fortunate that I have followed  the LE threads here since diagnosis so am well versed in the prevention of infections,not using my at risk arm  for ivs etc etc All the best Mrs B",
