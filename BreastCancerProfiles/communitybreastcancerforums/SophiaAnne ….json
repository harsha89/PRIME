I just joined today because I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and thought I'd try and find a group of women who have been and/or are going through treatment. I'm about to begin my radiation treatment (no Chemo) and Tamoxifen. For those of you going through Radition or are finished with your treatments, what information do you have now that you wish you had before starting? I know everyone is different, so it's hard to say, but I thought I'd ask to kind of settle my nerves a little.  Thank you all in advance for your help, and congrats to us all for being survivors so that we may honor those who have passed with our continued fight. ",

I have tears in my eyes  I have the best doctors in the world and am getting treated at one of the best hospitals in the world, yet none of my doctors have told me to get v-neck Ts, or how to mix a topical ointment in order to relieve pain. I'm going to be living at the hospital while undergoing treatment which helps. They have these little apartments for folks who live far away (we live 2-3 hours away depending on traffic), so I can just get pushed back to my room, but the information you provided leads me to believe that I won't be riding my motorcycle while undergoing rads. I was just afraid about the possibility of breaking my ribs going over an unavoidable bump, but it seems like it's just not a good idea. I'm about to go on Amazon to find Lindi Pads  I found out I had cancer just two weeks before my Partner and I were to hop on our motorcycles and head to our new home in Ecuador, so it's been really overwhelming because we sold all our things, and got down to basically what could fit in our saddlebags. But, if I could change anything, even getting cancer I wouldn't because it's taught me so much, even though I get crushed under the weight of it from time to time. ",

Yeah, I know it's hard to judge, but I wanted to hear from actual women as opposed to the countless laundry lists of SEs. I'm practically Vegan, I only buy organic, I rarely, if ever, eat processed food and I don't use any harsh chemicals in my home or on my body, and I don't drink. I'm sure those things will come into play, but now I have a better idea of what to expect. My doctors have told me \"everyone is different,\" but I wanted to hear that from different women. My reaction will be my reaction, but now I know I can help it lean more towards a better reaction, possibly. My Partner's mother is an herbalist (in England, where my Partner and his family are from they're like medical doctors), so now she knows what tinctures and ointments to prepare for my skin. Like I said, they don't tell you about Lindi pads and aloe gel, they tell you how they're going to save your life and honestly, I prefer they focus on that. But just as important in the healing process is a sense of community and knowing that you're not the only person on the planet with the same questions, concerns or even the same desire to simply get on with your life.  Thank you so much, and I hope my questions are received by someone who needed them, just as much as your answers have helped me, tremendously ",

      "Content": "Jul 26, 2013 07:29AM - edited Jul 26, 2013 07:59AM by SophiaAnne-Marie  Congrats on finishing up ladies! I thought I heard bells ringing  I start the prep work sometime next week (Ct scan, etc.) and then will be starting 7 weeks of treatment after that. I'm actually looking forward to it, because it's one step closer to being done. I've also found that focusing on the positive helps as well. I find it so encouraging to hear stories of things being scary, what does or doesn't work (my Lindi pad's on it's way ) or bad SEs and how to deal with them because these things can and do happen. But I also love hearing when things go right, like the thread ScienceGal started about getting through rads with their skin in-tact. It's helped me so much! Oh, and ask your doctors if it's OK to take Astragalus. It boosts immune function during and after rads, so this might help ease some of the SEs and help lower the chance of cancer showing up again. ",
