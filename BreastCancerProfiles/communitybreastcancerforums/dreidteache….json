It changed it's spots so Tamoxifen was no help. Came back as triple negative metastatic breast cancer on chest wall, skin and hot spots in lymph below that area. I kind of shut down at that point when doctor was showing the pet scan. I get my port put back in on Tuesday and chemo Thursday on Gemzar and Carboplatin. It's a three week cycle. This is happening fast. I don't even remember what I packed to take to chemo. My doctor has me confused and I hope someone can explain. He said I was stage 3 tast time so I was still stage 3 but now with triple negative metastatic breast cancer. He also said I would always be in treatment. Am I stage 3? or 4? Also treatments would change over time. I don't know what to think as I guess I'm in shock as I had 3 years after TAC, rads, then Tamo. Any clarification would be appreciated.

I will see my therapist Monday after school and until then keep it wrapped. It may be the glove but not sure as I'm new to this.

Odd thing about this is in early December I took my wedding rings in to be sized as they were so loose they would come off. They sized me as a 51/2, but by the time they were ready I was swelling with the lymphedema. Now a 7 would be tight on a good day. Scared I will never be able to wear them again. Does it get better?

When I've tried wrapping it is a mess. Thank goodness my husband is a great wrapper. This is why I was so excited to finally get the sleeve and glove...something I could put on. Well I really have to have help with it too. Am I doing something wrong? Not being able to do this all my self makes me think I am not trying hard enough.  Thanks all for your help. I look forward to the weekend and staying wrapped.",

My treatments are not going well as I was allergic to the Carbo/Gemzar and Halaven showed progression so I am going for a clinical trial. On the 19th CT Scans with biopsies, EKG, and labs on the 22nd. If all goes as planned start the infusion on the 29th. Hoping this does the trick. My thoughts and prayers for good results for all of you waiting.",
