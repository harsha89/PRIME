I was in your position just over a year ago, 32 years old, no family history (we all die of heart trouble, no cancer to be found!), never been sick a day in my life, no reason to suspect that the lump I felt would be anything but benign, and BAM, a Stage II diagnosis. It would suck at any time in your life, but it sucks extra when you're so young. *hugs* If it helps, this really is the very worst part, the not-knowing, the waiting, the not-having-a-plan-yet, but once you have more information and know exactly what you're up against and what the plan is to deal with it, it will get easier. It's never fun, but it's more manageable when you're not totally in the dark, promise. Stick around, you'll find lots of support here, and lots of wisdom. You'll get through this. <3 (And please stay away from Dr. Google!! Nightmare fuel, that.)",

He told me that the reason for the biopsy is that the scans showed some irregularities, and the only way to know for sure what's going on is to biopsy the tissue. He didn't say what kind of irregularities are present or if they're significant or not, just that they were there and suspicious, and I was in no condition to ask more questions beyond that. He didn't give any indications as to whether he thought it was cancer, he just commented that I'm really young for this and said that the chances of it being cancer are probably 5-50%. I'm really hoping for it to be closer to 5% than 50. He asked if I'd noticed any changes since I first found the lump, and I told him how the only changes are during my period, when it plumps up a bit and gets a bit tender (and then it goes back to its previous size after my period). He said that fibroadenomas tend to do that, so it could possibly be that, but he was noncommittal about it, he didn't say that's what it is, just that it could be that. He took three samples, said they were good, and didn't put in a marker (he said there was no need for it). The whole thing took about 10 minutes, didn't hurt a bit aside from the sting from the lidocaine injection, and he was very nice when I cried. He told me that the results would be sent to my GP next week, and to try not to stress too much because there are a number of things it could be besides cancer (and he made another comment about how young I am - he's probably in his 30s also, but I guess he's not used to women my age needing biopsies, and now I'm terrified that he DOES believe that it's cancer and he's surprised by it because of my age). He also told me that if it IS cancer, there are very good treatment options available. I cried again, then. I've been a mess the past couple of days leading up to this, and will likely be a mess while I'm waiting for the other shoe to fall. It's very hard to focus at work, ugh. I'm dreading the results, and more than that, I'm dreading having to call my mom next week and tell her, a month before Christmas, when she's already got enough on her plate and her own health issues to deal with, that I have cancer. That's the worst part of this whole thing, having to tell my mom, all the way on the other side of the country. I'm currently accepting any and all benign thoughts, wishes and vibes.",

My entire existence IS on hold now, I can't bear to make plans knowing that in a week's time, I may have a diagnosis that forces me to cancel everything. I can't make holiday plans, I haven't picked up tickets to my favourite seasonal event because I'm too afraid I won't be able to go, my boss just offered me a contract extension that I hesitate to sign because it's for next year, and I don't know if I'll even be around then, I feel frozen. I'm regretting the tickets that I bought for a hockey game in February, now that I might be too sick to go (and I was so looking forward to it, I lucked into some really great seats for once). I've been frantic to get my Christmas shopping done NOW because after next week, I probably won't be able to do it (or much of anything), and it's my favourite thing to do. I'm in full-on panic mode and it's awful. Even the doctor today, making small talk while he was prepping for the biopsy, asked if I had any fun travel plans coming up (his previous patient had mentioned an exotic trip, he said), and all I could think was, I probably have cancer, how can I plan a vacation?! How can I have any plans for the future right now?? I've jumped to every possible worst conclusion, I'm overanalyzing every word the doctor said today and trying to figure out if he thinks it looks like cancer, and my anxiety is eating me alive even without the test results, I don't know how I'm going to handle an actual cancer diagnosis. *sigh*",

The doctor told me specifically to make an appointment to get them this week between Tuesday and Friday. The clinic will call any time now and tell me the results are in and to come in for a follow-up. I did pretty good last week (after the initial panic) of not thinking about it. It helps that I was also distracted by a kidney stone (never rains but it pours, right??), which is now sorted out. But now, I'm laser-focused on the lump again, and back to near-panic about the impending results. My heart faces every time the phone rings. (The lump swelled up after the biopsy, but once the discomfort subsided and it healed up a bit, the lump went back down, and it's smallish again now, since I'm between periods. It'll plump up again when my period comes at the end of next week, that's how it behaves.) I'm trying to focus on the positives, the numbers that are in my favour - 80% of biopsies are negative for cancer, breast cancer in your 30s isn't terribly common, the doctor said 5-50% of cancer which means 50-95% chance that it isn't - but it's so hard, I keep imagining the worst. :( If anyone has some spare good vibes to send along for a benign diagnosis, I'd be appreciative. All I can think is, Christmas is a month from Saturday, it's my favourite time of the year, of course this would be the time to get a cancer diagnosis, with my awful luck. :(",

(No online portal to access test results, though, guess I'll just have to get them the old-fashioned way.) The imaging tests were just a few days ago, so I expect my GP's clinic to call on Monday or Tuesday to follow up, and hopefully I'll be able to get more information then. I feel like I'm going into this completely blind because they didn't tell me anything after the scans, and that's the hardest part, I have NO idea what I'm dealing with and how bad it might be (or if there's any chance that it's NOT bad), so naturally, I'm expecting the absolute worst. My anxiety may eat me alive. It's just been such a tough year, absolutely everything has been a struggle, so much has gone wrong these past few months, and now I feel like life is kicking me when I'm down. I'm trying to stay distracted and busy, but it's hard, this is playing on my mind so much, it's the last thing I think about before I fall asleep at night and the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning. I keep worrying about the diagnosis, the treatment, how I'd support myself if I couldn't work - I feel like I'm on the verge of losing everything that I've worked so hard for, you know?? Finally getting on my feet in my life, and now this?? If it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. It doesn't help that I don't have a support system here - my family and friends are all across the country, so there's nobody that I can really count on to help me here. I talk to my best friend regularly, she's far away but she's wonderful and supportive (and also recommends Ativan for the anxiety!), and she's aware of what's happening with me right now, but otherwise, I'm dealing with this on my own and it's really tough. I can't even bring myself to tell my mom without an actual diagnosis, she'd be frantic with worry (made worse by the fact that she's 3000 miles away) and I can't do that to her until I know for sure that there's something to worry about. I wish I had time for hobbies, I work close to 60hrs a week (with 2 hours of commuting each day) at a very stressful job, so I rarely have time to do fun things just for me (never mind having no money for hobbies anyway). I guess I'll just have to cozy up with Netflix more often, find a new series to binge, something to keep me from crying my eyes out every other minute.",

(It's easy for me to say this now, more than a year after my own diagnosis, and hindsight is always 20/20, but I was definitely in crisis-mode when I got my diagnosis 15 months ago when I was 32, so I totally get where you're coming from.) I was terrified and panicked when I got the news, too, I was a wreck, and not only that, but after my own lumpectomy, I had to wait longer than usual for the results because of the Christmas holidays, it was awful! The waiting really is the worst part, we've all been there, but it will get better. Remember to be good to yourself now, do what you need to do to get through these tough early days, find things (and people!) that cheer you up and make you happy, don't beat yourself up too much for having a hard time (we all do!), and if you're really struggling and it's seriously affecting your life, don't be afraid to ask your doctor for help (start with your GP, or whoever has prescribed your anxiety meds). Your cancer centre may offer patient counseling, so you can always ask for help there, also, they specialize in just this sort of thing. Oh, and stay away from Dr. Google!! Nothing good comes from random Googling, trust me, it'll just give you nightmare fuel, and so much of the information out there is outdated and inaccurate. Do yourself a favour and stay away from it. And don't be afraid to ask questions on here, we're all here to help. <3 *hugs*",
