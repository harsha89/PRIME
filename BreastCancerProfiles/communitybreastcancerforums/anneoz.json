It has been 10 months since finishing TCH (6 rounds, every 3 weeks, I finished this in late May 2009). I continued heceptin (every 3 weeks) and finished this 6 weeks ago (late January). The worst issue for me is my hair. I feel so discouraged about it. After all this time it is only about 1.5 inches on top and VERY thin (you can see my scalp shining through). My eyebrows fell out about a month after my last TCH treatment and have not returned. My eyelashes are still really short and again very thin. I have read here that others have found that their hair came back very slowly. I would so appreciate hearing from anyone who could tell me what happened to their hair after stopping herceptin? Thank you so much!Â  Diagnosis: DCIS, stage 2b, HER2+",
