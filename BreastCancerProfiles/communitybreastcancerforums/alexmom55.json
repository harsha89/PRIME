My doctor is good but he doesn't show any compassion and like other doctors I've read about on here, his favorite phrase is \"It's not caused by the radiation.\"  He also blames the bad burning on some of my \"less than healthy\" ways. After 2 months with 3 surgeries, almost 4 months of chemo and now this, sometimes I don't think I will ever feel really good again. Thank you for any help. Kelly",

The radiation is so much better than chemo.  It's a very short time period and you don't get uncomfortable until the end and that doesn't last very long.  It's a small price to pay for such huge benefits.  Keep us posted about your treatment!  Kelly",
