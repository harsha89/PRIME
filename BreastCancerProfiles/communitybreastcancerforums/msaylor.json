I thought it was just due to my cycle and waited for a few cycles to pass. It was still there and bigger. So I made an appt with my PCM and he said he could see why I was concerned as it was VERY palpable! So he sent me for an ultra sound a few days later. I get in there and the tech asked if it was palpable and I said very. So he starts scanning and he can't see it! WHAT!! I said do you feel it, he said yes but it was hard to see on ultrasound. So is this good or bad? I am afraid that they are going to call with the results and just say don't worry about it that's it's nothing. But I don't feel right about it, I have a gut feeling that's it's something. Should I ask for a biopsy to be sure to ease my mind? Will they even do it if I ask? Especially since it is so palpable. I also notice that when I raise my arm on that side there is a slight dimple right below my nipple. I am only 28 almost 29 so could this be nothing? Log in to post a reply",

I finally got my ultrasound results back and just as I figured they couldn't even see it on there, so they referred me to a general surgeon and they are going to do a biopsy. I am relieved that I didn't have to fight for the biopsy they recommeded it! I will keep ya'll posted! I go to the surgeon on Wed. for the initial appt! 80% of biopsies are benign! Praying for ya'll too!! God Bless!!",
