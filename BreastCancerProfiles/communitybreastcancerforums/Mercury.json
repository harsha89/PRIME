The scenario where neoadjuvant chemo to shrink tumor prior to surgery has not been included as an option and I've read this is a very positive thing especially if surgery now would not be able to obtain clean margins.  We are obtaining our second opinion from Hopkins, and we do have complete trust in this oncologist, but right now my Dad would be mad if I went and asked the doctor these questions so I'm wondering if any of you have an idea why this my not have been discussed as a scenario? Thanks so much for your assistance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Kind regards, Mercury.  Log in to post a reply",
