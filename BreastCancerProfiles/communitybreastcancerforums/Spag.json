I am 3 months post partum and not breast feeding. My dr sent me for US first, when I asked why she said because being younger they dont want to expose to radiation if not necessary and its not common to have BC so young but it does occur, also breast density...they are able to see more with US. The US found my lump, the mammo came back clean. Every situation is different though...im praying we are ok! Good luck!!  ",
