The first ultrasound showed it was a fibroadenoma and my doctor said I could biopsy or wait 6 months and come back. I chose to wait 6 months, my most recent ultrasound showed it had grown slightly (which she said could be due to my cycle) and now appears to be Vascular. I'm 21 years old, I know a biopsy will provide the results and no one on here can tell me wether or not I have breast cancer - but is blood flow normal for fibroadenomas? If all other signs show it is a fibroadenoma I'm concerned why my doctor wants to biopsy it. Any advice or knowledge is greatly welcome, I'm trying to stay off google. Much love.

About a year ago I found a lump in my right breast, it's very low, far below the nipple, mobile and they now believe it's a mass not a cyst. There's no pain, sometimes tender if I feel it but not generally. My great grandmother had BC, not anyone else in my family. My first ultrasound said it appreared to be a fibroadenoma but if I wasn concerned I could get a biopsy. We decide do to get a second opinion who looked at the scans and said it was a fibroadenoma and to check back in 6 months. So, last week I went into the same doctor (who gave the second opinion) and had a new ultrasound done. She said it appears to be vascular now and has grown a little bit (however she said that could be due to being on my period). She said she wants to do a biopsy to be sure. I'm first off really horrified of the biopsy process but that I can't avoid. Second of all, I know how rare this would be given my age.. but I'm really nervous. Is vascular a large flag for cancer? I'm overall really nervous and unsettled.. I know it may be irrational to be nervous because of the odds but I'm incredibly nervous. The biopsy is in 2 weeks as I'm traveling and the doctor said it was and the doctor said it wasn't an emergency or urgent and it could wait. Thoughts? Comforting advice? Much appreciated thank you ladies Log in to post a reply",
