      "Content": "KristenUGA10 wrote: Hi here's a little background on me. I'm 29 female with no breast cancer in my family. I have extremely dense breast and have always had pain in my breast since puberty. In September of 2015 I started feeling discomfort in my left armpit. I put pressure on my armpit and noticed a small pea size lump. I setup an appointment with my primary care doctor and he referred me to get a ultrasound on my armpit, mammogram and put me on antibiotics for two months. The mammogram couldn't see anything because my breasts are too dense and the ultrasound did not see the lump in my armpit. They then recommended doing a CT scan. The CT scan came back negative. After all of the negative test results I was kind of brushed off. I waited 2 months and started to feel more discomfort and the lump had doubled in size. I went back to my doctor and he sent me to another imaging location to do a full breast exam. I had another ultrasound done on my armpit. Well everything came back negative again. They said don't worry you're only 29 and its rare for it to be anything just do some stretches and that should help with the pain. Plus, breast cancer doesn't hurt so that's a good sign. I went back to my doctor and told him I wanted a biopsy. His response was good luck finding someone to do it because of the location of the lump (near my lymph nodes). He then sent me to a dermatologist to see what they thought. The dermatologist couldn't believe I was sent to his office because it was obviously not dermatology related. The dermatologist recommended I see a general surgeon to get the lump out. My doctor then tried to send me to a plastic surgeon, not general surgeon because no one would take my insurance. I decided to give up for awhile. I was sick of everyone telling me sorry just deal with the pain and I was getting a new job and could get better insurance. Fast forward to July 2016. My new insurance became active and I immediately setup an appointment with a new primary care doctor. Update on the lump/pain has gotten a lot bigger (over 2cm and visible when sitting up) and the pain is really bad. I have some shooting pain in my left breast and sometimes a tingle sensation down mid bicep. My armpit is constantly sore. My new doctor sent me to get an ultrasound guided needle biopsy and when I went in to get the biopsy they refused me because they said they could not see it on the ultrasound and even though they could visibly see it that didn't matter. I called my doctor and told him what happened and asked to see a surgical oncologist. My friend who has breast cancer referred me to this great surgical oncologist. I had my appointment with her yesterday. She did breast exam on me and noticed that when I lay down the lump disappears into my armpit but when I sit-up she can see/feel it. She was shocked that they did not do the ultrasound sitting up because it is obviously there. She told me that she will remove but she is going to preform surgery with me sitting up because of how it disappears. After surgery we will see what it is. Has anyone experience my situation before? I'm afraid I wasted too much time this past year. Has anyone ever had so many test done but nothing show up and it still be cancer? Also, I have within the past two months had constant headaches and wonder if anyone has had headaches related to breast cancer or even pain? Sorry this was so long. Thank you for reading my story and I appreciate any comments or recommendations in advance. Log in to post a reply",

A week after my surgery a seroma formed and has already been drained twice. Now I believe I have Axillary Web Syndrome (cording). I am unable to lift my arm more than shoulder length and cannot fully stretch my arm. When I do I have pain in my wrist and bicep/tricep not allowing me to keep going. Also, it looks like to nerves are sticking out of my armpit. Since the seroma has formed I have had nerve pain and my breast surgeon put me on medication to help this. She said the nerve pain is most likely because of the seroma. I am scheduling an appointment with my BS next week because of the cording. From researching it says cording takes months to go away. Has anyone had this and how long did it take for it to go away? I am hoping not too long because this hurts really bad and I can't really use my arm without it hurting. Thank you for reading my post!
