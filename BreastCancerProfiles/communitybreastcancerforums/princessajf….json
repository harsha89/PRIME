A stool isn't an option. When I'm there I'm moving. We're a high end boutique and my specialty is personalised frame selections and making people look good. I'm thinking I'll last a couple hours at best :)",

Unfortunately I developed an infection on the right side (the side that didn't have cancer) and ended up back in the hospital for 4 days and had the right te removed on September 11. Good news... Cancer is out and only tamoxifen for me. Here's my question. I run a super busy optometry practice. I'm on my feet 9-11 hours a day usually. My boss is amazing and really understanding. They really need me so I said I would try to go in tomorrow, 10/2, but right now I still have pain and can't seem to get myself out of bed before 10 am. I'm exhausted again by 4 in the afternoon. What do I do?",
