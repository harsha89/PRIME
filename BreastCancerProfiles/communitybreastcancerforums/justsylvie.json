As much as none of us want to be in this club, the fact that we aren't alone helps enormously. Having a place to vent, rant, weep, and not always have to be so damn strong for everyone, is exactly what I need, I think. When breast cancer first hit, I set up a blog ( www.breastcancervictory.com ) to tell my story and keep me on track for personal healing. This was huge for me, because I tend to be a very private person on emotional stuff.  Doing the blog publicly helped keep me focused on the positive as much as possible. Once I hit the \"five year all clear\" mark, I was fine with never posting to the blog again, thinking I was all done with it and could move on with my life. Now, I am trying to get up my nerve and energy to post the \"crap, it's back\" blog post I'm dreading.  But in the meantime, getting through the initial rush of doctor's appointments, scans, chemo, etc etc etc is taking up most of my energy. Starting to feel a bit better with my first two chemo treatments. This gives me major hope. If we can get the lung issue under control, my prognosis dramatically increases. (Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis is the official term for how the breast cancer metasticized into my lungs)  I went through months of hell because my \"regular\" doctor kept throwing antibiotics at me for \"double pneumonia\" instead of bothering to check for cancer, so my body has been rather weakened for a while now. I lost a lot of weight way too fast. Now that I am getting treatments, it is getting easier to breathe, and my appetite is improving. I'm feeling stronger every day, and that makes me very happy. So, I'm starting to accept that I am part of this club for the rest of my life. Once I can take that, I can start looking at  longer term plans. I have always been a planner, and right now, I hate not being able to plan my future at all. That's hard for me.  OK, now I'm officially rambling, so I'll stop here for now. :) Thanks again for the hugs and welcomes.",
