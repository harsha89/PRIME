      "Content": "Jenya wrote: I finished neoadjuvant chemotherapy last week. My MRI from this week shows that I have near complete response. My two lumps are gone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy opens a door for me, and now I have two options for surgery. - mastectomy - breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy) : cut off 40% of breast (due to widely-spread calcification) Since calcification is spreading half of my breast, my surgeon suggests mastectomy. However, I try to avoid invasive surgery as much as possible. I am going to meet plastic surgeon next week, and would like to gather some information first. I wonder if anyone have big area lumpectomy with reconstruction? How is the result? Is it hard to reconstruct breast from big area lumpectomy?
