I think I have some lingering effects (strange cough, throat clearing issues) from it but it can't be proven. I would think very carefully about choosing that option not because of concerns with heart/lungs but with the damage it will do to your skin. I had a recurrence and just completed my exchange to permanent implants after BMX with TE. Unfortunately, my rads side is not cooperating as nicely as the other side There is hardness & scar tissue that is preventing the implant from falling into place properly. From what I have heard, I am very fortunate that this is the only problem I have experienced - many others who have had BMX/implants after rads have had numerous other serious problems. I am not trying to scare you but very few doctors ever talk about those potential issues when you are discussing the options. Best wishes in making your decision! Jenn",
