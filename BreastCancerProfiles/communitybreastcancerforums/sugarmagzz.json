I feel like I know you all, thank you for sharing your stories and for being here! Here's mine: I am 34, was dx 2 days after this last Christmas with TNBC, was initially thought to be stage II but since I found the lump in Nov 2011 while breastfeeding my 1 month old son I just knew it was going to turn out to be bad. I was right, after CT scan and port placement on New Years Eve a few days later I was told it had spread to liver, lungs, and lymph nodes and I was stage IV. I had been seeking consultation on the lump for nearly 1 year at that point and they had missed the cancer the entire time. My cancer is very aggressive, grade 3, and obviously with TNBC I don't have to tell you anymore about prognosis. I am BRCA 1+, my son is now 20 months old. I had 4 rounds of A/C which I did not handle well, was very sick and when my MO wanted to do 2 more rounds I sought a second opinion at Dana Farber in Boston. I had initially met with the MO there at dx but had already started tx at the other hospital. She disagreed with continuing AC as scans revealed no real change - stable, but no shrinkage, and with the risk of heart damage she recommended going to 12 weekly taxol instead. Then we found a clinicial trial that I would qualify for, began testing for that and started in April. The study is for a PARP inhibitor called Velaparib and I take it for 7 days along with carboplatin/taxol at each cycle which is every 3 weeks. I handle this much better, although the neuropathy, pain from taxol, and fatigue I do struggle with. I have my first scan on Friday, the MO does not expect to see any shrinking based on the fact that my breast tumor is unchanged in size. I am so afraid to see this as I fear that nothing will work for me. I know I have only begun with tx options and thanks to this thread I can see that many of you have found ones that have worked to buy some years which gives me hope. I don't want to die before my son can have memories of me, that is truly the most devastating part of this for me. I want him to know and feel my love before I go. I started a blog recently, mostly as self-therapy, but also for friends and family to try to understand what I'm going through. The website is stellablue dot net if anyone would like to follow me. I hope to get to know you ladies more and I wish everyone the best. Hoping for miracles for all of us. ~Cheri",

I know that a lot of women do not have success with hormonal treatments and I'm not trying to belittle their condition because obviously stage IV anything is awful, but it can be hard sometimes to see how many more choices they have. I am still going back and reading posts here, but wanted to say hello and join the group. Â @Angela - I am so sorry to hear of this turn of events for you and I hope the radiation is successful and you are back on your feet soon. You'll be in my thoughts.",

Sad to be off the trial but glad my onc is OK with continuing on carbo/taxol for now - I'm not ready to move on to the next one in the arsenal. blondie1- I have muscle fatigue too and was thinking of getting ensure. I hate the stuff but I need all the help I can get. Maybe you can find something online that is similar that doesn't have folate?",

I was on a clinical trial until a few weeks ago when it was discovered I also have brain mets. I was on vacation and enjoying a 5 week chemo break which has extended to 8 weeks due to WBR, I start back next Friday. I know how scary it is to be wondering every second if the mets are growing. I also have the same trouble with my stomach, were you on steroids at all during your radiation? I don't know if they do steroids for bone radiation, but I am pretty sure that my stomach issues are from the steroids since I had a CT scan that showed stability in my liver mets the same week of my brain mets dx. Hoping you can find some peace until you start your new tx.",
