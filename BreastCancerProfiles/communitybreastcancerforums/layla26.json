I finally got the call with my punch biopsy results.... \"benign epithelial fibro polyp\"....They want me to come in for a follow up..... I have the following questions:  1)  Why would they want me to come in if it is beningn  2)  I googled a epithelial fibroid polyp and saw pictures of skin tags -- that is NOT what i have....  3)  Do you think these findings indicate some sort of changes in the skin that can indicate a pre-malignancy? The BS is away at a conference, and my appointment is next Monday, the 16th....Please any help would be GREATLY appreciated!! Log in to post a reply",
