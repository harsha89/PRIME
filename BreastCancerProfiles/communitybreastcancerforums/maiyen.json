I'm supposed to learn more this afternoon when I meet with my doctor to go over my path report. My mom passed away from BC several years ago and the physicians at that time royally screwed things up with her so I'm overly cautious with my own health. Is it wrong to want to see someone other than who my doctor recommends - so far she's given me names for surgeons, but shouldn't I see an oncologist first? Is an NCI designated cancer center overkill since I've been told that my cancer has been caught early (my mom was told the same thing and then diagnosed as terminal a year later). I don't want to seem as if I'm paranoid, but I want to be able to sleep at night knowing that I'm seeing a great team of specialists (and how do you even find this great team?).

My mom was diagnosed at an early stage when she was 55, at 56 she was diagnosed at stage IV and given 6 months to live and then passed 7 months later. It is hard not to think of the experiences that our moms went through as we go embark on our own. I had a pointless afternoon appointment with my OBGYN who told me over the phone that she had details from the path report, which she preferred to provide in person, but she really didn't have as the results are still pending. I kind of felt like she just wanted to bill me for a doctor's visit and take advantage of the appt so she could try to refer me to her husband who is a surgeon. I did mention the possibility of wanting to travel to see a specialist and she said that IDC was so common that it wasn't necessary and if it was her, she would stay in Austin for treatment. So thank you for making me feel like I'm not overreacting.",

When I first started having breast issues, I wanted to try and educate myself on everything that I could and came across areyoudense and other various websites about density and many times I saw the connection between dense breasts and MRIs, but there was nothing about age being a factor, how dense breasts in younger women would not be considered unusual, etc. I have been having annual mammos with US every 6 months, but this last visit showed growth via mammo and virtually no growth via US. My BS said that US is typically more accurate when it comes to measuring, but I don't think she liked the fact that there was a decent amount of discrepancy between the two. And she had brought up the high risk, and with everything else...I think she decided that MRI would be best. When my BS first recommended an MRI, I expressed concern that insurance would not cover it and she explained that because of my dense breasts and high risk factors...it probably would (and should). And then when I contacted my insurance and learned what their specific guidelines are in order for MRI breast screenings to be covered, it all made sense. But in all honesty, if I didn't have my own personal experience with insurance and my BS...I would have probably assumed that I should get an MRI just because I have dense breasts. Jessica749, as far as why I am monitoring the lumps rather than removal...that is actually kind of under debate right now. The facility that I go to right now has explained to me that their surgeons are very conservative and unless there is definite cancer, they will not remove lumps and I'd have to seek an outside surgeon for that. I'm being monitored because my large lump is about 5 cm and they don't feel comfortable letting me go on the basis that the core biopsy had a benign finding and such little tissue was tested vs the majority of the mass which was not. I've heard from others to leave it in, take it out, get a second opinion...it is driving me nuts. And I really don't want to pay for an MRI only to have turn around and get an excisional biopsy because someone decides that it needs to be removed.",

I understand how hormone pos/neg, HER2 and node status necessitates treatment plans for some, but not others. What about tumor size, grade and Ki67? One MO told me chemo would be no benefit; however he feels that there is probably something familial going on because there is a decent amount of cancer history in my family. The other MO said chemo would be very low benefit but if I go with chemo then I'd do TC x 4. I am getting the Mammaprint test done, but not sure if the results will be in by the time that I need to make my decision. Log in to post a reply",

I agree that survival odds for 5, 10 years (although great to get to those milestones without a recurrence) seem somewhat depressing. I'm in my early 40's and also want to live a long life and 10 years doesn't even get me to 55. I did ask a question to John's Hopkins 'ask an expert' and they responded in pretty much the same way that you did. They also said that they like to see Ki-67 less than 15% so that may play a factor in regards to chemo. Since my primary MO doesn't look at Ki67 at all, I find different opinions like this somewhat distressing for patients because it tends to add to our confusion. Thanks for your feedback as a lot of what you are saying seems in line with my thoughts.",

I don't want to seem annoying or impatient, but is this pretty typical for the follow-up?  I've also been reading that after a core needle biopsy, a titanium clip should be inserted and a mammogram should be done to ensure that the correct spot was sampled.  I didn't receive a clip or a mammogram...does this affect anything? Sorry for all the questions, just a little stumped right now.  Thank you all.  Log in to post a reply",
