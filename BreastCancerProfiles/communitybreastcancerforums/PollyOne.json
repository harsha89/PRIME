I love to knit and crochet so am looking forward to putting one together.  You say they're comfortable two weeks out of surgery, but I'm experiencing discomfort with anything touching the edges of my mx. Also riding in a car. Do you have any suggestions for what I could do to minimize that? ",

If I had it to do over, I would have taken way more pain meds in the beginning. I'm eperiencing pretty constant low level oain, and finding it exhausting My oncotyoe result was 15. I'm not sure what that means but the nurse told me it was good and I won't need chemo. After trying to work four hours on Tuesday from home I realized the pain and fatigue mean I'm a ways away from returning to work so am planning to be out through the end of next week. Sending you a big soft air hug. ",
