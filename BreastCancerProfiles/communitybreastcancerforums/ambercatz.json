I had a needle biopsy and then was sent for a mammogram and she found the nodes were swollen so I had 6 needle biopsies taken which was completely painless after the local. Back to doc who basically said Â it looks like cancer (in a much nicer way than that) and I now have to wait a week for results. I was actually amazingly calm as I was pretty sure of the diagnosis myself so it wasn't a shock and I had gone into shock earlier when I went to the GP and she said it looked bad as it was hard and immovable. I had told my children yesterday and that was actually harder than anything else but their support helped me today. The good news is that the other breast looks clear. The lump is 3.4cm and she took biopsis from 3 nodes-didn't think to ask if only 3 were affected-duh! It's just a case of fingers crossed now and keeping positive until next week. The doctor did say they may do chemo first and then the surgery. I hate the thought of chemo as I hate being sick. I thought they would do a lumpectomy first and then chemo-does anyone know why they do it the other way round or have you had treatment like this? What is the norm. As expected I now have lots of questions but will write them all down for next week and meanwhile just hope it hasn't spread elsewhere. Everybody at the hospital were lovely which helped me keep positive. I am glad there's somewhere like this to talk to others who have been or are going through it as it really helps Log in to post a reply",
