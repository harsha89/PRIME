Of course as luck would have it I was also diagnosed as having a primary lung cancer the same time as the mets appeared. The onc told me I was interesting. Told him I would rather be boring. At any rate, they went in with a robot and cut off the top lobe of my lung and he removed 24 lymph nodes from my chest. The great thing is now the lung cancers gone and he put me into remission with the breast cancer. So now each month I march to the onc and get thewonderful injections of faslodex. They have already told me that the faslodex wont work forever, that it will come back again and that I wont be getting chemo again as it didnt work last time evidently. No clue what they will do then. But for now tumor markers last month were 17 so enjoying life while I can. I was on here back in 08-09 but cant remember the name I used or anyone elses so if ive talked to you before and dont remember im sorry. Nice to meet all of you.",

Here lately though I am having alot of pain in my hip joints. It takes all I have somedays to get up and get my legs and hips to cooperate, they hurt so badly. I wonder if the faslodex can affect the joint lubricants? Sorry I know thats not what its called but chemo brain lasts longer then they say. I also stay tired with no energy. And here it is, almost weds, time for the injections again and I still have hard knots from the last ones, despite rubbing them.",
