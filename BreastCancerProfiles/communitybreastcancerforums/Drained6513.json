I am just kinda panic stricken about my hair. Its still not very thick..and the front sides and front top you can see my scalp... it looks so wierd. I have some hair on the crown which is thicker...then it gets sparser getting nearer the top front. I could cry. I am really tired of all of this. Seq..I've been following these posts and I understand your distress and your hairs alot fuller than mine. I know you have 9 more weeks on me. I am so afraid mine is not going to be thick and full... this is worse than all the surgeries I had. I take vitamins...try and drink my vegetable juicing daily...and try to eat right. Did the Nioxin..and Rogaine. Tired of the hats and wigs. Went for my Herceptin treatment last week with nothing on my head. And even had looks from some nurses and the other ppl there. This is soo horrible. Any encouragement or words of wisdom or advice on this? Also, not to mention the huge chipmunk cheeks you get, I'm guessing is from the steroids they give you with the Taxol treatments. Friggin nightmare.",

I've had it coloured at least 4 times and trimmed. It looks like a normal short pixie cut. The thing is it isn't growing very fast. I use to get my hair trimmed or cut every 6 weeks before chemo and it would grown out quickly if I wanted to change my hair style. Can anyone on here tell me is this how fast it is going to grow forever? I only get it trimmed on my hair colouring days.... so it has some style... when or will it start to grow at a normal rate. And why does it do that? I'd like to at least get to the length of a Bob.",

So thank you for all your responses again. I did go through a lot of the posts on here and read the ones regarding this particular surgery. It was also very helpful. Because ovarian cancer doesn't usually become symptomatic until it is at a late stage, I just felt it was the safe way to go. I am posting this, because it may help someone else worried about the same thing. Being post menopausal, I have not experienced any difference without them. There was one unique development though. As my gynecologist was in the surgery, they discovered my appendix was enlarged, which is right by the right ovary. So they removed it too. lol I mean I don't know why I am laughing, except you have to have a sense of humour in all of this and also just glad it was caught. My GP said it was chronic appendicitis, and you can have that with little to no symptoms. It can mimic bladder infections etc.. which I get alot of, so it can be hard to diagnose. Apparently, it can come and go for weeks, months, and even years and is suppose to be rare. Just another shocking moment in my life. lol Has anyone ever had a similar experience?",

I am doing the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner and scalp treatment which I started just before treatment.  I don't know if that helped all that much.  It may have kept the follicles open more.  My hair is long in some areas, but thin. I've seen some women's hair photos on here and they all look great.  I just wonder how they kept their skin looking so supple and nice?  I used a lot of cream at night on my skin and drank a lot of water but I still look like a person that has major sun damage, when I had such young looking skin before.  I am having an IV vitamin c and other vitamins drip tmrw at my local Naturopath.  And going to be doing this for a bit.  I have to do it one week after my Herceptin treatment, once a week, for two weeks, then stop a week before the Herceptin, and keep repeating. I heard this will help my body heal and help with the hair regrowth and skin etc.  ",

And Mustlovepoodles, it is good to know your hair did come back pretty much the same way. It's the waiting game and the wig wearing that is awful. It is really slow growing...as you know. And any length you get right now does not have thickness involved. I can still see my scalp in certain areas and certain lighting. It's embarrassing and frustrating. Oh well. It's also that everyone's hair comes back differently. Will mine come back ok? My guess is it will... but it does stay in the back of your mind. It is such a slow process..that you just can't help but wonder how it is going to come in. Do you mind me asking what shampoos you used? Im using Nioxin and then rogaine twice a day.

I started peri menopause in my late 30's and had alot of hot flashes and other symptoms and it was not pleasant. By the time I did hit menopause I got onto BHRT for about 5 years. And of course, getting BC had to get off of them. The BHRT got me thru the worst of menopause. Since I've been off them I feel fine. No menopausal symtoms anymore. So, it makes sense what the dr says, they arent useful for hormone production anymore. I don't trust doctors, and of course, I want to stay healthy and functional for as long as possible. So hopefully, being in Post Menopause there really is no benefit still from them which could keep me safe guarded from ill health? As in keeping one of them",

This time they sent me for a biopsy and the radiologist that was suppose to do it, said I didn't need it... that the other place didn't roll the film properly or something like that. So he just decided not to do the biopsy. I didn't even know it was for biopsy, I was just told I needed to go see them. I too had no idea there was even a problem. There was no lump. My GP didn't even think maybe to send me to a breast clinic to make sure it was ok. I really had no idea. They send letters back and forth these doctors and don't fill the patient in. I was called to go get a mammogram in 2013 as a follow up, but I didn't know it was for follow up, I thought it was just a routine mammogram. Women's lives are on the line with this sort of negligence. I am now looking for another GP as well. I waited 3 years later to get my next mammogram, because I didn't think there was an urgency. It didn't run in my family either, so I thought I was ok. I don't know how some of these doctors sleep at night. It's disgusting.",
