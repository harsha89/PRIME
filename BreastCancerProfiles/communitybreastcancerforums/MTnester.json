I agree with sewing nut, you'll have a more clear idea of treatment when you get your pathology report. I hated the in between time in my treatment...having the diagnosis but not knowing what was next. Take care of yourself and celebrate like mad when you get the drain out (hated those stnking things!).",

My BRCA was negative but I have an aunt with ovarian cancer, a father with prostate cancer, and a sister with oral cancer. One thing my MO suggested was that I get Zoladex injections fora few months before having the ovaries removed. It shuts them off and simulates menopause. Her thinking was if I couldn't handle the side effects, she would hold off on the oopherectomy. I have to say the side effects are better now than they were on Zoladex. Take care of yourself Teri!",
