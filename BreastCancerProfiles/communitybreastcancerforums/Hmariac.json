I had BRACA test a few years ago with my gyn\u2019s recommendation since I have a family history but it was negative. I have been steering clear of google since I know that could worry me more. I know that lumps are often benign but the worry creeps in. I\u2019m waiting for my referral to go through so I\u2019ll be calling the clinic again Monday to check that they\u2019ve received it. My hubby in military so the referal process might be different. When my doctor does anyone know if it\u2019s normal to be sent for An ultrasound and not a mammogram?",

I went to my gyn for my normal well woman visit and she found the lump when she examined my breast, she told me she would refer me to radiology for a breast ultrasound. She didn't explain to me what she thought about it, she was just stoned faced and said get the ultrasound done. My mother had ovarian cancer, maternal grandmother and aunt had breast cancer, so finding a lump is starting to make me worry a bit. I have two young children and I worry if this lump is something significant will I get sick and they will not have my best self. Is there anyone who has been in this same boat that can offer their experience please? My husband is so terrified of the thought of this he doesn't want to talk about it. Is it notmal for doc to do ultrasound instead of mammogram? Log in to post a reply",
