Luckily I should not need chemo/radiation- still waiting on pathology. I can completely understand that this process feels like it's taking soooo long. I was diagnosed on June 9 after 6 months of having symptoms and the 2 month wait until surgery felt like years. But please use this time to get everything organized that you will need. Stock the freezer, stock the necessities around the house, have a game plan for your return. Make certain that whomever is helping you at home understands your limits. My husband has no household responsibilities on a normal day, but he has learned. My nurses were very clear with him that I will not be able to do my usual chores. I've limited myself to slow dishwashing (we have no dishwasher) and very small loads of laundry picked up one piece at a time. He has picked up everything else. You will also need someone to help with your incision care. My husband cleaned and re-bandaged around the tube and incision- using my arms for that long and trying to do this by myself just makes life harder. Take is easy when you get home. If you've never had surgery before, you will be surprised at how tired you get by the smallest exertion. If doctor tells you six weeks, plan on six weeks. Again, hoping you all have great recoveries!",
