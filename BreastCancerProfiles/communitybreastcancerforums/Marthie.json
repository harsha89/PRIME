I feel a pulling and burning sensation.  It doesn't feel normal at all. I am not sure what it is and my concern is what if it gets bigger.    I wanted to reach out to women like myself who have had this surgery.  Your posting was very informative.  I just don't know what kind of Dr. I should see.  I was wondering if I should see another plastic surgeon or a hernia Dr.  I would appreciate anyone's feed back.  Thank you!!",
