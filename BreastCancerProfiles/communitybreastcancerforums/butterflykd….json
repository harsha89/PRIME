      "Content": "Sep 7, 2015 12:34PM - edited Sep 7, 2015 12:35PM by butterflykdh I'm sure that starting treatment will help. As will having a plan. I don't do well when things aren't clear so this part is really hard for me & my anxiety is out the window. Everyone says to have 2nd opinions but if I'm comfortable with the set of Drs that I've been given is that necessary. They all have excellent reputations &'have been treating breast cancer for a long time. Most even teach at local med schools also so I'm not sure I'd find better qualified people to do a 2nd opinion without going out of state which I can't really afford. I've spoken to nurses that work at other in home infusions which our son gets for an immune disorder. & they have said that if they needed cancer care to hospital I'm using is where they would go cause their 'team' approach is very effective & all the doctors involved in the cancer teams are excellent . And I've compared their recommendations to sites online & they all seem to say the same thing as recommendations so far. So I guess that is sort of 2nd opinions. Or at least research into it all. I'm just trying to get to a place where I feel safe. I keep having panic attacks when I start to fall asleep. I guess I can hold them off when I'm alert but my defenses are down as I start to fall asleep. So sleeping has been difficult also. I'm just a hot mess right now. I want to be strong I hate being weak but I can't seem to get grip for long. Thank all of you who responded. The support means a lot to me!!",

I felt very alone at the beginning of this but every day I find some one else who is supporting me through this. Sisters I didn't know I had. Online & off. I don't know how I'd manage all this without all of you out there! I'm so glad I found you. I know there will be days in the not too distant future where I feel awful but I now know I don't have to do this all alone. Thank you for being there for me.

The dr can quote all the stats & options ybut hearing from people who've gone through is much more helpful. I had pretty small breasts when I was young but after 2 children & a lot yrs that added fat I'm now a D cup (& in some bras even a DD) & I love that after being small before so I don't think I personally could handle a BMX (still getting used to all the new abbreviations!) without reconstruction. My oncologist has said I will need chemo regardless of what type surgery I have just to clear up anything they didn't locate so I will probably have to wait for reconstruction until that is over. They have said that the reconstruction with my own tissue from somewhere I have extra would be better than implants for me with my other health concerns they don't want to risk having one leak or needing anymore follow up surgeries than absolutely necessary. I'm thrilled that they said they could use from my buttocks because it's too big anyway. Lol. Hubby says he won't care if I have butt boobs. Lol. I don't think I can take the fear of cancer coming back& although I know there is still a very small chance of getting it again even with BMX I will feel better knowing I've done all I can to lessen my risk. I hate the idea of losing my breasts but not so much as to further risk my life so if it is a high likelihood that it will return I think BMX might be the right choice for me.thanks you all for supporting me through this & sharing your knowledge. There really is just so much info to figure out with this that its hard to see everything without help",

The oncologist is referring me to an endocrinologist at their hospital to get my Addisons under control prior to surgery which he thinks I should have first &'then chemo. And also, so he can be part of making our plan because my blood pressure is already very low & they don't want to make it worse with treatments. So as soon as I see the endocronologist & he helps us figure out how to keep the Addisons under control we will schedule surgery so probably in the next week or so we will get it scheduled. And he said he's taking all my medical issues into account to make the cocktail of chemo for me & will be administering stuff to counteract the problems they could cause along with the cocktail. To hopefully avoid any bad things happening because of my other medical problems. That impressed me.",

My HER2/ FISH tests are still out ,so is the genetics testing, but I do have a family history of cancer (breast, skin &'lung cancer). There are 2 separate masses about 2 inches apart one just over 1 cm the other aprox 3/4 cm.The larger is stage 1 &'the smaller stage 0. They do not believe there is any lymph node involvement ormother spreading but obviously that can not be 100%. The genetics counselor made it sound like I have a high likelihood of other masses in the same or the other breast later because of having 2 separate & because of family history. The surgeon basically gave me 3'options: lumpectomy & chemo with high risk of other rumors devoloping over time, single mastectomy with very little chance of any further issues in the right breast but possibility of rumors developing over time in the left, Double mastectomy & chemo to put my chances of any recurrences extremely low. I know no one can tell me what to do but I'd love your opinions. It's a horrible choice either way but I'm terrified of this all happening again & next time ending up to be even worse. I would get reconstruction with either mastectomy choice. Luckily my insurance covers that . I just don't know if I'm overreacting to the odds of recurrence. I've been reading all the info I can find on reputable sites but it's different than hearing other people that have gone through the same thing. & hearing what choices you made & why I just know I'm 50 & don't have very good health anyway so going through this once will be difficult to do. & keep my other health issues stable, but doing it twice will be even harder.",
