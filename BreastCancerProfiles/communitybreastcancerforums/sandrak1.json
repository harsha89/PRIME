The tech said if I didn't get a call by Friday that I was good to go because they wouldn't let me go the weekend if the mammogram  found something. I didn't get a call, so should I just let this go? Or should I go see a breast specialist. It would be nice to know the cause of the retraction even if it is innocent. At least I could stop worrying about this. ",

I had mammograms and an ultrasound which showed nothing concerning. Now I think the retraction is somewhat worse especially when I flex or bend over. I also have pains in that breast. I am going for my annual mammo next Thursday. If this also shows nothing, should I ask to be referred to a breast specialist? I would like to know what is causing the retraction even if it is innocent. The retraction is affecting one side of my nipple that extends into my areola. I'm 45 yrs old. Thanks for any advice.
