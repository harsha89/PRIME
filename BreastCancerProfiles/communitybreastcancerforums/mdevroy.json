Not sure what kind of surgery yet I will find out on July 2 after the genetics testing and all the scans are in. If its a lumpectomy i will then go to 6 weeks of everyday radiation. After that every three weeks of herceptin till April 2019. I just want to get back to normal. So far i have been working full time think that will change after surgery. i just want to be back to my self again",
