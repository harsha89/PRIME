This is my second go round with BC. The first was 9 years ago, DCIS right breast, had lumpectomy with all lymph nodes removed and 33 rounds of radiation. I was put on Tamoxifen, but due to se's was unable to continue. In place of that, I had my ovaries removed in April 2002. In Nov. 2009 my mammogram picked up a shadow on same breast, so was sent for an ultrasound, then core biopsy. On Dec. 21st, I got the call saying my cancer had returned. I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Co-ordinating surgeons schedules proved to be a bit difficult, but I finally got a surgery date for Mar.5, 2010. Had the surgery done, and 300cc tissue expanders in place. Wow those things are more uncomfortable than I had imagined. I've only had one fill so far, as the previously radiated side is very tight and could only take 30cc's. Its looking like this will be a long process.The core biopsy said I was ER/PR+ HER2+2. The final pathology said I was ER/PR+ and HER2-. So they had to do a FISH test which came back neg. My cancer Onclogist had a meeting with the board of Oncologists, and they all felt very strongly that I would benefit significally from having chemo and possibly hormonal therapy. Now I'm just waiting for a date, and treatment plan. I'm glad I found this board, to help prepare for the next few months and meet some wonderful new friends!  Cindy diagnosis 12/21/2009, IDC, 2cm, grade 3, ER/PR+  HER2-",
