I go to the oncologist tomorrow to find out what the last month has been on tumor markers...doctor wasn't ready to accept the \"no isotonic evidence of metastatic disease\" last month...my thought is: \"DUH, if you don't accept the results, then why did you put me on it in the first place???\". Now she wants me to have a colonoscopy because my CEA is irractic (going down but up slightly every other month). My thoughts on that: \"Xeloda is the drug of choice for colon cancer; again, DUH, wouldn't that take care of any colon problems?\"",

My story is similar...Arimidex, Faslodex, Taxol and now Xeloda...and my tumor markers are going way down too...but more importantly, my bone scan from 7/13 shows \"no isotonic evidence of metastatic disease\"...so WOOHOO...of course my oncologist is trying to find a scientific reason behind all this...me...I just accept it as a miracle...through the Xeloda...maybe...who cares...it is what it is...or should I say \"what it isn't\". I accept it with a grateful heart as I'm sure you do. My oncologist just this month switched me from 2wks on/1 off to 1 week on 1 week off...she went to another bc seminar in Boston and new info says that the first week on is the \"irradicating\" week and the second week is just toxins to us...so they are doing 1 on and 1 off. So far there are less tummy side effects and no hand/foot...but then I'm only on 2000 and have always been on that...for 7 cycles. Works for me...and I can't state emphatically enough that I am so happy for you!!!",

Although we are saddened by the addition of another sister we care enough to offer whatever support we can. I had 7-1/2 years of NED and then a backache prompted an MRI which led to bone mets to spine, hips, pelvis, femurs, skull. Started out on Arimidex and then Faslodex and then Taxol. Had a port put in and got blood clot and was put on Warfarin for that and then Xeloda and continuing Zometa. Am doing very well...no side effects and tumor markers are going down. My Xeloda dose is only 2000 mgs a day to minimize side effects but it is working nonetheless. This past bone scan, as compared to one in March, showed \"no isostonic evidence of disease\"....so I told my doctor I believe in miracles...she doesn't and feels it's a poor read on bone scan...even though it was done by 2 different radiologists!!! Anyway, I have my days of being tired...have given up motorcycle riding and camping...now we take 3-4 trips a year by plane...to a nice hotel...to swim and relax and sightsee....I suppose in some ways it has altered my quality of life...but, hey, this first class style suits me just fine...all I did was give up vacuuming, raking leaves, shoveling snow...can't beat that!!! Come here often and let it all out...we all understand even if we are not identical in symptoms or diagnosis...we are right up there with you in emotions and thoughts and fears....",
