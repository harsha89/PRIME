Going back on Wednesday 10th to have drain taken out. Will find out then how many other lymph nodes had cancer and of course to see if I get clear margins!! Will start chemo next month regardless. Then radiation. Surgery went good and I feel really good for just having surgery a few days ago. Pain was just the first day and wasn't anything that a pill didn't take care of. The hardest part for me is sitting around getting waited on. Good luck and let me know how you are doing.",

Found out 26 nodes were removed and 20 of them had cancer in them. Some good news, clear margins!! Will start chemo next month. My arms are really achey. Totally did not expect this. My breasts and entire chest area feels fine. Wondering if anyone else has had this happen.",
