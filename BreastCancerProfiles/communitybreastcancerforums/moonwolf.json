I was very disappointed to hear that, but it seems I can afterall.     I will wait for a year tho.  Meanwhile, I have been tanning the rest of me whilst keeping the rads area well covered.   I finished rads this week. Actually, we do need fifteen minutes a day unprotected exposure to get enough vitimin D.  Lack of vit D puts one at more risk of cancer!",
