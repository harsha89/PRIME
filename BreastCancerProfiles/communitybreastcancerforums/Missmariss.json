I just had my 6th breast biopsy on my left breast this past Tuesday December 5th I am still waiting on the results . I have ADH every 6 month appt ends up with a biopsy..I had a surgical biopsy and a lumpectomy last year and was put on Tamoxifen as a preventative, I feel like I a walking time bomb. I had the genetic testing done and both were negative. So as a result of that my breast is scarred mishapened and painful all the time.",

But a week before my surgery I had crazy boob dreams, I dreamed I woke up from surgery with a long boob on my chest another night a boob was planted on my forehead etc , just crazy shit. By nature I am a strong woman and I don't have anxiety issues so I was surprised about my anxiety and these wacky dreams. Good luck with your surgery and you will be fine..",
