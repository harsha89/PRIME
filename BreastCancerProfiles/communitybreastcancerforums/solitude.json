Overall severe flu like symptoms. First and second day manageable then the next 3 days horrible. Second infusion June 16th different. I started taking claritin three days prior to chemo and continued 3 days after. I realized I did not take the correct amount of steroid the first time. I also waited 48 hours for my Neulasta injection. The symptoms much more manageable. I was still unwell with severe stomach cramps, no appetite, headache and flu like symptoms lingered for 7 days. Still happening.",

I have an appointment with surgeon oncologist April 26th for final pathology & treatment plan. I've read all the imaging results and medical notes. I'm exhausted wondering whether my nodes are affected. Despite trying I can't seem to stop obsessing about the outcome. The MRI said nodes looked good. The surgeon removed 6 nodes. He said they look good however they were firm and initial ultra sound showed concern in a node. Anyone else have this dilemma and what was the outcome?
