I can't say I had any real pain. Just a pinch fro the injections and then a bit of pressure. The radiologist should explain every step to you. Don't be afraid to ask!! the worst thing you can do is go home without knowing what they did and what it might mean. If you are becoming anxious or stressed, ask your doc for something to take the edge off. I went on Xanax last year as soon as she told me my diagnosis. After my mastectomy, I switched to Zoloft and that has done the trick for the most part. I still need a little extra \"boost\" sometimes but for the most part, I'm okay. Let us know what's going on. You are not alone; we've all got your back. Ann/Snickersmom",

Because of the size of my tumor and the fact that no lymph nodes were involved, they felt chemo and radiation would probably do more harm than good and I would not benefit from either. So I am on AI for 3-5 years instead.

I did have hot flashes and a few night sweats when I first started taking it but after a few months, they pretty much went away. I sometimes am achy in the morning but after I move around a bit, that stops. I already was on Zoloft when I started the Anastrozole so I have no idea what I would be like without my Zoloft! That keeps me on an even keel most of the time or until somebody says something really stupid to me about breast cancer. I also have Xanax (low dose) for when I need a little extra, usually when I get anxious or edgy. But that doesn't happen too often. Biggest issue for me is the memory problems. I'm already 71 so probably it's a combo of the Anastrozole and age, but it sure is frustrating! I was already on Gabapentin for herniated lumbar discs, so that probably has helped a lot. I still get shooters in my chest area here and there, but it's the nerves and there's not much I can do about them. I hope they can find something for you to take that will agree with you. I was Stage 1A with no nodes involved, so I will be on Anastrozole for 5 years but my MO says that should be enough.",

My mum died of natural causes (who does that??) at 104 and my dad was 96 when he died, also of natural causes. Mum was amazing - she never took a pill her whole life but did drink a Guinness every day for either dinner or lunch for years. We all laugh and say that's what kept her so healthy!

I have foobs I can wear or I can go au natural, whichever I pick. Most of the time I go natural but foobs do make me feel better about how I look, so I am glad I have a choice. I will be on Arimidex for at least another 4 years. Side effects aren't too bad and I can manage them. The worst is what it does to my memory. but I'm alive, so I try toconcentrate on that instead of the negative side. Hope you all have a good night! ",

I did call my 3 grown daughters and my sister (they all live in another state). It never occurred to me to not tell them as soon as I knew I had bc. We have a large group of friends/neighbors where we live, and I sat down and wrote them all an email, telling them of my diagnosis and my wish to be just treated normally. They were all great and other than hugs initially, they didn't treat me differently. When I had my surgery, one of my neighbors organized dinners for us every night for a month. So for me, telling people wa the right ting to do. But I never said a word on FB. And I still haven't. I had so much wonderful support from friends and family and I definitely needed that, so I was glad I told people. As for anxiety, get something to take the edge off! I started on Xanax initially but have been switched to Zoloft and that's okay with me. It has been a life saver. I never went through the angry or the why me stages, but that's what I am dealing with now, nearly 9 months later. I guess it's normal to go through the grieving but I thought it would be right after surgery. Everyone's different, I'm told. I did read a lot when I was first diagnosed but quickly realized that since I wouldn't know what stage or grade I definitely was until my surgery, there was no point in trying to self-diagnose or second guess my treatment. Dr. Google and Dr. Bing are definitely not your friends right now. Hang in there and keep coming here with thoughts, questions, fears, etc. e all know just how you feel and what you are going through. You will get through this and will make the choices that are right for you. ",

I was uncomfortable for a week or so but not really any pain. I had no problem with using the toilet or wiping myself. The hardest thing for me was taking a shower (you can't until a couple of days after surgery) because you will have drains and you need something to hold them. Your hospital should, hopefully, give you a kind of camisole that closes in the front, and that has drain holders on each side. But before your surgery, I recommend you get in touch with your local American Cancer Society office and ask if they have any kind of drain holders. I sent away for Pink Pockets and they can get them to you pretty fast, I think. Just google Pink Pockets and you should be able to find them. I have several at home but we are traveling and there's no way I could get them to you before next week. so back to your questions. There wasn't much I couldn't do for myself, as I stayed in a nightgown or pajamas for the first week or so until my drains came out at my post-op appointment> You will have to be careful reaching over your head, picking up heavy stuff, etc. but they should give you a list of things you shouldn't do. I was also sent to the lymphodema clinic, once before surgery and once afterward. They will also tell you what not to do. My husband and I put a couple of lightweight plastic dinner and lunch plates, coffee mug, glass, etc. on the counter so that I could get them easily if he wasn't home. We also had a cleaning lady come in every other week for about 2 months just to take care of the floors and bathrooms. Just baby yourself and let yourself be waited on if possible. I found that the physical part was nothing but I am still dealing with the emotional and psychological aspects. I thought that at 70, I would have no problem dealing with the whole thing but that has not been the case. So if you find that you are having trouble emotionally, tell your doctors. They will help you with that, either through medication or counseling. I have both. Are you having any reconstruction? I opted not to bother and I don't regret the decision. It has taken some adjustment, but I think I do pretty well with it. I'm comfortable wearing the occasional sports bra when needed. Otherwise, I go flat and I absolutely love not tugging at a bra, feeling the sweat run down between my boobs, etc. I live in florida, so that was always an issue for me. Well, I didn't mean to write a book! I wish I had been smart enough to ask the questions you've asked before I had surgery. You will do just fine. You will be in my prayers; please keep posting here so we know how you are doing. And don't be afraid to ask questions!!!! Ann",
