My doctor just started me with zometa last week but my zoladex has not been approved yet. I am still waiting and am getting frustrated. I complaine of numbess on my right lower mouth between the lips and jaw and now my onc is sending me for an MRI of the brain and neck. While at this time, we are still waiting for bone biopsy results. I am almost done with 10 session of rads to my spine and sacrum. Why is it taking for them so long to give me my treatment regiment.
