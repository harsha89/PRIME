She came to me with a question regarding her breasts and I did not hesitate to tell her she needed to see a doctor and push for answers if she was feeling uneasy. She came to me with complaints about an indentation or a dent on both of her areolas. She noticed them a couple months ago and they haven't ever went away. She is not pregnant or breastfeeding. She doesn't have any pain or anything. She has an appointment with the gynecologist tomorrow. My question to you ladies is, have you ever experienced this in both breasts and it was benign? :( Obviously my case was the exception to the rule. Thank you ladies! I'll let everyone know what goes on with my cousin. Dx at 19 years old. I am currently 20. I am a mother of a 6 year old cat named Ryan. He is my little angel!
