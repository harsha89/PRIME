I have to force myself to do this but it is so important.  My \"bad days\" have lasted longer and longer with each round.  First round was 4 days, last round was 10 days.  I'm told these last two weeks on AC could be at least 10 days possibly more due to the cumulative effect of the chemo.  So you see, working is out of the question for me.  I hated having to take medical leave, but there was no way I could work, especially when besides working 8 hours a day, I have a one hour commute each way by car.  At first I felt very guilty about taking leave.  But everyone, including my boss and co-workers, made me realize I needed to take care of ME and that the job was secondary to my health.  I don't know how I'll be on the Taxol, supposedly the effects are much less - so I may be able to return to work.  I know I'm ready - very bored  - at least on my good days - LOL!    I thought I needed the job to keep my mind busy and off the \"cancer\".  Those first 2 weeks were hard, not working, feeling crappy, and feeling sorry for myself.  But once everyone convinced me to take care of me, and listen to my body, it got easier.  I feel much better emotionally as the time has passed.  So Shonda, do what is best for you.  You come first before your job.  Don't put pressure on yourself that way I did.   Listen to your body and OBEY it - LOL!!!   Hopefully you will be able to work and continue pretty much normally.  Normal is good and I can't wait for it to get here again. Good Luck Zuffa.  It goes by fast, and you'll be through this before you know it.",

I got zapped again! LOL.  Man, that will wake you up and bring you back to reality real fast!!!!  I will tell my dr about this on Monday, which will be my first visit with the oncologist to, I assume, discuss the course of treatments to come, which my surgeon said would be rad and chemo.  Oh joy!  But, as long as I wake up every day and take a breath, I'll consider myself lucky.  Thanks again.  Best of luck and warm hugs to each of you. ",

Okay... bottom line, I was just diagnosed yesterday - I have Stage IV Advanced Mets Lungs (lymph nodes and lung spots) and Bones (spine) and there are a few more suspicious areas in my chest wall.  So, that said... I still have to go for more testing.... another bone scan on Friday to correlate to the PET-CT scan I had on 9/1/10; I may have to have another lung biopsy and if I don't get into this trial the onco wants me to try, then I may have to have another port put in on Friday, as well - if I am not accepted into the trial.  I've been doing pretty good emotionally, a bit stressed today since the thoracic doc I saw this morning was so fast and out of the blue.  But I got past that.  Then, stupid stupid me... ( I have a love/hate relationshp with the internet) I started reserach this new diagnosis and frankly, it could scare the crap out of me if I was trusting in the Lord.  I saw that only about 20% of women survive past 5 years... and then there was the average survival rate of 16%....  that's could scare ya for sure and it did at first.  But then I recalled that I was trusting in the Lord for peace and strength.  I also remember Kay Yow, and though I am certainly not her nor do I pretend to have her strength, I will fight with everything my skinny (and skinnier) little body has to give. Onco wants to put me into a trial:  Faslodex and Dasatinib combo.  We'll give it a 4 months and if nothing happens or I get worse, we will switch to conventional chemo.  This trial is done by pills everyday (Dasatinib) and once monthly injections of Faslodex.  I also had my first Aredia treatment yesterday - that will also be monthly.  So everyone, I'm open to your thoughts.   (P.S. I cried today at the thoughts of my daughter having to go through this with me, and the fear that someday it could happen to her.) Welela - Never Give Up!
