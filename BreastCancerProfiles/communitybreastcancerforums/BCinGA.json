I thought I would be in the March surgery list so I've been lurking, but I found out today that I'll be having a lumpectomy on Feb 28th. We've waited so long for so many test results that I'm glad the surgery part will (hopefully) be over soon. My mass is right under the edge of my nipple, so there is a good chance they'll have to take it. I'm option out of reconstruction during the surgery, but who knows what the future holds. I wish everyone luck in their surgery!",

I had a tangle of 3 lymph nodes in a cluster, which they said was odd. The nodes looked healthy so they didn't remove any more. I came out from anesthesia easily and have had no nausea. I've got some pain meds to take for a few days. I don't get to remove my bandages for 48 hours, so I have no idea what the area looks like. My throat is sore from the intubation, but I doubt that will last long. I am allergic to latex and have a mild reaction to paper tape, so I have a nice line across my face where the breathing tube was held in place as well as what looks to be an octopus attack to the torso (where my EKG pads were). My bandaged area is super itchy, but nothing can be done about that. All in all the surgery was about what I expected. I'll give it a few days and then update again. Glad to hear everyone else from the past few days is doing well!",
