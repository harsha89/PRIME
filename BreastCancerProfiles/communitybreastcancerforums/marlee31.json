I had pain in my left breast, particularly around the nipple. It hurts when touched and when I hug people. I have had breast tenderness before but this was different. I never had nipple discharge. One day, I was taking off the clothes and bra. I felt wetness on my fingers. I was confused and then discovered that I brushed against my left nipple. There was discharge and I felt something underneath the nipple. I squeezed a bit more to see what it is. A thick white stuff came out and then it became clear. I was so confused by this. The pain got milder but the left nipple still sticks out while my right nipple is just flat. Because this is the first time this is happening to me, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor just to check it out. I recalled that I had persistent itchy breasts (even the left nipple itched too) a few weeks ago. I thought it could be due to sweat or dirty bra. Now I have shoulder pain/upper back/near shoulder blade pain since last Saturday. I tried stretching and it still didn't get better. I'm trying to stay calm and hope that it is either hormonal changes or cyst. Have you experienced this before? What should I expect if my doctor wants to do further testing? Log in to post a reply",
