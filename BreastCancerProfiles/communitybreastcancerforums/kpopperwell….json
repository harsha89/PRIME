Have a good day Karin in CA ",

I only have 3 boosts left and then I will have 4 straight days off from work.  I will help but it will not be enough but we are short handed at work.  I have also used DH soft cotton handkerchiefs to put under the breast to absorb moisture and to pad the underarm when I wear tank tops to keep the arm from contact with area. I hope that you do not get too many of the se's. Take care, Karin in CA ",

What do you think?  Thanks Karin in CA . p.s. I will be done on July 23, yay!!!!  Onco Dx 8, No Chemo, Arimidex for 5 years Dx 2/16/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I look forward to meeting all of you. ",
