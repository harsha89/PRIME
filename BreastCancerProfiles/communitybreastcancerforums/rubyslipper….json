I had my first chemo/HER2 treatment 2 1/2 weeks ago and I was fine for three days after, but then I got extremely nauseous and sick (vomiting/diarrhea) to the point where I couldn't drink or eat anything. They gave me anti-nausea medicine, but since it was the first time I was experimenting to see which one/both worked and ended up having to go in for fluids. Outside of trying to drink as much water as possible, is there anything else you recommend that I do to prevent it from getting that bad? I also ended up in the hospital for 4 days due to a .9 white blood cell count. Thankfully I will get the Neulasta shot for the upcoming treatments, but I'm young and healthy so they don't know why I had such a severe reaction. Look forward to any help/advice. I thank you so much for the help. Jen",
