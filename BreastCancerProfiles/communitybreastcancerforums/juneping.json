Bc she's the only one has to live with the consequence.  Some ppl have absolutely no problem after chemo and even say they felt better than pre cancer. And some got serious SE after only one TX. No one knows.  If your sis's BC is not the aggressive kind  may be she can start reading some books about BC. If it's the aggressive kind then she needs to make a decision quick. But regardless, I wouldn't wait more than three months to start any kind of TX. Look at her biopsy report and see what it says. It's a serous decision and I would highly recommend to look at it from all angles then make a decision.  Like lily said, have the surgery first and make the decision base on the pathology report. Even tho the new trend is to shrink the tumor first then cut it out but it's her body and she should be able to demand a more conservative method for her body. Her doc should be able to respect that.  I also don't think doc wants to make money hence recommends chemo. But bc that's all they know. And that's all they teach at med school.  My experiece with my sis was I didn't want to share too much with her bc she didn't know much about BC. But when she came to take care of me after the surgery....I was so touched that she actually studied about BC and it was so easy to communicate with her. So I would suggest you do some homework and understand all kinds of BC...make notes if you have to and talk to her. Once she realizes you do understand BC....she will open up. ",

Pre-menopausal women must have breast cancer surgery in the last two weeks of their cycle Dr Paul Layman wrote to us to clear up an error in the Tony Howell interview. Paul writes, \"An eighteen year study on the protective effect of natural progesterone has recently been confirmed. The oestrogen receptor status of breast cancer is now thought to be of significance in recurrence rates, but the Imperial College study seemed to suggest that the timing of breast surgery was even more important than receptor status\". And he is perfectly correct. Choosing the correct point in your monthly cycle to have a breast operation can increase your 10-year survival chances by two thirds! Every woman and their doctor should know this fact. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (Cancer, 15 Nov 1999) states clearly that \"Women having breast tumours removed during the follicular phase of their cycle (that is days 3-12 when their oestrogen is high) have a 10-year survival rate of only 45 per cent, compared to a 10-year survival rate of 75 per cent for women having surgery during the luteal phase (when progesterone is high).\" Indeed the research also showed that oestrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive tumours had the highest survival rates if surgery was performed in the second half of a woman´s cycle. This work confirmed an earlier study from Guy´s Hospital by Cooper, Gillett, Patel, Barnes and Fentiman in August 1999 and yet earlier work by Hrushesky et al (Lancet 1989). juneping.wordpress.com/ Dx 11/15/2013, DCIS Dx 11/15/2013, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 2/35 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Just want to throw the info out there in case ppl are looking for flying and LE.  I don't have LE and wear sleeve for preventative purpose. I ran out of time couldnt find a compression tshirt. The flight was 16 hours and I had the sleeve and the gauntlet on and I was okay. Side note, bc of flight delay and cancellation I had the sleeve on for over 12 hour before flying. Not sure that helped or not. My sis did some research for me that wearing it longer before and after long flight is crucial but I am sure not 12 hours long like I did. I was very relieved no swelling after the long flight.",

She's laid back enough to let me let me ask questions and didn't throw radiation chemo in my face. I sort of appreciate that. She did say I would need a mastectomy which she always try to avoid. Her nurse is a god sent and she actually told me I am estrogen and p....positive and waiting for the HER come back. She also told me my cancer is the slow growing kind. I feel i am handled by a very good team. Already scheduled for the surgery on 12/19.....can't wait to get it over with Btw, she told me bilateral is not changing much for survival rate. Since mastectomy only removing 97% breast tissue. She seems to be conservative to remove both. That I also appreciate. She sees me as a person not a cancer container",

IF it's the later case, the medical field just need to put the ovaries to sleep and we don't have to go thru harsh chemo. but it's just a theory. from what i read in the alternative thread, some women are able to stay NED. so it seems it's logical.",
