I will have the one surgeon working on my breast, the plastic surgeon to put in expanders at the same time and the OB GYN doing the hysterectomy. All three surgeons have worked together in the past on patients so I feel confident I am in good hands. It was hard to decide what I wanted to do, but I do not feel safe waiting to do two different surgeries. I am scared, a little scared they will find something unusal as my previous OB GYN messed up many patients according to my new doctor who had to fix many of those. I am BRCA2 positive and 43 years old. Much of my moms family has had cancer, younger than me even. The Oncologist I saw recommended I get these procedures done due to extensive history and highly recommended this team of doctors. One of my Aunts tells me not to get them both done at the same time, but I really feel in my gut I need to. She had expanders in for 9 months prior to her implants. But also, I think that her situation was far worse than mine as she also had cancer and chemo and radiation to deal with at the same time. I have some reasons to do it together, One I fear if I got one done, it would make me not want to get the other one done later as I have extreme anxiety issues. Other is the insurance part. I will pay less as my max out of pocket is $5,000. If I did them seperate and one next year, that a whole other $5,000. Plus the time off of work. I have temporary disability for up to 3 months and dont think I can do that twice in a 12 month period. the OB GYN said that the hysterectomy will be pretty straightforward, 3 small incisions, not like the 6 inch scar I have from my ovary removal 10 years ago and I should be able to drive the next day. Of course, I wont be, because I will be having the Mastectomies done too. I realize that this will be the most extensive op, as the PS said that I had to have the expanders in first unless I went considerably smaller in size and I do not want that. Not looking forward to it, but my aunt is kind of making me feel like my choice is a bad one. I am going in with a positive attitude and knowledge that it will not be easy. I feel though that if the doctors did not think that a person could handle it they would not all be suggesting it right? Because they all have done similar procedures together many times. I am scheduling off 2 months of work for recovery. Doctors were telling me 6-8 weeks and actually not going to go back until after the first of the year so essentially 9 weeks. My boss is going to freak out though as I work retail and I will be gone through the whole 4th quarter essentially. I am just looking for support, as obviously I am nervous. Pretty sure that I will make it through the surgery (my constant phobia of death doesnt help) but that is what is also pushing me to do this to avoid cancer later. Any advice would be welcome about recovery. I wont change my mind about getting it all done at the same time, unless the doctors have some doubts about it. Log in to post a reply",
