As to the sentinel node pain, what happened with me is that the dye didn't go into the sentinel node. It never showed up after the radioactive injection, so My BS just grabbed a gob of stuff out of my armpit and had it biopsied. Of course, there were several nodes in it. They were clean. But I have the pain you described only it's down the back of my arm. And honestly, now at six months it is much less sharp and happens less often. Please let us know how you fare with this new development pain-wise and recovery-wise, and especially malignancy-wise.",

My mother, my kids, and my friends sat by feeling helpless. I wish I hadn't done that. But, it is what I felt. I guess it was partly post-surgical and mostly the awful dawning fact that I really did have cancer. Also, there are the sleep problems that go with a mastectomy. The sleeping on my back is like an unnatural act. I went on anti-depressants, but still I get what I call \"breakthrough weeping.\" I've seldom been depressed in my life, and I have to say, I''m impressed.

I felt like the dickens and he didn't decide to take it out until I couldn't stop crying. What was left was this funny drain that looked like half a rubber tube rolled into a hole in my ex-breast. It drained for a few weeks into gauze pads that I changed often. Towards the end, it sucked air and sounded funny. Anyway, I went home with one side flat and one side expanding. I was depressed and embarrassed . I thought I looked like a freak. At first I wore bras with whatever stuck in them. Then I discovered that, frankly, nobody looks at you. I began to wear these cute little smock tops and didin't bother with stuffing the flat side.Then after a while, I was actually proud of it.  I've been through a lot, folks, and don't you forget it. But here's what I learned.. I Do want reconstruction. Given one side all puckered and sad, and the other side, expanding, square, uncomfortable, but hopeful... I'll take my chances with more reconstruction. Three months after the staph debacle, on July 23, I went back and got an expander put back in the right side. The surgery should have taken 2 hours, but it took 4 and a half because the \"minimal staph contamination (docs words) had decimated my pectoralis major and he had to patch and repair with alloderm. Also, it had tunneled between my breast site and my underarm, so he had to fix that too. It is a month since that surgery...my third counting the blm, and I am tired, I take too many pills many of which are psychotropic...xanax, amytriptaline. And one big one for my blood pressure which may be closely associated to my psychological condition. I do relaxation exercises when I take my mandatory nap. I read Thich Nhat Han. Try to live in the moment. What do I have now. One great squarish expander, and one new miniature one that actually has a certain breast-like roundness to it. That is the new right one.Still wearing my little Target smock shirts. I have to drive to Denver from the Western Slope of Colorado for fills. (Cancelled next week's due to the democratic convention.) And, given that all things go well, I have one more surgery. That will make four surgeries. Two of them so far have exceeded all my notions of how long it is good to be artificially anesthetized. Oh, yes, my dear, this is a big setback. You can do it. And the more you look at your flat side and eventually palpate that concavity that is left after your breast is gone, the more determined you are to make it work. Somebody told me that I had to expect to give this cancer experience a year of my life. I thought because I was fit and strong and psychologically solid, that maybe I could beat that. But the truth is, that including the reconstruction, I'll be lucky if a year covers it. Either way. I'm alive and it's a beautiful day! Good luck to you, girl. My heart is so with you.",

Viktoria, I have to tell you that my first meltdown came when I realized I had to go back home with \"one shoe on and one shoe off.\" Mine wasn't because of a nutcase surgeon, because I had a bilateral. But I was going home with only one expander and the other a little ruined pucker of ugly flesh. I cried and cried. They called the social worker, and I told her I was afraid people would look at me.She was about 10 years old and wrote down everything I said, and used her best Rogerian technique. I went home, bought about seven smocked tops from Target... they're quite the style right now. I got a padded bra and put whatever I could find in the flat side. Those round nursing pads gave it a little bit of lift. I tried a sock...mmm socks are for feets not fronts. I even filled a toe of a little footlet sock with millet and tied if off in a  knot that was supposed to simulate a nipple. ( Got  that off the internet.)Not a great solution either. Got the giggles when I realized that the darned stuff could germinate in there and I could have sprouts for dinner. Finally, I realized that NOBODY'S LOOKING AT MY BREASTS! Now that's the common ordinary truth. We are all little floating islands, barely noticing each other. This one is worried about her hair. That one is thinking about his stomach. Another is thinking about her protuding teeth, but nobody gives a sh..t about our breasts. After awhile, I wore the different size breasts with pride. I've been through a lot. And if anyone notices, good for them, maybe they've stepped outside the vortex of their own narcissism. Give them gratitude and move on. I hate to think how afraid I was to be seen all lopsided. It was a fear with absolutely no ground. Anybody need a bag of millet?",
