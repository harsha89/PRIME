My onc said OK to removal a few months after I finished treatment, that was about a year ago in May 2013.   And then stage 4  August 2013,  Tykerb at home and herceptin every 3 weeks.  So far so good without the port, tho my Onc keeps bringing it up.  My veins are holding up and the longer I can go the better.  We all make our own decisions  and I am very grateful to have an onc who will go with my preference,even if it is not his!     And when it goes in - it will be for the rest of my life - ick.  I hope it to be a long and happy  life and I would prefer to go as long as possible without the port",

I made a decision not to share, didn't want the burden of all the questions etc. I do not even tell all the members of my posse when scans are coming up - \"sometime in the next few months, need to discuss the date with doc\" Or something like that. Also did not share with my children 19 and 15. I feel like when there is something for them to know, I will share, but right now there is nothing for them to know. I have my \"posse\" for support when I need it and felt like if others knew it would put more of a strain on me than I was willing to deal with. Treatment right now does not involve hair loss, so I can fly under the radar. Somewhat more fatigued, but seem to be able to manage that to a great degree. So I don't feel like I am lying all the time (for folks who are unaware) my response to how are you doing after the last year is \"I feel well today and am doing well, and I think that is the most any of us can hope for!\" Folks seem to go with that response. I spent many years in catholic school where lying to the nuns saved my sorry butt more than once. It is a skill I use when needed! Be well Nel",

The port placement was fairly easy - home the same day with some aches, nothing a bit of advil didin't address.  You will be glad you have it. I did all the same chemos as well.  I did cut my hair short before it fell out - It helped me in the transition and I think my kids.  I only wore a wig a few times, baseball caps were my headcovering of choice.   A suggestion I saw on these boards - use a lint roller as you hair starts to fall out.  It catched the hair and oohh did it help the itch.  My dd and I still laugh about her walking into the kitchen and me  lint rolling my hair.  She was 13 at the time!  My kids already know I am a bit crazy  - so some of my behaviors during treatment just reinforced the notion.  So remember to laugh and help you son to laugh as well.  Think about getting a wig or scarves now.  Even if you don't use them much, you will have them when you need them. I had some nausea, no vomiting but they give you many pre-meds that it was manageable. I gained a few pounds, nothing outrageous.  Taste was a bit of an issue, but you will figure out what you want to eat and what you don't.  My onc told me to eat as healthy as I could, but not to make myself crazy if there were days whenmy appetitie was not great.  There were tears when I initially told my kids, they were 17 and 13, they both have friends whose Mom's have passed from BC.  But once I began treatment and they saw me getting thru most days reasonably well, they and I htink all of us felt better.  I was separated, but their dad did help with some things, driving to and from school or activites ondays when I just was really tired.  But i still shouldered most everything with them.  One of my treatment days withAC, I came home and took my son for his driving road test.  My ex couldn't take him, even tho that was the plan, he couldn't find his license!  So really it is amazing the strength we can muster for our children.    Your clinc should have books or resources for your son, I gave the schools a heads up just in case there were issues there.  Friends had meals deliveered or brought them in. I could have done it, but some days it was great just to not have to either tired or you just don't feel like eating and it is great to have something there to readily heat up. You will be able to do this.  I am sure like many of us you are are a strong independent woman,not used to taking any help from anyone.  That was the biggest adjustment for me.  Paid a cleaning lady, took meals when offerred and moved along.  Take the help when you need it and if there are specific things you need - ask .  Be wel and stay in touch.

I did have a wig, wore it only 2 or 3 times, way too itchy and I did not like the way it looked. Didn't like the scarf look, too obvious as well, so wore baseball caps when I was out. At home and work, just rocked it bald. Knowing that at some point I will end up on a treatment where I loose my hair again, I dread it. It is not the bald for me , it is the pity. Be well nel",

I am figuring out how to manage the bouts of needing a bathroom with immodium and am finding a balance between being constipated, too much imoduum, and diarrhea, not enough. It is taking a bit of tinkering. That being said, nothing that has kept me from leaving the house which seems to be my onc's criteria for a significant problem. I have had a few issues of skin near my nails splitting, but am using Udderly Smooth and all is good again. Not sure how the xeloda adds or changes things , but the tykerb Herceptin combo is pretty manageable at this point. Some fatigue, equals more naps and to bed a bit earlier. MY QOL is good, working, kids, house and time with friends, just all at a somewhat different pace. Hope this helps. Be well nel",
