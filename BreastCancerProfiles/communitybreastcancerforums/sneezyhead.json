Have been taking immodium with every loose bowel movement and that seems to help a little but wow, I'm sort of wracked. Any tips on how to get rid of it? This was so not a problem with the first round. I've been only eating BRAT food and have a hard time with that not hurting my stomach. I'm hydrating okay, but funky mouth taste makes it hard, but have been diluting sports drinks and that seems to help. Have to say that this week, chemo is kicking my ass.",
