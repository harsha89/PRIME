I now have a hospital appointment to have tests on my breasts & I was told it'd be an all day appointment & that I might get the results same day. I asked about the procedure & what to expect & the lady at the other end of the phone was clueless completely. She said \"I've never had tests myself before so I can't tell you what to expect or what kind of tests they do\" (great attitude from someone who works at a breast cancer clinic I must say). I have no idea at all what type of test/s I'm going in for so am looking for some guidance. I'm 32 & have 36F breasts, very very heavy & I doubt a mammogram would be any good. I've had an ultrasound before & that seemed to be OK but I'm going to have the brown discharge checked out & also a couple of lumps. What tests do they do & do any involve an operation? As in, am I likely to be given a general anaesthetic at all because I am a bit phobic of that. If I have a biopsy, how bad does it hurt & can they give a local anaesthetic for it? So many questions are whirling round in my head now I don't know where to start! Also, my partner has taken the day off work to come with me - will he be allowed to be with me at all times while I have whatever tests they're doing? There are 3 types of people in this world, those who can count & those who can't! Log in to post a reply",
