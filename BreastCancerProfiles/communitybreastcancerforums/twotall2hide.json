Stage 2b, one node involved, er/pr postiive and HER2 negative. I had my lumpectomy last week and will start my chemo in a week. My doc let me know that my hair typically will fall out around the 17th day of treatment. Any recomendations for nice scarves, hat or wigs? If you would be so kind to email me at twotall2hide@gmail.com, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You so much!!  Denise Log in to post a reply",
