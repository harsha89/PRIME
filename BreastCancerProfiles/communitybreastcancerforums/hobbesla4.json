My procedure is not till Sept. 3, and sometimes I wish the time would advance so that it could just be over. I think that you have a positive attitude within yourself already and may not realize it. You have been very strong and brave so far. All of this that you have been dealing with the past few months is certainly not anything that you would expect to happen or want to happen. You will have good days and bad ones. All you can do to stay positive is just try to distract yourself as much as possible. Do something fun. Go visit a friend or spend time with loved ones. Do things that you used to enjoy before cancer turned your life upside down. Hopefully the coming week will be better for you. Remember that all of us are here to vent to, if you need/want to do so. Hugs to you...",

Initially, I was told that they would use temporary tattoos made with Sharpie markers. They later told me on the day of the scans that the tattoos would be permanent because permanent tattoos are better and the machine is more precise that way. These permanent tattoos are about as big as a pencil eraser and are made with needles and ink/henna. The needles do burn or sting as they go into your skin. 2) Radiation itself is not bad so far. The machine I am on is in a prone position. You lay on the table and will hear loud buzzing sounds a few seconds apart. There is no pain involved. 3) Today I had the CT scan for the 5 boosts which will be in a few weeks. What I did not know and wanted to share with you is that for the boosts I will be in a different machine where I will be laying on my back. The technician had to do more radiation tattoos with the needle. I was not aware of any of this before today. 4) Radiation can burn your skin. Mine is holding up pretty well so far. Whenever I began radiation, all the workers said that it would feel like a sunburn. I would have to say that this is not accurate. It is very painful at times and my breast is enlarged and swollen. It is more of a sensation of hurting from inside out than being a sunburn. It is more painful that sunburn. Today my doctor wanted to write a prescription that she said is used on burn patients; however, I am allergic to the components of it. So until I see her next week for a checkup, I will be using Aloe Vera Gel and Aquaphor Baby Ointment three times a day, as my doctor recommended. I also have to take Advil for the pain and use an ice pack to the area if the pain is a stinging type of pain.",

My RO also recommended not using a washcloth to the area when you shower and using a gentle body wash such as Dove or Aveeno. Best of luck with rads.  It is really a pretty simple process.",

I had an MRI done recently and got the report back yesterday. On the lumpectomy side, the MRI detected a large seroma. It is not visible to me. My breast is sometimes painful (feels like the pain is coming from the inside somewhere). Could this be because of the seroma? How long does it take for the seroma to go away or resolve? The MRI also showed a mass on the lumpectomy side which is thought to be likely a fibroadenoma. It also showed scattered foci on the non-lumpectomy side. The recommendations were to have the re-excision due to margins which are not clear and to have another MRI in 6 months to monitor the non-lumpectomy side. My re-excision is scheduled for the middle of next month.",

I wanted to write and let you know about it, so that you could be prepared in case some of the same things happen to you. I had a lumpectomy today. Arrived at the radiology dept. early this a.m. The absolute worst part of the day happened here. I felt very ill prepared for what occurred in the radiology dept. I think it was due to my ignorance. I was not prepared for what happened in the wire placement by the radiologist. How it happened with me was that the radiologist brought me into a room with a mammogram type machine. My breast was compressed and then they proceeded to stick me 5 times and insert two long wires into me. When I say the breast was compressed, I mean that it was compressed in the machine for 1 hour and 15 minutes. There were very few times during that time when I could move at all. During the entire test they would compress you and tell you not to move or breathe. Then after they took the pictures they would let you breathe. They did not use enough numbing medicine, but at that point, I just wanted the process to be over with, so I told them I was okay and just tolerated it. (I am not saying all of this to scare any of you or make you worry; I just want to prepare you in case your experience is similar to mine.) After going to the radiology dept. everything else is very easy. They started an IV and the procedure began after reviewing and signing consent forms. The only advice I would give to you about this part is to review carefully before signing.. One of my consents for surgery was wrong. I refused to sign it until the surgeon came by and we amended it. Discharge instructions: Come for follow up and result findings on Sept. 10. No lifting/pulling/dragging or carrying items. No driving until Thursday a.m. Can shower tomorrow. Call surgeons office for any concerns. Take Motrin or Advil for pain. I was given a narcotic Rx. Vicodin, but the doctor advised me only to use it very sparingly, as the side effects can be severe. The dressing I have upon discharge is a Tegasorb. He said you don't need to worry about it getting wet. The nurse said that if you are afraid to get it wet, you can do sponge baths until the return appointment. I feel so much better now",

It is really helpful to know that I am not so alone and that there are others having surgery besides me. I think right now, the main thing that I am trying to get through is the anxiety. I believe that once I get the pathology report from the surgery that I will be less anxious. Right now my biggest fear is \"What if I have more cancer than the biopsy has shown?\" I am very confident in my surgeon and his plans for me. Just playing the waiting game for now...",

I know what you mean about people saying weird things, that has happened somewhat in my situation as well. I think that people mean well, but don't know how to help or what to say to someone in our situation. I have not told that many people about it. I truly think that everything happens for a reason, and for some reason, this is what we have been given to deal with. I am not sure why, except maybe it serves as some kind of test to see how strong we are or what we can teach others about it. I am just trying to stay as positive as I can until the procedure is over and then I get to play the waiting game some more, as I wait on test results. Try to do something fun for yourself this weekend and rest when/if you can. I plan to do the same. Take care.",

No fever, increased redness or other symptoms, just looked weird and the bubble was itchy. He says that he believes it is an allergy to the glue type adhesive used in the dressing. It hurts when I wear a bra, so he advised me not to until my appt. on the 10th. My incision lines are in a weird place, from directly under the nipple to the edge of the breast going downward. Hope everyone gets to enjoy their weekend. Thinking of you and sending lots of positive energy.",

The nurse navigator said that I should put all of this out of my mind and try to keep busy. The thing I have discovered since May, when I thought I was just having a routine mammogram and that it is no big deal, is that keeping busy is very hard work everyday. It is hard not to let your mind wander and focus too much on the breast cancer. To the rest of you, I hope that you are having a wonderful evening relaxing with friends or family.

He said that my incision site is looking as it should. The pathology report shows that of six tissue samples obtained, five came back with negative margins and the other one came back with positive margins. The next step is to have a re-excision, but I can't have it done for awhile, because I am still healing from the lumpectomy. I have a follow up appointment with the surgeon on 11/5 and then the re-excision is scheduled for 11/19 (my son's birthday). So this will postpone the start of my radiation. Instead of my radiation being in October as originally planned, it will start in mid December.",
