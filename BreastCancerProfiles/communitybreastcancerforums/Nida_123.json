I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to talk about this but I dont know who or how to communicate my concerns to. I have been experiencing some symptoms which I'm not sure would require medical medical attention no, and quite frankly I wouldn't know how to seek help. I have noticed that there are sometimes lumps on the areola as well as skin dimpling over there, but what really concerned me was how one of my nipples tend to invert sometimes. Anyways I know that I may be younger than the average person to be diagnosed which is why I'm even more scared and I know that this forum is not to be diagnosing others but I'm not sure what to do and would love for others who have possibly been in this position to share some advice.
