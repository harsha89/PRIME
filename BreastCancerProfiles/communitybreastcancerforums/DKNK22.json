She joked and told me not to let my husband bite my boob for a while. She made me feel like a hypochondriac. a few months later when the breast grew my husband got freaked out so I went to a breast surgeon, who also told me it's probably nothing & she wouldn't even prescribe antibiotics for it, but at least she sent me for a sono/mamo, which led to a biop...etc. I can't imagine how many other diagnosis that first doctor missed. Hope she chokes on her retirement! ",
