The worse part of the whole thing were the drain tubes they put under my arm.  They were so uncomfortable.  They didn't really hurt, just a pain in the butt!  I was thankful to have them removed last week. Having a small pillow to put under my arm really helped me to feel more comfortable.  My surgery was 4 weeks ago and I am feeling great.  I am excited to head off to work  today just to get out of the house and have something to do! I'm glad to hear your chemo was not so horrible.  I hope I have the same experience. ",
