I refuse to think that I will be repeating what  I went through from last March through radiation ending in September. At least my surgeon has'nt called. Our trip to Savannah has been postponed until after my oncologist appointment next week. We keep on keeping on I guess.",

He said the abnormality was probably related to the surgery and and a repeated  mammo in 6 months is recommended to better document stability.Bone density test results were great. My next hurdle starts tomorrow- my \"Quit Smoke\" date. Had my reports been bad today I would have not quit. That quit smoking forum is going to be busy ! Thanks for your prayers and support !   Jane",

My first mammogram(9 months after surgery) is scheduled for tomorrow and I am extremely concerned about it. My primary concern is what it might reveal and second is the pain which I have never feared before in yearly mammograms. Any words of comfort or wisdom?",

I just turned 70,DH has early stage Alzheimers which limits his understanding of what is happening to me and I have to be careful not to upset him,our 3 adult daughers have only heard the positives. Yet with 1 regular rad and 5 boosts remaining my energy is returning. At the height of my fatigue I developed a severe sinus infection which is now much better. In looking back it seems the 3rd week of rads was the worst. Hopefully you will soon recognize a turning point. Live for the day,look for the positive,try to continue your regular activities,rejoice in anything you can accomplish even when tired.",

The distraction - or the main event for the day- is a Toro riding lawnmower bought yesterday and wouldn't start today. My normally mechanical husband' who suffers from early stage Alzheimer was of no help, After studying the manuals I called the dealership . They could not get it started and hauled it back to the shop. Problems like these keeps one from dwelling on BC and looking forward to life as usual. The near future is a trip to Savannah in our motor-home.  Jane (the x-golfer)",
