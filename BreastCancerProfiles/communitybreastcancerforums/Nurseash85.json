I just turned 27 a few days after all my trouble began and it seems surreal to be seeing a surgeon and having all of these tests done. I knew one day I would have to worry about this. Just didnt think it would be now. I hope you have your family nearby for support. You will be in my thoughts and prayers. ",

I will look into Orlando.  Does anyone know if papillomas can cause a stabbing intermittent pain? I could not find this anywhere. Maybe this is just normal, but recall always having this.  Jenn333 Did you feel a lump with the indentation? My gyno is pointed it (indentation) out to me. When I tried showing it to the surgeon, he ignored me. He did not even exam me. He squeezed my nipple to make the blood come out. It wouldnt come out so he said there was nothing that could be done becuase the only way to find the duct was by the bloody discharge. He was telling me to come back in two weeks when I felt wetness on the nipple, the blood came out. Then he said that was the duct he would remove.   AKC  you said your symptoms never went away, what were your symptoms? That is silly to me too. According to research atypical papillomas can't get a definitive dx until they are sent for pathology. In some studies, up to 38% of cases were upgraded (this was the biggest sample size I could find). That is the exact reason why I think an MRI should be done. Please let me know your MRI results.   Thanks you for all of the advice. I am hoping to get some answers soon. Everyone is so supportive and understanding on here. I have never had to actaully be a patient before and it is very hard for me. Today, I almost second guessed my self. I spoke to the original surgeon's nurse. She said it was rare for someone my age to be diagnosed with breast cancer and what I had was common and MRIs are not usually done. I was calling to see how much time I needed to get off of work and she said I could go back to work the next day becasue it was only a minor procedure. I then asked if I would be given only local anesthesia and benzo and she laughed at me and replied \"No hun, you will get general anesthesia.\" So, obviously the nurse is incompetent too. You can not drive or make decisions for at least 24-48 hours after general anesthesia and should have a responsible adult with you for the first 24 hours which is for moderate sedation and not deep sedation (General anesthesia). Lost all trust in them and will not go back.  I may worry more because of my medical background/knowledge as a nurse. But my grandmother also passed away in her 30s due to breast cancer. I also have a friend who got their dx in their 20s. Her biggest problem before dx was shoulder pain, which I have been having this horrible pain in my shoulder for the last month or so. She said she is worried about my shoulder pain more than anything else.  I have never been sick and I dont fret over my health. I have just had this uneasy feeling for the last 6 months now. I never visit my doctor unless its routine, however, I have now seen my gyno 5 times for miscillaneous breast pain, lumps, and bloodwork. When the blood came out of my nipple I felt like the light went off and then my uneasy feeling only got worse. ",

She is sending me for a second opinion. I just want to know. Getting the runaround is driving me crazy! I am so sick of healthcare...and I'm a nurse. I do the same for my patients everyday. Its more frustrating now that I have to advocate for myself. Blessings20 did your discharge get sent for cytology? Was there a lump?",

      "Content": "Nurseash85 wrote: My pathology from the bloody nipple discharge came back with atypial papilloma cells so my doctor sent me to a surgeon. My ultrasound and mammogram were both negative but I am 27 years old. The general sugeon wants to do excisional biospy and ductecomy. He isnt even going to order more tests like an MRI. I am confused, why? Wouldn't he want to know if there were multiple papillomas? And if there was only one or multiple? Should I see someone else besides a general surgeon? Are there specialists for the breast? My breasts are already very lumpy, but there aren't any nodules behind the nipple. I thought the nodules behind the nipple were the ones that caused bleeding and also less likely to be cancerous. This is all so confusing. Every research study says something different and every doctor sas something differnt. Should I see another doctor? I want all of the abnormal cells gone. If he is going into to only the bleeding duct then he will he know if there werent more papillomas? Also, in my breast exam I had an indentation in the left lower breast. Is this concerning???  Log in to post a reply",
