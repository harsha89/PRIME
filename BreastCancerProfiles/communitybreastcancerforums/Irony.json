I actually found my own cancer. Locating the clip under ultrasound can be really challenging. The clip is very small. If the mass is no longer visible, it can make finding the clip really difficult. The clip is best seen under mammography, so I'm not sure why they didn't do the mammo unless the cancer was very lateral or medial and difficult to obtain an image. If they are doing a lumpectomy, they will usually use mammography to localize the clip before surgery. If she is having a mastectomy, then all the tissue will be looked at. The tissue that is removed will be sent to radiology while your wife is in surgery to be x-rayed. The clip will show up in the tissue that has been removed I hope this helps. Regards, Marie",

I know it is terrible, but it will get better.",

They were unable to locate my sentinel node (probably due to previous left reduction surgery). No axillary nodes were tested. Tamoxifen was not recommended due to prior history of deep vein thrombosis. I get anxious because they couldn't find the sentinel node, but my tumor was small and not aggressive. Tamoxifen would carry more risk than benefit in my situation.",

Then a few days before surgery I went in and they numbed me and injected a RADIO FREQUENCY marker called a Savi Scout. It was not radioactive. The way it works is that the day of the surgery, instead of having to do a traditional wire localization where you would go to the radiology dept and they would place a wire into the mass that sticks out of the breast so the surgeon can locate the titanium clip, they will use this wand that will pick up the radio frequency marker they put in. You avoid having the wire localization that can be stressful and painful. It worked like a charm for me. If this is similar to what you are having, it is great. I am a breast ultrasound tech and have assisted many wire localizations. You get to avoid that! I love advances in technology. Just verify with your doctor whether it is radioactive or radiofrequency. Best of luck.",

The have no greater chance of becoming cancer than any other area In your breast. Fibroadenoma are commonly multiple and bilateral. It is simply not realistic to remove every biopsied fibroadenoma. In our practice, we recommend removal if it is greater than 3 cm or if it grows within a short period of time (6 months). That being said, you have to sleep at night, so if you can find a Surgeon to remove it and you really want it out, then you should do that. I've been doing breast ultrasound for 17 years. I have seen many that have grown, but none that have become cancerous. Hope this helps.",
