For the fitness \"freaks\" out there, it took me 1.5 years post mx to get back to lifting weights.  It feels good; but I just cannot lift more than the 3 lb weights or it causes too much pain in my joints.  Took Arimidex for 11 doses only.  I used to do same exercises with 10 lb weights.  I'm so worried about the lymphedema issue that I'm thinking about cutting back to 2 lb weights... Life goes on.",
