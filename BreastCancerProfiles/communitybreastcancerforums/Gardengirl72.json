Had a Core Needle Biopsy on Dec. 18th after a Mammagram and Ultrasound detected microcalcifications. Just got off the phone with the nurse at the Breast Clinic and it's confirmed as an Atypia. Scheduled to see the breast surgeon this Thursday to schedule removal. I'm only 43 with extremely dense breasts but no history of BC in immidate family. Will find out if Dr wants me to go on Tamoxifen. Nurse did mention that there is a possibility that there could be BCIS hiding in the Atypia, but slight (still makes me nervous). Any advice on ways to stay positive and stress free? This is all still sinking in for me. Thanks.
