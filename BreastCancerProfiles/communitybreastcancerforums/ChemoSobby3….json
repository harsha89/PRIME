I decided to have a double mastectomy at age 38.  I was known for my big boobs -- but I was willing to let them go for my own sanity.  So, I just completed chemo and reconstruction and will have the exchange surgery this Thursday.  Your posting scares me because I have a lump on the left FOOB breast and the PS and ONC says it's the corner of the expander.  But I worry.  Then I saw this posting and it broke my heart. Please know that my heart goes out to you ... and if this is another cancer -- know that you've done this twice and you can do it again.  You will crumble, curse, cry and be in utter dispair -- we're entitled -- but when you're done stand up and fight.  It's as simple as that.",

I love my doc, but he doesn't understand the angst that comes after the chemo and reconstruction is over.  I use sleeping pills to sleep otherwise, my mind would go all night about minutia things or death or simply because I hurt too much to sleep - especially in my collarbone, shoulders, hips and knees.  What else could hurt you might ask???  How about the three joints in every finger.  URGH!  I called their office in tears and wanted to take a medical leave from work for a year because I couldn't handle the stress of work and the pain.  They are more than happy to do so and have wondered why I haven't requested that earlier -- but in addition to helping me with this my ONC wants me to see a shrink that can medicate me!  Really?  Part of the problem is that i pop so many pills on a daily basis and I should take more???? Anyway, I could go on and on ... but I am glad this forum was opened because sometimes I feel like because it was stage I it wasn't so bad -- as someone at work stupidly said to me.   ",
