Long story short, was breast cancer, so far just in right breast.  Had neoadjuvant chemo, 8 rounds, including doing a clinical trial adding Avastin.  Tumor (ductal) started out at 3.7cm.  Pre-surgical MRI showed 'no remaining tumor'.  Surgery found positive sential node, so at lumpectomy time also had axillary surgery, removing another 19 nodes (all but sentinel were clean).  Post-surgical pathology report showed tumor at time of surgery, after chemo, was not gone, but was still 3.5cm and has 'lobular features'.  Three weeks later found out I had a bad margin and 2 of 3 docs recommended nipple/aereola excision, other recommended mastectomy.  Then, today found out I actually had 2 bad margins.  Now all docs recommending mastectomy on right breast.  Tomorrow go in for genetic testing for BRCA1 and 2 and if positive docs will recommend bilateral instead.  LOTS of things up in the air.  Somewhat 'upsetting' day as chemo didn't appear to work too well and every time I get phone call, meet docs seems like bad news, but I love docs and trust their hard work and appreciate their honesty.  Scared about bilateral (of course) but okay with it... glad to read so much encouraging stuff.  Still chance of cancer after bilateral though???  I read if there's any tissue left it's susceptible to further cancer????  Thoughts??  cyber hugs???  Also am wondering about time in hospital, what post-op is like, length of having drains in....",
