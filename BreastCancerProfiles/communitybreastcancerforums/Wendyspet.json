My stomach was hungry, but my mouth wanted to spit it out!  so weird.  I could taste lemon flavor (costco has these little lemon bites), and salt.  Other than that--nothing.  So I ate alot of salty noodles.  I fluctuated 5-7 pounds over my usual weight, and still have some. The taste bothered me more than losing my hair.   ",

Yes, I do miss my nipples, but my tumor was very close to one so that one would have been gone anyways.  And I did have multi-focal areas of DCIS in the cancerous breast, (found with the BMX path)--so I would have been repeating the lumpectomies many times over.  I have been really lucky/blessed throughout out this: chemo wasn't bad (just finished); and since I already had implants, they just swapped them out for new ones during the BMX.  I still have to have my nipples done. I think that Sarah and I may be in the minority.  I get the impression that there are more women who choose lumpectomies over BMX.  I have to admit I started second-guessing my decision before my surgery.  All my doctors questioned me, but left the decision up to me.  Sarah brings up a good point though--age should make a difference.  It probably would be preferable to keep your breasts if you are younger like she was.  But I am 47.  Good luck to you.",

My IDC was close to the nipple and the bs said I might lose it anyway.  I figured I wanted them to match (and I wasn't up for the watch-and-wait process), so I had both done.  I didn't find the recovery very painful at all.  I was back to work 12 days after my double MX, but if I had anything other than a desk job, I would have stayed home longer. Best of luck on all your tests.  Don't plan much for yourself--all the doctor's visits/tests/hurry-up-and-wait sure is tiring.",

Please also remember that 80% of lumps are benign.  Most of the people you will meet here are in the 20%, so keep that in mind.  Best of luck.  ",

Have your sister ask for anxiety/sleep/depression medicine.  Maybe she might not want to take it, but its nice knowing that its in the house if needed. Also, during recovery and chemo I very much appreciated my family & friends bringing over food--even though I didn't ask for it.  It was nice to have leftovers in the fridge to munch on.  The steroids made me hungry almost all the time. You sound like a good sister.  I hope she is talking to you about her feelings.  (sometimes husbands just don't get it--they want to \"fix\" everything.)  I would give almost anything to have my sister with me now, but she passed from melanoma in 2010.  She wouldn't talk about her fears at the time, she very much tried to run away from it all.  But I can't beat myself up for that--that's just the way she was.  Good luck to both you and your sister.",
