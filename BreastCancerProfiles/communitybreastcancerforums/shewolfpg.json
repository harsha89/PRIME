I am only 35 and the stress of finding this one was too much to handle. I decided I want to fight this as quick and as mean as possible. I wanted a double Masectomy even if only the one side was involved.  My chemo doc told me 4 weeks after surgery I will start chemo and I will still have radiation. My tumor also grew since ultrasound biopsy to the MRI a week later. I swear I feel it growing as well. I have pain with my cancer as well as lymphnode pain. My surgeon did try to talk me into a lumpectomy at first but once my receptors came back realized that this can be a huge bitch. I also don't think I could just do the lumpectomy and worry every time I found any bump. I know that's how I would be. I don't think there is a right or wrong. It is all up to you. ",

Hubby just retired from 20 years in the Air Force and we retired from Germany and really I am just getting used to the San Antonio area.  We are just trying to get used to bills that we haven't had in years and used to how things are here. I had been overseas for the last 7 years that it is tough.  Now this stress too!  I mean really can't I catch a break.  I was already having so many problems with stuff going wrong when we got here and now this.  He new boss is pretty cool though he still paid the hubby for the time he missed yesterday for my appointment.  And the hubby is so sweet he asked if it was okay if he went back to work which of course I told him yes please because we can't afford for him not to work.  My work has been pretty great as well even if my boss doesn't know everything that s going on yet.  I don't even know yet.  He just knows I was awaiting test results and the results SUCKED!  Okay here I am just blabbing again.  I miss having my friends around.  Haven't made any here yet and it sucks. ",

Weird how this Cancer Crap can bring things out in a person.  Also got a call from my bosses boss today. She wanted to check up on me. Not from and employer / employee but as a breast cancer survivor to well me. It really touched me. She also told me to save her cell phone and call her even if it was to have her come sit at my side.

      "Content": "shewolfpg wrote: Hi everyone!  Well I hate to say it but I am now part of this group.  And like another poster as said this is not meant in a bad way.  First off a little background.  Sometime right before my husbands official day of Military retirement which was the 1st of this month I found a lump on the left side of my left breast. That was on a Thursday before the 4th.  Well went to my regular doc who I was meeting for the first time and had her check.  <Normally when I go to the doc things seem to disappear like when I have a fever>. Well when I got there she found it right away.  Her first thought was it was a cyst. In fact she said she was 90% sure it wasn't cancer.  Cancer does not run in my family and I am on 35.  But she scheduled me a mammogram and ultrasound for the following Tuesday. Come Tuesday I go to the appointment by myself because I don't think it was going to be bad.  Well I get my mammogram for the first time and man do those hurt for large breasts.  They were able to see the lump and they marked it right away with those neat little BB pasty things.  Took the mammogram of both sides.  Definitely saw the one.  They then proceeded to take extra of both just to be proactive for the radiologist.  Then proceed to the special waiting room for us ladies waiting for them to review the mammogram and get the ultrasound room ready.  About a half hour later I was brought in.  I laid down and the scan went on.  I was able to see everything they were seeing.  Still hoping it is just a cyst or something simple like that.  Well guess what it was more than 3cm one way and more than 2cm the other.  There was also some blood flow into the tumor.  They then proceeded to look at the auxiliary lymphnode.  Which I had no idea they were going to look at.  That was more than 1cm in size with a thick something I cant remember right now.  Well that is when I get the look from the radiologist.  He said it wasn't good.  But did tell me most likely it was a fibro ademea.  They scheduled me for a biopsy for the 15th and results 10 days from then.  Now I was worried.  Saw the official report and I had a BIRADS 4 and some other stuff I can't remember right now. Now on to biopsy day.  Man that sucked but they took 6 samples from the lump. And 3 from the node.  Now the waiting really began Today I got the results.  As soon as the doc sat down and I saw his face I knew I was screwed.  He said he hated to be the one with the bad news.  And he did.  I had Invasive Ducal carcinoma with a grade 3 awaiting the rest of the results with left axillary positive for macrometastatic carcinoma.  After reading more of the report all 9 samples were FULL of carcinoma and over all grade of both were 3.  They are still awaiting staging and the receptor things.  They were awesome.  They already have an MRI scheduled for Saturday and a \"Breast clinic\" for Monday at noon.  That is when I will meet my whole team and I will know WAY more.  God this sucks and so does CANCER!     Dx 7/24/2014, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 1/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 8/5/2014 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left; Prophylactic mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 8/27/2014 AC Chemotherapy 10/22/2014 Taxol (paclitaxel) Radiation Therapy 1/5/2015 Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",
