You will see that many of us here have no family history or risk factors other that we were women and had breasts.  My Oncologist recommends the BRCA test for any woman under 50 to determine if it is indeed passed thru the family and the results can make a big difference in your treatment plan and options so be sure to ask for that based on your age.  I wish you well and never think that any question is a stupid one.  I did not even know there were different types of breast cancer before diagnosed.

Guess he could tell from the biopsy.  Just remember that at a birad 4 it is 80% likely to be B9.  So the odds are in your favor.  The waiting is so hard...the worst I would say.  We are here for you so let us know how we can help Maggie",
