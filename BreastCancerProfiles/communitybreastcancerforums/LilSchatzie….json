I have several friends that homeschool. I love working with my kids, but I don't think I'd be able to homeschool. As much as I lovey kids, I definately need me time to recharge my batteries..,lol Claire, that's cool your parents were stationed in Germany. My dad loved being there. I can't tell you how shocked his parents were when he took home a bride..lol. My mom big joke to my dad was if she waited a little longer she may have met Elvis. I think one of the bases he was stationed at was close to where my mom lived. I hope you got to make your potato pancakes ...sound good! Moira, I definately think this desease has made me focus on what's important...I really hope more and more of us get to live long enough to turn this shitty cancer into a true chronic condition or dare I say cure! Well thanks to all of checked out my answers. I picked the next persons and I will be posting her questions soon!!! Xoxo Karen",

      "Content": "Jan 28, 2013 08:31AM LilSchatzie wrote: Thanks for giving me the opportunity to share more about myself.    1. Why do you call yourself LilSchatzie? LilSchatzie is sort of special to me.  My mom was born in Mannheim Germany.  My Dad was Irish American and in the late 50\u2019s he was stationed in Germany.  My mom worked on the Army base.  She felt like she was a small town girl and she wanted to see the world.  My dad was a dreamer and wanted to show her the world.  So basically they married in Germany when she was 19.  My mom moved to America with my dad.  Growing up Schatzie or Schatz was what my parents called each other.  Not sure of the exact translation but I was told it sort of meant Honey or Sweetheart.  So in the mid 80\u2019s when I was a teenager, my parents got an email account.  My dad was allowed to have 5 email addresses under the account.  His was LuvSchatzie,  I couldn\u2019t think of anything so I used  LilSchatzie.  So now almost 30 years later I still go by LilSchatzie.  So if you ever see a LilSchatzie out their on the web its most likely me. 2. Tell us your favorites. Movie, food, color, actor, actress, music genre, tv show, singer or any other fav you have. It\u2019s funny that you ask me about my favorites.  Being a mom for the last 9 years, in certain ways I feel like I lost myself and everything was about them.  Since getting diagnoised I have tried to remember myself and put myself first and not make everything and every choice about the kids. Movie\u2026.I\u2019d say I\u2019m a sappy movie lover.  I really like those feel good movies with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  So I\u2019d say \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d, \u201cWhen you got mail\u201d, \u201cHope Floats\u201d and in the classic arena I\u2019d say I liked \u201cIt\u2019s A wonderful Life\u201d and \u201cGone with the wind\u201d.  Also, I must confess probably my least favorite movie, was \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d\u2026..those monkeys and witches scared the crap out of me as a kid and I sort of never got into it\u2026.But real scary movies I use to love. Food\u2026I\u2019d say  my kids would say I love Salad because I feel its what I eat most of the times when we go out to eat\u2026\u2026\u2026.But Cheesy\u2026.topped Nachos and a margarita\u2026\u2026would probably be my real favorite. I love all colors, depend on my mood.  Actors and Actresses, I\u2019d say I never really got into the having a favorite star as an adult\u2026.but as a kid John Stamos, John Schneider, Christopher Atkins, can\u2019t think of the others\u2026.but I loved Teen Beat and had plenty of posters on the walls. Music, I\u2019d say I love all music.  I can\u2019t carry a tone, but if I\u2019m in my car and a song that comes on that I can blast and sing along with\u2026I\u2019m in heaven.  Music  brings me right back to my youth.  Really calms my soul.  So happy my kids love music too. TV shows, I\u2019d say I like reality TV because It really doesn\u2019t matter if I miss it or not.  I like Big Brother, all the housewives, Amazing Race, Survivor, etc.   I\u2019m not the type that starts talking about it and thinks its real.  I just watch it to take my out of my own crap.   The other shows I watch would be Greys Anatomy, Parenthood, Big Bang Theory\u2026.and with my kids we just got into \u201cGood Luck Charlie\u201d.  I also like  documentaries, and history channel.  I love learning new stuff. Inspiration of the moment is people like Kris Carr and David Shevell\u2026.(I can\u2019t think of his last name), but I like to read about people living possitively with cancer. 3. Tell us about your family and what they like to do for fun. So first I\u2019ll tell you about my family I grew up with.  I had the greatest parents and siblings.  I was the youngest of 5 kids.  The hardest part of being an adult for me is the losses I\u2019ve had in my family.  In 1990 my oldest brother died from an anerysim at 32.  It was a total shock to us.  At that time they didn\u2019t have the technology they have now, so they caught it when it was happening and he was on life support for a few weeks but was pronouced brain dead almost immediately.  He was single and my mom wanted to donate his organs, but us siblings were in such shook (He was 12 years older then me.) and we thought the doctors were wrong.  He looked perfect\u2026.we couldn\u2019t let the plug get pulled\u2026.we knew he just had to make it.  The moment he died,  my world was changed for ever.  On Christmas Eve 2002 my dad died at 66 from a long battle with Emphsema.  On March 15, 2008 my brother (my best friend) died from cirrhosis of the liver (I was 8 months pregnant with my little girl).  And just last year my last brother died from Thymus Cancer (He had been in remission and his cancer came back the same month I found out I was stage iv).   I now have just have my mom and my sister. As for my family\u2026.. I have a great husband.  He would do anything for me.  I have 3 wonderful kids.  9, 7 & 5.  They are happy and healthy and I couldn\u2019t ask for more when it comes to my kids.  We do lots for fun!  The kids love amusement parks and water parks so we try to get to as many of them as possible and just plan be silly.  I am also sort of active in my church.  With all I been through I think my faith is what gives me the support to keep going.  It gives me the connections to my family members that have passed.  I sort of want my kids to get my stregnth and feel the support of the church when I pass.   Putting my particular religion aside,  I want them to feel like they can go to church or just about go any place and talk to me and feel I\u2019m there with them when they need me in the future when I\u2019m not here.  I also live in the north east area where we have lots of national landmarks and things that we try to get the kids to.  Now that they are getting bigger and I think the older one will appreciate it I want to try to get to landmarks in the south, midwest, and west coast.  Also want to get them to Germany to meet family and I would love to get them to Rome. 4. Describe your city/town. Would you want to live anywhere else? Have you lived anywhere else? I live in a large town in NJ.  I love it because it has everything close by.   I\u2019m definitely not a country girl.  I\u2019d love to go see it and spend some time there and get to know it, but I\u2019m a city girl at heart.  I lived the first 32 years of my life in Brooklyn NY and New York City.  I loved the whole city life\u2026.\u201dsex in the city\u201d decade for me.   I didn\u2019t get married until after 30 so I had lots of fun in my twenties.  I worked a job that I traveled a lot and I would see many things.  I did beach houses with friends.  I also did a semester abroad in college and I just loved traveling Europe.  So much fun traveling with friends and staying in hostels.  When I was younger I really wanted to move to the west coast.  My mom discouraged it, she said that I\u2019d miss family and that once you move its hard to go back and find your home\u2026.can\u2019t remember exactly how she said it\u2026.but she encouraged traveling and seeing things\u2026.but not actually moving.   I winded having to move out of the city into the suburbs because of my husbands work, but I\u2019m happy still being close to all I grew up with and feels familier. 5. What are your hobbies? Do you collect anything? Honestly, at this point in my life I\u2019d say my kids are my hobby.  Other than fighting breast cancer and doing and learning everything I can to possibly stick around to see them grow up.  Everything I do and want to do is for them.  I taught them to read with Hooked on Phonics.  I love that they will all (still working with my daughter) know I taught them to read.  Our big thing now is family game night.  I taught my oldest how to play chess, can\u2019t wait to teach the others.  I love to take them out for hikes and walks in nature.  I know I may not have long with them, so I try to be with them for everything.  I sing in church (I can\u2019t sing, but I want them to remember that in mass when they sing Gloria or Alleluia in the catholic mass I sang.)  I also try to teach them its ok to be silly.  I have a laugh that I can play up that will make them laugh for hours.  I\u2019m a stay at home mom so I try to always consider I\u2019m raising adults.  I try to be their for as much as possible, but I also try to give them wings and watch from the side lines to see them fly. As for collections I use to collect things, but now I try not to collect to much.  I\u2019ve saw with all the people I love who passed that when they pass, others don\u2019t treasure those collections the way they did.  It\u2019s so hard to get rid of things that a love one treasured.  So I\u2019d say at this point I don\u2019t really have a collections. Well thanks for giving me the chance to share.  I need to think who I want to ask next. Xoxo Karen",

They noticed his blood work wasn't bouncing back to get his final treatment. They did more test and discovered he relapsed. Then he had to start treatment all over again. They were unable to get him in remission. Now this trial is his only hope. If the trial doesn't work they really don't have much for him. Cancer just sucks!!!

My October pet scan didn't pick up the lung mets and showed a reduction in the size of auxiliary node. It's a great drug start with. As far as side effects go, I really didn't have any other then hot flashes and stiff joints. I find taking the tamoxifen at night it helped with the flashes. As far as the stiff joints, exercise really helps with that.",

In the beginning it is hard to get your head around it, but it gets easier. What works for me is I gathered myself a medical team I trust. I also try to live in the moment with my children making memories and trying to set up routines with them so that if my health changes, they have the security of those routines. in the beginning I shared everything with my friends, as I move further along I now only share with my friends what they need to know. So far I've been on a hormonal, a vaccine trial and now Xeloda....if you met me on the street you wouldn't even know I had cancer. For the most part I like it that way. When I freak out with scans or treatments I come to these boards or other stage iv support systems I set up over the last year and a half. These ladies are great and don't fret, there is plenty of love and hope out there for us. Xoxo Karen",

She started her career dancing and it never went anywhere. She is living a dream. Also many of her interviews she does a great job correcting misquotes. She is very clearly telling everyone that she is not in remission, but she still has a life worth living. Just like all of us. I think her message is very clear! I did see somewhere she has an interview that's going to air on Thursdsy @ 10 on one of the major networks. (Honestly I was in tears for Jack Osborne.

I really want to be there for them. What helps me get through it is my life experiences and by living in the moment. I have friends that have lost their parents young and they turned out to be great adults. I know it sucks that I won't see all the milestones, but it helps me to think they can turn ok like some of my friends. I try to live in the moment and because right now I feel ok I try to keep their lives as normal as possible. The other day I turned 43 and I thought to myself I want to make 50 so bad. If I can get my little one to at least 10....I can set another goal...to get her to 15. It's such a scary journey, but my current motto is \"why not me\". As long as I keep hearing stories of long term survivors.....\"why not me!\"........\"why not you!\"......\"why not all of us!\".......something may switch the switch and many of us could be love survivors.....why not!!!

My kids were 7, 5 & 3. I spoke to lots of people regarding talking to the kids. I was told that I should tell them I have cancer and use real words. What they can imagine on their own is much worse then what I can say to them. Also it makes them secure (even if it's bad news) that they hear it first from a parent or a caregiver. I've never said i will die from the cancer. I was told not to plant thoughts in their heads, however i should try to answer their questions as they come up honestly. For example yes people can die from cancer, but my doctors are treating me and doing everything to keep me healthy. So i have been honest with the kids, but Overwhelmingly I was told to follow my heart and do what I think is best for my children",

Like many of you i was all set to have a mastectomy and because they found the lung mets my surgery was canceled. Last week I had a PET exam and yesterday reviewed results with doctor. I should be excited that my lungs show no evidence of disease, but i'm really not happy. The report shows only slite improvement in the breast and lymph nodes when compared with last PET. Its possible that the month i went getting the lung biopsy my grade 3 cancer grew aggressively so cimparing this one to that one isn't a true picture of 3 months of treatment. Well yesterday i told my friends my news about my lungs being ned on the scan, but didn't really get into the breast cancer and they are so happy for me, but i sort of feel numb. Not sad, but not happy either. But i think what pushed to post is this morning i looked at my lab results and both my tumor cancer markers they check went up. I'm not to worried about the markers because the one is 29 and the other one is 5 so I know they aren't that high and are greatly debated....but it still didn't help my mood today. On possitive note doctor said i could probably get a bmx and next week going to john hopkins to get on the vacine trial. Ok...now i feel a little better.

The clinical trial coordinator did most of the leg work with insurance company. All trials may work differently, but how mine worked was the trial paid for all the meds and treatments and blood draws that we're unique to the trial. My insurance was billed for all the scans and test that were standard for a stage iv cancer patient. Who would pay for what was worked out before the trial started. Michele, I totally believe in clinical trials. Of corse you need to do your own research and make sure it's safe and worth it for yourself. Many long term survivors I have met that have had all types of cancers have done very well with clinical trials with very little side effects. At your stage, I would definately consider phase ii trials because their is usually a limited time in our journey when we are eligible. Phase I trials are usually more of a risk that can usually be taken once you use up more standard treatment! Good luck!!! We are all routing for you! Xo Karen",

Thanks to anyone that has participated in a vaccine trial, I think it's important in getting the science to find a cure for us and our children. Anyone that is considering a vaccine trial don't be discouraged by mixed results. All treatments have mixed results, there is no silver bullet out there at this point. I think the earlier in your treatment you try one the better. There is really a lot of science out there that says even if you progress on the vaccine it's still in your system and may help your next treatments. Good luck to all!!",

I did get a lot from seeing the women stand up that were 10, 15, 20, etc. metastatic thrivers. Also it was encouraging to see all the beautiful metestatic women walking around with metastatic disease and know your not the only one. I guess what was most disappointing for me was that I showed up by myself running a little late and I sort of felt a clicky vibe. I didn't feel guided in a place to sit, I wasn't sure who came as a group and who were meeting there for the first time. Also some responses in the audience to the presenters were started as myself and others in my situation feel a certain way. Even though sometimes I agreed it made me feel like their was a group of people talking and making opinions that I didn't know about. In away it made me feel like I was in high school and didn't have a click. I really didn't mind not having a click because I'm not a click person but I really would have loved to meet some people, but I really would of had to put myself out there for that to happy and I guess I wasn't in the mood.",

As a parent, I think it's great to put these questions out there to see what others do. Over the last year I have learned so much from others on these boards. I try to be honest with my kids, give them opportunities to ask questions....also we use a lot of humor. So if my child ask a question like are you going to die....I would say something like \"everyone dies eventually\" and sort of make a joke about question I wonder what it would look like to live to 200 years old. My big message to my kids is, even if I am sad that I have cancer I'm not afraid and I (or should I say we (my husband) are there for them to answer any questions they have. I also push the message that as a family we live in the moment and don't worry about the future. I know my to older boys get that message. Last week my 8 & 6 year old needed to wear sneakers (yeah I'm from NY) so my 6 year old had had Velcro ties but my 8 year old had tie shoelaces and he had not worn tie shoes all Summer and he forgot how to tie. So I had to tie his shoes and I was lecturing him on what's he going to do next week when he is at camp? Then my 6 year old chimed into his defense and said \"Mom, let's worry about today. Let's not start worry about next week today. Lol I have to tell you it almost made me cry. They totally get my message of living in the moment \". So I'm not sure if I made any point with my rambling post. I just want you to know, you are the parent and you know your child...follow your instincts. Nobody knows what's better for your child then you. It's great to get ideas from others, but only apply what you think will be of benefit to your child. Xoxo Karen",
