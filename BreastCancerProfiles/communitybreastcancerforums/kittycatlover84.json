I received the results over the phone and will meet with the doctor tomorrow. However, I would like to ultimately be treated by someone that specializes in IBC am reaching out to ask if anyone can recommend a IBC expert in NYC. I would prefer to be treated in a cancer center. Of course Slaon Kettering was my first thought but I am having a hard time figuring out if there is anyone there that specializes in IBC. I am looking at the Dana-Farber Breast Cancer program. Does anyone have any thoughts? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
