I am so relieved that I have been crying off and on all day. It has been a long six months between diagnosis and this treatment. I'm glad to have that stage behind me. This board has been very helpful for me. Thank you!",

I did not think I'd feel so crappy after one treatment. I also have a double inner ear infection at the moment so I'm hoping that had a lot to do with it too. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else felt a little nauseous afterwards? Thanks for the support.",

TallinTerrific thank you for posting that picture. Those grandbabies are so beautiful! To answer a few of the other posts... I am working through Rads however I'm working from home more. The fatigue hit me like a ton of bricks for my first few treatments and then evened out a bit. I can already feel it from this morning's treatment though and yes it's not the same as being tired. I feel like someone plugged me in and is draining the energy from me. I have a rash with blisters on the top of my chest. The RO nurse gave me some 1% hydrocortisone cream. I'm also using Jean's Cream on my skin. Has anyone used this? Thoughts? I also now have the worst heartburn and subsequently have canker sores. Regardless of what I eat, the heartburn flares up. I am going to speak to the RO at my appointment with him on Wednesday. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. I have 12 more sessions to go!",

I was diagnosed at the end of October and just had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy done two weeks ago. I start rads in January. I have my first appointments with the MO and RO next week, so I'm sure I will have more details then. I just started back to work yesterday after being off for the surgery. I'm still a little sore and fatigued. This whole experience has been overwhelming. I am in a good position, but it's not like I was diagnosed with a cold. Is there a published list of questions for the MO and the RO for these initial appointments? Is there anything I should make a point of discussing? Thank you! ",

The residual lumpiness in my breast after the lumpectomy is getting harder too. I am using Jean's Cream 3x day. I know I'm lucky that I'm not sitting in a chair with an IV of chemo, but radiation is more intense than I thought it would be. All in all things are going well and will be over sooner than I think.
