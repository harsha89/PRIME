Be careful of too much salt and not enough movement. If you are in pain please tell the Dr or a nice nurse .  Don't just suffer , they might not realize that you are having a problem.  hard to say if its lympadema or not.  I can say when its very swollen and painful you kind of know , but I've been told sometimes after surgery that happens but then goes away. Sushanna's idea of the pillows is great , and I've just tried some very gentle massage and found that and a warm shower helped me . We are all different though.  Please read through the threads and you will learn alot here and get lots of support. hang in there , It will be o.k.  ; ) E",

      "Content": "Oct 27, 2013 06:51PM - edited Oct 27, 2013 06:52PM by naturelover Hi Barb, I just got the news that I had mets to lungs September 28th. I had just had all my scans and thought they were good when my onc told me I had fluid around my lungs. I had to have that horrible fluid drained off my left lung and then they sent it to pathology. Well, that was very hard to hear that the original cancer cells in my breast had gone to my bones and now to my lungs. He put me on Xeloda for 14/7 and it was very tough. I had jaw spasms that went to my left shoulder, back and then my chest. I had 3 episodes like this but the cardiologist gave me nitroglycerine tabs and for 2/3 I had those that stopped the pain. Onc took me off X and now on combo of Faslodex and Arimedex. He wanted to give my body a rest from the chemo until he could talk to cardiologist. Enough about my issues. Somehow we have to find a way to not think about this disease that starts with a small letter c (at least in my book). I am fighting it as I'm sure you are too. I will pray that the new meds work for you. I don't mind admitting that I wouldn't make it some days w/o prayers going up for me. Talk soon I hope! Judy",

My grandbabies had a terrible virus and we suspect that they got it at a fast-food play land-- no proof, of course, but it seems as though that's the culprit! The last two times they've had to go to the doctor and miss about 4 days of school. They won't be going again. Has anyone else ever had this happen? I'm so glad that we are all able to enjoy our children and grandchildren (for those of us who are old enough). The special events in our children's lives are what make our days happy even when we are sick or tired from our meds, etc. I love hearing all about them too! Judy",

I try though; I do accomplish very little. Currently, I had a very bad mouth sore on my lips; it's so painful I can barely eat or drink. I see my onc tomorrow and hope he can give me something for it. I am on A/A 5 mg. I was on 10 mg. and had to have my dosage of Affinitor cut back. I hope I can stay on it. My CA 27/29 was 200 last month. I hope I get better news tomorrow. I keep up with everyone on here and so glad that there are wonderful times with children and grandchildren happening!! That is what life is all about--being with our loved ones and finding joy in each day! Take care!! Judy",

Brenda, I wouldn't have liked them talking as if I wasn't there either. One more thing about the procedure--I felt such relief during and after that I would do it again if I have to.

You all described exactly how I've been feeling. I can only do one or two things and then I kick back on the love seat in my family room. I love to watch Masterpiece Classics and I am a news junkie too! My mother lives with me and insists that I rest when I lose my breath. I know she worries about me--that's nothing new--I always worry about her falling, etc. It's great  that we can live together. Well, I go back to my doctor in about two weeks and I am very curious as to what he will say about the SOB getting worse. I had a good checkup last visit but my CA 27-29 was a little higher than usual. It is what it is I guess. One thing I'm learning with this disease is to enjoy the moment, the day and not try to think to far ahead. Keep me posted please. I read this at least every third day. I always hope and pray that every one is resting comfortably at night and during the day finding pleasures in the simple things--as Glenna said--spending time with a grandchild or having a glass of wine. I will add that as a Southerner, I really enjoy my glass of sweet iced tea w lemon in the spring and summer. I love being outdoors in the sunshine and watching the birds. Goodnight and sleep well all!! Judy ",

He then said that I didn't need the pulmonologist since my diagnosis was lungs mets. I totally trust my onc and would look for another one if I had any doubts about my treatment. I was diagnosed with IBC (Inflammatory breast cancer) in 2005. I had a 51% chance to survive 5 yrs. I will soon figure out how to update my info to show my journey until the present. Mine spread to my bones in 2011. After being on Arimidex for 6 yrs., it stopped working and I lost 32 pounds. I was on Tamoxifen for 13 mos. Then this past September I had CT scan and bone scan and there was fluid in my pleural cavity. I had a hacking cough that was so bad I would vomit and the wheezing was so bad (I was a runner) that I had to use an inhaler frequently. My onc put me on Xeloda for 14/7 schedule; had to stop it after one cycle and now on the combo. I don't know if I've helped you at all. I hope so, maybe a little. I have a cousin that saw a pulmonologist first and then somehow she ended up w the onc last. She dropped the pulmonologist after she saw the onc because she has small cell lung cancer. I was so anxious for her to see a oncologist asap. Good luck w whatever you decide!",

I am concerned that it seems so far away (not distance, time)! They live in Dallas but are getting married within 30 miles of where I live. I live in a rural area a few miles from Oak Island, NC!  Brenda: I am excited about your son's graduation--from law school??? That is awesome! I remember the day that my only daughter graduated from Pharmacy School--I was ecstatic! She is a true blessing from God as well as my two sons! Carol and Jean: Thanks for your comments, as well!! To All: Especially (Glenna): I take a Benadryl (25 mg.) right before bedtime and 1 Ibuprofen. I prop my head up on 2 pillows and sleep in a chilly room with my ceiling fan on low! I read until I fall asleep and nothing wakes me up--not even my dog or the coffee grinder! I guess I have always been a very sound sleeper! I don't know if your onc will agree with this or not but I know it helps me and my daughter suggested the Benadryl. Before I forget, it works for me because I'm 66--it doesn't have the same effect on young adults, etc. Latest news from my wonderful onc: My CA 27/29 was up to 200 and last month it was 180. He wasn't happy and took me off Arimidex/Faslodex combo! He told me we could start Taxol; I would have to have a portacath (sp??) put in and I dread it so much! Then he said that I could do the Aromasin/Affinitor combo and that's what we decided to do! I am on my 4th day and it's too early to have the dreaded SE's. I plan to save the Taxol as a last resort! I have been so fortunate to have had some of the hormonal drugs that helped keep my marker down! I am ER positive; IBC type. Lately, one of my favorite things to do is go to my bedroom and look out at the beautiful trees and sunshine! I have a lot of birds and enjoy hearing them sing! My mother and Cassie were saying last night that they think it's strange that I love to hear the wind, thunderstorms and rain pounding on the roof! I guess that is a little bit crazy but that's me! I hope everyone had a wonderful Passover/Easter! Our weather was dreary--lots of pounding rain and gusty winds! Judy  ",
