Thinking about you other women and wishing you the best.",

I am so tight and sore in the chest and back and wasn't sent home with exercises or stretches to do, so not sure what to do or not to do.  I have been lounging in my pj's every day, but managed to walk around the yard today for 10 minutes.  It could be I'm not moving enough.  Tomorrow, I go back (4 hour drive) to the Drs. and should get my path report and I will be asking for post op instructions/exercises.  I will get some exercise then walking from the parking garage to the Drs. office. Hope to get all 6 drain tubes out tomorrow also.  The only support bra I can wear is the one they had me in after surgery.  All others are way to tight. I can get myself into bed to lay down, but can not get myself out of bed so have to wake DH in the middle of the night to help me up because I can't go more than 6 hours w/o peeing. Some nights it is easier to sleep in the recliner so I have more independence.",

Otherwise, I probably would have traveled to Gainesville or Tampa.  I am really healing up faster than anticipated.  I have tons of swelling in the breast area and I wear a compression bra 24/7.  I was instructed to for the first 6 weeks.  At first, the surgical bra they had me in after surgery was the only one that would work, but just in the past couple days I can now wear a JCP Sports Bra.  It is very snug and uncomfortable, but this too will pass.  I still have numbness on my back and sock like feeling under my arms (from the lattisimus dorsi procedure). I'm still going to take it pretty slow and easy this week. Hope you continue the great healing.  Paula and Jacqueline - Will be thinking of you this week and praying for a smooth recovery.",
