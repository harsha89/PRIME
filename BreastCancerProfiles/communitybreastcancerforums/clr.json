I'm sure you're anxiously awaiting your results - I expect to be where you are right now in a couple of weeks. (this long holiday weekend couldn't have come at a worse time- the waiting is just brutal) I hope that all will come back ok for you.",

I am seeing a surgeon in a week (originally they gave me an apt. in 2 weeks, but I kept calling back to say I couldn't wait that long!)  My gyno said that since they are 3, he's not sure how they will approach biopsy.  Has anyone got a 2nd opinion prior to diagnosis (ie. what is the best way to biopsy).  Also, would you think that they should also US the right breast - I have very dense breasts.
