I turned 51 in June.  I was diagnosed in May, lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on June 2nd, tumor 1 cm.  Clean margins and no node involvement.  Was ER/PR+   I had Mammosite radiation last week of June.  In July I had the Oncotype test which came back at 20.   The chance of recurrence for me was 13% with Tamoxifen for five years, and 6% if I have four rounds of chemo before the Tamoxifen.   My oncologist and the second opinion both recommend chemo, but left the choice up to me.  I have pretty much decided to have the chemo because I need to feel that I have done everything possible to give me the best chance.   It's a very personal choice, I have friends and family weighing in with recommendations both ways.  I think I just need to know that I did all I could. The hair thing concerns me too, the oncologist says that I will lose it.  But, I have made stupid choices before because of vanity and I won't let that influence my decision.  Not that it doesn't bother me, but what happens, happens.

I just wanted to say that the tea tree oil is for the fingernails and toenails.  To help with peeling, cracking, coming off the nail bed, etc.  You brush it on the nails.  It isn't for neuropathy.  I think that some girls have recommended taking vitamin B6 for neuropathy.   I don't have any experience with that, at least not yet. Peeps, if you call ahead to the ER or have someone with you to go in first and tell them that you are a cancer patient undergoing chemo, they will put you in a separate place to wait, away from the sick people. Threegirlsmom, I agree that you should probably not take anything before you have the symptoms for it.  I had diarrhea after my treatment and if I had taken a laxative or stool softener ahead of time I hate to think what a mess that would have been.  Certainly do take something as side effects come up, but I wouldn't try to outguess what they will be by medicating ahead of time. Best of luck to all of you who are joining us.  Read the September 08 board to see what we have just gone through and maybe get an idea what to expect.  (((((((hugs))))))) Chris ",

The call came this morning. Clear margins and no lymph node involvement. I am SO relieved. Going in Monday for an ultrasound to see if mammosite will be a possibility. Thank you for the good thoughts.",

I am 51, had a lumpectomy, no node involvement, mammosite radiation.  There was no real reason to believe that any cancer cells were left, but chemo would be a preventive measure. My Oncotype score was 20.  With the lumpectomy, radiation, and tamoxifen for 5 years my doctor said my recurrence rate was 13%.  With that and 4 rounds of TC chemo the recurrence rate would drop to about 6%.    I had my last treatment on November 17.   Chris ",

If that were the case you would have had more than a lumpectomy.   I know it's very had to be patient.  There are so many tests, and waiting for results between every one.  Hang in there, we've all been there before and I am sure you will be fine.  You can do it too.
