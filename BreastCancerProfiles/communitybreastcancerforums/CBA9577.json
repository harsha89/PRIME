I have had none..I read that most cancers grow in the outer quadrant. I am really concerned about the size 8cm x 5cm. Does that mean I could have a tumor that large? FINDINGS: There is scattered fibroglandular tissue. RIGHT BREAST: There is new subtle architectural distortion in the right upper outer quadrant spanning about 8 x 5 cm. Log in to post a reply",
