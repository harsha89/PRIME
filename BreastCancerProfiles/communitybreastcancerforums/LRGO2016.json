I highly recommend renting a lift recliner chair if you do go ahead with both surgeries simultaneously. I used on after my BMX and it was a godsend. You will be unable to use either your arms or stomach muscles much after these surgeries so getting out of bed will be very difficult if not impossible. You can rent one from a medical supply store. Get one that will stand you completely up or recline you back to a 45 degree sleep angle as you may be required to sleep this way after the mastectomy. Speak to your doctor about renting a chair, it may be covered by your insurance. Good luck! I'm so much more relieved to be rid of the tissues that were likely susceptible to cancer. I'm BRCA1, not BRCA2 but I understand your worry and decisions.",

I'll be calling his office first thing today! Only about 24 hours left with these cancer-prone boobs in place. Unless they postpone surgery to allow me to get over this cold. I called my BS office and told them about the cold. Have not heard a response yet, flooding has disrupted normal operations in Houston, Ugh. Fever at 99.8. Dangit! Tylenol drops the fever, but wonder if they need a non-medicated temperature report to decide? Hesitant to take tylenol before I go to the doctor. Oddly enough, my BS has not told me what time to show up on Wednesday. I called the surgery center to check. They said it looked like I was on the schedule for a 6 am arrival, but to check with my surgeon to confirm. Wish he would call me back! How are you doing? I'm praying for you and your doctor's to successfully remove all the cancer! I can't imagine what you are going through. Hang in there. When this is all over, we need to have a simultaneous party in our respective cities! A cancer-free celebration! I play percussion in a band here. I plan on beating a few drums when this is over and I have use of my arms again! Woo hoo!",

I recommend it to anyone who has a history of cancer in their family! \"A Cancer in the Family - Take Control of Your Genetic Inheritance\" by Theodora Ross, MD., Ph.D; 2016 Dr Ross is a cancer survivor and a top genetic researcher in BRCA1 genes who understands the impact that cancer has on the individual and their families. She translates complex medical facts into laymans terms. She helped me accept my newfound awareness of my BRCA1+ status as a gift! Her positive message helped me transform my anguish into action! In addition to explaining genetic risk and cancer types, stages,and treatments in easily understandable terms, this book contains an exaustive list of really helpful cancer information resources and links to active foundations and research. I read the entire book in 4 days, devouring the information before undergoing my surgery. It helped me digest and accept my genetic inheritance and helped me navigate the difficult task of telling my family about my choice and the implications of my genetic information and their own genetic risk. Learning about my genetic risk and sharing it with my family may save their lives! It has already likely saved mine. What a gift knowledge can be when we use it to make good choices!

First, no-one has any right to be judgemental...it is not their body, not their choice, and none of their business! Just sayin... I'm with you about the biopsis - I actually had a melt-down the last time I had one... the pain was really nothing but the idea of the entire process just overwhelmed me. I simply can't live my life worrying about needing additional biopsies every 6 months and waiting for cancer to appear. So right or wrong, for better or worse, I'm getting the source of this stress removed. I have a back scratcher and a gripper to pick up dropped things. I'll add the stool softeners and some soluble fiber the list. I have a belt and mastectomy camisole for the drains. A close friend is coming over this week to help me rearrange the bedroom and clean the carpets. My auto recliner rental will be delivered on Saturday and I've got lots of pillows ready. Another friend came over last week and we cooked lots of wonderful favorite foods. This food is now in single serving packages and sitting in the freezer at waist height. I'll stock up on yogurt this weekend My PS is planning a slow fill process (about 50-60 ml) per week. I'm hoping this will minimize the pain even if it extends the process.",

I am VERY proactive in everything I do... a \"Lead, follow or get the H out the way\" kind of lady... I'll be insisting on exercises post op. I don't want to seize up or lose range of motion because of this. I suspended my gym and personal trainer (hired to help me after abdominal surgery some time ago) for the next few months. When the surgeon releases me to work out again, I'll be right back at the stretches and weights. I know I'll be starting with much less weight than I can do now but will be working to regain my current strength as soon as possible. I don't intend to let this medical phase limit me, no matter how hard it is to overcome this surgery.",

      "Content": "Apr 14, 2016 08:38AM - edited Apr 15, 2016 12:43AM by LRGO2016 thanks for the encouraging words an recommendations Positano. For sleeping I have rented a powered recliner that can lift me to a standing position if needed. I've arranged for frequent house cleaning services while I'm incapacitated, have had cooking parties and vacuum sealed meals in single serving pouches I can heat and eat. What has led me to this decision and the need to marshal all my bravery was after testing BRCA1+, I was sent for an MRI. A 4mm spot showed up and a biopsy ordered. The MRI guided procedure and waiting afterwords was distressing and I decided that no matter the outcome of the biopsy, I did not want to live my life dreading mammograms or MRIs every 6 mos. I've had two breast biopsies in the last 7 years. Both kind of freaked me out. The first because there was significant pain during the procedure (insufficient numbing meds), the second because I knew I was BRCA+ I figured it was cancer. Now knowing I'm at heightened risk plus the fact I form microcalcifications and have dense breast tissue, every time I have a imaging checkup I'm likely to have more biopsies. Given the fact that I'm in the 87 % risk group, it really makes the decision obvious. I'm hoping that no cancer is found when they screen my removed breast tissue. At the moment, I'm living under the assumption that this choice is truly prophylactic and will help me avoid the path of chemo and radiation. I won't know otherwise until the surgery is over. Crossing my fingers for a clear result. How are you doing since your Feb surgery? You are 2 months along the path now. Are you having reconstruction? Are you receiving chemo or radiation? How are you feeling overall. I hope whatever route you must take, that you come out on the other side CURED! That is the goal. What we sacrifice to get there is only trading up for a long and healthy life to follow. That thought makes the loss of my breasts seem an unfortunate but minor rough patch in my life. I will recover and I will find peace with whatever I look like afterwards. I'm hoping for a good (if not perfect) reconstruction outcome and many years enjoying my retirement. I have a goal, I want to walk the Appalachian Trail. I'll probably do it in stages. This surgery will make it far more likely that I can achieve this goal rather than succumbing to the scourge of cancer. It really is a \"no-brainer\". ",

I know this was the right decision by my doctors and though I broke down and cried when I found out, I am relieved now. I was a lot more worried about the coughing and fever than I realized. After accepting the news, I was able to sleep for nearly 6 hours! I think that is the most sleep I've gotten in days! I awoke drenched in sweat so maybe the fever has broken and I'm on the mend. Either way we are doing the rightthing. Thank heaven for the fabulous doctors I have access to here in Houston. Thanks to everyone for following my thread and staying in touch.

Ask also about range of motion exercises (what to do or not by what date). I've gotten a remarkably limited amount of guidance on this so far. I think because Ive done this surgery preemptively, and no muscle or lymph nodes were lost, I don't have the same limits you might be facing. Clarity on that concept would be nice. My guess is that each of us will have a specific regimen to follow designed for our individual circumstances. Please ask your PS if post surgery Rom exercises are different for each patient or there is a general set of guidelines most can or should follow. Find out whether they want you to walk and how much. I've gotten different answers from different doctors and nurses. As of today, they want me to limit my walking to short and slow forays. But I'm feeling like I could walk miles!

This means I made the right decision, just in time! As my BRCA+ status indicated, my breasts were ticking bombs, waiting to explode. We diffused the bombs successfully! My first fill today was only 40 mls each. I started with 100 mls at the time of surgery. So as of today, I have 140 mls in each. No pain with the process! I'm still a bit sore/bruised from the surgery so the pressure of the needle and fill made me more aware of my post surgery tenderness, nothing more. The feeling of pressure on my chest, which had subsided, is back. No doubt because the pec muscle is under extra tension again. It doesn't hurt but does feel constricting. It was quite interesting to watch the breast mound lift a bit. I am capturing each phase of my journey in photographs so my hubby took pictures of the procedure! Syringe, tube, needle, breast, inflation underway! Very cool clinical photo. New foobs, here we come! I'm really elated to learn I had no cancerous cells in the biopsies. Tonight will be the first night I can sleep easy since learning of my BRCA status. It has been months! I feel like shouting out to the world and every woman I know, get tested, find out your risk, do something, BEFORE cancer strikes! Every person on this forum is here because they are affected by BC. It breaks my heart to hear their stories and be powerless to help. I believe that someday a cure will be found, and this disease will be easily cured without the invasive and otherwise harmful treatments we must use today to kill cancer cells. My journey to this place and the loss of my breasts began when I was born. My genetic makeup dictated my path. My choice to address my risk proactively has saved my life!!! It is as simple as that. I want to start a new foundation to raise money for Breast and Ovarian cancer research! I am going to name it after my Grandmother, Bertina Edith Connor, who died of ovarian cancer at the age of 49. I was only a baby when she died and was too young to remember her. But my mother says I have her personality and remind her of her mother. My vision is to help families gain awareness of the power gained with genetic knowledge. To stimulate a proactive movement toward using genetic risk to make appropriate and life saving decisions, and to fund genetic research into finding ways to transform broken genes into cancer killing cures! The study of genetics is so young, we have so much to learn, this means we have tremendous opportunity! My thoughts tonight are with every woman and man struggling with cancer. I will do what I can to help you in your fight! Keep fighting and have hope. I and many others are also fighting to help! LRGO2016",

Dr Ross is a cancer survivor and specializes in cancer/genetics research. The book contains a tremendous resource list for patients and their families.

It can save your life by giving you a view into the future and the ability to choose preventative options. Genetic knowledge can save your family as well. If anyone in your family tests positive for a known cancer gene, everyone in the family qualifies for preventative screening. Her book and advice helped me embrace options that I now know likely prevented me from developing cancer.

Had to have a hysterectomy and oophorectomy when I was 42. Lost my grandmother to ovarian cancer (age 49), other grandma survived BC, but we have extensive family history of others with BC or prostate cancer, stomach cancer... I decided the writing was on the wall and got genetically tested, (+BRCA1), opted for PBMX. Though this choice has been difficult and the surgeries tough, I am glad I have decided to take as much proactive control as I can in my health care. I have completed the PBMX (5/2016)and exchange to anatomical implants (8/2016). They found atypical cells on biopsies of removed materials but no cancer. As a result, I don't need rads or chemical warfare. Additionally, I no longer have to face a 6 mos waiting period of worry between checkups, and no more mammograms or mri. I feel free. Truly free of a ticking timebomb. Though I still have a 3-5% chance of developing BC, it is so much better than the 87-90% risk I was facing..... I will be in a hightened screening group for the remainder of my life and we will be extra vigilant with other cancer screening tools. I'm recovering well from my first two surgeries. Still have several more before we are done with the process. It is a tough path to follow but I'm glad I had a choice and the courage to take this step. My oncologist said I was likely only a year or so from a cancer diagnosis and all the more dreadful treatments that would require. My advice to anyone with atypical results: If you have choices that allow you to improve your chances of avoiding cancer, it is well worth considering those choices. Discuss your best options with your Doctor and then choose the path you are willing to walk. My case was both a hard but incredibly easy decision. I had a \"crystal ball\" giving me a glimpse into the future. I chose to aggressively fight the odds. Only time will tell if I will win the gamble. But I feel I have done everything I could to minimize my risk and I sleep easier because of my choice. I hope each if you have as supportive a medical team as I have and can make decisions that bring you a sense of control and peace, whichever way you choose to take. And I wish you all good luck with your diagnoses, treatments, or monitoring. Suggested Reading: \"A cancer in the family\". By Dr Theodora Ross. ( If you have a known genetic risk.) It is an uplifting and informative book with lots of good resource information in the appendix.",

Any change in outward appearance and the sudden onset of breast pain should be addressed appropriately by your medical staff. Good luck!",

Right now I have them hanging from a lanyard. It keeps them handy where I can see them easily and empty them as needed. I wore my camisole home, it was great for holding everything in place. When I go out to my first checkup next week, I'll wear it . My husband has tube stripping duty as I don't have the ROM or strength to do it myself. He did fine at the hospital and will do fine tomorrow too I'm sure. Right now my boobs are wrinkled empty bags of skin. I can see the drain outlines under the skin and the tissue expander forms in there. I dont think there is much fluid in them yet-but I forgot to ask the surgeon if he added any fluid to start. I'll find out next week. As for now, I'm completely at peace with it all now. I'm actually rather intrigued by this process. I look at these funny looking deflated sacks that were my boobs and I am really curious how they are going to change with time. I'm not even worried at how misshapen they are now because I've got faith in my PS and his ability to transform these sacks into new perky boobs. WOW! This is going to be an interesting experiment! We will be photo documenting the whole process starting tomorrow. The scientist in me is back in control. I'm the experiment! I've never done this before so I'm actually finding the whole idea rather amazing. I plan on being proactive and driving the outcome. If I'm not happy with the results, I'll ask him to fix it... plain and simple. I've seen his work and the results look good. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll be one of his Model patients who he wants to show pictures of to other women embarking on this journey. I'll be happy to talk to them and to try to help them find hope for a new future. But that is WAY off in the future for me right now. First I'm focused on simply healing. Getting beyond the discomfort I am currently experiencing. Thank you so much for being here to encourage and support me as I march through this process. You are a treasure to me!",

I managed to lose 30 lbs in the past year by working out and attending to my diet. I want the trend to continue! I think I have figured out that all the stabbing post surgical pain I have been in is associated with my drains. After they removed two of them, so much of my localized pain has diminished. Now I only have pain on my left side, right at the spot where the firm part of the tubing rests on a rib. Did you have any issues like this with drains?",

My nerves are stretched and I already had a bit of a meltdown today. Back in tenuous control right now. My rental recliner is in place. I got my face and under arms waxed today. My freezer is packed with meals. Need to pack my bags for the hospital. I have appointments for a manicure and pedicure on Monday. And a massage and hair cut/flatiron Tuesday (my hair is curly and tangles - flattening it will make it easier for DH to brush it for me). Thanks for the cautionary comments Lisa. Tape will go on the wall tonight but I will wait to get the ok from my docs before trying any ROM exercises. I've studied the exercise links for PBMX +TE . Minimal movements for two weeks. I understand and will comply. (I'm a workout rat so this will be hard - erg) Don't have a definite time yet from my surgeon - he has been out this week attending his annual board cert training courses. Should get my appointment time on Monday. I've run myself down working doubletime on job stuff and prep for my convalescence. Got a cold two days ago so my PC put me on antibiotics as a precaution. Starting to feel better. Will be resting up for next 3 days. Working on Monday but taking Tuesday off to get mentally ready. Once I'm at the hospital, I'll calm down or tell them to go ahead and help me relax. I'm certain this is what I must do. Hoping it will turn out to be soon enough to truly be prophylactic.

I am hoping my family will be proactive with their own health care and giving them this info will allow their doctors to assist with proactive screening. I'm only two weeks away now from taking the plunge. As the date nears, I find myself being more anxious. I keep telling myself that once it is over, I will have eliminated as much risk as I can that I will have to fight the Cancer monster... After reading about and meeting with cancer survivors - I know I am LUCKY to have this option. But the rational side of my brain is at war with the fearful side....

My current goal is to not have a permanent flat, scarred chest to remind me of what had to be sacrificed to save my life. Even though this choice is a preventative measure, having to deal with a lifetime daily ritual of surficial or stick-on forms or stuffed bras to fake an appearance of normalcy to the outside world just saddens me. I'd rather suffer with these surgeries now to make it possible to rebuild a sense of confidence in my physical appearance. Call it whatever you want, vanity or insecurity, for me having breasts is a part of my inward and outward identity and I'm not ready or willing to give them up. I'm unapologetic about the choice. I'm a planner and doer. I've decided to go the full route - expanders, new nipples, areola tatoos, and if my normal keloid formation rears it's ugly head, I'll undergo scar revision. I'm also considering decorative butterfly tattoos if the scars bother me. Why not turn the scars I know I will always carry into a work of art I will love to look at! I'm lucky to have a supportive husband who says he loves me, no matter what my chest comes out looking or feeking like. So we are walking down this dark and scary path together. I hope you and all other ladies going though this have someone to make this journey with. If not, I hope this website and our blogs here offer some comfort. Hang in there! Once I'm on the other side of surgery 1, I'll post as soon as I'm able to reassure you and myself that life indeed goes on and joy will return with a bright promise of a cancer-free existence.

I can't even imaging what I'm going to experience. So I'm planning to just take each day as they come, do what I'm told by my medical team, and worry about the outcome later... I have to take this process in small doses. Like you I have read, Read, READ! These forums have been more helpful than talking to my med staff in many ways. There is nothing better than advice from those with experience. I'm a scientist and very pragmatic. I'm going to have to let my logical side take over for a while. The little emotional girl in me will cry I'm sure, but the scientist in me will gather data, analyze the outcomes and hopefully will help heal the emotional scars that will form and eventually fade. I hope you have as strong a support network as I do! I'm sending you my positive energies support from Texas. Keep your courage and wear it as a badge of honor. You are strong, beautiful and a gift to this planet and to me. Thank you for caring!  ",

I'm dreading this journey but know it is the correct choice. When facing a difficult set of options, I always charge in and confront the situation with as much courage as I can muster. Right now I'm reminded of the time when I was about 6 years old, I was sitting on the ground, playing in our yard and a large stray dog charged me - barking . I had nothing but a twig in my hand but I stood up, swatted at the dog and yelling, charged back at the aggressor. The dog was so startled by my actions that it stopped its attack, it's eyes got big and it turned and fled. I've never forgotten that instinctive response and valuable lesson. I'm standing here now, twig in hand, yelling at this aggressor too! I'm charging forward tomorrow, and I'm going to chase this beast away as well!. But what is different now is I'm no longer alone. We are not alone! We are doing this together, and we are accompanied by our teams of surgeons, loving families, and newfound friends and BC sisters and brothers. You all are in my thoughts and prayers and I am inspired by your support and solidarity. Let's run screaming at this and chase away our fears as we emerge, victorious on the other side, cured of this disease and no longer afraid. Our hearts will be pounding, and we will probably be shaking for a while but we will win! And we will be stronger! Grab a twig and stand with me! Scream or sing as loud as needed to frighten away your fears!.",

Explaining every sensation to expect and how to address it. Excellent! I'm mystified that my Dr's have not directed me to any if these types of sites or even some documents outlining specific post surgery stretching of their own design. It is as if they don't acknowledge post surgical trauma or the adverse impact of mastectomy on ROM. Maybe they are dismissing my case since I did not lose lymph nodes, but I am certain the reality of breast removal and insertion & inflation of TE's will require that I stretch daily. I wish they would give me more guidance on the specific stretches that will provide the best outcome in my recovery. Maybe they simply don't know... I might need to ask for post surgery PT if I am unable to regain my desired ROM. this site should help for sure! Thanks, thanks, thanks ! ",

      "Content": "Apr 15, 2016 12:27AM - edited Apr 15, 2016 12:28AM by LRGO2016 Thank you kindly, Georgia. I've always been a happy and upbeat person. I intend to stay that way. I know I'm sad at the loss of my breasts. And a meltdown will likely happen the night before surgery. But fortunately I will be able to have a close facsimile of them in place by Christmas. My b-day is just a few days before my surgery so I'm giving myself a \"Get out of cancer free\" card for my birthday and a new set of custom replacement boobs for Christmas! My husband and I typically give each other practical gifts for these occasions. This year really takes the cake! I'm glad I can be uplifting for others who are experiencing so much worse than I. My heart reaches out to all of you!",

As disappointing as it is, it was the right decision. Your trip to the beach inspired me and my husband to take this change of plans and spend a weekend at the beach ourselves. My surgery date has not been decided yet. Likely to be in late May or even in June depending on schedules. I wont know for sure till next week. So weekend after this, we will get a really swank room at a resort in Galveston, do a romantic and carefree weekend walking on the shore and getting lost in each others arms. I hope you have a GLORIOUS time! Take lots of pictures! Wear something that makes you feel beautiful and laugh till you can't breathe! The memories you create this weekend are just the beginning of a new lifetime of wonderful memories. Enjoy every minute!  ",

You should be supported in finding relief from the pain and disfigurement, no matter the prognosis. I'm not familiar with the medical establishment in NZ. If there are no laws requiring proper revision, are there any advocates for this sort of thing in country? If not, does anyone know whether BC.ORG can help you find a solution or place for to start looking for help?",

He did a great job revising the scar and now I have two darn \"good looking\" seams beaming at me where my nipples used to be. After 4 surgeries, I'm sporting about 18 separate scars on my front torso now. Some small, some large. Some have faded, some are hard, thick or red, years later. Has anyone found a good method to soften, and fade the stubborn ones? I'm trying massage and vasoline for now. Cheap and easy to do... ",

I'm hoping to bring our concerns about a good and pleasing outcome post mastectomy or lumpectomy together where we can share what works to reduce or mitigate scaring issues. I am one week out from my BMX. My breast remnants are really puckered, wrinkled and generally quite unattractive at the moment. I have chosen to reconstruct with TE's, and silicone implants beneath muscle. I would love to hear from anyone who can give me hope that the fill process and fat grafting step will eliminate the \"grand canyon\" creases currently positioned where my boobs used to be. Also I'm looking for suggestions on how to minimize my scars. I tend to keloid a bit so any ideas you have to help me achieve a \"barely there\" scar set would be wonderful to hear!

My right side is not stretching uniformly so the TE on that side is expanding in two separate areas, leaving a low spot in the middle. Think squeezing a baloon in the middle and watching it expand on either side of your fist. My three week old incisions which I called the \"Grand Canyons \" are starting to be less indented as we fill my TE's. They are still a bit puckered but I expect that appearance will change as the Te's fill up. If not, no worries since they will open the scars up at exchange and will have an opportunity to remove or fix any remaining wrinkles and puckers. I'm very allergic to surgical glue so that may pose a scarring challenge for my PS. He will have to perform a miracle with tiny stitches to minimize my scarring. I'll be asking him about what he plans to do at exchange. Do you still have drains? I do and am getting increasingly worried about infections. These buggers are still draining more than 30 mils daily. Will this never end!? ",
