    "Content": "blinds23 wrote: Hello Everyone :) I just turned 23 and I have stage 3 breast cancer. I'm suppose to start chemotherapy treatments soon. Which is better? The port or the IV? I tried to research and couldn't find much. I have concerns for both because with the IV i'm worried about the markings and consistently having to get the IV. My concern with the Port is I usually only wear tanks and I may become self conscious knowing it's there. Any advice is greatly helpful!
