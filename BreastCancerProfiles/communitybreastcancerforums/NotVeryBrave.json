I'm very nervous about radiation, but understand that it's necessary to get similar results to mastectomy. My first hope was for partial breast irradiation, but I've been told I can't do that because of having chemo - even though the chemo was specifically for HER2 positive status and not extensive cancer. Now I'm looking at proton radiation as opposed to photon or regular radiation. From what I've found online - it has similar results with perhaps less SE's. Can anyone tell me their experiences? Number of treatments? SE's felt? Did you get multiple RO consults? Thanks TCHP x 6 with pCR. One year of Herceptin. DTI pre-pec surgery. Quit Tamoxifen after 3 months.

I feel like I probably shouldn't be too worried, but it's hard not to go there. I've always heard the \"any concerning symptoms lasting more than two weeks\" thing. I started having pain in my tailbone or coccyx probably five weeks ago or so. I did not suffer any type of injury nor did I take up any type of new activity. At first I thought that maybe I had just been sitting too much or in an odd way or something. I think that I have lost some of my gluteal muscle mass. But even with adjusting my sitting posture and sitting less, it still hurt. Now it hurts even when I lay down in bed at night. I saw my MO today. He asked if I wanted him to examine the area or just see my PCP. I opted for the PCP because I got the idea that he thought it was nothing. And honestly - I'm not sure that there's anything to examine. He mentioned my PCP ordering an xray if he wanted. Has anyone else had this? What was the outcome? Diagnosis? How long did it last?
