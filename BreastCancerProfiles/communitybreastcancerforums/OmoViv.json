    "Content": "OmoViv wrote: I started feeling that both breasts feels different since last august then later I felt it more pain sensation on the left breast and sometimes on the right. I felt for lumps on both breasts and they seem the same only for the left breast which is the slightly bigger breasts feels a bit larger than the right ones but there numbers are the same I think. Later on I felt thickening of the upper parts to the collar bone more on the left breasts.the irony is that I feel this way for some time and it goes away then comes back. I don't get to feel the pains few days before my period,during my period and days after my period, and then gradually,it comes back,at the upper middle of both breasts I feel lumps. Now the collarbone of the left breasts feels thickened off and on and I could visibly see the veins there not on my breast. Please does any one have an idea of this sort of thing.scared to go see a doctor.I'm 29yrs old Log in to post a reply",
