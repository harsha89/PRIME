I also noticed a lymph node in my right armpit that seemed larger. I have since had a mammogram and ultrasound which revealed nothing, but did state that I have dense breast tissue. I was referred to a general surgeon who sent me to have an mri with and w/o contrast. I was told the lump looked similar to scans from two years ago and was likely just a lymph node and probably nothing to worry about. I have an appointment to go back in three months but I'm concerned that I should seek out a second opinion from a breast specialist. I have read about false positive mri but not a lot about false negative. Should I seek out a specialist or wait and watch?",
