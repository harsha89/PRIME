I felt so much better after I left. My MO said the red chest could take a year to fade but I think it's looking pretty good. The fatigue I attributed from the radiation may be attributed to the Arimidex I will be taking for the next five years. Still doing my best to get my energy level up.",

I did read that the mammogram after treatment is uncomfortable.  I know I plan on taking a Motrim 800 before mine.  I don't have a date yet.  I see my MO in August. I can tell you that my cousin had a similar size tumor, lumpectomy and rads.  She took Tamoxifen for five years and is fine now.  Her BC was in 2000.  She has been Cancer Free for 12 years! My tumor was a similar size and I was also stage 1, I had a lumpectomy and radiation also.  I am taking Arimidex.  I was probably neg and you were probably positive, if I understand all of this.  Any side effects from the Tamoxifen?  I can't complain much about the Arimidex but it's a good thing I am taking it at night.  After my pill, I fall to sleep, within 30 minutes.  I wake up when my legs start cramping, it's getting better.    Are you still red from the Radiation? Any lasting symtoms?  My breast is still hard and very red.  ",
