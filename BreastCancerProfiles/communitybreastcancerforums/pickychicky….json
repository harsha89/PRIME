My Oncotype DX score was 12 and my Dr. said probably no chemo for me. It may change as I had a UMX yesterday and they'll look at the pathology, but I'm hopeful. It seems like it is terribly hard on your body and you should be the one deciding if the risks outweigh the benefits.",

I'm home and on my couch, which makes me so happy! Surgery was delayed by almost two hours, so I was super fearful it would put an end to my outpatient hopes - but it didn't. So - UMX started at 12:45, got in car to go home by 4:30. I've got Hydrocodone for pain and an anti-nausea med. (don't remember what it is and can't be bothered to walk into kitchen to get bottle LOL). We stopped on the way home for dinner because I was starving and I wound up with baked ziti and meatballs. Can you believe it? I ate some and feel fine. I'm going to go ahead and take the pain meds this time - I think I'll probably need them. One drain under left arm - already had to empty it once. Here's wishing good luck to all who had surgeries today and prayers and good wishes for those still to go.",

Had a nurse follow up today - staples are out, steri strips are on. I couldn't watch her remove them - it was too much. Didn't feel a thing, though.  I did have pain when she re-dressed the drain. Turns out we had inadvertantly gotten tape attached to a stitch last time and that was causing the pain issues when the tube was moved around. I felt terrible for DH as I couldn't help crying while she was messing with it and he felt so bad. All redone now and feels ok. Next follow up with BS on Friday and I've got my fingers crossed for the drain. I'm at about 40cc daily now, so hoping it is down to 30 by Friday... Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday!",

I want to make sure he understands that I will not have reconstruction, so want the scar area as flat as possible. I think I'm also going to ask if he'll do it as outpatient surgery since I'm not having the lymph dissection. Can you think of anything else I need to clarify? Was there anything that you wish you'd cleared up?",

Had my first post UMX visit today and was really anxious about looking down at my chest after the Dr removed the dressings. The tape removal hurt a whole lot, but thankfully he said everything looks perfect. I beg to differ as I have a huge row of staples across my chest and a tube hanging out of my side. I've got suture removal scheduled for Tuesday and a re-look at the drain for possible removal. How does that timeline sound? Less than a week for staples? Believe me, I'll be happy for them to be gone, but that seems fast to me. I was able to take a bath today (little water, no dressings got wet) and felt a million times better. For those celebrating this week, Merry Christmas and/or Happy Chanukah!",

The BS must have gotten it all with the lumpectomy, although he didn't feel good about the margins. So - all clear - two additional nodes taken and clear. Since my Oncotype is a 12, no chemo! I'm also down to less than 30cc for two days, so looks like the drain will come out at my BS follow up appt this afternoon. Such excellent news for the New Year. Now, I've just got to get through radiation and I'll be done. Good luck to everyone still waiting for results and having surgery. Happy New Year!",
