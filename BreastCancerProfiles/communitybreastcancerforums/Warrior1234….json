I\u2019ve noticed that it seems to be given out when there are lung mets, my mom hasn\u2019t mentioned this and I\u2019m scared to ask her incase her OC hasn\u2019t told her or that she doesn\u2019t want me to know, do you all think that it might have spread to her lungs? And do you think the navelbine will help with her breathing? Thanks Ps you guys inspire me with all your positive thinking and energy, keep fighting!",
