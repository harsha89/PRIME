I'm thinking I don't want to put off sharing too long as I think that just leaves more to be anxious about... and I can control that. Going to stock up on verbiage like rocking treatment, and kicking c's but.",

I am trying to decide when to tell the family, and thought those here may have some advice on what to say and timing. I see the Breast Surgeon next Tuesday, where we may have a bit more information to share. All I really know right now is that it is grade 2, multifocal. Part of me is thinking of waiting until after that appointment to share the new. The other part is worried the news may not necessarily be good news and it may be better to share what information we have so it's not totally over whelming. I've two young adult sons in their early 20's. One has GAD, so I worry about his ability to cope. Parents are away in Palm Springs and aren't back until April 6th. Do I call them? I had been planning a wedding in the Niagara Region which doesn't look like that will happen and we have friends who have booked flights and hotels to join us. We have share the news with some people - like work... so I worry about the news traveling a bit. What does one say to put a positive spin on all this? Oh man..... Log in to post a reply",
