Now in 2009, 13 years later, same thing, same breast.  Just like the first one, but a little higher.  I recognized it at once.  Very small bump, just under the skin.  Like a tiny BB under the skin above the nipple.  I had the tumor removed a few weeks ago, and have been advised that for a second lump, the only alternative is a mastectomy.  My path report is pretty good, .9 cm, invasive ductal carcinoma, differentiated 6/9, and not particularly agressive. I do not want to rush into this, and frankly December would be a much better time than now to have major surgery.  Does anyone know anything about the risk factor after what is basically a second lumpectomy?   Lots of people delay radiation, so what is the big deal about delaying mastectomy?   Frankly, I am not convinced my risk is all that great, but I cannot find any statistics of course, because everyone does the safe thing and gets a mastectomy.  I am willing to do the surgery, but does anyone know anything about the risk of rouge cancer cells spreading through the bloodstream?  1996: Lumpectomy with 15 nodes removed + radiation. Sept 2009: lumpectomy in same breast. Jan 5, 2010: unilateral mast with immediate silicon implant and Alloderm.

      "Content": "Nov 1, 2009 09:43AM - edited Nov 1, 2009 09:45AM by AnnL Thank you so much everyone.  What a smart, and at the same time, sensitive, group.   You have given me the same sort of thoughtfulness that I am seeking from a doctor.  I think there is a real problem because everyone is directing me to a surgeon for a second opinion, and what I really need is a breast cancer expert that is not so blindly focused on surgery. I am thinking about starting a new post, maybe \"Tumor recurrence after 13 years -- is mastectomy only option?\".  The article Lindalou posted suggests that a second post-lumpectomy radiation is an alternative in my case.  The article also indicates that statistics are better with a mastectomy, so I will probably do a mastectomy, but I do not wanted to make this decision by being treated like an child/idiot by the doctors. PS to unklezwife, I had a first lumpectomy/radiation in 1996.  In 2009, I had a second tumor, which has been removed by lumpectomy.  Now I am being told my only option is a mastectomy.",

      "Content": "Nov 1, 2009 04:10AM - edited Nov 1, 2009 04:38AM by AnnL Excellent replies, and thank you so much for the articles.  Just exactly what I was looking for.  I am in Austin, Texas, there are plently of hospitals and cancer centers here.  I am looking for a doctor that will give me something other than the automatic \"get a mastectomy\" response.  I may end up getting one, but it annoys me that for a recurrence after 13 years, my surgeon is not displaying a little more imagination and curiosity about treatment options.  The surgeon that removed the recent tumor seems more interested in frightening me into immediate mastectomy than in considering my individual case.  I am getting a second opinion and have an appointment this week. One of the articles above explains my situation exactly.  Apparently, an important factor is whether the tumor is a \"new primary\" or a true local recurrence. Here are my 2009 pathology results:  invasive ductal carcinmona, 0.9 cm, moderately differentiated 6/9; ER/PR pos, Ki-67 pos, HER-2/NEU status neg.  Because so many lymph nodes were removed back in 1996 (negative for metastatic carcinoma in 1996), I am told that lymph node metastatis is not an issue).  The path report says positive margins, but apparently that is because the lump was just under the skin. I did not have any treatment other than radiation in 1996 (tamoxifen was not used then like it is now), and apparently, because of my pathology, chemical treatment is not appropriate in my case now.",
