    "Content": "mind_boggling wrote: Hello everyone, sorry for the late reply. We just went home from the hospital since my wife was admitted for 5 days. She had the mastectomy done. Fortunately, it was successful then. They removed the left breast and as well they did the node clearances. It was a very difficult for us at first to accept this kind of circumstances because she is too young to have it all; however, we still stand firmly and believe that God has a purpose for both of us. The reason why the doctor advised her to pursue this surgery it's because he just wanted to examine if there is still cancer cells left on her left breast. Since as you can see the histology report posted above, it came up that upon examining the tumor that has been removed - as they put the Indian ink, it showed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, involving theÂ inked resection margins. Actually, the doctor doesn't know yet what stage she is in. Unless the whole left breast is going to examine. So according to the surgeon possibly there is still cancer cells that left on her left breast. Don't worry guys my wife is definitely fine. I know during the day of her surgery, miracles just happened. She recovered fast and not even a single dose of morphine (PCA) she had it, because according to her it was just a slight pain and if she were to rate the pain from 1-10 as 10 has severe pain, she is in the rate of 2 which is bearable only. Not until the next day when all the staff and doctors, including the anesthetist did their rounds were so amazed by her condition, you can see her radiant smile on her face. THUMBS UP FOR MY WIFE! And the doctor said he was so happy to see her like this and hoping that all patients must be like her never grump. The doctor said we'll just wait for the histology report again to see what would be the next thing to have. To tell you frankly, never at times we forget to pray to God for a good histology result. I truly believe that every trial there's always a blessing that comes next. You know guys, just this morning when the doctor spoke to the pathologist it was great news to hear from him saying that there were no cancer cells found and even the nodes were clear. --------- NO CANCER CELLS FOUND!!! That's what came first in to my mind and I shout out loud ----- Thanking God ----- What I did is I hugged my wife tightly and there were tears on her eyes. We're very happy and blessed by it. My wife now is doing some range of motion on her left arm just to prevent lymph edema. I'm assisting her doing all this things every day, especially now that she needs me to help her regain her body normally. What makes me glad also that before she had the surgery I let my wife choose whether to have her breast or her life? And of course she chose her life though. Because I don't want to lose her and we still have lot of dreams to fulfill especially that we've been praying for a baby this year. We've been married for 1.4 years already and been trying to conceive. I know everything now is under God's control. He cured my wife. Nothing is going to worry because God listens and answers what we've been asking for Him in our daily lives if we just remain faithful and hoping for the best. In this experience I and my wife learned so many things in life especially on how to become a strong person. Before I end, I just want to leave a message for all of you guys out there who has breast cancer, \"Trials exist not because God wants to test you. That's a lie. He already knows your capabilities, more than you could imagine. Trials exist because you need to learn one thing: FAITH. I hope in some way it will help you relieve of whatever feeling you have right now. I know it's difficult but we have to know that life is full of challenges. By the way, my wife will be meeting the oncologist in two weeks time to discuss some important matters whether to have the chemo or not. What do you think guys? As what the surgeon have told us, my wife is actually healed theoretically but one thing he wants to be sure that this thing will not going to recur since we already knew that cancer just comes and goes, what the doctor's concern is he doesn't like my wife to suffer then in the future. She will do the MRI and a PET scan a well one of these days just to examine it. The bone scan, mammogram and CT scan chest, liver, abdomens were all normal --- I had mentioned that before. But anyways, thanks for all your prayers and advices here. Because of you guys, you gave my wife the strength she needed during those hard times she had. Thanks you once again and hope to hear more responses from you and I am here to help you guys also if have any questions or prayer requests to ask. I and my wife are willing to include you in our prayers. JUST THINK OF THIS: THERE CAN BE MIRACLES WHEN YOU BELIEVE. Am I right? God bless and more power! Log in to post a reply",
