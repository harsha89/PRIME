I want to second one of the ladies on here that said \"get thee to another doctor\"at a well reputed cancer center pay the money make the trip and get an informed opinion from a doctor who will put their opinion out their from experience.  My neighbor died last year from breast cancer diagnosed in June died in January. She was triple negative a different story from you however her husband says his biggest regret is not getting her to Sloan Kettering hospital in NY (I believe) for a second opinion before it was too late.  If my doctor had said to me that chemo was up to me(which it is) I would still choose to err on the side of caution. But that is just me YOU have to do what is right for you but I strongly advice a second opinion before you quit!",

I was throwing up had diaherria. Bone pain heartburn. All of itt!  But I have had my second treatment they adjusted some things and this time I had almost no side effects. Certainly nothing like the last time.  It is your decision but it is your best chance to not have this cancer come back or spread anywhere else. It has already happened to you twice!  It is also obvious from your picture that you have a lot to live for. Those beautiful kids need you to be around for a long time!   It may be really hard and I know you will make the right choice for you. But if you talk to your doctors I am sure they will make changes that will help you get through it.  They have recommended this coarse of treatment because they think it's your best chance at living a long cancer free life and your dr from ca concurred.   Right now I have 2friends here at home both have nasty melonoma with metastasis and there is no treatment for that no chemo that works. So they have to try experiemental treatments with no guarantees they would give anything to have the opportunity to to take chemo if it would work!  I hope I don't sound preachy. I want you to see that you can do this it won't be easy but you would probably be very thankful you did in the Long run!  Good luck and I will keep you in my prayers!",

You are tougher than you realize.  You will get through it. But tell your team, so they can help you.",
