      "Content": "Blythers wrote: My main saurgery was March 6 with a follow up on April 2 (for an unclean margin). Over the past week or so I have been experiencing nipple pain. Its not severe but its bothersome and a little scary. I have read that I should call my doctor but I don't know which one to call. My HMO is so disjointed I don't know who would know anything, care about, or have an idea of what to do. I already frustrated about the run around for my chemo...which has been delayed again because \"we don't have your mugascan results yet\" (it was done three weeks ago and two doctors have it\" and \"oh, the chemo nurses are ALL OFF ON FRIDAYs\".My primary doesn't know anything, I saw my surgeon a total of four times; two office visits and two surgeries (he's not going to have much to say about nipple pain). My oncologist? I don't think so, plus she only works on Mondays at the facility where I am allowed to see her. I just feel so drained...I had to call in sick to work becasue I can't stop crying.

Just today , my onc nurse called to ask about some doctor's notes the onc didn't receive. I had them in my binder and faxed them right over. I also keep ALL referrals, work FMLA stuff, and a calendar in there!",

      "Content": "Blythers wrote: I have been looking for others starting chemo in June. I found one group but it was really leaning toward Taxotere which sounded a lot different than what I experienced after my first and only treatment on June 7th, one week ago. My treatment is A/C Every three weeks-4 times Taxol Every three weeks-4 times Herceptin (starts with the Taxol) and continues for one year My chemo facility doesn't seem as good as some of Read and heard about. there is only one spot for one visitor and that visitor is kicked out if there are more than three patients.Â  Two days after the treatment I started feeling some light side effects...dry mouth, nausea, and I was a little tired. I know its supposed to get worse every time but I'm doing this one treatment at a time. I'd love to hear from anyone else in this boat!!!!!!
