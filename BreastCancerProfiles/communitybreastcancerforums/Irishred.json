But  I am hopeful, the Dr and his staff were great.  Gave me a ton of material to read and a teddy bear (so cute) Any way I am so lucky to have the support I do My sister will be with me for surgery and the three days after constantly.    Who knows thursday after surgery I might even feel like dealing poker (which i do for a living)  Any way,  if anyone has had this type of surgery IE. sentinel, let me know how it worked out.  Thanks Log in to post a reply",
