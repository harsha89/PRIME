I have told minimal people which makes it much more difficult because I feel so alone. I just want to know either way. The wait feels like forever and I truly am trying to remain realistic as opposed to catastrophic. I will definitely post my results and appreciate the support. :) Zukee I am sorry that you are going through this as well. I realize that the BIRADS is definitely not a diagnosis however there are several things in both reports that have me worried such as bilateral BIRADS 4C, in a line behind the right nipple, in a group in both breasts with additional scattered calcification, and pleomorphic microcalcifications. I will keep my fingers crossed for both of us. :) My emotions fluctuate so quickly: one minute i feel strong and fine, the next minute I feel scared to death, the next miute I feel overwhelmed with sadness, the nesxt minute I am angry. I think of my children, I think of my job, I think of how unfair this is, and I also think of all the brave woemn that have been through this.",

It was horrrible, I was sweating, and could feel myself fading. Luckily they did the most concerning side first. I meet with the surgeon tomorrow afternoon. I\u2019m sore and feel drained as though I\u2019ve been hit by a truck. I had all the kids stay over night at my sisters because I didn\u2019t know how my mental status would be. I was so physically drained from what happened immediately after the procedure that I slept the rest of the day. I will post after my appointment tomorrow. Thank you for all the support.",

I\u2019m definitely trying to keep myself busy until Tuesday and then I will get the results on Thursday when I meet with the surgeon. I feel so exhausted. I\u2019m also recently separated and have three kiddos plus I\u2019m a Clinician so I manage everyone else\u2019s emotions and struggles all day and all night and for the past two weeks I have just wanted to have a tantrum of my own and tell everyone to solve their own problems. Lol! Instead any second I\u2019m alone I have a meltdown. Didany of you who have children tell them? My kids definitely know something is going on. And my twelve year old son is starting to get angry with me Beciase he feeIs like I\u2019m hiding something. I really don\u2019t want to stress them out anymore than they are.",
