But the good news is that there are a lot of treatments for this type of cancer, depending on what your pathology dictates. If you are contemplating mastectomy, please PM me. I've been through it as well as lumpectomy and RADS the first go-round and have some perspectives you may wish to know about. There are pros and cons to any choice you make. I agree with folks that you should definitely do your research. However, as my radiologist told me, be careful on what sites you glean your information from. Not all sites provide correct information. And you could worry yourself sick. Fill every minute with laughter, even if it starts off fake - chemically that works also! This was my mother's advice 21 years ago when she was diagnosed - stage 3, bilateral IDC, triple negative, numerous lymph node involvement. And the best thing? She will be 85 years old this year!!!",

OncotypeDx tests 21 genes and determines the percent chance over a 10 year period of time for distant recurrance. It does not predict chances for local recurrance at all. Not everyone is a candidate for this type of test - it generally is meant for early stage BC women (stage 1 or 2) with 0 nodes involved who will be treated with hormone therapy (ER+ cancers). The purpose is to determine how beneficial chemo would be for you. The lower the score, the less chance you have for distant recurrance of cancer and the less need for chemo. While it was originally meant for premenopausal women they are now finding out that the test can also be beneficial for node positive post-menopausal women. TE means tissue expanders. They stretch the skin out to accomodate implants. Generally the skin is stretched gradually with fills (adding more to the expanders to stretch the skin out). One thing you need to know is that radiation can cause issues with implants because it affects the skin and its elasticity. If you have a lumpectomy, radiation is a given. If you have a mastectomy radiation can usually be avoided, depending on the cancer. There are options other than implants should you choose the mastectomy route. There are perforator flaps (DIEP, SGAP, etc) that use fat from either your abdominal or butt area. It is a microsurgery and a long surgery but spares muscles, unlike LDAP or some TRAM flaps that use muscle, generally combined with implants. Many plastic surgeons will not tell you all options, only the ones they are familiar with. If you are premenopausal the hormone therapy would be Tamoxifen, if post, then probably an arimotase inhibitor. Rads plus lumpectomy is considered equivalent to mastectomy in terms of survivability. However, they are not equal in terms of prevention of local recurrance. Those are two different things and many BS's only talk about survivability. I personally chose lumpectomy plus rads and tamoxifen when I was first diagnosed in 2006. My BS felt I had an extremely low risk of local recurrance. BUT - I had a recurrance 2+ years later and required a mastectomy and elected skin sparing bilateral mastectomy with immediate SGAP reconstruction. I elected not to have the nipples saved and they were not affected. There are a number of reasons to consider regarding this. PM me if you'd like additional details. I can tell you some of the pros and cons of each type of treatment if that might help you make a decision. I was stage 1 IDC, no node involvement, low oncotype dx score.",

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2010 05:09AM CharlestonGirl wrote: The main reason is that there is no way for a surgeon to remove every breast cell from the nipple. So by keeping the nipple you keep a risk and will continue to have mammograms for that reason, even following mastectomy. Also, unless you are going to end up the exact same size as before the nipples are likely to be off center and a reconstruction may not look that great. They will not have feeling as they did before (this can happen with lumpectomy also and did for me) and also they will not react to touch or temperature as your nipples currently do. Also, with reconstruction, a good PS can make an extremely realistic-looking nipple and aereola from skin flap tissue that then gets tattoed with color to match your remaining breast or former breasts, if you have bilateral mastectomy as I chose to do. When you've been through cancer and then have a local recurrance as I did you want to do everything possible to minimize risk. So that is the main reason I asked them to take the nipples. I knew they were going to not have feeling anyway so it was not a big deal to me. And my PS gave me very realistic-looking nipples and aereolas, matching my original ones as far as nipple size, etc. I just got them tattooed a few weeks ago and in another couple of weeks I should be able to see the final color. Radiation and lumpectomy - Pros - you get to keep your breast. There is less recovery time. Your lymphatic system in your remaining breast tissue stays. Cons - the radiated breast will generally change shape and texture; many times will end up higher than the other breast. Will sometimes become misshapen. If you ever do have a local recurrance, you will have a mastectomy and then the radiated tissue will generally not do well with implants and will have further issues with healing for any type of reconstruction, increasing chance of failure. Even with the best of equipment radiation still tags a small part of your lungs and if on the left side, there is more risk to the heart. If you are a smoker side effects are generally worse. Radiation destroys good and bad tissue, including damaging lymph nodes within your breast tissue and if they irradiate under your arm at all. Radiation lowers chance of local recurrance by 70%, less than mastectomy. Hormone therapy will lessen cancer recurrance even more, which is why they will add it to the ER+/PR+ patient. Mastectomy - Pros - you generally avoid radiation (unless the cancer dictates otherwise). A reconstruction will do better if the tissue hasn't previously had radiation. The risk of local recurrance is lowered by 98-99% (the 1-2% is because you never can remove every cell). Mammograms are generally no longer required (unless you save the nipple). Cons - longer recovery time if you have reconstruction done. The reconstructed breast will likely not be a perfect match to the remaining breast. You may decide to have the other breast lifted so they match better. 50% of women do not get sensation back to the breast (as in skin numbness). Nipple sensation will be gone. Some women freak out about losing their breast. I did on my first diagnosis. I've realized since then, especially after my 2nd diagnosis and subsequent reconstruction that you can get some terrific-looking breasts. The plastic surgeon used is critical!!!! From a survivability perspective, both options statistically provide the same results, even though mastectomy lowers your chance of local recurrance more than lumpectomy+ radiation+ tamoxifen.  I think this is because you are watched more closely and if cancer does recur they generally will catch it fairly early. Some people are not good candidates for tamoxifen because their bodies do not process it as required for it to work well in combating the effects of hormones. I, unfortunately, fell into that category. So for those people the tamoxifen does not provide the extra protection so the rad/lump route is not as effective. Before you go through tamoxifen treatment make sure you have a vaginal ultrasound to test the thickness of the endometrial lining & to check for potential issues that tamoxifen could worsen. If necessary you would be treated prior to starting treatment. Don't let them skip this step. With the size of your tumor it is not likely that you would skip chemo so the oncotype dx test may not be that helpful. Read up on it, though, because they are finding out that it provides more information than even 3 years ago, when I was tested. Some women freak out because of the thought of having their breasts removed, \"being butchered\" , losing nipple sensation etc. With lumpectomy and rads I lost nipple sensation anyway. Two years after diagnosis the left breast had a non- cancerous papilloma removed and I lost nipple sensation there also. If you nipple is involved I would be shocked if you do not lose sensation there because they cut nerves when getting to the nipple tissue (or near it). The choice is personal and you need to ask yourself what your goals are and what treatment would make you feel most safe and comfortable. Obviously, as I look back, I wish I had chosen the mastectomy from day 1. But that's because I had a recurrance. I'm not exactly sure what I would have chosen if my surgeon had really discussed the side effects of radiation in regards to reconstructive surgery if that had to occur. I asked my surgeon at the time and he just said I'd have to have a mastectomy if I had a recurrance and would then have reconstructive surgery. I was very lucky in that I've had good results from my reconstruction, but many ladies aren't as fortunate and the ones that go the implant route face a very high failure rate and issues. Again, though, many women do not have recurrances. So there you go. Not an easy choice. Lots of things to consider. At lumpectomy they will remove tissue until you get clean margins (no cancer near the edges). This may or may not require removing enough tissue such that the breast can get pretty deformed. Your doc can probably tell you more of what to expect if you go this route; I don't know what your tumor looks like and they are all different. I've got to scoot, but send me a private message if you'd like more detailed info. I always check that before I read various posts. hugs to you!",

She says that while she does not have sensation in her nipple it does react to cold and touch. She has a lot of sensation within the rest of the breast and her surgery was in November. So, that is amazing and I've not heard of that before. It takes about a year or more to recover whatever sensation you will recover from what I understand.

Because my tissue is also dense, MRIs were recommended starting a year after RADS. In December '08 I had an MRI that indicated a suspicious area and in Jan '09 had an MRI-guided biopsy that indeed confirmed another multi-focal IDC (1mm and 2mm). Because of previous history I wanted to opt for Bilateral Mx and reconstructive surgury (in my case SGAP). However, at the time of Dx I had just found an eating plan that worked for me (I had gained a good bit of weight after a hyst/oopherectomy courtesy of tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer in '07). Anyway, my PS said if I was really going to lose the 30 lbs that was my goal it would be better if at all possible to delay reconstruction until that time for best results. My oncology surgeon said that because my IDC was low grade (not aggressive) he felt that a few months wait would not hurt but not to wait more than 3 months. So 10 weeks and 25 lbs later I had my BMx and immediate recon. Today is my anniversary date, in fact, of that surgery. So, there you go! Every case is different and, depending on a lot of factors, you might easily be able to wait a few months or, depending on biopsy results, immediate surgery might be indicated. Breathe deeply and try to remember that this disease is one of the more treatable cancers. Not that you asked or anything, but why are you considering LAT flap instead of the newer SGAP, HIP flap or DIEP recon techniques which are muscle-sparing and don't require any additional implants? The NOLA in September thread is full of information regarding folks going through this. Are you located in the US? Please PM me about this - I'd like to share additional info if you are interested.

They should be able to tell you the initial results - how aggressive it is, etc. If it were hightly aggressive in nature I wouldn't think they would wait to do a lumpectomy, so that should be encouraging to you. But in any case, if the doc didn't go into detail discussing the results of the biopsy a phone call seems to be in order. By the way - my mom? Next weekend we'll be celebrating her 85th birthday.

Both DIEP and SGAP, HIP flap and IGAP are microsurgeries and the docs need special training for those. They do take longer but then you don't lose any muscle and you don't have to deal with implants. Let me know if you want any further info muscle-sparing flap surgery. Best of luck with your decision, whatever it might be.

But it sounds to me as if the jury is still out and your docs can't agree whether or not you have IC in the first place. Where are you located?  What kind of docs were your first and 2nd opinions? 2. You can have both false positive and false negative results on FNAC. This type of aspiration obtains less cells than a core needle biopsy, vacuum assist biopsy or surgical biopsy. The important thing is to get a positive identification of the mass. If this means a biopsy where a larger sample is obtained, then do it. Both core needle and vacuum-assist biopsy can be done with local anesthesia. It doesn't matter what the chances of false positive or false negative is on FNAC if there is any question about the diagnosis. 3. Obviously you've been doing a lot of research and have read that nipple discharge, scale, crust are a symptom of Paget's disease. STOP MAKING YOURSELF CRAZY WITH WORRY! Paget's disease is very rare, for one thing, and also this symptom happens in other cases and can be related to a benign condition. I know of someone with discharge who has DCIS. Do not diagnose yourself. And please realize (as my radiologist told me) that not everything you find on the internet is valid. Did any doctor say you had Paget's disease? If you aren't sure what your doctor meant, ask. All we would be doing is guessing what he might have meant by the comment and none of us can know what he meant. Oncologists and breast cancer surgeons are used to us asking the same questions over again and in different ways until we understand exactly what they meant, so please call him. Even the idea of BC is unnerving, so please, get clarification! 4. Your FNAC suggests a potential malignancy and recommends a biopsy to rule it out. The chest xray confirms a round mass. Your ultrasound says that the margins are smooth and that is indicative of a benign mass such as a fibroadenoma. So you have a round mass with smooth margins that can likely be benign. But because the FNAC shows some abnormal cells standard procedure calls for biopsy. 5. My advice is to not even think about Paget's disease. Get your mass properly diagnosed 6 & 7  - See #5! 8. Exercise, proper nutrition and certain supplements have been shown to affect longevity and survival rates. For example, if you have an ER+ cancer, having low body fat (which can be obtained through exercise and proper nutrition) helps because fat is one source of estrogen. This is just one example. I joined a dragon boat team for that very reason. PM me if you want further details. You may or may not need an MRI unless the docs want to use that to guide the needle. You probably need a biopsy, not necessarily a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy right away. Probably a core-needle biopsy to get a better sample of tissue. But, ask the doc. They know your case. Sex life - probably the best bet for you, since yours is getting affected, is to alleviate your anxiety by taking the next step and finding out what you have. Anxiety can kill sex drive. So breath deeply to the count of 4, hold to the count of 3 and exhale to the count of 5. Do this for 10 minutes. Then use all that extra calm and clarity you gain from this exercise and call your doc and insist on a test that will give you a definitive answer. Your last point - What is a SARAH curve? That's a new one on me. My last point - You might also want to start your own post so people will specifically answer your concerns instead of getting them mixed up with Diane's thread. Hugs and best of luck. Let us know when you get a definitive answer. PLEASE, whatever you do - don't wait another 3 years!!!! Worry and stress can be very bad for you!",
