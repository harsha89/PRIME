I've been pretty much pain free untill the last few days.. I've had that sloshing noise and when I told my daughter she laughed at me so I thought I must have been imagining it lol. On thursday fluid was leaking out of my nipple and panicked me so I went to my GP, the nurse there put a compression bandage over the leaking and stopped it as it was quite a lot. My GP put me on antibiotics in case of infection.  I phoned my breast check nurse for advice and she said it was quite normal to have this leaking and that I didn't need the antibiotic.  I then phoned the nurse at my GP's and mentioned that the breast nurse said it was seroma, the nurse at the GP said she had heard of this but obviously it hadn't occured to her while treating me. She advised me to keep taking the antibiotic untill she had results from a swab she took.  So basically I'm confused now wondering if I did wrong having the compression bandage put on to stop the fluid leaking. I have a lot of stabbing pain over the last few days and the sloshing noise is back today. On a good note my surgeon has got a clear margin and my nodes were clear. Sorry for taking over your thread Shayne, but as I'm new to this I'm not sure how to start one and I've found all comments very informative on this thread. Best of luck to you in your recovery and to all others posting on this thread. ",
