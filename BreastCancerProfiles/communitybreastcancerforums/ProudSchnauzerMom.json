Pretty overwhelmed with everything; cancer, planing for surgery, having surgery (bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction), what to expect, work, being a burden on my sister and my little dog. I'll need to travel by plane for surgery and then recover at my sister's house. My dog is welcome to come. Is it best to board my dog and come back for him in a few weeks? Or fly with him? My life is such a mess. Just wondering if anyone has found a good solution for their pets while recovering. Log in to post a reply",
