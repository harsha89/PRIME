Mine is not movable and rooted to the chest/ribs as well. I would say it has a more elongated shape and is maybe 1.5\" long and narrowish. Figured this following event was unrelated until now, but a week ago I had some mini sharp pains as well. I thought it odd, but was not concerned until I found that mass. I don't eat well/much because I am busy with military work/life. Have never had a mammogram. Last breast exam was Summer of '09. Should I be concerned? A local hospital has a 24hr hotline to call and schedule mammograms same day. @Worried: I really hope your wife is healthy.",
