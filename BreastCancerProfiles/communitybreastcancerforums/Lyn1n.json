Still sore.  Had another mammogram in February 2011 and it still showed nothing.  I was told I must have heard my muscle under the breast (although that part wasnt the sore part it is in the breast)  I accepted it and carried on.  It only got worse.  I had another mammo in June 2011 and it showed nothing.  I had so much pain that I cannot lay on my stomach in bed, hug or touch it at all.  It is not red or scaly or anything like that.  Just sore.  Just the right breast only.  In the summer I got a  bacterial infection in bladder area and I was prescribed antibiotics for 10 days.  Although my breast pain *seemed* to lessen quite a bit while on the antibiotics.... about 4 days after I finished them my breast pain came back.  I got so fed up I went back to the dr.  He was really booked up so I got in to see him in early October 2011. He booked me a mammo.  I had the mammo on Dec 6 2011.  I had it done and afterwards I was called back in to get more pictures as they saw something in the right breast.  I did what they said.  Afterwards they said I had to go have an ultrasound within 30 minutes.  The dr. was there and he said he'd meet me there.  I did.  I had it done and he came into the ultrasound room and said to me \"We have a situation\"  I said \"What?\" and he asked if BC runs in my family. I told him yes.. My mom died of BC and my moms twin sister as well.  He said I am in a high risk category.  He said he had to do a biopsy.  The biopsy was scheduled 6 days later.  During the biopsy he said he was testing for BC.  I have not received the results yet.  The dr offices are closed here right now for the holidays.  I am beside myself with worry.  My breast is very sore to touch on the inside.  He said the tumor is solid and has microcalcifications  on the inside.  He said it is very round but he said the inside is questionable.  The tumor is at the 10 oclock position.  The pain is all under the breast and deep inside the nipple.  It is hard and thick and does not match the left breast.  They are different sizes since this began.  I cant really explain it.  The thickening area is very hard and firm and the left breast is like normal jelly and soft.  I hope to get my results soon and I am praying they are benign.  Praying so much.  I was very surprised that antibiotics seemed to help earlier in the year.  But my dr said that any tumor benign or malignant can cause a small degree of inflammation that can be helped even a little by a course of antibiotics although it does not cure the underlying problem.  Good luck lele!  Thinking of you as we are going through this same thing.  hugs!  Lyn1n ",

I went to on call told me she is going to try to get ahold of my dr. to get him to hurry up and open them results. She prescribed me Ativan and it is come see come ca so so working.. working and not at same time?  Make sense?  sigh... :( PS Thanks for spiting bricks for me.  I appreciate that.  It REALLY does help.   I really hate the health care system here.... you are right... so unacceptable. =(",
