    "Content": "susrichmond wrote: After my bilateral mastectomy last week, I was given one of the camisoles with the fiberfill inserts. The inserts are way to large. I�ve removed about half of the fiberfill, but that made the cover way too large. I tried pulling the excess material to the back and pinning it, but that doesn�t look right. Have any of you had this problem and if so, how have you solved it? Also, the inserts are oval. Are they attached with the long side vertical or horizontal? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
