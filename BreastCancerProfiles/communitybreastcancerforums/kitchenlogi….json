So far the fuzzy growth is shiny white (I'm 51) but there's dark brown mixed in. I'll try to be patient! Thank you Clarice - I'll hope for a growth spurt! Westiemom - I could not wear a wig. Kudos to you! Fingers are crossed for a thick head of holiday hair!",

It'll be 3 years at the end of this month since my diagnosis. All is well! Mine was also IDC grade 3. All you can do now is put one foot in front of the other. Let your beautiful daughters know that you're going to do everything you can to be there for them for a very long time.  I found a book, when I was diagnosed, called \"Just Get Me Through This: A Practical Guide to Coping With Breast Cancer\" (available at Amazon) and it had a lot of great information that didn't scare the heck out of me. Your life is forever changed. A lot of good things will come out of it, I promise you. You just have to go through some rough stuff to get to the good things.  My best wishes for you and everyone else new to this horrible journey. Kathy",
