I am aware of the drains that are normally put in after breast surgery, but this surgeon was insistent that I did not need them because of my age and the state of my breasts. He said he would not recommend this to someone who was older. He tapped on my skin and tested the collagen (I think). When I told him I had seen a reconstruction surgeon he said \"WHY!?\" shocked and insisting I most likely would not need any. This was actually not what I was wanting to hear, I was devastated because after 2 months of researching reconstruction options and reconstruction doctors and mentally torturing myself trying to make a decision I had finally made a decision of what type of surgery to go with. This was actually using a reconstruction surgeon that this breast surgeon works with (he also is highly sought out and I really got a good impression from him). This breast surgeon told me this is what he would recommend if I was his daughter\u2026 so I decided to trust him. I'm honestly not questioning his judgment in the type of surgery I got. Right after I was done with surgery I was expecting my breast to be half deflated but it looked amazing (without any reconstruction)! I thought he must have some sort of magical powers to make it look that great. The fluid did build up in my breast but I was told that would happen, I went to see him, he saw it and said it was fine. I have also done some of my own research and I have read that the fluid is reabsorbed by the body and scar tissue eventually forms. My problem is that the incision sight seemed to become infected which caused the seroma to burst. There was still fluid left and the bacteria was allowed to grow in one of the other seroma pockets so now I have this yellowish infected fluid (instead of the clear fluid you would expect in a seroma). I encouraged some more of the infected fluid out on Saturday morning and most of it seemed to be gone. I have not leaked since then. Now the fluid seems to be building back up, I am only hoping that the antibiotics took care of the infection and the fluid is just the clear fluid that is expected. Gemma, I'm so sorry it took so long for yours to clear up! It's really good for me to know, because maybe I will ask for more antibiotics once the 7 day supply is over. How did you know that the infection was still there? Was it because you could see at the incision site or it was leaking? It seems fluid is just building up deep within my breast but I'm not sure if it's infected still or not since it's not leaking and I'm not able to see the consistency of the fluid. Thanks so much Elaine, that is also my understanding about the fluid after a lumpectomy. What is ALND? How long did you have your drain? I'm just curious.",

Here are the details of my specific situation. Friday (1/16): Surgery to remove 2 very large masses (5.6 cm & 4 cm). I was told that the area would fill with fluid and then turn into scar tissue so although the masses are so large, \"fluid is our friend\" and will help keep me the same cup size, so I would not need reconstruction. Monday (2/2): Post-Opp Appt, my doctor used his nail to scratch off the glue holding my 2 inch incision together... Saturday (2/7): I wake up to a horrible smell and my shirt and bed is soaked. I get up and look in the mirror and fluid starts pouring from the incision site (massive amounts at a rapid speed). At first it was yellowish but then it was just red and more clear (w/ a little mucus). My doctor says that there is nothing they can do, to just pad my bra with gauze and that I will be fine and to call the office on Monday to give an update. I asked if I should go on antibiotics and he said that he did not think it was necessary. A few hours later it stops leaking. Sunday (2/8): It starts to ooze again, but nothing like the previous day. It stops again a few hours later Monday (2/9): I call the Dr Office and they ask me to make an appointment with one of their nurses to come in so I can be seen. I make the next available appointment (Tuesday). Tuesday (2/10): I have not leaked since Sunday at this point. I could tell that I had a lot of fluid still left inside of me but the incision site looked good and I was no longer leaking, so the nurse did not see reason to aspirate the fluid or prescribe antibiotics. Wednesday (2/11): The next day I noticed a yellowish/white cloudy fluid becoming visible between the incision site (on the other side where it had not drained). I called my Doctor's office and told them I really thought I would need antibiotics. The area was swollen, red, painful, and warm to touch. They prescribed antibiotics and I started them Wednesday night. Thursday (2/12): The next morning massive amounts of pussy fluid started streaming out of my breast at the incision site. I stood in the bathtub helpless for over an hour trying to get it to stop. The flow was so fast and of such a large amount. Once the flow started to slow down I packed my bra with gauze (continually changing it) and called my doctor. My doctor said that since it was pouring out on it's own, they did not want to aspirate. If they did try to drain it I would be left with very pour cosmetic results since the fluid is what was supposed to help keep me the same cup size. Friday (2/13): I could not sleep at all last night, if I turned on my side more fluid would pour out of the incision site. I encouraged some of the fluid out by applying a small amount of pressure but I can still feel there is a ton of fluid deeper within my breast tissue. So far all seems to be completely infected (yellow/whitish cloudy fluid). (1) Are the antibiotics going to be enough to get rid of this infection? When I look online it seems that the consensus is that it has to be cut and drained. I really do not want to have to go in and be drained, but I don't want this infection to get worse. (2) How can I tell if the antibiotics are working? This evening will be 48 hours of antibiotics. I still have pain, there is still a lot of puss filled fluid inside my breast, but I do not have a fever. (3) How much longer should I expect to see the puss before I should become concerned? I am very concerned because they asked me to give an update on Monday, which means I will have to get through the weekend (they do have an emergency line I will use if necessary but I wanted to ask my questions now). I have a note out to my doctor so I am sure they will call me by the end of the day, but if you have had any experience with this, I'd greatly appreciate if you would share. Thank you!

I saw that you had asked how I was doing last Thursday and it really touched me that people care so much :) That night was actually a terrible night (the worst I have had, much worse than the surgery!) so it was really nice to know you were thinking of me. I said that everything looked good last Tuesday, well on Wednesday I could see yellowish/whitish fluid poking through the incision site again and the incision site was starting to turn red. I could tell the fluid was building up again and that I would burst any day. I called the nurse just to let her know that it does not seem to be over, but that it looks like it's going to burst again. The receptionist at the office asked me if I could come in that day so the Nurse could see me. Apparently the Nurse I have been seeing has breast cancer and will be having surgery (by my surgeon) the following day and will be out of the office for weeks! I felt so sad learning that\u2026 but she seems to be in good spirits and it really made me feel good that she was having my surgeon do her surgery when she had a choice of anyone\u2026 He does seem to do good work. The next few days I leaked a little bit, but it's more like a oozing rather than gushing like the previous times. Today I look good again. It's not oozing right now and the incision site looks good. But this is what has happened the past 4+ times. My breast drains, I start to heal, then it fills back up and I have to go through the painful process all over again. I'm wondering how many times is this going to happen? I'm hoping that since this was of a different consistency this will be the last time, but who knows, I just usually try to be optimistic. My next appointment is not until April 1, so I really hope I do not have to go through this anymore.",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2015 02:17PM - edited Feb 14, 2015 02:18PM by Daisey4522 This surgeon is actually my \"second opinion surgeon\" so I'm a little torn right now.. The first breast surgeon I went to see told me that since they had to remove so much mass from my breast that I would need a lot of reconstruction. They suggested implants or getting a reduction on my \"good\" breast. I was so upset and worried I had no idea what to do! I was told I would lose 2 cup sizes (I'm naturally a D to DD) and another surgeon said 40% of my breast. I found this other Surgeon (my current surgeon) after reading reviews. He is actually a highly sought out top surgeon with extremely high ratings and I have to travel to another city to be seen by him. He is the director of this particular Breast center, actually, I had to make my first appointment 1.5 months in advance! My situation may be different because I am on the young side for patients that are normally seen for these conditions (I'm in my late 20's). He told me that since I'm so young that he thought he could just remove the masses and that the area would fill up with fluid and then turn into scar tissue (the fluid is typically reabsorbed by the body), and therefore my size would stay the same. I was actually shocked after the surgery. I looked great! These masses were at the surface and so easily felt and were huge! (5.6 cm and 4 cm)! I looked the same size. The reason I am torn and feel a little upset with him, is because he used his nail to scratch off the glue covering my incision 2 weeks post surgery. I think we should have just left it on, and if he was going to remove it, then do not use your nail!! That was insane\u2026 I'm a microbiologist by profession so this is hard for me to think about! I just wish I would have thought of this the day he did it because I would have cleaned the incision site myself just to be safe. That is when I believe I got the infection. I cannot be certain it was from him scratching the glue off, but it definitely got infected after the glue was removed. So maybe it would have happened either way. But I will tell you, it has been pretty terrible\u2026 After I found that I was infected I was seen by a CRNP. I wish she would have given me antibiotics at that point. At least she listened to me when I insisted the following day. Today I'm feeling so much better because the infected fluid has drained (it is my understanding that we wanted to keep this fluid in, it's just that it became infected so that is why it is now bad, otherwise the fluid would have just been reabsorbed by my body). The only thing is I feel very tired\u2026 I am guessing from my body trying to fight off the infection. It's been 2.5 days since I started the antibiotics so hopefully I am on the mend. Thanks for all of your comments!!",

I didnt mind too much as long as I got to see my surgeon. The leaking of the fluid stopped about a week before my appointment (so I leaked for about 9 weeks!) The first few weeks were horrible with large amounts of fluid flowing so quickly but it turned into a slow leak that was much more manageable the last few weeks. It seems to have stopped leaking all together now, but my nipple does look a little funny. I can get some sort of reconstruction surgery for the nipple, but I'm going to wait for now. I'm just thrilled that the size of my breasts match! Both are still DD! I was so worried I would have a B and a DD like the first surgeon said. It seems like for now I can put this all behind me... well except I have an appointment with Radiology to have a bilateral Ultrasound. I'm not sure if they will be able to see much in my right breast, because I had those masses removed (I think my radiologist is not aware of that), but I have my 6 month follow up with the mass(es) I found in my left breast. There are two smaller masses in my left breast (that was not very concerned about). I had one of the 2 masses biopsied and it turned out to be benign (fibrocystic changes). So I am now going back to make sure that nothing has changed with the other masses since it was never biopsied. That appointment is on April 20. I hope all goes well so I do not have to have another biopsy!",

I think the fluid build up is what causes the pain. I do not have nearly as much fluid as I did last week but it seems to be building back up and it's right under the nipple and deep within my breast under the nipple\u2026 I notice it hurts more when I feel cold, so I think the tissue is trying to retract and maybe making it even more painful as a response to the cold? I have not leaked since Saturday morning so I'm not sure if the fluid is still infected. I suppose they would have to try to aspirate the fluid to test the resistance of the bacteria\u2026 but I am thinking that this antibiotic seems to be helping since I feel improved. I would think by now the incision site would look terrible and it looks fine. My only concern is will this 7 day supply of antibiotics be enough and how will I know without letting things get worse? I'll give them a call tomorrow and see what they say. Thanks for the help!",

The night after I posted in the forum I decided to encourage the fluid out myself. I mean it was completely infected, that should not be in my body! I got the majority of it out. I have a couple of swollen lymph nodes and I was feeling very lethargic this weekend (especially on Saturday) but not so much today. The area seems to be filling back up with fluid, but there is no way to tell if the fluid is infected or not since I have not drained or leaked since Saturday. Superficially everything looks really good, I'm just concerned with the fluid deep within my breast, since you were saying that if it was encapsulated the antibiotics will not work. I'd rather not be surgically drained if that's what's best I better do it! I am just feeling and looking a lot better today, so maybe I was able to get all of the infected fluid out and the antibiotics are working. I have a call out to the nurse (I actually had a missed call from her this morning I think she was calling to check up on me) but she is with a patient. I'm going to explain all that happened and at least ask if I should extend the antibiotics since I was only prescribed 1 week.",

I have some swelling, bruising, and pain, but I expected this all and I honestly don't feel any worse than I did when I got the Stereotactic biopsy. My right nipple has been slightly inverted/retracted for the past few years but since the surgery it has become very inverted. It may be due to swelling and could resolve on it's own. I have a follow up appointment in another week. Also, I got the final pathology results today and both masses are benign (Nodular Adenosis). What a relief! I have one more piece of advice that may help someone. If you are getting a biopsy or a breast surgery where they ask you to wear a tight fitted bra, sports bra, or ace bandage after the surgery, I found a bra that works so well! It really helped keep my pain down by applying the right amount of pressure. It's called \"Knockout by victoria's secret front-close sports bra\". It has a double closure in the front. It would be so difficult to slide a tight sports bra over your head right after a biopsy or surgery, and a back closure bra would also be more difficult that is why I was so happy when I found this front closure sports bra. The first closure is like a regular bra that snaps in the front, then another layer zips in the front over it. They also sell one that has only the zip layer, but I found that it was harder to hold the fabric together to zip without having the inside layer option. Good luck to you all! This place has been a really great support for me and I hope it is for you too no matter what the outcome of your test results, surgery, etc\u2026 that have something for everyone here and I'm really appreciative.",

My mother passed away of Breast cancer at age 42 (she was diagnosed with stage IV at age 41!) so I also had the BRACA Test, but mine came back negative. Also, when I was looking up reconstruction surgery I had decided to do the Diep Flap (my reconstruction surgeon thought I'd make a good candidate) but then my Breast surgeon said it was not necessary since I was so young. Just an update on my situation, it turns out that all of the seroma (fluid within my breast) became highly infected. It's thick yellow and has a strong terrible odor. I'm on antibiotics and it has been draining through the incision site on it's own. Very disgusting... It has not leaked since Saturday morning but I can feel that there is still more fluid left inside. I'm wondering if the antibiotics are going to be enough to take care of it without having it drained in teh doctor's office (they do not recommend at this point). They want me to call in tomorrow (monday) so we will see what they say then.",

I tried googling it the first time you mentioned it but I cannot find out what it stands for. Are you saying that the benign masses are what increased you by 3 cup sizes? If that's so, then wouldn't you be uneven in size after the mass removal and require reconstruction?",

I have not had an MRI, only sonograms and Mammograms, so it's possible they are not catching everything in my breasts. Why do you think insurance paid for the PBMX & Reconstruction?

Unfortunately my breast issues are not completely over because my breast filled up with an enourmous amount of fluid and then on Saturday it started pouring (literally!) out of the incision site. It was the most tramatizing thing I have ever experienced! I was convinced I would have to be rushed to the ER, but I called my Doctor and he returned my call quickly from home. He told me that it would be okay and to just use gauze to soak up the fluid, then call back on Monday. I called today and they are having me come in tomorrow morning since there is still some fluid left. Luckily, it does not look infected, but they mentioned that they might drain it. I really don't want to have it drained because in my case, they removed 2 very large masses right next to each other (5.6 cm & 4 cm). I was told by another surgeon that I would lose 2 cup sizes and another said I'd lose 40% of my breast. I did a lot of research finding the best Breast surgeon and the Breast Surgeon I went with told me that since I'm young he thought I would be completely fine (and so far he seems to be right, my size looks the same!). He said that fluid would fill the cavity and then turn into scar tissue, and so essentially \"fluid is our friend\", thus why I am skeptical to let them drain the fluid. The appointment is with a nurse tomorrow, not with my Surgeon. I really wish he could see it and tell his opinion. Wish me luck tomorrow!",

If you do not really have a good contact there then maybe discuss with your surgeon. But my guess is the doctor who reviewed your ultrasound and made the report would have the most information. Good luck!",

The radiologist said it looked breast tissue within breast tissue with a spot that has calcifications. I had a stereotactic biopsy so they could capture the caclifications and well as the mass for pathology. I was told that the mass is benign, but the final pathology report does not give me a clean indication of what exactly the mass is. Have you ever seen a Pathology report similar to this? Can you explain what any of this means? FINAL PATHOLOGY DIAGNOSIS: Right breast, stereotactic guided biopsy: 1. Benign fibroepithelial proliferation with fibroadenomatiod features (see comment) 2. Florid adenosis. 3. Apocrine metaplasia. 4. Microcysts. Comment(s): These findings may represent fibrocystic changes or a fibroadenoma with secondary adenosis. Some areas are suggestive of tubular adenoma. **Note: When I was 22 years old I had a sonogram guided biposy of what I believe is the same mass. At that time the biopsy finding was \"Tubular Adenoma\". I have seen a breast surgeon and they recommend immediate surgery to remove the mass because of the size, location (directly under the nipple), and the fact that it appears to be growing... but I'd love to hear from anyone who might be able to give me more information regarding what the mass might actually be or hear from someone who has had a similar pathology report and your experience with your mass.

I would ask your doctor if they found a mass or not. If they did find a mass, ask why they did not recommend biopsy. Hope this helps.",

I had a biopsy a few years ago that was determined to be benign and I believe this is the exact same mass that has grown from less than 1 cm to 8 cm! I always told my doctors about the mass (I could feel it and I felt slightly pain sometimes) but they would always just brush me off because of my age. Finally it grew so large in the past year or 2 my OBGYN easily felt it and instantly referred me for imaging. Almost 2 months later, after multiple sonograms, mammograms, and biopsies, I have seen a breast surgeon and although it is benign they recommend I get surgery to remove the mass immediately. I wanted to share this with you, because I think it would be wise to have the mass removed while it is still smaller. Now that mine is 8 cm, I am told that I will require reconstruction surgery. I will be left with two very different size breasts and since the tumor is benign I was told that insurance will not cover the cost of reconstruction. You will get through this! I've never had surgery before so I am feeling the fear that you are feeling. We should just be thankful that it is not malignant! All the best to you, Ginger",
