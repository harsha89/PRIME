She had the abnormality most associated with breast cancer risk, the 1100delC mutation. She is healthy so far, but her father has had both acute leukemia and male breast cancer. We're planning to see a genetic counselor on her next college break to learn more about what kind of screening would be appropriate for her. I thought people might be interested in knowing that the test is readily and cheaply available, although, of course, it doesn't provide any information about how to cope with the results.",
