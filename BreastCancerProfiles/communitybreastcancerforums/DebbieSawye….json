I am very fearful of getting lymphedema, so may be over reacting anytime I get a new symptom, such as three that are on the list you sent (infection, seroma, cording). I only had one node removed; the BS and onc said no way will I get lymphedema, but....I worry. Hence I wanted to get started on exercises as soon as possible, but I have a re-excision lumpectomy November 24, and have to start all over with the recovery process. Gosh I'm sorry to hear about your appaloosa. I've lost two in twenty years of owning horses, but the other four are still going strong. Yes, the avatar is my six year old gelding, Chip.

I realize there's a radiation thread, and I'll get on it when I get closer to that time, just wanted to hear your take on it. Hi Swimangel! \"Stage 1 Sisters who had mastectomies\"---I'm glad you mentioned that. When I was dx'ed, it was a Tuesday. On Wednesday I had to decide if I was doing a lumpectomy with rads or a mx, without much time for research.  At the time all I could think about was saving my breast, but what I've learned in the last 6+ weeks, I've rethought that decision. As I go into this second lumpectomy next week, I've decided if the margins still aren't clean, I'll do an mx; which maybe I should have done to begin with. My husband and friends can't understand such a drastic measure. I just want it over with...and not to lose any more lymph nodes! How are you doing? Are you done with surgeries? (sorry, I don't know the time frame of recon).",

Seems like our time is filled with either Dr's appts or waiting for results, doesn't it.  And wow, coconut cake sounds decadent! otter, prayrv--thank you for the suggestions on cording, I'll go there. Welcome MarciaGoudie! I haven't started rads yet, so can't comment on your shrinking breast, but someone here might have answers for you. You've read through all the posts on the radiation threads? Hey, we're pretty close to each other, I'm in San Jose. bluewillow, sido, makraz--the LGFB sessions sound interesting. I've never heard of them before, and plan on checking out their website.  As for piecrust, if anyone has a good homemade recipe, please PM it to me. I can make good crust, but it seems the flour these days doesn't make the crust as flaky as decades ago. I thought it was my imagination until my mom said the same thing. I've resorted to Marie Callendar's frozen pie crusts (okay okay, I know that's cheating!)",

Been enjoying catching up on the new posts. My weekend was swamped, and I'm heading out the door for mex and margs with friends, but wanted to stop by and say Hey. So guess what, my SNB incision is way infected. Started feeling it late Friday night, and today it is five inches of screamin'....red. It's starting to spread to the lumpectomy incision about two inches below. Oh oh. I was so swamped over the weekend, I couldn't get into the hospital, but I'm calling there first thing tomorrow morning. I wonder if this will postpone my re-excision on Tuesday? Any one have their SNB incision get infected? Oh, did I mention I have the seroma from hell in the SNB site, as well? It's been drained twice and keeps on coming back. Size of an egg. Ouch. Hi jeanneann8, I've been thinking about you too. Did you get my PM's?

It was offered and I had the test done, but results not back yet. My onc said \"only order it if you're prepared for the consequences\", meaning if it comes back a high score, chemo is a must, no choice. I'm gambling that with my 1's across the board (1.2 cm, Stage 1, Grade 1), my onco score will be low.
