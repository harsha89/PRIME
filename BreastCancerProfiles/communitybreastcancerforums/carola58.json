Currently on letrozole/ibrance. There seems to be a split of opinion whether a dmx would make any sense now. I realize it won't change the eventual outcome but there seem to be some opinions that removing the \"cancer factory\" might reduce total tumor load and extend time. Has anybody here made a decision in this situation either pro or con dmx? Log in to post a reply",
