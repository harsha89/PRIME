I had a radial scar biopsied in Dec (l/t breast), and was supposed to have a six month follow up visit. But I didn't get around to it until 8/29. The surgeon could feel the lump in question, and an additional lump (r/t breast). Last time, she sent me for a mammo and u/s; this time just an u/s. While I'm grateful I don't have to have my baps squoshed in that machine, I haven't been able to stop thinking that it is unusual for her to order just the u/s. I am just wondering if anyone else had a similar situation, and if this is a normal occurrence to skip the mammo, and go right to the u/s. Thanks, JJ. Log in to post a reply",
