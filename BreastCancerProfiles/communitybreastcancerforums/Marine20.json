My oncologist told me that it won't get any better so I'm stuck like this for the rest of my life. It's so frustrating having your independence just ripped away from you I'm only 48 and I feel like I'm 80 But the good news is I had my yearly mammogram and there's no sign of cancer I just wish I can get my life back  ",
