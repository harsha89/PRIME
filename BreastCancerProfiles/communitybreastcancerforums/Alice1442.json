Diagnosed/ surgery March 2013-Stage 2b, 2 small tumors, 2/11 nodes, clear margins but lymphovascular invasion (the scariest part!). Ultrasounds, CT scans and bone scan found no spread but we all know how that goes. Had 8 rounds of chemo over the summer, 28/7 radiation treatments in early fall, now on Tamoxifen. I'm just waiting now the 4-5 months for the radiated skin to be cleared for second stage of reconstruction, tissue expander is all filled and ready (looks like a baseball is sitting on my chest!) I just wanted you all to know that for the most part I have really been comforted by the fact that there are other people in this like me. Thank you for sharing personal stories and fears on this board, it has to be hard to write some of this but I am grateful that you all have. Bless you all!",
