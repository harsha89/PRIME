So I am approaching my year anniversary for getting 5cm of stuff removed from my left breast. Today I go for my now yearly mammogram. I am just wondering if anyone ever experienced pain in the breast that had surgery. I have two small boys that constantly elbow me in the chest and wrestle and everything. I have noticed more pain when bending over, I am just worried...I went to my suregon once already and he said it wasn't unusual as everything is moving around and such...butÂ a YEAR later? Maybe I am just hypersensitive and everything but just want to know what could be up or if this isn't unusual. You all were so helpful last year. Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "katiejaye wrote: I am just really worried right this second... On Tuesday I went in for my annual girl visit with a midwife at my hospital. She felt a lump in my left breast but told me I was pretty \"lumpy and bumpy\" and that she was relatively sure it was fibrocystic stuff. But to be safe she sent me on to the Breast Care Specialist. They happened to have an opening the next day, so I went and again another person was able to feel it. It is moveable and everything 6 cm fromt he nipple in the 3 o'clock position. But since 2 people felt it she suggested I go for a mammogram and u/s with a possible core needle biopsy. That appointment is tomorrow. She was very clear with me that she really didn't think it was anything bad, but to make me feel better she pulled some strings and got me in this week since my husband would be out of town next week and I have 2 small sons, 3 and 20 months with no family in town. I am 34 and I know my chest was bad and was told to cut out a lot of caffeine and such about 10 years ago. I am a week away from my cycle and with all my infertility issues in the past wouldn't be surprised at hormones from hell in there!!! What can I expect at this? I keep getting all teary and not really able to concentrate on what they are saying. What is a core needle biopsy? Why would I need this if it was fibrous? My mom (adopted) had breast cancer 3 different times over a 20 year period and ultimately died from it spreading to her bones and brain. They say I have age and such goingfor me, but at the same time I know that isn't really a true indicator. I am just really freaking out...any words of wisdom? Log in to post a reply",
