I was thinking it was pain in my lungs but I think it's actually nerve pain from the needle site. Did anyone else experience this? Ha, sorry I think I'm trying to keep you all talking to me :)",

I am 33 and waiting for breast core needle breast biopsy results on my right breast. I have a lump that apparently looks like a fibroadenoma but is bumpy. My doctor continues to tell me this is not an urgent matter and that the ultrasound and mammography results were nothing to be panicked about. I almost had to wait until next friday before receiving a biopsy but I called and begged them to try and find me something sooner. The radiologist from the biopsy said that it looked like a fibro and that she would tell me if it looked like something bad.  All this is not helping me. I am obssessively feeling my lymph nodes (which I have always been able to feel) and I'm worried I can feel them even more right now. I have been sick with worry, sleeping hasn't been easy. What is bothering me the most is the weight I have lost. (I quit eating bread last august and have slimmed down) but over the last week of worry I'm starting to feel uneasy about more recent weight loss since I've been worrying. When I am feeling less worried I am able to eat and I have an appetite. I'm very concerned about my weight loss and I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me/advice/similar experience they can share. I'm sorry if I sound like a nervous wreck right now but I am!!

On sunday night I had a severe anxiety attack and ended up in the urgent care clinic. I thought I was loosing my mind or that something was not right in my brain. They gave me some sleeping pills to help get rest. I called my doctor yesterday to make an appointment to talk about getting some anxiety medication for today (because I kept having these attack type things). She came in to the room and told me that my results are B9. It's a fibroadenoma. She told me that we should just wait and see if it goes away. I just had a miscarriage a couple weeks before this all happened so she thinks that when my hormones level out it might go away? I don't know if I will ask to have it taken out or not, it might be too invasive but at the same time it would feel good to have it out.  Thank you so much for your kind words and taking the time to help me feel better through all of this. I am so very thankful that I am ok for now and I will need to spend some time over the next while learning how to cope with uncertainty :) ",
