It seems to me that everycase is different, in my case even with the succesful response to chemo I am told that I am likely to live for 5 years but not 10yrs, The biggest side affect for me is that I get extremely tired so I usually go to be early but feel better when I get my 2 week break.  So the best way I find is to put this information into a small box and sit on it ..... then move on to living every day to the max. and do things that give you the feel good factor (fgf).  Sit and watch funny movies, I have 100 tips for immunity boosting and top of my list is laughter, whether that be smiling at a passing comment or watching funny movies but above all laughing with loved ones. So onwards and upwards my friend, one thing is for sure, we all live and we all die, its about enjoying the life we are given to give us all great memories. Good luck all",
