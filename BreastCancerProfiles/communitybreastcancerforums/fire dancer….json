I hope all goes well for you, these are hard choices re: what type of surgery you choose, but ask questions and know we are all here for you!",

I have had a great week...I went away with DH, saw many friends and family...went to see my favorite band preform, many dinners out, tried to \"seize the day\".  Well, now that I am back to reality I am officially scared.  I have been so busy this month and it was great to have the distraction, but now that I am 11 days away, I'm panicking.  I haven't changed my mind about surgery, but I am just plain scared of it.  I hear that once it's over the relief is amazing.  I look forward to that part, but I also wonder if I'll have regrets of sorts on the \"tough\" days.  My mind is whirling and I guess I won't know how I'll feel after till it's over.  Till then I am just trying to lay low.  We are seeing family for Thanksgiving, but overall I am pretty much entering the part of this journey where I am just focused on rest, staying healthy, and being with my little girls & husband. I guess I am trying to center myself for the road ahead.

This year is going to be tough, my DH and I always have a really big Christmas party, an \"open house\" of sorts...lots of people, cocktails, great apps...a big pot-luck with friends/fam...many of our friends really look forward to it because it is the one time of year that we can all count on seeing old friends and catching up.  Well, obviously this year that's not happening!  I just hope to keep the holiday spirit for my little girls, I was feeling lazy about the decorating-thing, thinking of keeping it simple (I go pretty big with classic-christmas decorating ) Reading about you getting ready has gotten me thinking I've got to get it going...I love sitting by the tree with the candles in the windows and the mantle all decorated, I think I'll start earlier than usual (thanksgiving wknd is my usual start).   Thanks for that motivation!!! Jane, I understand what you are talking about...I have the family history (mother/aunt/grandma) and feel like after watching  them, (my mom & aunt are alive...)  I feel like it's just a part of my DNA and this is my chance to beat  BC to the punch (hopefully...)...I must admit I always imagined it to be later in my life, I didn't expect to find out at 36 (all were diagnosed in early 50's) but I think because of how things have changed in early detection, I am blessed and lucky to kind of take control of really what I believ was my ultimate destiny...I know that there is still at least a 20% chance I have BC (aside from LCIS/ADH) but I just think that my relatives didn't have the opportunity to know at my age they were developing cancer. Laurie, I've heard of women having a \"party\" for the parting of their breasts...I'm kind of doing everything that makes me happy this month, I guess I am trying to spend as much time in my \"happy places\" with the people who make me feel good! And I definitley agree...we are taking care of business, thanks for reminding me! Get your zip-up sweatshirts, I just did, and check with your BS, I went to the BC surgical 'boutique\" in my hospital and they recommeded a certain bra that has pockets for the drains, but said to come back after surgery, BS sometimes write prescriptions for them.  It's worth finding out about if you can save the expense! I always look forward to everyone's posts on this thread, too!  I hope you all have a peaceful evening...be well & good night! btw, sorry for the \"wordy\" post",

I appreciate your stool softener advice,  really, after everything we are going thru, I am not sure there is much that is TMI !!! I have been checking out the thread about preparing for surgery and the info is helpful.  If you haven't seen it, maybe check it out!  I have been thinking about the whole recliner-thing and am tempted to have my husband just move it to the bedroom beforehand, it sure sounds like if you have one, that's the best place to rest, thanks for that! I hope the next few weeks go by smoothly for you, the anticipation is building for me, 3 weeks from yesterday, yikes!

This month is packed with friends and family, a massage with my sis-in-law, a few dinner plans with friends, a girls wknd at the casino, 2 more Dave Matthews concerts (up by me, no traveling), LOTS of alone-time with my husband, the kids are having time with the othe grandparennts as well to give us a chance to be alone and really savor this time before it gets crazy.And a lovely Thanksgiving with the extended fam.  In between all of this I am trying to sleep, work out and stay HEALTHY!!! I must add this is TOTALLY not a typical month...my great support system is trying to keep me busy with a \"carpe diem\" attitude! Zogo - thanks for organizing the dates! antenut: I feel for your concerns about anesthesia, I have never even broken a bone, let alone had surgery, I am definitley scared too.  I plan on requesting a little \"something\" when I get to the hospital, too.  We are strong women, but human, too...nerves can creep up.

Lastly, I wear some nice winter cardigan and casually button a few and it actually looks ok.  A scarf around my neck hanging in front hides my flat chest.  The other thing that worked great were \"V\" necked longsleeved  T's I bought at Marshalls or Target.  Big enough to get my arms & head thru, although by the end of the day I am sore as hell and need more assistance getting out of it than I did getting in it :-) With Christmas this week and busy times with the fam, I had to figure out how to get out of the house and not look \"sick\".  In fact, I highly advise going to the salon for a wash & blow-out, it worked wonders and my husband loved that he was off hair-duty...considering he is like Mr Mom right now!

It is amazing the difference a year make, huh?  I had BMX 12/06, implant exhange in March and just 6 weeks ago had Fat Grafting done on the divots on my upper chest pole.  I am finally satisfied with the cosmetic outcome.  I'll know if the FG \"took\" in a couple months and if everything looks the way I want it to, then I think I'm pretty much 'home free' - minus the yearly checkups, etc. I am starting to notice that since the roller coaster is over I am able to talk freely about BC.  I think I was so scared I kept it to only the people that needed to know, or that I was comfortable chatting with.  I can see things so differently now that I can step back and not be scared 24/7 ;-) I am starting to look for a part-time job...this was something I began when BC started, then I just made BC my job ;-) My kids are well-adjusted and we seem to be moving forward in a pretty great way.  I hope the rest of the December group is doing well - we've been through the wringer and I am wishing us all the best!",

Nanny62 - I thought I had a weird spot under my arm, I thought it was fluid but it was the TE where it had kind of moved, there was fluid trapped around it so it made it feel softer/more malleable.  I was also told hard, pea sized spots under my armpits would be swollen nodes.  I did have SNB but from what I'm gathering, swelling of other nodes is normal in the beginning. Take_two - I agree, I think I've got pretty good movement but am trying to still be mindful of not doing too much...these weeks are critical to moving on in the healing process and as difficult as it is, I'm REALLY trying to enjoy a more \"relaxed\" lifestyle, so weird when I am usually moving & grooving all day long...and I agree, very soon this will be something that happened last year!

I went today for aspiration of excess fluid buildup and instead got my 1st fill, PS said the sooner we fill, the less room there is for fluid buildup.  I am at 110 cc's as of today, another 60cc's on Tuesday and every week thereafter if I can handle it, till I get to my desired size, I'm thinking full 'B'...I'm 5'6 and 120 lbs, not alot of room for a big set ;-) I'm very excited to be starting this new chapter, it is uncomfortable but manageable...we'll see how I feel tomorrow!!! I hope this evening finds you all well, wishing good thoughts upon each of you!",

I've been doing quite well, my nipple-sparing BMX is healing great, my incsions seem to be doing fine, my pain is really minimal right now, I actually forget about the TE's alot of the day, of course they feel tight but I guess I am just getting used to this \"new\", although temporary -  me.  I go for a fill tomorrow.  I am at 270 cc's and am scheduled for 60 cc's more.  I missed a couple appts due to all this snow, so I am behind a bit.  I am contemplating asking if my PS will go a little more, like 100 cc's tomorrow, just to get back on track.  Who know's - either way I am glad right now to be feeling good, we'll see how I feel tomorrow !!! ;-) I've really been trying to get in some exercise, too.  I go to the gym 3 times a week and have been riding the bike about 10-15 miles each time, depending on my motivation ;-)  I was cleared for the bike about 3 weeks ago, so I have been really trying to make a point of NOT slacking too much.  I do my arm exercises from the PS while I ride to pass the time, I also sometime just hold 2 lb weights by my side just to remind me to engage my core and sit up straight.   I keep remembering something I read at the PS about standing tall, like a ballerina is great for you post-BMX, and considering I am a super-sloucher, this is probably good for me anyway!!! I really am not loving it, (at all) but I know that having some strength prior to BMX was helpful in recovery and I just don't want to lose it all before the exchange and I am out of exercise again for a month or longer. Hope everyone is staying warm, if you are experiencing this freezing weather - I am so all set with it now...snow today and MORE tomorrow...ugh! Be well, ladies!!!",

So glad nursing is going well, babies sure keep you busy, my girls are now 8&10, enjoy EVERY moment...although I'm pretty sure you are doing that already! :) Zogo, good job on the weight loss, hope everything goes great with reconstruction! Everything is good in my world, 12/6 is my 3- yr BMX anniversary and I will turn 40 that same day, there was a time I thought I'd dread the big \"40\" but it's pretty sweet nowadays! Enjoy the upcoming holidays and good to hear from you guys!",
