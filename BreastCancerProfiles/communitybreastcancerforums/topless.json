That said, yes, Tillycat, you should speak to her supervisor and let it be known that you were uncomfortable with this nurse's conversation and would rather not have her assigned to you again. The nurse needs to know that this was out of line and not her place to explore. She needs to ponder what she said and why she said it with the supervisor. The supervisor needs to know that this nurse may not be a good fit for this area of patient care and at the very least needs to be watched more carefully. After almost 30 yrs of nursing I have been in the same situation as the floor nurse and as a supervisor. Hopefully this incident will become a positive factor in this nurse's growth in her profession. Teaching goes both ways; nurses teach patients and patients teach nurses. You can be part of her education.",

All that happened in a short period of time and I still am not feeling good.  I haven't been able to restart my multiple sclerosis meds yet and when I do I will have to have a port put in surgically so that the IV med can be givin.   Sometimes I feel like I'm having flashbacks to that time and I wonder about a little PTSD going on here.  It's definately not been a good 4 months.  I still don't want to have sex and when we do it makes me so sad.  I'm tearing up right now. ",
