I've been down this road (cancer) before.  My DH was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when our son was only 5-months old.  Attitude is half the battle.  Not only that, I told him that I have first dibs on him so cancer better take a number. (LOL)  This is how I am looking at this ordeal too.  Yesterday I got a call from our life insurance agent stating that the increase in the life insurance benefit on me had been approved.  This morning I told my DH that I will be damn if he gets that money anytime soon!!! Like I said, attitude is half the battle.  When I was born (prematurely) I was in NICU for two weeks. The doctors gave me a 50-50 chance of making it.  Well... I am here and I am also going to fight tooth and nail to beat this illness (especially if it proves to be cancer).  WATCH OUT WORLD.... HERE COMES JO!!  ",

What are these actual lumps that my GP palpated on my breastplate and rib? Oh.... it is JUST my imagination, yes? I must be making up all of this BS?!?!  I told the nurse that I want to have a copy of the results sent to me.  I want to view this report myself. Granted I am happy to know that the bone scan is 'within limits'; however, I have been sick since July 1, 2006 and my doctors can NOT figure out what the hell is wrong with me.  Here's the reader's digest version. July 3, 2006... extremely sick. No fever, no swollen nodes, no sore throat, just extreme fatigue. WBC only 1000. I can't remember RBC. Excessive microscopic blood in urine. If WBC didn't come back up, trip hematologist. July 5, 2006... WBC up enough, no trip to hematologist. Hematuria remained. End of July 2006... Trip to urologist. 2 CT-IVP no stones or any other masses. Cyscopy performed. No tumors. Urologist stumped. August 3, 2006... Fired for being sick. Received unemployment benefits for 6 months. Unable to gain employment. Extremely depressed... prescribed \"happy pills\". Sept-Oct 2006... sent to allergist/immuniologist. T-cells and B-cells appear to be normal. No lymphoma or leukemia. Learned I am allergic to EVERYTHING though! Feb 8, 2007... my father died of heart attack/CHF in Cleveland OH. Feb 2007- Pap came back abnormal. Rechecked in couple of months. Normal.  Aug-Sept 2007... Heart issues. Tachycardia. Chest pains. EKG normal. Holter monitor test normal.  HB 127. BP okay. Oct 2007... Dx with hypothyroidism. Synthroid prescribed. Anemic. Blood tests done. Ruled out all anemias. Dr recommended iron supplements. Nov-Dec 2007... Chest pain- upper left side. Lump on breast plate found. Lump in left armpit. Prescribed meds. Lumps still present. Dr watching. March 2008... Chest pains again. Same side. Lumps (plural) found on breastplate and possibly 1st rib. Partial bone scan ordered. Results within limits. Severely anemic. Iron levels up, RBC down approx 1 pint. GP baffled.  Annual checkup. Lump found in left breast. OB/GYN ordered 'diagnostic mammo' scheduled for 21 March. April 2008... appt with ENT. Ear problems for several months now. Fluid behind drum. Hearing loss. Been through 3 antibiotics treatments. No improvement.      Don't get me wrong, I am happy with the bone scan results; however, I am extremely pissed that no one (drs) knows what the hell is going on with me.  My sister told me that I need to plan my funeral, because I am obviously dying of something! Insinuating that I am making all of these medical problems up. Asked GP... he stated that there are numerous medical issues compounded on top of one another; however he has yet to be able to figure out what's going on. Extremely frustrating!!!!",

On Monday I saw my GP on unrelated matters. While there I explained once again to him that I have had occasional dull pain upper left side for at least 3 wks and the lump on my breastplate and in the left armpit area still haven't gone away. During a previous appt months ago, he heard the same complaint about the lumps. Upon further evaluation from my GP on Monday, he palpated the upper left chest and noticed another possible lump on my breastplate and one on the first rib. He affirmed that the lump in the armpit has gotten bigger.  He ordered a partial bone scan. The bone scan was done yesterday. The results should be in sometime next week. During the bone scan the tech and radiologist were reviewing my scan periodically on the monitor. I overheard them talking about something that didn't look just right. They asked me if I had any recent injuries to the chest. None! So if that wasn't enough to make me worried, I had my annual exam with the OB/GYN today. During the breast exam, she found a rather large lump in my left breast. She took my fingers and had me feel it as well. She also looked at the lump in the left armpit.  I told her about the bone scan the day before. Well.... lo and behold, I am scheduled now for a \"diagnostic mammo\" on 21 March.  I have had a base line mammo at the age of 37, and have had a mammo every year since then that have all been 'normal'. The doctor thinks that it may be just a calcification if it wasn't on the mammo last year. She said this to calm me down since she knows of the history of breast cancer on my father's side. My father's sister had breast cancer that spread to her bones and her brain. She lost her fight.  Of course, I am extremely worried about all of these lumps both on the breastplate and rib, in the arm pit, and now this good size lump in my left breast. Waiting for results and/or medical tests are driving me crazy!!!!  Any suggestions??? Log in to post a reply",

Sometimes you just need a good cry to help you focus on whatever needs to be done.  Though it's hard, I try to remind myself that life is too short to worry about things that I have no control over. Enjoy life and those that are in it. Here are a couple of quotes that I came across last night that I would like to share. I hope you don't mind. \"Faith and doubt both are needed- not as antagonists, but working side by side- to take us around the unknown curve\" -Lillian Smith \"Faith. Hope. Love. They are three simple words, yet they sum up the things that lend life meaning.\" -Unknown \"... when life knocks you to your knees- well, that's the best position in which to pray, isn't it?\" -Ethel Barrymore",

I also have a decent sized lump in my left armpit.  BC runs in my family. I went to have a 'diagnostic mammogram' and an ultrasound on 12 March. Jokingly I told the techs that I didn't realize that I would be getting the \"spa treatment\". Needless to say, what they found was just a cyst. Thankfully. I too have had dull chest pains for several months as well as lumps on my breastplate and rib on left side. My Holter monitor result back in Sept '07 showed only a few irregularities. Heart disease is on both sides of my family. My father died in Feb '07 from a heart attack. My recent bone scan was 'within limits'.  So I completely understand the frustration and anxiety that you are feeling. I'm still awaiting my pap results. I hope that it comes back 'normal'. One of my aunts had cervical cancer. I have three strikes against me already.  My suggestion in the meantime is for you to use laughter as a stress reliever. That's what I do. Sitting around dwelling about the unknown is counter productive, and after all it could be nothing. However it is always good to have such things checked out.  Good luck to you! ",
