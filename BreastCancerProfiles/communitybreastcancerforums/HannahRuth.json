    "Content": "Jul 25, 2017 10:21AM - edited Jul 26, 2017 06:36AM by HannahRuth Hi, everybody. I will be having a bilateral mastectomy on August 1st without reconstruction. Although I'm still waiting for the results of a couple of tests, I am so very glad to have a plan for what happens next. It is easier to deal with this stage than it was to wait for the results of the core biopsy. My son is off to college three weeks after my surgery. I am hoping to have recovered enough to be there when he moves into his dorm room. :) Although he'll be about an 8-hour-drive away, my surgeon says she is OK with me going even if the drains are still in. (Do any of you know if this sounds at all feasible in reality?) I'm so glad to have found the support of this forum, and I'll be thinking good thoughts for all of you as you go through this process.",
