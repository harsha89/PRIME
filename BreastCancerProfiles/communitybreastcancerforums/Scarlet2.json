    "Content": "Nov 6, 2016 11:54PM - edited Nov 6, 2016 11:55PM by Scarlet2 Hi, I live in Uk, and would like some help re my Oncotype DX test result. I am Grade 2 Breast primary, 15mm - post menopausal, Her 2 neg ER positive. Sentinel node positive only. My result has come back at 19. I watched my sister go through hell before the end with chemo and I really struggle with the thought of it. Also, my husband has Motor Neurone disease (early stage PLS a form of ALS) and as you can imagine things will be difficult if I am out of action. The odds for me my Onc says are 8-20% recurrence after 5 years - this averaged out at 12%. Really cannot decide, I am due my pre-chemo assess this week. Any advice greatly appreciated, my Onc was very non committal, all he said was if it was a relative of mine I would suggest they have chemo, but because of our circumstances not a good comparison.
