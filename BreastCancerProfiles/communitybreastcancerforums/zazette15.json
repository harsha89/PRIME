Please do not wait any longer, I know you are scared, but you have to take care of yourself, if not for you, for your family (but it should be for you). I was scared too when I developed symptoms, before I went to the doctor, scared crazy, I know there was something wrong in my gut, and you know I would not be on this site if my gut had been wrong. But I reached, grabbed the set I grew, and got my butt to the doctors. I'm doing good, prognosis is good as long as I do what I'm supposed to and stay in this partnership with my doctors to save my life. You gotta go girlie. I am here for you.",
