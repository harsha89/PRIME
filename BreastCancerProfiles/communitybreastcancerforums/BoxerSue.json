Then T x12 once a week.  After the chemo I'll have a 4 week break and then radiation 5 x a week for 6 weeks.  I have to be at the oncology center at 12:30 for blood work, meet with onc doc at 1:00 and then the chemo begins at 1:30.  I have neulasta on Wednesday at 1:00. DH will be going with me - he's a doll.  I especially want him to hear all of the possible SE just so he knows what I may be feeling is real.  He went with me wig shopping Saturday and he made me buy 2.  One is so close to my color and style it's amazing.  The other one he actually picked for me - shoulder length - a bit darker than my current dye job and kind of sexy. He made this 57 year old feel kind of nice for a bit. My port is very iritating.  It is placed right near my bra strap.  I think I'm going to try to find a little stuffed pin cushion to place between the port and my bra strap. I'm just so anxious about the first drop of drugs hitting my body.  I know that after the first treatment I'll know more and hopefully my anxiety level will drop.  I'm thankful I've found this forum to share with all of you who know what I'm going thru.  Sometimes it feels so lonely. I wish I could wear my flannel pj's during my infusion - I dress up real good but I'm also into comfort when it's called for. Oh - the reason I'm BoxerSue?  Because I have 3 boxers, of course!!!  It's just me, my husband and our 3 fur babies. I'll try to post tomorrow night, depending on how I feel.",

And I am so angry with myself.  My onc nurse keeps telling me not to compare myself with everyone else but I just can't help it.  I am in tears right now.  My first Tx was 11/17. AC every 2 weeks for 4 TX.  Then 12 weekly TX of Taxol. I don't know if I can do this.  I've had no appetite since 11/18 - at this point just trying to stay hydrated.  The Cytolan headache will not go away.  They have given me hydrocodone which just makes me sleep.  When I'm awake and in an upright position the head hurts so badly - I can hardly see.  Onc nurse told me next Tx she will definitely drip Cytoxan over 90 mins. Nausea kicked in Friday night - the Emend worked until then.  I'm sure the empty stomach is not helping with the nausea but everything DH tries to make for me just makes me want to puke. I keep some saltines on hand and they do help a bit. I have no energy.  I am anemic and have been on iron tabs since a month before chemo began.  My numbers have not gone up.  Onc Doc said we may have to do iron infusions and that may help with my energy level. Yesterday morning I woke up with the hair on the left side of my head broken off and very frizzy.  I sleep on my left side so I guess that's why the left side was affected first. Note: even though I was an English major 50 million years ago I never could remember the difference between 'affected' and 'effected'. I have dropped 5 lbs since last Tuesday and that's not a good thing for me.  I've got to find something I can eat and keep down. I try to do a few things around the house so that everything is not on my husband.  I guess the main problem is my 84 year old mother lives with us.  She is heading into dementia and has not been a very nice person for the last year or so.  I don't know if she truly doesn't understand or chooses to act this way.  She does nothing but sit in her recliner 23 out of 24 hours a day.  She expects DH and I to wait on her hand and foot.  When she demanded that I do something for her yesterday and I told her I would get Larry she screamed at me that I was just lazy. And her ultimate put down yesterday was 'you look like you're 75 years old' - said in a nasty tone not a concerned tone. (I'm 57 and the picture you see of me was taken about 6 months ago)  Really made me feel good. Her doctors have told her, my uncle has told her, my husband has told her and I have told her what I am going thru.  It doesn't seem to matter.  I have one brother who is a total asshole.  Lives about 10 miles away and she sees him about 2 or 3 times a year - his birthday and Christmas - just when it's time for her to write him a check.  He can't even be bothered to remember her birthday - doesn't send a card - doesn't call.  He calls her once every 6 or 7 weeks and stays on the phone 3 or 4 minutes.  He has never once offered to take her off our hands for even a weekend - you see he's much, much too busy.  And of course my mother thinks he walks on water.  Little does she know the last time I called him to let him know she was in the hospital his response was \" Well is she dying? Because we're out on our boat with our friends and I can't get there until tomorrow\".   Oh yes - he does know I'm going thru chemo - my DH has a business relationship with my brother's mother-in-law and the woman's a big time gossip. Sorry - I'm just so down right now and this f-ing headache makes me want to crawl under a rock and die. I'm sure that rant was unnecessary. I'm so tired of well meaning friends telling me that so and so had chemo and they didn't have any problems.  Almost makes me feel that they don't believe me - which makes me stay away from them.  My Onc nurse told me to ask them where they got their medical degree from but I'm not an in your face type of person. I'm so sorry to be such a downer - I'm angry at my body - I went into this with the best possible attitude - and my body is betraying me.",

Melinda -  Yes, I had my first Tx on 11/17.  That was a Tuesday.  I have always worn my hair short anyway but on the following Sunday morning I woke up with the hair on the left side of my head broken off and very fuzzy.  I sleep on my left side.  I fussed with it on Sunday and Monday and it just upset me more and more.  So on Tuesday 11/24 my husband went with me to my hairdresser and she shaved it off for me.  It was very emotional - I wouldn't watch while she did it.  My dear husband pulled a chair close and held my hand.  He made jokes about having his head shaved when he went into the service.  I can't really remember what he was saying but he had me, my hairdresser and everyone else in the shop in stitches.  They both told me what a great head I had - no lump, no bumps.  I still wouldn't look at it - so we plopped my wig on my head and off we went.  Dear husband insisted that we stop for dinner.  I finally agreed - I just think he wanted to be with me the first time I wore the wig in public.  At home I have a couple of caps that I wear around the house - but back in the privacy of our bedroom I let it all hang out.  It's actually quite comfortable being 'nekkid' on top.  It did take me 2 or 3 days to actually look at myself in the mirror. Littlebird -  I'm thinking of you and praying, too.  Hope things get better very quickly.  I know I'm constantly taking my temp.  I'm glad you are in the hospital where they can get things under control. Still have the headache - although not nearly what it was. Wednesday before Thanksgiving I was so busy cooking and cleaning I wore myself out.  I started having numbness in my left thigh - between my hip and my knee - it just made my legs feel very weak.  That has pretty much come and gone since that day.  Last night I started with shooting pains in the lower part of my left leg - between the knee and the ankle - that's pretty painful and had me up most of the night.  Also, started with diarreha last Wednesday.  That's probably because I was tasting while I was cooking. Saturday I went shopping with a girlfriend.  We had a very good time but I could only stay out a couple of hours.  Yes, I was tired.  But what really got to me was all of the noise and the smells. Cafelovr - thanks for thinking of me - yes I do have TX #2 tomorrow.  Not looking forward to it, of course.  I'm going to remind my onc nurse that Cytoxan has to go 90 minutes NOT 30.  We'll see it that helps the headache.  I've lost about 5 lbs - not sure what they will say about that. Best of wishes to everyone this week.",

I actually had my second tx (AC) on 12/1.  I on the dose dense protocol.  So next tx is 12/15, then the last AC on 12/29 (Happy New Year!!!!)  I will start Taxol on 1/12 (every week for 12 weeks) and if everything stays on schedule I will have my last Taxol on 3/30.  Then on to radiation. I have no idea what SE I will face with the Taxol but I want this Cytoxan over with!!!!  For both tx so far I start with a headache while the Cytoxan is being dripped and the headache lasts for about 12 days - I have 2 good days and then the next tx.  The onc doc gave me vicodan - 2 every 4 hours if I want but if I do that I just sleep.  I have to try to do a few things around the house so everything does not fall on my hubby. With the headaches comes noise sensitivity, my eyes are sensitive to bright lights and the smells - omg the smells. I was actually feeling semi-human yesterday afternoon so I decided to go to the Look Good Feel Better program at our local hospital last night.  It's a wonderful program but I should not have gone.  The lights in the room were very harsh - if I had my sunglasses I would have put them on.  The woman giving the presentation is a lovely woman but I found her voice to be very grating.  Prior to chemo I know it wouldn't have bothered me a bit.  Everyone gets a bunch a products that have been donated by various cosmetic companies - no one's bag of products are the same.  When everyone started opening various skin cleansers, moisturizers, etc the smell was overwhelming to me.  It was me, not the program.  I had to leave.  I probably looked like a real ass but I did try to quietly tell the lady that I had to leave and why .  But quiet was not in her repetoire.  I think most of the other women had not started chemo yet and I really didn't want to scare/upset anyone.  I couldn't get out of that building fast enough into the fresh air. Drove home with the car windows all the way down - about 35 degrees outside.  It took me hours to get the perfumey smells out of my nose.  And of course, the headache which had been dull came back full force.  It's a wonderful program but just wasn't for me last night. I'm going to try to do a bit of Christmas shopping this weekend.  Nobody had better come near me with a perfume spritzer or I just might do my best impression of a mad, insane woman!!!  I'm doing some bruising - seems to be on the same side as my port.  And for the life of me I don't remember walking into anything - they just appear!! I'm using the Emend.  And although my insurance is covering the whole cost of it thru the end of the year (we hit our catastrophic limit around the middle of October) I was shocked to see the cost.  Three pills should not cost that much. I'm not sure I really know what nausea is.  Never been pregnant.  All I know is nothing appeals to me.  I've only thrown up twice - once with each tx.  But nothing appeals to me.  My dear husband will get me anything I want to eat but I want nothing.  And when I do think something might appeal to me I take 2 or 3 bites and I'm done.   Of course, my three boxers have learned very quickly to sit by me during meals!!!!! I feel so badly for my husband because he is trying so hard.  At this point I'm just trying to stay hydrated.  Now today my mouth is on fire.  Just burning like I had some nice hot wings.  I've been rinsing with water but nothing takes the fire away. And my dear 84 year old mother asks me about every 2 or 3 hours if my hair is growing back!  I'm trying so hard to hold onto my patience with her.  She can't help it, she's well into dementia. I hate that all I do is bitch and moan when I'm here.  I just want to feel better.  I had hoped to go to Florida for some dogshows after the first of the year but I don't think that's going to be in the books.  I'll send my little boxer girl with her handler and HOPE that she gets that one last win she needs to finish her championship.  Silly, isn't it?  I'm worried about a dogshow when I'm doing this chemo thing.  Guess I have to have some diversion!! Hope everyone's side effects are better tomorrow!  Feel like I need to start singing that song from Annie -  Tomorrow, Tomorrow.....",

The diarrhea has finally stopped but that's probably because I can't seem to tolerate eating anything.  I'm trying to stay hydrated.  I'm taking the Emend so I can't really say I'm nauseous just have no interest in any food. This damn Cytoxan headache just won't go away.  My onc nurse suggested sudafed -the one where you have to show your driver's liscence and sign your life away.  I took it and an atavan when I got home and managed a few hours of sleep.  Took it again last night and slept off and on last night.  I would wake up and say just get up and do something.  The brain was willing but the body said 'no way'. I just made myself get up and feed the dogs.  But being in an upright position brought the headache back.  So I'm going back to bed as soon as I finish here.

Then I met with the onc doc and I cried again.  I just love this man.  He told me go ahead and cry - it was totally normal. They started me on iv fluids and then I waited for the blood work results to come back.  Then they started me on 2 separate nausea drugs hung one after the other.  Then she came at me with 3 huge tubes of the red stuff (the A in the AC).  She did that as an IV push - I assume so that she could control the speed.  Within a few minutes I did get a dry mouth and a weird sensation in the back of my throat.  At that point she told me to take the emend.  About 20 minutes later I started getting a weird sensation in my stomach - a tightness is the way I explained it.  Things started rumbling - but I never did throw up. She gave me about a ten minute break.  Then she started the Cytoxan.  Talk about major headache - then my eyes hurt like hell - and then my checkbones.  She brought me some tylenol but that really didn't touch it. After we left I felt like I was in a daze (and still do this morning).  We stopped at the pharmacy on the way home last night and I was stumbling over a bunch of words.  Just how soon does this chemo brain stuff kick in?  I didn't think it would be this fast. I took the atavan last night and it did help me go to sleep but I sure didn't stay asleep. JustnAlici - I also had low temperature last night (94.2 when I checked at 2 a.m.)  Right now it's 96.4 so a bit better.  I'm the one who can't stand a warm house but I've got the thermostat jacked up right now. I have to go for the Neulasta today at 1.  I'm going to drive myself.  Hope it's not a mistake but DH has tons of accounts to see today - yesterday's and today's. Hope everyone is doing well.  I have to say my boxer boy (who is very sensitive to me) wanted to stick so close to me last night.  He knew that I was not feeling well. Good luck to all of those with upcomming TXs.",
