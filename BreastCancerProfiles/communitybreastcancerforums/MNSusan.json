I did nearly five years of tamox the first time around.  My MO wants me to take it again but I've declined.  I suggested to her that maybe I'm one of those women that doesn't metabolize it well and her response was \"just because you don't metabolize it well doesn't mean it isn't effective.\"  Huh?  Anyway, I'm one of the VERY few that had just about every side effect listed and they continued even after I changed to an AI.  When my granddaughter said to me, \"I'd rather see you go through chemo than take that drug again,\" it really hit me how much my personality changed while I was on it.  My MO finally conceded that quality of life issues should be taken into consideration and sort of supports my decision. ",

They all (ages 34-42) have their own families and lives and I didn't want to have them asking me a bunch of questions I didn't have the answers to. Once I knew what I was going to do and when, we let them know. It was stressful for sure, but knowing my kids would be stressed out and not be able to comfort them was too much to add to the mix. \"Don't go there until you get there\" is a great thing to remember. I also like \"Don't bleed till you're shot.\" I spent a lot of time here waiting, waiting, waiting. Sending hugs your way!",
