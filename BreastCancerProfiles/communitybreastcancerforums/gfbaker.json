If money is an issue and you are brave, you can try the first one without and see how it goes. They can always prescribe it later if needed.  Good luck, chemo is not fun but it is doable.",

Adriamycin can really eat up your veins, and if you have had lymph node removal then you are probably down to one arm for future draws. I did AC then Taxol and had a port. It really is not so bad and my veins are still good. Also, ask about Emend, its a nausea drug that can really help. My first dose I didn't get it and I was a pukey sick mess for 3 days. With it, tired, not hungry but stomach was calm. Expensive as all heck but insurance should cover it. Hugs, Gayle",

Chemo usually does put you in early meno, but you can come out of it, as I did after a year. And I don't think you can take tamox while you are pregnant, so you would have to go without further treatment until you get pregnant and have your baby. I had my kids close together, and when my 2nd was 10 months old, I was diagnosed. I am convinced that having 2 kids close together (19 months apart) was what made my cancer go crazy - I'm er/pr+ too. Some women who find out that they have cancer & pregnant can do chemo after the 1st trimester. I don't know if this is something you can consider too. I would find an onc/gyn and discuss all your options so you can make the best decision for yourself. Good luck!",

In fact, the latest studies indicate better control of lymphadema with weight training and having strong arms. But right now, you need to take it easy and work on getting the swelling down. I wore special garments, kind of like wrapping, to get the swelling down, compression garments only hold you where you are. I wouldn't even buy one just yet until you get to a good stable arm, ie as close to your other arm as they see possible. The LE PT should teach you how to massage your lymph system and give you gentle stretches to resolve the cording. Once you have that, you can work up from there.",

Like only 1 in 10 women who get a diagnostic mammo have cancer. Getting yourself checked is smart, and will hopefully be benign. You shouldn't just get a letter in the mail. This is a diagnostic exam, not a routine, and so they will call it over to your gyn who ordered it, and then they will call you or have you come in to discuss. As for the genetic thing, your mom's onc can't & won't discuss another patient's records, even if it is your mom. What you can do, following your mammo is make an appointment with a genetic councelor. They can discuss your risk factor, and if it is high enough, then your insurance should pay for you to get tested for BRCA 1/2. Let us know how it goes for you.",

I was 38 when I was diagnosed and we didn't even bother with oncotype. My understanding is that it is not an effective test for those under 40. It is not an easy decision to make, but getting more info so you can make an informed decision for yourself is a good thing. Best of luck with the rest of your treatment, what ever that may be.",

Maybe there is something like that in your area? If not, a massage therapist who is trained in pregnancy massage might be a good choice because they know how to adjust massage well. I get a massage every month - I consider it a necessity. Best of luck finding someone who meets your needs!",

I think that if they add the red devil in your next treatment, the rest of your hair will fall out at that point. My hair took 7 full days to fall out, and I looked really weird until it was all gone, so I was glad to go bald. But it did start growing back in during taxol. My leg hair kept growing all through treatment, so you just never know what is going to happen.",
