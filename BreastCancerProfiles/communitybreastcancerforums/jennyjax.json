LOL! anyway, she said if you feel up to it, it's ok to drink occasionally. she did recommend folic acid supplement, though. i have had maybe 2 glasses of wine since starting chemo Nov 3, but honestly it just doesn't taste all that good to me right now.",

I'm getting adriamycin/cytoxan every other week x 4 rounds, followed by weekly taxol x 12. I, so far, have had minimal side effects. I have been diligent about the water drinking...even on the 2 days post chemo when I don't feel right. After my first AC, I literally had almost zero SE's. The next round was on 11/17, and I must say I was fairly queasy off and on for at least 2 days post, and certain smells really gagged me, but by day 3 in the afternoon I was coming back! I get neulasta shot 24 hrs post chemo. I've been taking claritin the day of shot and 4 days after....not a single bone pain! I go in for AC #3 this Monday, Dec 1- I pray it goes as well as the first 2. I must say, it is so true that all of this is going much faster and easier than I anticipated. I sure hope that continues...the holidays def help! I'm beginning to get a little touch of cabin fever, as I have really been staying very close to home to avoid all the germs this time of year. I keep telling myself this is a short amount of time in the big picture, and there will be plenty of time after it's all said and done to make up anything I have missed! Overall, this diagnosis has already changed me for the better- I have def re-prioritized things in my life, have learned to not sweat the small stuff, and generally have realized all any of us have is the present moment...so make the most of it! I am sorry that any of us are on this forum, but at the same time, what a wonderful blessing! Cheers to each of you! We CAN and we WILL get through this, and will be all the better for it! ",

I asked my doctor, and he said it was fine to take it, but he didn't know if it would help or not. So far, I haven't had a single pain! I will continue with claritin!",
