    "Content": "TooYoungforThis wrote: I'm sure its on here somewhere but there is a lot of postings. Last January I was diagnosed with triple negative stage three BC. My treatment plan was chemo first then surgery then radiation after. My monthly flow disappeared a month after. It stayed away until the first of this month. I had spotting (very light for me)I for a week. Then four days ago I started a light flow again. Today was a very heavy day. My question is does it ever balance back out? I have an apt with my oncology doctor tomorrow for a follow up. Should I be concerned or is this a normal happening? Log in to post a reply",
