Since I only have one node involved and no primary tumor, I will not have to have Chemo. However, I will need radiation and estrogen suppressing pills. My Tumor Board Second Opinion thinks that my immune system fought off the primary cancer. My Sentinel Node has shown up on the Mammogram for two years, and remained the same size. The Mammogram Lab felt the node was benign.  Finally it was biopsied and low and behold, Cancer.  So, not to alarm you, I would suggest a biopsy be done. When my other nodes were removed in my operation they were inflamed, but in hind-sight they may have been that way because of the biopsy, but on never knows.  All of them could have been cancerous.  I will keep my fingers crossed that if you are biopsied the node is just doing it's job and fighting off infection.",
