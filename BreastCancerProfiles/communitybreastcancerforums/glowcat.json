After finishing my chemo, Herceptin and radiaton my hair grew back thick and curly. Never had curls before. Yes it is true that all 3 of these meds make you hair fall out but what is the alternative. I guess we just have to live with this depressing fact as it is better than a re-occurance of BC. One thing you can try is Joico Foam - it makes my hair look 5x thicker and it's easy to use. You can obtain it on the internet and it's only abt $11.00. Wonder foam!",

Started taking Femara 6 months ago and have lost 1/2 my hair and it is still falling out. I called Novartis today to ask what to do but they said it's the Femara and they don't know how long it will be before it stops. Or I may be wearing a wig again. The 3 drugs for HER2 positive bc all cause hair to fall out. Sorry to give bad news but this is a fact. God bless all.",
