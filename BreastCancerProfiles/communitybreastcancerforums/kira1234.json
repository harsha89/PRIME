This is what has me wondering if I should just tell the BS to just do a double masectomy before the cancer gets much worse. Karen",

Do you have any idea when you might begin the Mammosite radiation.  I will also be suing something  very similar to it called the Contura balloon.  I'll be starting it on the 26th. As far as chemo my Dr.'s feel if my onctype number is low it isn't worth it for me because of the severe side effects at my age. I will be starting hormone therapy right away either way. World Watcher, I'm sorry your experience with the Sentinal Node biopsy was bad.  My BS used some kind if numming agent right in the needle with the radioactive dye.  I didn't feel a thing, I was asleep when the blue dye was added later on.  I wish all hospitals and BS could agree on how to do this procedure.

Sadly at this time these seems to be nothing else the \"authorities\" are using to decide if the cancer has spread or not.  So with that knowldege in mind Otter, I am kind of leaning towards telling the BS SNB only. If the cancer has spread to the LNS then I know I need radiation and cemo, and will very likely have a mastecomy as well. I do thank all of you for the info given, and Kira thanks for the info about the care I  will be following the advice given after the surgery.  If anyone has anymore advice or suggestions please let me know, as I said Wednesday at 10:00 I will have surgery so my time for decisions is fast approaching.

The 5 days were long with 2 treatments daily, but I recoved very quickly. During that week I went shopping at the mall with my daughter, and went out to eat several times. I would say the device that extends outside of the body was about the only thing I didn't like, it was a bit of a pain. I had the catheter placed 3 weeks later, and it was quite easy to place using just a local in the BS. office. I had no problem with infection, the device was taken care of by the nurse after each treatment. By the way I'm 57, and my BS thought because of my age this was a good choice for me.",

I'm sure the reason your Mo is pushing chemo is because shall we say the horse is out of the barn with so many nodes involved. They are hoping to save your life, but ultimately it is you decision who you trust. I might add my 79 year old mother went through chemo in 05, and did fine with it, just tired and sad.",

I got something called radiation recall from the chemo, but since it was internal it burned from the inside out. The onc's opinion was she wanted nothing to do with the situation, so basically don't talk to me. I guess it went before some review as I was told by the BS yesterday I was very unusual, but they would never do chemo so soon after radiation again. By the way had no problem with the contra device or infection. I had almost completely healed. It looked great, and the BS had done a very good job. By the way the only thing holding the incision together now is radiation scar tissue, so very week, and must be treated with care.",

In her case the chemo itself killed her. She was never able to receive the bone marrow her system just shut down. The entire thing left a very bad taste in my DH's mouth. He was so afraid the same would happen to me with my chemo treatment. It is really sad my reaction to the chemo was as sever as it was it only added to his fears.",

In my case the reexision was just to get better margins, actually in my case wide margins. I'm also a stage 1b, and my BS easily took that much tissue if not more. He removed about a tennis ball size from me. Just to add I didn't have vascular invasion involved, Ibut i think it means there is blood being supplied to the tumor.",

My mother had it done a few years ago before they had another choice. I saw her suffer daily with the lyphodemia. It was something I was not willing to even consider. I was even considering not having the SNB done for fear of the pain. It took many very kind people on this site to convince me to even have the SNB done, and I am so thankful they were willing to give me the help I needed at the time. Please listen to them they have so much more experience than I. Karen",
