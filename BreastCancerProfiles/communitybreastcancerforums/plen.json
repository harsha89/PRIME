Because I had a history of cancer in the family and had already had numerous surgeries for benign breast tumors and been diagnosed previously with LCIS I knew as soon as I heard the report that I wanted a bilateral mastectomy. My surgeon insisted that I get a second opinion which I did (even though I knew what I would do). I asked the second surgeon if he thought I was crazy and he said maybe I was but not for this decision.  I did it 6 years ago and have never regretted it. I still worry occasionally just because of my family hx  - mother had it and my sister is in stage IV - but it doesn't consume me as it would if I had not made the decision I did.
