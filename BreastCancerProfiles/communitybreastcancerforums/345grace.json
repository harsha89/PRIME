Maybe just scared, angry, all that. I wish I could get on, even on TV- there are cancer stories 2-3 times daily.  This seems to be an epidemic. It is a beautiful day here in Arkansas.

The harshness of this disease has given me a gentleness toward life that I had only dreamed of having.  Does that make sense? Winter fall like day today, cloudy 50, some rain.  I love gardening, cooking, even grocery shopping.  Am very grateful to be able to do these things.  Thank you all.  Oh,-Diana - will be at the Komen race in Little Rock on Saturday.  My first such event. Whooppee.",

Maybe today, maybe next week.  I understand there is a 'window' of time - to keep the cells at bay. Even with all the pain bones and joints, swelling - I am feeling lots better not taking these hormone drugs.  I am eating, sleeping, thinking - better for sure.  I am so undecided - at this moment - on the quality versus the quantity of my life. Again, thank you all for your words. ",
