ADM, cadaver tissue, looks like human, eliminates the mastectomy scar(s) and all is completed within 3 months. Very few Surgeons do this and had heard of it but thought it meant simply an interior sling. Could have had the same size or much larger breasts in a much shorter period with a much greater success without likely complications. However I am over 50 so perhaps it is not as meaningful, in terms of cosmetic enhancement.",

The whole procedure done in under 3 months. She is currently 53 and a large woman. My sister saw the scar and said it was hardly evident except the skin was of a slightly lighter tone where she was expanded. Interesting?",

Not so much, of endometrial cancer, because that is apparently only a 14% likelihood, more likely, 60% I have hyperplasia, probably with atypia. And even though only 30% will proceed to endometrial cancer I do not want a hysterectomy. Nor do not want to now start Femara because I can no longer take Tamoxifen as I have osteopenia.

I am always reassured when I visit the board and am so fortunate. Nonetheless, visits here often reveal a new aspect of concern. Cancer life seems to me to be always double edged like a very sharp knife. In the research news section I just read the result summary of the BIG 1-98 trial, \"Femara better than Tamoxifen\" comparing the 324 lobular to 2599 ductal cancers registered with this study on their 8 year disease free rate. It found only a 66% disease free rate for lobulars compared to a 75% for ductals, for those prescibed tamoxifen only. I am currently taking Tamoxifen. The good news is that Femara increases the disease free rate over 8 years to 75% for lobular patients. Great, my treatment plan was to do 2 years Tamoxifen and 3 years Femara. I see my oncologist in a couple of weeks. I wonder if she will be switching me early. However, I am not excited over the prospect of side effect pains, arthritic and/or joint pain, particularly for us with existing pains, when using these new drugs. I do as I am told. I would really like to see seventy.",
