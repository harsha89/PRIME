Is this basically just combining the two procedures? I am assuming this will hurt some and be distressing to me. Can someone walk me through what will most likely happen?

It seems like stirring up trouble to be poking around in cancerous cells and might possibly be setting them loose to be spread. I know I am worrying. I had cancer once. Had a mastectomy. Now I just had a couple biopsies in the other breast and It is so bloody and painful. I am so tired. I know I am imagining cancer being spread into my bloodstream and lymph vessels. Can that happen? It's ok. Tell me I am crazy! Log in to post a reply",
