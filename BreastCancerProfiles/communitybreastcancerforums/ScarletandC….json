They couldn't locate the spot in order to do the stereotactic biopsy. 2 hours, 22 views, it only showed up on one. The radiologist was great, but she said she just didn't feel good about trying to find something she can't see. She's setting up an appointment for me with one of their breast surgeons to look at the multitude of images done today and over the last few weeks. Whatever this is doesn't show up at all on the old mammograms, and doesn't show up on ultrasound. Just on the 3D imager and then only from one angle, with my poor old boob twisted around like the lid on a pickle jar. She says the surgeon will help me decide if a needle-guided biopsy is the way to go, or if she wants to wait 6 months, do another set of images then and see if anything has changed. I wish this was some sort of answer for me, but I guess like a lot of us, it's hurry up and wait for a bit again. Love to you for the kind words and thoughts, they mean the world to me.",
