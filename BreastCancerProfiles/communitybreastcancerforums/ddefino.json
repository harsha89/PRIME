So i am assuming they think the worst and are going to try to do ther ebest not to worry us until they have too.  The surgeon also said what struck me odd after putitng the port in was that he couldn't believe she survived the last one eight years ago.  So ia assuming what they know isnt that good.",

She had the samething 8 years ago she went through chemo, surgery then radiation.  Let me tell you she was running around and doing stuff and never missed a beat.  Ok so this time she hadnt been feeling good for a couple months finally she came out and said she had IBC againa nd it was a new cell in her good breast.  Of course it's been 8 years mom is older now and this time it aint is easy.  She is having this fluid in pleural area i bleive is by the lungs.  She has had to get drained 4 times now.  Her first chemo they did wa ssuppose to get rid of fluid but that chemo didnt work.  he changed it to Navelbine i beleive and now the problem with that it is messing wit her white blood count and she can not get chemo whenn blood count is all jacked up.  The doctor said thta the cancer has moved to the chest area. So she has IBC it spread to chest are he said he can only try to control the cancer.  My mom is on 2 liters of oxygen 24/7 and is weak she doesnt eat alot but i guess that is normal.  I am wondering why wont they do anothe rpet scan and see what is going on.  From the first time they said she has IBC it hadbt spread but now he says it has according to the fluid thy have drained out from her it was tested and came back with cancer.  So does she have lung cancer now with IBC and if so why dont they just come out and tell us.  If she didnt have oxygen her level would be low with it it is like 93 still not great.  Dont u think they should do a pet scan again and stop dinking around.  My sister an di are just so confused.  The surgeon who put her port in said he kept hitting something int here when he was putitng port in.. What the hell does thta mean he thinks its tumor.  Well hell if thats the case what is her onocologist freaking doing seems like he is moving slow for an aggressive cancer please help..

Only if u all knew my mom she is real personal and doesn't want her kids to worry. Liek i always say to her mom u had us and took care of us and now thta i'm 35 and your sick its my job to take care of u so get over it.  I mean there has to be some point where she asked the doctor like hey what is going to happen or hey this is in my chest wall can u do a pet scan to see where else it is so i can deterimne how i wan to live my life.  I feel so bad for her but yet its her life and its up to her.",
