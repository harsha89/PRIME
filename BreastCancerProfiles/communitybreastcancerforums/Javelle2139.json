      "Content": "Javelle2139 wrote: So, a few weeks ago I noticed a lump in my breast because I do monthly breast exams. I wasn't too concerned as I have had lumps before, but then I noticed pain specifically where the lump is. Then, it spread to my armpit, and now my collarbone. I went to the doctor, and she said she wasn't too concerned and to see me in 3 weeks. Well, just the other night I have now discovered a lump right about my collarbone, and my lymph nodes in my neck are starting to swell up as well. I have not had any discharge or anything like that. Is this concerning? It is only in my left breast, and to me it only seems to be getting worse. Log in to post a reply",
