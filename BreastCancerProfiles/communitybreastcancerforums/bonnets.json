If I reach wrong, turn wrong, have a difficult BM, I can have awful pain in my ribs on the lumpectomy side. I tend to worry cuz I had a daughter who passed at 33 from BC. Also my surgery was on the lower inner quadrant, closer to the ribs. Been 2 years since I finished rads. I have been reading of others who are experiencing various pains on that side, for years, but I did want to make sure! Pray you have a good result too. Hate waiting!",
