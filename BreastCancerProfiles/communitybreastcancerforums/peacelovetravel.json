It's not sore, and also small and oval shaped. I'm 20 years old and healthy, so I didn't panic - but nonetheless got it checked to be sure as I have been taking the contraceptive pill (ovranette), and know this can increase the risk of breast problems slightly. Doctor said not to worry but that she would refer me to a breast clinic just to be safe. I'm still waiting for my app, and haven\u2019t been too concerned but this morning I noticed that the lymph nodes in my right armpit have become enlarged and tender, and they weren't when the doctor examined me. I don't have any infection that I know of, and lymph nodes in neck are normal. Just wondering if anyone can shed some light on whether they think this could be something serious or not. Hate the waiting game Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
