The top part did not feel attached and fungus grew in. I considered having them removed but doc said to let RX work. I kept them cut short and continued to use the RX. This past summer they looked a little better so I let the manicurist start using the sanding tool. I can finally wear most of my shoes without any discomfort. Sorry I do not have better news.",

I lost a little one and both of the big ones started to detach. All of this happened PFC. I finally went to dermatologist. She cut them down as far as possible and gave me expensive RX. Fortunately it was summertime so I could wear sandals. My big toe nails had always been thick and I did not realize that something was wrong. It took about a year to completely correct. I get pedicures about once a month from person I trust. I started taking Biotin during chemo. My fingernails are better than they were before chemo and my hair is very thick. I am 2 years PFC and I have most of the original length back. I do not know if it has the same texture because I used to keep it straight with either heat or chemicals. Now I wear it natural. I no longer use dryers, curling irons, flat irons, hot combs or relaxers. I cannot be sure if the Biotin has contributed to the successful growth of my hair and nails, but I do not plan to stop taking it until I can pull my hair back into my normal summer poneytail. I had color resistant grey hair before chemo and now it is worse. I continue to use permanent hair color because the others do not work.            ",

I was on taxatere so the fuzz had been growing for a few weeks. It continued to grow slowly and fill in. By 10/15/13 my hair was like Carrol2 at 13 weeks but mine was all white.  Eventually silver and a few random dark hairs joined in.  By 2/15/14 (6 mos PFC) it looked like Carrol2 at 23 weeks (still white and gray).  Friends and family had been recommending all kinds of oils and treatments.  One person recommended a shampoo with protein.  I had been taking biotin since Sept.  I had another surgery in on 2/15 and started adding protein powder to my smoothies to improve healing.  I began making more green drinks and smoothies and continued adding the protein powder..I usually have it 2 or 3 times a week.  Now, after 3 months my is significantly thicker and  and most of it has grown 2 inches. Since I hated the white hair I began experimenting with henna since it is non toxic.  Unfortunately it does not work very well on stubborn white hair.  ",

After the lumpectomy we discovered that I needed chemo because the bc had spread to a couple of nodes.  Bummer.  At that time I started doing research about causes, treatments and prevention.  BC runs in my family.  My mom, 2 of her sisters and one of my sisters had BC.  None of them drank or smoke.  In fact, I don't think that mom or her sisters ever indulged. My sister probably indugled during the 1970's but that was 30 years ago.  I smoked for 35 years and stopped 2 years ago.  I am primarily a social drinker who enjoys wine and \"girlie drinks\".  I don't think that a change in lifestyle could have prevented my getting bc because of my family history.   When I started chemo I tried to change diet by increasing veggies and decreasing processed foods.  I did eliminate alcohol durng the 6 months that I was taking chemo.  I did not want my liver to have to work too hard while cleaning chemo out of my system.  I felt that it was a small sacrifice.  However, my diet went to hell because the chemo screwed up my appetite and taste buds.  I had BMX and DIEP in October.  I could not eat large meals but I focused on lean protein and veggies in order to recover.  When I recovered it was the holdiday season again. I have learned I cannot just stop anything at one time.  I want to eat beter and exercise more to be healthy overall.  We cannot just focus on BC.  I will however still have a slice of birthday cake or an occasional burger. ",
