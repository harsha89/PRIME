Still have the cheap balloon in, but have to go back to surgery 3/3 for more tissure to be removed because the margins weren't clear.. Guess he didn't take enough the first time ??  Has anyone had to do this?? Not happy about going to surgery, but trying to keep positive. It puts the radiation off. Wonder if I will even be able to have it? nanamom",
