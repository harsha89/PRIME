History - Oct 07, rt breast biopsy and lumpectoy for an abnormal/precancer lump, 1 cm. April 16, 08 - left breast this time, biopsy dx comes back with cancer, surgeon says stage 1, e+, p+, her-(or whatever those letters were).  Order mri, bone scan, blood tests, chest x-ray and sends me to a breast navigator.  No one tells me anything.  Next he sends me to an onocologist who shows me a video and wants me to sign for a lumpectomy with that ballon type radiation even though surgeon said earlier that I had choices of this, lumpectomy with rad or masectomy with rad.  I ask onc about results from all the tests.  He says that he hasn't even looked at them.  I question him some more and he got upset.  He pushed himself back in his chair, threw his hands behind his head and said, \"This is the United States.  I guess you have a right to choose anything you want.  It's your life.\" I cried and walked out.  My husband came home from work and demanded a second opinion.  He called and had all my work transferred to this big Cancer Institute about 90 minutes away from us.  They finally got half my paper work.  I have to run around picking up films before I go there but they can't even fit me in with a nurse until June 30. What am I suppose to do?  Why can't someone just tell me what my tests show?  I'm ready to just quit and die or cut my own boobs off.  I can't stand the running around any more. Does anyone else feel this way?  How do you get through the waiting?  Do you worry that too much time is passing by?  Are you feeling more tender as the days go by?  Can you actually notice the difference in size since you first felt the lump? Does anyone ever finally come right out and tell you the truth?  What is the next step and when should I expect it? Dx 5/16/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

How do you feel?  Are you off the pain meds and feeling strong enough to grip the wheel and alert enough to respond to an emergency? ControlMyDestiny... it sounds like you have been through a lot in a short time.  My situation was so opposite.  It took 5 weeks from diagnosis to finally scheduling a mastectomy.  I was freaking out.  I could swear I felt that bugger growing every day.  (invasive ductal carcinoma)  But as for now, like you, I'm waiting for the next tests.  Come what may, our faith will lead us where we need to be.  I wish you all the best. As for me... I need more time to absorb all that is happening.  I'll check the boards again in a few days.  Stay well everyone.  Believe it or not I think of you this list rather often.  I have learned a great deal here... and have blown off a little steam too (thanks for letting me do that).  Hugs, Kym",

Am I doing something that is causing so much fluid?  Should I be relaxing more and working less?  I'm running a farm so I have to work somewhat.  If I hire out some help and take the time to just sit around would my drainage lessen/healing quicken? I need a shower! Kym",
