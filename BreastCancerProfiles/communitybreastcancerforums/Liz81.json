It took them an hour of trying to get good pictures until they decided that they needed my arm to go through the whole too. Once this was done I was out in a total of 2 hours. My calcifications were straight down from the nipple up against the chest wall. So they had to stick the needle in from the side of my breast up against the chest wall. It was taking them so long I was worried that they would never be able to line up the needle. I did not let on that I was worried, I just kept telling them to take their time. I wanted them to do a good job and not rush. The procedure would have been faster if my calcifications were near the surface.",
