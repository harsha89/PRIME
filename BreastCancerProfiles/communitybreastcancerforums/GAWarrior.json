      "Content": "Apr 14, 2018 07:23PM - edited Apr 14, 2018 07:25PM by GAWarrior Djt, you're welcome! Yes, TC is the type of chemo - as far as I understand it T is either Taxol or Taxotere (they prevent cancer cells from dividing) and C is Cytoxan (interferes with cellular metabolism and growth). I got a nifty book from the hospital system where I'm having my procedures - everything about cancer, not that you wanted to know it, lol. The American Cancer Society has great info if you go here: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer.html. Also, they offer phone or in-person support: https://www.cancer.org/treatment/support-programs-... RE your heart: I had an echo cardiogram done yesterday. They do this before you start chemo so they have your baseline. The tech told me I will see him often during chemo because the oncologist and cardiologists will keep a close watch and adjust the chemo meds if my heart starts to show effects. I have the occasional racing heart, too, which I noted on their health history forms. I would think (hope) your oncologist would order this for you. If he/she doesn't - REQUEST IT! You are your own best advocate and you have to watch out for yourself. Don't be afraid to ask questions or tell them about symptoms that crop up as you go along - and make them explain why they are doing whatever they are doing. That's what you are paying for as part of your treatment! Because I've worked with doctors (dentists) for 30+ years, they don't intimidate me. They put their pants on one leg at a time, same as you. Lol, my oncologist probably already hates to see me coming because I'm on him with all kinds of questions. RE: the icing for hands/feet - I go to Amazon for a LOT of things and found these socks there: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4WOKG. They come with ice packs that fit in little pockets on the bottom and top of the sock. I got extra ice packs for the bottom of my feet: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZVI485Y and here for the tops of the toes: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZVIG1R2. I figure the socks should work just as well for my hands/fingers, so I just got two pairs of the socks and will wear one pair on my hands. I also have read where a few ladies made their own by wearing mittens and socks and just putting frozen bags of peas on their fingers/toes/ under their feet. I have a small cooler that I'll fill with dry ice and the extra ice gel packs because you have to start 15-30 prior to the infusion, switch to new, colder packs every 15-30 minutes throughout the infusion, and then continue switching out for 30 min afterward. With the cooler and extra packs, I'll be able to keep everything as cold as possible. I know you asked astyabax66 about her hair, but I'll chime in: I cut mine short last week so I could get used to what I looked like. I got a few scarves from Amazon (where else?) at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072372Y82 and got a wig that resembles my new, short cut at a wig shop ($60). There are a bunch of shops around me, hoping there are some by you. If not, Amazon carries them! Also, you can get wigs through the American Cancer Society here: https://www.tlcdirect.org/.. My oncologist told me my hair would fall out about 2 1/2 weeks after the first chemo infusion. I figure I'll shave my head when it starts falling out, then it's scarves and wigs for the summer. :) Hang in there,djt - we'll all get through this together! Hugs to all of you, ladies!",

I start my first one (AC) tomorrow and I don't mind saying I'm getting really nervous now that it's here. I want to get started, but at the same time I want to curl up and hide, you know?. This week was rough - I had my port surgically placed on Tues afternoon (after I spent the morning in the MRI machine while they did a biopsy of a second area in the same breast where the first cancer is). I ended up with a partially collapsed lung, although I didn't realize that until today after the surgeon ordered a chest xray. I thought my backache was from the port (which, by the way, hurts like heck, just like y'all said it would! Man, seatbelts are a killer since it's in the left side of my chest). Frog on the Lilypad, thanks for the tip re: headaches and AC. I'll try to remember to ask them to slow down tomorrow. You mentioned your fingernail turning black - did you see the tips on icing your fingers/toes during infusions? I wonder if that will help? I'm glad everyone seems to be doing pretty well and that the second rounds don't seem much different from the first. I sort of thought they might compound on each other... Hugs to you all!",

My first AC was Friday and my Neulasta was yesterday so I'm not sure which is the culprit, although it's not listed as a SE of Neulasta. And it's just in my right ear. I did a search on the forums for \"tinnitus\" and see MANY posts about it. Caroboplatin CAN cause it (it's listed as a Carboplatin side effect on WebMd, which calls it a \"serious side effect\" and says you should tell your doctor asap). It doesn't seem to be a SE of the other meds (Zofran, etc). For some people, it goes away, for some it comes and goes. One person said her MO told her that there is sometimes fluid buildup in the ear that creates it. Some said acupuncture helps, some say yoga and specific poses help with it. One person said they decreased her AC because of it and one mentioned only having 2 of her 4 treatments due to it. Not sure what to do about mine - I sure don't want to cut back on treatment, especially with TNBC. To put in your diagnosis, go to your profile, then to the My Diagnosis tab. You click on Add Diagnosis to put everything in your signature. You can do the same with your treatment. Good luck tomorrow!",

I saw the oncologist today - my white blood cell count is practically non-existent and I lost 2.5 pounds since last week. We leave for our cruise tomorrow, so he's putting me on Cipro as a precaution from catching anything. And, I get to have a WBC count lab draw on Sunday before I sail. Now, I'm scared to be near anyone! The up side is that he ordered me to eat my way through the cruise so I put that lost weight back on, lol. We'll do dose #2 when I get back.

I'm convinced our other cat knows when I've had chemo (I bet he can smell it). He sticks to me like glue for the first few days, even to the point of insisting (loudly) that he must sit ON my lap, not just next to me. Our animals are such a comfort. I hope your dog gets better soon! Djt, as moth suggested, it's a good idea to run the idea of Activia and probiotics past your MO, just in case. If they are okay for you to take, I'm sure they will help. Re food/tastes, I know for my last AC, I craved barbeque flavor - I didn't want anything else. It's like being pregnant and having cravings, right? I have round #3 tomorrow and figure I'l want something like pickles and ice cream, lol. At least you are feeling better! urdrago, my kitchen table looks like an over the counter medicine cabinet, too.

He didn't want to do anything for his birthday beyond going out for dinner and a cake, but I hung up balloons and streamers regardless and they were still up when I went back the following week, so I know he enjoyed them. Fingers crossed your wife feels good and that your mom won't notice. Enjoy your mini-celebration! Grab for any spot of happiness in this whole mess. :) Djt, they gave me pills for the thrush, no lozenges. I was sorta surprised, but I'm doing the salt water rinses and Biotene, and it all seems to be helping. Thanks for the idea about pain management for the T, since I face that in about 3 weeks. Like you, I've been feeling pretty moody and grumpy, I suppose because I'm tired and sore. I'm usually pretty sunny and can't wait to get back to that side of myself. I say that you should hibernate whenever possible! I'm cleaning the house today, since I won't have the energy for the next 2 weeks, and that's making me feel like less of the slacker that I've been feeling like lately. Don't I remember reading about some of you bleeding while urinating? I sneezed and had a little leakage (sorry, TMI), then got a shock when I ran up to use the bathroom. What next? SMH",

Djt, hoping your hives go away! Benadryl, maybe? Frog, I'm sorry to hear things are tasting bitter. I've been pretty happy to get through AC with no taste change and my appetite intact. Not looking forward to that changing with T. I'm with you - this seems like a nightmare and I still can't believe I'm going through this. RE: your nails - I think I remember that you mentioned not icing your hands/feet because the MO didn't seem to support it, but I've learned that you have to be your own advocate. Ice if you want to, the rest of them be damned. This is your body - they don't get to dictate anything or shame you into doing things differently than you wish to. Bring your ice and show them it helps! <steps off soap box>. InnaB, for my AC, I take Zofran through Day 5 (counting infusion day as Day 1). We're all different, though, so you might need yours longer. For example, my Neulasta bone pain didn't hit me until Day 8 on the first round and I had quit Claritin after Day 5 based on what the \"norma;\" was supposed to be. Remember to keep a diary of this round )what you took each day, symptoms each day, etc.) It really helps guide you for the subsequent rounds. Since I did that, I remembered to take Claritin through Day 10. You think you'll remember it all, but it's too much to recall by the time you get to the next infusion.

After chemo, it looks like we might want to get boosters for Tdap, check titers for HepB, and get the flu shot this fall. Also, it mentions that people who have neutropenia should avoid those household members who have recently gotten the nasal influenza vaccine (the shot is okay). And we all should avoid infants who have gotten the rotavirus vaccine until 4-6 weeks later. Oral polio vaccines should not be given to our household members while we are on chemo. As with everything, I'm sure your MO can tell you best, though!",

Hoping she's past all the drama this time. Dee, congrats on 11/12. Also, for walking most days, despite the brutal heat and humidity we've been having this week. I do it sporadically, but I also run around like a headless chicken at work most days, so I'm counting that as exercise, lol. Re the poor lady with bone mets - that's so sad! I guess I should be grateful my bone pain passes after 24 hours or so. Duffy, good for you for your 3 mile run/walk, although I know it was so hard without Duffy! (sending hugs). I did a 3mile run/walk this past weekend. I'm hoping I can continue it while on T. My daughter and I registered for the Disney Wine and Dine half marathon on the first weekend in Nov, as a goal for me to aim for. Now, I'm wondering what I was thinking? At least I had to good sense to tell her I wasn't doing the full in January, lol. Good luck wih your edema. NoteRed, congrats on finishing the first round of chemo. I had many of the same SEs you did, but I did AC first. The worst for me on AC was constipation. I almost had an impaction twice. Do yourself a favor - start taking stool softeners and eating prunes and high fiber foods a day or two before your FEC, then continue until you know you are \"going\" regularly. Trust me, you DON't want to get backed up and the chemo plus anti-nausea meds will do it quickly. Use Miralax if you haven't gone in a day or two. Hang in there, you're almost done! mdevroy, you're so close! Good luck with your surgery decision. InnaB, my first buzz cut made me cry. Poor hubby thought he'd nicked me (he was the one buzzing my hair off). It was just because the hair loss made this nightmare all more real, you know? Frog, I tried soaking my fingers last night and it really did help - thanks for that! I also got the Opi nail strengthener and used that, plus cut my nails super short. Amazon is delivering Bag Balm tomorrow - that's supposed to help farmers and people with problem hands, so I thought I'd give it a go. Anyhow, I'm more hopeful I can deal with it now! Also, my nose runs like a faucet - luckily I wear a mask at work. Today, I was halfway through cleaning a patient's teeth and could feel my nose start dripping. Can't do anything about it at that point, but I sure was grateful she couldn't see it. I have tissues in every pocket now...hubby has taken over laundry duty and is always saying, \"someone left another tissue in their pocket. I wonder who that could be?\" lol. ",

It's so easy to go down that dark path. It seems like I do a search for something completely different, then read about someone who recurred only a few months after chemo ended.

Udrago71, that's great news that your tumor has shrunk already! I'm hoping to join you by the next go 'round. My biopsy of my second suspicious site came back as benign but abnormal cells, so onco is recommending a mastectomy instead of lumpectomy. That's fine with me! Glad you felt well enough to go to work after round 2 (and managed to kick the nausea). My first chemo round went fine today - I was worried for nothing. I iced my hands and feet during treatment (boy do they get achingly cold!). Now, my legs are tingling from the knees down and feel swollen (I'm not sure they are, though). The other thing that worries me is that I've drunk at least 2 liters of water since I was released around 1:30 p.m. (4 hours ago) and I'm barely peeing and it is NOT orange or red or whatever (it was orange when I was in the chemo treatment room, though). Am I just super-hydrated and that's why there's no color? Did anyone else NOT have color for the first couple days of A?",

I'm getting really tired of riding this train. I'm feeling good, though - no complaints except being tired and tender fingernails from day 3 to 5. And, I swear my hair is growing back. I never lost it all (I still have about 10%?) but it feels longer, softer and fuzzier when I wash. Wish I could say the eyebrows and lashes were coming back... LIFE, yay, congrats on your teeth! :) Erincoop, I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this and a newborn at the same time, especially when she had colic. It's so tough to just do one or the other. Don't beat yourself up for needing to rest - you need to recover from the chemo and should rest when your daughter sleeps. Just do the minimum that gets you through your day. B12 shots have helped me with energy - your MO should be able to give them to you. Also, if you are nauseous, Zofran helps and also is constipating so it might help both issues. Big hugs your way! By the way, I also hate my wig. I feel like it looks like I have a rug sitting on my head. I wear it for work, but wear scarves the rest of the time - much cooler and more comfortable. FDwithfurkids, hoping your scan goes well! Bobby77056, thanks for the recommendations! Bobby and InnaB, weekly Taxol is a piece of cake after going through AC (if you are doing DD, you'll have to listen to one of the other ladies). I was afraid of T due to neuropathy SE, but it has been easy. The only problems I've had by week #5 are being tired and sore finger nails from day 3-5. Please look up the tips on icing your hands and feet and taking L-Glutamine to avoid/help with neuropathy. You can decide if you want to do those things, but they have helped me a lot. My nails were VERY sore and I got \"bruises\" under them after T#1,but they improved by 85% after just one week on 30 g/day of L-glutamine. I've iced hands/feet through every T infusion and haven't had as much trouble as some of the ladies on the board. Engine, holy cow! I can't believe your poor wife is going through this! Please give her a big hug from me. So glad she's back home and doing better now. Urdrago, I'm noticing that I'm more tired, too. Dry mouth started with this infusion, ugh. Everything I own is either hairless or dried out, lol. Frog and Urdrago, since we're all TNBC, I'm interested in hearing what your BS have to say - treatment options, reconstruction, etc. Please let me know either here or PM me! I'm doing UMX, at this point, but they won't even schedule me for a consult until mid-Aug because I won't finish chemo until early Sept and they want at least 4 weeks post-chemo before surgery. Somehow, the idea of surgery is scarier than chemo has been for me. Like Erincoop mentioned, I'm afraid I'll feel like less of a woman once I lose a body part. Sorry if I've missed anyone. Have a relaxing, SE-free weekend everyone. Hugs!",

You're going through this right along with Janice - maybe not physically, but sometimes emotionally is just as much of a struggle. I can not believe her incision is draining again! Do you suppose there is some necrotic tissue hiding out that needs to be removed? I see it happen in dentistry sometimes - the outer tissue looks all right, but underneath, there is a small area that just won't heal and needs to be removed. So glad your son will be here today, and hoping Janice stays out of the hospital (and am glad the dog is feeling better. :) ) LIFE, hoping your neuropathy is temporary. The numb face thing feels strange, I'm sure. Congrats on getting your radiation scheduled! InnaB, thinking of you and sending good vibes for today's infusion! Deborah - so excited for you! I KNOW you enjoyed your bike ride. Nothing like doing something you love to lift your spirits. FDwithfurkids, how did you scan results go? And your vacation? Hoping no more irrigation repairs while you visited your mom. Frog, glad they'll reduce your dosage for the last couple of infusions. 2 more to go! It's good to hear that 99% of the benefit is in the first weeks. My MO has mentioned stopping my T after 8 if I continue to have RBC problems, but that worries me even though he has said the last 4 are simply insurance. Hoping your poor fingers feel better in a day or so! I went crazy this weekend, reading up on how to raise my RBCs. I am determined not to have them hold my chemo for any reason (and to get all 12). I started on iron supplements on Thursday (MO ok'd, just said they wouldn't help due to bone marrow suppression). I got my multi-vitamins back out of the cabinet and started on them. Got a high protein powder to mix into a drink, got powdered greens to mix into water. Bought fresh fruits and spinach and had tuna for lunch yesterday. Got protein bars to snack on at work. They gave me chemo last Wed when my RBCs were 7.8 - at this point, my levels don't have to come up because I know they'll give it to me this Wed if they just don't go down. That's what I'm hoping for and then a nice, steady increase over the next few weeks. Happy Monday y'all - have a great week!  ",

I can totally see the temptation to get it over with, but I'm afraid of the neuropathy most of all. I iced my hands and feet for AC round #1, but they told me AC doesn't cause neuropathy problems so I didn't do it for #2. I've noticed some tingling at the tips of my middle fingers on both hands, though, and read somewhere that A or C (or maybe both) is very hard on the capillaries.

I can't imagine doing chemo by vein. Seriously, they won't do a PICC line for your last two? I'd be hopping up and down on someone's desk until they consented! No itching for me, but they give me IV steroids and Benadryl before they do the T. Hoping you are being given that as well. As for protein, I got a whey protein powder (60g protein/scoop), so I'm not sure you need to eat meat if you don't want to. I am also eating Greek yogurt and have added iron supplements and high-iron foods like spinach and kale to my diet. I meditate, so I'm also doing positive imaging and picturing the bone marrow cranking out RBCs. Duffy, congrats on being done ! It's great that you're moving on with treatment.

Urdrago, I have just been walking 3 to 4 days a week this week, because I think the impact of running may be partly why my feet were sore last week. The fingers that are my worst are the ones I put pressure on at work, so it makes sense that running might have aggravated the bottoms of my feet. I can't find anything online about whether it's fine to stop chemo early (just people saying they did it, but how do you know if they had a recurrence?).

No, my sores don't heal - I still have my scab from the Neulasta from round #2 and I'm facing round 4 next Tuesday. Hubby pointed out that our rbc and wbc are way low (at least mine are (lower than when I went on the cruise), plus I'm slightly anemic now), so that makes total sense to me. Also, I still have a two week old bruise from the blood draw prior to this one (not a fan of this phlebotomist). Anyhow, yay for no Carboplatin for either of us (although the voices in my head keep asking if I should insist on it anyhow, just to know I did all I could?). I now think I have thrush and I have a huge sore on my tongue and in my cheek. I forgot to suck on ice during AC round 3, plus I've slacked off on the Activia yogurt, despite telling DJT to eat it. Sigh. I wonder how long my mouth will take to heal, especially since round #4 is in less than a week. I'm with Frog - I hate this stupid disease. Frog, glad the T doesn't seem too bad. Hoping that you still feel that way now that you're a few days farther along from the infusion. Duffy, I hope your baby run was good. I'm doing baby walks right now, lol. So sorry your Duffy isn't so perky, but I'm glad he's stable for now. LIFE, the internet is NOT your friend, lol! That being said, I'm on it far too much, too...:). Good luck tomorrow! I can't remember now - did someone mention taking Claritin for the bone pain if they give you Neulasta? If not, try it - it has helped many of us. I stopped mine too soon (day 5 after my first Neulasta) and the pain was like giving birth when it kicked in on day 8. Good luck tomorrow, InnaB! Oh - despite losing most of the hair on my head, I haven't lost it all (nor any of my body hair - I still have to shave my legs, dang it). I SWEAR the hair on my head is growing. I'd buzzed it really short a few weeks ago because it felt like needles pricking my scalp. It was fine after that, but it hurts again and feels longer when I run my hand over it. Anyone else growing hair? Of course, my mind jumps to \"the chemo quit working\"... Big hugs to you all!",

The MO called in a Dyflucan RX for me yesterday. Both my dentist bosses were on the fence about whether it really is thrush, but I can already see a difference in the white coating on my tongue after one pill, so fingers crossed the RX helps. Wondering what fresh hell will Round #4 bring on Tuesday? arynb, welcome, but sorry you're here. My port was placed in mid-April and was sore for a few weeks, but I can actually (almost) tolerate the seat belt in the car now, which runs right over it. I bet your bras/bathing suit straps will be fine in a couple of weeks. Do a search for padded seat belt covers, etc, that you can make. I'm sure you can buy them if needed, too. RE: the ice for hands/feet...you wear them from about 15-20 minutes before they begin the infusion, all the way through it, and for another 15-20 min after. I bought socks that came with the ice packs on Amazon (and a second pair to use as gloves), then some other ice packs to supplement since they won't stay cold that whole infusion time and you have to switch them out. There are other notes on here (I think under the Pinned Posts?) about people who made their own with frozen bags of veggies and velcro, or soaked hands/feet in tubs of ice water during infusions. Anyhow, I bring a small ice chest on wheels to my infusions and keep the ice in there. Just be sure to suck on the ice during the infusion, too!! I had no problem with mouth sores for AC #1 or #2, but got to chatting with the oncology nurse during AC #3 and forgot to do it. Now, I'm paying the price with a very sore mouth and ulcers on my tongue and cheeks. RE: a dental visit - I work for dentists and we have cancellations all the time. You might call yours on Monday morning and tell them to put you in if someone cancels that day. We often can slide someone in to cover a day-of cancellation and we are fully booked until Jan. 2019! If you get neulasta, take your Claritin (NOT Claritin D) at least through day 5. My bone pain doesn't hit until day 8, so I take it through day 10, but YMMV. NO ONE told me to watch out for constipation, which both AC and the anti-nausea med, Zofran, can give you. If you do anything - do yourself a favor and take a stool softener and eat high fiber foods, like dried prunes. That was a pretty miserable SE of AC #1,2 until I figured out what to do about it! FWIW, I've had absolutely NO issues with taste or food, so you may not have it either. Everyone else's SE may not be your SEs! Also, I was super-tired and flu-like from the late afternoon of Day 4 (counting infusion day as Day 1) for about 24-30 hours, then it went away. I say that so you'll know that it isn't forever. KEEP a diary of your symptoms and what you took (Claritin, Pepcid, etc) each day for the first round, that will help with the other rounds as SEs don't vary too much (for the most part). Also, though we may be getting a lot of the same meds, a lot of us are on different regimens. Example: I'll be getting 12 weekly rounds of T and was terrified of the SEs until I realized that I'll be getting it weekly and some ladies on here are getting it DD which gives them stronger SEs and makes it tougher to deal with. Not saying 12 weeks will be a walk in the park, but I think (hope... PRAY) the weekly dose will be a little easier! Oh - they give a steroid infusion just before starting the A infusion, then you'll get the C infusion after the A is done. The first infusion was about 5 hours, total, for me, the next 2 were about 3.5 hours each. Bring snacks, try to drink at least 2 liters of water daily, starting the day before. You'll pee orange a few times after the A (I do for about 24 hours). If you ice (they say it's not necessary to ice for AC, but I have iced during the A), be aware that your hands/feet may throb and feel like needles for awhile after. I didn't know this and called the MO, who worried I had a blood clot and sent me to the ER.*Don't be shy about telling your MO about ANY SE so they can hop on them quickly - my MO says \"people don't want to bother us, but how can we help them if we don't know?\". RE wigs, I wear one to work and hate it. I live in scarves the rest of the time. I'm in GA, so I can only imagine how awful it will be to wear that flipping wig in mid-July, gahhhhhh. :( Engine, happy birthday to your mom!! That's awesome and it's also great that your wife is doing better (love her positive attitude). I sure hope her next round goes better. Good luck to your uncle! Frog, I'm glad you're doing well. I'm not looking forward to bone pain though.. At least you're walking! I'm thrilled to walk 2 miles at this point. Hang in there, Linda2119. I understand how you feel - this AC round 3 kicked me good, We can do it - just think, you're 1/3 of the way through this! Good luck with #4 today! Weeedie, so glad you're doing better! I'd love to run away with you...some days I just can't imagine how I ended up here, going through this crap. Astaynax - congrats on your son's graduation! Celebrate with some french fries, lol. Glad you're surviving ATL's traffic. :) Hugs to all of you!",

Maybe a \"ritual sacrifice\" would work, like giving up something you love for a period of time (ie: giving up chocolate for a week)? Sort of the way Catholics give up something for Lent... In any case, I'm glad you are less foggy. Are you eating enough protein? Maybe that is part of your fainting spells if your blood counts are low? Take care of yourself!",

Sorry about the lemon in the water...you can still do that, just don't drag out drinking the drink...finish it within 15 minutes or so or have it with a meal. If you can rinse with baking soda after, that helps to neutralize the acids in your mouth, too. (I'm sure your sensitive taste buds will take particular delight in baking soda, lol.) I'm glad to hear that you're working - I've been wondering if I'll be forced to take off the last few weeks of T due to exhaustion/pain/neuropathy. Work from home is not an option in my job! Ingerp, I have IBS, too, so I've been dreading the Big D when I start T (although the Big C I've been having with AC was no picnic like you'd think, let me tell you). So glad you've had no nausea - I'll do the 2 day Zofran plan, too, then, thanks. Positive, I can see how you'd swing back and forth (D or C). They told me Zofran is constipating, so maybe if you take it the first couple of days, that's what brings on C on day 3? Anyhow, it's good to know your experience and also that your pain seems manageable (yours, too, Dee). Let me tell you, Neulasta pain is a b^tch. I wasn't looking forward to that every week.

My poor fingers have been so sore despite the icing - very tough when you work with your fingers all day long. I didn't use the gel pads on my hand this time - I brought a plastic container and filled it with ice, then plunged my fingers right into the ice. Sure hoping that helps more. I also started 30g of L-glutamine daily this past weekend (I had only been taking 2grams before, not realizing the calculation difference between mg and g. Can you tell that math is not my strong suit?)...My nails look almost white underneath the nail, with red spots on the more painful nails (despite using OPI nail envy, soaking them in vinegar/water or epsom salts/water). The nice thing is that this was Week #10 or 20, so I am officially beginning the countdown to the finish line now! Also, they gave me another B12 shot. The PA couldn't believe that my red blood cells are down to within 0.10 of needing a blood transfusion, yet I ran/walked 3 miles twice in the last few days. She thinks I should be flat on my back from fatigue. Apparently the B12 helped! Engine - the PA recommended Smooth Move tea for constipation. It has sennosides in it (like what Sennakot has). You drink a cup at bedtime, then can \"go\" the next morning. I have seen others on this board who use it and like it. You can get it at Kroger, Walmart, Amazon, etc. She gave my a couple of tea bags to try, so I'll let you know \"how it goes\" (see what I did there? :) ). Dee, yay - congrats on finishing chemo! I feel like a loser since I still have 10 freakin' more infusions to go... Duffy, thanks for the list to combat SEs. Re your acid reflux, mine was so bad my MO prescribed an acid blocker for me. OTC Pepcid, etc, just wasn't cutting it. He advised me to take it every day until after treatment ends in 10 weeks because it takes a few days to kick in if I stop taking it between infusions. DebAL, glad the dentist appointment went well! I AM proud of you! I laughed at your comment about having your dad's hair because I still have hair and it looks like male pattern baldness (I've got it on the sides, but not much on top, lol) so I can totally see your point. I'm quite sure I've missed people in this post. I (always) scroll back through a few of the previous pages to refresh my memory because I can't keep it all straight. I did that this evening and am too groggy to recall what people said after a few entries, so I gave up. If I missed you, know that I'm sending good thoughts to everyone even if I didn't mention you!

It only dropped 0.10 this time (last week it dropped 0.30), so maybe I just needed to get used to the T. Today, I feel great, thanks to the steroids. I also have no fever and no cough (again, thanks to the steroids?). The PA thought neither was T related, that I was fighting something off. All I know is, I got T #3 - whew. 9 to go... Thanks for that crazy lady story, Life - I'm still chuckling! Dee, I've read more than once that people say the exhaustion and some SEs are almost worse the first couple weeks off chemo, sorry to say. I guess that makes sense if this is all cumulative. Sorry the herceptin has you feeling flu-like. So glad you got home before it hit, though. Keep drinking and flush all that out of you! Frog, I'm so sorry. This too, shall pass, but it's hard to be optimistic when you feel like crap. Just think, in just a few days, you'll only have 5 more to go! You'll get there - we'll drag you through it if we have to! This sounds silly, but when I hit that low point, I try to think of things I'm grateful for (which can be tough when you doubt there is anything). I'm grateful for so much, though - we found the cancer when it was small, I'm being treated (some women can't afford it or don't have access to chemo), my family and friends have rallied around me, I have great support from this board, I'm able to work, I have the chance to beat this, I'm still alive and kicking (unlike my patient who I just found out dropped dead of a heart attack 2 days before his 60th birthday - shocked the heck out of me!), etc. Finding those good things helps me feel a little better. YOU CAN DO THIS! I hope you're feeling better today! InnaB, so sorry you are feeling yucky after AC#3. Hang in there! I felt awful after that one - so much that I really dreaded AC 4, which turned out to be a piece of cake. I had no SEs with #4, except being tired - no \"flu\", no nausea, nothing. I'm wishing you the same for your #4!! Djt, ugh about the nosebleeds, etc. Haven't had those yet. You're right - our poor bodies have been through the ringer, with more to come. I still have surgery to look forward to. Not sure about radiation, due to my triple negative status, but my MO originally said I wouldn't need it if I had a mastectomy, which is what I will be having. IngerP, good luck with your infusion today! And I hope you are feeling better. Urdrago, how are you doing after T #5 yesterday?  Re surgery and reconstruction - I'll be having a unilateral mastectomy. Do any of you know if the implant you get with tissue expanders is permanent? Have you had expanders placed after your surgery? I'm asking because I've read that regular breast augmentation-type implants often need to be replaced every 10-15 years. But, I have friends who have had theirs for 20 years. I don't want to even think about having surgery again in 10-20 years! Yet, I also don't want the exchange surgery I'd have to have with tissue expanders/implant. The way I feel right now, I just want to be done, so an immediate implant would be nice, but I'd go with expanders/future implant if it meant never having to replace that type of implant. Clearly, I haven't had a surgical consult yet, but it's coming up. TIA for any thoughts... Wishing you all a good, SE-free weekend - hugs!",

Good luck with your decision on the Keytruda trial - research will help. Maybe talking with your family or a close friend, too? Sometimes other people who aren't caught up in the emotion and fear of a diagnosis the way we are, can point of something we might not see or might overlook. It's a tough decision, for sure.

These go away between 20-60 days after finishing rads. Zinc supplements are supposed to help. You also need to be aware that rads can cause more cavities because of how it changes the saliva, so use prescription fluoride if you have it/can get it. Also, be wary of sweets, just like you were during chemo. Don't suck on candies or chew gum if your mouth is dry, unless they are sugar-free. Mouthwashes with chlorhexidine in them are helpful (probably have to get these from your dentist), as are candy or gum products containing xylitol (example: Trident gum). Last, all of us should see our dentists now for a checkup, especially if we haven't seen them since we started treatment in the spring. That way you can catch any cavities/problems while they are small! :)",

You all have become friends so it's great to be able to actually sit down and chat in person. As she said, she'll be in town for a wedding that is about 20 miles from my house so I'm going to pop over and have coffee. We'll definitely post a picture! Anyone else passing through Atlanta, let me know so we can meet, too! Piksie, I had 12 weekly doses of Taxol. I iced through them all and also through 3 of 4 ACs. I think it helped, despite some problems I had. I got some neuropathy that started about week 4-5 (?) - VERY sore fingertips and sore nails after each infusion. That settled down about 2 days before the next T (they were still sore, but not as much). My feet did well until week 8, when it started feeling like I had socks bunched up under them. 5 nails turned green (!), but I didn't lose any. Both big toenails turned black, but I didn't lose them. I'm a dental hygienist, so I need to have finger dexterity and I worked through all 12 Ts without losing it (can still button tiny buttons and pick up small items). I'm now 8.5 weeks PFC (gosh, that happened fast!) and everything is probably 85-90% better. The green nails are about 2/3 grown out, fingers are slightly tender at the very tips, nails are not sore at all. I expect to be 100% by year end. We are all different at how we experience chemo, plus I did 12 doses vs your 4DD, so if you ice, YMMV. For me, I would definitely ice if I had to do this again, God forbid. I think I would have been so much worse without icing. I figured it couldn't hurt and might help, so why not do it? FYI, here's a thread on how to improvise icing, if you decide to do it: community.breastcancer.org/for... ... Good luck!",

I read the thread about what you wish you'd known before your mastectomy and it scared the heck out of me. I had to stop reading and go back another day. So sorry you haven't been feeling well this round of T, hoping for NO SEs for you this time. At least you know you're winding down to the end of chemo. Good luck with your infusion today! :) Urdrago, I'd also appreciate seeing your questions, especially as they relate to TNBC. I don't know abything about TNBC missing a gene, but I'm doing a search for it now. I have a patient who is a 6 year tnbc survivor - she convinced her dr (MO? PCM?) to put her on Metformin for a year following her surgery/chemo, due to studies. My MO seems willing to do that for me. If yours won't and you're interested in trying it, there is a supplement called berberine that is supposed to mimic the effects of Metformin and some ladies are taking that. I also saw studies about taking low dose aspirin to help ward off recurrence. RE: hair - mine isn't necessarily coming back, but the 7ish % I have left on my head seems to be growing longer. I haven't lost any more of what I have (I still have hair on my arms and some on my head), except for eyebrows. I have a few straggler eyelashes left, too. Engine, sorry to hear about Janice's diarrhea. I haven't had to take immodium for chemo, but have taken it in the past for IBS. What is she concerned about? Impaction, maybe, since she had it that time at the beginning? She can cut the immodium in half and take half of one - maybe that would help, but not plug her up too much?",

I would want to hear the perio measurement numbers around the areas that he's talking about doing surgery on before I can give you concrete advice, but using a laser is a good option as a stopgap. It has a good record of halting disease progress and can sometimes stimulate reattachment of the gum a couple of millimeters higher on the tooth, which is what you want. A bone graft isn't usually done unless you've lost quite a bit of bone around the tooth/teeth. Also, a cleaning every 3 months is standard for the first year. You'll have them done at the perio office for that year, then will alternate with the periodontist and your regular office after that. It sounds like your hygienist is on top of things. If you do the laser treatment and use the water pick faithfully (I'm a big fan of it, too!), you may never need surgery. If you can give me the measurements (call the perio office and ask for them), I can help you more.",

They just don't stop and think how they would feel if they were in our position. You've got this - don't worry! I'm betting that all is fine with your liver and it's just the pain meds kicking up the levels. Like you, I'm feeling lazy. It's hard to find the will to get up and hit the treadmill when it's dark so early. Yesterday I came home from work and relaxed for a bit, then told DH I was putting on my comfy pj's. He gave me a funny look. I went upstairs to change, glanced at the clock and saw it was only 6:30! No wonder he squinted at me, lol. I seriously thought it was closer to 8:30. I'm going to start stretching and yoga as soon as the PS lets me. My back is already hurting at work after just 2.5 days of being back and I'm sure it's from muscle weakness (I had a problem with that during the last part of chemo, too). My TEs won't let me do much right now. Happy Thanksgiving to all you wonderful ladies and Engine! You all rank right up at the top of the list of things I have to be thankful for this year - I'm not sure how I would have made it through all of this without your kind words and support. I'm so grateful. Safe journeys to those traveling and big hugs to you all!",

She's flying home now so here I am. I was surprised at how well I did while she was here. When we planned this, I was afraid I'd be on the couch the whole time, but we got in some hiking yesterday and also did a craft project at one of those sip and paint shops. I'm tired but okay. Hoping that means my RBCs are up again. My fingers are tender but basically okay. I'm ready for T #8 on Wed. Still have the occasional cough from the T and a stuffed/dried out/bloody nose. Plus, my mouth is so dry and I can't seem to change that no matter how much I drink. *Watch out for your teeth if your mouth is dry = remember, no sucking on sugared candy or drinking lemon water, etc. Fdwithfurkids, great news about your tumor shrinking! LIFE (Julia) and everyone, I plan to continue checking in on this board and posting updates for a long time to come. I feel like we've all braved this together and it's bonded us. I'm not ready to let that go yet. Plus, I want to know how everyone is doing in the future. Please keep posting, y'all - I'll keep answering! Hiking lady, thanks for the info on supplements and protein, much appreciated. DebAL and Maggie, good luck with your surgeries this week. DebAL thanks for the supplement info, too. Yay for Janice and you, Engine! So hoping she has no SEs from this one. InnaB, I've been taking 30g l-glutamine daily for neuropathy and also the Claritin D daily and have had no pain whatsoever on T (of course, you're DD, so that may be different, but the onco nurse mentioned that people who take l-gluatmine for neuropathy seem to have less/no pain). Also, I just put a light sock on my hands and put them into ice in a bin that I hold on my lap because the gel packs don't stay cold enough (they do on my feet but not my hands). Ingerp, congrats on finishing on Friday! Urdrago, are they giving you the T too fast and that's why you have headaches? Or maybe it's super-dry sinuses? Sorry either way! Frog, hoping this lowered dose of T #11 will be easier on you. Almost done!! Hugs to everyone. If I missed you in a comment, my apologies - soooo many posts to remember... Wishing for no SEs for those of you still on chemo and an easy recovery for DebAL and Maggie. <3",

Got a call at 3:00am the morning before (Thurs) saying my 35 year old son was being airlifted for emergency open heart surgery. He's in Colorado, I'm in Atlanta but I actually managed to get to the hospital in Colorado by 10 am. He had an aortic aneurysm, with an aortic dissection (tear). He was extremely lucky that the tear was confined to inside the aneurysm and the aorta hadn't completely ruptured. (An aortic dissection is what killed John Ritter and, more recently, Alan Thicke.) He'd initially been taken to the ER by his boss because he wasn't making sense and had a headache. They did a CT scan, which found something in his brain, but the dissection took precedence. He was in ICU until late yesterday, now is in the cardiac unit. Today they did an MRI to check his brain... Turns out he has also had a stroke (that was the reason he wasn't making sense at work). We'll find out more from the neurologist tomorrow. The good news is that he doesn't have any residual effects from the stroke. More good news is that I am healthy enough to stay here to care for him for the first weeks after he gets discharged. What if this was during chemo or just after (or right before) my surgery? Anyhow, thanks for letting me vent. I thought I'd been through a lot, but this kid has so much more on his plate. It just reinforces that we need to live each day to the fullest, tell people you care about them, hug your spouse/SO/kids and don't put off doing the things you want to do. Tomorrow is never guaranteed. ",

Plus, there's the dense tissue thing in my case, too, Plus not wanting to have mammograms forever (especially since my lump wasn't even seen on the mammo). He will do skin sparing and nipple sparing, I asked for them and he was on board. I'll do TEs first, then implants. I couldn't stomach the idea of flaps and healing 4 places at once (2 mastectomies and 2 donor sites). He also said not to expect nipple sensation, that it would be gravy if I had any afterward. That part makes me really sad. Any good news on that front, ladies? InnaB, so sorry your friends had problems with their flap surgeries. Just another reason I didn't want to mess with them. DebAL, sounds like things are healing well despite being bruised/swollen. The surgeon said I'd probably do the exchange surgery 2-3 months after the mastectomies. Ugh.

Yes, the weird thing about the Taxol weekly vs DD chemo is that DD is 4 doses every other week = 8 doses. But weekly is 12 doses. MO says he has never understood why they came up with 12 instead of only 8 when they decided a weekly protocol was as beneficial as the DD. So his magic number is 8 and the other 4 he'd like to give to meet protocol, but he feels like they are more \"optional\" in a way. I actually get more chemo by doing the 12 than if I did the DD, too, so I can see his point that 10 might be plenty. Except, I'm triple negative, so the MO and I both would like to see me get all 12. Playing it by ear as to how symptoms are this week.. Urdrago, sending light and good vibes that your lymph nodes are fine and just swollen because they are fighting off the chemo or something else. I know what you mean about being both happy and sad to ring the bell. Part of me worries that the second I ring the bell, the tumor will hear it and start growing again or pop up somewhere else. Plus I'll miss my chemo nurse who makes it fun, if you can say that about getting chemo, lol. Re the eczema bumps, none here - just crusty red patches on my face that get very dry and peel off. My eyes are constantly \"sticky\", sometimes my eyelids stick together when I blink. Re my fingers, etc - I haven't tried Biofreeze but I do have samples from the chiropractor and running packs that you get when you do a race. I might try them. It's not super painful, but we don't want to have it get worse. Yes, they would move up my surgery if I ended chemo early. Hoping your work environment gets better fast! Please let us know how things go today! Frog, thanks for the food info. I picked up turmeric when this started, but was asked to hold it off until after chemo, so now I'll hold until after surgery based on the blood thinning info. The food tips make sense. I want to change our diet when I'm done with this, although I've already switched to organic as much as possible. Re a reduced chemo dose (which I am positive he said prior we could do if needed), the MO now says he won't consider in my case. I asked why it was okay to drop two treatments, but not to give those 2 at a reduced dose, but he said \"it doesn't work that way\" (his favorite line). I know others on this site have gotten reduced doses (like you). Who knows? We are subject to the whims of the MO. Life, yay for you - enjoy your camping vacation! Thanks for the neuropathy info. I do notice that I'm much better by the day before and day of treatment, so here's hoping... I feel bad about complaining when others on here have had it much worse. If my fingers weren't my career, I wouldn't worry so much, lol. InnaB, I was thinking about how you suffer with chemo. I'm sure they did that KI67 on you to predict its aggressiveness. In view of the new TailorRx report that says some women don't need chemo, maybe you don't need those last two doses? I would think they would have checked that, but it doesn't hurt to ask. Here's the report link: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa180471... (\"Adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with hormone-receptor\u2013positive, HER2-negative, axillary node\u2013negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score, although some benefit of chemotherapy was found in some women 50 years of age or younger.\") Onward to the weekend...!

I can understand your frustrations with the curls, though, because mine is \"just\" beginning to curl (poodle like) when it's freshly washed. I can't do a thing to get it to lay down. 6 months ago, who'd have thought we'd ever be griping about our hair, lol? InnaB, it's nice to have your daughter nearby. They never visit often enough, do they? :) Urdrago, I hope the Benadryl is working and you are sleeping more. Duffy I used Clairol Natural Instincts. Do a strand test first if you decide to color it. Some people's hair seems to repel the color and some takes it up too much (like Urdrago said it pulled a lot of red in her hair). I got a darker color and dyed it again today... Much better (see below). No, my daughter isn't running the Disney race this year (she couldn't last year either because she had a pelvic stress fracture. Just my SIL and I ran it). She was training for it, but ran a half marathon in Nov and now her hip is bothering her so she decided not to push it. Yep, I have a bunch of FB posts coming up from last year, too. Good thing we didn't know then what was coming up in the next couple of months afterwards. Linda, your hair is nice and thick! Hoping the color changes for you as it comes in more. I'm glad the trial drug is going well. I'm sorry you're struggling emotionally, though. It hits at weird times, doesn't it? Lately, I've been able to keep my fears in check, but this weekend was a struggle for me, too. Maybe because we're hitting right around the anniversary of (impending) diagnosis? I think the holidays had something to do with it, too. They certainly weren't as \"carefree\" as in all the years before. The spector of this kept hovering over my head, especially with my son's health concerns. DebAL, your hair is gorgeous! I love the color. Hoping mine will look as nice in 3 mo!  ",

I can't imagine still having something in front of you.., Urdrago. I'm sure you're exhausted and Linda, you, too. It just seems to go on and on, doesn't it? But, Urdrago, Frog has said that Xeloda is very easy - hoping she'll hop on here soon and reassure you. Linda, I can't imagine having to go back and be hooked up to an IV for the trial, but you can do this and you'll get a great benefit from it! As for recurrence thoughts, yep, they are super tough to deal with. I am usually a very positive person, but it does get in my head sometimes. I try to tell myself to just enjoy today because none of us knows what tomorrow will bring. I don't want to fall into that hole of worrying and waste time and happiness by being dragged down with \"what-ifs\" that may never happen. I've had many patients tell me their stories after my diagnosis and so often they are several years out from treatment and are just fine. Some tell me of in-laws who were diagnosed 40 years ago when women didn't have the treatment's we do today and they never recurred. A close friend of mine was diagnosed 25 years ago - had an MX and that's it... No chemo, no rads, and she's perfectly fine today. Maybe this will help - someone in another group I'm in said her MO told her that, of 100 women who are diagnosed, 70 will never have recurrence - with or without chemo, But they don't know which 70, so they give chemo to all 100. Of the remaining 30, 15 will never recur after having chemo. That gave me some perspective. Why shouldn't I be one of the 85 (like my friend) instead of one of the 15? Big cyber hugs to you all!",

The MO said it lessens at 1 month, then again around 3 mo, then again at 6 and a year. Hopefully, faster than that for all of us. Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The curcumin in it is supposed to be a big cancer fighter. I have some ready to take when the MO clears me. Duffy, good luck with the swelling now that your port is gone. Congrats on getting it out! Sorry you have to be living in MI away from your family during rads. I hope it is only the 3-4 weeks they've been planning on. DebAL, I'm sure this hits us all hard at some point. I can see where you have lots of time to think (and worry) once treatment is done. Hoping you feel more ready to take on your job in a few days. It's rough to have to go back to a face-paced environment and the stress. Maybe there will be a position in the future that would let you dial it back a little. Keep hitting the trails and working out that stress! InnaB, so very excited and happy for you that your infusion went well today! Hoping the SEs from the Abraxane will be mild-to-none. Only 1 more to go! Bobby77056, I have fuzzies on the top of my head, but nothing on the sides. I just got T #11 today. I check my hair daily (I try not to, but I miss my hair!) and apply castor oil, but not much yet. Good for you for growing your hair back so fast! For me, Taxol has been easy except for being tired and my fingers (a \"raw\" feeling at the fingertips and my nails look like a combo of infection and bruising). I ice during every infusion - you might look at the threads on that. I have some problems even with doing the icing, I can't imagine what I would have if I hadn't done it. I haven't missed any work with either AC or Taxol, but I think (hope!) you'll find T to be much easier than AC. Watch your protein - my RBCs kept dropping every week, then someone here mentioned that I might need more protein. Turns out you need 80-100 gm more of protein daily while on chemo. Never heard that from my MO (who was also surprised to hear it, but couldn't argue when I started drinking protein drinks and raised my RBCs by almost 1 point in one week). Good luck! Egine, hoping Janice is still doing well and gaining more stamina daily. Hoping you can relax this weekend. I got T #11 today. My RBCs held steady, my fingers felt pretty decent before the infusion (no foot problems this week), so I'm confident the finger tip issues will go away once I'm done next week. Next week. Next week. I can barely stand the wait. It's a good thing we'll be with my family and some friends this holiday weekend, it will help pass the time. I'm bummed that I'll still have to go to the MO the week after I'm done (blood counts will be run) and 3 weeks PFC (covering all bases before surgery), but at least they should be quick visits. Urdrago, hoping you're feeling better this first week past chemo.Hope your weekend is relaxing. Weren't you going to a beautiful beach after chemo? I swear I remember a post a looonnnngggg time ago about a place you were going after chemo... Frog, hoping you're enjoying your getaway and that the weather is cooperating and spring-like. Have a nice long weekend for those who get Labor Day off this Monday. Hugs to everyone!",

I think it's normal to worry, plus you're recovering from yet another surgery, which is tough, Your poor body has been through a lot - hang in there (((hugs))). Urdrago, I sure hope you feel better soon! I'm not saying your vomiting on Thursday wasn't from the Xeloda, but I know we've seen a LOT of stomach bugs in our city in the past few weeks. I had a teacher tell me last week that 20% of his class was out sick. Hoping it was \"just\" that. There's also a cold going around that is just in the chest - no fever, sneezing, etc - you just sound hoarse and feel yucky. Hoping that none of it was Xeloda-related and was just coincidental timing. Big hugs to you! Linda, how was your Phoenix trip? Are you still doing well on the trial meds?",

I had a lady come up to me while I was having breakfast in a nearby diner this past Saturday (because I was wearing a tight cap and clearly had no hair). She asked if I was going through cancer treatment, then told me she was triple positive (which is as bad as my triple negative). She's 5 years out from treatment and doing well. And wished me well. That was very nice and I was in a space where it was great to have her give me a boost and show me that not everyone recurs. I keep feeling like the cancer is coming back while I wait for surgery, even though the MRI shows that it isn't.. Yep, swollen feet here.

Just an FYI, dig out your Zofran if you have any left form chemo. Holy moly, I was SUPER nauseous for the first 24 hours. I think they did a patch thing for the BMX, but gave me nothing this time around so I was grateful I had some left over. Also, I figured you were wanting to see the MO at 6 mo, but I really did wonder if you hoped for 3 months since you had the scare with the implant and everyone was worried about recurrence. Re the allergies (like how you were allergic to Macrobid...did the allergies resolve over time or do you still have them today?

I had AC every other week x 4, followed by 12 weekly Taxols. The Taxols were a breeze, but dose dense people would tell you differently. For me, AC felt like I was coming down with the flu, but not like I had it, if that makes sense. I felt worn out and tired, not much energy, and I had the nausea. It really helped me to take the nausea meds on time. If I waited until I felt sick to take the meds, then they took awhile to catch up. I took nausea meds every 8 hours and would feel queasy at about six hours, so I kept food in my stomach around the 6 hour mark (ginger cookies, dry cereal like mini-wheats, crackers, etc). I never actually got sick and threw up. Also, you need to know that the flu-like feeling and nausea only lasted for about 24 hours. I could feel it kicking in around 3:00 pm on Thursday (after my infusion on Tues) and could feel it leaving around 3:00 pm on Friday. I also worked all through chemo and only missed time when I had my infusions. My oncologist and I worked out my infusion schedule so I had the worst symptoms over the weekend. Keep a chemo diary when you start - note your symptoms and when they came on and what helped them. Each infusion afterward will be nearly identical, so the diary helps you know what to expect. Good luck! Robin",

All of a sudden no one seems to \"care\" anymore when you're not in active treatment. No scans, no bloodwork after the first normal results, they just ask how you are feeling at the 3 mo check ups... I sort of felt like I was kicked to the curb (that isn't true, but you can't help how you feel). I was relieved to be done, then disappointed to be done. It's all so very weird, but you'll see what I mean. Anyhow, I hope your hair IS returning to normal! I get it about the curls - I am naturally curly but, girl, I am POODLE curly right now. Not a fan. I am really thinking of cutting it super-pixie short again. I liked it better at the 4 month PFC mark than I do now. But when I stopped wearing my wig, my patients all kept saying, \"OMG, your hair is so cute, but you really cut it short! Why did you do it?\" until I wanted to scream. (Actually, I did lose it with a couple of them because they wouldn't let it go after I thanked them and shut up. It was mean of me, but I figured if they asked about 5 times what made me cut it sooooo short (like several people did), they deserved to hear just exactly WHY it was short! Anyhow, not sure I can emotionally go through that again!). Sorry for the rant :) Duffy, how are you feeling? I hope the weather has cooperated and you have been able to get outside. I know what you mean about seeing - in writing - the cancer running through your family. I am also BRCA negative, but my Dad's mom passed of colon cancer, Dad's brother (still alive at 87) had testicular cancer, my mom died of brain cancer (and she also had a blood cancer), my aunt died of a blood cancer (and her daughter passed of a childhood cancer at 22), my uncle and grandmother died of colon cancer (all on Mom's side). I feel like I was sort of doomed to get this. My sister, however, has decided that she is not going to get cancer in any form and has refused to EVER get a mammogram (never has, never will). Argh. I wish it was that simple (just refuse and all is good)! Urdrago, what's happening with the Xeloda? Are you tolerating the shorter doses? Hoping you all have a great week!",

Good luck with the shoveling, I shouldn't tell you that it was 82 and sunny today while you were freezing, should I? IngerP, I truly hope this is your very last last next month! Your weekend with the cancer survivors sounded great - only people who have been there truly get it. And, if you or Duffy find that cancer-refusing paperwork my sister seems to think exists, let me know. I sure wish she had forwarded it to me last year..<SMH> Oh - re chemo brain - I have it in spades (can't find the words on the tip of my tongue) but I can't blame it on AI, just on chemo. I'm milking that for as long as I can, too. :) Urdrago I am glad to hear you have finally found the right Xeloda dose! Duffy, great race suggestions, thanks! Okay, I'm going to say I probably need to do a Saturday race because I would have to work on Monday and don't want to run 3 hours, then try to catch a plane immediately afterward on a Sunday (but we can see, I can be flexible if I have to - Myrtle Beach mini would be scenic and flat, yay!). Saturday races mean the Space Coast half or the Philadelphia half would work, but both are on the weekends surrounding Thanksgiving (11/28), so I don't know if they would fly. What about the Air Force Half in Dayton, OH on 9/21? I was hoping we could find something close to a couple of people in the group so maybe several of us could meet? Any thoughts from the group (if any of you are interested in trying to meet for a weekend...)? Batata, I'll have to ask about blood tests at my next visit. They just said I wouldn't get any tests unless I had symptoms (like the racing heart I've had on occasion, so I'm seeing a cardiologist tomorrow). ",

I'm also glad we got to enjoy your birthday hottie (thanks, Urdrago!). Maybe the physical race idea won't work, but we might be able to find a virtual race to run together... DebAL, sorry to hear your daughter is out of the house now. I know you'll miss her, but the empty nest thing is kinda nice, too (once you get used to it). So awesome that you got out and ran and felt so good this past week! I need to get my lazy butt on the treadmill, which is why I thought a race would be motivating for me....It's hard to hear that your neighbor with the recurrence is (was?) triple negative since that's my status. I'm guessing the tnbc is her new/recurrence diagnosis since I don't think they knew to check for hormone receptors 25 years ago? (I have a friend who went through bc 24 years ago and has no idea what type she was...she's also been fine all these years, with no rads or chemo - just surgery back then). If I can go 25 years without recurrence, I will be grateful. Batata, I'm with you on the Captain Crunch and Cocoa Pebbles. Before bc, I used to treat myself to Cocoa Pebbles or chocolate pop tarts (worse probably) on my Friday days off. Now I'm trying to be healthy so I don't keep them around. But I miss them! We splurged and had a Little Debbie choc cupcake this weekend, such a treat, lol.",

I didn't say a word to anyone except the friend I was staying with, who is a survivor. That was a tough weekend, I don't know how you managed for the length of a cruise!

With Mohs, they take a slice off, then set you in the waiting room while they check for clear margins on the tissue. He said it would be easy - 1 round, maybe 2 but he doubted it. Well, 3 rounds and 6 hours later, I have a beautiful path of sutures down the center of my nose, then sharply turning right and continuing down the nostril. My poor, battle-scarred body.

You have a right to be. This stuff is super rough on us - I am only finding out some things now as they come up. I know what you mean about anniversaries - I do that, too (relive them). I was surprised that my diagnosis date passed without a tear shed this year, but the actual date isn't set in stone for me so maybe that's why. First, I was VERY sure of the diagnosis by what the radiologist said on the day of my biopsy. Then, I read the pathology report that said \"carcinoma of the right breast\" because someone dropped it into my online records - before I was given the official diagnosis, which came 2 days later. So it's all sort of nebulous for me. Chemo? That's another story - started that on 4/20 and I think that's going to be a teary day (just thinking of AC literally makes me queasy). Hang in there! You are almost done with Xeloda! It's good that you can stop if you feel the need, but I totally understand the desire to push through it. Big hugs to you! ",

Also only the inner half of my eyebrows have grown back, but those babies are bushy (haven't seen that in years, either). I figure everything will fall out the day before we leave on our Memorial Day/my birthday weekend cruise, lol. Let us know how your lash serum works. So, I saw the PS today - a 0.25 inch hole opened up in my incision on Monday. It's been oozing for a couple of weeks (I kept thinking of Janice!), but the hole was a shocker. DebAL recommended I call the PS and he wanted me to come in ASAP (thanks, Debbie). He was worried that there was infection and the implant was compromised, but it turned out that the hole has internal skin between it and the implant so it's all good. He says my body encapsulated a suture or two and pushed them out. So he cleaned it out and dressed it. Meanwhile, I had found a small lump very close to where the original cancer was located, so I asked him to check that. He dragged out an ultrasound machine and quickly confirmed that it is fat necrosis. I love my PS! I have my MO visit next Monday, but at least I'm not freaking out between now and then. :)",

Also, I'm a dental hygienist - chemo shouldn't affect your teeth, however what I always highly recommend to my BC patients is to be sure to ask your dentist for prescription-strength fluoride for when you do your radiation treatments (they may have it on-hand for you to pick up or get them to call in a prescription). Radiation can slow your saliva flow, which can lead to more cavities. Use it daily, starting about a week before rads, then continue to use daily for a few weeks after rads. After that, I'd use it a couple times a week if you find your saliva flow isn't what you used to have, just to be safe. You might read the tips and tricks that are in the pinned posts at the beginning of the chemo section - I found them very helpful. I don't know much about the meds (I'll get my first dose next week), but I think the Taxol is \"easier\" than AC (if there is such a thing). If you look at the chemo as insurance against recurrence, maybe that will help? As for the port - I'm guessing you'll get one because of needing several weeks of chemo, but I don't know for sure. It's hard on your veins to have the chemo infusions, plus the port gives quick/easy access if they have to give you IV fluids or something during treatment. Hang in there, you've got this! Robin",

I can't speak about the meds you'll get because mine are different, but I just had my first chemo on Friday, so I can help with that. I wore sweatpants and a long-sleeved v-neck shirt (I have a port). If you don't have one, I'd suggest shorter sleeves. I brought a blanket and they also provided some. I'd recommend checking to see if your Taxol can have peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. My meds do, so I iced my hands and feet during my Adriamycin infusion to help prevent that, which is why I brought my own blanket. I ate normally the night before, but I wold definitely eat before you go in - you'll be there awhile. I brought snacks, they also supplied snacks, but your Dr may not. Drink, but watch how much you re drinking above your normal amount. I ended up in the ER because I forced myself to drink 3 liters of water in about 6 hours and had trouble peeing, which brought my sodium levels down. I'll lower that to 2 liters and drag that out through the day next time and will also add in some Gatorade. I'm taking Claritin because of my Neulasta (and Pepcid for the same reason), but you shouldn't need to if you're not getting Neulasta. I've been doing the 3x/day mouth rinse with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda and have had no mouth issues yet. Biotene mouthwash has been recommended a lot on these boards for any mouth issues. As for exercise, I'm a runner and I was pretty tired after the infusion. I would have felt comfortable to run, so I think you should do what your body says is okay for you. My MO says \"live your life\" so we went out for Mexican food last night because I wasn't having mouth issues or nausea, so I'll do it while I can! I'm keeping Zofran (for nausea) handy and taking it at night, but so far haven't had a problem with nausea, As for wifi, everyone was either sleeping or on their tablets while I was in treatment. I wasn't because I was icing my hands, so I brought a kindle that has text-to-speech and listened to a book. The one infusion was about 20 min,, the other was an hour, so you can go to the bathroom in between, There was about a 5-10 min gap between one infusion and the other, so you'd have plenty of time. My treatment room had a restroom right by the room. I can't speak to the Big D because I suspect my meds are constipating, but I've seen on the boards that Immodium seems to take care of it if you get it. RE: your reunion - I hear days 3-5 are the worst. I had my chemo on Friday (this is Sunday) and I'm fine, just feeling sluggish. Again, your meds are different, so YMMV. Good luck! astynanax66, no they didn't tell me about Claritin and general pain because I didn't think to ask. Did it help when you took the second dose of Claritin? I'd say if it's helping you, why not take it for the first few days? DebAL, I have tinnitus (ringing in the ears) today, I'm assuming that's the Neulasta. I know I read that someone else had it for a few days, I'll have to do a search to see what gave it to them. Other than that and feeling a little \"slow\" (less energy), I'm doing much better than I expected. Sure hope it continues! Silly question - how are you all counting your days? I had my chemo Friday - is that Day 1? Am I on Day 3 now that it's Sunday? Since I hear most people seem to have their bad days on Day 3-5, am I there yet or will tomorrow be acutal-full-Day-3 and I might still be doomed? Hugs to you all! <3",

Be sure to only suck on sugar free hard candy so you don't get cavities (which can happen in a hurry if your mouth is dry). While you have sores, watch out for citrus, spicy foods, tomatoes, don't use mouthwash with alcohol (Listerine). Grab some Biotene mouthwash (for dry mouths), some people swear it helps. Drink a lot, too, so you aren't dehydrated. Good for you that you could work out and golf in the same day! My fatigue hit yesterday. I took a few naps and went to bed early. Still managed to run/walk 3 miles, but not anywhere near the pace I'm used to. I was SUPER groggy this morning, but this afternoon is much better.

ElizB, my tinnitus is back (again, just in my right ear). The onco nurse says I need to tell the MO if it's still going on at my check in with him on Thursday because there is such a thing as ototoxcity and the meds may need to be adjusted. My ear feels slightly plugged, too. I was due for my routine chiropractic adjustment today (which I cancelled because I was feeling so yucky) - I wonder if that would have helped. My ear often feels like it has water in it when it's time to be adjusted. I'm only saying that because it might help you to get an adjustment if you see a chiropractor. Did you have any luck with your ENT appointment? FWW, the onco nurse says they count chemo day (the day it's given) as Day 1. Not that it matters! I just wasn't sure whether I could look forward to being through them if the bad days were usually 3-5. Sounds like I'm getting there. :) Hoping everyone's Monday was good!",

I'd love to go back someday. Listen, I opened a package of Activia yogurt this afternoon and thought of you! Have you tried taking probiotics to help with your thrush? This crazy chemo kills the good bacteria along with the bad just like an antibiotic does, which means your body/mouth chemistry is really unbalanced now. We always tell our patients to take probiotics along with their antibiotics to help counteract it. I'm not sure Activia would be enough, but you might try eating some daily anyhow. Definitely go to your grocery store or Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc and grab some probiotics from the vitamin/supplements section, though. Aim for something at least in the 20 BILLION range (higher is better) and get one that has a diverse blend of bacteria (I'm taking one with bifidus, acidophilus, and 8 others that I can't read because the writing is microscopic and I don't have my glasses, lol). Take them daily from now on and you might try doubling up on the dose for the first few days after chemo. They're bacteria, not a medicine, so it won't hurt you to double up. If you eat the Activia, try to coat your tongue with it and eat it slowly so some stays in your mouth for a few minutes, which should also help your tongue. Hoping that helps a lot for your next infusion. :)",

I'm happy (and a little nervous that I'm jinxing something) to report that I've sailed through today, which is usually my bad \"flu like\" day after AC. Man, I had terrible bone pain yesterday, though - I took a 2nd Claritin and regular Tylenol, which did nothing for it. Neither did a heating pad. I had to break out prescription Tylenol so I could sleep. The pain was gone this morning, but i wonder if the Neulasta kicked in sooner than usual and my counts didn't go so low, which is why I'm feeling decent (just tired). Who knows, but I'll take it!

Thanks for clarifying the bone pain. I'm picturing Neulasta-type pain, which I found debilitating and hard to imagine working through every week for 12 weeks. My MO swears it should only be pain that can be taken care of with Tylenol. Hoping you're both right! I'm glad your rads are getting lined up, too. It makes it easier to look forward to the plan, once you have one. Engine, I'm glad your wife is doing well, but I'm sorry everything has been pushed back another week. I'm sure she's anxious to be moving along, though I think it's good that they are delaying. Happy upcoming birthday! Frog, glad to help. I DO give reminders because I care, but I feel like I'm nagging (in my head). Enjoy your soda - just occasionally and with a meal! :) RE our fingers, mine are better, but still sore. I'm downing L-glutamine and hoping that helps. The nail beds just feel bruised, which isn't good when you're trying to floss 8-10 mouths per day and the floss hits right on your fingertips, lol. They haven't given me pre-chemo steroids to take for next week's first T, so I either won't get them or it'll be via IV. We'll see! Weekly T ladies - any constipation or diarrhea to look forward to?",

Sorry you feel yucky, but it's good news that they couldn't find the tumor or lymph nodes - yippee! I did a search for ALT/AST since I didn't know what that meant and I found this thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics... It seems like you can have a temporary change in liver enzymes due to chemo. Someone noted their T was reduced due to their high liver enzymes (this was on a different thread). Apparently T affects the liver more than AC does. Someone else mentioned their final dose of T was held a week due to high enzymes and their count dropped by 50 points just in that one week.Tylenol and some supplements (and alcohol) can also contribute to high enzymes. On yet another thread, the person was told she wasn't drinking enough water and that could raise her enzymes. I hope this helps you feel slightly less concerned... So sorry about the bone pain - I'm dreading that SE. Maybe Ibuprofen for it since Tylenol is processed through the liver? (yesterday, my onco PA said either Tylenol or Ibuprofen was okay while on T, but you should double check that with your MO. I LOVE my MO, but I don't really trust what the PA tells me since she says things like \"why are you doing neoadjuvant chemo?\" \"Umm, because I'm triple negative.\" \"Oh. Well, why will you be having a mastectomy?\" \"Because I'm triple negative with a tumor and a second area of abnormal cells in the same breast.\" \"Oh.\" Hello, shouldn't she KNOW this? She's got my flipping chart right in front of her!). Sending light and good vibes! ",

Fingers crossed for your next T on Thursday! I'm doing fine with T #2 - no SE's, except that I've been very tired since the infusion. I walked (dragged myself) about 4 miles through a park with a friend yesterday, then we went to lunch and that completely wore me out. It's aggravating, because that used to be nothing for me to do. Today, I'm spending the day on the couch, resting. The L-gutamine is helping - my nail beds aren't as sore as they have been. I get T #3 on Thursday. IngerP, I have no idea how you held a wedding at your house after treatment! Amazing. Happy 4th to y'all.

Hoping Miralax (starting day before) will do the trick this time. Life, you do sound depressed and getting out might help. Is there no compromise? Example: there's no way I could be at a concert for 5 hours, but I could go for 1 or 2 (especially if he brought a camping chair or something I could sit on). Would he agree to doing something, but for a shorter time frame or is all or nothing? I wouldn't do anything in a crowd right now (except, maybe outdoors), even though you're done with chemo. Your blood counts are still low, I'm sure. Also, there are plenty of threads that talk about people being surprised because their fatigue was worse after chemo. It's cumulative - it's going to take some time to get out of your system. I hear radiation really does a number on people and makes them more tired that chemo and for a few months after it's done, too. There's no way I could even think about Sturgis, but I DO go out to eat with hubby and do things with friends (movie night at a friend's, dinner out at a friend's, etc). For example: we went to a friend, they had pizza delivered, we sat and watched Netflix movies with them. You're getting out, but avoiding big crowds. If you don't like what they have to eat, don't eat it, bring your own. I just turned down an indoor concert last week, due to germs. I agree with Engine, talking to someone might help. I also know of some women who have temporarily gone on anti-anxiety meds or anti-depressants. We're fighting a battle her - it's bound to take a mental toll, as well as a physical one. What about a different, short vacation than Sturgis in August - just you and he going to a cabin in the mountains or going to the beach - somewhere you don't have to be super-active and face a lot of people?",

Lol, the MO said if they keep going up that slow, though, I should feel like myself again in about 40 weeks. Let's hope it doesn't take that long! InnaB, good luck with AC#4 - wishing for no SEs for you! Duffy, hoping your MUGA scan comes out well. Oh, no Dee - how aggravating that your visit was cancelled. I'm glad they caught you before you got too far, though. Bobby77056 and Naesha, welcome to the group. Naesha, I'm triple negative, too. For AC, be sure to take your anti-nausea meds exactly on time - don't wait for the nausea to start before you take it because it will take hours for the meds to catch up and stop it (it did for me, anyhow). Keep the meds in your system - trust me, it helps and also helps to keep food in your stomach. I munched on gingersnaps and things like crackers and shredded wheat biscuits. Taxol has been much easier for me than the AC was. Hang in there, you'll get through this. Engine, hoping this round goes well for your wife. Urdrago, I hope you are feeling better, pain-wise. Yay, half done with T! Just wondering, are you taking l-glutamine for your fingers? The onco nurse told me on Wed. that it helps a lot with the bone pain from T. I haven't had a second of bone pain on T and wonder if it's because I'm taking the l-glutamine? Also, you're getting a Granix shot, right? That might be causing your pain like the Neulasta did? Radiation - it's my understanding that we don't get radiation if we have a mastectomy? No one has mentioned it to me, except if I was to go the lumpectomy route, then I would have to do it. I am stage 1, though, so maybe your treatment is different because of your lymph node involvement? Congrats, Life - doing the no chemo dance. I can't wait until Sept. for mine. Thanks for the massage info - I wonder if that applies to getting a mastectomy, too? I'll keep it in mind. Dee and DJT, I've read that chemo tiredness often takes 2 months or more to get through. This stuff does a number on us! We have to let the blood counts get back up and get the crap out of our systems. Hang in there! Frog, definitely get a calendar and cross out those days!

Here's a link to info: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/Zometa... It won't give you problems with your teeth (that I know of), but you must be VERY careful with your oral homecare while you're on it. Floss, floss, floss - brush very thoroughly, avoid sucking on sugared candy (sugar-free ONLY!) and \"grazing\" (eating between meal snacks). If you do this, finish the snack quickly, then brush your teeth or at least rinse with Listerine and/or water to get everything off your teeth. Avoid sodas, sports drinks, lemonades, acidic drinks, except with a meal. The worry is developing cavities and then having those cavities turn into infected teeth that might need to be extracted. Bisphosphonate drugs have been linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw after tooth extractions (essentially, the bone in the jaw dies!), especially if given intravenously. \"Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported rarely in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including bisphosphonates. Many of the reported cases were associated with dental procedures such as removal of a tooth. Many had signs of local infection including infection in the bone. A dental examination with appropriate preventative dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates particularly in patients with additional risk factors (e.g. cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene). Invasive dental procedures should be avoided during treatment.\" **Note: I was told bisphosphantes should NOT be used for more than 5 years as they can start to break down the bone after that time. In fact, I've discussed this with several of my patients whom I've noted have been on similar drugs like Fosamax and Boniva for more than 5 years and have asked them to relay this to their physicians. Wonder of wonders, they've all been taken off the drugs once the docs realized they'd kept the person on the drugs too long. You wouldn't think the lowly dental hygienist should have to explain this to the docs...grr. Keep it in mind -5 years only! Good luck with your sleep. Maybe just resign yourself to using the anxiety meds temporarily (a couple of months)? I resisted anti-depressants for my out of control IBS a few years ago and finally gave in. It was nothing short of a miracle. I took them for about 2 years, then weaned myself off and haven't had the problem since.",

Also, I'm going to ask the BS about a direct implant after my UMX, but I suspect they'll push for tissue expanders and an exchange surgery down the road. How long were you out before you could return to work? I am having the right breast removed and am right-handed, so I was wondering how much that would affect my job as a dental hygienist during recovery. I probably raise my arms/hands to shoulder level during the day, but not much higher, but I do have to push a heavy xray head around! I hear 4-6 weeks recovery time and am thinking I might need the full 6 weeks if I'm not supposed to move my arms a whole lot. Urdrago, too bad that study isn't far enough along that we could volunteer for a trial. InnaB, I've iced during 3 of my 4 ACs and all 5 of my T's. I'll be happy to answer any questions about it! I haven't had a single second of bone pain on T - my onco nurse mentioned that my taking 30 g/day of L-glutamine to ward off neuropathy on T was what was keeping me from having it. She said those on l-glutamine don't seem to have the bone pain. I have also continued to take the Claritin D (daily) that I was taking while on AC. Believe me, I had Neulasta pain twice while on AC, I don't want that again, but T has been a breeze (although I'm getting it weekly, not DD). You might ask for your MOs opinion on the l-glutamine/bone pain (I wasn't taking l-glutamine during AC, so I am not sure it it would help the Neulasta pain). FYI, you'll need to have several ice packs available so you can swap them out every 20-25 minutes during the infusion. Ask your chemo nurses for a blanket because icing makes you cold all over (I wear a long-sleeved shirt and long yoga pants, plus have the blanket). Also, ice for at least 10-15 min before and after the infusion. Good luck! Engine, I hope Janice is doing okay. I could see where her prior chemo would affect her marrow. Did she just finish her #3 or #4 TC? Tough call - deciding whether to stop at 4 or go to 6. Good luck with your decision! DJT, as someone who deals with nervous/scared/introverted people who simply don't want to be in the dental chair, I second what DebAL said. Tell the nurse (kindly) that you would prefer no chitchat, that you are really uncomfortable with all of this and it would help you to stay calm if you could just focus on what needs to be done and not have to talk. I always understand when someone requests this. Some people aren't good about picking up cues from patients (I have 2 coworkers who would just chatter like squirrels without realizing the patient was struggling unless they were told). Healthcare workers understand, but we usually try the small talk thing first, to put people at ease. Clearly, that will backfire with you and they need to know that. At the end of the first procedure, you can thank them for not talking and request they put \"no talking\" in your treatment notes. Also, I would still (kindly) remind them at the beginning of each appointment until you've seen the same person a few times and you know they will remember. Big hugs, you can do this!",

Maggie2, so glad your exchange surgery hasn't been too bad. Thanks for the port info - I think I'll ask them to leave mine in until my exchange surgery. I hadn't thought of the blood draws, etc. Welcome, Batata, sorry you have to join us. I second Urdrago's advice - wear a face mask in the airport/on the plane, bring disinfecting wipes and wipe everything down - arms of plane seat, tray, headrest, etc. Then wipe everything down in the hotel room - tv remote, light switches, TOILET!, bathroom counters and faucet handles - everything! I do this even when not on chemo because I saw a TV documentary and you would be horrified to see how the maids clean rooms (one maid cleaned the toilet with her rubber gloves on, then used those same rubber-gloved hands to immediately wash the glasses at the side of the sink. Gag...). Also, get the name of a doctor or nearby urgent care/hospital at your destination and have it handy so you have somewhere to go if you suddenly become ill. Changing clothes after the airport is a great idea and bring plenty of hand sanitizer. Have someone else push elevator buttons and open doors so you touch nothing, wash hands after holding a menu, avoid buffets...drink lots of water, rest a lot. Good luck! Frog, so sorry you are in so much pain. I bet it's the Zoladex. Hang in there - at least you don't have to do this any more. One day at a time and this will be a horrible memory soon. Stupid cumulative effects. Urdrago, sorry you aren't feeling well either. I hope your stomach is better today. I collapse on the couch after work, so I know what you mean about being so tired. Some days, I feel like I'm 80. Hang on to your port through your surgeries (I'm going to). Like Maggie2 said, it's got to be better than trying to go through your arm when they do blood draws, etc. I have to do an MRI with contrast next month - I wonder if they can put that through the port, too?  For me, T #9, day 5 - I'm doing okay, just always tired. I'm so tired of saying I'm tired. I've had a little shoulder/neck pain this time - not sure if that's chemo or just that I haven't seen my chiropractor since this whole debacle started in April because I'm terrified he'll do something to dislodge my port. I also have an infected fingernail so I'm soaking it in epsom salts and chlorhexidine and putting tea tree oil on it. MO doesn't want to use antibiotics if possible (messes with the chemo). It looks better today, but who knows how much fun it will be to work on people tomorrow? <whines>. Wishing you all a good Sunday!",

We were going to go away this weekend for some R & R before my surgery next Friday and suddenly half my patents are coming in sick. We decided to cancel so I don't come down with anything that will postpone the surgery. Rest up and take care, you two! Urdrago, did they give you arm exercise to do? Keep up with them, if they did. A friend who had a MX says they did PT with her, you might ask about it. Nerves take a long time to recover/regenerate. In the dental world, we usually say whatever you have back at a year is what you'll get, so there is lots of time for some of that numbness to go away. DebAL, glad you're safe. Enjoy New Orleans!

I'm sorry you had to go through it, but what a relief.Thanks for the clove idea - I will have to remember that when cold season really kicks in. Hoping you feel better soon and that your cough subsides quickly (and that your radiation goes fast. You had 15, I think? If so, you're nearly halfway done. Feel better!). DebAL may have missed Hurricane Michael, but we're getting some of the storm here in Atlanta. It's been raining since about 6:00 pm, and is breezy off and on. The high winds and big storms are supposed to start around midnight and the whole thing will be gone around noon tomorrow. At least it's moving fast. ",

Lol, I can see where you might be putting the cart before the horse if they aren't even married yet, though. But, it helps to plan! Good golly, my back is killing me again. I was into the chiropractor twice last week and was still miserable every work day. He adjusted me after work on Thurs and I was great over the weekend. Went to work yesterday and I could tell it was coming back again. I was in pain by noon and spent the night on the couch to avoid keeping DH awake. I just wish I could figure out the problem. It will be good to have 4 weeks off for surgery, maybe that time will help it resolve. By the way, my fingers and feet are probably 85% better now that I'm 6 weeks PFC and I can just barely see the outline of hair around my face (if that makes sense).

I have barely made it downstairs to the treadmill in the basement lately, much less the gym. By the way, I got a massage last night which found a lot of tender areas everywhere in my body (chemo?). I wondered if a lymphatic massage would help you and the other ladies who are having problems with lymphedema? Just a thought. Ingerp, embrace those curls! I've had curly hair all my life - I am hoping for just having wavy hair after chemo, but we'll see. I bet your curls will relax a little if you let them grow out (but it's a struggle to get through that poodle stage, for sure). DebAL, it's hard not to think about this time last year. I'm so sorry you (and all of us) have gone through this, but I'm also grateful to have met you all. I was actually thinking along those same lines because my exchange surgery is scheduled for 3/1 and I went for my diagnostic mammo/ultrasound and was told I most likely had cancer last year on 3/9. Can't believe we've gotten through a whole year - especially since everything seemed to drag so much last year between biopsies, chemo, and surgery, We all rock for being so strong!

Also - it seems impossible that you (or any of us) could go a month without a doctor appointment, but girl, I am ROOTING for you! Batata, I hope all went well with your port removal. FWIW, I had my MO check up today (everything is good) and asked about the tumor marker blood test. He doesn't do them unless a patient requests it because he says they are too unreliable and cause needless anxiety when the counts go up. Like you, my blood test was normal last year when I was diagnosed. Glad you aren't stressing too much about it. InnaB, so sorry to hear about your job. You don't need more stress, that's for sure. Maybe retirement is an option? Also, don't worry about the exchange surgery - seriously, mine was a piece of cake compared to the BMX. No drains, I didn't need pain pills, dressed myself with no help, and I could move around without a problem (unlike after BMX). It is super easy, you'll be surprised. LIFE, I have trouble with my vision, too - it's all over the place. One minute I have super-vision, the next I can't read something that's right in front of me. Also, the pollen this year has really affected them (that's not usually the case), so maybe yours is partly from allergies? My eyes are very dry and I've been using something Frog suggested (Vita-Pos ointment), that has really helped my vision. It's definitely worse when I go a few days without using that stuff. It's basically lanolin and liquid paraffin, so look on Amazon or in the store for something with those ingredients and see if it helps. Hoping for no snow for you!",

Are you done with the trial drug? IngerP, I loved Costa Rica, too. We had a coatimundi (sorta of like a raccoon?) walking around by our door and fed monkeys bananas on a boat trip down a river. Too cool. You look great, enjoy yourself and get spoiled by that private chef! Edited to add: Duffyzmom, I forgot to say good for you for getting out and running. I really need to get back in the swing. We only climbed stairs on the ship and I thought my quads were going to fall off after about 4 decks, ha.",

I can handle some diarrhea and no taste buds. :) Although, I won't get to the Taxol until about 8-9 weeks from now. I'll do AC first, then T on it's own (or maybe with Carboplatin, depending on how the tumor responds) after that. I hoping the AC is the worst one so I can get it out of the way. I'm not sure about surgery yet, but I'm heavily leaning toward UMX. TNBC is aggressive so I hate to take the chance of leaving cells behind after a lumpectomy, plus I really don't want to do radiation. If you have it once, supposedly you can't have it again and I figured I'd save it for if this comes back sometime down the road and I need it. It seems like everyone else is doing relatively well, too. Yay! I'm REALLY crossing my fingers I'll be OK, too. If I \"only\" feel tired and like I'm coming down with a cold, I'll be thrilled. I've been reading these boards since the radiologist first told me my lump was suspicious and now I've become positive that I won't be able to get off the couch during chemo because it will make me non-functional. It doesn't help that I had a friend who passed away of stage 4 metastatic colon cancer two years ago and I saw how devastating chemo was to her body. I have to keep reminding myself that her dose/regimen was much stronger than mine will be. I read about drinking a ton of water, thanks for the reminder! Supposedly taking Claritan the day before, day of, plus for 5 days after Neulasta will help prevent bone pain (per the Tips on the chemo boards). For those on Adriamycin like I will be, sucking on ice chips or popsicles during the infusion helps prevent mouth sores. Biotene mouthwash will soothe and there's a recipe for another soothing mouth rinse in the Tips section. I also got socks and gloves that hold ice packs - for my hands and feet during chemo (it's supposed to help prevent neuropathy). Got my wig, cut my hair short! I get my echocardiogram tomorrow. We bumped chemo by one day, to April 20, for the first dose (because we had to bump the biopsy by one day). I'm ready to get started (so I can be done!). Robin",

Apparently the shot does something with our histamines, so the Claritin and Pepcid are anti-histamine. I got the non-drowsy versions and took mine this morning (my Neulasta fires this afternoon).

I felt like I couldn't see straight (couldn't focus), was very groggy and lightheaded, and exhausted. By the afternoon, it had started to change and I felt better. Today, I was STARVING (i was forcing myself to eat these past few days) and my temperature was normal (it's been about 97.4 and I've been freezing). So, my bad days were from Sun afternoon through Mon afternoon. I can handle that (except being so tired is tough). I still have the tinnitus - how are you doing with yours, ElizB? Okay, let me say it...constipation. Not sure if everyone on AC gets it, but holy cow... Next round, I intend to start off right and eat lots of fiber and take a stool softener. Nuff said.

I wore my wig for the first time today and people thought it was a new hairstyle (well...it kinda was, lol). I'm trying to stay positive and remind myself that it was falling out because the chemo is doing it's job. But, now I truly feel like a cancer patient...

I know what to watch for this time around. My second AC is tomorrow. The tinnitus is gone, so I bet it'll be back after this round. I know some of you ladies are having problems with metallic taste, so you're sucking on candy. PLEASE, as a dental hygienist, I'm worried that will give you cavities faster than you can imagine. Dry mouth plus the acids from sugar/candy will do a number on your teeth. Please use sugar-free candy wherever possible and be sure to floss and brush religiously/daily. For every candy you suck on, it takes your mouth 30-40 minutes to get rid of the acids. If you suck on them a lot, you can see how your teeth will be bathed in acid and get cavities quickly. Ask your dentist for a prescription fluoride to combat this and use it every day! For water flavor, I added several pieces of cut up ginger root after my first round of AC (buy it in your produce section) - helps with nausea and taste and there's no sugar in it. Maybe it will help you, too? Hugs to you all!",

I didn't go closer because I'd heard that made it worse, but you've encouraged me to try it. Frog, this is just my opinion on surgery, but since I'm also triple negative, I decided to have a unilateral mastectomy. There is a second area in the same breast as the cancer that has abnormal (although benign) cells and I don't want to take a chance on recurrence. For me, I wondered if a nipple-sparing procedure was an option or if that raised the risk, so I will ask about that when I have my surgery consult. Hugs to everyone!",

My MO had said he would if my tumor didn't respond to the AC, but he seems to have changed his mind now that it has shrunk and is only talking about T now because C isn't yet \"standard\" for treatment. He also knows I'm terrified of neuropathy because of my profession, so maybe he's being cautious? InnaB, you'll do fine when you start AC this week. This board probably has you well-prepared and we'll all be here to cheer you on! For me, the best thing I did was to keep a comprehensive diary every day during Round #1 and 2. What symptoms, my energy level, what I took for meds (Claritin, Pepcid, etc). Symptoms don't vary too much from round to round, so it really helped to be able to refer back to the diary so I knew what worked and what didn't when I went for subsequent rounds. Ask about possible constipation - a couple of us have had it from the chemo/nausea meds combo and it is not fun, so you might want to be proactive. DRINK a tone of water.

Thinking about you, urdrago, as you get your ALT/AST done tomorrow. Praying it's dropped significantly! NoteRed, we were in Athens several years ago and loved seeing the Acropolis. We took the train from the port - that was an experience (very crowded!). I want to go back and take a cruise around the Greek Isles someday. InnaB, you'll love the cruise when you get to do it. We saw several of the cities you were going to visit - loved the Adriatic. I'm sad that you didn't get to go - I was lucky my MO let me go on our cruise after my first chemo, but his concerns were the same as your doctor's - what would I do if I needed medical attention? NoteRed, re your question about splitting doses - my MO is splitting my Taxol into 12 weekly doses, but I had the choice of doing that or splitting it into 4 doses, given every 3 weeks. He said the SEs would be much easier to deal with if I did weekly doses, so that's what I chose. I imagine it would be the same with your FEC - more dramatic side effects if you do dose dense (when it's given every 2 or 3 weeks). If it's anything like the AC I did - keep a diary of your symptoms every day and what meds you took. Then you can refer back to it when you get the next dose (the SE's don't vary too much). I felt groggy on infusion day and the next day, but I worked both days and was fine. I was also nauseous the first 4 days. I felt like I had the flu starting on the afternoon of Day 3 (infusion day was counted as Day 1) and I stayed on the couch all day on Day 4. The \"flu\" lasted about 24 hours. I was also lightheaded and tired on those \"flu\" days. Take your nausea meds exactly as they tell you (it takes them forever to work if you don't take them and then find that you are nauseous, so keep them in your system). Constipation was a BIG issue for me on AC, so watch for that. I also got mouth sores after the 3rd and 4th infusions. Once I got into DAy 5, my symptoms lessened every day. If your FEC is being split into 6 doses, your SE's may not be as dramatic, though. Engine, so sorry about your wife, but I'm hoping she's better now.. I can relate - I've been super-constipated to the point of near-impaction on the last 2 ACs and this first T. I take 4 colace daily, have a capful of miralax every night (it takes me about 3 days before this kicks in), eat 4 prunes a day, eat bran muffins - all starting the day before the infusion and continuing until I'm able to go regularly (then, I just stop the miralax, but continue with everything else, every day). I haven't had to go to the ER yet, but I was pretty sure I was going to have to this weekend (thankfully, I didn't, but you don't want the details of how I stayed out of the ER). Be sure she's drinking at least 2 liters of water daily, too. LIFE, glad you enjoyed time with your sister! You're almost done with chemo - so happy for you! DebAL, glad you're doing well and that your hair is growing back. My eyebrows are now starting to depart, so I'm jealous that you're growing hair! FD, I asked my MO about changing my diet (Paleo, etc). He says to just eat healthy but not follow a specific diet, so I've just gone organic as much as possible. I've also reduced my sugar intake and will try to reduce my white flour/dairy once this is all done. Djt, glad you're almost done with your chemo - remember how scared you were and now you're at the finish line! Congrats! Love your snuggle story with your grandson. I'm on Day 5 of T #1 and doing awesome! I had a really great weekend. Fingers crossed it continues after T #2 on Wed... Hugs to you all! ",

Duffy, I hope you're doing okay with the blood thinners. Yes, Xarelto is newer, so it's expensive. You could ask to switch to Coumadin (warfarin), but you'd have to go into the doctor at least weekly (maybe more that the beginning?) to have it monitored and the dosage adjusted until they found the right dose. That was the drawback to the older style of blood thinners. That $50 copay might be worth it to avoid those visit, lol. For a clot, I'll bet they will want you on the blood thinner for at least 3 -6 months... Be careful not to take too much vitamin E, ginko biloba, or aspirin while on a blood thinner - they can thin your blood even more. Hoping your Neulasta pain is much better by now. Happy Canada Day!

      "Content": "Jul 22, 2018 01:27PM - edited Jul 22, 2018 01:45PM by GAWarrior Frog and Urdrago, I found this article through a thread in the surgery section and thought you might want to ask about it during your surgery consults. (Just scroll down to read it (you don't have to download it to read it)). http://www.academia.edu/22527938/NSAID_analgesic_k... ABSTRACT: To explain a bimodal relapse hazard among early stage breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy we postulated that relapses within 4 years of surgery resulted from something that happened at about the time of surgery to provoke sudden exits from dormant phases to active growth. Relapses at 10 months appeared to be surgery-induced angiogenesis of dormant avascular micrometastases. Another relapse mode with peak about 30 months corresponded to sudden growth from a single cell The NSAID ketorolac, a common analgesic used in surgery, is associated with far superior disease-free survival in the ﬁrst few years after surgery. The expected prominent early relapse events are all but absent. In the 9\u201318 month period, there is ﬁvefold reduction in relapses. If this observation holds up to further scrutiny, it could mean that the simple use of this safe and effective anti-inﬂammatory agent at surgery might eliminate most early relapses. Transient systemic inﬂammation accompanying surgery could be part of the metastatic tumor seeding process and could have been effectively blocked by peri-operative anti-inﬂammatory agents. In addition, antiangiogenic properties of NSAIDs could also play a role. Triple negative breast cancer may be the ideal group with which to test perioperative ketorolac to prevent early relapses. Basically, it's saying that the study found that the use of the NSAID, ketorolac (a pain killer), during your surgery, is associated with a dramatic reduction in recurrence of BC. I'm definitely going to ask about it during my consult and will insist that the anesthesiologist use it during my surgery. Here's the thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics... It also has info about getting a nerve block in conjunction with general anesthesia for your surgery, and that is supposed to reduce recurrence, too.",

I saw the 2nd MO in the practice before my chemo this week and she mentioned holding chemo for a week to let my blood counts come back up. NO! Thankfully, my primary MO okayed #6. Really hoping I don't lose ground again next week. I'm tired, but I really just want to get this over with and not be held a week. And I'm really trying to avoid a transfusion. I've read that transfusions can accelerate cancer growth and/or recurrence, so who needs that? Urdrago, great news that your tumor has shrunk and lymph nodes, too. When they did my genetic testing, they tested 28 genes, but I see that ptpn12 wasn't one of them. Which other ones will they test you for? Glad your hair is growing back. You are 2 Ts ahead of me so now I can look forward to that in a couple of weeks. DebAL, thanks for the aspirin info and the info on direct to implants. I didn't know it might make you smaller! At this point, though, I just want to be higher, lol (less saggy). It's good to know about not going back to work before 6 weeks - I think I should do that, too. You're right, it isn't worth compromising my results. Maggie2, thanks for your info on direct to implants. I guess I don't understand why they would bother with expanders for prepectoral and not just stick an implant in the empty skin from where the breast tissue was taken. Maybe the weight of the implant impedes healing? Clearly, I need to do more research! Frog, I'm glad you are feeling better this week. Interesting about the opiod pain killers and mets, thanks for sharing. As I mentioned in a prior post, I am reading about using the ketorolac NSAID and a nerve block during surgery, to help avoid mets. It makes you wonder what else they think might lead to mets... Engine, how is Janice doing after round #3? InnaB - yes, it would be nice if the entire medical community was on the same page. Good luck with that, lol. You'll do fine with the icing. It hurts like heck for the first 15-20 minutes until everything gets numb, then it's not bad (until you switch to the next ice pack and start the numbing all over again.) My gel packs might be different than yours - the ones for my feet last about 30 minutes each, the ones for my fingers about 10 minutes, so I've been wearing very light socks on my hands and just sticking them in a tupperware bowl full of ice. That works well and my fingers stay cold the whole time. Fdwithfurkids, enjoy your vacation with your mom now that the irrigation is taken care of. Relax!! djt, thanks for sharing the story about your friend being 5 years cancer-free. Sometimes even a year from now seems so far away. We have been through a lot and look at how strong we all are! We rock, :) Ingerp, 8 days to go now, yay for you! Wishing you all a great, SE-free weekend. Hugs! ",

Keep in mind this from a report I found: \"Breast imaging has failed to reliably assess pathological response to NAT (neoadjuvent chemo): the correlation between tumor measurements by physical examination, imaging (mammography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and tumor size on final pathology analysis is modest.\" It's frustrating not to be able to talk to your MO this weekend, for sure, though. I wonder if that means you will be doing rads after your surgery or if they will they treat you with Xeloda? Or both? I've seen several studies that show Xeloda can make a big difference in women with residual cancer after chemo (especially us tnbc women). I'm worried about not getting a pCR, too, and have already primed my MO to discuss Xeloda with me if I don't. The biggest SE from Xeloda is hand/foot syndrome (not what you want to hear, given your problems with your fingers on T). It's a pill, so it's supposed to be easier on you. In any case, good luck with your final T tomorrow! Sending big hugs! DebAL, sorry you were up with Urdrago and me a few days ago. I would have definitely come over if we'd been neighbors. Hoping you are feeling better after your exchange surgery now, although I know the sorest days are usually the first few days. You'll look cool in your spanx even if you aren't cool, lol. Engine, so glad Janice is doing better and her fever stayed down. FDwithfurkids, can't wait to try your hair recipe! InnaB, glad you are feeling good. You'll get through this!",

I really debated on getting #12 today due to neuropathy - I can barely stand to touch anything with even a slight texture, my fingertips feel so raw.

Mine is similar. I'm doing what I want to do now - taking it easier than I used to, putting my feet up more often, reading, etc. Good for you that you got your teeth cleaned. Bone takes awhile (several months) to fill in after an extraction, plus we don't heal well while on chemo, so it will probably take you longer than normal. Thanks for the recipe - I probably need to stay away from that cake, but it sounds yummy, lol. Did you get your CT results yet? InnaB, you're on the downhill side now - just 5 days to go until you're done with chemo. Yay you - you've got this! Engine, hoping for good news for Janice's MO visit today. Batata, when do you finish chemo? Next week? I thought of you yesterday when a patient of mine who is about my age asked me what I had been doing in the last 6 months to smooth the skin on my face. It surprised me because I think I look horrible and she thought my skin looked great. Whatttt? Anyhow, I told her I figured the steroids made my face puffy so any wrinkles smoothed out and that I didn't recommend chemo for a beauty treatment, lol. No botox indeed!! (Also, sadly, I share your sweet tooth. That said, enjoy your celebratory chocolate cake when you're done with chemo and congrats for walking every day!). Interesting to hear about the neuropathy/fainting info. Frog, so glad you're done with surgery and on the mend. The hookwire placement sounds awful despite the anesthesia. Not something you want to sit through when you just want to get the surgery over with. Wishing you a quick and easy recovery! Happy weekend, everyone!",

I'm doing okay after T#12 - woot, I'm 1 week PFC! It was awesome not to have to fill my cooler with Ice and tromp off to the MO for chemo this afternoon. I had really bad bone pain yesterday - I suppose it was chemo's way of telling me it was still in control and I don't get to celebrate too much yet. Happily, the pain was gone this morning. My fingers are slightly better, my feet still feel like I have socks bunched up underneath them, but that seems to be mostly when I get up after sitting awhile or first thing in the morning. My eyes are crazy dry but tearing at the same time - I almost couldn't see to drive on Monday. I still have nosebleeds daily. I'm still tired, I'm still weak, but each day should get better from here. Re life reassessments - we're seriously considering downsizing. We looked at townhouse this past weekend. It would be a big change from a large house to a townhouse half the size, but I think we may do it. I want to get started weeding out all the junk we've accumulated over the years. I pretty much decided to retire at 62. I've also decided I'm taking more \"me\" time to do things I want to do, instead of pushing myself to get some project done.. Thanks for listening to my rambling and for your support. Not sure who I missed - I don't mean to ignore anyone! Hugs and positive vibes for hair growth for y'all!",

Sooo much bone pain in my back, I finally gave in and took a hydrocodone at 12:30 this morning after 800 mg of ibuprofen didn't even touch it at dinnertime. I was at the chiropractor on Monday, so I have to assume this is from chemo. .I did a search and some people are saying they got bone pain for months after PFC. Someone said her MO told her it was because our blood cells are depleted and our bodies are scrambling to make more cells. Oh joy. Oh, and can I just say that I'm tired of wonky vision? My eyes are blurry on and off and super dry. Okay, end of whining for this morning... Nice pic, urdrago! :) Engine, loved yours, too (loved Office Space)! Enjoy that stapler, lol. InnaB, hoping your birthday was nice (if quiet). Urdrago, 4 of my my nails lifted, but I didn't lose them. They had clear fluid leaking from them and smelled awful for awhile, too (sorry if TMI). I used tea tree oil on them and still keep them very, very short. Frog suggested wearing gloves and that helped when rinsing dishes or cleaning in the kitchen etc. I used bandages on them while at work because even catching them slightly on something meant drop-to-your-knees pain. I am keeping OPI nail strengthener on them. Happily, they are still tender, but definitely better 2 weeks PFC. I bumped one at work yesterday and only winced instead of wanting to pass out. Oh, and they are green under the nail now (my sister showed a pic of them to her holistic doctor friend who thinks it is fungus and will grow out). Sad to say the neuropathy often will last for months PFC, though. HikingLady, hoping your hives are gone! Life, hoping you are feeling better. I am seeing lots of colds in my patients already.

Also, your feet, fingers will HURT until they get numb - hang in there, it gets better. I gave myself a quick break (3-4 min) when it got to be too much.

I felt the same and was really worried about T, but it was a breeze compared to AC (except for the neuropathy concerns). Be sure to keep letting your MO know what symptoms you are having so they can make treatment adjustments if needed. Good luck! Maggie2, I hear you - the Atlanta airport lines are no fun, lol.

No worries, I've gotten to the point where I don't care (except when I'm standing in the stock room at work, knowing I'm there for a reason, but can't remember what I'm supposed to get, lol). Nails - doing okay. 2 of the 5 green ones are grown out now, 2 of the remaining three are almost grown out. I still have neuropathy in my feet (\"bunched up socks\" feeling). A friend got me a spiky mat called a Spoonk that you are supposed to stand on, barefoot, for 15 min/day to help with neuropathy. I did it with socks the other day and literally couldn't walk for awhile afterwards. Gotta work up to the time apparently. It's been awesome for my back, though - takes the pain away after work. I started PT on Friday for my back, hoping it helps since I'm wearing a back support at work now <eye roll>. TEs - my right side is slowly deflating. My exchange surgery isn't until 1/18 so I'm worried things will shrink and the PS will postpone it. I'm supposed to go in for a fill, but everything I can get to without disturbing my own patient schedule is booked until Christmas. Also, I'm having a basal cell skin cancer removed from my nose with MOHS surgery on Friday. I figure I need to get it done in this insurance year. And, I haven't been through enough this year, so I thought I'd add to it, ha. Life, what a suit! You totally look like the Michelin man! Have a great week, everyone!",

Like you, my vision was blurry towards the end of T, plus my eyes were/are very dry. I still have trouble switching focus from close up to far away and I can barely see out of my right eye since I've been here in Colorado's dry climate. I have an appointment with a retina specialist in Feb (detached retina in my right eye before all the cancer fun started). I'm thinking I should see someone well before that, though. Bryce is home and doing well. He has a cough from the fluid in his chest and left lung, but the home health nurse was here today and says his lungs sound okay. We've been out getting supplies (like a blood pressure monitor!) and his endurance is good. He's frustrated about the restrictions. I think 6 weeks before driving and resuming a more normal life is seeming like a lifetime from now for him.",

I wish none of us had to be here. astyanax66, I'm in GA with you. :) I was diagnosed with TNBC in the right breast last month and have been waiting to get test results back before starting anything. They're calling me stage I (1.7 cm) with no nodes involved, but won't know for sure until I have surgery. Because I'm triple negative, they're doing neoadjuvant chemo before surgery. My MRI showed a second area in the same breast, so I am having an MRI-guided biopsy on Monday to check it out, then will start chemo on Thurs (19th). We do one round, then I leave for a cruise that's been planned for over a year (I'm not missing that, especially since I REALLY need a vacation after the past month of life kicking me in the face). I'll get Round Two in early May when I come back. I've been reading the chemo boards and have gotten a ton of great tips from the pinned posts at the beginning of the section. My oncologist says I'll be able to work (mostly) through chemo - gosh I hope that's true. I've been anxiously waiting for a treatment plan so I can get started, but now that I have it, I'm getting scared. He's treating my chemo as if I'm stage II because TN is a more aggressive type of BC. I'm starting with AC for 4 rounds 2 weeks apart, with a Neulesta patch added to the mix, then will get Taxol every week for 12 weeks (possibly with Carboplatin added to the mix). Surgery to follow that. Oh joy! Good luck to everyone!",

Hubby's going to do my buzz cut, too. He and I will have the same hairstyle for a few days, lol. Thank you all for letting me know that clear urine is okay. I really thought I was going to see pink or orange for a few days. I ended up in the ER last night because my sodium levels were too low, so let me say that you should drink, but not overload yourself like I did. I drank 3 liters in about 6 hours (trying to keep my heart/kidneys/bladder flushed out), but I could only pee out about a cup of urine every hour. Hubby dragged me in to the ER (I protested), but he was right. An IV of electrolytes made it all go away and I feel pretty good today (until Neulasta kicks in this afternoon?). The ER doc says A is processed by the liver, so no amount of water is going to speed it through. He recommended alternating water and Gatorade to keep electrolytes balanced. Also, djt, regarding your teeth - I'm going to backtrack and tell you to start using a prescription fluoride during chemo if you feel that your mouth is dry (because mine is very dry today). It won't hurt you to use it for a longer period (just check with your onocologist first), but it will help. You can get those little brush things (https://www.amazon.com/3612H-Proxabrush-Go-Between...) (pic below) and dip them into the fluoride gel, then work them in between wide spaces or under bridges or between implants to ward off gumline decay. udrago71, you mentioned that your tumor is already shrinking. How did the DR know that? Do I have another ultrasound to look forward to in the next week or so? Hugs and happy weekend to everyone! ",

I'm getting ready for Round #3 AC on Tuesday so I've been feeling great and the constipation has subsided. Yay! But, I'll be back to square one the day after tomorrow. Boo... Udrago that's awesome about your tumor shrinking! And, you picked a nice place to recover, although I'm sorry you're back home due to SE. It's interesting that your MO would consider shortening the number of T infusions from 12 to 3 (even if it meant making the does 3 times stronger). Is that the only option - 3 weeks or 12 weeks? That's a huge difference. I mean why not do a double dose for 6 weeks? I'm curious because my T is just around the corner, too, and I hadn't thought to ask about changing up the regimen. I'm scared enough of the SE for that one (D, neuropathy, altered taste) that I wouldn't want to push it, but... In fact, I was wondering if my MO would agree to give me another round or two of AC and take away some T! Frog, so cool to be discussing the future after chemo even if it is about surgery! Moving on, right? I figured out that I'll be a quarter of the way through my 20 weeks of chemo this week, woot! RE food choices: for frog, Dee, FDwithfurkids, etc - I think I saw this posted earlier in this thread, but for Mother's Day my daughter gave me the cookbook, What to Eat During Cancer Treatment, from the American Cancer Society. You can get it online at Amazon. It has 100 recipes, divided into symptoms (so some for if you have diarrhea, some for constipation, etc). It has a whole chapter on recipes for taste alteration. For metallic taste, it suggests using plastic utensils, adding lemon juice or vinegar to veggies to mask bitter or metallic taste, using more sour foods like pickles, cranberries/juice, sauerkraut, using feta or parmesan, marinating meats in barbeque sauce or italian salad dressing or teriyaki sauce or using eggs, dairy, beans, peas, nuts, or nut butters or high protein pasta or bread as alternative proteins if meat tastes bad. It says to avoid your favorite foods during this time as you may find you hate them when this is all finished because you associate them with the yucky taste after chemo. I hope this helps! (And here I thought T was going to be a breeze compared to AC. Maybe not!). Djt, I hope your mouth is better. I've been taking a Bcomplex and an additional B12 supplement this round and had no mouth sores at all. I'm on AC, not your CT (although the C is the same), but maybe increasing your B vitamins (or adding B complex) would help? Also, I know you'll hate me, but coffee is acidic and may be contributing to the fungus...(sorry!). postiveinohio, have you read the thread about icing your hands and feet during your infusions? I don't have experience with T yet, but I hear this helps with neuropathy as does the glutamine. Definitely tell your oncologist so (s)he can change things up for you! Good luck! Have a good week, everyone! ",

If you are claustrophobic, when your head goes in - know that the machine is lit from the inside, they will give you headphones to listen to music, and you can close your eyes to help. They also give you a panic button to use if you get really upset, but the procedure very doable (says the person who isn't claustrophobic). You'll get an IV if you're having contrast (likely?) I had one of my biopsies done via MRI and I'd totally rather have been in the tube, closing my eyes and relaxing on my back rather than lying on my stomach with the girls hanging down and being compressed in a grid while they stuck needles in me, lol. InnaB, I never had problems with my taste or appetite - I think the taste thing happens more on T, so I'll keep you posted as I go through it. AC effects were sort of cumulative -I was more tired and for longerwith #3 than the first one (I'm now anemic, with low wbc to boot), but they were also easier to manage because I knew what to expect. We'll see what #4 brings - my \"flu\" usually comes on this afternoon and lasts until late on Friday. leli, congrats on getting your last T this morning! Now, you just gotta ride out the SEs one last time! Hoping your hives get better asap. Robin",

My fingertips have been feeling bruised the past two rounds of AC (despite icing during the A infusion), but my nails are super-strong. Hoping that doesn't change on T. Thanks for the bag balm idea, DebAL. Djt, I've been taking B6 and B12 and have started L-Glutamine in preparation for T, thanks! I'm glad to hear that icing is working for you, too - I plan to do that for T. You all have me worrying about T and bone pain now! I'm already worried about neuropathy, drat it all. I've had neulasta pain twice on AC and it was pretty unbearable. I can't imagine it going on for a couple of days every week. Not to mention the exhaustion that seems to come at the end. Oh well, I'll get through this, right? The dental hygienist in me cringes to hear you all talk about drinking soda, flat or otherwise. Please don't do this as a between-meals hydration plan. Sipping on soda (or water with lemon) is a quick way to Cavity-land. I get it - nothing tastes good, but try to limit the soda to meals only, when your mouth is already acidic. Same for tea with sugar - just walk away... Sorry to be a party pooper, but I don't want you to get through this only to find out you have dental problems afterwards. :) LIFE, maybe the Opi nail envy would help your splitting nail? It's a nail strengthener. Urdrago, how are you doing? Dee, I hope your eosinophils have resolved by now. LIFE and Engine's wife -good luck with chemo this week! Hoping everyone else does well this week, too, whether you are getting a treatment or trying to bounce back from last week's infusion.. ",

Duffy, I knew you had the edema, but never thought that would be from your neck! Sorry you had to see the downer doc, but I guess it was worth it since you figured out the problem. Hoping the blood thinners will take care of it pronto. NoteRed, I occasionally get flashes and have had floaters (spots on my eyes) in my right eye since I started chemo. I had a torn retina in the same eye about 18 months ago, so I thought it might be from that but the retina specialist said no, it's the chemo. I also notice temporary vision changes (trouble adjusting from close up to distance). Hoping it's temporary! If the ophthalmologist dilated your eyes, they should have seen any tears which is what usually causes flashes. I bet it's the chemo.",

I've read it can be from the T, but since I've been so tired this time, it worries me. They'd better give me my infusion today! Djt, I'm so sorry you had such problems. I think this whole experience is going to give us a ll some variation of PTSD at some point. I freaked out on the office staff when my PCM wanted to see me before referring for a surgical consultation, then had to apologize. I just couldn't handle one more doctor appointment at that point. Big hugs to you! NoteRed, so glad you seem to be doing better with the FEC! Watch out for constipation (the anti-nausea meds can do it) - eat lots of fiber (prunes) and take stool softeners or use miralax or smooth moves tea if it starts. It is wicked to try to resolve if you don't keep on top of it. Urdrago, I'm excited to try eyelashes now! Mine are so sparse. I read about someone who had one eyelash left and applied mascara to it every day just to feel normal. Lol, I completely understand. And, I'm bald everywhere, too. My body looks like it's regressing back to my childhood days, if you know what I mean. Frog, loved the light bulb moment! I've done the same thing. I was excited to see my hair color was on sale last week, then it hit me...no hair. Ugh. Engine, so glad your wife is doing well! FWIW, I'm still constipated on the T, so it must be a SE of something (steroids, Benadryl...). I'm not taking Zofran for T, but that can cause it. Off to work, I'll catch up on posts later today.

I'm not interested in the flap reconstructions - they just sound so much more complicated than I want. Life, so glad that you and your BF talked it out! I thought he was probably trying to look out for you and see that you had some fun this summer. People just don't understand how much of a toll this takes on us. I've known several people with cancer and never had a clue until I've been dealing with it myself. Duffy, sorry you aren't feeling well this round - hoping you're better now. Frog, so happy to hear you are feeling better! Yay for finishing T#7! Hoping for minimal SEs for you. Engine, good luck to your wife on Wed. Get that miralax in her. :) Molly, I wasn't given a choice in treatment either, due to my triple negative status. I did 4 DD AC (every 2 weeks) and am working my way through 12 Taxol now. Frankly, none of the chemo drugs are good for the heart. Also, radiation can increase the chance of cardiomyopathy, heart disease, and heart attack (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/can...). What other choice do we have, though? Before they started my chemo, I had to have an echocardiogram. Maybe going through the results of yours with your MO would help you made the best decision in your case? Also, I try to walk or do a slow jog a couple of times a week to keep my heart strong during chemo. It's tough, though - like LIFE mentioned,Taxol is zapping my strength. Best of luck with your decision. Djt, I've had watery eyes since AC #2. The MO put me on steroid eye drops. They help a lot. I know you're done with chemo, but I take them the day before through the third day after the infusion. Maybe something like that would help you? I also have a hard time transitioning from close up to distance vision - it takes a few minutes for my eyes to adjust, but they are very blurry until they do. Like, Engine's wife, I have bad post nasal drip, too. It's a super good thing I wear a mask at work because my nose just opens up like a faucet at the drop of a hat, lol. I'm looking forward to T #4 on Wed (1/3 through T after that one, woot!). Urdrago, I think you're getting #6 on Wed? Good luck! Have a good week, everyone. :)",

(I thought of you this morning (actually, middle of the night) when I was up and down with hot flashes, which seem to be happening far too often now - ugh). I'm so, so excited for you that you only have to endure wonky ports, infusions and SEs one more time. Engine, how's Janice doing? InnaB, thanks for clarifying re: l-glutamine. I go for T #8 this afternoon, so I'll ask about it. I don't want it to interfere with absorption of the chemo, but I reduced my dosage this past week and immediately got a mouth sore (l-glutamine helps those as well as with neuropathy), and I haven't had the SEs in my fingers that others have had. I wish MOs were all on the same page. Urdrago, good luck with you T #10 tomorrow. Keep growing those fuzzies! Mine are not cooperating - I don't see anything growing up there... :( On the happy side, my niece gave birth last night to her first baby, a girl they named Arya. She had a high-risk pregnancy from the start - many weeks of bed rest, bleeding off and on (prior miscarriages), then pre-eclampsia the last few weeks. Arya is healthy and her vitals are strong.

I have GOT to remember to ask them to cut down on the steroids. I sleep well the day of chemo due to the Benadryl, but every flipping Thursday night, I'm awake for hours. Ugh. Anyhow, I'm doing well - same ol' SEs - sore fingertips and hot flashes and being tired once I'm not wired from the steroids. This time my feet seem to feel \"hot\" on the bottom. I chalked it up to icing yesterday, but I'm still feeling it now, which can't be good. I do have to say that chemo brain has kicked in. I think of something I need to do or discuss and it's gone from my mind almost as soon as I think it. Very frustrating, but I'm trying to write notes to myself (not that I remember to read them. Or where I put them. HA!) Weeedie, congrats on T #9 - almost there! Urdrago, I'm super jealous about your hair. I'm checking in the mirror daily and my stubble hasn't grown (and there doesn't seem to be any more of it either, more's the pity). I'm sure you've been noticing growth since at least T #7 or 8. Glad you only have 2 more to go! RE: surgery - are you going with MX? I wondered because you mentioned spending a night in the hospital. In my mind, lumpectomy would be outpatient, but I have no clue. I have my first surgery consult on Monday. LIFE (Julz), glad to hear you are feeling stronger! Funny, I've been looking around the house and thinking of all the things I need to get rid of once I'm done with chemo and have the energy. I forgot to tell everyone that we had to put our 15 year old cat down last week (he rallied like Duffy did, but finally got too weak), so I also now have a ton of kitty things to get rid of, too. Hubby took care of the litter boxes, etc, but I have to clean that room really well and drag out the carpet cleaner, etc. Then there's our store room in the basement...and my walk-in closet... I totally get what you mean about getting rid of baggage. FdDwthfurkids, thanks for explaining your scans. SO EXCITED for you! That second scan looks awesome now that I understand it. You're doing great! InnaB so sorry you are suffering so much on T. I wonder - could you switch to the weekly dose instead of DD now that you've started as DD? Weekly hasn't been bad at all compared to AC. Sure hope you feel better soon! Frog, so glad you are doing better and that your port has healed. I bet you can hardly wait until Monday and #12. :) Timetobebrave70, I haven't had problems with thyroid or liver, but I know urdrago71 had elevated liver enzymes. She was taking tylenol for bone pain while on Taxol and both are metabolized by the liver. When she switched to ibuprofen her liver enzymes went down. She'll have to tell you more...good luck! Engine, hoping Janice is getting better every day now that's she's past her one week. Hoping her temp stays below 100.4! Have a good weekend, everyone!",

Let the hair commence it's sprouting! I'm glad you'll be doing an MX eventually. With tnbc, I feel like that's what we HAVE to do (regardless of stats saying lumpectomy is the same recurrence as MX), so now I won't worry about you having \"just\" a lumpectomy. No, I didn't have chemo brain on AC (although hubby might beg to differ). I think maybe I have it now due to the lowered RBCs? Or maybe just because I've done 16 weeks of chemo now? Hard to believe it when I think about having made it through 16 weeks of this crap... So, I had enough steroids left after a whole 4 hours of sleep to walk/lightly jog 3 miles this morning (feet are feeling fine now). The house is sure empty without my kitty though. We had to put our other one down in February, just before I was diagnosed. Cleo was 16 and had a stroke one night. Having our Boo around made it a little easier to cope with her loss, but I really miss them both right now. Congrats on your T #10 - 2 more to go! You rest up, too - happy weekend!",

I liked him and what he said matched a lot of what I wanted. I'll get a preop MRI and mammogram in mid September, then surgery in mid October. He wants 6 weeks out from chemo to give me a better chance at healing. I was going to do a UMX, but need to do something with the unaffected breast to make it more symmetrical, so I'm really thinking hard about a prophylactic MX on the other side since I'll need surgery anyhow. Thoughts from those of you who have had a MX and/or preventive MX? Happy with your surgery choice? Would you do it again or change anything?

No apology needed, you're going through this just as much as we are and we know you're very worried about Janice. If this helps, my PA told me to stop taking my temperature 3 times a day like I had been doing since I started chemo. She said temp spikes are normal and you can take the temp a few minutes apart and get a difference in temps. She said if I was neutropenic, I'd know it because I would feel yucky and have the corresponding temperature. That made sense to me. If Janice felt good and wasn't worried about going to the ER, maybe it's because the antibiotics are working and she didn't really need to go (a \"trust your gut\" thing)? I'm sure she's so tired of seeing the ER. Fwiw, I had temp spikes within the week after chemo almost every time (just below 100.4) and it was because of those stupid hot flashes we get. Good luck to you both!  DebAL, thanks for the thread info. I'm a small person, too, sounds like we have similar ideas of how we want to look (ummm, not Pamela Anderson, lol).",

I've read posts where it hasn't hit people until months after they've finished treatment. After diagnosis, we're just heaved into the fire, so to speak, and it takes awhile to realize that this is the new normal. I'm anticipating falling apart after my double mastectomy surgery in Oct.

Do they know why you keep getting the clots there (since your port is gone now)? Frustrating week for you - enjoy your trip home and that R & R! Deb - no more crazy hours! You need to reduce your stress not add to it. When they ask you about taking something on, just walk away...you can do it! You and Maggie getting haircuts - imagine that! I'm sooo jealous. I vow to never fuss about \"having\" to get a hair cut or color again when it comes back. Ingerp, go you! Moving right through the rads, congrats! Do you ring a bell when you finish that, too? RE: the hair, I'm with you. I want to ditch my wig and scarves, but it's going to be a while. A long while, I'm afraid. I was super-blond as a kid, so I suspect it will come back blond and will be hard to see until it's 6 inches long. Maybe that's you, too (blond)? WDW, how fun! When will you be there? I'll be there the first weekend in Nov - we should find a way to meet if you're there at the same time. Frog, good luck at the RO visit tomorrow. Hoping your joint pain settles down and your eyes clear. It's spring there - maybe allergies are contributing? I've wondered about that with my eyes being so dry and my blurry vision. It's been unseasonably warm here and ragweed (a big allergen) is blooming longer than normal. Maybe it's a combo of allergy and chemo? Did I mention that I'm growing eyebrows? They are barely there, but they are there. My eyelashes, however, are not. I had them all through chemo and now they've abandoned ship (probably went searching for my hair). My back pain is better. I ended up going back to the chiropractor yesterday after 22 hours of unrelenting pain. He thinks it's nerve-related due to the chemo (uncommon, but it happens). The MO says it's not from chemo. I disagree, lol. I'm better today, so we'll see if it comes back (last week, I had it three days in a row). I read that since we are now off steroids, these ugly little things that were suppressed are showing up. Makes sense. In other news, I had a mammo and US today (MRI will be on Monday). The radiologist says I have \"mottled\" tissue (areas of dark and light tissue) remaining in the tumor area, but nothing definable that she can measure. She says it now comes down to the surgical pathology report to say if those areas are live cells, dead cells, or what. She was very pleased. Me, too! Have a great weekend, ladies and gent! May it be SE-free and relaxing!",

Maggie, no one said anything about taking my port out during my BMX next week and I forgot to ask. Taking it during the exchange surgery sounds like the way to go in case there is residual left after surgery and I need more chemo (God forbid!!!!). DebAL, I've been thinking of you in the hurricane path. If you haven't already, go get some bottled water (enough for a few days) and bread, lunchmeat or whatever food you can eat without heating in case of a few days of no power.

I had a second area that they found in my first MRI, in addition to the tumor - the biopsy came back benign but atypical, which is when the MO recommended at least a UMX. Being triple negative, I'm having both done, because I worry I'll have more areas like you did. Anything to cut down the chance of recurrence. Frog, glad your fingers are better. So sorry about your anxiety. Life's idea bout playing music sounds good - I hope you can do something like that. Let the rads people know how you are feeling so they can help you deal with it. Congrats on your bravery to go topless. I'm still at the stage where I'll scare people, lol, but it seems to be growing in noticeably more every day. Life, thanks for the suggestion to look up stretching exercises. Yes, I really do think my back pain is stress. Yesterday, I was distracted at work by a pair of cute boys (ages 8 and 6, don't start thinking bad about me, lol). They were so much fun to have in my chair and we were talking about Halloween nd football while I was cleaning their teeth. Suddenly I realized my back didn't hurt because they distracted me. So, I'm practicing keeping my shoulders down (yep, they were up around my ears, ha!). Maybe yoga, like DebAL just mentioned in her post... DebAL, welcome back! Glad you had fun on your \"adventurous\" vacation and that the hurricane didn't mess up your plans too much.",

I'm doing well after my BMX last week - just laying around, watching movies and being spoiled by DH and DD. Oh, the PS took out my port, too. I don't have much pain anymore, just some annoying pulling on the stitches and itching. And, my breasts are completely numb, so I'm having some areas that itch but I can't scratch them because they're numb, if that makes sense. No amount of scratching makes the itch go away. Nerves waking up, I guess. My pathology came back with no residual cancer and a clear SNB. I'm very happy and very terrified at the same time, This means I'm about to be released with no further treatment to make me feel like I'm actively working to keep this from recurring - it's just sink or swim and \"good luck to you.\" Life, I am totally feeling ya right now - I'm in the Negative Nelly boat, too. Maggie2, that's exactly how I feel - abandoned! Being cooped up and not able to do much isn't helping either. Okay, rant over... Ingerp, have a blast at Disney! Life and Frog, love the hair! I'm super jealous! I finally have dark hair coming in among my peach fuzz. I also have eyebrows again and lashes that are very short. Frog, yours are beautiful, as are your eyes. My lashes were never as thick and long as yours before chemo. Maybe they'll come in better now. :)  Life, thanks for the warning about stitches and not pulling them. Big hugs to you all.",

Normal is 1-3mm, any numbers higher than that indicate that the gum attachment to the tooth is being affected. The bone around the tooth drops as the gum attachment drops which can lead to tooth loss. If the pocket is too deep, they do gum surgery to slow/halt progression of the gum disease. I would tell you not to do any surgery unless the pocket is deeper than 6mm. The big thing is keeping the pocket clean. Daily flossing and/or a waterpick is great for that. Engine, it must not have been this group (but I thought it was) where someone did a hyperbaric oxygen chamber a few times. I don't think that's standard after surgery, though - just something that was extra to help for their condition (I wonder if it would help Janice if she's still draining?). Or maybe I read about it on one of the surgery threads (I'm in the Oct surgery group). In any case - not standard. And that's a hard NO to posting pics of fluid from the drains on twitter. Wayyy too much info, lol. Glad to hear the fires are starting to be contained. Frog, how nice that your hair is long enough to be unruly - go you! Mine is mostly flat to my scalp, but with random long hairs that stick up everywhere. Still, I'm happy to see ANY hair, lol. I wish it was warm enough for swimming here, enjoy the pool when you can. Good luck with the Capecitabine - wishing no SEs for you. Life, I'm glad you're seeing a counselor. We've been through so much, I'm sure it will help you. I do well for a while, then recurrence possibilities get in my head and I start worrying. It's tough to get this all out of your mind. Good luck with your liver enzymes! I remember that urdrago had high liver enzymes when she was on chemo and was taking a lot of Tylenol (I think?) for bone pain. When she switched to something else, they came down fairly quick. Maybe that's what is affecting you? Urdrago, glad the first rads went well. I start back to work on Monday, too - not looking forward to it. I've gotten used to sleeping in and napping! I saw the MO 2 weeks ago and don't see him again for three months. We talked about me taking metformin to help against recurrence, but he convinced me it's overkill since I had a complete response. Of course, then I came across a woman online the other day who had the same tnbc/stage/treatment/surgery as I, PLUS she had rads - she also got a complete response and then relapsed 13 mo after surgery. So I am back to worrying. DebAL, sorry you're in the midst of an ice storm. And here we thought it was freezing at Stone Mountain when it was in the 40s last weekend, lol. Yes, the time flew by, but it was awesome to meet you! Stay warm. I saw the PS on Monday and got my stitches out. I'm cleared to drive, wear a bra, and do arm exercises - yay! We set the date for my exchange surgery on 1/18/2019. Stay safe if you are beginning any holiday travel this upcoming weekend. Big hugs to you all!",

The first thing half of my coworkers said when I went back to work after my surgery last week was \"you look so good, you have color back in your face.\" I always felt I looked sort of gray during chemo, apparently I was, lol. It makes sense since I was super anemic. I am sure it is so hard to keep plugging along with treatment, especially rads since you go every day. It must seem like you've been there a million times and still have more to go. Once you get through rads, you'll be on the downside and headed toward the finish line, though. Hang in there (and stay warm!). DebAL, I'm trying meditation, too. So far it's hit and miss. I do it one day, then don't get back to it for several days. There just isn't enough time in the day for all the things I want to do (like the treadmill). Thanks for the integrative medicine info. What? 6-8 cruciferous veggies/day? Ha! I'm unlikely to get that many in a week. I also need to learn the difference in foods (Ie: organic vs natural, etc). I'm eating organic fruits/veggies now and cage-free (sometimes also organic) eggs.and natural or organic meat. I'm still getting nowhere near the fruit/veggie servings per day, though. InnaB, good luck going back to work. That will be a big adjustment after being off for half the year. But, traveling is worth it!",

I was 4 months PFC yesterday. There's a lot of gray in there, so I tried using a semi-permanent blond hair color on Friday. Clearly, it didn't take well, but now I think I'm more white than gray.

The mammogram missed mine - the only reason I knew there was a problem was because I found a lump. Can you believe they would actually tell you NOT to do exams? SMH...

      "Content": "Mar 2, 2019 08:54AM - edited Mar 2, 2019 08:58AM by GAWarrior Dleon24, Welcome, but I am sorry you are here. It's understandable to be scared - we're here if you need to vent or have questions. I'm still scared and I'm on the other side of tx (worried about recurrence now). I am also triple negative (stage 1, 1.8 cm tumor and had clear lymph node scans). I was where you are a year ago. I had the same chemo you will be getting (4AC + 12 T). I had a port placed and I HIGHLY recommend you get one. Adriamycin is nothing to mess with - the chemo nurses will come at you looking like a hazmat team. It is very toxic to the skin (they will also drape you before giving it). For me (but you must make your own decision), having to get poked 16 times (weekly with taxol) wasn't something I wanted to do, plus I worried about blowing out veins after so many IVs. A member in this group didn't have a port (InnaB?) and had a lot of trouble with her veins toward the end of her tx - hopefully she'll chime in with her thoughts. As for chemo, the infusions were no problem - no pain and you just hang out watching a movie on your phone or reading. Sometimes people bring someone with them to talk to. See what your facility looks like as that was a problem sometimes in mine (too few chairs and no privacy). Your MO should be able to tell you what side effects (SEs) to expect and when you'll get them. For me, I got the AC infusion on a Tues afternoon and could feel it hitting like I was getting the flu on Thurs afternoon. By Saturday afternoon, I was feeling better. You will be exhausted a lot. They can handle the nausea with meds. Keep a chemo diary and record your symptoms (day they came and day they left). My MO says the symptoms don't vary much, so you can plan around them if you do this. Look into icing your hands and feet to help with neuropathy (they tell you you only need to do this for T (taxol), but I did it for all infusions and still had some problems with neuropathy). Despite getting neuropathy, I think the icing helped. Hair loss started about Day 11 after the first AC, it was coming out by the handful at Day 15 or 16. As for traveling, TNBC doesn't play around. Some forms grow very fast, so waiting 65 days to treat may not be the best thing for you (although your tumor was removed - not sure if that changes things). I was in the same boat, I really wanted to take a cruise that had been planned for a year and, although my MO was against it, he let me go but insisted on giving me one chemo tx first (my tumor was not removed until after chemo). Then, while on the trip, I had to drive from my home to the cruise (no flying = germs) and DH touched EVERYTHING for me (buttons, doorknobs, light switches, etc) so I kept germs to a minimum. You MUST be scrupulously clean and avoid germs as much as possible. Wear a mask - I'm not joking. My MO had me go to an urgent care at the first cruise port and get blood work done/faxed to him. He also made me take cipro as a precaution. I'm not saying this to stop you from going, but telling you it is very serious if you are somewhere and you get neutropenia. He said to have an escape plan so that you know where a hospital is if you get a fever because it can get bad very quickly. This group had a couple of ladies who were hospitalized with it. Just saying, if you go, be very careful - I went and was so happy to be doing something normal in the midst of the chaos. Good luck to you! We're here to help if you have more questions. :) I second Ingerp's recommendation that you look for the March, 2019 chemo thread. It is VERY helpful to go through this at the same time as other ladies who can share experiences so you know what is \"normal\" and what to expect.",

Not how yo wanted to spend it, I'm sure. InnaB, congrats on your upcoming cruise. It's so nice to have that trip to look forward to. Alaska is on my list of places to visit. Even though I lived in the Rockies for almost 20 years, I hear that it doesn't compare to Alaska. Can't wait to see a few pics! Linda, I'm sorry about your trial and PT visits being delayed. I thought I would tell you that, while I'm not seeing anyone (I probably should), I find that I am very weepy lately. Everything brings me to tears (heck, writing this has me teary). I also seem to be preoccupied with \"what ifs\". Example: hubby and I talk about something we'll do in a couple of years and my mind automatically jumps to \"if I'm still here.\" It's so stupid, but we have been through so much, I am quite sure there is some PTSD involved, not to mention depression and anxiety. And, you're right - while going through treatment, I was in survival mode - get through the biospy, get through AC, get through losing hair, get through surgery, etc. Now that I am done, it's like I can let go, and those feelings I held back can swamp me sometimes. I'm glad you're getting help. (PS, look up cording stretches on YouTube. They might help until you can get another appt). Oh, and I have my chemo curls, plus yours, lol. I look like a poodle! I sort of liked my hair better when it was super-short, but I'm trying to get through that weird stage so I can do something with it (see? Getting through again, lol). Also, - side note about Arimidex - I have a patient who is a 9-year survivor. She was in recently and mentioned that she will be done with 10 years of Arimidex in August. Her fervent hope is that the joint aches go away. She says she feels like she's had arthritis pain all this time. I say this because maybe a lot of the pain you feel is drug-related and will come to an end eventually. I'll try to remember to update this in a year or so (!) to let you know if I found out how she's doing. Sending warm vibes to you all!",

Either way, I'm sorry that you have to see him at all. So glad you will be getting the textured implants out. No sense raising the risk even slightly. And, you may be right that we'll suffer with the pollen more this year due to chemo. I read that we have a high chance of being allergic to foods, medications, etc that we never were before (sorry if I read that here and if I am repeating myself- I totally forgot where I learned this!) - I was given Keflex to take as a preventative after surgery and had an allergic reaction within 2 days (never was allergic before).

I use Clairol Natural Instincts (the box says no ammonia and 80%natural ingredients. You can see the labels on Amazon). It's semi-permanent and seems to do fine as long as I use a darker color. I was blond before (in the 8 or 9 range on the colors that you see listed on the box) but that normally means they use peroxide or something to strip the color so that the dye takes. This hair dye won't do that (strip it) (in my experience). Blond did absolutely nothing on me, so I had to use the 7 range (light brown) to get it to take. It's easy to color your own hair at this length, just get a mirror to be sure you got all of the back covered. It washes out in about 6 weeks (with no roots, like the permanent colors give you). Cut off a bit of hair, then color it in a bowl before you go for the whole head. That way you know if it will do something weird on your head (like turn your hair orange). Engine, glad to hear that Jillian is doing well. I only had problems with Taxol with my feet and fingers, but I had weekly doses. I imagine DD would be much tougher. And, it all wears you out. I swear I am more exhausted now than I was back then. Just realized the anniversary of my first chemo is this Sat, 4/20. So glad to be on the other side of THAT!",

Symptoms like that can come and go even years afterward. I try to stay off Dr. Google because I am ME, I am NOT a statistic and I can go down a rabbit hole very easily with Dr. Google. As for the lung nodules, there are many reasons for you to have them and most reasons are benign causes (a past infection, inflammation, scar tissue, etc). More than 90% of nodules that are less than 2 centimeters (like yours) are benign (it would have to be over 20 cm to fall into that more worrisome category). Keep in mind that you went through rads, which can cause lung nodules, and chemo can cause them, too. Try not to worry (I know it is SO hard not to).

Meanwhile, you all should be aware that bisphosphonates can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (death of the bone) with certain dental procedures - especially if given via IV. My dental journals say: \"For patients taking these drugs, good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are essential. Prior to starting bisphosphonate therapy, addressing existing dental issues is a best-practice strategy. Generally speaking, if routine dental treatment\u2014such as prophylaxis (teeth cleaning), fluoride carriers, dental restorations, or dentures\u2014is indicated, no special precautions are required for these patients. However, if more invasive treatment is needed, such as extractions, periodontal surgery, or surgical root canal treatment, use of bisphosphonates should be delayed for a month to allow sufficient time for bone recovery and healing.\" Wishing all the moms a very Happy Mother's Day!",
