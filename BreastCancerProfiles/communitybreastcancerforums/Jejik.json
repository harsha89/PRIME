And you can't start working part time until once you are already recieving disability. Being able to work ten or so hours a week is very different from being able to work full time and support yourself. Best of luck in making your decision!!",

My oncologist told me that I should look at this like a gift from God, and I do. But knowing that the Lord givers and the Lord taketh away gets me super anxious sometimes. But I have never wanted anything more in my life for this baby to be born healthy and for me to be able to watch it grow. Cool breeze, I don't think that sounds terrible, especially coming from a mother who worries about hanging on for her son's sake. I didn't mention it, but I am married to a wonderful guy who is already an awesome father to two girls. This baby will have him and two half sisters and lots of extended family that loves it besides me. Maybe it is selfish of me but I cannot imagine giving the baby up for adoption. Just as no matter what doctors said it never crossed my mind to terminate.I already love it do much, and want to be a part of its life for as long as possible. I am doing the journal thing so that if the worst does happen the baby can at least know how much I loved it and what I am like and my thoughts on things. I am just wondering how to cover it all!! I hope to get to know y'all better as I navigate the site more. Thanks again.",

LuAnn, to answer your question, the last time I had a PET scan in August 2011 I was NED, and since my liver is still clear, I am hoping I am still good. I have had so much breast pain, I sometimes worry about a local recurrence, but I think it is probably just my breast is getting bigger, and stretching out my lumpectomy scar. I feel so blessed since I hadn't even been on herceptin a year when I had to stop it. Not to mention that one of my doctors told me that getting pregnant was the worst thing that could ever happen. Names....Oh my goodness. Having such a hard time. I was convinced it was a boy, and had what I thought was the perfect name picked out (Lincoln), but a girl seems so much harder! I have a list of about 20 names, ha ha. Some of the contenders: Beatrix, Moxie, Esme, Lucia, Mokino (japanese word for possibility/hope), Rhiannon, Flannery,Charlotte, Ione, Naureen, Adia...Any input suggested...although my mom has already told me my names are all weird, so I am well aware of that, lol.  Hope you all are having good weekends.

I have been having a lot of shoulder pain myself. I have chalked it up to my breast getting bigger, and the effect that is having on the lumpectomy site and where they removed the lymph nodes. I have also noticed some cording I didn't have before. Are you seeing your oncologist at all during your pregnancy? Even if not, it is probably worth giving him or her a call!",

Like someone else mentioned, I am not sure though, that putting off your second opinion is necessarily the best choice. While I am sure for your peace of mind, it will be good to be close to him, I am not sure a day or two will make a difference to him, especially if he is experiencing psychosis. I have bipolar disorder, and have been in more than one mental hospital...in varying degrees of mental upset. I know that it usually takes more than a day or two to be stabilized, and they usually cannot or will not give you a diagnosis right away.Visiting hour is usually just an hour, and depending on one's mental state at the time of that hour, sometimes a patient cannot even see their visitors.Also, if you were my mom, I would really want you to go to the second opinion. There just is so little you can do for him at this point, I feel like what you can do is take care of yourself. But you are a mom, and I know how my mom is, so...all the best to you in whatever you decide. Lastly, it does seem quick to rush to a schizophrenia diagnosis. I know that psychosis can happen in other mental coditions, including bipolar. In any event, if this is some type of mental illness, I encourage you to check out your local chapter of NAMI...the national alliance on mental illness. This is an organization founded by family members of people with a mental illness designed to provide education, support and resources to those living with a mental illness and their family members. It has been an invaluable support to my mother and I. They also have a national web site NAMI.org. Please keep us posted.",

I know several people who work part time after receiving disability and still receive disability, but I don't know the differences or similarities in your case versus theirs.

Today I had a checkup for my pregnancy and the nurse, who I had never spoken to before started asking me all these questions about my breast cancer...how I found it if I had to have a masectomy...on and on and then she asked what my prognosis was. Not because it was relevant to what she was doing...she was just unhooking me from a monitor. Wth? Who asks someone that because they are curious! I just said well there is no cure so i will eventually die from it but with new therapies women are living longer and longer. If I didn't have to go back there every week I think I might have gotten sarcastic with her. It just seems so insensitive. It is funny because I switched to this OB office two months ago because the ones in my other practice always wanted to comment about my cancer, and i felt like they werent focusing on the baby. These docs know that, and have never even said the word cancer to me. Maybe that is why I was so taken aback by the nurse's prying. On the other hand, I try to chalk up such experiences to helping educate people about breast cancer. Do any of you ever look at it that way? Never thought I would have to educate a nurse though.

The good news for you is that they have caught it as early as possible. You won't have to do chemo, even better! Check out the DCIS forum for a better idea of what you are dealing with and the treatment options. Honestly though, as scary as this all is, the fact that it was caught at such an early stage is truly a blessing. Hugs to you!",

It is so terrifying to think I won't have a chance to teach my daughter all the things and values that I feel she will need to know in life. And I haven't even met her yet. I always get frustrated when others say they know how I feel, or when my husband says well I could Die before you or someone says no one knows what time we have. I think unless one has a terminal illness like we do they will never understand how we feel. But people always want to say they do, I have never gotten that. Just like I don't like people comparing their situation to mine, I try not to minimize other people's feelings who are in a situation that is objectively not as \"bad\" as mine. I think people only know what they know. And someone always has it is worse. But that gets hard when people say things like \"I know exactly how you feel.\" To three little girls, that is a great idea about asking a few of your friends to step up so your kids can have a wide array Of influences. Thanks for sharing. Seems like the mods have been trying to work on some of the problems, I hope the problem with stage Iv forum gets fixed sooner rather than later. I",
