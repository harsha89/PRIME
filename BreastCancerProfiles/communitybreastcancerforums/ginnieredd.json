A couple of months ago I started itching between my breasts and on my right shoulder. I quickly developed a rash. I just happened to have an annual visit with my plastic surgeon already scheduled.  He advised me to use a 1% over the counter cortisone cream which does work - only the rash keeps reappearing and I itch at least 3-4 times a day. My plastic surgeon says that the rash is caused by the radiation working itself out of my body from the inner layers and core. I have never heard of this and I can not find anything on the internet related to problems this late following radiation. I would love to get rid of this incessant itching once and for all. Do I qualify?",
