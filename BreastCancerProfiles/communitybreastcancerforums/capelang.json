After going online and doing some investigating, the \"night sleeve\" I was given is the \"Solaris Caresia Arm Bandage Liner Sleeve (Wrist to Axilla). I matched the product number from my package that the sleeve came in to the product number shown on the website.  My sleeve has no glove/gauntlet built into it.  Just goes to wrist.  Website shows photo and infor. http://www.hightidehealth.com/solaris-caresia-wrist-axilla-liner.html Solaris makes another line called Tribute custom nightwear showing a padded sleeve with built-in gauntlet.  http://solarismed.com/products/tribute I'm thinking I was given the wrong item. There is a little more to my story.  I didn't tell you I'm a flight attendant and have been for 26 years.  So after my first diagnosis in 2009 (4 lymph nodes removed - same surgeon) until my second diagnosis in May 2013, I have been flying weekly/regularly for 4 years for my job with no sleeve because no-one mentioned it.  I know many other flight attendants who don't wear a sleeve because since they had 3-4 lymph nodes removed no-one has ever told them or me that the pressure change on the aircraft can cause lymphedema even if you only had 3-4 nodes removed. So I've been lucky and now want to have all my ducks in a row to do whatever to be proactive.  I want to prevent but I don't want to make things worse. Last night and today I didn't wear any sleeve.  I'm going to make some phone calls Monday to get some things straightend out. All my surgeon said was to get fitted for a sleeve and wear it when I got home from surgery.  I don't think he really knows about the glove and night time garmets.  The prescription he have me was for \"lymphedema sleeve\".  The Women's Center where I got my sleeves called his office and had the nurse practioner fax an order for the gloves, gauntlet and the supposedly night sleeve.  He is being proactive but there is a gap between him and the Women's Center. I didn't realize until I read on-line and from others that responded that you really shouldn't wear the sleeve alone.  If I had the correct night time sleeve with the built in gauntlet, I would just wear that for now. Anyway, I'm going to post this message I'm sending you and see what others have to say. Thanks again, you help means alot. Mandy  ",

      "Content": "capelang wrote: Hi All, I just applied for SSDI.  I am 56 years old.  This is my second breast cancer.  Recurrence Stage IIIA.  4/7 lymph nodes.  I have had a total of 11 lymph nodes removed if you include the first surgery. I have not worked in the past 12 months.  I am on LTD with my company.  I am a flight attendant and obviously can't work on an aircraft during chemo, surgery and radiation.  You have to be 100% to work. My LTD has now been extended through 7/31/14 because I have lymphedema.  My case is mild swelling and I've been wrapping and fitted for customized sleeve and night-time garment but my LE Therapist says I shouldn't be flying while I have swelling.  I only fly turnarounds 10 days a month, but that is 20 flights in a month.  More than the average person.  My LE sent LTD a very thorough letter explaining my condition and LTD extended my absence. LTD sent me a letter saying \"We have completed our review of your medical and vocational information and determined that you are currently disabled from performing any gainful occupation\" and state that I am \"required\" to apply for SSDI.  If I do not apply, they will average my SSDI benefits and offset it with my LTD benefits. I applied 4 days ago using an Advocator.  SSA called me the day after I applied to verify my info.  I'm hoping that this is a good sign. Anyone been approved with Recurrence or Stage III or for Lymphedema?  I really can't see myself flying again now that LE has appeared.  I'm afraid it will get worse.  Got a copy of my company's requirements for flight attendant duties.  It states things like - push, pull a loaded beverage cart weighing 250 lbs.  Lift above the shoulders 20-40 lbs.  Open, close aircraft door weighing 40-60 lbs.  \"I don't think so\"!!! Please tell me I have a good case!!!!
