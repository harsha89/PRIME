I don't know how to choose on the 2week vs 3week thing. I don't feel super aware of the costs/benefits. Did your MO mention if you would have a break week or two between treatments?",

I will go back and find the cryotherapy studies I read from the last couple years about taxol and AC, but I have been wearing cryotherapy packs on my hands and feet during treatments (I've only had 10 taxol so far). So far I haven't had much neuropathy pain/symptoms and strangely the only thing I have noticed with my nails is that they have grown more during chemo than they have ever in my life. I do have autoimmune issues so maybe that has just always affected my nails and I have never known! May be worth a shot to try the ice packs 15-20 minutes before, during, and after chemo for those with neuropathy and nail issues. ",

I had a terrifying allergic reaction to the T yesterday and was told I will just be given injections to prevent the reaction with each of my 12 rounds of T. Had my port put in yesterday too. I am icing my feet and hands to prevent neuropathy. I found some recent studies that have shown cryotherapy may help while taking T as well to prevent neuropathy. I also have an autoimmune disease and don't want this cancer to cause any additional issues for me long term. Just curious to see if anyone else had reactions. Thanks to everyone who is sharing their stories!!",

She just gave me the option of doing AC every 2 weeks with the shot, or AC every three weeks with no shot. One obviously puts me getting through this more quickly which is definitely a strong desire I have, but it requires shots for white count. Do any of you have advice? thank you in advance!",
