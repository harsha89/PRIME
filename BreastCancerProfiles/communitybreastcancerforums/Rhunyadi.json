I guess I'm just curious to know what everyone's symptoms were? My underarm and breast has hurt for close to 3 years and has come and gone but it's been constant for around 2 months now and is just getting worse. The pain isn't in just one spot, there is no lump, and radiates from the front left breast to the back of my shoulder, and then all the way to my left hand. Is this a symptom? I just don't get it, I've taken antibiotics a few times and the pains never gone away so I just need to get into see a Dr about this. I'm just wondering if any of these symptoms sound familiar to anyone who's been diagnosed? Log in to post a reply",

I'm in such a hard place because I don't have insurance so going and making all these appointments just isn't something I can do it'll all take time. At the ER they honestly have no clue and I imagine they arent really trained on cancers and symptoms of certain ones. But they did mention seeing a neurologist because of the location my pain is centered in. I know 100 percent something is wrong I mean I just feel it. My whole left arm is in so much pain, going numb, shooting sharp pain up and down from my shoulder to my fingers. Idk what to do I'm just lost. I need help, where do I go from here? See a neurologist or a see if I can get an appt at a cancer treatment center since they know exactly where to look?",

I remember clearly when it began because I went to an urgent care to get my lung checked, I figured something was in my lung or something. They just brushed it off and really did nothing. I guess I will make that neurologist appointment and see how that goes.",
