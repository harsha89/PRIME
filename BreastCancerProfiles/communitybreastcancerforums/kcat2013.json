I received my first round of chemo in a private room and most of the rest in the large room. I liked the privacy for the first chemo because I was so nervous, but also liked seeing other patients in the large room. I chatted with a few patients that were on the same chemo schedule as me (but for different cancers) and I looked forward to seeing them each time and comparing how we were feeling. The Benadryl/Ativan combo would knock me out pretty quickly or at least impair my cognitive function enough that I only chatted with others for the very beginning of the chemo session :) My husband went with me each time and I think he liked seeing other spouses/caregivers. I also witnessed an emergency once early on in my treatment and although a bit scary to watch, it made me feel even more confident in the nursing team after watching how quickly and professionally they handled the situation. My MO's practice moved to a new building fairly recently and the set up is similar except there are curtains around each chair that can be closed if desired and individual TVs for each patient.",

Unless your husband has given you reason to believe he is truly bothered by your new chest I would assume he just can't handle the medical side of it. Although we, the breast cancer patients, are right in the center of all the aftermath of cancer treatment we have to remember that our loved ones are also trying to deal with our diagnosis and treatment. Sometimes that means giving them a bit of space to process everything that is happening and not rushing to judge their actions or lack of them. However, if your husband is not loving and supportive of you in general then I'd disregard everything I've said and give him a swift kick in the pants. Hugs. Kendra",

She was great, I was dealing with cording and the therapist got that worked out plus evaluated me for signs of lymphedema. I wish I could go back to that therapist but she's out of network for me now. I saw my PCP yesterday and he thinks it's probably just more fun related to the mastectomies and reconstruction. So I got a referral to another physical therapist. Hopefully that will get rid of the burning/tingling/shooting pain. I can deal with the additional numbness, it's the pinging pain that drives me bonkers! Thanks for responding! ",

I got the oncotype results back before the FISH. Oncotype was 54. FISH then came back positive. Interestingly, oncotype said I was Her2 negative, but my MO said FISH trumped that. Even though the oncotype should not be used in treatment decisions for Her2 positive patients, in my case it provided a bit more info for us--info that made it clear that chemo and herceptin were good choices for me even though I had a very small tumor. As barredowl pointed out, the oncotype test should not be used to determine Her2 status. So I would be leary of following your 1st MO's advice using the oncotype as a guide on that.

It's firm but move-able and it feels like it's directly under the skin. The lump isn't visible just palpable. A few days after finding the lump I happened to have a regular check up with my MO and mentioned it to her. She felt it, said something about it being too small at this point for a PET to pick up and told me to watch it and let her know if it changed in size/shape. She said if it got bigger she'd refer me to a surgeon to have it removed to see what it is. She also mentioned something about it might be caused by something autoimmune and said the name of it but I promptly forgot what she said. I already have a couple of autoimmune conditions and they tend to piggy back on each other. Anyway, the lump hasn't gotten any bigger in the 6 weeks since then but a few new lumps around it have showed up. Has anyone had experience with lumps in this area of the body being cancer? I really really don't want to call MO and deal with having a surgeon remove them if they are benign. My feeling (like that actually means anything, ha!) is that they are nothing cancer related.

They should know best if an excisional biopsy followed very quickly by mastectomy is the best course for you. I also agree with others that have said not to rush ahead, especially since you have no actual pathology on your lump that definitively says that it's malignant. Doctors can sometimes make us feel that we absolutely HAVE to do things on their timeline, when the reality is that isn't imperative to our health. So don't feel afraid to sit back and say WAIT, I need to have a little bit of time to absorb this and explore options. I was 34 when I was diagnosed so I do understand the feeling of urgency to get things taken care of. But I still had 3 weeks between diagnosis and surgery, which was just enough time to explore my surgical options and reconstructive options and meet with the medical onc. All of my team of doctors felt 3 weeks was reasonable time to wait--they wanted surgery done quickly but not so rushed I didn't have a chance to know my options and have all the scans done that they wanted pre-surgery. Good luck. Kendra",

It's kind of to the side and next to the back of the toilet. So my husband fixed that by hanging a roll of toilet paper on a hanger in front of the toilet so I could reach. So I'd just take a look at where yours is situated in relation to the toilet :)",

It can detect things a mammo or ultrasound doesn't. The MRI will probably help the surgeon with her recommendation of how to handle your breast that the tumor was removed from. Kendra ",

I had an elevated heart rate throughout chemo (particularly during the AC portion) plus periods of racing heart beat and shortness of breath. When it first happened my MO immediately postponed chemo and sent me off to a cardiologist for a work-up. Everything checked out fine. Cardiologist and MO said it was a result of the massive amounts of steroids given with chemo plus the general physical toll chemo takes on your body. For me once I was done with chemo my resting heart rate returned to normal and the racing heart episodes and shortness of breath went away. Keep in close contact with your MO and cardiologist about this, but hopefully it will resolve once you are done with chemo. ",

When I was in the tube she sat at the end and talked to me to let me know she was right there and I could see her in the mirror thingy. When I was out of the machine and the Dr who did the biopsies was working on placing the wires and taking the samples, the person stood right next to me. She even gently massaged my arms and held them still when they got to shaking like mad from being in the same position for so long. Honestly for me the MRI biopsy was a really rough experience, HOWEVER, the techs and Dr were amazing and made it tolerable and made me feel like a hero for getting through it :) I think the key was talking to the Dr before we got started about my concerns (I have rheumatoid arthritis and it's very painful to stay in those contorted positions) and then continuing to talk to them throughout the procedure about how you are doing--and if you get a good Dr like I did they will check in constantly with you to make sure you are OK.

They chose to not use the cancer word with their kids because their kids had no reference point as to what cancer even was. So they told the kids something similar to what Tangandchris did. It worked out fine for them, their kids knew mom was sick and needed medicine and surgery to get better. Kendra ",

Because of this I was pretty sure my kids would think the absolute worst if we didn't get them the facts right away. I was right, my 6 year old started sobbing immediately about me dying as soon as he heard \"cancer\". So thankfully we were able to reassure him and give him the facts about my diagnosis. I shudder to think what would have happened if he would have overheard the info about me having cancer from someone else. Kendra",

That might appeal to her more since her taste buds are messed up right now. Also, encourage her to eat whatever sounds good, even if it's not healthiest food. If she thinks she could eat ice cream, serve her up a bowl :) Once she gets some food back in her regularly she'll start feeling more like eating and can ditch the less healthy stuff.
