The  extolled 5 days is really 9 (better than 7 weeks of radiation once a day for 5 days a week, but ...) with  a 2 day period to have it set in and be evaluated and,  of course, a weekend in the course of the 5 days. Meanwhile, there is a spear in you and you are told that any pain is just \"pressure.\" I am pretty pain tolerant, but also have small breasts, which seems to be a factor, and the repositioning has been excruciating. Counting down the hours. The radiation is easy and painless. The positioning and re-positioning, from day to day, as it moves ... (and getting my breast pushed on to get rid of excess fluid) has been dreadful. I expect that I would do it again -- to just get it over with and also spare my heart on lungs on the left side, but - be forewarned! The SaviSisters stories are not the only ones!",
