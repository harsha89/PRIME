I'm obese and swimming is my way of exercising. I even have water aerobic \"weights\" I use for my arms.",

Those protein drinks like Boost have a lot of calories. I also think you need to get that looked at. I just doesn't sound at all right. Could it be that you are taking the other meds at the same time?",

The skin under my arm broke today so they were talking about taking a break. I really don't want to because I have two daughters I home-school and I need this to be over. So they are going to ask if we can do the boosters to get away from my underarm and then go back to the whole breast and finish that way. That might be good to have a week break from the armpit being radiated since that is the most painful for me. Today was number 20 of 34. The last 8 are boosters because my chest is so large.",

I'm fortunate that right across my neighborhood there is a medical building owned by Baycare and I can do radiation there. In theory I could walk there but I doubt I will because we live in FL and are going into the 100 degree days soon. What questions should I ask on the 2nd? I had clear margins on a 6 millimeter lump and the one node they removed was clear. I was told to expect around 6 weeks of radiation after my breasts heal up which would be 4 weeks from the lumpectomy date, right? They are healing well, just the site where they took the node feels lumpy. It is my left breast and I'm a little worried about heart damage. Did anyone see their cardiologist before starting treatment?",

I home school my kids year round and want an idea how much to plan for them to do on their own while I'm gong (they do 5th grade work). I'm also wondering...I have several skin tags on my left side where I will receive radiation. Should I see about having them removed before I start? There are a few right under my breast that and a couple in the underarm region. I meant to take care of them in June before I received the diagnosis. Now I'm not sure if I should get them removed or leave them and handle it later.",
