      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 02:09AM - edited Dec 30, 2011 02:12AM by Mandalala I wanted a bilateral mastectomy, but the surgeon recommended a lumpectomy and I said OK. Why I wanted the mastectomy: I didn't want radiation, I didn't want to worry about recurrence, I wanted the two sides to be even in order to avoid problems with my back. I told the surgeon to not think of what she thought I would feel, or how she thought I wanted to look, because I was interested in safety only. Nevertheless, she recommended the lumpectomy. She said that lumpectomy plus radiation would be as safe as a mastectomy, and there would be less problems after surgery with a lumpectomy. It was the \"less problems after surgery\" part that made me say OK, because I just want to function. I don't care a lot for having breasts. They are heavy, I can't lie on my chest reading or sleeping, I am through with breast-feeding long ago and I don't have a partner. Maybe I would miss them anyway, but I doubt it. But I had a grade 1 cancer, and felt kind of silly arguing for a major surgery which wasn't really needed. But now, after radiation and having read more about the long-term effects, I wish I had insisted on mastectomy.",

If I am going to be tired and feel poorly for weeks, we'll have to plan. People tell me I should care only about my own health, but I really care about my work anyway. So, is there any way to estimate beforehand when the tiredness will kick in, and is there anything to do about it? (No chemo, right now no Tamoxifen, no other health problems.) ",

Since the operation it's been smaller, but now it's bigger. I know it can get swollen from radiation, but the nurses told me that this usually happens later. So is it a bad sign? Will it be worse later because it started already? ",

I am done now, they skipped the last 5 boosts as the radiation burns were too bad. They are still bad (I have to wash them with salt solution \u2013 water hurts too much \u2013 and I have to take painkillers first). But at least, I don't have to go there and make it worse any more. They told me before the treatment started that they hardly ever stop it, no matter what ... so I didn't expect them to. Glad they did anyway ... Vivirasselena, that sounds extremely awful! Hope all of it, including skin cancer, will heal and go away quickly.",

Loose clothes moving against the nipple isn't very nice either. But if I wear a silk scarf under my bra it's OK! Of course, the silk scarf is ruined by the liters of creams I apply every day, but it works. I think silk is the only material soft enough.",
