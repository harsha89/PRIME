I did some research and said 'hey you know what it's normal right?' Well now I'm 16 and that same boob looks pinched and/or like it was suctioned. It also has this lump that I don't feel when I'm examining my other boob (which looks normal and healthy). I keep thinking 'maybe it's nothing', 'maybe it's normal', and 'I'm too young'. I don't know I if i should be concerned and talk to a doctor.. this has been on my mind for a while now.. Log in to post a reply",
