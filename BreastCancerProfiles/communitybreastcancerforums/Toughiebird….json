I am 59 years old tested positive to chek 2 about 6 months ago (family history has older sister had DCIS 9 years ago, and paternal aunt had breast cancer in the 1970s). I was told chek2 roughly increases risk of developing bc in a lifetime 2x ( so 1 in 4 roughly vs 1 in 8 of general population)I was just diagnosed ( from standard ULTRASOUND pick up) with suspicious tiny area, turned out to be DCIS - but high grade aggressive cells and ER/PR- scary but lucky because MRI and 3d mammogram did NOT pick up spot, I had a surgical biospy/lumpectomy in mid may removing area with tiny DCIS, clear margins, all out - healing now. Challenge is Ive learned 2 types of chek2 ( most research is on the 111delc and another S428F (mine). Mine is a little less aggressive but less research and updated all the time). i had full genetics counseling, which i recommend if there is time - said chek2 was important but interacted with my characteristics and must look at family history in all this too - NOT just chek2 in isolation. Yes, uptick for colon cancer but depends on type and recommended colonoscopy every 5 years. i received conflicting information how much influencing colon on my type - so better safe than sorry. After DCIS in my left beast and all my consults this last month, it seems if i have radiation following left breast lumpectomy, i have about a 5-10% of reoccurrance over 10 years and another 10% risk of a NEW PRIMARY developing in that left or the clear right breast over 10 years. Math says about 20% over 20 years. But no one will definitive recommendation that radiation and meds -( debatable how effective on meds since i was RE/PR - for this one incidence)course or prophylatic bmx is on the table too - but i told all about my threshold for risk. Last genetics Dr at major hospital here, said my 5% from all this together were not thigh enough to recommend bmx but it certainly is my choice. What scares me is if it can return (even with these slightly lower % - it can return as invasive - not DCIS like this time )( ie vs brca for ex where its higher %). my numbers are NOT definite so please read with that in mind. Ive seen so many dr. Chek2 is scary but the analysis really helps put it in context of risk. I was told in my case the chek2 not a major factor for ovarian concerns, beyond normal risk. hope my experiences (as i am living and meeting the stress right now) helps.",

Getting it out of my head and onto this is a great relief and gives me such hope and inspiration. i see the plastic surgeon this upcoming week on the reconstruction and then set a date this week. I am personally always better with a definite plan and I have been blessed that I do have 3 other siblings helping with my mom and I have a slightly feisty and assertive personality at times - so i never fear asking for what i need or challenging the medical profession for answers if I'm confused. The waiting period of test, results and diagnoses has been hell for me.With the check2, the medical profession just does not know as much about it - because the research and risk are so new - and there are 2 versions with different degrees of risk - so i had to dive in and do all my research these past 6 weeks on my own. A good lesson and I learned a lot and will have to keep learning, Terrified to have a colonoscopy and endoscopy just last week because my anxiety was so high - to know that was all clear - before my breast surgery and recent diagnosis of my Mom - but did it and grateful all ok down there! . TY to all of you so much. i welcome any experience, advice, thoughts and knowlege as i proceed along.",
