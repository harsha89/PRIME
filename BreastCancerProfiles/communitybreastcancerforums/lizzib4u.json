I had notice some unusal symptoms that were similar to Paget's disease. The oncologist did not think it was, but he ordered a Mamogram, MRI and blood test. They all were negative. He was going to send me home and tell me to come back for annual mamogram, but he knew I was upset that I still thought it was something. He decided it would be better to prove me wrong and get a second opinion, so I was sent the surgeon. She also didn't think I had anything. She asked if it would make me feel better, she could do a biopsy. Well, she did. Two weeks later I was told I had Paget's disease and had to have nipple removal. When they removed the nipple in December, they found that my original cancer had been discovered when they tested the margins. I have just spent the last year recovering from having a trans flap procedure. If I had not gone for a second opinion, It woud have had a worse out come. I also should mention that this was a reccurance of breast cancer diagnoised in 2003, that was treated with  lumpectomy followed by chemo, radiation and hormone treatment. It does come back.",
