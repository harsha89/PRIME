      "Content": "CK24 wrote: Hi, 48 yo female here. Noticed a black spot on my left nipple 3 1/2 weeks ago. Showed husband when he got home two days later and he said it was new to him, too. He noticed a shiny spot on top of the black spot. I googled black spot on nipple and saw down below that nipple discharge can be one of the symptoms of breast cancer . . . Saw my nurse practitioner early the next week. She squeezed out some clear fluid and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram/ultrasound the next week, which said: IMPRESSION: Suspicious segmental area of calcifications and nodularities. RECOMMENDATION: Stereotactic biopsy of 2 sites of microcalcifications, bothanterior and posterior within the area of abnormality. There is a two week wait time for biopsies, so I will not be able to get in until this next week. Expecting bad news . . . I have had occasional shooting pains from the area they found suspicious for several years. Since the mammogram, I have had pain (and occasional hot feeling) in various parts of both breasts. Everything I read scares me. The last 3 weeks have been emotionally exhausting. So many tears, so much desperation, a complete upheaval of my life and lifestyle. I just finished a 12 day water fast on Wed., refeeding yesterday on watermelon and green vegetables (I heard a water fast can kick start the immune system and clean out bodily waste). Same plan for today, then adding in some sweet potatoes tomorrow. Need to rebuild my strength to be able to get that biopsy done next week. Got my period a few days ago, the first time since early Feb. I thought I had started menopause. The hot feeling seemed to go away when I got my period. Trying to stay calm, trying to come to terms with the possibilities, mourning life as I knew it . . . wondering what in the world is ahead for me. Log in to post a reply",

Your gentleness and compassion warm my heart, and are truly appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è My biopsies are scheduled for Wednesday, the 16th. I have never had one before. Thank you for your supportive words about my fast. It was only 12 days, and originally I was just too sad and scared to eat. But I had read that fasting could be helpful in cleaning out diseased cells and jumpstarting the immune system, and so just went with it. I hope it was helpful. I am indeed weak right now, three days after ending the fast. I am adding new foods every day, and eating more, but it will take a few more days to feel stronger, I guess. I am following the diet TrueNorth Health Center recommends: no salt, oil, nor sugar, no animal foods, and no gluten. Foods are raw or steamed whole plant foods, though my husband did peel my sweet potato last night (I felt kind of guilty about that, since I had read it is important to eat the skin with all the vitamins right below it). Yes, I have control issues :). I feel like I must do everything I can to give my body the best chance to fight back. It is hard to forgive myself for not eating a stricter diet over the years. I have known for 20 years about dairy and oil, but I ate them, anyway. And I have no doubt that many women can eat them, no problem. But I don't think my body can. And I am paying a big price for that. My loved ones do keep telling me not to blame myself, which is comforting. I am grateful for their compassion, and forgiveness. It is hard not to feel like I have let them down, though. I knew better, but I did not do better. And the punishment is heavy. To try to keep some sense of sanity, I am meeting with a reiki practitioner and meeting with a spiritual something, not sure what to call her. She puts a lot of emphasis on positivity. She also knew right away where I was feeling the pain in my breast, as she said she felt it in hers at that moment. That convinced me about her. I have to work on my positivity! This post sounds so depressing! Not sure how long posts are allowed to be here, so will start a new one. Thanks again so much for your response.",

It really is comforting to have our pain acknowledged. ü•Ä Thank you, couragement, for the kind words about my son. I was so lost during his challenges. And I had so little hope. The odds just seemed so against us. And I had three boys younger than him, so it was not like I could just focus on him. And it was probably better that way. And my husband was in a different city, trying to keep a business going when it looked like it might shutter. We had many different priorities to juggle. But six years on from our son's relapse, our son is still with us.‚ù§Ô∏è My daughter offered for the younger boys and me to move in with her. She will be on the East Coast starting in Sept, right now finishing up a year for her company in Asia. She is such a comfort to me, such a calm, intelligent young woman, with such a bright future. She has been on one of the pharma teams working with a new drug, and is very excited about the possibilities for treatment in the future. She was the first bone marrow donor for our son, and the work her company does on these drugs is personal to her. It is not just a job. She knows these drugs can save people's lives. I wish I could just be selfless and not care about my own life. But I want to live, too!",

I have focused a lot on death and making peace with death, but everyone wants me to back up from that, to take it one day at a time. And to first get a diagnosis. Everything I read from the medical side is so discouraging, though. And all the alternative therapies seem so complicated. I want to do the right thing, but feel confused and overwhelmed. I am praying to God to help me. I ask people to pray with me, too. I am trying to become a better person.
