In June I started having severe pain in my right breast.  After some weeks I finally saw my Gyn, who sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound.  My diagnosis:  complex sclerosing lesion, fibroadenomatoid hyperplasia, and usual intraductal hyperplasia.  I now have an appointment to see a breast surgeon.  Even though I looked everything up, should I still be worried?
