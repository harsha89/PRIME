I have to go in for my results on monday, i don't know how i'm going to cope.  I don't want my mum to come with me, this is all way above her head.  None of my friends have offered.....i'm thinking whatever just go in alone.....how did anyone else cope with this? Also, I'm now quite aware of the 'lump' since the biopsy.  There is still discomfort, there wasn't before.  Does this mean that i'm just feeling the injury of the biopsy or does it mean there really is a disease there?  Obviously at this stage i don't know the results and i'm guessing....hoping the discomfort is due to the biopsy injury",
