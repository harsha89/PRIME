I have been trying not to think about it to much I figure worrying about it isn't going to change the outcome. I think I'm overly sensitive about cancer simply because of the various cancers that my family has had and losing my father to cancer at a very young age. But I know the odds are in my favor and I need to just remain positive. I will just be glad when the whole testing process is over and I have a definitive answer. Until then I will just continue with my life the same as always. With my boys. ",

Hopefully I will hear something by Friday and won't have to wait over the weekend. Trying not to worry about it to much. I know the odds are still good at it being benign. ",
