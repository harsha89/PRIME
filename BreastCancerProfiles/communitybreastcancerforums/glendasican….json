I have a lump in my left breast which i discovered only 2 months ago. I went to the Doctor and she said there is nothing to worry because it was just a breast mouse because it is moving. But then she told me to undergo a mammogram. The result was that the lump was worrisome so I had to undergo a breast ultrasound. The result was still the same. The lump is worrisome because it has an irregular shape. I am so scared now because I am 39 and have 3 young kids if ever I have cancer. I will undergo biopsy this week and I am so scared of the result. Now, I am so depressed thinking of the result. But I am really praying and hoping that it would be benign or if not the disease is diagnosed early and could still be treated.",
