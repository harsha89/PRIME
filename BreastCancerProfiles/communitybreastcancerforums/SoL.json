Ok, so, I had 4 rounds of Paclitaxel, once a week. It's been all good, side effects expected and manageable, we'll say. I'm suppose to have my 5th round tomorrow, Wednesday. Blood work yesterday, first I see my WBC lowering in \"the red\", my RBC is always a bit too low, and my platelets followed of course but are still in the \"orange\" i'd say. So with numbers, it goes : WBC 3.4 - RBC 10.4 - Platelets, 128. I contacted my oncologist already but she hasn't answered yet, when are WBC too Low for chemo ? I know they have solution, just need to adjust family plans for it if they decide to push my 5th round, or will I still need to be there for the appointment so they can give me whatever they give to make the WBC normally react ? Anyone knows ?  Thank you !",
