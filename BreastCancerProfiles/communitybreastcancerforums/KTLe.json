Don't ever apologize aaoaao-My friend told me before I had to shave my head that she could totally see me rocking a bald head, and I was surprised to find how much I'm liking it. I even had T-shirts made that read,\"Today is a No Hair Day.\" I try to stay as upbeat as I can:) Had my 3rd chemo Tuesday. Went fine. I'm having my dreaded Neulasta shot Thursday. I suffered so much pain after my second chemo tx/Neulasta shot that they tweaked my steroids and suggested having the Neulasta shot 48 hours later. I'm going to try it in my belly this time, because I've been getting it in my arm.  I sure hope it makes a difference. I'd never felt such pain in my life.  We're all going to get through this, somehow, and one day we won't need to post on here anymore, but I'm so glad you're all here to share with now Thanks",

I thought losing my hair would be the most traumatizing, but I actually embraced it. It was hot during the summer, but not for my head What's funny though is when it's windy, I'll turn my head so my hair doesn't get in my face and then I remember...I don't have any hair! On a more yucky note, I have been having diarrhea, which I didn't have during chemo. Anyone else experience this? My life has been reduced to looking forward to a solid poop. Nocompromises, thanks for letting us know that things will still be happening with our bodies for a while. I just felt so incredibly relieved when chemo was over that I think I forgot that I would still experience side effects. Hannariggs- how are you feeling? You really will make it through, my dear. We are having to be so much stronger than we ever thought we were, but we're doing it. Good luck everybody!! Stay strong",

I got so focused on always having wanted a reduction, that instead of a bilat mastecomy, I had my left mastectomy and right breast reduction. I don't regret not removing my right breast or having the reduction, but the surgeon didn't do as good a job on my breast as he has on so many other pts. That's always a risk with surgery. Just remember that there is no rush. It's crazy, but I like how light I feel without my left breast. Good luck with your difficult decision Soriya-We are all here for you. You will be fine :)",

My therapist, Liz, had me see her twice a week for one month. She would have me do different exercises and massage my mastectomy side to get rid of any knots. It made me feel like I was taking an active role in my healing so it helped psychologically as well:) If your insurance covers it, I really think it's helpful.

Like some of you, I didn't think I would make it through all chemo tx's. I was ready to quit after #3, but somehow, I made it this far. This will be my 6th tx and I've never heard anyone ring a bell, so I'm thinking my infusion center doesn't do anything for your last tx. I was thinking of shouting out,\"My last chemo, baby!\", but then I thought pts who have more tx's might not appreciate that. I have had a cold for two weeks now and was wondering what I would I do if my onc said I couldn't have my final tx due to that and was relieved to hear that a few of you had the same experience. I'm assuming when you told your doc you were doing it, they didn't argue:) I am on the fence about radiation. I'm so sick of tx's that I don't want to go for 25 more. My rad onc put the ball in my court,because I'm a Stage II and had the lymph node dissection. Also, have any of you who are/going to be on Tamoxifen considered not taking it? Stay strong, ladies!

I am a mammographer whose IDC was found on my screening mammogram, April 9th of this year. The cancer was less than 1cm, so that meant a \"simple\" lumpectomy and radiation. Okay, I can do that. My breast surgeon asked for an MRI, which showed 3 more areas of the same IDC. After my mastectomy, a total of 6 areas of cancer were found. Two cancers that didn't show up on any imaging studies. I was large breasted and was, of course, curious as to how I would feel when I saw no breast where my left one used to be. It's been three months since my surgery and I really enjoy how light I feel. I'm not happy this happened, but I'm determined to find the upsides.  Mellie289, my first chemo and Neulasta shot were no problem at all. I, of course, hoped I'd always be so lucky, but being that the effects of chemo are cumulative, I knew things could be different. Had my second chemo on July 30th. What a difference! After my Neulasta shot, I experienced pain in all my joints and my neck like I've never experienced before. I was crying like a baby and I usually have a high pain tolerance. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was given 4 different meds for nausea, but nothing for pain. I called the cancer center an NO ONE answered! Their phone lines were down and I didn't know what to do. I called everyone I could think of that would have some info and finally, my supervisor, who used to be a chemo nurse told me Ibuprofen would be okay. With all the meds and chemo on board, I didn't want to make any mistakes and take the wrong thing. When I finally spoke to my MO's nurse, she said she and my MO were going to reduce my pre-chemo meds and do my Neulasta shot two days later instead of the next day. We'll see how that goes. Mellie, I wanted to know what you did about your hair. I did what they recommended and cut my medium length hair shorter so, in theory, it wouldn't be as traumatic when it started to come out. When it started coming in strands, I was okay with it, but when it changed to clumps, I had my hair stylist shave it. First she cut it so it was about one inch in length. When she put the razor to my head, I got really teary-eyed and then she started shaving. There was another client and her hair stylist next to me and, once I was bald, they said I looked beautiful and what a nice shaped head I had. It was what I needed to hear. Here's my surprise: I love my bald head! It's so nice and cool and cuts 15mins. off my time when getting ready in the morning. The downside: after this second chemo, my head has erupted with painful, itchy, ugly red acne. I want to take the steel brush you use to clean your bbq and scrape my scalp off, it itches so severely. Another breast ca pt had this happen and she recommends using Hibiclens and salicylic acid which is in many acne meds. I'm trying that now. I'll let you know if it works.  Mellie, did you end up getting a port? I got a port, because I didn't want to get poked for everything. I hope whatever you chose works out for you I'm glad we have this July chemo group, because I really need to hear from and share with others who are in this club we never wanted to join. This truly will be something we will look back on one day, but often, it feels like that's a long way away. I have a crazy question. Since this has happened, I have gotten rid of so much material stuff. Has anyone else done that? It makes me feel lighter and I'm sure the biggest reason is it's something that I have control over. What do the rest of you do to not live tx to tx? It's hard not to sometimes. My heart is with each and every one of you and I'm so grateful we have this forum for sharing.",

Neulasta kicked my butt last time, so we tweaked some things hoping it wouldn't be so bad. I got the pain controlled, but then the pain meds nauseated me, so I had to take anti-nausea meds PLUS I'm taking anti-bx for this severe folliculitis break out over my entire scalp, so I don't think my stomach is too happy with me  Lana-Why does your husband want you to wear a headcover? I was wearing one because I thought my bald head made others uncomfortable when I realized that I didn't do anything to feel uncomfortable about! This happened to US. We didn't do anything to be ashamed or embarrassed of. I've been rocking my bald head too, and I really like it:) Do you ever have those moments when you go to brush your hair out of your face, then remember that you have no hair? I've done that twice. 2bluestars-Don't freak out about the drains. When I took a shower, I took a shoelace and made a necklace out of the drains so that I wouldn't have to worry about accidentally yanking them. I continued to wear the drains on another shoelace around my waist. It just seemed easier. Emptying your drains will become just another task that you've had to get used to in this club that none of us signed up for. They'll show you how to empty them. It's really easy and just remember to wash your hands afterward. I had 2 surgeries. After my mastectomy, I had one drain and when my BS pulled it out, I felt nothing. After my lymph node dissection, I had two drains. When she pulled those out at the same time, it was NOT delightful, but the pain subsided within seconds. Removing the drains takes seconds, so try to remember that it'll be over soon. It'll be over soon. And take a deep breath. Also, I believe they give you a thoracic nerve block when you have a mastectomy, which is why I never had any pain from that surgery.  Curious, do any of you wear a face mask when you're at work or in public during your nadir days? I'm going to see Michael McDonald in concert next Friday and I'll be at my nadir, so I'll probably wear a mask. As if my bald head and uniboob don't already scream my situation, I'll add a nice yellow face mask to the mix:) I'm tired and nauseated. Gonna try to sleep.

I had left mast and right reduction, because I'd wanted a reduction for a long time. A part of me can't help but wonder if I should've taken them both off. Now that my breast is reduced, my mammogram is going to look entirely different, so a new cancer would probably be hard to see. I don't regret my choice at all. Just second guessing, a little. Ask yourself how you would feel with and without the bilat mast. I hope you find your answer. So many things we never thought we'd have to figure out, but hey, we're here",

Cancer Society has free ones, so you can always have one on hand if you feel like having a hair day :) I found a saying that I love, \"The only way out is through.\" My friend told me,\"When you're going through hell...keep going.\" That's a good one too. Good luck, Honeybunny!",

I thought I wouldn't be able to look in the mirror, but I really love how light I feel. Are you doing reconstruction? Don't let anyone make you believe that you HAVE to do reconstruction. I think we are at a very vulnerable stage when we're asked if we want recon. Everyone's different, but walk around for a while and see how you feel. I'm going to get a mastectomy bra. I didn't think I would, because I'm trying to be as comfortable in this new body as I can. I keep reminding myself that I didn't do anything wrong, so I have nothing to be embarrassed about. Another thing I want to pass on to everyone, if you're unsure if you want/need a mastectomy bra, it's usually an option. What I mean is, you don't necessarily HAVE to have one. A saleswoman at the specialty store I went to said, \"Oh yes, you HAVE to have a mastectomy bra.\" She said I would get shoulder drop and spinal issues. My surgeon said shoulder drop is nerve related and that the bra was optional. Try to take a friend with you when you go shopping for these things. Is there anybody out there who doesn't live from treatment to treatment. I try not to, but it sure is challenging. Stay strong ladies:) We are going to make it through!",

My throat was sore, but my cough was non-productive, so it really didn't affect my chemo tx. I was the last one in the infusion suite with two nurses, so when I was finished and cheered,\" My last chemo, baby!\" The next day my attitude was a thousand times better. I'm not sure how I made it through the last three tx's, but I did, which means the rest of you strong women will get through it, as well. We all have a strength in us that wasn't tested before and it's coming through for us now. We're all going to make it!",

After suffering through chemo, I felt like radiation was a piece of cake. My skin is very fair, and surprisingly, I haven't had any blistering. The wide area of peeling is so gross, but as I keep saying during this journey,\"It is what it is.\" My hair is growing back on my head and the hair on my legs is like a forest, but I don't want to cut it because IT'S HAIR!! It's hair that I now have control of It's been over two months since my last chemo and I am having water faucet diarrhea. I have to take Imodium every few days. Could this actually be another side effect of chemo, even though it's been a few months? Have any or your docs said how long these effects will continue? Thanks for your input. I'm sorry for you ladies who have the opportunity for sex, but can't enjoy it right now. It's been years for me, so I can't even imagine, but with time, I'm hoping it will be a pleasure again. Life will be good again ladies. 2014 is a fresh beginning for all of us!",
