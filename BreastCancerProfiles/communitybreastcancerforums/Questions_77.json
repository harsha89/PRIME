My mom nearly passed away in December 2007 but God is good and she made it out of the hospital on Boxing Day that year. After that she pretty much began to improve for the entire year--putting on weight and shunning her wheelchair for a cane (two of her vertebrae are fused from the mets causing them to break).  In December 2008 her headaches (a hydrocephalus due to mets near her speech and balance center) came back but she did not say anything! Then for January, February and March she was fine (I found out later). Her oldest son and her only two granchildren visited her and she was very happy (In March). Then we moved and she started sleeping a lot again. I thought she had come down off the high of seeing her grandkids, only to find out that the headaches were back! We barely made it to the hospital to get a CT scan which had her admitted the same night (this was last Tuesday) with bleeding in her head. She stayed in the hospital till Saturday gone. Now she is back out. Her speech had been very slurred during that time but it is better now (God and dexamethosone). her balance is still off. The good news: She saw her doctor today and finally agreed to take radiation treatment for her brain mets! Then the doctor is thinking of putting her on Vinoralbine (intravenous) later. Any advice to help me help her? Any tips about radiation? Vinoralbine?  I am especially concerned about the fatigue part. How can I help her muster whatever energy she has left? Also I cannot find out how the dosing goes. Does she get like one dose of Vinoralbine every month? What are the worst days of chemo? The best days? How do I smooth it out for her? (She is coming off Xeloda which only darkened her hands and feet--nothing else. This will be her first brush with side-effects and I am worried.)  You do not know how you guys lifted me up back when she was stubborn about getting treatment and the rest of the family was acting in clueless ways!  Log in to post a reply",
