    "Content": "graygirlie wrote: I had a lumpectomy at the beginning of March to remove tumor at 12 o'clock position as well as one under my arm, same side. Told both were benign. After surgery I had noticeable divet where tumor had been however within two weeks it had filled in. The scar under my arm is very hard underneath stretching into my breast. I assume this is scar tissue. It is rock hard and lumpy. My main concern is that the majority of my breast now feels very firm and lumpy. Small, tiny gravely lumps. Not in the area where the tumor was but the whole thing, mainly around the nipple. I have small breasts and have had three kids so having a firm boob feels strange. It feels heavy. Just wondering if anyone else has had this same issue? I am just paranoid something was missed as this seems strange. Can't see bs until 27th. Log in to post a reply",
