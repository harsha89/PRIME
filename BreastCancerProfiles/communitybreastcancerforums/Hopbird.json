Good luck to you on Wednesday.  It will be better once you know what to expect.  I had a nurse today that gave me my first infusion five weeks ago.  I said something to her about how she might not remember but she was the first one.  Then she looked at me and DID remember, told me what chair I was sitting in.  She told me how much better I looked today than that day.  My problem that day?  Complete terror.  I was sitting and waiting for the drugs and could barely keep the tears from running down my face.  She said now I look as if I'm handling it fine.......which I guess I am, but I'd still rather be doing anything with my days. Again, good luck! Diagnosis: 8/13/2009, IDC, ER-/PR-, HER2+",

I took mine at Georgia Cancer Specialists, even though I'm not having treatment there.  The girl that came (her name is Jamie) works in a salon in downtown Alpharetta called Borellis (right at Old Milton) and she has a little room with all of her products for cancer patients.  She's very helpful and will order wigs and all, but I already had a wig and went in there to get a few hair coverings.  She will close the door and work with you to try different options and doesn't make you feel pressured...she just wants you to see choices.  I'd just call and make sure she will be there and then go in.  She was great! Brenda, I hate that your port access hurt so much.  Part of that may have been the newness of the port and the soreness of the area.  I've had mine accessed 7 times now, and I've found that some are absolutely painless and some hurt a little, and I can't tell why it is different.  That cream sounds like a good option.  Of course, you can always use my favorite trick any time a needle comes at me.  I don't look!  I tell them if I don't look I can pretend it isn't happening!  OH, and besides our diagnosis dates we have another thing in common.  I have three sons as well.  The oldest left for college right before I turned the phone on and had a message from my oncologist.....then I cried twice as hard.",

CCNani, I just want to comment on your Her2+ status.  While at one point, Her2+ cancer was not a good thing, that has been offset by the success of Herceptin.  I encourage you to go read the Her2+ thread.  It means we have to take the stinking drug for a year, but it has been very exciting in the field and has made being Her2+ NOT not necessarily a bad thing any more!   I know you may read things that say so, but realize that Herceptin has only been used for early stage cancer for a very short time, and they stopped some trials that would have given some good data early because they felt it wasn't right to deprive some participants of it.  BTW, my doctor also wanted to shy away from AC because of the cardiac issue in combination with the Herceptin.  One or the other, but not both! Coolbreeze, I also know how you feel about the one year thing........yep, me too!  Although I think after my chemo is over and I'm down to just Herceptin every few weeks it will feel like a picnic.  My youngest just turned 13 a week ago.  Oddly, he handles this whole thing better than anyone.  Kids don't have the same perception of \"cancer\" that we grew up with.  Just let him know you'll have days you don't feel well, but there will be others when you feel just fine, and take advantage of those for him.  Good luck to all of those that are starting soon!",

Glad you got in the class.  I thought it was helpful, and the freebies were good.  I'm not doing TCH, although it was my other option and I thought hard about it.  Emory is trying a new Protocol that I'm doing.  They didn't really recommend it over the TCH other than that the version of Taxol I'm taking might be (and they said MIGHT) a little easier to tolerate than some other protocols.  The TCH we talked about was every three weeks for 18 weeks also with weekly Herceptin, then Herceptin every three weeks...same as you are doing.  The Herceptin alone doesn't bother me at all, other than a little stomach stuff that night....just a few belches and maybe a quick trip to the bathroom.  By the next day I'm up and running, and that whole week life is good.",

Also, whoever asked about bone pain from Neulasta.....I had only a little, mostly in the evening, for some reason.  It started the evening AFTER the shot was given, went away the next morning, was back the next evening, that was about it. ",

Your pharmacy situation is better than mine.......it's $100 at the pharmacy for me.  We still thought about doing it rather than driving into town, but since I have three more....dunno.  Thanks to diagnostic procedures I've maxxed my out of pocket for the year on my medical so I won't pay anything there.....  Right now I'm looking at having a local hospital (affiliated on paper with the one that I'm seeing in town) administer the shot.  Then I get the best of both worlds.  I don't know that it will happen, though.  Red tape being what it is.......... And I'm not doing the A/C - T.  My doctor didn't even like that option because of the possibility of heart toxicity.  I have borderline BP and all, increases my risk with the Herceptin.  My regimen is part of a study..drugs that have worked well against advanced disease with Herceptin, they're looking at using them more for early disease.  They'll scan me again at 8 weeks and see if it seems to be having an effect.  If not, we will have to decide whether to continue or swtich to TCH.   Why did I go this route?  They've had good results with patients so far, and the combination is supposed to be a bit less toxic and easier to tolerate.  I'm fine with that, so long as they can make sure it is doing its job.  My first round was relatively easy to tolerate.  Second round next Monday......we'll see. I should maybe explain that my first diagnosis was May 2008.  I had surgery (mastectomy, tram reconstruction) but no chemo at the time.  All doctors and I thought that was the best decision based upon the fact that I had almost all DCIS, one microinvasion.  Then, in August I found out that I had beat the odds (lucky me :( ) and although I had been node negative at the time of my surgery I now have a node that has cancer in it.  That's why we're doing chemo.  They did a scan to be sure I had no mets, and that came back fine.  When they re-scan they want to see the node smaller and less active. ",

Good luck again tomorrow! ",

Jayne, I had similar complications after my surgery...although I never needed hospitalized.  It's so wonderful how people will step up for us, isn't it?  I wasn't on chemo when mine happened, but it started several weeks (6 to 8) after surgery.  I kept having fluid, though, that my PS drained with a syringe.  Finally they scheduled me to have a drain put back in, but then by the time they got me in it had gone down and they couldn't find a big enough area to install the drain.  I was on antibiotics for a month....it was not fun, but I got through it.  Hang in there! Anita, glad you handled your Taxol OK.  My worst SE (and I never felt this one) was that my liver enzymes climbed.  They sonogrammed my liver and it was fine.  Now that I've gotten off of the Abraxane they have lowered...not to normal yet, but they're heading the right way!",

I missed the new posts, but am kinda blue after my round 3 yesterday.  I go to a well known facility that ends up with a lot of people who are referred after regular stuff doesn't work...but yesterday I started feeling like that was everyone.  I told my husband, I really need to have chemo one day sitting next to someone who is going through it for the first time and who expects to be finished afterward, as I do.  I admire these Stage 4 people and see so much hope as I see how even having being diagnosed years ago they walk in and out of the place looking to be in as good a shape as me...maybe better, because they've moved on to non-hair loss drugs.  But I'm not ready to think about being in their shoes one day.  For right now I want to think this will work and I will be able to close the book on this and look back at it one day.",

It was explained to me that just because you've had BC doesn't mean your risk of getting it in the other breast is that much higher.  I decided to hang on to what I had, and I guess time will tell if that is the right decision.  Now if I thought I had developed a SECOND cancer I think I'd be feeling like I wanted to remove about anything I could that could possibly develop into cancer. And MrsB you're exactly right.  I think I had to come to terms shortly after diagnosis with the fact that I don't have any control or choice about how this all works out.  Once you accept that, you do all you can and live with what comes next.  I much prefer being in control.",

My stage IV diagnosis came in the way of brain surgery, so there was no secret.  I haven't dwelt on what is to come because right now I'm fine.  The people around me know it has spread...I can't worry about what they think that means.  I don't really know what any of it means, I am going to keep my thoughts on the fact that I'll figure it out later...although I have started doing the things that are important...no sense putting it off!  :)  I figure it will sink in over time, and everyone knows what the possibilities are.  And one thing that has helped me was the realization that whether kids are 4 or 40, most don't want anything bad to happen to mom, but eventually it does.  Its never going to be easy for them.",

And I don't know the age of your kids, but I have found that mine have shown some real ability to cope and adapt to my situation.  While I'm sad that they have to, I think they feel good about themselves and their ability to help out.  We moms tend to put too much pressure on ourselves to be there for them, and I do believe it is good for their little souls to be able to be there for us.  Hang in there! ",
