I know what you are going through since my core biopsy was initially benign.....but they wanted to remove it since it was still a \"concerning\" lump.  I would have to agree with what Deanna said above about finding out if they can schedule the appts together for you since you have a long drive AND especially her comment about bringing someone with you!  When I received my results from the core biopsy, I heard the benign but \"concerning\" and then promptly forgot everything from that point on!  It is really hard to concentrate on what they are saying (even though they know that and take their time and ask if you have any questions....etc) BUT having someone else there will help you remember afterwards what they said.  It may also help if you go over what your questions are with the person going with you so they are sure to ask those for you if you forget to ask them! I am hoping to have my husband take care of asking/remembering answers tomorrow when we get the results.  Better yet, I hope that there is no need since it will be benign!  However, I know my mind may still shut down even then and I won't hear what the heck the bugger was that was in me and I may not ever know!!!  I'll have to make sure to ask for a copy of the pathology report!!! Take care and keep in touch!  We started this trek at the same time ~ hopefully it will end at the same time and place.....benign! ",

I do also have \"fibrocystic breast disease\" and what that is going to mean for my diagnostic future I am not sure.  I do have to go back in 6 weeks for another u/s to \"make sure all is well\" ~ not quite sure what he meant by that.....will have to clarify what he meant when I see him.  I have asked if it will grow back and he said \"it shouldn't\".  I have an \"itchy breast\" but no discharge at all.  So, we wait again to see where we go from here, BUT I and my family are truly breathing a sigh of relief for the first time since December! I hope that you can feel that this is really good news and not let it worry you too much.  Does it mean that you will never get cancer......no one can say that, but for this moment you are okay!  Take care! Kelly",

I also found the same info when I was researching my surgeon, who was one of the first in my area to do Sentinel node biopsies. Just my opinion (but based on much research...) Kelly ",

I had to have an excisional biopsy and had to wait AGAIN!!!!!  Don't they realize what they are doing to us??????  But, I was able to stay somewhat sane by coming on here and trying to help others and venting when needed!  I also knew that I wasn't alone....... My results did come back benign again.....a intraductal papilloma and fibrocystic breast disease. I have to have another u/s in a couple of weeks and I am not sure where we go from there.  I will always feel scared and wonder if they \"other shoe will fall\", but I know where I can go for help and support. We are here for you and please try to relax a little and know you are NOT ALONE and we are all praying and thinking of you! Kelly ",

When the core biopsy results came back, they were \"benign, but concerning\".  WHAT??????? Are they kidding?  Who is running this show, a man?  They must be trying to KILL me!  My husband just recently told me that he wanted to punch the surgeon throughout this whole thing! He was so mad at the amount of waiting we were made to do!!!!  I, however, used that time to come to terms with the reality of the situation and to mull it over in my mind.  I also tried to find support here and realized that I could do it if I had to, I just was hoping it wouldn't be the Stage IV that I feared it would be! Well, after they took the lump out, I had to wait 10 days to go back for the final results.  On that day, a strange calm came over me (I really think God works when we need him to....) and I spent the day at peace.  We did get the results that we had hoped and prayed for and it turned out to be a benign intraductal papilloma.  Now, I just have a rather large scar on my breast, an area where I am visually missing tissue, but I am cancer free and thankful! Please, when you have the ultrasound and mammogram, listen to what they say, but if they tell you that it looks as if it is cancer, remember that many women have been told this and when the biopsy results come back they are benign!  I am not sure if they do this to make sure that we come back for the biopsy (like I saw suggested on a post earlier) or if they really aren't aware of the emotional trauma they are putting us through, or ~ God forbid ~ if they just don't care!  BE SURE TO HAVE A BIOPSY IF THAT IS WHAT THEY SUGGEST!  Don't ignore that advise just because a great deal of women here have told you positive stories ~ but you don't have to automatically assume it is going to be cancer either!!!!! Take care of yourself and your family and stay connected! Kelly ",

I was a month away from my annual mammo, so I thought they might wait, but they didn't.... Roller coaster ride started immediately!! My lump hurt, didn't move and it was on the bottom... I was about 43.5. A core biopsy was done and it really looked like it was a cancerous lump... I was petrified! I opted to have it removed, and to my and the surgeon's surprise (and he is a top notch surgeon in my area... He really thought it was cancer) it was a fibroadenoma. I know you are worried, and frankly, since no one can predict the outcome, it is expected that you would be worried!! Just know that there is that chance that is just something \"small\".

The results were benign but \"concerning\"? so he wanted to take out the lump anyway!   So had a needle guided biopsy yesterday (and now I am wondering if the \"concerning\" result was because they couldn't sample part of the lump since they had a heck of a time getting the needle into the \"lesion\" ~ as they liked to call it).  Now the waiting begins again.....BUT this time my doc is going to a conference and won't be back until my follow-up appt on MARCH 12th!!!!!  So this may drive me crazy!  The only thing that is going to keep me sane is that the initial results were benign, so I am hopeful that these will be too! I have been waiting since Dec to have this resolved and it is not fun.  Now I just have to wait another 9 days and hopefully it will be over, or I will at least know where I need to begin!  It is the uncertainty that has been bothering me ~ can I spend money on this or am I going to be out of work for awhile (I do have sick time, but still....) ~ can I plan to do this or am I going to be recovering from some sort of surgery?  What does the future hold?  At least now I know that I should have some answers in the next week and a half....I've waited two months, what is 9 more days....... Take care of yourselves in the meantime..... Kelly ",

I am not sure if they missed something during the excisional, if there was one behind the papilloma, if it grew back in the six weeks since I had it removed, or if it is scar tissue (it looked like the original one, but not as big ~ I could see it as soon as I looked at the screen).  Does this mean I need MORE surgery!!!!!  Will I be having this done every six weeks or so until I have no breast left????? I see the surgeon again on Tuesday, so I should get more information (or have more questions?) then.   I am hoping that there will one day be an end to this..... Kelly ",

I am also able to get some good feedback when I see the positives when our sisters get B9 results and stop posting after awhile!  I also see the support given when the results are not good......and that is good to see as well!

Not that having a biopsy is going to be wonderful, but it shouldn't cause you pain during the procedure.  They have medication for that!  I had a core biopsy done at the end of February and they constantly asked me if I was comfortable.  I was a little freaked out about the tugging and pulling ~ but no pain.  They were willing and able to add more pain relief if I needed it.  I also had a needle guided excisional biopsy done on Monday and the insertion of the needle was again a little freaky due to the pulling and tugging.  They kept asking again (at a different hospital) if I was in pain and needed more medication.  So, unless you have truly horrible people taking care of you, their goal is your comfort ~ not causing you pain!  Let them know if you are hurting if they don't notice ~ they will help you out! Take care ~ and I will be thinking of you and hoping for benign results! Kelly ",

      "Content": "Mar 28, 2009 02:46PM - edited Mar 28, 2009 02:49PM by momo3esb Hi Saint Melissa and By Grace, I have just recently gone through all of this.....found a lump in Dec, doc felt it too.  Had to have the mammo & us done (but couldn't get in until Jan) and then off to the surgeon.  He said that I needed a core biopsy, but it was most likely going to be benign, but even if it wasn't, we caught it early and should have good results (he is not one to give false reassurances).  Core biopsy came back benign, but surgeon didn't like results (!!!!!!!) and wanted to remove lump anyway (maybe we should have skipped core in the first place?).   Good news is that the excisional biopsy came back as an intraductal papilloma (and of course fibrocystic breast disease and hyperplasia of normal type).  Now I just have to go back in 4 weeks for another us to check the area out....... My EVER CAUTIOUS surgeon won't tell me that this thing won't grow back though.  So, will I be going through this again in a few years?  Quite possibly........I am quite happy with the fact that my doctor will not tell me something just to make me happy....but I don't like the idea that this is going to hanging over my head indefinitely!  Will the next time actually be something?  Obviously no one can tell you.....but it is a scary situation.  However, I refuse to live my life in fear.  I have been ALERTED now that this can happen, not that it necessarily will.  I found the lump by accident in the shower.....now I will be more diligent about really doing self-exams!   When I went for the mammo and us in Jan, my yearly exam was scheduled for a week later.  So, I do keep up for those exams.  I am pretty diligent about my health, so I do try to keep on top of testing.  I will try to lose the extra 10-15 pounds and exercise everyday (although I really think I need a few more hours in the day!!)   I am also trying to reduce stress.  Believe it or not, this really helps!  I know what you mean about feeling silly posting here when so many women here are dealing with the worst case scenario!  But it is reassuring to many newcomers to see that not all women who find a lump or have calcifications on their mammos have cancer!  Feeling that I can help out someone that is scared is somewhat comforting to me.  So, don't worry about posting here......your problems are not trivial and you may be helping to reduce the stresses of others!!! I too am praying for ALL of our sisters, whether their results come back benign or worse!!! Thanks for \"listening\"! Kelly ",
