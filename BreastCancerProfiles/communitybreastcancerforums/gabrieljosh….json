Other disorders that may cause back pain include herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, pinched nerves, scoliosis and sciatica. There is no way to avoid shoulder pain entirely. There are ways to make it less likely, though, such as regular stretching and taking proper advantage of ergonomically-designed furniture and office equipment.",
