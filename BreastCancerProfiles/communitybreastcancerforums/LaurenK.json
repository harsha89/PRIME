The doctor placed a titanium clip in the area and I will have another ultrasound in 6 months. He recommended that I only have diagnostic mammograms from this point forward. Â ",

      "Content": "LaurenK wrote: I am 56 years old and was diagnosed with fibrocystic breasts many years ago. I have many screening and comprehensive mammograms and one needle aspiration. I had ultrasound in 2007 for new lump (fluid-filled) under my left nipple. In late 2008, I had a screening mammogram and received a called back for a lump above my left nipple. The ultrasound was inconclusive and in two weeks, I will have a biopsy to determine if the lump is solid or contains fluid. I saw the lump on the ultrasound and it is pea-shaped. There is no history on my mother side of breast cancer however, my father had prostate cancer, and his sister died of breast cancer in the 60's. I have some concerns. Any information would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
