I would call your surgeon and speak with the nurse or Dr. Are you due to go back to the office for follow up and results?. Pls keep me posted. I was diagnosed with a fibroidadenoma and surgeon said no biopsey needed even though I was diagnosed with ADH in right breast",

Will be having mastectomy of both breasts. I had lumpectomy 5 yrs ago for ADH. If I have 2 more lumpectomies the breast will end up looking deformed......pretty much nothing left inside from 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock which is why the nipple sparing mastectomy is being advised. I see plastic surgeon on 12/17/18. When I talk about it I feel like I'm talking about another person.....not talking about me. There were also Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia",
