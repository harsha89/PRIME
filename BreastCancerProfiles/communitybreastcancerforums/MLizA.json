How is that going to look with a concave chest on one side?  I am reluctanct to buy anything on-line but finding anything in stores will be very limiting.  I guess I will just have to keep looking.

He wants to do an ultrasound of my liver just in case but that has not been scheduled yet.  I am still trying to figure out if it will screw up the rest of my schedule since I have made plans around everything.
