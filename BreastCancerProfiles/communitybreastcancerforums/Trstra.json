I understand what you are going through, they just found a 1cm mass in my left breast after diag mammo and ultrasound. My birad score is 4b \"intermediate suspicion for malignancy\"! I have to wait until next Fri 1/9 to consult with surgeon and get a biopsy scheduled. I'm trying to remain positive since I know several people who have had biopsies that were benign. However it is SO hard not to obsess and worry about it! Pls let us know how it all turns out! Sending you happy thoughts!",
