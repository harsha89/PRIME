The rare type of tumor I had (low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma)can also come from intraductal papilomas, so it's best to get them out. I didn't have any calcifications, so I don;t know how that affects anything for you. I wouldn't worry too much right now. Just have it removed, they will do the pathology, and if it's all benign, they'll just have you come back for scans every so often, probably every six months. Good luck! ",

After my BMX, I had a little issue w/ mild LE; went to PT, wore a sleeve for a little while, then everything was fine. Note that during that time, I had no trouble w/ pain, just swelling and tingly nerve stuff (still have the tingly nerve stuff, BS says it may eventually go away or may be permanent). A couple of weeks ago, I developed swelling in the top of my forearm right past my wrist, swelling was circular-ish and around 1.5-2 inches in diameter. It hurt just to barely touch it, no redness, not hot or anything. When I reached for something out or over my head, it hurt worse, w/ the pain running from between my index and middle finger knuckles in a straight line down to my tricep muscle. I was crazy busy at work so had no time for a dr appt, and I thought I remembered hitting my arm a couple of days before, so I decided to wait and see what happened. It's been a couple of weeks. It's not as swollen, but it's still swollen some. Pain's not as bad, but it still hurts to press on it and when I stretch my arm. It also hurts if I do a twisting motion, down that straight line from knuckle to wrist. It kinda feels like a small knot where it's swollen, but I can't say for sure because it hurts if I press it too hard. I did do some Self MLD but I have not tried to wear my sleeve because I knew it would hurt like a mother! Anyway, does it sound like a LE flare? Can you even have LE swelling in just one small spot like that? Since it's running in a line, could it be cording? I have no pain or ropey looking stuff in the arm pit. I guess I kinda wanted to get an idea of what it might be so I go to the correct doc or if I should just go back to the LE therapist. Don't want to go to the therapist if it's not LE or cording as that would be a waste of a co-pay. Or should i just suck it up and go to my not so lovely PCP?

I had them on both breasts (both were intraductal papillomas). You will have to go back for followup tests at 6 months.  I would definitely want them to go ahead and do the excisional because any other kind of biopsy showed papilloma, they would have to do the excisional anyway, so just go ahead and do it. I only took the biggie pain meds the first day, switched to Aleve after that. Had to be careful w/ exercise/bouncing for a week or so. Not to scare you, but at my six-month followup in June 14, I was diagnosed w/ my BC, low grade adenosquamous carcinoma. From what I read, this can sometimes come from intraductal papillomas, so that's why you want them to remove the whole papilloma, and you definitely want to keep current on your testing. EDIT: I should have said my papillomas were all benign, so don't worry right now that you have cancer.",

Then, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, my last remaining drain fell out (I was still on IV antibiotics from the infection), so my PS did an outpatient sx on me Labor Day, powerwashing out the pocket and replacing the TE on my right side, so that added another week. So I ended up being out 6 weeks. Also, that first week back I did not work full days (worked about 6 hrs each day).

My original plan was to go back PT today actually, but I ended up in the hospital 8/15-8/21 w/ breast cellulitis getting IV antibiotics. I am currently still on the iv abx at home (do then myself, home health nurse comes once a week for dressing changes on the picc line and to draw blood). Right now, unless something happens at my PS appt tomorrow, I plan on going back to work PT Monday 9/8, even if I am still on the abx and have this one drain in. I want to save the rest of my FMLA for my exchange sx plus any other possible problems (like the cellulitis problem). I will need to rearrange some stuff on my desk to ease the reaching. Otherwise, I will have to stand up every time I need to answer my phone or use my calculator, LOL! I have not had much of an issue w/ ROM at all. I am careful to not reach up too high over my head, but i am doing my own exercises to get that a little better. I did pull a stitch in my drain loading light stuff in my car, which is actually what got me to the hospital before the fever from the cellulitis kicked in. So, pay attention to that 5 lb weight limit!!!! My sister only had a lumpectomy and SNB (two sx bec they didn't get clear margins the first time, sx were a week apart). She delivers the mail (rural carrier), and she was out for right at 6 weeks because of all the reaching and carrying she had to do. The dr did give her restrictions when she went back (mainly getting help w/ heavier stuff), but her boss never really honored any of them, so she made do. All that to say to be very careful with the weight limits and ask for the restrictions on your back to work note and make sure they are enforced.",

I was not very big to begin with, so there was not a lot to fill. Expanders are either 500 or 550 cc; don't know how much we ended up with as we were going by looks more than anything. They look plenty big to me, LOL. My BMX was back on 7/30. It was relatively uneventful until I got cellulitis 2 weeks later and ended up in the hospital for about 6 days on IV abx then at-home IV abx (via picc line) for a month. :) So ya'll just try to keep everything near the drains as clean as you can. I'll check in as often as I can, but I'm kind of busy right now. My mother passed away a week ago (multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome), so I have a lot to do dealing with that.",

My infection had my PS slow things to a crawl to make sure I didn't lose my implant. Forgot to mention that he did end up opening me back up on 9/8 and powerwash out the infected side and putting in a new expander. The remaining drain on that side had fallen out on its own, and he woke up in the middle of the night worried about it not being in there and us not being able to see if any infection was draining out, so we did the second surgery (outpatient, no biggie). I wasn't give any special soap, told about the clean PJs, etc. I didn't even have to go to the hospital for any kind of pre-op appt! They just called me on the phone and asked me a bunch of questions I guess because prior to this I was healthy, so I didn't need the EKG, blood tests, etc. Also, I didn't have to be at the hospital until 4 PM, so bathing the night before or the morning of w/ special soap might not have made a difference. My PS also told me I could take a shower 48 hrs after surgery w/ the drains still in. If I were to do it again. I would figure out some way to cover the drain openings some in the shower. Some people wrap everything in plastic wrap, even the breasts. I didn't bother with that because I didn't have stitches on the breasts themselves (he used glue and steristrips so it could get wet no problem). I know for my exchange, I will be washing w/ something well (no Dial, that eats me up), and I will make sure I do the clean PJs. My plan is to lay a clean folded flat sheet over the fitted sheet each night and sleep inside that (easier than trying to change sheets). Don't knos yet if I will have drains yet, so I'll decide what to do about them later. I hope I don't. I had all for at the start, got two out after about 10 days I think. When I left the hospital after the infection, I got them to pull one, so i was left with the last one until it fell out 9/6. it was replaced on 9/8 w/ the second surgery, and I finally got it out I think around 9/21??? So I had at least one drain for almost two months. Not fun!",

Had the one drain on that side still in to keep an eye on the drainage (making sure it stayed clear, plus it was till over 30 cc per day). The Saturday before I was returning to work, the drain fell out on its own. At first the PS said just to keep gauze on it and come in for my scheduled appt that Wed. The next morning, he called me back worried because he dreamed about me all night and decided he wanted to go ahead w/ the powerwashing. So, I went to the hospital on Monday for outpatient surgery where he opened me back up on my right side, powerwashed it all out and put in a new TE and new drain. Came back home and stayed home for another week. My original plan was being out for 4 weeks w/ the BMX - the hospital stay pushed it to 5 weeks, then the second sx pushed it to 6 weeks. My PS decided to take his time on everything to let me heal up well and go very slowly taking things one at a time to lessen the chances of more problems and possibly losing the TE. My BMS was 7/30 when he did fill the TE some, and I did not have my first fill outside the sx until late Sept I believe (I'll have to go back and look at my old posts and I have forgotten so much!). 2 weeks later I was supposed to get another one, but he said I didn't look ready enough for one (skin was still shiny), so I waited another 2 weeks and got the second (and final!) fill on 10/30 I think. We then did the exchange on 12/19. He would have done it the first week of Dec, but I wanted it close to Christmas so I could use my 3 holiday days off and save my sick leave. So all in all, it took me almost 5 months from BMX to exchange. I personally would not rush things, and I definitely agree on a second opinion in your case.",

The one spot where I had a stitch poking out finally closed up (right side). I think I will just have to give up on side sleeping. Lying on my left causes my right boob (cancer side) to hurt; lying on my right is OK for awhile until both my arms go numb. Sleeping on my back causes lower back pain, so I have to put pillows under my knees to take the pressure off my back. That's not working as well lately, so I may have to splurge on one of those adjustable beds. Sleeping in the hospital bed w/ the legs/knees raised felt great on my back! Had my big 5-0 Saturday.
