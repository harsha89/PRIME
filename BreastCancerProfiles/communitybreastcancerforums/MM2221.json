Went back Wednesday for the Neulasta injection. My doctor has recommended the Claritin for a few days in efforts to ward off the joint pain. I have been sore, would I be better or worse without the Claratin. No matter, easy to take.  I think water has helped tremendously, I have no serious side effects :-). I have no appetite either but that might be a good thing.  On Friday, I returned for IV fluids which really did help and I hope to pretend that life is normal - one week before Christmas!",
