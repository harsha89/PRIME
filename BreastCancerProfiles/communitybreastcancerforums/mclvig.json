They are going to do neoadjuvant chemo first, which will reduce the tumor and then surgery.  This is the scariest thing in my life. The waiting of not knowing is enough to give a person a heart attack.  I find that I have to take a 1/2 of xanax to get to sleep at night. Don't laugh at the 1/2 dose, I don't handle drugs well.  HAHA wonder what chemo will feel like when all I can tolerate is a 1/2 dose of xanax. Anyway thanks for your posts. ",
