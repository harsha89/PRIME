While I think being as healthy and eating healthy as we can helps our bodies recover from things like chemo etc, it doesn't stop the cancer from happening as evidenced by your friends and your admission that you've always pretty much eaten healthy. I DO think however that supplements can help our fight in this disease. I do take some supplements myself! I think the standard treatment is AC/T or TAC, which is basically the same thing. And then down the list it goes for mets. I have a bunch of hats etc, this is my 3rd rodeo with no hair. I don't seem to be handling it emotionally as well as I have before. Sometimes I just want to blend in with the crowd yanno? But that itchiness was horrible and I was sweating under it too. Any ideas on the wig cap would be great !

My last treatment was Sept 3. I had a clear neck down scan on 10/3 but the brain MRI showed 2 small brain mets. One adjacent to the old site and one on top of my head. In the interium between scheduled cyber knife treatments, my oncologist decided we should check my cerebral spinal fluid for mets there (SCARY) I had 3 spinal taps (NEVER EVER AGAIN WITHOUT SEDATION) and they were negative THANK GOD. But in the middle of that, my father passed away. Its been so hard. And it hit really close to home internally for me. My mom is having a really hard time and I guess anyone would after 63 years of marriage ! I had cyberknife radiation 2 weeks ago, they decided on one very long treatment. Ive almost recovered from that, just get a little tiny tiny bit of vertigo when Im up for a while. Im not feeling as great as I wanted to off chemo, but I think that stuff just really exited my body about 10 days ago ! My hair all of a sudden started growing like CRAZY and my taste buds returned along with my hot flashes lol I go back Dec 7 for scans.",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2015 01:49PM - edited Jul 30, 2015 01:52PM by Lauralind5 Hey everyone ! Ugh weight. I've gained 50 lbs in the last year mostly due to all the steroids when I have the brain tumor/craniotomy and subsequent cyber knife going on plus inactivity during that and when I was so sick all spring until June. Now I get the steroids every week when Im getting treatment, and even though its only once its enough. Its frustrating though because I went from basically walking with a walker and not very far and sitting or lying all the time, to a more typical day. Although I only work part time I'm still doing stuff. No running marathons by any means but in comparison to a few months ago...one would think I would have lost a few lbs....NOT. Its so frustrating. I did talk to my onc last time and she said she had no problem with me trying to lose some weight as long as I wasn't doing anything crazy. I haven't really buckled too much with the move etc. and trying to find the most healthy things with chemo mouth presents a challenge. Lucy, do you feel like eating a higher protein diet helped the weight loss along? I'm having some not so nice neuropathy, my feet are so numb, esp my left foot and Ive noticed this week its been harder to type at work. Im taking supplements so we will see next week after my scans about a dose reduction or something. I don't want to stop this drug if its working if we can tweak the dosage and the neuropathy doesn't continue to increase. I am almost out of sick/vacation time and I have filled out my FMLA papers. After they are approved I can apply for shared leave where folks at work can donate time to me. Theres been quite a few people here asking to donate which is so nice. If I can continue part time that stretches any donated time to double. I'm figuring I will be covered until the end of the year. At that time, or when its winding down Im thinking about going ahead and doing the disability thing. This is my off week so in a couple of days into next week I'm hoping to feel a lot better. There's supposed to be a break in the weather humidity wise this weekend, looking forward to that ! I do have scans on Tuesday and Im already feeling the anxiety creep in.....",

I hope your new regimen works ! Bosco I didn't realize that Avastin crosses the blood brain barrier, hmmm. I will keep that in mind to ask about that at my next visit. Ive now lost 6 lbs (yay) and now losing my hair (boo) and I can say so far that the every 3 week Abraxane is going ok. I have one more week before the next infusion. I do get frustrated because I think recovery should be linear up up up and its not, its up and down and up and down. Hard to plan more than a day or so in advance. But at least the really bad leg pains only (ha) lasted a couple of days. I think next cycle if that starts up again Im going to medicate myself as much as possible to sleep, as nothing seems to ease the pain.",
