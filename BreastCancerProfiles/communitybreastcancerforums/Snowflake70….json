I still can't believe that I have cancer! I keep telling Brian that it feels like I'm in a bad dream and sooner or later I'll wake up and everything will be OK. I'm so lucky to have him. Today is our 13th anniversary, and all we've been doing is looking on the Internet for information and help. Kinda sad...I still can't grasp the idea! The first couple of days I didn't even want to talk about it. I understand now that I have to face the facts so I'm glad to have found this message board. You all sound so knowlegeable and helpful. I'm sure many of you have gotten a lot of support here and hopefully I can find some comfort and direction too. I'm going in for a CAT scan, and a bone scan tomorrow. I'm so worried! :-(",

Thank you very much for all your responses so far.  It has been very helpful to us.  We are definitely planning to get a second and maybe third opinion once we get the diagnosis. Unfortunately we have been thrown a bit of a curve ball in the process.  My wife posted in the middle of the day on Monday after the CT scan.  We went back in the afternoon for the bone scan and got back home at about 4:30.  At 5:00, the breast surgeon called to tell us that the CT scan from earlier in the day revealed multiple blood clots in her lungs and that we had to go straight back to the hospital so she could be treated immediately for pulmonary embolism. She packed a few things in case she would be there overnight (we didn't know what to expect), and we got to the emergency room at 6:00.  They were waiting for her and took her right in and started her on heparin - a blood thinner.  She had to wait for some blood tests to come back before they could admit her, but they finally moved her to a regular inpatient room at 1:30 this morning.  Unfortunately, it looks like she will be there for at least 4 days for the treatment to get things stablized. The worst part is that we still don't know anything more about the extent of the breast cancer because this new issue has taken a front seat right now.  I am still going to try to get the pathology report from the breast surgeon tomorrow so we at least know what we are working with on that end. This was the last thing the poor girl needed right now.  At least this helps explain why she has been so tired and out of breath lately.  You hate to say that you are glad to have breast cancer, but that is the only reason she had the CT-scan that found the blood clots.  It sounds crazy, but breast cancer might have saved her life. On the other hand, breast cancer might be the cause of the blood clots.  Has anyone else had a problem with pulmonary embolism?",

All 3 biopsy samples from the 2.5cm breast tumor are Grade 3.  The single lymph node sample was also cancerous.  The CT scan and bone scan revealed no metastatic activity and the MRI revealed a separate suspicious area in the right breast.  The left breast appears clear.  She is ER-/PR-/HER2-.  They still don't know if she is Stage IIB or IIIA. Based on that data, the doctors recommended chemotherapy first followed by surgery and then likely radiation.  She is starting chemotherapy tomorrow (4/10) and will do 6 treatments, once every three weeks.  The cocktail of choice is TC (Taxotere/Carboplatin). We really like the oncologist and communication appears to be one of his strong suits.  We considered waiting to get a second medical oncology opinion, but ultimately decided to get started and nip this thing in the bud before it moves anywere else.  The tumor has definitely grown over the past month, and the triple negative deal worries us. I just want to be confident that the chemotherapy drugs which the oncologist plans to use are the best available.  There is a lot of information about TCH (Taxotere/Carboplatin/Herceptin) for women that are ER-/PR-/HERP+, but I haven't been able to find anything about TC for triple negative women.  Supposedly this is a friendlier version of the Taxol/Cisplatin regimen.  Has anyone out there had this combination of drugs?  Is this a standard regimen?  How is the quality of life (side effects) with this regimen?  Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks, Brian",

I've been taking Coumadin for the last few days and I feel better. I still have shortness of breath and my heart rate goes through the roof sometimes, but I think I'll be OK now that I know what to do. I'll have to take Coumadin for at least 6 more months and keep having blood tests regularly in order to check if my INR is within normal range. My breast surgeon came to see me at the hospital. She said that the tests showed that the cancer is only in my breast and lymph nodes. I'm very relieved! I was so worried that it might have gone to other parts of my body too. She also said that I should probably start with chemo first. I have an appointment with her and the oncologist again tomorrow morning and I'm sure we'll go into more details. Thank you so much for all your advice and your support! It means a lot to me to be able to talk to people who know what I'm going through.  I feel so lonely sometimes during the day, but then I come here and it feels like you're the only ones that understand. I try so hard not to make Brian feel he's not a part of what's going on. It's really hard sometimes. I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for him. He wants to take care of me, I know, but there's really nothing he can do about it. I really wish there was! :-) Well, that's all. I better try to go to sleep (another sleepless night, I'm sure).  Hugs to all of you and thanks again! PS Deb , thanks for giving us the names of your doctors. I'll look them up. We live in Mason, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati.",

They just got funding for a trial vaccine only for triple negative breast cancer. We talked to their breast cancer coordinator today and she said that the chemo I'm going to start tomorrow  (a combination of Taxotere and Carboplatin) is the same that they would have given me too. They haven't started the trials yet, but from what she said they should start soon though. They're looking for women who have already completed their chemo and are post-surgery, so by the time I'm done with chemo and surgery I'm hoping I can give it a try.
