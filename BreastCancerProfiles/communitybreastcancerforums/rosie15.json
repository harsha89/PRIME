I actually got a biopsy and an ultrasound and thankfully the biopsy revealed benign. The Dr that performed the ultrasound said the lump was actually my rib that was palpated and right above that was a fibroadenoma (sp) which is a benign lump commonly found in younger women. When the Dr first told you your lump was just your bone, was that before or after an ultrasound/biopsy? I felt like a hypochondriac in front of the Dr and she was just trying to get me out. Thank you so much for your time, Elizabeth :)",
