I had surgery on 7/11- Lumpectomy and Sentinel Node removed. In the area where my sentinel node was removed I evidently have a build up of lymphatic fluid which has caused a painful lump unde\\rneath the incision. I saw my surgeon yesterday and he says it will go down over time and wants to see me in 4 weeks. I'm not sure I can handle 4 weeks of this kind of pain. He's recommended I see a specific breast cancer physical therapist, which I am calling today. I'm also concerned about developing Lymphedema -which is incurable. Anyone else having these same issues? Suggestions? ",
