All the very best to you courageous women fighting this incredible battle, Rickster",

Am I jeopardizing anything by not creating a clean slate for my 'new hair' to grow from?  Or will the old stubble rejuvenate itself & start growing eventually?  Thanks for all your prior assistance and best wishes to all!!!  Rickster",
