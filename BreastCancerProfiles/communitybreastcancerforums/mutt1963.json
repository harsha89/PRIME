I had cording after a pretty extensive biopsy and then all through treatment. The only relief I got was through the assistance of a good physical therapist that is Lana certified. I did have seroma's after my bilateral mastectomy and those were taken care of by my surgeon but my medical Oncologist was the one that had to refer me to the physical therapist. Hope you get some relief from the pain and anxiety of feeling like strange things are going on with your body. Just because your bodies reaction to this stuff might be normal doesn't mean you have to keep suffering with the pain.",

He is switching me to andrimycin for 4 rounds if tollerated. I was due to get 6 rounds TC originally. I thankyou for posting this as Ive only been able to find a few others that have had bad reactions while on the same chemo. I also saw my primary care physician after my second round for a possible UTI but broke out in hives before I was able to get the cipro filled so I know that was not the cause or contribute to the reaction. Unlike you Ive never had an allergic reaction to any medications but did have allergies to environmental things as a child. I hope your chemo goes well and your symptoms subside.",

I am still periodically breaking out slightly when I get tired and benadryl has been able to take care of it. The docs are confused about my continued reaction also but don't think its environmental.",
