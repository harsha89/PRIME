Background: Had a stereotactice needle biopsy to check out microcalcifications.  Pathology report showed LCIS and ADH around calcifications (I think). Marker put in. Two questions about excisional biopsies: 1) Should I take the day off following the biopsy? 2) How do they know that they are removing enough when there is no lump? Do they check somehow when they are doing the proceedure or do you have to wait the 2-3 days for the pathology report to see if you've got it all or merely hit the tip of the iceburg?
