Turned out to be 3 of those.  From what I understand the procedure is similar as far as the bx part goes. They asked me if I wanted something to relax me.  I knew I did. They gave me 1mg Ativan tablet.  It really helped.  They numbed the area with lidocaine.  I was really worried about being able to feel any of the bx.  I didn't feel anything but a little stinging after as they put the lidocaine in. Not as bad as the dentist to me.  My 4cm lump was really deep so I was scared to death I would be able to feel that one.  I never felt any of them. They were really good and told me each time when I would hear the needle click.  I was sleepy from the Ativan so to me it went very fast. I have had a MRI since.  It was not bad. I will ask for something to relax me next time on that one. I found it hard to lay that still for that long. But my was diagnostic. I don't thin yours would be as long as mine since I was having both breast done and they were looking at all areas. As large as my one 4 cm area was and then the other 3 I am very blessed my came back atypia ductal hyperplasia. I am now taking Tamoxifen and on the MRI, mammogram 6 month schedule.  I will keep you in my prayers.  I hope this helped some.  ",
