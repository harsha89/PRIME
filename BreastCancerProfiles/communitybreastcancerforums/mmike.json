I have tried going to one's that my General Dr. has recommended, however, I haven't found anyone whom I am comfortable with. I think that it is important to feel comfortable with the Dr. who is going to be doing a mast. I am only 24, and very scared. I want a Dr. who is personable as well as capable--aparently that is hard to find in surgeons. Does anyone have any ideas on how to find good (preferable female) Dr.'s in my area? Thank you in advance. Mike. I am from Northern California...Thank you all! Log in to post a reply",

Beware of a loud clicking noise if they are doing a ultrasound guided biopsy--I wasn't prepared for the clicking sound. My prayers are with you...good luck!",
