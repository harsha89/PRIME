I've had 2 fills, each at 50CC's, so I'm currently 450 CC's both sides. The 1st fill went off without a hitch- no pain at all. The 2nd was quite different and I have had several capillaries 'pop' on the top, cleavage and sides... and just overall tightening and pain. This fill was 3 weeks ago- so I'm a little past the point of being uncomfortable for a few days. Just wanting opinions for those in this situation- have you ever asked the PS to remove fluid? I was already at the maximum desired size- to stretching the skin is no longer relevant. Any luck with getting them to do this merely out of comfort? Log in to post a reply",
