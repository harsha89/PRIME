And honestly I could tell the nurses were just as frustrated because they haven't run across something like this probably in a very long time. In fact one nurse just didn't want to give up she was determined to do it, but I finally told her to stop. I just could not take anymore pain. Scared to death for tomorrow. They get only one chance. if I have to make them take me back to the operating table and put the monitor over my chest to look on the screen of where my port is and then have them insert the needle that is what I will do.",

I do have an appointment with my Onc between now and my taxol appointment. I'll post when I get that. I totally understand about the anxiety part. Never seems to go away much. They have have had a hard time every time when it comes to putting that darn needle in my port. They never can find it the first time. I get poked at least two to three times and have several nurses come by to try to find the right spot. So now I get extra anxious knowing I'm going to once a week its like seriously can you find the port the first time. So a lot of my anxiety comes from that fear. my hope is with taxol the side effects of major chemo brain, stomach disorder, and plain old severe tiredness, goes away with taxol.knitting please let me know how your first round goes if you can. I know the first round is pretty tough just because they stalk you up with benadryl and steroids and everything else they can give you in preparation of any reaction.",

After all that we finally got going on the taxol. Noballergic reactions for me so that is good and now we just wait and see on se. It's cumulative so the 9th and 10th week usually really sets in the fatigue. But then you're almost done. I will take glutamine 24 hrs after infusion for 4 days.

Now I want everyone to know my Taxol story: I had no immediate reaction during infusion with Taxol. Week 1-2: Took the usual pre-meds:  allergy pill, heartburn, and steroids.  After the very first dose, I had side effects of usual fatigue on Fri-Sun. Bone pain was extremely intense. Worse than the Nueoprin shots. Over the counter pain medicine barely put a dent in the pain. Week 3: Stopped the pre-meds because I had no allergic reaction during past infusions. Side effects remain the same, on vicodin now because the bone pain and neuropathy was so intense. Week 4-7:  Onc lowered by dose by 25%. My side effects were above and beyond what he told be to expect. Onc not concerned that it will have any negative impact on treatment plan. Side effects slightly milder on week 4, but by 5-7 weeks, back up to severe pain and neuropathy. Week 8:  Same lowered dose. Completed infusion by 4:30 p.m. (Thursday). By 7:00 p.m by face was extremely hot (flushing) broke out with a rash on my chin and lower part of my face. Chalked it up to heat flash. Went to bed and woke up Friday morning with my face, bottom lip, bridge of my nose and eyes completely swollen. DH immediately retrieved Benadryl for me. Took 25 mg and called the onc. Talked with the nurses first and they didn't have much to say for explanation. Finally, in touch with onc. and he confirmed that I was not having breathing issues or throat closure, etc.  and he told me to take allergy pills for the next few days. I took Claritin for 5 days, with the swelling finally subsiding three days later. He set me an appointment with Allergy specialist. I met with the allergist yesterday. He told me I had a severe allergic reaction with the Taxol. Both he and onc were very surprised the allergy came up on my 8th infusion. My onc said he's never seen this before. The allergist basically told me in no uncertain terms that taking one more Taxol would be too risky, because there is no way of knowing if I might have a reaction so bad that I couldn't recover, or, I could be fine. He said he wouldn't take that risk. Switching to Taxotere wouldn't be beneficial because they are sister drugs and the same risk remains. So that left me with a discussion with my Onc. on what to do. He stated there really isn't any other drug to put me on and confirmed that he thought I would be ok. stopping the treatments. The risk outweighs the benefit now. However, like all doctor's who don't want to be sued, kindly told me that there's no guarantee that stopping early would or wouldn't have an affect on reoccurrence. There's no way to know. So with trepidation, I decided to stop the Taxol treatments. Of course I am happy now to be done with chemo. A/C and Taxol both kicked my butt in different ways. Now I must live knowing that I have done everything that doctor's have told me to do. I would have done the 12 doses if I could have. My life is in Gods hands and this situation is out of my control. I still have radiation for 5 weeks to complete. I truly hope that is smooth sailing.   Please understand that these were my side effects and probably won't have any bearing on anyone else's treatment. Thanks for reading. I guess I felt the need to write all this out because there is still part of me that feels a bit guilty quitting early. I just don't want this to come back (just like the rest of you feel too). Prayers, love, and support to all of you. - Janine ps I posted this on the weekly Taxol thread too.",

The reason for the quick turn around from Lump to Mastectomy surgery is because the margins came back too large. So the mastectomy is the only option. They want to start chemo 3 weeks after surgery, but if my drain is still in they will wait until it's been removed. Surgeon told me to \"put the left breast on the back burner and let's just take care of the right breast \"the bad boob\". However, today I am wondering why? shouldn't I just do both? I am 46 years old with children, marriage and a career. I don't want to do this again. I called and left a message with the dr. asking the same. Waiting for a return call. Bone scan (PET) tomorrow. I will take advice and pop a Xanax to muddle through. Heck I took one last night just to make the brain stop spinning for awhile. I am so glad I found the website and all of you. I already am starting to feel like I have a bit of control again! Blessings to you all!",

I asked the doctor to take my left side as well however they said they couldn't wait for me to start chemo. She said typically if you take a good side it tends to be the one that gets infections and takes longer to heal and they said honestly I needed to start on chemo as soon as possible. So I will have it done eventually during Reconstruction. Which will be one year after I finish rads. Start chemo on the 20th",

I must tell you I do not miss my breast at all. I feel so relieved to know that most of the cancer now is out of my body. Just wanted you all know that my bone scan came out clean and my CT scan it came out clean with the exception of a tumor found on the adrenal gland. However Onc and the surgeon don't seem too concerned about it because of its size. I will go in for further CAT scan targeting just that gland I feel really good about everything. Just wanted to share some good news. Start chemo in 3 weeks god bless to all of you out there. Janine.
