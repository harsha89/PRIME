I will ask tomorrow if they are really treating that whole area. Thanks to all of you for sharing your journey and validating all that I feel at every stage. Hope everyone has a restfull evening. ",

Starting to go from pink to red in some areas. Hopefully it will calm down this weekend. Some days I feel great, others I'm so exhausted I don't want to breath. Has anyone else experienced this roller coaster? Thanks for sharing your journey.",

I had learned almost everything from this wonderful site! Love this place! Will do 30 sessions, getting all the insurance stuff lined out then will schedule. They said to brew green tea daily and spritz my breast with it several times a day, had not heard that one. Also called in a prescription cream. DIV - love your puppy, my name is Riley too! I admire your attitude to stay positive, even when it's hard. To all the others on this thread, thankful to have you to share this journey. Today is my hubby's birthday - cake is in the oven!! Love him so much! Hope you all have a good evening.",
