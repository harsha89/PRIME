I recently had my MRI at a new facility -- I switched because I didn't love my doctor and this new place came very highly recommended. There is something on the MRI report that I'm having a hard time deciphering -- can anyone here shed some light on macrolobulated and kinetics? These weren't mentioned in the previous MRI report I received from February -- At the 1:00 right axis, 4 cm from the nipple, there is a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm macrolobulated heterogeneously enhancing mixed-T2 signal mass (axial image 94/192 and sagittal image 98/301) demonstrating mixed progressive (type I) and plateau (type II) kinetics which has not appreciably changed in size compared to prior MRI 2/24/2017. There's also this (which I'm less concerned with I think?) -- At the 3:00 to 4:00 left axis, 6 cm from the nipple, there is a 0.8 x 0.3 cm T2-hyperintense enhancing mass (axial image 65/192) which has slightly decreased in size compared to prior outside MRI dated 2/24/2017 and demonstrates progressive (type I) kinetics. Taking into consideration differences in technique, this enhancing mass likely corresponds to the 2:00 enhancing mass on outside MRI. Birads 3 Also worth mentioning, I have biopsy confirmed PASH and moderate parenchymal enhancement. I'd like to biopsy, but it's been recommended I wait another six months and we'll re-asses then after another MRI and ultrasound. Any thoughts, esp on the first finding at 1:00 axis would be appreciated. Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",
