I am 43 now, and I got the call yesterday that I need an ultrasound after my mammogram this past Tuesday. I go for that this afternoon. I went to see my regular MD last night, and I feel a bit more positive. I wish I could offer you great words of advice. I know how you are feeling, and I am sending positive wishes your way.",
