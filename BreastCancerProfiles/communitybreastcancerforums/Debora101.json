I just want to tell you that I underwent bilateral mastectomies last fall and reconstructed with DIEP flaps. I have NO REGRETS! If you find the right plastic surgeon, you have nothing to be afraid of! I am in favor of narrowing the chances of recurrence down to the maximum that I can. I respect any women who are scared to loose their breasts, but for the women out there who are debating on what to do, I want to encourage them to LET GO OF THEIR FEARS and know what the options of reconstructions are! Good luck!",
