I had something similar happened to me but the first thing my doctor did was give me antibiotics as he thought is could be mastitis. I also had lumpiness but after a mammo and ultrasound only cysts where found. I am not done with my process since more has happened after that but I just wanted to let you know that there are other conditions that would make your breast swell. However I would advise that if you don't fell comfortable with your doctor's opinion to go to another one. The fact that she sounded like sheÂ has no knowledgeable of IBC is something to be concern about. I would ask for a second opinion even if your mammogram and ultrasound come back clear.",
