I wasn't given a choice- I want to throw everything I can at this cancer so if it comes back, I don't do that the \"shoulda, woulda, coulda\".

I got really annoyed with the Social Worker and one of the techs. They keep saying, \"Well you have a choice- you don't have to do this.\" Like any of us had a choice about breast cancer. We didn't get to go down a menu and say, \"Well I'll have a small breast cancer, hold the lymph nodes, and a side salad with dressing on the side\". They told us- lumpectomy comes with radiation and I'm trying to complete it. The tech tells me- well we've had people just do a couple and never come back. Is that supposed to make me feel \"comfortable\". What happened to those people? Did no one give a damn and try to find a way to help them get through this very stressful part of a horrible ride? It takes all my strength not to jump off the table and run out crying from sadness, pain, stress, frustration. Every day I just want to drive right past and not go in but I DONT want a recurrence and I don't want to suffer and die from breast cancer.Â ",

I believe the recurrence rate was similar or just a little bit better. I don't remember whether the age was above or below 50. I think that might be something that would concern me about your case. I am very worried about the micromet even though I did not have LVI. I can't do this \"cancer\" thing again. And you only get one shot at radiation therapy so you have to get it right the first time. My tumor was IDC 2.8cm and DCIS 3.5 cm with a sprinkling of LCIS to complicate the whole mess. And nothing, not even radiation, does anything about LCIS. I just don't want to screw this thing up",

I have some side effects from other medications that I am taking plus I just have a stomach that shows stress that way. I started taking my AI because I waited to make a decision about surgery (bilateral mastectomy vs radiation) before being forced to choose radiation. Plus I have been reading about skin reactions from AIs on another discussion board. The nerve endings in my scars are reacting to the radiation and causing pain. My RO said she is going to watch because she does not want me to start having lymphadema in the arm. Azrescue- I would check with the RO that wants to do the hypofractionated because both the Canadian and UK START A and B trials went up to Stage 2 BC. Stage III may be different ( or are you grade 3? I get those mixed up). I think there is some difference in the radiation when they have to do the clavicle and intramammary lymph nodes. I don't hold my breath but I also don't take very large breaths normally. And I am large breasted too. 44 DDD before surgery- who knows now after lumpectomy?I can't bear to look at either breast. I feel like they betrayed me.",

The problem I see for me is that I am node positive- 1 micromet in 7 lymph nodes and getting whole breast radiation. I just wonder if I am getting enough care- no one wants more radiation than necessary but I worry about having that micromet and length of time I had waited between end of chemo and now. My RO is also doing this reduce complications that could be life-threatening.I have read all the studies, especially the START 2 trials and it seems promising. But no one wants to be 2,3,5,10 years down the line and they discover it was the wrong thing to do for your cancer. The problem is that most- not all of the doctors recommend the 33 sessions. The micromet and Luminal B nature of my tumor (ER+, PR- and Her2-) also concern some of the RO. But I feel stupid saying, \"Gee, I think I need more radiation.",
