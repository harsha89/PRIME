You  will get through this and we will be here waiting to hear from you. I know it is not the same as physical comfort, but still very real. I went through my diagnosis waiting period with very much anxiety as I have no family and my husband is in Iraq. I did not want to tell him anything until I had the results of the biopsy. If I had not found this board to gain strength and knowledge from reading all the messages it would have been much more nerve wracking. Even though I never posted I found great comfort from the fantastic women (and men) on these discussion boards. Hugs to you and don't be afraid to ask your dr. for something to help you relax a little during this very tough time. ",
