    "Content": "Locked_toward_the_future wrote: Hi, I started Xeloda in Feb 2011, and after progressively successful CT Scans my ONC and I decided I should take a Xeloda break. I stopped on 05/11/12. My mets is in the soft tissue of my mediastinum. Also had some spots on my liver that are now too faint to recognize on my last CT. One of the reasons I am taking a break is that I do not want to become immune to this treatment and hope it will work for me should I need it again. Does anyone have a similar story or took a break from it and went back on? I'm not taking any other meds. I look forward to your comments and questions.
