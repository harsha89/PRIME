    "Content": "eamurphy wrote: I'm 17 and discovered a fibroadenoma in my breast when I was 13, but had it checked and reassured that it was benign 2 years later when I was 15. Three more were discovered at my last ultra sound 6 months ago, and since then they have been hurting me when I exercise, and no matter how much I am reassured there is always a small thought in the back of my mind that one of them could be cancerous. I'm also worried that the abnormal cell growth will raise my risk of breast cancer, especially because I have it on both my mother's and my father's side of the famliy. I'm thinking about having them removed as soon as I go into my next ultra sound and can schedule a surgery after finding out if I qualify. I would feel comfortable knowing they went undre a microscope and got a good look at them. What is your opinion? Log in to post a reply",
