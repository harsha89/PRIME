A breast center coordinates each step and saves you the nightmare of schlepping your records and waiting between steps. Especially if you had positive nodes, you'll want to know what kind of chemo and radiation.  The receptors on the cells help to decide if hormonal therapy is indicated. Will they be doing lumpectomy VS mastectomy. If you'll be having a mastectomy, you'll have to consider unilateral versus bilateral and the type of reconstruction if you so choose.  Some reconstructions require a certain body type, and some can require a longer recovery to full strength. Take a family member or tape recorder to the appointment.   There is a lot to digest. Best of luck.  I know it is scary, but once you have a plan of attack, it gets better.

My little monkeys are interfering with my keyboard.  I thought I submitted a response a minute ago, but it has disappeared into the ether. I'm more sore today than yesterday, but that's because I took a shower prior to my first post-op appt.  The drains stay in a couple of more days.  My arterial catheter site has a bruise the size of my palm on the inside of my right elbow.  It's pretty tender, too Overall, each day is better. I'll be happy when I can return to the wine and hot baths.  They are my sanity. DukeMom, I couldn't imagine going through all the diagnostics over again.  That is one reason I took the coward's way out and had the whole mess removed.  My PS was excited to be able to get 60 cc into the expander at the time of surgery.  I actually have a hint of cleavage.  Wishing you peace along this long path.

The weirdest part is being able to feel the drains and expanders under the skin.  It's like a sci fi movie.  It's comforting knowing the monsters will evolve into B cups.  Kerry, I'm looking forward to cleavage.  Glad your exchange went well. Hey Janb, I had prophylactic bilateral MX for LCIS.  I am a control freak who didn't want to worry about any new bump.  I also have a wonderfully supportive husband, who despite major queasies, has been a trooper. The girls here are great to lean on if you have fears that you don't want to worry your husband about. Thanks Shelly, Kathy, and Carol for keeping an eye out for me.  While the other side is lumpier, the drugs are better. Kathy, I guess you'll have to have cocktail for me for a few days. Have a great day, all. Carol(AZ)",

Needle aspirate? etc There are a few tests they do on the cancer cells to determine what kind of receptors it may have.  If it is not a very aggressive lesion (eg ADH), they have large clean margins, and the lymph nodes are clean, you may not need anything further.  Unfortunately, until the results are back, you won't know what the recommendations will be.  Remember, most masses are benign anyway.  Hang in there.

It's too soon to know what the final look will be.  As scar tissue forms internally, it will possibly pull the nipple closer to normal.  Remember, your surgeon wants you to look as symmetrical as you do.  In their experience, this may be the best post op position for the final overall appearance.  Hang in there.  We know, and we care.
