After today we will be half way done with the monster chemo sessions. Barb's white cell count was so low last week that she needed a series of nueprogen injections last week to boost her counts so she can be ready for today.  The neuprogen will now be a regular part of the routine and has its own side effects. Sadly , we now have a good idea of what a chemo \"routine\" is. After the drip today,  Barb will feel ok, mostly because the ENORMOUS amount of anti-nausea and anti-side effect meds that they give her. That seems to start to wear off around day 3. Then it is downhill with multiple side effects for about 12 days. Nothing seems to help. Then she slowly gets better until day 21 and another round of chemo. Its both good and bad in knowing what to expect. Good in the fact that you know what to expect and can deal with it the best way possible. Bad in the fact that you know what is coming, and its not good. We do know that this treatment, although taking its toll, is taking its toll on cancer too! If we can stay on schedule, we will have chemo on Nov 14th (the only on in November), then December 5th and 26th. The best Christmas present we can ask for is to get  this behind us and start 2008 fresh.  Lets pray this happens.",

No other treatments this month then 2 in December. She wakes up feeling like crap and gets better as the day goes on. I keep giving her small things to eat throughout the day since she says she feels sick all the time. A little something in her stomach seems to settle it somewhat.",

Somewhere in between Demi Moore in GI Jane and Sigorney Weaver in Alien. She has never worn the wig we bought but has worn a baseball cap or beanie when we go out. I have noticed that people give her the \"look\". Yesterday (a good day, yay!) she went shopping with her girlfriend and forgot her hat! She didnt realize it until she was walking into the store.  Her girlfriend asked her if she wanted to go back and get her hat. She said \"SCREW IT\". I'm so proud of her and her strength.  Ya know, its our reality. no hair, chemo, all the side effects. two more and then a great 2008!!!!!! GOOD VIBES!!!!!",
