My dr sent me to have a ultrasound they then did a mamogram and biopsy. They did not find any cancer. After about 6 months of pain I was sent to a surgen who wanted to remove the lump. He did and said it looked like cancer he thought it was when he removed it but the test results said it was scar tissue. I don't know why I would have scar tissue. Now I have heard a lot of dr telling people they have scar tissue when it is cancer. I'm wondering if it could have been cancer. Log in to post a reply",
