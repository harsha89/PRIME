    "Content": "AngelSunshine wrote: Hi everyone -- I am grateful for this forum and the strength and compassion of all of you. It has helped me greatly so far. I was diagnosed via core needle biopsy about a month ago with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (right breast). The tumor is about 1.1 centimeters and is relatively low-grade (Grade 1) with a Ki-67 of 9; Nottingham score of 4. It is highly estrogen receptor positive (>95%) and progesterone receptor positive 65%; HER2 negative.  I am 54 years old with no history of cancer. The problem is, I have relatively severe liver damage from past hepatitis C, and resultant acute kidney failure. I was in the hospital for >40 days earlier this year with the renal failure which has mostly resolved for now. However, no one will treat my breast cancer because I am not a candidate for surgery/lumpectomy (bleeding risk due to liver damage, and potential damage of anesthesia). I am also not a candidate for chemo or radiation due to liver and kidney toxicity. So I am taking anastrozole (ugggh.... nasty side effects!) for now, and nothing else has been done or is being planned. From what my medical oncologist said last time I saw her, she believes I will die of liver failure before I would die of breast cancer. She almost  literally said that. Well, not on my watch. I really need to get this cancer out of me! Now to my question -- do any of you have any direct experience with cryoablation of breast tumor? I have read some things about it here and other online sites, and it seems like it might be a good option for me. Perhaps the only option. But I know it is experimental. Does anyone have any information about a clinic/doctor who does this in the US? I am in the Midwest but willing to travel anywhere in the US.  Thank you so much for any info ~ Angel Log in to post a reply",
