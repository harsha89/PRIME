Can't quite believe I'm going through a full six sessions of chemo as I thought I was just going to take Hercepton...  Apparently the Hercepton works much better with additional drugs....I'm in a comprehensive cancer center with great people - nurses and doctors - who I trust to take good care of me.   I look forward to joining the discussion as I go through this challenge.   ",
