I asked my husband if he could feel anything ( I was hoping that it was my imagination), unfortunately, he felt it as well. Neither of us could get over how hard the lump is, needless-to-say, we're now even more concerned. Actually I'm terrified, but I managed not to burst into tears so I guess that's something.  Thank you for your time.",

The findings; I have a 1.5 cm mass, that is high density with indistinct borders in my left breast and unexplained weight loss (30 pounds since mid-May, 15 of which has been in the last 2 weeks) Recommendation by the radiologist, wait six months and repeat mammogram. I followed up with my PCP, who said he was not comfortable with the findings nor the recommendation. So, he referred me to a surgeon, who did a breast exam and said I have significant irregularities in my left breast. Given what he felt and the report of the tests, he was not comfortable with the findings and recommendation. He recommended a Breast MRI, or Stereotactic Breast Biopsy, because he said this needed to be moved on quickly. Unfortunately, the insurance company denied the MRI, but approved the biopsy. So, his office tried to schedule with the hospital that performed the mammogram and ultrasound. They refused, due to the recommendation made by the radiologist. After that refusal, his office tried to schedule with another hospital. However, the other hospital is a sister hospital to the first one, they refused to perform the biopsy. I contacted my PCP about this, now his office is attempting to have me seen by a surgeon affiliated with a different hospital system. I am so frustrated, afraid, and confused by all of this. How can 2 doctors say something is wrong, with 1 of them performing 100+ breast cancer related surgeries a year, be overruled by the hospitals? Just feel so lost, not knowing what to do. Fortunately, I have a great support system, including my cousin who is a 6 year breast cancer survivor and a friend that just finished radiation for breast cancer.

I will look into the suggestions you gave me, I really am appreciative.  Yesterday, I received the call that a surgeon in another hospital network will see me. My appointment is Thursday, July 17th at 11:00 am, my PCP set it up. Hopefully, this hospital system will perform the biopsy. This fighting and waiting is taking a huge toll on my nerves, I keep using DBT skills that I learned when my daughters were in counseling, but it's very difficult. However, I keep trying to move forward, handle my responsibilities, and prepare for the arrival of my granddaughter, in September. I am so tired though. Then to add to everything I was hospitalized in May due to my large and small intestines looping around one another, we were informed yesterday by our insurance that they will not pay the bill (mind you, they had approved now changed their mind). Our insurance is oh so fabulous (heavy sarcasm). In-addition, my pH level was checked and we have been told that it is very acidic. Both saliva and urine had been tested. Does anyone have suggestions for that? Thank you for your time, as well as help. Have a nice weekend.",
