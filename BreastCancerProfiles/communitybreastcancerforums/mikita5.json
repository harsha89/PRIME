It was a very tough surgery and a tough recovery, but I did it and I'd do it all again in a heartbeat. My suggestion is to research, read, research, read, research.........make sure this is what you want and be sure it's the right thing for you.  I had DCIS in my right breast. After mx, pathology came back with 2 more spots in that breast, so my decision was the right one --- for me.. Good luck in your decision. Please come back and let us know what you decide.",

If you need to talk, feel free to pm me. I'll help in any way I can. Take your time and research, research, research all your options and don't do anything in haste. Make sure your decision is the right one for you. Good luck and God bless you in this trying time. Kathy",

My oncologist, doc, husband, relatives thought I was 'crazy' for opting for this 'drastic' decision, BUT after mx, pathology came back with two more spots of DCIS in the affected breast that mamo didn't see... I followed my heart, stuck to my decision and now know it was the best decision for me. I am NOT saying this is the route to go. I'm simply saying this was MY way to deal with bc.  Everyone just needs to follow their own heart. No one else should make the decision for us. Go with your gut instinct. It's usually the right one.
