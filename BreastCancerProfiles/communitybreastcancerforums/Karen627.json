      "Content": "Karen627 wrote: Hello, everyone. I'm Karen. I've been lurking here for only a couple of days, and I've been really reassured by the knowledge and support offered by everybody here. I had an inconclusive mammogram last month, and a second mammogram and ultrasound a couple of days ago. The ultrasound tech spent quite a while with me, including coming back in for further scanning after showing the initial scans to the radiologist. (The further scanning included my right armpit; nothing was found there, though.) Turns out that according to the radiologist, I have something like every benign thing possible. however, there were two areas in my right breast that he wants biopsied, each 1 cm or less. The BIRADS category is 4b, which I know is most often not malignant; however, he immediately recognized all of the benign things that I have, which makes me wonder -- what was different about those two areas? Just driving myself nuts. It doesn't help that the biopsy (or biopsies, I guess, since there'll be two of them) are happening the Thursday before New Year's Eve weekend, which means a longer wait for results. Anyway, I'm worried that with all of the benign things I have, the fact that the radiologist couldn't say those two areas were also benign doesn't bode well. Am I panicking over nothing? (Wow, am I glad you're all here, even if you can't offer any definitive answers. Thanks so much.) Log in to post a reply",

I keep thinking of my husband, looking on WebMD after he ate something that disagreed with him, and somehow managing to convince himself he had cancer. I asked him how he was feeling, and he said he'd only been hurting for a little while, took some Pepto Bismol, and felt better, but he was still worried. I told him, \"Either you're fine, or Pepto cures cancer.\" Since then I've told him to stay off the Internet If he doesn't feel well. You'd think I could take my own advice, right? Thanks again (and thank you for the perspective, cycle-path!) :)",
