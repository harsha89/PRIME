She was grateful she didn't need to have any further treatment, including no medications.  She was fine until the age of 87, when she developed AML.  She did chemotherapy and did achieve remission for about 2-weeks before relapsing.  She lasted nearly 9 months and then passed away.   Mom's been gone for 7 years now - and I still miss her. Do what you feel is best for your mom.",
