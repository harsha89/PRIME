I wil have 4 ACs every two weeks followed by 12 weeks of Taxol. 2 weeks ago I got a slylish haircut (like Katie Holmes). I know I have another 2-3 weeks to enjoy it. I did get a wig that is similar to my new hair cut. In addition to a wig, I bought new hats, and something similar to a wig but without a top part, something you can wear with a cap. I think I'll find it more usefull in the summer. Looking forward to chatting with you all and sharing the experience. I hope we all will have an easy 'ride' and grow toghether in the next 6 months.",

I am sure you can ask your oncologist or his nurse for a place where you can obtain it in your area. If there is a support group in your area, then you can ask other women for the list of stores.

The side effects after the first AC were pretty bad - nausea and fatique for 10 days out the 14 day. S/E after the second AC were manageable; s/e after 3d were pretty bad. I really felt good the second week after each AC on Thu, Fri, Sat, and Sun. These are the days when you wake and feel as normal as you can be, as if there were no bc diagnose, as if I am not going thru chemo. I tried to socialize and be busy as much as possible to make up  for all the days that I spend at home now, sometimes not even leaving the house for a short walk. It's been 4 weeks since I shaved. or the first few days felt very uncomfortable. Did not want to show my head to my husband, parents and children. But after a few days feelings of discomfort go away. I am comfortable walking bald around the house and family. Did not try to do it in front of friends, but in time I think I'll be OK doing it. I still have a long chemo journey ahead of me. If I do all 12 taxol, I will be done by Sept 15. Here goes the entire summer 2008. I hope everyone is doing well. I see everyone keeps a positive attitude. I think this is the most important thing to be strong, positive, and concur bc once and for all. I wish you all the best. ",
