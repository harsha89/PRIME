I started to get this weird fatigue early on during radiation treatments, but it was uneven. As some have said, this is different than being weary. It feels like a white fog rising involving my brain and my eyes hurt. I'm about three weeks out from rads, and the fatigue starts mid-to-late morning and lasts into the evening. I have low-grade headache along with it. I'm not worried, but I do have a job communicating information clearly all day long and by mid-day I feel like my vocabulary has shrunk to a couple dozen words and my comprehension to around zero.  I'd love an estimate on when this is supposed to go away, even though logically I know that everyone is different.

(It also protects me when my kittens jump on my chest in bed ) MommyQ, your radiation treatment sounds so intricate and sophisticated. At some level, I find the technology fascinating. Are we lucky to be living in these times? I wonder how these innovations in treatment will be regarded in a generation or two.  MakeLemonade, you've been through so much! I've been spared the chemo that so many here have suffered and salute the fortitude you all show.   Your 'novel' is instructive. It is interesting to read about the variations in treatment and recommendations from our doctors. The more information I have the more 'empowered' I feel. I find myself humbled by all our stories, the hurdles, aches, pains, fearful challenges from our afflictions and sometimes from other parts of our lives. This forum is a place to air fears and woes and complaints, information and humor. This condition is my new obsession, and I feel stronger with this cyber community to turn to. ",

As each of my fellow sufferers 'graduated', I got them a card. I feel so fortunate to have gotten through so lightly, relatively speaking.  Jhodro, I was really fearing for my poor nipple, so sore already, when it came to the boosts, as they were centered on the excision point right around the areola, but oddly the soreness stopped when the boosts got underway. Maybe the boosts numbed it.  So, my experience of the rads: deep redness, some itching, sore nipple that eventually calmed, unpredictable periods of head-whacking fatigue. Frequent headaches, nothing I can't handle w/ aspirin or whatever's to hand. Still have fatigue and headaches, but I expect it. Worked through the treatments taking the occasional day off, sometimes needed to go home early. Occasionally I found that if I forced myself to walk around, I could get through my tiredness. Should of tried this more often, as my job can be stressful but sedentary. My very good wishes to everyone looking forward to getting out the other side!",

He also told me that despite the handout I was given permitting Tom's deoderant, he says best is straight cornstarch. MommyQ, do the blasts from the ten different directions go at the same time or sequentially? I'm also curious about what Genny has been told: 45 minutes and the interesting breathing thing. I'm interested in hearing more about this. Peggy, sounds like you're familiar with this? I'm thinking that MommyQ has a good idea with the 25 hours work a week. It probably works out to that for me in the end. I paid attention to the way the fatigue comes on: around four hours after rads I can feel it rising around me like fog, and my brain turns into oatmeal.

The aquaphor moistens, but what is the gel you mention? I'm beginning to be itchy as well. Could the gel help with this? Genny, Peggy, may I ask the reason for this breathing thing (you called it ABC)? Is this for your particular situation? Should all breast cancer people be doing this to avoid the heart and lungs? Peggy, I don't see IMRT on the abbreviation chart. I can guess what it stands for, but what do the letters really mean? golilly, lilyrose, I didn't notice redness until after @ 15 tx, and never had any burning. Your reactions sound like they should be specially examined? Or at least addressed/treated. Funny, at the beginning of the week, I looked ahead at the stretch of treatments ahead and they seemed exhausting and endless. Approaching Friday, and it feels like I'm marching along. They'll be over soon.  I have a pretty sedentary job, and when fatigue hits me, I know I'm going down. But today I had to go into the city for a meeting, and because it was a nice day I walked around 45 blocks or more (its very flat). The exercise pushed off the fatigue, and I felt sharper than I have at this time of day for a while. Maybe I'm on to something? I realize one instance is not a trend. Anyone here finish their rads yet? When does the brainfog/fatigue let up?",

I've tried counting the seconds of the actual radiation (there's a sound) and I get @ 25 seconds each, one on a side. I'm interested in MommyQ's \"10 different locations\". What is this type of treatment called? The radiation doesn't bother me much because I read so much I feel like I know what to expect.

Just six days out of surgery and three days home, I started noticing the corrugated texture of my skin, from under chin to waist to down both arms before I left the hospital. Felt like I was wearing an ugly itchy bumpy red sweater. The only spot untouched was where I had been irradiated. Pre-op, I told my surgeon about a similar experience after they removed the cancer, thought to have been from the antiseptic wash, but he did not seem fussed. Today during my first post op check, doc and his PA remarked on this unwanted 'garment'. Said I could use creams and pills, benadryl. They knock me out, but still itchy. Thinking about requesting something stronger, but concerned about adding MORE to the chemical soup. I had the idea the antiseptic was Betadine years back, but not sure. Doc says this time Chloraprep was used. Anyone had experience with this allergic reaction, any suggestions for relief, how long the rash takes to go away?",
