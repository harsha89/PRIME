It doesn't feel indented when I touch it although when the light shines on my breast in a certain way it is clearly visible. Almost like the outer edges are indented but the middle is not. My doctor did a breast exam and couldn't feel anything but has referred me to the breast clinic. I am so so so frightened. I cannot behave and live normally as i am beyond scareddd. Anyone had any simular symptoms? Or know how long l can expect to wait fOr my breast clinic exam? Thankypu Log in to post a reply",
