I begun the consultations for BRCA testing quite a long time ago (about 2 years?), but due to waiting lists, and putting things on ice whilst dealing with my Mum's death, I only had my final counselling session/blood sample submission yesterday. I've been told it could take up to 3 months for my results to come back (especially with Christmas and new year in the way), and am feeling really tense today, wondering about the results and feeling in limbo. I hope this tension eases up soon, or I'm going to be grey with worry before the 3 months is up! My main reason for wanting to post on here (and hoping that someone replies!) is that I don't know anyone else who has had this testing, or is in a similar situation, so I'm feeling a bit alone... I have good family and friends, but they have their own hectic lives, and I'd rather lean on people (and be there for them in return ;) ) who understand this from experience. So...anyone else out there waiting for results? Or already have their results (positive or negative) and want to share any tips/thoughts on coping with the emotional side of things? All of the threads I've looked at seem to be US-based - the UK's NHS have only just (last few months) started indirect BRSA testing, and my hospital have told me that I'm their first case, so I'm keen to hear from anyone (anywhere in the world!) who is sharing this experience.

How long were you told it would take for your results to come through? I'm expecting mine Feb/March. My brother is getting married in February, and he and my Dad have both said that if I get my results before the wedding, they'd like me to keep it to myself until after the wedding, which i'm having a bit of a hard time with (another reason for signing up to this forum). do you have good friends/family to lean on?",
