I'm going to go to a dermatologist and get him to check me all over, for skin cancer.  Skin cancer also runs in my family.  Dad, Uncle, Grandfather.  My husband just had a piece cut off his face.  I was a sun worshiper back in the day, but now I stay covered up or lots of sunscreen.    I really appreciate your reply's and information!   I hope the lady who first replied about her itchy breast is ok.  The whole waiting game was just awful for me and I really appreciate the people who set up this website .  It helped me so much!  I will stay in touch.

I went to a breast Clinic to have the test done.  My Gyno/Ob.  actually new nothing about the test.  He was hesitant.  Most people would do a MRI, or I guess the biopsy you were talking about in this situation, or sit and wait 6 months.  I didn't want to wait any longer!  The waiting and wondering drove me crazy.  I needed to know.  My insurance has a very high deductible(2500.00), so a MRI would have cost me too much.  BSGI only cost me 186.00.   I was hesitant about the BSGI test, since they inject you with a radioactive dye.  Look above and Nancy explained the test well.  After meeting her i decided to have the test.  When I was researching it on the Internet I didn't find anything neg. about it.   My micro-calcification's were spread out all over my breasts.  I don't think they gathered in one area.  I remember the Doctor at the Breast Clinic saying they couldn't do a biopsy on me, since none of the calcification's were clustered in one area.    They wanted to make sure nothing was in the dense breast tissue, since it's hard to see cancer in the dense tissue.  I'm not a doctor and I think I'm telling all of this info. correctly.  When I would go in the doctor's office I was pretty nervous, so I may be missing something.  Fulloflife:  If I were you I would ask your doctor about the test.  If they don't know anything about it, then I would research the Internet and try and find a Breast Clinic in your area who does the BSGI test.  The test is not painful!  If the test does show a suspicious area, then I believe you will need a biopsy after the test.  Nancy above did the biopsy shortly after the BSGI.  Good luck!   I hate to hear someone else going through what I did with the Mammograms.  I don't think my painful mammograms is in this post, but I have another post where I explained my terrible experience.  I think it's the tech. who makes it a terrible experience.  I've had 4 mammograms and only 1 was digital and 2 were fine and 2 were horrible.  I firmly believe its the technicians fault. When you scream and they say: Oh did that hurt!  They have no soul!  I've been through pain in my life and I'm not a baby or one who wines for no reason.  From now on I will have a conversation with all the tech. before the mammogram.  I had two tech. who were very caring people.   Anyway, enough about that.  Sorry, I get a little carried away when I start thinking about it.  Please keep getting tested don't wait.   Good luck!  Let me know if you can find a Breast Clinic in your area who does the BSGI.  Jodi",
