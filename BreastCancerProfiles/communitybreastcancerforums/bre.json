It will be a little uncomfortable to reach high.  I didn't need anything for pain except for tylenol.  The button down shirts with a pocket for drains is a great idea.  Remember to empty the drain every 8 hr at least so it doesn't clot off.  If it does then you have to milk it to get it working again.  After emptying mine, I folded it in half and then half again, put the stopper in, and let it go and it drained really well.  I didn't need any help with bathing after someone helped me wash the soaps and blood off my back after the surgery.  Didn't need any help with dressing.  I was driving in a week with a little discomfort and back to work in 2 weeks.  The small travel pillow worked really well for me and I still use it at night since there's no breast there to prop my arm on.  Silk jammies helped me to slide and move around easily.  I didn't have recon either.  Stairs should be no problem for you.  Hope this helps. ",

      "Content": "Mar 13, 2009 12:32AM - edited Mar 13, 2009 12:34AM by bre Hi Shadow,  My story is similar to yours.  Postponed my mammo for a few months because I thought I was too busy.  Beat myself up pretty bad for that which was counter productive.  Had no history of breast cancer in my family and never expected to.  I was diagnosed at 49.  Couldn't eat, sleep, etc while going through the diagnosis process.  Called to mammo center on Fri and ultrasound done, core biopsy on Tues., results in of breast cancer on Wed, saw breast surgeon same day after telling office people I couldn't eat, sleep, etc.  Mastectomy scheduled for Monday with skin sparing technique.  Didn't go for immediate recon because that would have delayed things for who knows how long to coordinate things.  Didn't have a choice about mastectomy because between the tumor and malignant microcalcifications, 3/4 of the breast was involved.  Pathology report after the mastectomy was a little different in the tumor size was smaller and it was not inflammatory bc like the biopsy suggested but was invasive ductal.  If you go for lumpectomy, ask if there will be a pathologist doing a frozen section at the surgery.  Then he can check immediately for clear margins while you are still asleep and they can get it all and no repeat surgeries. At first I felt like you and very upset.  Sure I would never see my sons marry, etc.  Five years later, I am doing great even though mine was a very aggressive cancer.  No signs of recurrence and working full time and doing whatever I want.  So what you are going through is no fun but it is doable.  Take deep breaths, keep as positive as you can, try to stay productively busy, and avoid negative people that will just absorb energy you don't have.  There are alot of great ladies here that will help you through all this.  Good luck with your appointment today.  Let us know what happens.",
