I bring my own supplies. and switched from my neighborhood corner nail place to a spa in a luxury hotel. that way...i know it's super clean. chemo screws with too much...i want to still have nice nails. ha. oh, the small things....",

I finished TC #2 last Wednesday. My best friend flew in from san fran (where she ironically is an oncology nurse) to take care of me, do my laundry, take my dog out, etc. WHAT A HELP! :) thanking my lucky stars for the amazing people who are in my life right now. i need to throw THEM a party when all this crap is done. ANYWHO, this time around they gave me emmend and aloxi. wow. what a difference. i felt a little funky for a few days but otherwise, 100 times better than the first. no joke. i live in chicago and today felt good enough to walk up and down michigan avenue a few times (well...and for retail therapy). so...it does get better, everybody.  hang in there! :) ",

TC every 3 weeks. i actually started April 28th (so i'm sneaking into your group! :) ) . i had a really rough go around. i am quasi hypersensitive to drugs (for example...i felt nauseous for 4 days after just my surgery alone!) so i knew that chemo would give me a run for my money. like some of you will have, i had a reaction to the taxotere almost immediately after it was started....i felt like my chest was thundering, couldn't get enough air, and i became hot all over (and bright red). my nurse was sitting with me in case this happened...and she was so in control. she stopped it, medicated me, and restarted it about 45 minutes later at slower rater. much better. i was also pretty nauseous for 5 days. despite all the anti-emetics. and the only thing that sounded good? potatoes! french fries, baked, soup, whatever! so...stock up! :)  and, finally, i already have some neuropathy and swelling in my hands and raised bumps on the palm-side of them. so they started me back on steroids for a few days...which has helped a ton! though..i still have tingling.  i was back to work (i'm a critical care nurse) one week after chemo. and i feel pretty darn good now. :) everyone says that the anticipation of the first chemo is the worst...but i think i'm more nervous about the 2nd since this first one was crap. we shall see. -Mary",
