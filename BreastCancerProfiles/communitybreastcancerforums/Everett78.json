If you went weekly would you be on steriods fulltime?  I take steriods the day before, day of chemo and two days after.  Fulltime steriods would drive me nuts. If they'd offered me the option of every two weeks I would have taken it, but weekly would be hard. Does your dr think the weekly dose would be more effective?
