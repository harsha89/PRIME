My treatment and history is in my signature. We have a bit in common so far. After the Tamoxifen stopped working (my numbers kept creeping up) a new scan showed a spot on the liver and more spread to more bones. Time for a change from Tamoxifen to Letrozole. Been on it for not quite 3 months and my numbers dropped 56 the first month and then 69 the second month. We are at 199 which is my lowest ever. Body aches are back with the change to Letrozole (Tamoxifen did that too, and eventually the aches went away; but so did the effectiveness of the drug.) So I look at it this way, I'll ache forever as long as the drug is working. Set for a new scan in late May, we'll know more then. Best of luck to you. ",

However, when drugs/treatment stop working, allow yourself to feel that panic and venerability. I think of it as a way to keep me in check as to what is really important in life. What to be mad about, what to appreciate, and what not to take for granted. A good cry does wonders, truly.    They are constantly finding new ways to treat our disease. And if WE keep sharing with each other things that we learn as patients (that the medical field doesn't share, or doesn't know) we will be here longer and longer.  Fortunately I am in a good spot right now. Letrozole in my drug of choice for now. Never seen my Oncologist come into the room SO happy! My body aches at places I didn't know would ache, but my numbers are down to 74!  My lowest ever. When it hurts to stand after sitting, I just think GO Letrozole, GO!  My scan last month showed less and less cancer, and many areas dormant. Sleep cells.. sleep...   I work really hard at my health with exercise and nutrition. I believe it pays off in the long run.  Also a thought to share that works for me. Very few people know that I have cancer. Family and a few close friends. I am fortunate enough to not have had chemo at this point. Thus, no \"visual\" evidence of hair loss that others would see. I chose this path as I want the privacy to deal with this in my own time and space. I feel VERY blessed to have this option, as I know many others do not have this choice.  By keeping my cancer to myself, the rest of the time to others I am just me. So each time I see someone I don't have to hear the \"how are you doing, how are you feeling\". Just trying to keep my life \"normal\" in a not so normal world that we all know.  Namaste to all.   ",

Truly \"normal\". I am taking an \"adrenal supplement\" (approved by my Oncologist) provided by my Chiropractor (who applies kinesiology for her treatment). It took my aches and pains for my bones and joints from an 8-9 down to a 2-3. Truly helped for me. Thought I would share with others. Last scan did not have anything to show. Got to skip the follow up Dr. appointment I am truly blessed. Namaste to all-",
