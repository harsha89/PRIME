I have decided that I have always wanted a short, cool rocker chick haircut, and too afraid to do it. I'm doing it now, got nothing to lose. The shedding is awful, I can tell you that. My daughter went thru chemo last year, and we had tumbleweeds all over the house. I think a super short 'do or a shave is the way to go. Glad that you joined up w/me!",

Once I could drink, I started drinking about 12 bottles of water a day. And I hate water! I found that if I put 1 in the freezer, once it starts to freeze, I guzzle it. The cold tastes so good. So I constantly have a rotation going. Thanks for the heads up on blow drying my hair. I still have it, and have been only washing about 2 times a week. Will air dry from now on. Maybe that'll help.

Now that I'm checking, it seems as tho I'm eating better. Also trying to get on the treadmill everyday (too cold here for outdoor walking). So far, feeling pretty good after tx on Tues. (it was no.3). glad you have help too! Not happy with chance of cholesterol going up on Taxol. It's already climbing and getting pretty high. Oh well, just another hurdle to jump. Good thing I ran track in high school! AbqTiger, wow, a dance class! That sounds like so much fun!! Tappy, congrats on being done w/the red devil...I'm right behind you! Hoping all is well w/Malinda also. You're all in my thoughts. Always.",

I am to have a follow up surgery this Wed. on my mx. They did a skin sparing, but the skin is not viable, so I'm not healing. Still on restriction, and still have a drain. Boo! PS says this will put me on track. I sure hope so. Welcome cfdr! My mood swings have been ok, but I am tired and sleep a lot. Healing or depression? Not sure! I am having 4XAC and 4XTAX I go every two weeks. That's followed by the 5 yr. tamoxifen plan. For you and Surreygirl, what chemo class did you guys get? Nobody has said anything about a class or a bag. Here's to another week girls, and a week closer to being cancer free!",

Chest x-rays clear, bone scan clear (except for the nasty arthritis in my knees), blood work good (a bit anemic tho), ultrasound on abdomen showed all organs functioning the way they should, and the echo on my heart showed very good chamber and valve function. The septum is not as active as it should be, so we will keep a close eye on it. I think my lunch and the drugs have caught up with me.

I cut mine off yesterday and I don't know if I'll ever get used to it. I wanted to donate it, so I was perhaps a bit early in getting rid of it. Good luck with yours and your feelings about it. cfdr=glad to hear you're tolerating the tx ok so far. Yipee And as far as I'm concerned, with what we're all dealing with...there can never be TMI Carla=you sound like you're doing great and I have to say Thank You for the hope that I will also be drinking my fave DIET COKE in the future. I was starting to get worried. Here's to a restful night to all of us one way or the other!",

She was dx last Feb. and the 71 bags of chemo, yes 71, fought off the leukemia, yet she's at risk for developing other forms of cancer. She is still on 3 different chemos orally every day, but only has another year of that! She didn't want to have fun w/her wigs, she just wanted to look like her. I'm all about trying something new!",

I think cutting it really helped with the emotional part of it. Always had long hair and it was kinda liberating after cutting it. Ossa, I think your hair looks cute. I'm sooo ready for mine to be full enough I can go topless. I don't mind how short it is, I just want it to be full. Thanks for all the coloring tips, can't wait to be able to try them!",
