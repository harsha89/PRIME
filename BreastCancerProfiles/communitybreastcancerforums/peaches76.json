      "Content": "peaches76 wrote: Hi everyone. I'm 41 and went for my routine mammo/us and was called back because of changes from my baseline mammo last year. Had diagnostic mammo and us on Friday. I don't have the report but my dr said they saw a sub cm spiculated area (that's bad right?), bi rads 4, upper left, closer to chest wall. The ultrasound didn't see any abnormalities, and they were working on me with the ultrasound forever trying to see something. Because they can't see it on the us I have to get the mammo guided biopsy. I called to schedule my apt but they said they have a co-ordinator that handles it and i will get a call in 2-3 days to schedule. I am an anxious person and I just want to get this all done before my mind makes me completely crazy. My best friend died of bc this year at 41 after 10 year battle, and I can't stop thinking of everything she endured. I'm a wreck and am having a hard time thinking of anything else. :( Log in to post a reply",

It was not the most fun experience as they had a hard time viewing the suspicious area with the machine so they had to go back to the 3d to locate it, etc. The dr would not speculate on results but said I should hear from them by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Now that the biopsy is over though,i already feel more calm. Thanks again for the kind words and hope the best for you too.",
