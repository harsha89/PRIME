    "Content": "Redheada wrote: Just curious because I had always heard that if you have pain associated with lumps or inflammation then it isnt cancer.  I am 40 with a history (mom and paternal grandmother both diagnosed in mid-40s).  I just had my annual mammo which was clear.  I will say about 3-4 months ago I kept feeling my left breast was larger than normal.  Really felt it when I would put my bra on.  Now - this past weekend I suddenly felt pain on the side of the same breast.  My breast are very lumpy normally so sometimes it is a challenge to distinguish but I definitely felt something.  Not necessarily on the surface but underneath some of my breast tissue and it is definitely sore.  Saw my OB/GYN today and she ordered an MRI- I am waiting to set up an appt.   I was curious if anyone out there has had similar symptoms and with the pain did it turn out to be BC.  I feel I might be a little paranoid because of my mom - but I am noticing changes so better safe than sorry.  Log in to post a reply",
