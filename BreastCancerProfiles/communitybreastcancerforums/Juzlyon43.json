I have been homeschooling my children the last 7 years and had my own business. Letting go of that person has been the hardest. My youngest is 9 and I lost my mom to breast cancer when she was 6 months old. I was thankful my mother was here when she was born. She is named after my mother too. Trying to convince my children that I will survive losing my mom has been hard. I am younger and treatments are better now. That is what I keep telling myself. I have searched and read on these blogs to keep my hope alive. I will add you to my prayers and your children too.",

This is my first post because When I had read other post on this blog I have only seen or found probably because of the chemo brain those with early stage ? Somehow today I found others with similar stories. I was assuming that similar cases were fatal. I am embarrassed to type that I don't know all my diagnosis because it is so overwhelming. I thought I understood until looking on here there is much more to my stage3. I plan on getting the copies and understanding more. I moved my treatment to MD Anderson in December after 6 TCH treatments before surgery. I do know that I am HER2 my tumor was 5cm . I had surgery in Jan left side mastectomy only my lymph nodes were 8/20 which is what I found scary. It only showed 1 or 2 lymphs involved on my scan. I did have good response to the chemo before surgery the tumor was reduced but there were more lymph nodes than expected. Trying to figure it all out at the beginning is difficult and especially when others around you don't have your stage and type. My dr. Was encouraging and patient trying to explain the her2 but there seems to be so many variations it is hard to understand at least for me.",
