I can't imagine dealing with the pain of having a child in surgery. As mothers, we would rather have the pain ourselves. It's an awful feeling, I know, to be out of control of how our babies feel. But it sounds like the worst is behind you, and he'll be up and at 'em in no time! As for the blessed with cancer thing--I agree with Katie. I am a better person, there are things in my life (ie my church, my adopted daughter, Shelli, all of YOU) that wouldn't be here if not for my diagnosis. So I kind of understand where the women on the panel were going, but honestly, \"blessed\" really was a poor choice of words. I certainly don't feel blessed when I go for treatments every three week, and when I live my life three months at a time between scans. Am I better for it? probably. But I'd be \"blessed\" if it'd never happened! I hope you can put this hellish week behind you, and get on to happier times now. I'm so sorry you have had a poopy week, but it can only get better from here. Love, Geeta",

I wanted you all to be able to read the beautiful words written for her. Also, Kimmy posted the number of a florist in Canton that will take orders for pink carnations until 10:30 eastern time tomorrow, Friday the 21st. Here is that number (thanks Kimmy--great talking to you). (330)453-0183 Shelli Kay (Hunter) Schwenk  Shelli Kay (Hunter) Schwenk Shelli Kay (Hunter) Schwenk Born November 5, 1968. Shelli passed away at home Wednesday, September 19, 2007. She will be deeply missed by the love of her life, husband Karl Schwenk, and her beautiful children: Hunter (10), Karalyn (6) and Olivia (5); parents, Stan and Sandy Hunter; father and mother-in-law, Karl and Donna Schwenk; sisters Traci (Steve) Libby, Lori (Jason) Dossi; and sister and brother-in-law Karen and Charlie Johnson. Her memory will be cherished by aunts and uncles, Barbara and Scott Brady, Debbie and Tom Beiter, Jerry and Vicky Ramsier, Gary and Joyce Hunter, Bob and Bonnie Hunter; nieces and nephews Taylor and Brianna Libby and Matthew and Leah Johnson; and countless cousins, family friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was preceded in death by her maternal grandparents, Leu and Pearl Ramsier; paternal grandparents, Clair and Helen Hunter; and uncle \"Butch\" Ramsier. Shelli was born in Canton, Ohio, and graduated from Lake High School in 1986. She was part of Leonard Insurance Services for 16 years, where she began as a Customer Service Rep. Shelli's spunky attitude and professionalism enabled her to become one of the first women appointed to the title of Vice President at the Leonard Agency, an accomplishment of which she was very proud. Shelli was an amazing cook and baker - her pumpkin rolls were coveted gifts for the lucky few recipients at holiday time. She and Karl enjoyed cooking together, and appreciated good food and wine. She loved to travel, and often spoke of a special trip to Europe that she and Karl made together, summer beach vacations with family, island getaways with high school buddies - and most recently a dream Disney cruise with her entire family. Through her business and personal relationships Shelli touched positively the lives of many people. This became especially true after she was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago. Her selfless attitude, and the classy way with which she handled herself gave hope and encouragement to others. And for this, she will always be remembered. Private services for the family will be conducted on Friday with Rev. David Wright officiating. Visitation for the public will be held on Friday, September 21, 2007, in the REED FUNERAL HOME NORTH CANTON CHAPEL, 801 PITTSBURG AVE. from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Aultman Hospice and Palliative Care, 2821 Woodlawn NW, Canton 44708.

I am pretty much MIA from the boards for months at a time, but I just happened to pop in today and saw your post. My elbow began hurting, felt like I had cracked it up against a wall, and was very bruised feeling to the touch. My onc thought it was tendonitis, nothing to be concerned about, but we went through the scans to verify--had an xray, mri, ct, and finally a bone biopsy. That is when it was determined that I did indeed have mets.  Nowhere else in the bones, just my elbow! I do, incidentally, also have lung mets. The xray showed nothing, and my bloodwork has always been normal. The only 100% definite test was the CT guided bone biopsy. Hurt like hell, but it was at least the answer I needed (although not at all the one I wanted) When I received radiation to the site, my radiation onc at the Cleveland Clinic said she had never treated an elbow before. So while rare, it is possible. BUT--that said, with your prior elbow issues, I'm certain it truly is nothing. But please get every scan under the sun until it is determined beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is NOTHING to worry about, ok? Good luck to you, I'll keep you in my prayers. Pam--you are the only other person I've ever heard of with elbow mets! And I thought I was the only goofed up one out there...  :) Hugs, Geeta",

So I'm relishing in the moment, at least until January when I am due for more scans. I keep in touch still with Sandy (Shelli's mom), and actually had a lunch date scheduled with her last week, but she came down with a horrible cold, and it was snowing pretty steadily all day, so we had to cancel. But she still peeks on you guys every now and then to see how you are. You have all become a part of her as well. Just wanted to let you know. Again, thank you thank you thank you for thinking of me. I'm loving life right now, and am trying to hang on to that for as long as I can. I love you all very much!!!! If I don't pop in again soon, have a wonderful, fabulous, happy, joyous, laughter filled, obnoxiously Merry Christmas!!!! Please take care of yourselves, ok? Love and great big hugs, Geeta",

Had you told her that you have stage 4 cancer, I'm sure she would have been singing another tune! I probably would have told her about my disability, and added that what's creepy is that she's been watching you for a week....  :) I know it's easier said than done, but don't let her ruin another day. Just chalk it up to ignorance. And unfortunately, you can't always tell by looking at someone that they are sick, or disabled. Take it as a compliment!! You look marvelous!!

You know, it honestly only took me a couple of weeks to feel better about my mets--but it is most likely because I had suspected mets for about 7 months prior to diagnosis. I have lung and bone mets, and during routine scans, tiny spots were found on my lungs, too small to biopsy, or radiate--measured in milimeters, not centimeters. They weren't sure if they were mets, or fighting an infection, or scarring--so we just waited, but I think I knew. Then when I lost mobility in my right arm, a bone biopsy confirmed bone mets, and we've confirmed the lung since. So I guess I was happily in denial land for a few months, but had a bit of time to get used to it. Once it was confirmed that I was metastatic, it was a couple weeks of BLECH before I put on my boxing gloves again. And I'm really and truly ok now. I have my moments, but even completely healthy people have times when they want to scream ENOUGH ALREADY!! It's not easy, but you really can get your life back. I hate that you are so down, but I know that you can do this! You can pull out of this sorrow--but give it time. And don't you dare ever feel guilty about being depressed. You're entitled! Also--if you feel that you need it, many, many, many women here have been on anti-depressants, especially around the time of diagnosis. It's a difficult time that no one should have to face, but there are medications that can help you if you need them. Just a thought. Keep us posted on how you are. The emotional side of this disease is just as hard as the physical. Love, Geeta PS--Badboob--I LOOOOVE it!! SCANIC!! I'll have to use that one....",

Of COURSE it matters where the cancer is--it matters to YOU, and damn it, that's ALL that matters!!!! I could just shake him..... My onc typically relies on my scans, we do a PET and CAT every three months, and occasionally an MRI if needed. The CAT shows any new masses, or growths, and the PET shows new cellular activity, even if it hasn't formed a tumor and shown up on the CAT. My meds were switched last scan because, even though the CAT showed no change, a couple of new areas of increased metabolic activity lit up on the PET. So we figured we'd nip it in the bud quickly. I don't have my tumor markers relayed to me. I guess if they skyrocketed it would be brought to my attention, but truly I have no desire to see them. I guess it's because they can change so often, and aren't really terribly accurate all the time. But my scans are pretty well right on. I really want you to consider getting a different onc. I STRONGLY dislike the way you are being treated. You do not deserve to be blown off, treated poorly, and left in the dark. Everything should be explained to you in terms you can understand!!! I really, really want to shake him---hard. Ask these questions point blank to your onc. And then take these same questions, with all of your medical records/scans, to another onc that will treat you like you deserve to be treated. Good luck, sweetie. Love, Geeta PS By the way, NO question is a silly question!!!",
