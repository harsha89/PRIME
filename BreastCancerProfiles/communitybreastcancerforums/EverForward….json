I am approaching the one year anniversary of my first chemo; I was part of the \"Starting Chemo in April 2014\" board. As my \"chemo-versary\" approaches, I've been thinking about what I would say if I could write a letter to myself as I was starting chemo. The next best thing is to write a letter to you ladies who are starting chemo this month. So here goes. Rely on the ladies on this forum. They will become your sisters. This will be the safe place where you can vent, cry, scream, or pout without guilt or judgment. I have wonderful friends and family who supported me during chemo, but there is no substitute for having comrades who are going through it with you. I could not have made it through without my April chemo sisters; we're planning an in-person get together in the fall. Chemo sucks. It will do all kinds of crazy things to your body, mind, and spirit. There will be good days and bad days. And then eventually the bad days will outnumber the good days and the good days won't be all that good. When you're at your lowest and feel like sh*t, it's okay to curl up in bed and do nothing. You don't have to be strong all the time. There is life on the other side of chemo and whatever other treatments you may have. I am 7 months PFC, 6 months post BMX, and 3 months post exchange surgery. I joined a gym a month ago and have been taking Zumba, yoga, and barre classes every week religiously. It's not pretty, but I feel myself getting stronger every day. I'm able to sleep through the night again. My hair is growing, although much too slowly (thanks to the ongoing Herceptin infusions). There is life after chemo! I know these words won't alleviate the pain and suffering that chemo can cause. But when you inevitably find yourself in the dark place, I hope they will help you to not give up hope that it will get better. I wish you an uneventful treatment with no complications!",

I haven't been able to go out much or travel since my diagnosis (and my birthday fell on a bad chemo day), so I decided to cram a lot of pampering and enjoyment into one holiday weekend. Having almost reached the annual out-of-pocket maximum of my health insurance, I celebrated by spending an OBSCENE amount of money on myself at a nice resort and spa about an hour outside of DC. I left the wig at home, but took several nice scarves with me. When I was getting ready for my spa treatment, I hesitated about leaving the scarf in the locker and walking around the spa area bald. I haven't let anyone see me like that. But I left the scarf behind. When I was sitting in the relaxation room waiting for my treatment, a bald woman walked by. We gave each other a knowing smile. It was perfect. I saw her later in the restaurant, still bald, having a nice time with some friends.  This was the first time since my diagnosis that I haven't felt like Cancer Girl. I didn't talk about cancer at all this weekend! ",

So there's hope that chemo doesn't have to be a horrible experience. Good luck everyone going in for your first or second round!

After putting my life on hold to spend a year working in Afghanistan, I arrived in DC last September looking forward to living in the States again and enjoying a nice quality of life. But not long after I unpacked, I was diagnosed and had to put my life on hold - again. How many special occasions and fun events have we missed or not truly enjoyed because we can't travel, or we're in too much pain, or are too tired? It sucks. I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again. Count me in for hot flashes and no eyebrows. My eyelashes are hanging on for now. I have an icky taste in my mouth most of the time. Final round is next week. Every time I think about my last chemo I practically burst into tears. As much as I hate being physically fragile, I hate being emotionally fragile even more.  I had consultations with the breast surgeon and plastic surgeon today in advance of my mastectomy in September. I LOVE my new breast surgeon. She is a BC survivor and used the same plastic surgeon for her own reconstruction. That's a pretty good vote of confidence, right? ",

But compared to how *miserable* I would be if they had to use only the veins in one arm for an entire year (chemo + Herceptin), the port is a lifesaver. If you are very worried about it and were only doing a few rounds of chemo, I might advise against it. But if you have tricky veins and are doing a year of treatment, IMO, it's totally worth getting a port.",

I still have to go back for the Herceptin every few weeks until April so I'll make a bigger ruckus with the gong then. I was feeling pretty good by the evening so I walked around the corner (overruling the muscle fatigue) to treat myself to dinner and a decadent dessert while my taste buds and digestive system don't object. I was wearing a scarf without the wig and I noticed a family at the next table glancing over my way. When they got up to leave, the father made a u turn toward my table and said, \"I wish you well. I had prostate cancer.\" I thanked him and almost started crying again. Now all I have to do is get through the next 9 days until I get on a plane to CA, aka a little slice of heaven.",

I arrived in CA  9 days PFC and after a few days with family near LA, I came up to my cabin in Big Bear - my happy place. It's wonderful here, but the high altitude makes even more winded! A gentle stroll along a mostly flat bike path along the lake wore me out and killed my glut muscles. I've been forcing myself to do chores around the house (I planted rose bushes yesterday) but for every 2 minutes of exertion, I have to spend a few more minutes catching my breath.  It's nice to know that I'm not the only one dealing with this. No chores this afternoon, just sitting around watching the birds and chipmunks. ",

I'm sure that will help; if nothing else, I'll be able to take a shower and that usually makes me feel better. I think I had 50 ccs and 100 ccs put in at the surgery.

Oddly, even though I felt the tightness a couple hours later, I think the fill actually relieved some of my discomfort - like the sensation of someone pinching my armpit.  It's amazing how quickly my mood and attitude can change. Looking back over the past year, a psychologist would probably have a field day with the inner dialogues that I've had with myself since my diagnosis. They kinda went like this: \"This sucks. I don't want to have cancer and I don't want to deal with surgeries and chemo and reconstruction.\" \"But you're a tough chick and you can do this. You're strong.\" \"No I'm not.\" \"Yes you are.\" \"Just shut up.\" \"You shut up! You've got this thing licked. You'll come out of this even better and stronger than you were before.\" \"All I want to do is lay on the couch, binge watch an entire season of The Walking Dead, and eat ice cream all day.\" \"Fine, you can have your pity party today, but then tomorrow you have to bathe, get dressed, and go outside. Buy something at the farmer's market and make yourself something healthy to eat.\" \"Ok, fine.\"",

In any case, if anyone ever makes it to DC, I hope you'll let me know. My MO gave me a presecription for Tamoxefin, now that I've recovered sufficiently from my BMX surgery. I can't seem to bring myself to start taking them. It just feels so permanent. Surgeries have a clear end state. Same thing with the chemo. But taking hormone pills for 10 years, something about that scares me. It's like a daily reminder that it could still come back. It's completely irrational, and I'm the most rational person I know!",
