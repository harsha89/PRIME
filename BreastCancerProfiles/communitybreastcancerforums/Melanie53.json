She was 28 years old and living in Larkspur when she was diagnosed with breast cancer back in '81. She and I both lived in several different places in Marin. KEW, I lived in Tiburon and Novato, too. I'm sorry about your mother, and also about your diagnosis. I moved away from the Bay Area in December '01 and was living in Arizona when I was diagnosed with DCIS in March of '07. I had spend most of the years between 1974 and 2001 living in the Bay Area. I miss it. I often wonder, though, what causes the high numbers of breast cancer in Marin.",
