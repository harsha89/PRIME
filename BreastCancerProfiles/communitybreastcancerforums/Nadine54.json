Hugs to all, Nadine",

She is like the rest of us researching all of the time.  Poor girl don't know how she works, takes care of a family and still has time to do anything else.  But you know like she told me last night, knowledge is a good thing.  I thought I had seen every site there was and she keeps finding more and all are interesting and informative.  I will try and make a list of many sites and post later.  One of the things which is nice about the net is that I can use the webcam and model hats, wigs and such for her.  She told me I seem to be in better spirits.  Pretty funny in a way when modeling hats and such for the no hair day is actually fun.  With the big day coming up she keeps me laughing...we have plenty of deep conversations.  I am finding my husbsand doesn't say much but listens to me.  I try really hard not to talk all of the time about the treatments, that what if's, the what to do's and so on.  As the days get closer to April 1st start date, I see an increased sadness and pain in his eyes.  Yesterday when we picked up the package of hats there was a letter enclosed, this is part of that letter: \"All of our volunteers here at Heavenly Hats wish you and your loved ones the best and please know that you are in our thoughts and prayers.  May these hats be a small symbol of hope for you through your journey\".  I was reading this to him and I got where I was having a hard time talking and the tears wanted to flow...Like I told hubby, we are in it together. Us as the patients, our families also.  We go down this path hand in hand and hope for the best.  I am lucky to have a husband who wants and is active in every part of this starting with that first visit to one doctor and the wide range of other doctors etc.  Sometimes as we all know I feel alone.  But I try hard to make sure he knows how I feel and when I just want to ramble.  We have a strong marriage and it seems all of this has brought us even closer.  I get tired real easy still and he is so helpful in doing laundry, cooking and such.  There is no way to take away his fears, sadness or anything however the one thing I am aware of is love those whom we love like we never have.  I am learning patience within myself and with others.  Yup there are those moments when I shake bad and I get pretty pissed, but for me venting and then letting that moment go is helping.  I have done a ton of additional research on the chemo drugs that will be used for me, I am fully aware that I won't be one of the ones who will have the easy side effects.  But no matter I am marching forward and knowing it will pass.  I started already the better eating habits, drinking tons more good fluids.  May not feel like eating in a short bit so trying to make sure the body is as healthy as possible before I start and with luck that will help.  We figure we can't prepare for everything but I think we are as much under control as we can be for now.  Pretty much wait and see and then we will know what will be needed as it comes.  Like I told hubby I refuse to turn our home into a hospital.  Well my friends, hope you are all doing well.  And know you are all in my thoughts and prayers also.  Keep smiling and laughing.",

So last night I feel asleep on the couch and told hubby first of all if I am sleeping don't wake me...period.  Well after many small cat naps I went on to bed.  Hubby stays up late doing his own computer thing.  I don't think he was in bed 5 minutes when the up and down started all night long again.  The sleeping pills work but darn they need to work longer like a full nights sleep.  OH and the fun part about everything is I ended up with mouth yuk, what ever in the world they call it.  I have been doing everything to a \"T\" then that crap hits me.  Coffee tastes like pond water right now.  Just one cup would be so nice. I am going to turn into a fish with all of the fluids I think...well maybe not but I sure spend enough time in the bathroom anyway.  So now with new sleep meds, heartburn meds, meds for near everything I think I am set.  LETS HOPE!  I did ask the doc about the so called honeymoon time, he told me it will come....my thinking is let it be all next week before I return for round #2 on the 22nd of April.  So girls, the head started to tingle last night.  I thought all day about could this be the time to shave it off.  Yup by this afternoon several places on my head was driving me nuts....gee I thought I had already been there done that.  Seriously, we shaved my head.  I cried like a baby at first, took two anxiety meds first, closed my eyes and told hubby lets do it.  So the hair is gone and he did a great job.  Weird to shower without hair, and the towel wouldn't stay on my head...no hair.  Overall I am doing pretty good.  Hating water and so much fluids, but know its a must.  And wishing and dreaming of when my hair grows back.  They say it comes back thicker and more beautiful...works for me. They also say more curls, I'll pass on more curls for a while. Hope everyone is keeping their chin up.  We will get through this.  When things seem really rough I tell myself it could be worse.  How quickly I change my thinking into more positive thoughts like warm weather, flowers, grandchildren, riding my motorcycles and just living each day to the fullest. Hugs to everyone! Nadine",

Loosing my hair was the hardest thing...once it was gone...no more trying to figure out how to disguise the years of thinning anymore.  I felt strongly and as hard as it was to say \"buzz it off\", that was my control over something.  My life was turned upside down in a couple of weeks...lost a boob...felt like a freak for a spell...got over that emotion and dealing with the fact I had lost a boob and that was okay because I was alive...then now your going to give me drugs to kill any cancer cells left and I get to loose my hair and be sick....again..again...what a deal I felt...NOT!  I often talk of one of my daughters in Washington State who has done so many chemo treatments, radiation and barometric treatments and some of the discussions she and I have had over the effects and yup hair loss was and continues to be a big one we still talk about.  Yesterday she and I talked again for several hours long distance about hair.  Her hair was long, butt length and I thought always so beautiful, her hair was who she was.  WRONG!  She told me yesterday her \"new\" hair is yes short and growing, but its thick, soft and beautiful.  I told her that her hair was always beautiful before.  This daughter is days short of turning 35 and she told me no matter what she loves her new hair and it is the one thing that she can say was worth all of her treatments and continued fight on her type of cancer.  We talked and laughed because little did I realize her hair was also thin on top and she was good and fixing it and not letting even her own mother know.  I told her the wigs have just to much hair...we laughed and laughed.  Girls, our hair is us...its only hair...easy to say??? Nope!  But you know I wanted wigs with long hair, I decided on mid to short wigs.  My wigs were free with the Cancer Center I am a patient with.  Damn that hurt a bit, \"PATIENT\", I am not a bit patient...need to change that word for sure.  I was going to spend what ever it took to find the perfect wig.  My feelings were why spend money on something that I may not wear much and for sure once my own hair comes back probably never again.  I love the outdoors..you know all of the stuff...riding motorcycles...can you imagine a wig flying off going down the road?  NOT!  ATV's would be a problem since I love the mountains and climbing hills and trails...constant dirt in the wig...NOT!  Other things like fishing and hunting...man what a bad thought of terrible hair days there...cast the fishing pole and poof goes the wig in the water.  Its just hair girls, do what is right for you.  Buzzing my head took care of the mess of waiting for the hair to fall out in clumps...took care of those weird headaches.  Coming from a long line of cancers in my family I have seen more members without hair than I care to remember, each had their issues with hair loss...each dealt with it in their own way...each had new growth thicker and more beautiful than before.  I would be happy to respond to PM's on this hair topic (of course any topic).  Girls, remember we are the backbone of our families...no matter what you choose to do it has to be your decision and yours alone.  Nadine",

Glad everyone is getting into the buzz.  Sure is liberating.  But keep in mind the hair still will come on out of the follicles.  Mine has been working on getting on out for a few days...little pain but looks more like a porky pine, and rough. Tried everything and finally decided to get smart and now after some great advice on this forum, my head feels so much better and not so patchy.  SE's aren't to bad this time but now diarrhea has set in.  Last time when this happened the effects of the Nuelasta shot kicked in the same time with severe bone and muscle craps while trying to go to the bathroom...Man did I have the toilet and floor rocking while in pain and trying to do my bathroom duty...sure hope it doesn't happen this way again.  Over all just tired, seems when you want to nap, folks come over or neighbors decide to mow there lawns back and forth back and forth...ever wonder how many swipes it really takes to mow a lawn.  When I get the energy to do that again I am sure going to think about it a little more. Hope everyone is doing okay.  My list got so long on ones I was concerned about...ports, SE's...you are all on my mind.  Hope the weekend gets better for everyone...I thought today was Saturday.  Hubby told me nope its Sunday...man where are the days going.  Last treatment I was feeling somewhat better by Wednesday so looking forward to Wednesday coming up and hope things are back in the slow climb to the \"honeymoon phase\".  Lots of hugs and love to everyone...Keep smiling...we are getting through this together...step by step.

Hubby got me another leather jacket...now hope it stays cool so I can wear it.  Can't ride my motorcycles yet and doubt my helmet will fit with no hair anyways.  Guess there won't be any riding this year without a helmet. Idaho is a state that doesn't require helmets if your over 18.  Decided once chemo is over and the SE's and meds are done then I am going to ride a short ride just to feel alive again.  Smoking is top of my list of things to quit once the treatments are over.  Doc says to wait on quiting for now...something new having a doc tell you that. Got my mind already for quit day.  And since I shake so much little blush, eye brow pencil and some eye shadow is about all I can muster on good days.  Going to do the works on make-up as the hair grows back.  Decided when all is done I am going to look as healthy as I can.  Been sick and tired of being sick and tired to long...yup my \"good days have started\" so I am feeling spunky again...low in energy and still napping once a day and still loving being able to see clearly.  Brain is slowly waking up!  Hoping to go do some shopping tomorrow if hubby is off.  I hate shopping but its an excuse to drive an hour away to a larger town and get out!  Sending good thoughts to everyone!  Keep smiling and keep your chins up...we are getting through this.

I can now really smile and know chemo is over and done.  I remember reading postings early on of others who had finished and thinking I would never be on the other side.  It does happen...hang in there and keep getting the treatments.  Its not a cake walk but it shall pass.  Wishing everyone mild SE's and looking forward to you joining the group of cancer survivors.

Shannon56:  My DH is a recovering alcoholic.  I understand one sip is all it takes.  You sound like one strong lady and I know you are going to be fine.  Early on my fear was my DH would just take that sip to calm his nerves...standing by watching me have SE's and then top it with my fears.  In our house you would wonder who is really the person drinking for the cause...fluids and fluids and more fluids.  I do the juice, water, and all of the good stuff...maybe one soda a week.  DH, drinks enough OJ and Lemonade to sink a ship.  I hope you have all of the support you need at home.  Life is a struggle as we all know.  And my dear friend, always know you can turn to us here.  We support, understand and do love each other.  We have a strong sisterhood and we can work through anything.  Will be thinking of you each day!  You are a fighter, I can see that...so FIGHT!  We all have those moments of, \"WTF\" but fight and get mad.  The other day DH was home and he probably figured I had really went off the deep end.  I was trying to do a quick vacuum on the carpets.  All of a sudden, I turned off the vacuum and screamed.  Yup, a deep down, loud, cussing scream.  He came out of our computer room and looked at me like maybe he should call the men with the straight jacket.  I just smiled and told him I was fine, I was just needing to vent.  He looked like he didn't know if he should laugh or run.  Yup the neighbors probably figured I had finally went nuts.  NOPE I vented and then felt fine.  This damn cancer may kick me down, may make me sick with SE's, may make me depressed at times....BUT I will conquer! As far as how I am doing....had terrible knee pain for several nights.  Nothing worked to releave the pain.  I found if I wear shoes during the day and not just slippers or socks the pain is less.  Over all my SE's haven't been to bad this time, just seem to linger.  I am finding my \"honeymoon phase\" is taking longer to get here this time.  I am back to having problems with staying asleep at night....going to talk to the doc on that.  I go right to sleep then wake up a few hours later for the trot to the bathroom every hour.  Ever wonder how in the world a person can go to the bathroom so much?!?!  My main problem has been excessive mucus this time and meds aren't helping much, also continue to use OCEAN for the moisturizer part...huge clots followed by nose bleeds...not to bad just uncomfortable and getting pretty old. NO mouth thrush this time thanks to the meds...hate meds by the handful's but sure nice when they do their job! Hope everyone is chilling this weekend.  And Anna, thanks for jaring me into remembering I hadn't checked in for a while...do read the forum several times a day...need my forum fix! OOPS>>>been wondering on my hair....well lack of...will it be more gray, thick, straight or curly again.  After my shower last night I told DH to smell my head....got to love those DH's who will do anything to make us smile...he came over and sniffed my head.  I told him, \"smells good doesn't it\"?  He smiled and told me it smells clean...I used Strawberry shampoo, and he couldn't smell it...and when he gave the sniff, he shocked my head!  What a weird sick joke, but now we are on the, \"WANNA SMELL MY HEAD\".  Oh well flipping back to the forum and wishing the sun would shine...way to dark today.  Have a wonderful day and remember to find humor even in the craziest of things...(yup the brain is flipping today but doing A-OK) Nadine",

Anyone watch, \"Wife Swap\" the other night?  I have a word for the fur wearing woman.  My favorite show is \"Survivor\".

Yesterday was wonderful...worked in the yard, just kept busy all day.  Got to remember to wear sunscreen from now on.  Wore shorts, tank top and sandals...must have changed my hat 5 times.  Wore hats that would keep the sun of of my face and neck for sure. My hair is now shooting out of the follicles.  Got a few more smooth spots...figure in a couple of days there will be no hair left on the head.   Told hubby last night I was going to take a shower and shave, and do my hair...poor  man looked at me like I had went nuts.  He didn't know if he should laugh or what so he just looked at me...I finally after a few seconds told him that I guess the showers will be fast now for a while.  Decided today to wear my new BC tank top and new hat to chemo today...was going to wear sandals because my feet are swelling due to the heat...wearing socks and shoes and will take the sandals. ",

      "Content": "May 4, 2009 08:17AM - edited May 4, 2009 08:17AM by Nadine54 On the topic of sex or no sex:  I finally broke down and pulled out one of the many books my Onc gave to us.  Didn't want to be reading \"Sexuality and Cancer\".  (For the woman who has cancer and her partner).This book is published by the American Cancer Society.  I encourage everyone who has additional questions to see if you can pick up a copy at your treatment center. On EFFECTS OF CANCER TREATMENT ON FEMALE SEXUAL DESIRE AND RESPONSE:  It states: \" At first, concern for survival is so great that sex is far down the list of needs to be met.  This is quite normal.  Few people are interested in sex when they feel their life is being threatened.  When people are in treatment, loss of desire may result from worry and depression, nausea, pain and fatigue.  Cancer treatments that disturb the hormone balance can also lessen sexual desire.  If there is a conflict in the relationship, one partner or both might lose interest in sex.  Any emotion or thought that keeps a woman from feeling excited can interfere with desire for sex.  Distracting thoughts can keep her from getting aroused.  her vagina then stays tight and dry, making intercourse somewhat painful.  Many people who have cancer worry that a partner will be turned off by changes in their bodies by the very word \"cancer\" . THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE BOOK It continues to say having sex during chemo is safe...and also says generally few days before the next chemo there is a normal interest in sexual activity.  It also says it may not be the normal that many would have known before all of the surgeries and chemo treatments.  It does address radiation and other forms of cancer in different parts of the body.  The book is 80 pages long.  The book is right to the point and tells it like it is.  In my house, I told DH the other evening that I had no sexual desire.  I was tactful of course.  He told me he felt that he wouldn't say or do anything and take the direction from me.  I was worried that he may feel unwanted and so on.  I really think DH was relieved that I brought the topic up.  He had no idea that I had no desire at all.  I explained how I felt, looked both mentally and physically and he was understanding.  It also says in the book that simple things like a hug, kiss, passing touch also helps.  For me that is all I can and feel like I can do.  So as the book says, what ever you do or do not feel like doing is okay and normal.  And it also states there is no way to give the chemo drugs to your partner. I will be happy to PM anyone who may have additional questions...this book was one I really didn't want to read, but now am glad I did and it clearly answered many of my questions. My personal feelings are we may not feel we look good, and mentally for me just facing each day and wanting the next to be a better day is pretty much all I can handle right now.  Then of course the calendar constantly reminds me of each upcoming treatment...that alone makes me sick with the thought.  I have a strong marriage and trying to be tactful with words one can improvise.  Hope this helps. Anyone having troubles with excessive mucus and nosebleeds?  I do smoke and far less however.  But one nostril feels like a war has taken place.  After treatment 1 I had this problem but it all finally went away.  This time its worse and is lingering.  I am going to talk to the Onc about it when round #3 comes up.  Also on round #3 it is my birthday.  I have been down about having to have treatment and the shot from hell the next day...anyone have suggestions on how I can turn my mind around and make this a positive day even with having chemo.  Generally after chemo I am just mentally pooped out from having to be poked so many times.  Reminder last treatment I ended up with 5 poking before a vein was hit.(4 pokes blew the veins)  I am not going to take my blood pressure medicine before I leave because of the diuretic.  And the one cup of coffee before we left is off limits this time.  I drank tons of water before we left but it didn't help.  So hope no coffee or BP medicine will help find those veins on the first poke this time.  So back to the birthday any suggestions on maybe taking something for other chemo patients and nurses??? Want it to be a happy day not a drudge day! Hope everyone is having a good day! Nadine",

Everyone: Looking at the wide range of costs for the same shots/treatments it really is a racket.  I would think the drugs are manufactured by primarily the same companies.  Makes a person wonder what is seriously wrong.  They have us over a barrel, we need the drugs so with good or bad insurance they know someone is going to pay up.  I know people who have no insurance at all and because of pride won't ask for a free mammogram.  And to top it if you can't get help then your screwed.  I know everyone wants to see the most current tax returns if you ask for help and for most last year was a good year....before cut hours and for many loosing their jobs.  When folks are asking for help consideration needs to be taken that last year is done and gone...this year isn't looking so wonderful for most folks.

Do notice a increased tiredness.  Some joint pain but not to bad.  Eating is hanging in there but slowing down. Trying to do things as much as normal each day but far more resting periods. Evenings seem to be the hard time, not hot hotflashes just plain full body sweats, nothing like the hot flashes I have been having from time to time. Lots of hand washing and lotion of course.  Only drinking about one diet pepsi a day, hitting water and juice hard and heavy.  When sleeping I am out like a light, do notice I have to take a few minutes to let the brain catch up to the body before I can stand however.  My footing is a little off but nothing to bad.  Noticed dark circles coming around the eyes, thinking I need more sleep but don't want to sleep the days away and do think I am resting plenty. Over all it hasn't been as bad as I thought round one of chemo would be.  Still waiting for the day to cut the hair off before it starts falling out.  Not looking forward to that day.  Have wigs but thinking I will probably stick with hats and headcoverings instead.  It will be a rare thing if I wear a wig.  I figure warm head is better than a wig that may itch. Anyway hope you are all doing well also.  And I am so glad we are in this together and we are not alone.  Pretty sad that we have to be here but we do have a wonderful group and we are strong folks who will get through this and get on cancer free before we know it.  Blessings and tons of hugs and good thoughts to everyone.

Hugs to everyone, Nadine",

Doc told me I could use a use commercial mouth wash if I like.  Do have a mixture of 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of salt. Mix dry ingredients together in a closed container.  When ready to use, mix dry ingredient  (1/2 t. to 1t.) in cup of warm water. Gargle. Don't drink.  I did use this mixture last night and it wasn't bad and seemed to feel so much better than a commercial mouth wash. I also brush my teeth a lot, mental think there. My only real problem is bad sweating at night.  Not hot flash type just down to the bone wet.  So far this has been the worst feeling, like having a sticky swimming pool in the bed.  I keep praying like there's no tomorrow and do believe that is helping. Doc gave me a bunch of meds to take home for near everything.  My doc was such a sour puss when I first met him a few weeks ago and he finally smiled...sure made me think he was normal.  Funny how that simple smile helped. Hubby is going to all of the appointments with me and is the brains in in it all.  He remembers and writes down everything.  Pretty darn good nurse also.  He has all of the meds under control and a chart so he knows what was given when.  He has me loaded down with comfort goods so when he is gone I have pretty much anything I need.  I sure lucked out with this guy.  All I basically have to do is chill and he has everything else under control.  How darn lucky I am. Well so far so good really.  Real glad to see all who has joined out April forum.  Thinking about all of you every day and wishing nothing but the best to all.  We are in this together and I do know we will all get past this and go on to enjoying a warm wonderful summer.  Can't mention spring here in my little Idaho town since it thinks winter is back.  Keep the heads high girls and keep those smiles coming and always remember to laugh each day.  Many hugs and kisses and good thoughts to everyone.",

Poor doc (NOT) when I asked WTF!  I was told by the doc's and family experiences that the hair was going to go.  Now my deal was I am growing it (trying to) and in a matter of days I may wake up with hair every where.  So a few mornings ago I felt this weird feeling in my hair.  Hubby was home and I had planned on telling him I felt it was time to shave the head.  Nope, call me weak, I didn't say a word.  Later that day I called one of my daughters who is also fighting another kind of cancer and has lost her hair many times and asked what do I do...after a good ass chewing and more tears that could fill a ocean in its self I knew the time had came to cut all of the hair off.  During this day I had just enough hair to make a pony tail and as you can imagine it felt so good.  My last day of hair and by darn I was going to do it my way.  A couple anxiety pills later I was able to get myself under control and tell hubby take it off.  Hubby is Marine, so he knew what I was saying.  I closed my eyes and off the hair fell.  My fears were to open my eyes and hate what I saw.  What if I opened my eyes and had a odd shaped head or who knows what.  After all was done I slowly opened my eyes and asked for a mirror, took a deep breath and looked...damn I didn't look half bad at all.  I had hubby take before pics and some were pretty sad with all of the tears...suddenly I was the \"bald is beautiful\".  I started laughing and told hubby, \"hell its only hair\".  My precious temple greys are gone (loved those)...I have many different goofy pics because I felt in control.  I beat the mess of the hair falling out probably only by hours...I showed the chemo and cancer who was in control and it was me!  Never knew I had perfect ears...the list goes on.  I feel liberated and finally in control.  I have 3 wigs and more hats and such than I can imagine.  I had such a fear of no hair and because I feel so free I can actually now laugh and smile about it.  I loved my hair as I know you do yours.  Be proud of you, everyone will love you with no hair.  We never asked for this crap, but in our own ways no matter what that may be we can come to terms with it all.  And just think maybe you will have that butt length hair after everything is all done.  Sure my goal!

Hubby got me out of the house today and went to a nearby town and got stocked up on comfort foods for next week.  I am a homebody and this is the first time since I lost the hair that I have been around people really.  Had a royal blue turbine on, put eyebrow pencil on (still have the brows but always so thin), and lipstick and blush.  After the good nights sleep felt like a million bucks.  Funny seeing the reaction of people.  I kept a constant upbeat smile on my face and was extra friendly to everyone.  Some folks had the look of discomfort....others nearly broke their backs to smile a big smile at me and service was supreme.  Sure makes me wonder what my reaction was to others, and for sure opened my eyes.  Bought some scarves that may work on some hats or even tied loosely around my neck in warmer weather.  Been having daily problems with nosebleeds...bought a product I used years ago called OCEAN.  Its a saline nasal spray.  I have another nose spray for moisturizer but it didn't seem to help...so been using the old bottle of left over Ocean...sure helps make the nose feel better.  Also had problems with severe dry eyes.  I had surgery years ago and the eye doc told me not to use the kind of drops that take the red out but to use the kind that only adds moisture to the eyes...again been using an old bottle and got a new one today...helps with eye itch and dry eye.  So hoping the next days are like today...such a breeze.  No naps yet but probably will take one a bit later just for good measure.  So just keeping busy and counting the days for round 2.  Hope everyone is doing good...keep the spirits up and a smile on your face.  Take care my friends, Nadine :)",

Onc told me to take Senokot...once again it takes days for it to even start working.  I drunk so much every day I should be sinking a ship by now.  So today I remembered a previous posting and am going to switch to the cocktail prune juice.  HOPE it works.  During round one all I did was hit the bathroom, and often that was pretty close to just hitting it. On the rash on the head...my scalp broke out with only 4, but painful pimple looking things.  I had been using my regular shampoo because I like the smell of the variety I have.  I bought baby shampoo today and am going to try that and forget my fofo shampoos for when I have hair.  I was putting lotion on my scalp...ended that also.  I also bought baby lotion that is intended for the scalp of babies...and is supposed to help prevent rash and cradle cap.  Steroids I take starting during chemo and follow with 7 days of pills.  They mess me up hard because I already have an allergy to all steroids.  But Onc says its a must to work hand in hand with my chemo.  As long as something works for the sleep during that time I am able to sleep. The shot from hell as I often call it is the one thing I would love to do without but know its a must.  Since my body is all over the place on SE's he told me to take a pain pill before we left to get the shot.  It worked great and I slept most of the hour drive back home.  Did have to take an additional pain pill a couple of times for leg and knee pain from hell.  My memory seems to continue to be very poor.  I continue to have nose bleeds and then my nose is so sore from bleeding so much.  And of course allergies are kicking my tail hard.  My energy continues to be low...low as I know it used to be good before all of these treatments started. Food hasn't been a problem this time, I eat smaller portions and always take a pill for the stomach every day.  I do wonder what round #3 is going to bring.  At this rate I don't know how many more medicines we are going to need.  If I would just stop maxing out on each of the drugs that would be wonderful.  For me the \"normal\" hasn't worked.  Like I told the doc,  So with next visit coming up my list of questions are added.  Good thing the Onc is used to tons of questions because I come loaded with a list.  All I know for sure is I want to sleep, poop and no more pimples on the scalp and private area. Had a weird thing the other morning while in the shower, washed my scalp and for some reason flipped my hair and wiped my face to get the hair out of the way...darn the hair has been gone completely for over a month.  I just stood there and laughed...old habit I guess. Other than that I am doing pretty darn good.  Just keeping positive thoughts and praying tons. Nadine  :)",

I bought a pattern yesterday that has 6 different styles of head coverings.  Going to hope I can stay focused along enough to sew each of them.  Some have tails and some don't and you add elastic for a better fit.  I hate to jinx myself but I am keeping all of my head-coverings and my wig..I am seeing way to many folks returning with cancer again.  (I don't wear the wig however even though its really nice.) I am just damn scared that this is all going to come back in a few years so if it does, I will re-evaluate whether I want to go down this road or just call it quits and wait and see.  I am going to ask my Onc to be straight forward with me as to why are we doing this and then in some it comes back.  I have one boob left and I hate to sound strange but by damn I want to keep it.  I will keep working on new head-coverings just for my mental state of dealing with no hair.  Is everyone having on going memory and focus problems?  Mine hasn't eased up since the first chemo.  It gets worse with the SE's each time but is far from normal in the better days???? Thinking of everyone who is having treatments this week...I hope your SE's are mild.  And we all need constant reminder to drink it up! Hugs and best wishes to everyone, Nadine ",

To Everyone:  Congratulations to all who has recently finished their treatments.  I wanted to quit after the first treatment but kept plugging along until I was finished.  Even as hard as it was I am glad I finished.  I wish there were guarantees that the cancer is gone.  That is my fear, the unknown.  All we can do is live every day to the fullest and hope and pray we are cured.  I often tell DH that I don't know if I can go down this road again.  Guess if need be I will make that decision if it should be in my face again.  I just try to keep a positive outlook on the whole situation.  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  Here in my little Idaho town its once again cloudy and looks like more rain.  Its been downright cold and windy here with bucks of rain.  Supposed to warm up and actually be summer...not holding my breath on that one.  Warm weather would be wonderful as long as it doesn't add to the swollen legs, feet and ankles.

So I have decided going to keep the hair and wait until it starts to come out then...shave it off time.  I did ask if its painful when it starts to come out and she told me some have pain, others have a weird feeling.  I asked if I needed Ensure or Boost...she told me its ok to have or wait and see.  I am of course going to wait and see.  I am a coffee and Diet Pepsi drinker...she told me to make sure to drink a lot of water and juices to replace what caffeine takes out of the body.  I asked about being sick after chemo.  She told me some folks have no problems and others have a wide range of problems.  I am of course wishing for the no problems end of it...however she told me that anything could happen.  Now that is pretty wide of a statement, but then who knows until I start doing all of this.  I am working really hard on keeping a good outlook on all of this...you mind over matter.  I seem to be shaking a lot, nerves.  I have been on Premarin for about 30 years give or take.  I had a total Hyst when I was in my 20's.  So that beautiful yellow pill prevented me from hot flashes and so forth.  After my surgery I was told no more Premarin.  Lucky to not have periods and so happy to not have hot flashes.  The hot flashes seem to come when I am really tired.  So I have found when I feel tired to rest now!  Also a cold wash cloth to wipe my face and lay on my neck seems to help.  One of the things I saw on the video that my Onc loaned to me to watch was this...When we go to the bathroom it is important to put down the toilet lid first, flush two times and leave the lid down.  This is to prevent airborne chemo.  It also says that we will pass chemo thru our urine so this is the reason for this...don't want to share airborne chemo with others.  Also if you have pets or small children this is another way of making sure they stay out of the toilet.  My daughters are all in their 30's but sure remember those times they decided to play splash splash in the toilet.  And yup animals also think its a watering hole.  I am like so many of us a mother, wife and grandmother.  We learn early on to be the caregiver in our families.  I am learning to ease up and let others help me.  Yup, asking for help is hard.  On the asking part also...I am one of those \"read my mind\"...you know that thing, you should know how I feel or what I am thinking.  I am changing that and now if I have questions I will ask.  If I hurt or feel sick, I will tell the doctor and nurses...COMMUNICATION!  We have a strong bunch of ladies and we are all together in this and we will get past this.  And as I have mentioned many times and will continue to say is: Many hugs to everyone.  Nadine",

Well girls hang in there we are doing it our way!  And remember each day to do something special for yourself.  I know thats pretty hard but for me those darn smoothies hit the spot.  Nadine",
