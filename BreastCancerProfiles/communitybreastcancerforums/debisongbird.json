Then last night severe pain in that toe - all night. Took several rounds of pain pills for the pain to become even tolerable. Toenail is now yellow, brown and black. Then this morning, the other foot, on the heel hurt. I looked, and it has a sore-like disurbance on it. Like a blister or burn. Has anyone - ANYONE? -  had similiar side-effects. I'm very upset. When I went to my onc for the black toenail, he said it wasn't the chemo because he had never seen that in his 20 years, etc...Well, we determined it WAS the chemo. Now, I know he will say my sore on my left foot is not chemo related, but what else can it be. I have the nosebleeds, splitting headaches, neuropathy (sp?) in both feet and hands, the discolored toenails and fingernails and now this. What is this? If someone could get back to me and let me know if they had any similiar reactions to TAXOL, I would appreciate it. Odd thing, I had my last Taxol treatment last week - and still having side effects.

      "Content": "debisongbird wrote: Hi ladies, just wanted to get some feedback, if possible. I met with Rad.onc and am set to get marked the 28th. He told me when we met that because of advanced breast cancer, big lump 4.9 cm; 11/20 nodes positive and having it in breast and side and under armpit that my radiation would be extensive, but justified. He said above collarbone, and under armpit and side and entire LEFT breast (that's where my BC is.) Then he said because of the angles, I would lose 20% of my left lung, and he might hit a piece of the heart, in addition, of course to lymphedema, etc... I was shocked at first. I didn't think more damage other than burning could be caused by raditation. He explained because it's on the left side (where heart is) it is more tricky to get everywhere they want to get without some collateral damage. I posted this in Rads thread and 2 ladies there told me this doesn't sound reasonable and to get a 2nd opinion. I thought it might make me feel better, so I scheduled that for next week. Now, I would like to ask any ladies on this forum, has anyone had radiation on your left side? Did anyone ever mention losing 20% of lung? Did anyone ever mention possibly hitting heart? I would just like to know if this is uncommon or more common than I realize. Of course, I am going to do whatever it takes - but when it comes to my decisions, I'm pretty much alone. My regular onc says I have to learn to trust. And I am learning. Any info on this matter would be appreciated.

They screwed up my scheduling somehow - and by the time I got to chemo for my treatment, there was only one nurse on duty and boy was she pissed. She yelled at me. I told her my port uses a 1\" needle (because I've had trouble with it, I know what they use to get it to work, etc...) And she yelled at me! \"I don't HAVE a 1\" needle!\" I was very upset. I had been waiting almost 2 hours (due to someone's error???) and the onc also told me some unsettling news, so I start to cry quietly because she is so mad and now she can't get my port to work. And then she says to me, you need to stop that right now. I am not in the mood and can't handle it. I asked if I could please go and get rescheduled for the next day. She finally let me go, but, boy was she nasty.I was already sort of upset because I only have 1 chemo left and so I asked the Onc when will I get a CT scan or body scan to make sure the cancer is gone. And he said for high risk cases, they don't do a follow up CT scan. They just do a physical exam and a mammogram. I was floored. I said well, you know, with 10 lymph nodes positive and 4.9 tumor, etc. etc...what if it traveled to another part of the body. He said well, in that case, they wouldn't be able to see it anyway at this point and even if they could it wouldn't make any difference as far as my survival went. So he shook my hand, gave me a prescription for Aromasin, and told me that when I finish rads (6 weeks of daily, I think) - then I should start the Aromasin. No scans, nothing. Oh, and I was wondering if any of you ladies could tell me - how long after rads did you wait before starting Aromasin or Femara or ARimidex? Seems like I should wait awhile (to me anyway.) So, that's my story. I'm very upset by my experience today (there was more, but...) Also, I would like to know if any other women were told they don't need any follow up scans (not for high risk onc said.) This doesn't seem reasonable to me, but he said to ask. He said follow up scans just aren't given unless you insist. Also, could someone clue me in about when they started their hormonal treatment after rads. Thanks. And thanks for listening. I am determined. With docs & nurses best wishes, kindness - or not. I am determined. Cancer be gone! Debi Dx 5/2008, 4cm, Stage IIIC, 10/22 nodes Log in to post a reply",
