Leggo, Thanks for posting that thread, that is a pretty cool idea that they had! I read up to the idea about the Vitenam wall.  58,195 names on it over the course of @14 years...it is an unbelievable comparison to make, we loose @ 40,000 women & men every year to breast cancer, that's just breast cancer, in 2012 the exact number was 39,920 and all cancer deaths in the US was 577,190 in 2012.  Prayers for us all...        ",

This morning I saw a local commercial about a car show that has been happening every September for the past few years.  At the car show, they do prostate cancer screening by checking men's PSA levels.  If the levels are abnormal the men (should) follow up with additional testing on their own.  Their idea is that men won't go for the testing on their own so they attract them with something they enjoy and there you go. I started wondering how can breast cancer awareness implement something similar. I know there are mammography vans that go to different locations, etc.  But I came up with a somewhat crazy idea, what if they only let women walk at these fundraisers for bc if the women show proof that they went for a mammogram. I realize that mammo's aren't perfect and all of that but I thought that if this was required for women in a specified age group (of course, those that haven't already had a mastectomy) it would force people to take the walks more seriously. The walks themselves would symbolize a truly positive step in helping women fight breast cancer.  Crazy, right?  I think the organizers would just feel that less people would show up for the walks but I had to put this thought on paper (sorry, ladies).....  ",

Have you watched the interview with Marissa Weiss and Joan Lunden that is posted on BCO? I am not sure how I feel about it except I feel bad for the ILC people because they discuss self exams and I think it would have been a good opportunity to say that not all breast cancer is palpable. I think it is ok to suggest self exams but why not mention that you can't feel some breast cancers. (I'm right about not being able to feel ILC, correct?) They also state that 90% of breast cancers have no family history, I thought it was 70%, so that was an eye opener.",

I recently watched the dvd of the Secret. Has anyone read the book or watched the dvd? Well, they do point out on the dvd to not focus on the disease and focus on the things that we are grateful for. So although the holidays may bring along some aggravation, I am going to try my best for the next few weeks to think about what I am grateful for and the cancer it is not included on that list!

Then when I had even smaller spots later on and the beginning of a spot of basal I used to curaderm and like I said it took awhile but I knew that it worked because when I applied it the spots would get all red and irritated and then finally it stopped doing that, so I knew it was gone.

I just wanted to say that the Lord forgives us always, we cannot possibly always choose the proper words when we know a friend is suffering. I think of Jesus on the cross, even he said WTH in so many words, \"My God, My God why have you forsaken me.\" God always forgives us, he loves us and he understands what is truly in our hearts. Empathy for our fellow man/woman is a good thing and is sometimes difficult to convey in writing. Anger is understandable at times. I believe that all of our sisters here on BCO understand this. Diana, I love those TobyMac pictures that you are posting, keep them coming.",

Because it signifies the Blessed Virgin's passing into eternal life, it is the most important of all Marian feasts and a Holy Day of Obligation.

Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference but it is odd how there are so many things on the web that say that if you are fighting cancer you need to eliminate your sugar intake and carbs which we know turn into sugar.  I just think that Janice along with the radical remission folks have figured this out also.  Just a thought. I think our oncologists don't tell us this because we have cancer already but I do think there is a possibility that it can make a huge difference if we change our diets! I was skeptical about the fact that vegans and vegetarians get cancer too idea but I wonder how much sugar and carbs. they were eating. ",

Recently, I have been doing a lot of reading and most of what I have been reading is related to Marian prophecies some approved and others are not approved, neither of which a Catholic is required to believe. I have also been reading the bible. I am not certain of what the near future holds and I am certainly not trying to convince anyone of any of it. I do suggest that you pray the rosary or any prayers at all will help. Like anything religious there will always be people on both sides of the fence. What I will do is give you some key things to search on the internet so you will be able to research things for yourself. Search for youtube videos on \"September 23, 2017\", \"Illumination of Conscience\"/\"The Warning\". You need to discern these things for yourself, I am letting you know about these things because if some supernatural event does occur it is good to be forewarned and I would feel very guilty if I had said nothing about it. In addition, there are Protestant and Jewish prophecies which are pointing to the next couple of years being crucial not just Catholic prophecies.",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2017 09:27AM - edited Apr 12, 2017 09:46AM by MusicLover Happy New Year and I hope that you had a Merry Christmas. I am so sorry to hear about more women we have lost to this dreadful disease. I don't think many people read my post above this one or I probably would have heard from you. I am posting 2 links for your discernment. If you are a member of another cancer blog website I would greatly appreciate it if you could post these links there also with the message that they, of course, need to decide for themselves. Also, could you please PM me if you do post this information elsewhere and let me know where you have posted it. I plan on trying to distribute the information myself but I don't want to post it somewhere in which it has already been posted. http://romanchristendom.blogspot.com/2013/04/13-april-2017-forthcoming-miracle-at.html http://aronbengilad.blogspot.com/2016_09_01_archive.html Peace and love to you and your families. PS- I don't want to debate over whether or not these things will happen, how would I know for certain. You can find much information on the internet if you are interested, some in favor and some which is not in favor. VERY IMPORTANT: The Miracle is to be announced 8 days before it happens, IOW, if the Miracle is this 4/13/17 then the announcement would be made on 4/5/17 (you should probably look for a note on the websites that I mentioned above or do a search on the web on the day of April 5th to verify if it has been announced). In any case, if the Warning has not occurred before the announcement of the Miracle it may actually be dangerous to go to the location where the Miracle will occur until the Warning has in fact occurred. If you are interested at all in this there are several books for free online about it. Read everything you can and then draw your own conclusions. IMPORTANT update on 4/12/17: Since no announcement has been made, this is not the year for the Miracle. If you are a believer I suggest that you keep looking out for this event by following a Catholic blog.",

      "Content": "Mar 21, 2014 07:04PM MusicLover wrote: If you read about the author's reason for writing this book, she basically says that so much work has been done creating statistics on those who succumb to cancer that she wanted to write about those who overcame a terminal diagnosis.  I think it is interesting but there are absolutely no guarantees.  I think what she means by following your intuition is that you do your research and pick your plan of action that way.  As for the supplements/herbs, that is part of your plan of action.  The plan of action is different for everyone.  From everything that I have researched, the people that have healed themselves naturally really believe that what they are doing is going to work for them.  The people that I am speaking of weren't necessarily terminal.  Just to clarify, the author researched all of these people (I think 1,000 people over 10 years) and those are the top nine factors.  She did not list anything obscure and some of the people definitely did obscure things like go to a healer, ie. John of God.  I have not read the book yet but I do wonder if she had a timeframe for the people she researched.  I do hope that they have been \"cancer free\" for a good period of time (hopefully, 10+ years). I have a friend who is a stage IV lung cancer survivor, after speaking to him and learning about my dx I quickly realized (maybe I'm wrong) that when we are diagnosed if our situation is considered life threatening or if we have an oncologist who wants to take a curative approach, they will treat us aggressively (like my lung cancer survivor friend).  Some times it works out well and people are \"cured\" through conventional medicine going this route (again, no guarantees).  What is interesting about our disease in comparison to many other cancers, is that once we are labeled stage IV they will continue to treat us even if they might have \"cured\" us (I guess because all of these different meds that are available, unlike say for lung cancer.)  My friend has amazed his oncologist but at the same time the oncologist has told him that it will eventually come back and it will kill him at some point.  I have only found 2 stories of women who were diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer and they are not being treated with anything now and they have stated that they are \"cancer free\".  Maybe 3 stories, because it sounds like Dr. Oz may have interviewed someone in this category (I found that out by doing a search on the web but he never clearly states that she was stage IV just that her dr's gave her 5 years).  I definitely do not think that he is advocating opting for alternative over conventional medicine.  I think he is just talking about the situations in which conventional medicine does not offer a \"cure\" and what has worked for some people.  Another story is of a woman named Joyce O'Brien.  I read most of her book, \"Choose to Live\" and I immediately found a discrepancy.  She mentions that when she was dx stage IV they didn't offer her radiation or chemo but later in the book she states that she is so glad that she did not opt for the chemo and that she looked for alternate therapy, hmmm???  We all have heard about healing miracles.  Ebru may have a good point.  ",

For so many years you bore in your own flesh this cancerous disease that destroys the very fibre of our being, and who had recourse to the source of all grace when the power of man could do no more. You were favoured with the vision of Jesus coming down from His Cross to heal your affliction. Ask of God and Our Lady, the cure of the sick whom we entrust to you. (Pause here and silently recall the names of the sick for whom you are praying) Aided in this way by your powerful intercession, we shall sing to God, now and for all eternity, a song of gratitude for His great goodness and mercy.

      "Content": "Feb 20, 2014 07:58AM - edited Feb 20, 2014 08:10AM by MusicLover  I am sad for all of us. Thermography is another one of those things that the holistic people push because it is less detrimental to us, no radiation involved. If your friend got scans they may have gotten her a little more time but you never know what would have happened. I really think some people are lucky for one reason or another when they claim diet saved them and there are bunch of them on youtube/the web.  But unless a biopsy was performed you just never know.  If they claim something lit up on a PET scan and that's the only definitive proof that the cancer spread well, we all know that's not reliable. I have reached out to so many people pushing a special diet to cure cancer and a lot of testimonials are for using it as an adjuvant therapy, not as a cure. Many want a fee for coaching/advice (radar up on that one) but several people have given me a lot of information for free through email and they have even spoken to me on the phone.  I do believe that watching our sugar intake should help us, I hope. Other than that, any diet changes helping us would be a miracle. Let's consider Ruth Heidrich, she is very nice and she is doing very well.  She had a double mastectomy, her cancer spread to bones & lungs as per a PET scan but I don't know if anything was biopsied and then she worked with Dr. McDougall with a diet as opposed to chemo/rads and this got her cancer free. But if this worked so well, Dr. McDougall would have several testimonials of cases but she is the only one for breast cancer that I am aware of. Dr. Lodi seems like he believes in what he is doing and he is a very good speaker but he will even say that the only thing that we our guaranteed is \"today\". This is another sad thing that I thought of, the National Cancer Institute states the estimated new cases and deaths from breast cancer in the United States in 2013:  That's @17-18%, but I can't help but wonder how many of these cases were DCIS because it is up for debate as to whether or not this is really cancer, don't get me wrong some times DCIS cases prove fatal too.  It would be more interesting to see how many DCIS, IDC & ILC cases resulted in death. I do realize that the deaths aren't from the new cases from the same year (that would be awful) but I wonder how bad the statistics really look, how many of us with invasive cancer die from our cancer?  I think it might be more like 50%, that's my guess and if my guess is good, that's a very bad statistic. (Just think of the # of women that you personally knew to have had breast cancer and the number of women who have died from it. I know of 6 deaths and 9 surviving cases so that's @40% still not a great statistic).  Something to think about... PS - I know that there a lot of women who prefer the alternative treatment but if I wasn't stage IV I wouldn't even consider thinking about these alternative methods.  What I say now after my experience is this, \"Cancer is a gunfight, don't show up with a sword\".  Look at Amy Robach, I don't know what kind of breast cancer she has but she is getting chemo. I wonder if she is using the cold cap because she still has a lot of hair.  I do hope that she comes forth with the details. I know it is very personal but I think it can be very helpful.  Suzanne Somers' may have had a DCIS? This is the information that can be helpful to women making these life and death decisions. (Alternative vs. Conventional).  ",

Susan Moss is interesting but I emailed her to ask her if she was biopsied and she emailed me back that she had a touch diagnosis and her symptoms were identical to inflammatory breast cancer. I guess there are always miracles... There seems to be so many of us with English/Irish heritage on this board, maybe I am just assuming that when I see a woman is from New Zealand or Australia or Canada that they have English/Irish heritage.  I am not saying that everyone with breast cancer is English/Irish but I wonder if a study was ever done.  My mom is from Ireland and she would always say that they didn't have the money to buy beef, they ate a lot of tripe and less expensive things like that.  She would even recite the nursery rhyme \"This little piggy\" differently, her pigs couldn't afford roast beef! I think they had jam and bread.                  (Just a crazy thought.)",

This intensive regime included intravenous immune therapy; Infrared detoxification therapy; increasing the amount of oxygen to the body through ozone treatment, conscious breathing and aerobic exercise; visualization, meditation, positive thinking and spiritual awareness; and maximizing the amount of nutrients taken into the body through juicing, wheatgrass and living food nutrition.\"  Maybe another miracle case, I don't know. Best of luck everyone and stay as healthy as you can.  The raw diet just wasn't cutting it for me not entirely anyhow, I am sticking with having my vegetarian soups also.",

Now I am doing all of this reading on cancer and sure enough there is a lot of information out there that states cancer lives in an acidic environment.  The raw vegan diet is supposed to help a person become and stay alkaline, I wish I took more interest in the past.  It may not have made a difference but I would have piece of mind that I did my best to prevent this crappy disease.  Anyhow, it is much more difficult to back track with cancer but I am trying to give it a shot and hope for the best. ",

Thank you!   ",

I have researched Mc Dougall he uses Ruth Heidrich as an example but someone on our board thinks the she was never confirmed at stage IV with a biopsy.  There are so many others that believe in this theory too such as Dr. Schulze, Dr. Tom Wu. Chris Wark, etc.  Some back juicing and some back smoothies, and some back both. The smoothies retain all of the phytochemicals from the seeds and skins of the fruit and veggies.  I have been doing the smoothies but lately I have been skipping them a little bit.  If you have time please do a search on a member on this site called Janice54 she states she went vegan the day after her stage IV dx and has been NED for 7yrs just on tamoxifen no chemo, no surgery & no rads.  I hope she is not a fake, it seems like to much effort to post the way that she has. I started this thread just to get this information out to all of you and to see what you think.  I am very skeptical but I want to remain hopeful too.  I wish us all many, many more years!   (off to eat another salad, yippie!!! )",

It has only been 3 weeks for me being on Femara and I have heard that many of us have had wonderful results on it for long periods of time. I am not post menopausal so I get a shot of Zoladex once a month along with 20min IV of Zometa. I menstrated 2 weeks after my first injection of Zoladex but I read on this site that is normal and my nurse said similar. Has anyone experienced this? If so, did you have any additional bleeding while on Zoladex? Thanks for your help. PS - Does this ever get any easier?

You need them to do a bone biopsy on one of the mets, two problems first is, is it possible to reach the spot to do the biopsy and second problem, is if you do have more then one spot lighting up and the first one that they biopsy comes up negative, they should biopsy the next spot and so on, so on.  One way or another I hope that you can have stage IV confirmed before you begin treatment for it. You can't be truly certain about only one lymph node unless they remove them and dissect(?) them, none of my lymph nodes lit up on the PET scan but one was biopsied positive for cancer. (When you say no TM's the level is 0?).

One thing I learned very quickly is if I don't ask the \"right\" questions to my Onc I just get another rosey picture painted. I don't think I am wrong about this but I believe that the biophosphonate is really to help strengthen your bones because the Femara (& in my case, Zoladex) have weakening effects on bones (post menopausal stuff). I have read that the biophosphonates may help with the healing of the bone mets but I have also heard that may not be the case either. They probably have no way of knowing which is doing which, if it is the AI that's healing them alone or the biophosphonate is helping. I hope your pharmacist is incorrect for both of our sakes. I want to ask my Onc about radiation therapy if the bone mets are getting worse, based on what I have read on this board that seems to be a real good way of getting the cancer out of there. But I imagine that it can only be used on certain spots. If anyone with more experience with radiation on bone mets could comment that would be great, for instance, what was the deciding factor to use radiation therapy? and what are the down sides (how much damage to surrounding tissues, etc.) Thanks for the help.",

When I first started treatment I had a lot of pain in the places where the cancer is but it did get better, so I hope that is the case for you too. I am having a lot of difficulty with the mental piece of this too.  I am hoping now that the weather is getting better and since I enjoy gardening it will take my mind off the cancer.  I see that you like gardening too.  Try and not think too far out into the future and do things that you like to do, of course, things that don't cause you any pain.  I only think about the treatment working and for a long time. I know the whole \"positive thinking\" thing bugs a lot of people but it does help me and it may help you too. I hate the treatment and I hate the scans too, I sense that is what you are saying on your blog also.  But for whatever reason I ended up with this horrible disease and all of the medical stuff is keeping me around and I know you feel that way too.  There are some really wonderful drugs on the horizon which may even cure us, honestly (anti-CD47).  I think about that and it keeps me going (and I don't care if others think I'm delusional). I also changed my diet to help me feel empowered.  I hope that I helped... Oh, and in my opinion it hasn't helped me to get suggestions from the healthy people in my life - that just may be me though.  They mean well but some times I get one of the comments from the thread \"Stupid things people say to MBC patients\" and I don't want to hear that stuff.          ",

I think we MBC patients/BC patients and their loved ones have asked for more research funding it is to make certain that when people donate to a breast cancer organization we would like to see a big chunk of that money put towards research. I think that when money is collected for lung cancer I would hope that it would be the same. Now, when money is donated to the American Cancer Society that is a different story and I don't think anyone on BCO has ever asked for more of that money to go to bc research over another cancer's research. With that said, some of the latest things that I have read is that some researchers are looking at cancer as one disease or something along those lines. Time will tell if that idea will work but there are many drugs which are being used for multiple types of cancer. As for her statement, \" I have heard that some metastatic breast cancer patients have told patients with other cancers that metastatic breast cancer needs and/or deserves more funding than they do\". I don't believe that this is true.",

I just added myself to the thread \"What age were you at diagnosis?\" or something like that.  I have thought about this a lot and I want your opinions.  First off, I have a newbie question.  If you are treated in the earlier stages I read that there is a test that your onc can do on your cancer cells to see how effective a particular chemo tx will be, is that the case and how often do you think that it is used? I know of the onco test, but that is to see if you need chemo or don't, correct?  Ok,  now here goes for the crazy....that thread about the age at dx, got me thinking because some women state the orig stage and then they give age at stage IV.  I think it would be interesting to see info for orig dx like age, stage size of tumor (largest if more then one), first line tx and then age at stage IV.  To me it should be enough to see that 40K women die of this disease in the US alone (I think it is 500k annually internationally?) but to see that women who were dx orig at an early stage, or late stage with a relatively small tumor or no tumor at all.  It just boggles my mind and should tear on the heart stings of humanity that something needs to be done.  I feel this way about cancer in general but do other cancers recur the way that breast cancer seems to? I am becoming better educated on this everyday - is it helping? Not sure... (every time I read an old post of mine, I find some error...)",

Mzmerz, I have read about Dr. B. too, was he mentioned in Kelley's book too? I think there must be some value to reducing the sugar that we intake but I think everyone will make their own mind on how they want to live.  Most people on the web calling themselves a cancer coach suggest to reduce the sugar intake. Kris Carr is another person like that, she has a pretty informative website if anyone is interested. Anko66, It's funny that you mention the role of the mind since the first thing I did today was watch a youtube video from a guy who basically is preaching \"The Secret\" and he even talked about the women on that film who cured her breast cancer by thinking all good thoughts.  Then I watched part of a video from Bruce Lipton on the same subject but he started saying that we assume our parents' diseases by thinking that we will get them.  For me it was just the opposite, my Mom never had cancer so assumed I would be lucky like her and I assumed I wouldn't get breast cancer so I went straight to stage IV (lucky me!).  The only thing that makes a little sense to me, is when they talk about how if you say you don't want something you will get it but honestly, what woman hasn't said that to themselves when someone mentions breast cancer.  I just hate how everything comes back to the possible mistakes that I made, I hate the wrong foods or had the wrong thoughts. Here is a question: Does God give us the diseases we get? or Is it our actions that cause them? Or is it just an imperfection in our bodies? What else would explain it when children get cancer? Isn't it just a biological imperfection?  Some people are exposed to so much stuff and they don't get cancer while others do.  So I do wonder how much difference my diet is going to play in my longevity? Last but not least, I said to one of my girlfriends that I would much rather have a quick death and she said that she has read a lot and the suffering is supposed to bring us closer to God.  Does that make us feel any better? I would say no. ",

That is what I meant by questioning if what I eat now will really have an effect on how long I stick around. The only regret I have is giving up the control that I had in preventing my death from this disease by believing my physician's dx and not doing any further investigating but I am not sure that things would have turned out much different had I taken another path, that I will never know.  My last comment on God, is not to say that any of us are guaranteed a perfect life, of course not, we all know that someday we are going to die and we don't have any control over when and how that will happen.  I never thought I wouldn't live a similar life to the life that my mom has lived as far as longevity goes but that's probably how we all think. Some people who are very religious welcome the thought of going to heaven, I would much rather have had several more healthy and happy years with my family before I was confronted with my mortality (not unlike most of us thrown into this situation).  I totally understand your point of view.  Caryn, You are doing very well physically and you don't seem to be very fearful of the dx.  The toughest thing that I am going through right now, is the fear. So I was/am trying to do whatever I can to feel like I have some control.  I feel fairly well and I can function normally too but the fear of knowing that I am in this situation is still difficult mainly when I am waking up in the morning.  I have a very peaceful sleep but then once I realize that my reality is back I have a minor panic attack, not enough for me to take a Xanax but I just wish I could get that to go away.  I also was a very healthy person so the thought of the monthly tx's and the quarterly scans make me a little crazy too. Do you experience this at times? You seem very calm about everything all of the time, is that the case?  Or can you offer some advice for dealing with it? (Not including a psychologist or meds). Thank you, your opinion is always welcomed or I wouldn't post these ideas.",

I wonder if the stress is going to kill me before the cancer does, I said that from the beginning.  Heidihill, At first when reading Janette Wakelin's story it sounds like she did no conventional treatment but I think she falls into that category where she had surgery and then opted to go holistic in place of chemo & rads. If I can confirm this I'll post it. She still has a good story though.  All of those stories are good but not a real wow for me if they had surgery. There are some who claim no surgery at all, those are wow stories but are they true?  ",

Like taxotere, taxol and a/c. My onc's approach is to use the meds with less side effects first and see how it goes. Have any of you just been on hormone therapy? Any with no hair loss as a result of meds? Lotusblossom and QueenOfHope, I know of someone like you.

It's not that I know so much now but about a month ago I wondered if what I had going on was related to the lymph nodes, I looked at a picture similar to the one that you posted here.  Then I started thinking what a fool I was, I got so mad at myself.  Finally, I thought to read my original PET scan again, nope not a lymph node (it would state that, correct?). They have them classified under the breast section, it says nothing about lymph nodes.  I think I fall into the 3% category, that is what I call it anyhow.  You know how it is stated that a preventative BMX is effective 97% of the time.  That is just how I think of it.  In other words, if I had gotten a prophy BMX, I imagine that I still would have been dx with breast cancer.  Thank you for answering me, it is truly haunting me (can you tell?). MO would not answer any questions about this when I first started with him, I may ask him again to be absolutely certain and I will post his answer here. He may be willing to discuss since he knows me for over a year.  His comment last year was it didn't make a difference to how I was being treated.  I am so glad that you remain in remission.  You went through a lot in my opinion and I am so glad it has been beneficial to you.  ",

(first names is just easier) Ann did not take my insurance but Linda did, she was my oncologist on diagnosis but I wanted convenience so I moved closer to where I live. I use Dr. Steven Sugarman at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Commack if you want to stay on Long Island.  I also heard that Julie Fasano is very good there but I have never met her. I recently met with a Dr. Stephen Malamud at Beth Israel in NYC, I think he is amazing (I only met with him once though).  He recently ran a webinar on metastatic breast cancer, so I think he stays on top of everything for sure.  He seems bright and is very, very caring! If I ever feel the need to change I would go to him, it's just a bit inconvenient.  I hope this helps. I am just adding on that I have extremely high anxiety too and based on that if it is not too inconvenient for you, I really suggest Dr. Malamud 1st, then Dr. Moore or Dr. Fasano.  Verify that they accept your insurance, that may help with your decision making.",

At least see if the vets are willing to do this for you.  I am not sure how social media will help because I think you would need a way to contact people around the area where your dog was lost and I am not sure how to do that.  Otherwise, think of the hassles that you are getting now and multiple that by quite a bit.  Good Luck!",

I am not talking about bone mets, I mean a tumor. It was small but they literally turned the mammography machine sideways (vertical) stuck whatever they could into it.  I also had an ill-defined tumor that looked snake like next to my sternum also. (The lady who did by ultrasound asked me if this crap was a scar, so I am assuming this doesn't happen that often). I honestly shook every night I went to bed last fall because I never thought that what I had was breast cancer and I walked around like this for a couple of months.  I thought this only happened after being treated for breast cancer when the cancer may return in an unusual spot.  It just has bothered me so much for a year now that I just don't know how they could have gotten me in remission.  I know this is cancer and it is unpredictable but really, has anyone else experienced such a thing before a stage IV diagnosis and they put you into remission?  (I do get a good night's sleep now thankfully but during the hours I am awake I can't help but think I have been cursed or something).

Ok, so now the question is what should I do with the $175? lol.  ",

I don't know if you noticed what I posted on another thread that I noticed that there seems to be a lot of us on this board who come from English/Irish heritage. Sure enough, if you watch that youtube video that Mrs Chang posted, the presenter puts up a map of the world and shows the cases of breast cancer by % in different colors in all parts of the world.  The areas that have the highest percentage were all colonized by the British more or less.  India and Hong Kong were the only locations that didn't fall into the high percentage category but I wonder how many Brits relocated there permanently.  It's just interesting to me, may there is something to my idea.  Maybe it is the heritage along with the diet.  I have watched a lot of Paul Nison's youtube videos and today I found another web site Arnold's Way (then I realized that these guys know each other).  Arnold claims to have helped women cure their breast cancer with a raw food diet.  He is pretty specific about what I need to do. He has a video on youtube called 7 steps to staying young (I need 7 step to staying alive) but if anything, he is entertaining! How the hell did I get myself into this mess? It's 1 in 8 women now that will get bc.  Well, I have a group of 8 friends, woohoo lucky me!  If only my luck with the lottery was that good.  This is always going to stink and I knew that, we all knew that.

Her thought was that the Chinese do not eat dairy products and the rates of bc is much lower.  I was on a pizza binge in the last few years, tons of cheese. Try some almond milk in your coffee, it is surprisingly good.  It might not be too farfetched to cut meats out too, even though the package may state it is not treated with hormones who knows.  Janette is honest in saying that she went for a lot of holistic treatments.  I have seen a few stories from people on the web who will say that they cured their cancer with mainly a raw food diet and meditation, etc. It's all interesting but I am definitely not sure what I believe.  I originally didn't mean for this thread to be almost a repeat of the thread I started on Raw Food Diet...oops. You can reference that thread for a similar discussion. ",

Do you have pain?  I hope that you figure it out or even better the symptoms disappear by themselves.",

They take whatever medication that they need to deal with this crappy disease, I mean pain meds, anti-depressants and anxiety meds, whatever.  They just feel that their onc. will put them on something else when the current med. has failed. I am still in the phase of wishing this never happened, mad at myself for not being more pro-active and missing the me of the past (active, fun loving, not having to think about meds & scan results, etc.)  I also watch everyone else going on with their lives as normal but I know of woman who recently passed on from the chemotherapy they gave her, so out of respect for her I try to be thankful for each day. I made a friend who after 28yrs had a recurrence at 70 and she is going on 77 now and she just keeps going.  She has bad days too of course but she just feels that she will be around for a long time still and that's the bottom line. (One day at a time). Let's all do something that we really enjoy doing today (it may not be the most physical activity) but let's not think about the cancer while we are doing it. ",

You can't always figure it all out until you look into their story.   I also found a youtube video of the CEO from Sloan Kettering discussing how sugar can be contributed to causing cancer. Bottom line is we will probably never know why we got this wretched cancer and we will never know if any of these crazy diets will help us.  So, try the diet changes if you like but beware about what you read on the internet. (There's a very nice lady who used a raw food diet to help her after her melanoma had spread.  I asked her through emails about Linda McCartney getting breast cancer and the fact that she was a vegetarian for many years and she had a good answer for me, she said that we don't know how much of her diet was raw and how much sugar she ate. At least, she was ready for my question.).",

I have so many other things I should be spending my time on. Sadly if I keep this up, my kids are going to remember me as a crazy person, crying often and looking for a non-existent silver bullet instead of spending more quality time with them.  I really do hope that I am done with it already. ",

I am looking forward to what others say. Try very hard not to cry in front of your husband and your child, this will not always be possible but it is almost like you need to train yourself a little bit.  Cancer really stinks but people deal with a lot of health problems, for instance, what if you had a heart problem.  Believe me this is a struggle for me too.  I am just giving you some of the advice that I give myself, I hope it helps a little bit.",

I wanted to make a suggestion to you, do you think it might be worth while to reach out to Stanford University and see if you get on the Phase II of the clinical trial for anti-CD47? You can email them and let them know that you are interested so when they begin phase II they will already have your name? I hope that you don't mind me suggesting it. I am hoping for a miracle for you and all of us.",

Like I said, I am very curious to see the results that they have obtained so far.  Is it possible for you to speak to a former patient who has had long term success with this?  How long have they been doing this treatment for?  I think the interesting thing is that I have a friend who had stage IV lung cancer and his tumor was inoperable and he had one bone met.  They gave him a chemo cocktail and radiated his bone met and he has been NED with no meds for 10+ years (maybe 15 - my memory is going) but for breast cancer they rarely try and \"cure\" us if we are stage IV.  I wish you the best and I hope that you are a trail blazer for others. (Why not have your MO speak to the dr. in Florida? He won't do that?  Take Leggo's advice - schmooze a little...I would politely say \"this is my life, when I run out of options I don't want to have regrets that I didn't try this.\" Also ask him what the negative side would be.  Don't you get MRI's regularly anyway or some type of scan? If that is the case, I hope he would order the MRI for you. I wouldn't request something this big through an email, ask for a consult with him.)  http://www.aboutcancer.com/oligomets_milano_0108.htm http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995374/ (maybe I showed him this too) I can't find the Japanese based one, only one for stage IV prostate cancer.     ",

MSKCC says to mindful of that also but if our treatment is hormone therapy then fire away with those anti-oxidants and vitamin C.  I have read that we should also watch the vitamin C supplements that contain sugar, so look for the ones that have no sugar. (I'm sure it's minimal but if we are trying to help ourselves then why have the added sugar.)",

My MO does not really like me asking questions, he answers them but he is a little defensive.  I had to ask for PET scans because they prefer CT scans over them, I think that the PET scan offers a little more detail (a very reputable MO at another hospital suggested that I request the PET scan).  I did read on BCO that there are advantages to all of these tests.  Even with the PET scan it depends on who reads it as to what the report states.  I just looked at the report for a CT scan that they did on me and the only detail offered for bone mets is stable or new, no sizes or SUV's. What exactly does it say in the report about the bone met (the one that either is clearing up very well or got worse)? Also, what do they mean by your mom's blood tests being the best they've been? Are they referring to the tumor markers?  My tumor markers seem to be consistent with my scans, in other words, if my tumor markers go up then my scans show increased cancer activity and possibly a new bone met. But most mo's do not rely on tumor markers, so I would  suggest that your mom requests a couple of consecutive PET scans, she will then know if things are getting better or worse, the SUV's will be stated for each bone met and if they SUV's are going down that is good, going up is not good.  Are you aware that your mom can access the results from all of her tests online?  This is a great aid to see trends and get a feel for what is happening with her cancer. (https://my.mskcc.org/login?logout=true) I hope this is helpful and I am interested to see what others say. Best wishes to you. (Lindsey, By the way, how are you doing?)  ",

It is too late for us but it would be nice if someone figured it out. Yeah, I hear in Asia they call it the \"Rich Woman's Disease\" (in other words, wealthy people eat more lavishly?)  I would go with the fast food reason for me.  I also barbecued red meat often and the carcinogens there in aren't good for you.

MO was talking about changing me to Aromasin (sp?) but I too want to stretch out femara for as long as I can. I convinced MO that we should wait but when I got home I realized that the bone met with the higher SUV went up twice in a row, so then I started to feel a bit nervous. Luckily, last month TM's went down a little bit from previous month when the scan was done. All of this makes me a little crazy, hoping that we did the right thing and that the next scan isn't worse. If tm's go up I will be asking for a scan sooner then later. I wonder how they choose next treatment? Maybe mine should be faslodex also? I am going to bookmark this so I remember what was suggested as your next treatment. I wish that there was a sure bet path to follow, lol. I am glad that you have some good news and I hope that the next scans are good and you can stay the course with femara for another 20yrs and me too and then we can move on to something else for another 20. Keep us updated.",

So it's good news. Hoping for good news for everyone this time or in the near future.     ",

My tm's are good but the scan did have increased SUV's on the bone mets but honestly I think that there are some errors, what was left is now right on iliac. It is making me a bit crazy. Good news I think but not 100% certain, nothing eye popping in my opinion (so my assessment is stable). Carla, Good luck to you too.

Sorry to repeat your thoughts but I think as I have gotten older I have less patience for nonsense in the media. Others may find it entertaining and that's fine. When I watch the news I want to learn something and if I want entertainment I'll watch a comedy. As for this thread, I think we all understand the frustration that the media creates when it comes to cancer and I don't think that people are punished for venting a little bit.  Everyone knows that a lot of money is raised in the fight against cancer and yet early detection does not always insure several years of remission.  I have even seen the phrase on this board \"Early detection is the cure\" or better yet I have seen the phrase on the web \"Early detection prevents cancer\", really?  I don't think anyone wishes Amy Robach any harm but the media needs to be more empathetic for those who have lost their battle with cancer.",

I don't know if any of you have noticed this but I stopped watching GMA along time ago because it is rarely about the news.  I hope that someone from that show will read this....a huge percentage of what they talk about is themselves - that is not the news!!! and NBC is not much better. CBS does a much better job of giving you a picture of what is going on in the world. Just some food for thought, the best way to send them a message is to not tune in. PS - You don't have to agree with me, everyone has a right to their own opinion.  ",

I would ask about the fracture, what is the plan for that? A second opinion might be a good idea or at the very least request another scan using the same equipment in the very near future.  This way you will know if you are in fact improving on the meds or not. ",

That may be what your onc. is thinking too.  I know of lot women on here don't feel that tumor markers are a good indicator and their oncs say the same but if your onc. is unwilling to give you another scan in the near future, can you possibly use your tumor markers as an indicator of how things are going?  I do that in between scans, if the tumor markers are basically the same from month to month or possibly lower it helps give me better sense that I am doing ok.   Push for the same scan soon and let us know what happens,",

Best of luck! Jpsara, Hang in there, I only wish I was in your shoes! I know many women with bmx's and most do not share the info with anyone that they do not have to, you may want to consider doing the same. It will give you time to adjust to your situation mentally and once you realize how much life you will be living you will be so glad that you are around to live it!  Praying for a cure.....no one should have to deal with this! The other ladies are correct though in stating that with neo-adjuvant chemo you will know if it is working or not, but definitely do the adjuvant chemo regardless!",
