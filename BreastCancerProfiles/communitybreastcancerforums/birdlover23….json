Warrior - cute video :)  Reminds us all to do at least a little something on our last days of chemo. Asb - for the BMX - when you get home, sleep upright as much as possible.  If you have a recliner or can borrow one, that would be perfect.  Find out from your PS what you will be wrapped in when you wake up from surgery.  You will most likely have ace bandage all around you, but under that, I had the worst surgical bra ever.  After I was home for a few days, I finally just ripped if off in the middle of the nigh.  My PS is no longer using it, I told him how tight and horrible it was.  Very painful.  Take your pain meds and you can get through it.  You've already done chemo, so you can do anything :)",

Hair loss - yes it is worse than losing my breasts.  And yes it is petty, but I would like to keep something of myself.  I just had my first dose dense chemo on Wednesday, so I should have a good week or so until I need to watch it fall out.  I bought a halo, a hairpiece for under scarves and hats.  I think it will look cute.

I started my first chemo yesterday and I am very glad my husband went with me.  Before giving me the chemo meds, I was given Kytril and the steroid, which I did fine with.  Then they gave me Emend.  I had a very severe allergic reaction it.  My face got red, I was sweating and tingling all over, saw stars, very nauseous, I almost passed out.  They stopped it right away and gave me a heavy dose of Benedryl.  That did not help too much at all, so they gave me Compazine.  That did the trick but it took a good hour.  I was really bad off, so nauseous, it was scary, but once I was fine, I ate lunch and then got the two chemo drugs (AC).  I took those just fine.  I will not be getting Emend again.  Has anyone else had any bad reactions like this? I was very sleepy the rest of the day from the Benedryl.  Today, I have just been a bit shaky and groggy.  The dry, fuzzy, metal tasting mouth is starting.  All in all, today has been a good day.  My Dad took me to the dr for a shot of Neulastra today and I am fine so far. I ordered this today http://www.shop.simplyyouboutique.com/Brian-Josephs-Lash-Brow-Conditioning-Gel-BJ-Eye.htm.  I hope it works.  We'll see :) I found this wonderful organization http://crickettsanswer.startlogic.com/.  Please read the background story.  They will give you free hair loss supplies and services.

I have long hair, so I need to get it cut soon.  Trying to see how long I can wait. Thanks :) Susan",
