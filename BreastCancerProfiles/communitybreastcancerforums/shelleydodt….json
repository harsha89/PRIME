Please visit our website Penniesinaction.org. We are trying to raise funds and awareness of a breast cancer vaccine that is in clinical trials (for women with DCIS Her2/Neu right now, invasive and triplenegative cancers next year. There are so many women who will be needing help and prayers and so many researchers who need our help to make the vaccines we need. Big pharmaceuticals have no interest in curing cancer. There are billions of dollars made on selling chemo every year. We have to work together to save ourselves! Congratulations! Shelley",

I had highly suspicious Birads 4 and had multiple biopsises done on them , all came back benign. I did however have DCIS in my underarm area which hadn't formed a lump yet. I just had it cut off for cosmetic reasons. It was 2.5 cm DCIS with Her2/neu. If it had been left to grow, it would have likely became invasive cancer. So I went to the Univ. of Pennsylvania and got a vaccine made from my own cells to prevent anymore DCIS fom growing because I started to imagine it could pop up anywhere. Check out my website, shelleydodt.com for more info. There IS a vaccine, for WOMEN to prevent DCIS with Her2/neu in it from coming back. Next year he will start with a vaccine for invasive and triple neg breast cance too. Visit Penniesinaction.org. Hopefully, you will be just fine!",

I personally set Google Alerts for \"cancer vaccine\"\" Breast Cancer Vaccine\", \"breast cancer vaccine trials\" ect and get everything published on the web, blogs or news sent right to my email every day. Dr. Czerniecki is going to be expanding our trial, to invasive and ER+ and I know he is anxious to tackle triple negative. I will be attending the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this Dec. and I heard there was going to be some presentations on vaccines and triple neg. BC. I am really excited about the progress being made in ALL cancer vaccines. There are many types, DNA, Dendritic cell, Tumor DNA. Google cancer vaccines and you will get a plethora of info. The vaccines are wonderful because they don't just attack rapidly dividing cells like chemo and rad, they actually can program your immune system to look for cells exhibiting the biomarkers anywhere in the body.  could go on for days, but for everyone suffering from this beast, there has never been a more hopeful time in history to turn cancer into a chronic disease and a good chance to be able to prevent it. ",

So it is one for Stage 0 and also for invasive that has microinvasion. I know Dr. Vincent Tuohy's trial will be prophylactic to actually prevent BC. I know 5 women all in different BC vaccine trilas, one Muc1, another for DNA, another for tumor, and two others for Her2. I am urging everyone to google alert all these topics so we can all help each other. The wonderful thing about the trials is that they are FREE except you must pay your travel expenses. Most women think their local doctors knows all about all trials but in my experience the only one doing intensive searching for the best treatment is the BC patient herself!",

Mine was for DCIS/Her2/neu+ and they are extending the trial for Er receptor positive soon as well as for invasive breast cancer. There are 35 vaccine trials RIGHT NOW for breast cancer. Visit BCTrials.org and you can see them or visit govtrials.org and it may be hard to find one if you don't know terminiology. Oncolink.org is another great source. They will actually assign a navigator person to help you and they even check back with you to see how you are doing! Yes, I absolutely believe that vaccines are the way to go. My friend Michele Salvo died last Thursday and she has been conversing with Dr. Vince Tuohy and he wrote the nicest most sincerest note, he said he actually had tears in his eyes to think of all the needless deaths from breast cancer. Dr. Brian Czerniecki (the one who made my vaccine) also has used the words needless deaths many times too. So big Pharma doesn't want to pay for the research, they will step in and want to market it when it is proven and profitable. NIH is getting funds for trials so that  is why I am involved with Pennies In Action 501c3. We directly FUND DR BRIAN CZERNIECKI. All volunteer, no expenses for us, we just take donations and the money goes right up to the trial. Check out my website www.shelleydodt.com and penniesinaction.org for more info. And any one wants to contact me in confidence sdodt@me.com. I am a breast cancer vaccine advocate 24/7 because I am so grateful I was able to get one and it WORKED!!!!",

There are also other trials in other parts of the country for her2/neu invasive disease. Mine so far was DCIS with her2/neu and I am still waiting for my biopsy and margin pathology after my third surgery. I have to say, if anything else goes wrong, I am opting for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. Let me know what you find out?",

Jeanne told me today that she is only involved with the DCIS hers2/neu but there are so many other trials up there. My experience was excellent. They got me in as soon as possible, did all the tests as fast as they could, the doctor was very receptive, they had a whole team approach that really made me feel comfortable. I even saw a psychiatrist, Dr. Ruth Steinman who prescribed Lexapro and clonazapem and these two drugs really helped me relax and feel strong to do what I needed to do. I stayed at the Inn at Penn which gave me a 30% discount hospital rate when I needed to spend the night. I could safely walk the beautiful Penn Campus and I found great comfort eating over at Cosi's restaurant which had great and healthy food. So yes, I would feel very positive about U Penn's trials. Let me know! Oncolink was so good they even called me back to see how things were going and promised to let me know of any other ones that would apply to my condidtion. Breast cancer happens-we are the only ones who can stop it from taking over our lives! ",
