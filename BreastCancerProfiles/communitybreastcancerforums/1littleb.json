I think telling them about the surgery I am already scheduled for (repairing a labral tear in my hip) helped move me up on the call list for cancellations. I got the call back letter today. If I had gotten this first I would have gone in to full panic. I think they need to rewrite their form letter. It says they saw something that requires further study, please schedule.",

I can breath a bit better knowing I don't have to wait months where if something is growing it has extra time. I had a digital mammogram that doesn't allow the tech to go to the next view until she approves the current one. I like the idea that she is an idiot over the idea that something is wrong with me. Though she did mark the scar from the ductectomy, I'm hoping that scar tissue explains the concern area on the right breast, on the left I got nothing other than the tech is an idiot. Sorry if anyone here is a mammogram tech, but it comforts me to think mine didn't do her job correctly.",

Combination of overlapping tissue, more scar tissue from previous surgery than expected and they forgot Â to mark a small mole - they almost forgot again. Thank goodness. I wish all of you well and negative test results. Thanks for being here.",

Now I just had this year's mammogram last Wednesday at the same center and I got the call this morning that I need to come back for additional views and possible sonogram of both breasts because of overlapping tissue. What does that mean? Did the tech do a lousy job? With all her rearranging and waiting to see if she got a good view is that possible? My doctors office said they didn't see any masses or cysts but wouldn't go into further detail. Has anyone else been told they had overlapping tissue? Log in to post a reply",

What I still don't get is why, with digital images the tech couldn't see that it was a poor image. She looked at each view before going to the next. Couldn't she see that there was overlapping tissue, redo it then and there and save time and worry? This hasn't been my best year. I went in for my yearly exam and they found a giant ovarian cyst which I had removed in June and in October I have to have hip surgery. Maybe my normal optimism is a little worn out and I'm being hypersensitive to anything that doesn't just pass on the first shot. PS Just made the appointment for the repeat and the woman looking at my chart did not mention overlapping tissue. She said in comparing my last mammogram with this one there is an area of concern on the right breast seen in one view and not the second and another area on the left that they would like to get a better view of. I asked about overlapping tissue and she said that was always possible. The appointment isn't until October 23. Good Lord, I hope they have a cancelation before then. Optimism may completely fail me by then.",
