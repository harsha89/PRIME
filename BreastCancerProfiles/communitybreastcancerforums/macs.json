Now I'm on Gemzar but only had one treatment after which my blood cell count bottomed out.  I'm on a one month chemo vacation now but my cancer count keeps on going down. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the chemo is a poison, not only for the cancer but for the whole body.  If your doc thinks it's time to be off, he/she is probably right and trying to watch out for the whole you, not just the cancer.   I hope you find relief from the symptoms and the worry.

My onc put me on abraxane rather than taxol because it was supposed to be easier on my system.  However after three treatments my feet were numb up to my ankle and my fingertips were also numb.  My doc was surprised to see the reaction coming so quickly.  We're all so different that it's amost impossible to predict what will happen, thus the problems for the docs. I hope you will make it through your vacation as planned.  But if not, you will still make it through.  And your family will be there for you.  And this will not be your last vacation.  I'm working on hiking Colorado trails again this fall for the first time in three years!  Hope reigns.

Turns out the Xeloda did more than hand/foot sydrome and fatigue to me.  I was also hit with explosive bouts of diarrhea.  One day I was talking with a student, female luckily, and finally jumped up and said I would be back.  Before I even made it across the hall into the bathroom, the crap was running down my leg.  The dear student ran to her apartment and brought me a pair of sweats I could put on after I cleaned up.  And then I went home, mortified, but able to laugh. So two things.  Xeloda is indeed CRAP.  And don't take it when you're on crutches.  Diarrhea and crutches don't mix. Keep the faith, Diane ",

The doc put me on Gemzar after that but my blood count bottomed out so I never had it again.  Instead I had embolization to my liver that had basically no side effects.  But I'm still struggling with the neuropathy.  I have a rod in my femur for a break so I'm very careful about walking.  I will be seeing an occupational therapist soon so I can learn how to get around with this numbness.  I am refusing to trip and fall a third time.  I really like my orthopedic surgeon but not enough to break my leg a third time. Good luck, Diane ",

I would not hesitate to go with the abraxane.  It's not bonded with \"draino\" the way others are so is much easier on the system.   Wendy, I loved your message when your brain blanked out.  Chemo brain has also been a side effect of the abraxane.  Your, oh crap, is so familiar and honest..... Hang in Jill. Diane ",

Instead she started me on small weekly doses of Gemzar and carboplatin.  This week I'm going to get a port for the first time in the fourteen years I've been dealing with this disease.  That Gemzar hurts going in so badly, stings like a nest of hornets.  But I was back to work quicker than with the other drugs. I'm taking Gabapentin for pain at night that helps me sleep, although you wouldn't know it from the time of this post. Previous drugs for bone mets have been tamoxifen, aromisin, femara, faslodex, mega doses of estrodial (what a trip that was going back to puberty), aromasin again, then to Xeloda.  I was off Xeloda for 10 months, recovered from my second titanium rod insert in my femur, was feeling good for the first time in two years, when I was diagnosed with the liver mets.   Tracy, it's so hard to keep on fighting, but we'll do it.
