I've bookmarked for later use the site you sent me. I do appreciate any and all help. I think I'm going to head to another Discussion Board on Chemo. I need to make a suggestion to those receiving Taxotere. One of the side effects can be a red, burning discoloration along the vein above the site of the infusion. My chemo was/is 4 sessions. I had a 3 inch discoloration the first session. The 2nd infusion resulted in the toxic burn from my wrist to my elbow along several veins. When I saw the dermatologist, they had never seen anything like it and did a worldwide literature, which resulted in locating 2 articles. The one from Germany said that they found that irrigating the site of the infusion right after the infusion of the Taxotere, prevented the toxic burning from occurring. When I told the oncologist and the oncology nurses, who did the actual infusion, about the dermatologist findings, they replied that they see the discoloration all of the time!!! I can't understand why they did nothing about it, unless they didn't know about doing the extra irrigation. Therefore, my suggestion to all of you, who may be receiving Taxotere, please ask about the extra saline irrigation to prevent the possibility of discoloration. It is really ugly and I find I'm wearing long-sleeves to forego questions and surreptitious looks.",

After encountering chemo side effects and a post-lumpectomy hospital stay (which normally is not needed), I've decided to forego reconstruction after having my upcoming bilateral mastectomy (1 needed and 1 prophylactic). I just feel I want to get on with my life and eliminate as many new surgeries, worries, side effects, etc. as possible, and make as quick a recovery as I can. I was wondering how many of you have opted for no reconstruction, what your decision was based on, and whether or not you've been happy in your decision. As you all know, these are not easy decisions, but I'm hopeful and looking forward to my new life. Thanks for your help. Log in to post a reply",
