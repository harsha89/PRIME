The major drain did not hurt, and felt weird (just a tug and this sensation of something being pulled), but the secondary drain had been placed just below the skin and muscle area(?). I could see the line. Anyway, that one hurt! Sharp and quick but painful. I wish I took something stronger than the 2 Tylenol before my appt.   To say the least, my PS apparently likes to remove the drains out within a week after surgery. I was still draining what I thought was still a significant amount (40-50cc), but he wanted them out. I think I'm still building up some fluid and now am worried about the needle aspiration. Does anyone else have this issue?",

I was diagnosed in November 2011 and had a lumpectomy the same day you were diagnosed. In my case, all my docs thought that the tumor mass was under 4.5cm; unfortunately, it was clocked at 7cm. They took 3 nodes and they were all negative. So, I will have to go back for a mastectomy. Because the tumor size was so big, my BS recommends chemo for me. I am ER/PR+, Her2 neg. My MO and I decided to look at the Oncotype score irregardless, because like you, I am desperately afraid of chemo. Apparently, when the tumor is that size, very few docs even try for the Oncotype. I just got the score back and it was 15. The MO says \"no chemo\" and at this point, I am rather conflicted. So, we decided I should look into a 2nd opinion. I'm waiting for the insurance approval for that 2nd opinion consult and that is stressing me out. I think that if the 2nd opinion comes back with \"yes, do chemo anyway,\" then I may go ahead with it; my MO had already stated that she will give me 4 doses, if I agree to chemo. But, like you, the thought of permanently losing my hair will be a dealbreaker.  Good luck. ",
