As I was leaving, she walked me out and said \"it will NOT take 2 weeks for your doctor to get THIS report\", if she was trying to reassure me, it didn't work.",

My doctor is out of the office and I asked her what the report said. She said \"All it says is that the mammogram is inconclusive and an ultrasound is the next step\". There is a palpable mass. And the technician pointed out where the mass was on the image before I left. I wish I could just put it out of my mind.",

I looked at private clinics to see if I could get in earlier. But the closest is a 2.5 hour flight away. I'm in Canada, and although we don't pay for our Healthcare out of pocket, the wait times are ridiculous. This afternoon I checked the website that gives estimated wait times for breast screening, and it said the wait time in our province for a biopsy is 26 days. So even after the ultrasound, if I'll need a biopsy, it's going to take almost another 4 weeks. I don't know if my brain can handle all of those waiting.",

And I was told to follow up in 6 months unless anything changed.  Well, now my nipple is inverted, I have a feeling of milk let-down in that breast, and a lump that has tripled in size. I am tender all the way up into my armpit and I asked my GP if she could drain this, if it was in fact just a simple cyst. She passed me off to another GP who is concerned by the palpable mass and other symptoms, so after discussing it with the radiologist, they've scheduled me in for another us tomorrow afternoon.  I don't want to feel crazy, I liked the idea of having just simple cysts. But my gut says something else is going on. My breast is full of prominent blue veins, and I tried for 3 months to ignore all the other symptoms just so that I don't lose my mind. How can one boob cause so much stress?",

My GP is on vacation this week, but the second doctor I saw last week actually works at the hospital where the us is being formed. He said I could go directly to him and he will have the radiologist give us the findings right then. That makes me feel reassured. I'm grateful to have a family doctor when so many around here don't, but she sits behind a laptop and uses Google to diagnose instead of even making eye contact with her patients. Our healthcare system in Atlantic Canada is in a sad state. All the patients need to advocate for themselves. It's pretty frightening. Hopefully it will be all good news and I can have the cysts aspirated and be done tomorrow afternoon. Fingers crossed.",
