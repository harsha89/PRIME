If so, why do so many people have surgery and still wait for the results? I know I've had biopsies and been told what they were but not if it was cancer or not. On one of them she even told me there was a 20 to 40% chance of it being cancer, so I actually am set up for surgery. Confused. :/ ~Sunnysherri Log in to post a reply",

(Although my 28 yr old daughter has had an infected looking discharge at one nipple for many months now as I beg her to see a doctor ASAP.) I just had a mammogram, ulta sound, & then syeriotactic biopsy. Each test they came back with more findings. Such as; Sclerosing adenosis, Intraductal papillomatosis, (Peripheral Papilloma), duct hyperplasia, fibrocystic changes, extremely dense breast, & microcalcifications. They have told me I have been referred to an Oncologist who'll need to do MRI's with and without contrast then talk to me about \"romoval\" surgery. What?! And this is where they have left me standing. Scared and confused. Is anyone familiar with what these findings mean? I can handle straight talk and would appreciate ANY feedback I could get. Thank you so much. ~Sunnysherri ~Sunnysherri Log in to post a reply",
