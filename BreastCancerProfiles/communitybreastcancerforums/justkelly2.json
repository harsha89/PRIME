Will have 6 weeks of radiation soon and take Tamoxifen for five years. It has been a very easy protocol so far! I didn't start shedding any of my hair until about infusion # 9 and I would say I still have about 85% of it. Eyebrows thinned a little, still have all other body hair and eyelashes. My blood counts dipped a little below normal but I've still been playing tennis and working and haven't caught so much as a cold. Do not fear this treatment!
