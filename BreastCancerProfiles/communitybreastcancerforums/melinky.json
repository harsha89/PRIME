Ki-67 is one of the elements used to calculate oncotype score so it's likely that your oncotype score is going to be high too. My ki-67 is 45%, my oncotype score is 40, putting me in a high risk group. All 4 oncologist I talked to said I need chemo even before the result on the oncotype came back. There are several countries that do not use oncotype score to decide whether or not chemo would be suitable or needed, but the oncologists decide whether or not to do chemo on other factors such as tumor size, grade, nodes involvement, ki-67, etc. Since your cancer is an aggressive type and you have LVI, you might want to ask your onc if a radiation after a chemotherapy would benefit you. This is what I'm going to ask my onc next time we meet. I didn't know about radiation post MRM until I started reading about LVI. I thought if I had bilateral mastectomy I didn't need radiation.",
