It's a tough call; and there are many sites where one can find the extremely scienctific aspects and side effects which may or may not occur from cancer and it's various treatments. Indi",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2007 09:54PM - edited Sep 8, 2007 10:27PM by Indigoblue Hope you don't mind me posting on this site, as a triple negative hormone receptor; had Adriamycin, Cytoxin x 4, then 12 wkly Taxol treatments, and ended with 32 rads.  Instant menopause, chemobrain, taxol aches and pains, surgery complications, lots of other issues as my world was falling apart anyway.  I was never a \"sugar\" sweet junkfood addict. I will admit, love for pasta, veggies and potatoes; starches, good bread, but healthful, wholesome foods are my downfall and weakness.  There has been a huge, significant change in my stomach, brain, body cravings since the A/C treatments.  Something is chemically unbalanced, because I have developed an uncontollable need to consume sugar (in any shape, form, color). It's as though I go into a hypnotic trans, and if sugar is to be gotten, I'll get it, even if I have to bake cookies or jello, or walk 3 miles to a grocery store and buy candy, cookies, ice cream, frozen cakes, and chocolate (never liked it, ever!) anything, as long as it's sweet, the sweeter the better.  I never drank alcohol because of it's odor and taste, and found myself sampling the sweet liquors we've had for 20 years, and liking the taste and sensation.  I don't think it's the alcohol, but the sugar content is so intense. What the heck is going on here?  Are my brain and body now disfunctional and unable to resist whatever it is in sucrose, fructose, etc. that release dopamine of whatever it is causing this behavior?  It's absolutely crazy.  I'm never full after a meal, and if there isn't some kind of sugar somewhere, I go into maniacal fits.  Talked to the doctors about it, and they said this is a common problem with unknown sources... I wonder, has if the brain chemestry changed, stomach enzymes and lining, thyroid, lack of hormones; or if the cancer is such a sneaky little stinker, it controls the proteins and receptors in our cells to demand that sugar and sweets be served.  I always think I'll feel better, and it does nothing; I feel worse, and have gained weight.  Considering getting hypnotized or something.  I have no control over this absurd behavior...sugar, icecream, no sleep...peripheral neuropathy and extraordinary pain in the muscles and joints, spasms and jolts in the nerves; so many odd things going on, yet the doctors don't care to discuss the topic. Thanks for this discussion.  Truly thought I was the only one, especially since I never at sugar, chocolate, or goopy anything in my life.  Got extremely ill as a kid, and sweet stuff always repulsed my subconcious; never liked it, and now can't seem to live without it.  Worse than heroine? Yikes! Indi Thanks Helen, I'll try the B vitamins, heard they were supposed to help with neuropathy, so I took metanks B's for a while, no help.  Never heard about \"disolving\" the sugar cravings.  Was \"drinking\" maple syrup (100% pure) and through it in the trash.  That was a mistake, since hubby's normal and likes his sweet treats in small quantities.  boo hoo.",

I thought about taking a poll to see how many women suffered with symptoms of the \"unknown fibromyalgia\" syndrome, defined because it affects the soft tissues and joints. There is no test for this disease, and when rhumatologists, orthopeodic surgeons, pain management doctors, etc. cannot figure out what the disease is, they stick it into the generalized diagnosis of either Fibromyalgia or IBS.  I've always beeen informed that breast cancer is breast canceer, so on and so forth, but do they really know this to be absolute? Could it possibly originate elsewhere as it is undetected and microscopic? So often I talk to people whose cancer appeared from nowhere, but so often they felt ill, fatigued, and had symptoms long before a cancer was found.  My mother's was Inflammatory Breast Cancer, only discovered after she hit her breast on the steering wheel after her car ran off the road one icy, snowy night.  Woke up with a red ring around her breast. Father in law was told he had everything from hemmeroids to IBS, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerated Intestines, and ended up diagnosed with brain cancer.  I could list the dozens of people who fell into these medical categories long before cancer was diagnosed.  And all had soft tissue ailments, unable to find out the initial cause for their pain. A friend's father recently (was a long distance runner, always healthful lifestyle), went for many tests because his back was continuallly getting worse, always thought it was from the exhaustion of running.  His physician referred him to a specialist and they discovered he had mets all through his body; in particular, the soft tissues and nervous system.  Origin unknown, and he lived only 3 months. It seems to me there must be more to simply defining cancer as this kind or that; it's such a complicated disease with so many mysterious cases and types, sometimes with a full recovery, and it disappears for reasons unknown.  Immune systems? Heredity? Thank you for this discussion.  I, too, love research and science; it's interesting to have some ideas about this disease which aren't always in the \"medical books of absolutes\".  Indi",

I know it's probably not helping you to hear about my moans and groans, but sometimes it's reassuring when  you realize you're \"not crazy\" and that others experience the same side effects, fears, are somehow maintaining a positive and motivating outlook on life.

I will dress up like a cat, dog, or maybe a blackbird...in any case I will meowwwwwwwwwwwwwww, arffffff, bark, bark, hooowwwwwwwl, and purr when it's over.  Will know what's going on in this painful \"everywhere\" body, and in a way I \"don't\" want to know.  Can't think that fast, and my memory is like a bowl of mashed potatoes...with lumps and clumpy gravey.  Even my ears and eyes hurt, so who knows. Surgeon didn't even want to see me when I called, said triple negative does NOT recur locally, only distant mets in triple neg.  Ouch.  Did not talk to Oncoboy, but he will see me at some hour in the early friday morning.  This should be interesting since I never sleep at night and live in the misty groggy foggy land of chemobrain-o-pause.  Thanks so much for posting this information. I will copy down the notable treatments, and all the other information other women have posted here.  It's soooo helpful, since my back, hips, neck, you name it, it all hurts.  I hate pain medication, also.  Makes me sicker, really.  Even my skin hurts, and the thought of being touched is nasty.  I know how annoying and frightening this can be, and just pray you will find something to help your pain.  Thanks, you are in my thoughts and prayers. Breast cancer is so sneaky, why don't we ever get straight answers from many physicians?  It's enough that we must endure diagnosis, let alone not be given immediate, expedient treatment. Be well, and  take good care of yourself. ((hugs to you, and all who have helped so much)) Happy Halloween! Indi",

      "Content": "Oct 1, 2007 01:13AM - edited Oct 1, 2007 01:13AM by Indigoblue Mother6, Jo, Tender, I was dx with Invasive Ductal Carcenoma, Grade 3, Stage 1, 1.7 cm stellate tumor removed and SNB removed 4 lymph nodes, all negative for cancer; however vascular invasion (blood) was indicated, meaning or not certain that a distant mets. may occur. The SNB surgery cut some nerves, and the partial/lumpectomy mastectomy was 2.2mm from the chest wall.  I was told the tissue from the original mammotome biopsy had triple negative hormone receptors, meaning there would be fewer treatment choices and that it is an aggressive cancer which has few options other than adjuvant chemotherapy and Radiation.  Hercepton, Tamoxofin, and many other chemotherapy drugs do not affect this type of cancer, although the Adriamycin/Cytoxin followed with 12 weekly Taxol treatments and 32 Radiation treatments has shown effective results in Trial Studies. My surgery was performed Dec.15, 05, and I was told it went well, with clean margins.  Genetic Testing and the possible side effects, such as future cancer, Lymphedema, and nerve damage, chemobrain, etc., were never discussed.  Within the next few days I developed a \"Hematoma\" in my breast which is actually \"broken\" blood vessels.  It may have started after/during the original biopsy, or surgery.  It grew larger and  a week later it was the 4 x the size of the other breast.  It was painful, swollen, and infected.  Meanwhile, a sore armpit also began to swell, and it was as big as a large orange.  The surgeon told me \"it\" was a Seroma, clear liquid filled area which would also be re-absorbed by the body.  It also became infected, and I was forced to post-pone chemotherapy because of these complications. The surgeon attempted to drain them once he realized they were \"not\" shrinking, and was reluctant to do so because \"draining\" them could possibly cause poor healing and worse infection.  When he did finally \"try\", very little liquid was extracted due to the scar tissue and blood clots.  I went to my first chemotherapy appointment, later, and he wrote a prescription for some potent antibiotics, pain pills, and told me to gently ice the area.  I also used a topical aloe gell which I kept refrigerated.  Within 8 days the Seroma was gone and the Hematoma was 3/4's smaller.  It was remarkable.  My arm was swollen, but it was NOT Lymphedema, it was the nerves and infection from the Seroma and Hematoma; the nerves are still painful, and the Hematoma left behind a mass of scar tissue. Now that I have researched this side effect of surgery, biopsies, and Sentinal Node Removal, it's actually far more common than most medical personel are willing to tell patients.  I will also say, watch out for rashes, cellulitis, and other skin infections; I had a rash which my family physician tested positive for the Candidas Yeast Infection of the skin.  The Surgeon, Oncologists, and Radiation Oncologists all pretended not to know what this invading \"rash\" was and ignored my complaints.  I was given Diflucan and a Nystop powder for \"baby rash\" and it was cleared up within a few days. I think you should see your physicians, but be certain you have a file of information, a small tape recorder, and a copy of every report made available to you; legally, I believe it is within your rights to obtain a copy of these records. Lastly, get a 2nd opinion, a 3rd, and even a 4th if needed. Indi",

My typing is slow, and reading slow...eyes were affected by chemo. Brain drain extreme. Please bear with me, as it's difficult to express my thoughts, knowledge, and lack thereof. So glad to know you are here to help us. I am really confused about the lymphedemia issue, and when I ask onc., surgeons, radiologists, and especially cancer nurses, the response is always: You don't need to worry about L. since you had Sentinel Node Biopsy; but they took 4 nodes, dug around in there, and cut some nerves which after a year and 5 months have not returned to normal. Is high blood pressure, 159-170/90-101, swelling hands, neuropathy, swollen breast, (from partial, so called lumpectomy) minus 4 lymph nodes from SLN Biopsy, a concern for lymphodemia? I am confused, and yesterday (in response to the high blood pressure) my doctor took blood pressure from my surgery (left) arm. When I cautioned her she said, \"you only had one node removed, right?\". I responded, wrong... does anyone care? She's my fam doc, so okay, she has not been in the fold of the big hospital schematic team thing, and they don't send her important info, which I keep asking them to send her. Point is, the so-called \"team\" doesn't seem to care about it, and the big-wig cancer nurse acts as tho I am a hypochondriac when I ask about lymphedemia. The surgeon cut nerves, I had a huge hematoma the size of a small watermelon in my breast, and a seroma the size of a large apple under my left armpit, which was later cured with Cipro antibiotic. (all after surgery). I also developed a yeast infection on my skin, under, on breasts, arms, stomach, which was cured with nystop powder and diflucan. The response I get: You had sentinal node biopsy, so you don't need to worry about lymphedemia. After 4 x AC, 12 weekly Taxol treatments and mega doses of Dexamethazone Steroid (allergic to Taxol), Aranesp, and then 32 treatments of rads., 5 months later I have SEVERE neuropathy, joint pain, shoulder pain (extremely bad) and pain under and in my lumpectomy (partial mastetomy) left breast. Help. The high blood pressure is particularly disturbing since my doctor wants me to take medication. The shoulder blade, headaches, all this stuff just gets worse. Is it a sign of Lymphedemia? Should I seek help? Thanks for reading... and help would greatly be appreciated! Advice is truly welcome. I can't think straight, and the doctors and nurses have intimidated me beyond belief. Help!!!
