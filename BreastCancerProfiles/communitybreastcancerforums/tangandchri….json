Just curious...I've been given xanax as needed, but was't sure about this valium thing. Surgery is in a few days and I'm nervous, I try to keep myself busy so I don't have to think about it, but it always catches up with me. I'm nervous about being in any sort of surgery for 4-5 hours, it just freaks me out to be \"out\" that long. I'm nervous about how I'm going to feel physically and emotionally afterward too. This might be a dumb question, but I thought about when I had my last child and my milk came in my last day in the hospital. My hormones were all over the place and I was an emotional wreck, my baby girl wasn't nursing well and I felt like a failure...again my hormones were really kicking my butt. So, will have a bi-lateral masectomy effect me hormonally? I find it ironic that the last real memory I have of being the hospital was about my breasts, and now I'm going in again for my breasts. *sigh*",

I'm freaked out!!! I call the answering service, finally get a call back and PS has me text pics of my horrible looking flaps to him. He still says no infection, that the skin is going to eventually scab over and will be okay.

Maybe the dosage of your chemo is too much. IDK, but talking with them can hopefully give you answers. Grade 3 is the most aggressive and that is probably why the chemo has been recommended.",

To be honest, the book made me cry and even now when she wants to read it I have a hard time getting thru it. Best thing is to answer questions as honestly as you can at their age level, but don't give too much scary info. ((hugs))",

After surgery you will have more knowledge about your staging and a better understanding of how treatment will go for you. This will ease some of the anxiety, but along with that comes new stuff to worry about. I'm not going to sugar coat, this is all very difficult. I'm nearing the end of my chemo and I still struggle daily with all of it. Sometimes it is 2 steps forward, one step back. Somedays are better/easier than others, but slowly but surely it gets doable. It IS a new normal, we are adaptable creatures and you will get there too. Having kids just adds another dimmension to the fears we have. I have felt complete despair at the thought of leaving behind my children.

I am still on IV antibiotics for about another week and I don't even have my port placed. MO said if we had to we could start chemo w/o port and go back and have one put in, but she would rather not do that. I'm doing 6 rounds of ACT, and I'm so nervous. I just want things to come together with my doctors and get this ball rolling. ***edited to add**** Blood work came back today that I am anemic...10.9 and normal is 12.1. MO is running more tests to see if I'm deficient in something, but she said it could also be from my 2 surgeries. Will this delay my chemo or cause me added problems, has anyone dealt with this?  ",

Sometimes my head hurts more than others, but it has been steady none the less. I have felt off balance too at times and just off in general in my head. I know all of these symptoms could be anything but mets, but I'm worried. I had a scan back in June when I was in the hospital after I passed out after chemo. They saw something on my brain so I had an MRI and they ruled out mets then. My MO told me to stop the Tamoxifin I've been taking for a week to see if symptoms improve. I've only been on it for a month as it is...so I don't know. I see her next week for a follow-up visit unrelated to this, but I know we'll discuss it. Am I just being paranoid, are these symptoms at all consistent with brain mets? I'm freaking out to be honest. Any input is appreciated.  ",

It is on my cancer side but I can't figure out if the pain is in the actual shoulder blade or the muscle. It's an achy pain, but when I stretch my arm it hurts too. It seems to be worse at night and when I lay down the only way that doesn't hurt is if I lay on my back. I had a CT on my chest right before Christmas that was clear, but I don't know if this would pick up anything going on with my shoulder. Does anyone have insight on this type of pain?

The Celebrex was helping and when they followed up on the phone to see if the pain was improving, I said yes. But, now not so much...still have shoulder pain. Now, I'm having pain in my back. This pain literally feels like it is on my spine, it is a dull achy feeling that is fairly constant. My question is what does bone mets pain feel like? The shoulder pain is confusing because I can't tell if it is muscular or bone, it is actually my shoulder blade that hurts. But this back pain feels more like bone pain.

I'm going today to see the infectious disease dr and my PS has asked for a SED rate to be done to see if the there is still inflammation. Long story short, if there is inflammation he's going to take the TE out. I'm really getting anxious about how long it is taking, I feel like I'm putting off chemo too long and my anxiety is telling me that these cancer cells could be going all over my body.

My cancer was on my right breast and right lymph nodes, but I had a bi-mx. I have had several infections on my left side and have scar tissue like crazy. So, back in July I had what I thought was another infection flare up, but that was ruled out. However, since July I've been having pain on my left side. As of a week or so ago the pain has not subsided and I know have a lump area on my mid-chest area. I finally had a ct-scan friday and MO called yesterday saying it is inflammed soft tissue. She has said this is very unusual and they are going to compare scans that I had in June to see if it has gotten larger. I know it has gotten larger though, I can see it. She told me she can't rule out cancer and that likely I will need to have an open biopsy to see what is really going on. I'm scared and wonder if anyone has gone thru something similar. I'm not even really understanding what inflammed soft tissue means. My MO was talking a million miles a minute yesterday and I was left very confused. Thanks for reading.",

However, in March I went to regular doctor for something unrelated and had blood work then and the result was 10.0 and a couple of days later result was 10.1, my regular doctor says that up to 10.6 is normal....but MO says over 10.1 is high. So, I'm wondering if this is cause for alarm as I know what a high calcium level could mean. I emailed my MO's nurse on Thursday about and no answer.

I would have a needed inserted into my chest to drain the fluid and the doctor told me it was almost as if I had honeycomb like tissue in there. After the surgery it improved, although I did have a drain in for sometime even after that. Good luck, I know how difficult it can be!",
