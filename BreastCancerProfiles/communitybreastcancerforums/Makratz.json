Of course, I worry!  I will have another MRI and mam done in February.  I think the nire tests I have done and the more times they tell me not to worry - the better. I've heard from others who have never had BC that they have had calcifications show up on their mamos too.

Thank Nancy for that nice big mudslide!!!   My parents came over after my last boost and brought me a nice bottle of Baileys so.......I should make mudslides!!! It feels good to be done.  I'm not sure what I will do tomorrow at 9:50 when I'm supposed to be zapped, but I'm sure I'll figure something out. Rose47, I started Tamox this past Friday night.  I've taken 4 so far.  I will take them so I can further reduce my risk of recurrence.  I am 42 and NEVER want to deal with this again!! Ace1 - I get the same thing from time to time.  Hopefully it will end soon. Thanks so much for all the help and advice for each and every one of you!  I will continue to post here and also on the new 'about to start' thread.  Hang in there everyone else, your time will come!",

Hope everyone else is doing great!  Just a few more to go and the whole Sept group will be done!  YEAH!!! Thank you!",

From the front desk to the doctor to each one of you I am so grateful and proud of the job that you do",

Lisa, I'm sure you are going nuts and your imagination is getting the best of you. Your doc is doing these tests to be certain it hasn't gone anywhere else.  Isee you have IDC, were you lymph nodes tested?  If so were they positive? Do you have a list of questions to ask your breast surgeon?  Is someone going with you?   recommend they do because your head will be so full with info, you'll be confused and unsure of what he/she said.  Take notes, lots of them.  I assume they will do the node biopsy at the time of lump/msc.  Then they sent it out to pathology to determine what treatment you should have.  Hang in there, alot of your questions should be answered tomorrow. Luah, a breast MRI is just like any other MRI but your boobs get put through two holes and the MRI is done that way.  You lay down on your stomach.  No pain, just noisy!  Make sure they give you ear plugs.   I truly hope yours is nothing.  Remember 70% are B9. Good luck to both of you.  If I can help with your questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Linda",

I also have anxiety medication that I take as needed.  Some weeks I never use it.  But if I have a bad week (mams, mris etc) then I can take the med to help ease my mind.  Lots of women do that and it certainly helps.

You can get surgery consults and appointments really fast.  I was amazed.  I had my biopsy and was diagnosed with cancer 3 days later.  My surgery was 3 weeks later.  I also know people who wait  several months from diagnosis to surgery.  Every case is different and every hospital is too. It's important for you to remember that most (80%) of breast lumps are B9!  I'm sure someone with fibroadenoma will be answering you soon.  Hang in there.  Sending hugs your way.",

I went on vacation to NH, Squam Lake.  The weather was better, although we still got a fair amount of rain.  I would post pics but everyone knows that they dont show up here!  Someday I will put some on facebook.

I have gained 12 pounds since I started tamox.  I hate it!  I eat well, exercise and still gain the weight.  I also feel hungrier (sp) than before, but only certain times during the month.  I am premeno, still get periods,hot flashes etc. Maybe you should start a thread to just talk about ways to control our eating, get more exercise etc.  I was talking to Julz about exercising.  I read these threads while I am on my treadmil.  My DH set up a nice way for it to work for me.  So, if you ever see lot's of typos, which you will, it's because I am on the treadmil trying to type!  Hey, it's silly but it keeps me on the treadmil! I wish you the best!  You can do this and we can help!!  Good luck shopping! I try to do that too but still have to get junk for the kids.  That's tough for me! HUGS!",

I'm so happy to hear that you have made some memories with your son.  My son doesn't want anything to do with me now, which breaks my heart.  I know it's his age (14) and will change when he gets older, but it still sucks. I hope your job is stable and you keep on working.  Doesn't this economy stink?  Glad that all your stuff is moved and safe. BTW, love your pics, the screaming and such.  Sometimes we need to do that more than hugs.  Youa re very insightful! Keep checking in with us Mel.  I truely miss you!  I will keep you, your family and friend in my prayers.  Hang in there.  We love you!",

Cathi, still thinking and praying for you and Jacki. pgtbkm4, perhaps calling a local hospitals cancer clinic could help you?  I'm from Boston and I would call Dana Farber Cancer Institute.  They offer many services and advice.  They are very helpful.  Perhaps if you call them, they may be able to help you or point you in the right direction.  Sorry  you have to go through this.  What a wonderful thing for you to do.  May prayers go out to your family. Barb, Karen, Sheila, Fumi and everyone else, have a great night ladies! BTW, I heard that our sister Suecco has passed.  She's from the UK, I believe, just 38 years old. May God bles her and her family. DAMN BOOTFACE! Hugs to all that need them!!  There seems to be a lot!",

Barb and Cathi, I go down the morbid road too.  I bet we all do.  Sometimes I feel great and don't think about dying, but I usually go back to thinking about it.  I too was VERY catholic, 12 years of Catholic Schools etc.  My family still is, I just can't bring myself to go to church.  I guess I am mad at God too.  Sounds so silly to write that, but I did everything right, and here I am.   My husband does talk to me about dying, or at least listens to me.  I know it makes him feel very uncomfortable, but he knows I need to vent.  I think it's important to get it out, so we should continue to vent either here or at home.  Imagine all those people who can't talk about this with there DH or SO?  We are  lucky that we have AWESOME men!! I also feel bad when I complain about my health when I hear about others.  Let's take Barb for example.  Between you and your DH, you have a LOT going on.  Same with Cathi and Jacki.  Yet, both of you continue to come to these threads to make us laugh, share info, vent or just listen.  I think we need a group HUG!
