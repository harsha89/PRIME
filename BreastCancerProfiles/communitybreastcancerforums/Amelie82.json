I went to the British Hospital today (... where nobody really spoke English, go figure...) and all they did was figure out that I'm not pregnant. I brought up the idea of breast cancer, but it's difficult to have discussions like this when you're not both fluent in one common language. So she sent me on my way with a pain med prescription and a note to see a gynecologist. Good thing was, with my French insurance, that trip only cost me 7\u20ac. Bad thing is... I still don't know what's wrong with my breast and I'd prefer to catch this sooner rather than later if it's Inflammatory Breast Cancer. So can anyone here tell me if they know of an English-speaking doctor in the Paris area who would be familiar with it and check me for it? I really want to rule this out.... and then get my boob back to it's normal size.... :-P Log in to post a reply",
