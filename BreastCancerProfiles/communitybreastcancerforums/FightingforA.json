She also said there was some blood and lymphatic envasion. I am terrified. I am angry. I am depressed. I am overwhelmed. I just had a baby 5 months ago and all I can do is think of the worst. I have a bone scan, CT scan, chest x-ray, EKG, and lab work scheduled for Friday, and am praying for clear scans. I know that the largest mass in my breast is 5cm+. When you feel it, it's about the size of a baseball. She is talking chemo first and then surgery if the scans are clear. I'm hoping that someone else out there is in the same boat as me and can help guide me through this. I just don't know where to turn and am feeling hopeless. \"Life is not the way it's supposed to be. It's the way it is.

I have a 5 month old daughter and I'm concerned about how treatment/surgery will impact my interactions and relationship with her. I'm so worried that I'll be too tired or sore when I start chemo to carry her and worried about my recovery time after surgery. I know I'm jumping ahead, but I just worry that as she grows in the next year, that she'll somehow lose the strong bond that we have now because I can't be there in the way that I am now.  Thanks for all of your support so far ladies. This seems like a great source of support.  \"Life is not the way it's supposed to be. It's the way it is.
