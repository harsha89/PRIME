I was about 117 during this summer when I was diagnosed but not being treated for two months... Then, I was hit with the rads to my neck & hip....and soon after weekly navalbine and fasoldex... This happened until a clot broke off the tip of my port and because of the lack of attention in the er, landed in my heart. I was in the icu, etc.. They cleared the clot, I was re-started on treatment, but I was never the same...my counts dropped after 2 more rounds and I just couldn't rally.... I've largely been in a wheelchair since, I get so winded...and have such bad neuropathy. I began having issues eating... A few weeks later, I agreed to a lower dose of navalbine. That night I fell and within a week developed a sore throat and belly pain leading me to be hospitalized with severe nausea and a really horrible uti... Since then, I've lost ten pounds. I stopped the navalbine but I couldn't eat and hardly drink. Twice a week, instead of the hospital, I go and am infused with a three hour bag of iv fluids with a little sugar, zofran, pepcid and decadron. It took about 2 weeks to start being able to keep anything down. I'm starting to be able to eat again...but every couple of days, I end up sputtering... I think I gained a pound, but I saw myself in the mirror and was shocked how thin I am. I saw my doctor after his two weeks absence. He thought I'm on a suicide missiin stopping chemo. I said if food doesnt go in, then I'll end up in the hospital. I have no family or friends willing to help me and it is a nightmare to go to the er and be in the hospital by myself--staff picks on me... I suggest you ask your doc for xtra days of fluids. If course, I could run my own fluids, since I am skilled at iv, but this doctor won't leave me accessed or put an order in with a vna... I am having the fasoldex. Consultations with other oncologists have led to a debate about the bone biopsy results...and some docs recommend just the fasoldex, concluding it is hormone positive rather than triple negative. I take zofran, but I still end up feeling really naseous and my stomach gets all cramped up without the fluids.... So, it is helpful to have a little xtra padding, just in case. Hope that helps... One doctor tried me on marinol which is supposed to help with appetite, but it just makes me feel weird --.",

I went out and bought all his staff presents, him, too, and left him a $200 check with a note apologizing how sorry I was that I had been so out of it during our visit. I didnt get a response and I don't know what to do. I stopped one of the chemos because if I get sick, I don't have him to turn to.... why didnt anyone warn me that it is impossible to be treated for stage 4 bc without any support from friends or family?",

This hematologist threatened to discharge me if I stayed a patient of my other onc. So I quit the other onc and signed up for another one...I was put on a different regimine for a different type if bc....I fell fractured my sacrum, lost ten pounds...and most of my symptoms have come back plus... No good onc wants to treat me and the ones that do want to treat me for the old cancer, not the one that was from the biopsy.... Further, I see I was just going into remission back then...now they all tell me the best they csn do is keep me stable and they can't reverse anything... I ended up in the hospital with severe weight loss and dehydration.... I'm beimg blamed for this whole mess.... I've been left a basket case by earlier treatment and no supportive treatment during this phase for months....all to stay a patient of this doc I described above... Other docs were willing to take me as a patient until I fell...now I am soo ill and messed up and dependent, and scared, I don't know what to do.... The cuts to medicare haven't helped and because of my weak state and lack of support, I just can't get myself too far without completely falling apart. I take into account what the current oncs say, but when I look at the quality of my life now and six months ago and how frail I have bevome and how they've all clanned together to make it impossibke to get me stronger and healthy....I just don't know anymore.... I am very frightened... Thank you.... Thus man was having a bad day...I had to make a terrible choice...and I have tried to replace him him, but there is no one more skilled in my condition than him... Without the good onc part, though, I have a tough problem... I can't get around weighing less than a hundred pounds.... Thank you spam girl...though... Has time passed that quickly?",

No help grasping or coping with my diagnosis, etc. When I had side effects, like the lip dripping blood, the onc refused to do anything. Ended up with a clot in my heart. It was a tough winter. Changed docs within the cancer center but his nurses didn't coordinate any of my care within the hospital network and as I got sicker, I just couldn't manage. My weight dropped so much, my clothes began falling off of me. I tried to go see other specialists and doctors and even go for other opinions, but I started to get blamed for this whole mess and then, it got even worse... Such a mess...late last week, one of my regular doctors was so alarmed as to how I looked, he made me go to his hospital...I was totally emaciated!!! When they release me, I haven't figured out what to do because it is such a mess... in my state, each county is supposed to provide a social worker and provide referrals to services. They refuse, leaving the burden on me. One cancer patient can only do so much. I have tried to hire people to help me on a private basis and that has rather turned into a big disaster too.... I tried to go thru an agency, but they don't screen that well... Let me tell you...when anyone hears stage iv cancer in my parts, it becomes just an ugly feeding frenzy.....",
