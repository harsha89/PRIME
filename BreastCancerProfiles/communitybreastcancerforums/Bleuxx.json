I was diagnosed with DCIS in September and had prophylactic nipple sparring bmx in November 5th with immediate reconstruction. I currently have the tissue expanders with alloderm. I must say that they are really bothersome, but the thing that I would like to know are as follows: My skin around my breast and nipples is really sensitive and it's bothersome to the point where I am hunching over because I don't want the clothes touching my skin and it's affecting my posture. Has anyone else experience this as well? If so any ideas on how to relieve the sensitivity. I had a sentinel lymph node removed in my affected breast. My breast looks a little deformed and dented and the area around my armpit is still swollen when does this go back to \"normal\"? My PS said not to carry anything over 5lbs but I am due to go back to work in about 2 weeks and I work in a lab operating complex instruments and I have to carry things that weigh over 20 lbs. I am stressing out and I feel that this is affecting my recovery as well. I don't feel like I am back to normal. I get tired and wiped out easily. I am trying to push thru it but I feel like I am losing all my good attitude and getting depressed. Any words of wisdom would help right now. Log in to post a reply",
