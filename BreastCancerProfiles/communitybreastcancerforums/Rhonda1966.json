I was there two years ago and now that I have completed my treatment, I do not visit this board as much as I use to. However, it was great to have all these women to talk to and I will never forget how supportive everyone was. I tell myself everyday that there are many stage III survivors and I am gonna be one of them! And you will too! Hang in there ... it gets better I promise!",

I hope there is never any mets, but you can't help but wonder what the future may bring.  All we can do is trust in God! I wish you the best as well. Rhonda",
