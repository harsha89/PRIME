I lay there take my mind somewhere fun and remind myself the RADS are doing their job - good luck with all those in rads or just starting - I got a burn but it is managable and it really did not happen until going into the third week - and I am tired but I took advantage of rest times in the afternoons - I am looking forward to getting back to a normal life style again cheerz ladies it is doable!!",

Lucky me I think - I had the lumpectomy and recovered amazinly from the surgery - later the end of the first week I had an infection from hell (if you see any signs of infection get on straight away - it is horrible) so be careful and keep an watchful eyes for any signs - my breasts (I am small) are changed (my right breast (cancer and surgery) is indented and noticeable - but the tumor is out and I can live with the difference - I have traded bras for tank tops tight fitting and shelf bras inside - they are most comfortable - I have not yet started chemo or radiation my surgery was Dec 3 - but have my first appt on jan 7th - good luck - things will go well from your surgery - I felt great the next day.
