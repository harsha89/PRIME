Did have some days towards the end where I had some fatigue strong enough that I had to lie down and nap but other than that my skin is red but not blistered. Never thought my skin would look this good as I'm quite fair. The fatigue actually took me a little by surprise but hoping it gets better the more days post rads I get. Good luck to everyone finishing up! It happens quickly once you get the first week down. xoxo",
