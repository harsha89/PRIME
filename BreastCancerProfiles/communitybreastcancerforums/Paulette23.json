They thought I emailed a bunch of people ......when I sent ONE to the MD...it made them think I was causing pbms....I was attempting to get my record's corrected. when I called with a legitimate medical concern after surgery....the RN didn't call back. everyone was great untill the issues with the nurse and emails. I feel like they left me hanging with no ability to get assistance.",

It only takes one bad apple to make your treatment impossible. everyone else was FANTASTIC but this one RN made roadblocks for my care. Its sad how someone who has power between you and the MD can really literally kill your chances to getting access to the best treatment. both my hubby and I are medical professionals and are dumbfounded.....",

When I saw the oncologist he acted .....befuttled.since my onco test was dead center in the middle of the grey zone at 25 and I have numerous comorbilities.... it was not like he was confident one way or the other place for b chemo or no chemo. He finally....after much hmmmm...notable ....unsure confused looks....said he would recommend chemo and  it  would be four doses for the next few months 3 weeks apart.Because I have other health issuse I could see he was unsure.....would it be beneficial or harmful. . Because I am in that questionable grey Zone....this drug could worsen cardio....anther worsen neurophaties....another intersistal cystities.....but one may help autoimmune and lupus pbms..... I don't feel that he was confident whether I should or should not do chemo! So the ball is back in my court do I decided to chemo or not? I have multiple autoimmune problems which complicate matters  problems.  Then to complicate matters My blood test today show my liver function tests are slightly elevated and my kidney function test are  low......this is the first time I've had kidney function and liver show problems.I wonder if the radiation did this.... He pretty much left it back in my hands whether or not to do chemo. That is very frustrating not getting advice one way or the other because I am dead center in the middle of the grey zone.has anyone else been in this position not knowing which way to go? I asked about a second opinion and he said he felt that other MDs wouldn't say much different because of the complexity of my health. He wondered why Moffitt did not have me see their oncologist. ....so do I except that my hubby made remarks to see an oncologist closer to home. We are two hours away from them. Is it better to have an oncologist closer to home????? Do they all do much diff in treatments?  this one is  a mile away.....moffitt is 2 hrs....ai don't have much time to look around as I am 6wks post op now. The surgeon waited forever to set the appt...... I'm befuttled..... Many Blessings! !! In HIS SERVICE!!!!
