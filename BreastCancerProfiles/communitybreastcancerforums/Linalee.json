I am an artist who's still in the very scary diagnostic stage,( crying jags, worry, confusion), and drawing has been the only activity that takes me out of this horrible place in my life.  I put together a little art kit--a drawing pad that'll fit in my tote, a pencil case with a selection of colored pencils suitable for portraiture, eraser, sharpener etc. and I draw the people who are waiting like I am waiting.   Grandkid photos are good too for this escape; it's like they're there with you. I have to be quick and I have to be sneaky--people get nervous if it looks like you're staring at them a lot. The  focus required and the hand/eye action lifts me away so far removed that I've not heard my name called. Maybe you could knock down what you do and take it along to ease the time?  ",
