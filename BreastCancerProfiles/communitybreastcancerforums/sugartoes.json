I was seriously opting to have a mastectomy on my left because it was microinvasion and a lumpectomy on my right. Then I remember my aunt (mom's sister) who wished to God she had a mastectomy instead of radiation. I then decided, at the last minute, a double mastectomy. Because I had no lump, mass or tumor, just microcalcifications in both breasts and since it was high grade and left side was comedo (cells that basically have a mind of their own) and microinvasion on the left, I knew the right would soon happen too. Also, the cancer cells were estrogen/progesterone driven. Besides, it is extremely rare to have DCIS in BOTH breasts at the same time. After my double mastectomy, the relief was still not over because I had to see the breast surgeon a week later to go over the final path report of my double breasts. The right one (which I was thinking of having radiation) turned out that I had cells changing from normal to bad, (hyperplasia) and this time, it was not DCIS, but atypical lobular hyperplasia with adenosis. I knew in my gut that I did the right thing by choosing my double mastectomy and knew my beasts were nothing but junk. I survived the double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with tissue sparing and Alloderm with 250cc placed in the expanders right after the mastectomy less than 2 months ago. No areola or nipples. I look great and recovered in 3 weeks (which the time goes by fast). In 4 weeks, I was my complete self. I just went to a New Year's Eve party and all my friends said I looked GREAT and looked VERY HEALTHY! Yay! I will take their comments. :) You will make the right decision and only you will know what is best for you. You can so do this. YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS!!

I am in excellent health. I had my surgery 3 days ago, on Nov 12th at noon. I had worn a scopolamine patch behind my right ear the night before surgery to help with nausea and throwing up and dizzy spells. I was under anesthesia for about 7 hours. I woke up feeling okay, but when I tried to take oral pain meds, I would throw up. I tried a cracker, Jello and sips of water and still would throw up, but not a bad type of throwing up. I also burped a lot. I was given morphine for pain and Zofran for nausea by IV all night. Then next morning at the hospital, I was given Zofran (anti-nausea) by IV and waited for about half an hour and took oral pain meds, oxycodone. I had high BP for awhile because of the pain I was in. You rate pain on a 1-10 scale and I was always a 5 to 7 level. The oral pain meds worked with me not having to throw up by taking Zofran IV and then later was switched from IV Zofran to oral dissolving under the tongue Zofran. I took the Zofran a half hour before each oral medication to keep it down. I was given medications to buy before surgery: Oxycodone 1-2 pills every 4 hours for pain, and Ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours for pain and inflammation, Colace twice a day for stool softener, Keflex 4 times a day as an antibiotic, my amlodopine 1 a day for high BP, Bactroban for the drain sites; I have 4 drains, Tylenol 1 pill added to the oxycodone to add a little more umph to my pain management, and Flexeril for muscle spasm. Never to take oxycodone with Flexeril at the same time because it could put you out and you would have a hard time waking up. I had surgery around noon on the 12th and then the next evening, went home. I had stress going home because schools were closed and roads were icy in areas. I made it home. the first time I had to go pee, my husband had to pull my PJs down and pull them up afterward. I was able to wipe myself though. I was uncomfortable at home. I stood, looking at my recliner, and thought how the heck am I going to get out of this contraption. I laid on the couch. The third day it gets easier all the way around, pain management is better and moving around more is better. I still walk a bit like I am an invalid. I had a hard time flushing the toilet, turning on the faucet to wash hands, etc. Basically anything that you have to use your muscles. I am so sorry you have to go through all this.",

At age 27, I had another bump and this time, they tried draining it, but it was considered fatty and so an excisional biopsy was done and again, considered fatty cyst/tumor. Over the next 10 years, I had 3 more lumps, but these were able to be drained, not considered fatty, and the drained specimens were sent to the pathologist and again, cancer free. One lump/bump was the literally the size of a golf ball which the bump protruded out. I was told I have extremely dense breast tissue which mammograms usually do not show up anything which an ultrasound is immediately done. Ultrasounds can usually tell if there is a solid mass. So I had an MRI performed which was always questionable; nothing conclusive. Over the years, I developed HUNDREDS of fatty and liquid containing lumps and bumps. So, doing a self breast exam was completely useless for me. I faithfully had mammograms every 1 to 1-1/2 years for about 20 years and then by the time I turned 50, hormones changing, I had a mammogram and this particular mammo showed microcalcifications in clusters in BOTH breasts. Ultrasound immediately following showed no lump/mass/tumor where the calcifications were on mammo. Just hundreds of liquid and fatty cysts. I had a double breast biopsy which showed I had DCIS in both breasts with left side microinvasion, but no mass/lump/tumor, but hundreds of fatty and liquid cysts. Basically over the years, all my mammos and ultrasounds were compared to previous studies done and if radiologists see drastic changes, then you will be told a biopsy will need to be performed or further testing such as MRIs.",
