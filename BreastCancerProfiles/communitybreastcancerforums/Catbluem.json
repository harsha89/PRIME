My Mom, bless her heart, she went out and bought me hats, shirts, socks and sleep shirts that had breast cancer logo on them. I told her that she wanted me to be a walking bill board for breast cancer. I do love pink shirts just don't want to draw any more attention to myself as it is, I'm still bald, wearing hats and scarfs, I can't believe the how people stare at me. With it getting cold here I wish my hair would hurry up and grow back.",
