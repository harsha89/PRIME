Very fortunately for me, the doctors were making their rounds just at the time this happened.  This was an incredible stroke of luck.  I had to be resuscitated, suffered a heart attack, and kidney failure in the hospital. My reconstructed breast had to be removed, and I need to decide whether to go through another surgery just for reconstruction.  My recovery has been relatively good, but there were lots of complications: pneumonia, allergic response to the Cypro used to treat my pneumonia,, a seroma requiring a drain for 4 weeks, loss of appetite, night sweats, and depression.  I think at times I have PTSD because I have  alot of free floating anxiety, particularly in the mornings when I am waking up.  I did find a psychiatrist and a therapist to help me through all of this, and I am still going through some trauma and fatigue.  My cancer diagnosis was stage 1.  I want my life back. I am a believer in integrative medicine, and am practicing meditation and prayer to help me.  I am curious are there others out there who have experienced anything like this?  Are there resources or articles which could help me feel stronger and more optimistic?   Dx 11/17/2011, DCIS, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/5 nodes, ER+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I have been using the Healing Journeys guided meditations for PTSD, wellness, and cancer.   I believe that these guided meditations have helped me alot.  What a fabulous resource...  All of this happened to me in the good ole USA, in San Diego, at the NCI appointed Moores Cancer Center at UCSD. No-one went over what  happened to me, and I pursued therapy on my own.  I finally asked my surgeon, and he has no solid explanation.  If a mammary artery breaks. it usually happens right after surgery, not after 5 days in recovery.  Before going through reconstruction,  I would like to know what made me vulnerable to this catastrophe, which is reputedly, very rare. Previously,  I had 4 lumpectomies  --- two in 2008 and two surgeries in 2011 from which I recovered without incident.  The only lesson I can grasp is that life is sometimes very unpredictable, bad things can happen even when surrounded by great resources.  As you mentioned, the emotional side of this disease is such a bummer because one has to find new ways to achieve peace of mind.  I try to live in the present, count my blessings for now, and accept the cards I have been dealt. I do believe my survival was a miracle, something the medical profession cannot explain... my heart stopped and they almost gave up on resuscitating me, but I came back, perhaps with some help from the angels. I wish you the best as a survivor and contributor. ",
