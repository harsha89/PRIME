I had positive margins after my box on February 10th and went back in for another surgery just last Tuesday March 10th. Will find out tomorrow if they got the clear margins. Just wondering what they ended up doing for you? Did you have another surgery?",

We are trying to decide if I need radiation because I fall in the 'grey' area and I love how he was not afraid to send me to Seattle for a second Opinion. He set it all up. And if it turns out that I need it I will definite,y go with him. He is very caring and knowledgeable. Let me know if you have any other questions. Also if you need a PS, Dr Gabriel is by far the best!!!",
