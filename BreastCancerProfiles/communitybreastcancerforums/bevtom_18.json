    "Content": "bevtom_18 wrote: So for about a year or so ive noticed my right breast was slightly more darker in colour than my left. I am naturally very pale so I notice it a lot more but never thought anything of it. It seems to look more darker after taking a shower or being very hot in general. I have very sensitive skin also so I get patched here and there all the time. It's not at all sore, and my breast is slighty bigger than the other but not completely noticble. I've been reading up about different kinds of breast cancer, some of which I wasn't aware about but I've got myself into a state of panic, as I have a few symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer. Breast cancer does unfortunately run in my family, and my mum has just recently been given the all clear of it, and she is in her mid 40s. I plan to make an appointment with my GP as soon as possible but I just need a second opinion. Log in to post a reply",
