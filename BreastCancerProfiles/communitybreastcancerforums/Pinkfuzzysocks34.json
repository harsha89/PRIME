The tumor is too large to operate on (i.e., a mastectomy is the only option). When she did her biopsy, one lymph node was taken and it was found to have cancer. More will be removed during the mastectomy to see if they are cancerous. If four or more are cancerous, chemotherapy will be needed. I understand the process, I just want to know the chances. What are teh chances that all are affected? Did you have lymph node involvement? How many were cancerous?  Log in to post a reply",

The first thing I did was look up survival rates on this site. There are some listed for stage 3, some for stage 4, etc. The ones that were stage 3- does that mean that the cancer hadn't spread to other body parts (thus becoming a stage 4)? I don't understand how someone couldn't survive breast cancer unless it became a stage 4 first. God bless you all,  you're so helpful :)  Log in to post a reply",

They caught it early (she decided to have a mammogram after nine years of not having one). I'm just scared, ya know? She really had problems telling my sister and I. Fortunately, my mom and I have a very honest relationship and we agreed to always be there for each other.  The MRI is on Wednesday. What should I/she expect (I'm not going)? Since they caught it early, what are her chances of survival?  I'm still kind of in a shock. I haven't cried or showed any emotion. I guess I'm still just in a daze... but to me it doesn't seem that bad. They caught it early, they know what they're doing, and they already have a plan of what to do. Ideas?  Log in to post a reply",
