They are concerned however because my mom developed breast cancer at age 27.  I am one step ahead of you in the whole process I believe. I had a mammogram, then an ultrasound and MRI. I go in for a MRI guided biopsy tomorrow. I have been told over and over again that all these procedures are just cautionary and nothing malignant is expected to show.   As to your question about which diagnostic procedure is best : I have heard that MRIs by far have the greatest detection rate. They are very detailed and produce hundreds of images. The downside is they also have a high false positive rate (especially in young women with dense breasts).  I had my ultrasound done directly after the MRI in the same appointment. They used the ultrasound to see whether they could manually locate the bumps indicated in the MRI shots (they were able to find 1 of the three... which means my biopsy on that lump can be done manually and without the MRI machine..much more pleasant I hear). My doctors are being very aggressive with the findings.. so I'm lucky in that respect. But no matter what your doctors say...it's all about what will relieve your anxiety and let you keep on living without stress. If you aren't satisfied with the fibrocystic explanation, no doctor would deny you further testing if you requested it.  My thoughts are with you. On another note.. has anyone had any experience with an MRI guided biopsy? While I'm obviously worried about the results, I'm also concerned about the actual procedure and any bruising, scarring etc. Does anyone know what I should expect? Thanks all, Britni  ",
