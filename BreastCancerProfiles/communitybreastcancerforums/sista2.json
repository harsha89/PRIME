Deb - i did a lot of reading on the vit D thing also.  very interesting studies correlating to breast cancer.  if their results hold to be true then every woman needs to be made aware of the risk of being deficient.  i don't know my own (asked my onc, supposed to get tested, didn't, long story) but with all of the skin damage i have from overexposure to the sun during my life, don't know how i could have ever been deficient... yes i've been a sunbaker : ( .  and the swelling your having, i'm assuming it's water retention from the taxotere?  i started swelling up, the usual ankles and such but an area by my thumb too which gave me the lymphedema scare.  my onc prescribed a water pill which has helped and made me feel much better.  and the thumb area swelling went away too. Paula - that is awesome news on the dh.  i don't know how you don't stay exhausted with all you have going on.  and the hair thing...i wish mine had some spunk to be going every which way.  it's just laying there.   but it's hair and it's growing, so i'm happy. about the eyes - i was told six weeks after last tx for getting an exam.  man am i ready.  don't know how much of it is chemo and how much is just my eyes.  my eye doc, who is my age, tells me every time i go now, once we hit 40....i'm so sick of hearing that. have a good night jewels! sista2 ",

KathyL -  these reactions to taxotere have me concerned.  that will be my next poisoning after one more AC.  i was hoping for a little easier ride, especially since they will be every 3 weeks but it's not looking good.  you're almost done, that's awesome. Dana - you hold on to your positive attitude and don't let anyone bring you down.  great that you're finally getting on the road to fighting and yes, the prayers are real. sheshe - glad you found a doc you can feel good about, that's so important.  and no A in your tx.  that one worries me even being 43, good for you! deb - so sorry about your dp's mother.  there isn't much like the pain of losing your mom but, for me, knowing she wasn't suffering anymore and at peace was and is a comfort.  i hope so for her loved ones also.  on the lighter side,  yahoo for the last ac tomorrow.  every 2 wks is a bit**.  hope your se's are nonexistant. paula - maybe you've said, but do you know the cause of your cough?  i ask because could it be an allergic reaction? i've been getting a wicked sore throat a week after tx and an onc nurse told me it could be that.  i know it's not because i feel it in my ear too but can't coughs be allergy related?  when i first started trying to catch up with the posts, i was feeling horrid and thinking why am i doing this to myself.  financially, physically, all of it, it's horrible and my cancer is gone (?), they have found no more, why am i putting myself through all of this treatment?  what damage is it doing to my body for the future?  and then reading posts of some of you who were suffering some mental doubts and just sick of feeling sick somehow made me feel better.  not alone in my head i suppose.  thanks to all of you for that.  boy the road ahead still seems loooooonnnng. AND, heartburn - check, night sweats - check, omg they are killing me, i'm waking up with them constantly every night....trouble sleeping - check.  is anyone having trouble with finding things to drink.  especially after treatment when i know i need to hydrate, everytime i try to drink anything i want to throw up.  right now i'm drinking pink lemonade. flavored water, gatorade, done with them.  i'm running out of options. best to all jewels.  i need to keep up with you.  FUSE's to all!!!!!! ",

PAlady - i agree with the others.  you look great all ways.  definitely could do the bald thing! D1 and RN2teach - long story short...got my counts yesterday, everything low.  got a redblood cell booster and they said my neulasta hadn't kicked in yet for the wbc's.  i got that last friday and nurse said it should kick in any day now.  this morning when i got up my lower back was killing me.  it's not constant but when it hurts, it really hurts.  i've had back pain before and this is definitely different.  of course i've been telling myself all day that it's the neulasta and my wbc's are kicking a**.  we'll see if the pain stays, goes away, gets worse, whatever.  i have no doubt that it's from either the red blood booster i got yesterday or the neulasta.  hopefully the latter because my dh told me today he has a sore throat.  wonderful.  i immediately thought of you guys this morning and that you are RIGHT about the source of your spasms.  what's wrong with these doctors anyway?  are your spasms in your lower back? mouth care from my doc...1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda in 1 pint of water.  swish and gargle 3-4 times daily.  my tongue feels like a swollen fireball.  (could have something to do with hot and spicy chicken wings) ",
