The nurse at the hospital told me that a lot of women on TC treatment don't loose their hair but it does thin out.  I am hoping that I will be one of them.   It will be strange looking at myself without hair after having long hair as long as I can recall. But my hair grows like a weed and it is one out of several side effects that will all go away after the last treatment",

He did have cancer in his kidney and had to have it removed on June 30th.  He didn't need radiation.  I started my chemo  (TC) shortly after his operation on the 13 of July. We had planned on going to Denver this summer  for our Honeymoon but it will have to wait.  So to get to My Hair Story... I have had long brown hair for as long as I can remember.   I had read this book and it mentioned that taking flax seed might help from hair coming out.  I also listened to a friend on took  Biotin 2x daily to prevent it.  I thought that it might not fall out. Twelve days after my 1st  treatment, it started coming out.   Clumps in  my hands, hair all over the house.  My emotions were every were.  Up, Down and all Around.   I had a friend and her daughter who is a beautician come to my house. My husband and daughter were here and  watched as she shaved it on Wed.  What little that was left.  She made a braid and gave it to me to keep. I overnight expressed some caps that came in on Tue.  I have a long wig that looks like my hair but lighter in color.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep it on and wanted something to cover my head. The problem that I have is that hats or anything on my head often lead to a migraine. Very unconfortable for me.  In the winter I always wear earmuffs and not hats.  Trying to adjust to the new me.  Or is it the new me.  I think I am still the same.  Just have more life expreriance now.  Glad to have you all here.",

As I was moving something last night, I went flying hard onto my back, shoe fell off and phone went cell phone went flying across the room.  I was by myself at school.  Luckily, I was able to stand up and drive.  Came home and was hurting on my back & neck.  Took some pain reliever and thought for sure that I wasn't going to be able to move this morning.   Woke up feeling ok. Even managed to get some yard work in :)  Sometimes I worry that something is going to happen that will get in the way of treatment.  Never really thought about things like that before.  I have been bruising easily.  For some reason I have 2 bruises on my left hand and not sure if it is from the IV ?   Is anyone bruising.  I also have the strange redness on my right eye lid.  It comes and goes.  Kind of looks like a black eye and itches a little. Had a few hot flashed and my period kicked in my first week along with all the other SE.  I am getting to old for periods. Wishing they would go away!  The second week began much better.  One SE that still occurs is my toes will twitch as I am laying down or have my feet up.  Drives me crazy like a twitching in the eye. A friend gave my a yellow bracellett  that says  \"LIVESTRONG\". Something that I pray for myself and others each day. ",

Would love to know if anyone has had any bad side effects from a port.  I will be having to decide Port or IV.  The thought of both really makes me panic Looking for pros and cons to help me jump the fence on this one",

On Tues, my husband went in for a colonoscopy,  It turned out to be a very knee praying adventure.  It didn't go as easy as most.  It was terrible seeing him in suck pain.  I turned to God in My Angels to help us get through the day.  We made it home and he is ok.  As he was in the OR, I went to get my blood draw.  It makes the chemo day shorter when getting blood word done the day before.  She punctured a vein and had to go in twice to get the blood.  I got very emotional.  I tried to tell her the first time to heat my arm.  It makes it sooooo much easy to get a vein .  When I went in for my first treatment, the nurse didn't want to heat me arm either.  She said that  she didn't have the time and would have to get someone else.  From now on, I have a long discussion with the nurse that is working with me and know that if I don't put my foot down that I the heating wont' happen. I had a lot of heartburn last night and didn't sleep well.  Speaking of SNL.  My boss is a real joker and when I had to tell him about my cancer he made a joke about me being bald.  I told his wife that Pay Back is a Bitch.  I ordered a Conehead hat and will be going to his house today.  He knows my hair fell out and is curious about what I look like.  Will be lots of laughs tonight.  LOL Laughter is the best cure.  Shae,  One of my best friends has a son that has gone down the same path,  it is very difficult but I think he is somewhere where he can begin to make a decision and get the help he needs.  It is always baby steps gong down that road.  I hope and pray that  you can find moments during the day that will help you be a peace so that your body can stay healthy.  Have you looked into support groups that the hospital?  Just a thought. Well I usually ramble on Sorry.  The sun is out and I need to go get some sun.  Being outside is my escape from negative thoughts. Thank You All For Being Here. ",
