      "Content": "Kaimana wrote: Hi everyone, I have been referring to this site for insights and stories of others, over the past months since my diagnosis back in January. This is my first post (hope I am posting in the correct place!). I was diagnosed January 19th, 2016. I am 41yrs old. 3.8cm, Grade 3, Extensive lymphovascular invasion, clear nodes and margins. Right from Day one there was confusion as to whether I had one large mass, or if there was a large one, and a 2nd smaller one right adjacent to the larger one. In the MRI imaging there appeared to be a separate smaller mass, but in ultrasound imaging it appeared to be one mass, and that extra \"thing\" was concluded to be just a part of the main mass. They went ahead with surgery believing the ultrasound imaging. Thanks to one of my radiologists, a post-op MRI was recommended, to get a new imaging baseline, and to make sure everything had been removed. Unfortunately, rather than wait for the MRI results (my doctors were not expecting to see anything), I started radiation treatments and had just completed my forth, when my oncologist contacted me to tell me that extra \"thing\", extra small mass was still in there... it could be seen in the post-op MRI. Needless to say, I nearly fell off my chair when I heard this. Because I had already begun radiation treatments, they didn't want to interrupt this treatment, and decided the best thing to do was to complete the rad treatments, then give my body about 6-7 weeks to recover before getting surgery to remove this extra small mass - which at the time, they believed to be a mammary lymph node - which, it turns out it was *not* a lymph node, but another mass, that was 1.3cm. Had I not already started radiation, I think my surgery for this 2nd mass would have happened very soon after discovering it in the MRI. When all of this began, my oncologist said I was in the \"grey zone\" as to whether I would benefit from chemo or not, but given the pathology findings, all of my doctors were quite certain that I WOULD need chemo. Still, she suggested we get an Oncotype test done to help us decide. My score was very low, it was an 8. All of my doctors were shocked it was so low, given my pathology findings. Because of the low score, my oncologist said \"no chemo\". I was blown away, so relieved, since before receiving this score, everyone was so certain I would need to do it. My doctors have repeatedly said that my case has been \"complicated\". They have also repeatedly said how \"complex\" my imaging is. All of them have said this... not exactly something a patient wants to hear hey! But I appreciate their honesty. After my 2nd surgery, because of the complications throughout my treatment etc., they held a conference review to discuss if there is anything further that needs to be done or not. Summarized.... the oncologists were completely divided in their opinions as to whether I should now get chemo or not, something I had no idea would be on the table again. My oncologist said there is a \"huge discrepancy\" between my surgical findings and the low onco score. At the conference review, half of the doctors said yes to chemo, and half said no. We have decided to get an Oncotype test done on the 2nd smaller mass that was removed in July, to see if the score will come back the same as the first. Even if it does come back low though, it is a question of whether I believe this test or not. Quite honestly, the more stories I read from other women who also had low scores but despite that, had a recurrence has left me, personally, not having a lot of faith in this test. The more stories I read, the more it all seems to be a guessing game and a crap shoot. Another thing... they are uncertain as to whether or not the 2nd smaller mass was connected to the larger 3.8cm mass, or if they were entirely separate. I had clear margins from both surgeries, so I don't understand why there would be this confusion as to whether they were connected or separate. My doctor has asked the pathologist to try to investigate this and make some conclusion. (I guess if they were connected, then they might add those numbers?) Anyways, at the earliest, we are likely to receive the 2nd onco test results this week.. at the latest, next week. Still, at this point I am feeling as though I should just do the chemo to at least say, I have done everything possible to fight this. Oncologist said if I opt to do it, she would 'just' give me 4 rounds. Thank you for hearing my story... my health timeline of events is a bit loopy, I hope I have explained things clearly, apologizes if I haven't. I am wondering if there are many out there who were in the same boat as me... with a low onco score but had more aggressive pathology features?

Yes, that is completely true, and a sobering thought.. that the chemo might not even have an effect. I am running laps in my mind, going back and forth on my decision everyday. Maybe the results from the 2nd Oncotype score (which might come back this week) will offer a bit of clarity. thanks for your good wishes.... my best to you too! Cheers x @ beebs2704, Thanks so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it. Because of the low score (yet grade 3 and vascular invasion), my oncologist said she wondered if they sampled the correct area of the tumor, (I guess she meant the most active part of the tumor). Pretty sure my oncologist is leaning toward me doing 4 rounds of chemo... But at the conference review all oncologists could not agree.. Half said yes, do chemo, half said no.. If the experts can't even come to a conclusion, how am I suppose to!? Yes, I agree, these tests are not 100%.. Thanks for your help!! x (I see you're starting chemo on the 16th, wishing you the best, hope all goes well for you!!)",

The 2nd smaller mass was basically 'overlooked' in the beginning. Under the MRI imaging, it looked like a 2nd one was there, but they could not see it with the ultrasound. So they believed the ultrasound (in the beginning, before my first surgery). The 2nd mass is also ER+PR+ (but they were not able to discern if it was HER2- because of the radiation I received). I just looked at my pathology report - I see my mitotic rate was \"score 3\". I honesty don't even know what that means. (I had assumed it was related to the Grade of the tumor).",
