I got a call today telling me the most recent MRI and targeted Ultrasound is suspicious and now need a MRI guided biopsy and BC surgeon consultation. My question is wouldn't all these tests be able to diagnose or rule out lymphedema or blocked lymph nodes or scar tissue? I ask bc of symptoms, I really thought it would be related to my bilateral axillary breast tissue removal surgery. Now I'm not sure. I'm not asking for diagnosis but insight from personal experience is greatly appreciated! Thanks, Maiyre Log in to post a reply",

Does anyone know if this could cause inflammation , orange de peau and skin color changes? I'm waiting for a dr appt to discuss this with her. I'm just wondering if it isn't related, if I should pursue the skin biopsy to rule out IBC. I'm definitely relieved but still need answers. Thanks in advance for any help on this.
