My surgeon recommended a Valium before my biopsy (I'm 53, diagnosed March 2013; had double mastectomy w/ immediate reconstruction in May 2013; stage 2b w/ 2 of 3 lymph nodes removed, chemo started June & now on weekly Taxol for 12 weeks). Nurse at radiologists office asked \"do you think you really need the Valium?\" Ummmm - yes!!! Made me relax & not focus on what was going on, I so sorry for your very rough experience!!! Hang in there - praying for you!",
