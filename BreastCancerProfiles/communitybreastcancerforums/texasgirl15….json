I  just feel like, after reading so many stories here and on other websites, that enough is not being done and that i am politely being treated like some paranoid crazy lady! I'm thinking now of maybe getting a second opinion or maybe i am making something out of nothing. i do not know. i guess i need to think about it some more. i have the lump, then indentation and the only thing that showed up on any of the scans was an asymmetric density (mammo). i have not picked up the report for the last sonogram, so i will go get that. ",

He was not overly concerned about the lump, but slightly concerned about the indentation.  he spent about an hour talking with us about all the possibilities etc... He would like to see me get the MRI rather than the biopsy first. He said that he felt comfortable that if the MRI did not show anything, then we could hold off on a surgical biopsy. He went on to say that if I am going to still want the surgical biopsy, regardless of the MRI findings, then not to bother with the MRI. Soooo, I'm again conflicted and need to make a decision.  He did say that he got a call earlier yesterday morning from a radiologist that is starting a clinical trial for a new contrast material. Dr. said he would get more information  and if i am interested, the clinical trial would pay for the mri :)  we talked a lot about genetic testing. he would like to see me to do it, however i cannot really afford it, unless the insurance company is going to pick up 100% of the cost. further, i might go literally crazy if i tested positive, so i do not think i really want to know that information. my husband agreed that the mri was probably the better route right now. thoughts?",

Much more noticeable when i raise my arms up. thank you for your responses above. i really do not have a woman to go to now that my mom has passed. Grammy-yes, we are very upset about my dad's girlfriend. she is having the gamma knife procedure in the morning to zap the brain met. i have heard, and read, good things about the procedure, but she is understandably nervous. thanks again girls~ ",
