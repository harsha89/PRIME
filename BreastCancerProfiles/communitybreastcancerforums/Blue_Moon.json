      "Content": "Blue_Moon wrote: Hi everyone.  I found it a bit hard to talk to my step-mother about this, so before I will try to build up the courage, I think I could do with a little support. I have no idea whether I might/will develop breast cancer or not, but I'm worried. I read the list of symptoms and I saw that 2 of them include breast pain, and breast lumps. With the breast pain, I wasn't sure if I actually have that symptom or not, because my breasts hurt when they are put under pressure, not out of the blue. But with the breast lumps, I have two almost identical lumps in either breast. I'm not sure if this is odd or normal, I just thought I should say it to let you know. As said before, I need a little support, and I also need a little help with confronting my step-mother. (There is absolutely nothing wrong with her in any way. We have a perfect mother/daughter relationship and we get along as if we are blood related. I love her very much, I just don't know how to let her know.)  Thank you for your comments.  Log in to post a reply",
