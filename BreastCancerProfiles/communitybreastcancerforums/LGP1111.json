      "Content": "Feb 8, 2014 04:23PM - edited Feb 8, 2014 04:23PM by LGP1111 Hi all, I, too, am a newbie. Â It started as Stage 1, then 2b after my lumpectomy, and now after my recent mastectomy, it's Stage 3a. Latest pathology showed more positive nodes and negative (but close) margins on removed tissue. Now I'm confused if this means more surgery (what more can they remove after a mastectomy? Muscle?) or sticking with the original post-surgery plan of chemo/rads/hormonal therapy. So hard to deal with the fear and the unknown. I feel physically strong and ready to claw my way up from rock bottom, but rock bottom keeps changing (kind of like an elevator that keeps dropping without warning). Trying to adapt a new mindset that centers on the following - perspective, gratitude, patience, kindness, and absolutely living for today. A particularly hard part of my experience is having just lost my mom to ovarian cancer about four months ago, but in a way, I'm glad she never had to know about my diagnosis. As a mom of two young boys, I know how much you love and would do anything to protect your children. Thanks for letting me ramble. I so appreciate not feeling alone and being able to learn from others - truly grateful.",
