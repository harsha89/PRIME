    "Content": "sherri89117 wrote: I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma a  week ago.  They say it was caught early. Just saw a surgeon. I am more confused then ever. We talked about lumpectomy with sentinel node removal followed by radiation. Then he brought up mastectomy and the reasons for it. But I am afraid of all of it and  can't decide the best route to take. They are unsure if the cancer has invaded my lymph system but the Dr. doesn't think so. Any advice on which way to go? Does any one know if you can weight train after a senteniel node removal? Log in to post a reply",
