      "Content": "May 27, 2015 03:57PM - edited May 27, 2015 04:27PM by Kniterly I haven't posted but have been reading everyone comments. I started chemo in April, taxotere and cytoxan and had quite a few side effects so my MO decided to break up the taxotere into 3 doses. First week cytoxan and 1/3 taxotere, next 2 weeks 1/3 doses of taxotere. Anyone else on a plan like that? Today I finished part 3 of second round. Nurses weren't sure if I get next week off or if I will go right into 3rd round and if I'll end up with original 4 round or an extra 5th round. Right now they said it looks like 5. A little disconcerting that no one was sure and dr was out for the day. Side effects have been better overall except for fatigue I have several autoimmune issues that were why she felt like SE were so extreme (Joint pain, mouth sores, skin on hands peeling off, etc).Just curious if anyone else has had this schedule?  Gina. Just checked my \"My Chart\" with the drs office and I do NOT get a week off. Still not sure about length. Was supposed to be 4 cycles but MO said 12 weekly visits so that would be equivalent to 5. anybody",
