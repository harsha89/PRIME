I guess I felt a bit silly/ embarressed  too and I know I shouldnt have but it takes me a lot to even go to the doctor but never mind put it down to experience :) I too am from a nursing background which is probably why it got to me so much. Thanks again and I wish you all the very best take care xx ",

I found a lump in my left breast about 8 weeks ago and because I have had a hysterectomy I waited 4 weeks just to see if it was hormonal or anything. I went to my GP and she could also feel the lump but thought it was a cyst if anything and sent me for an ultrasound and mammogram, my first I am 49. I then developed another lump much higher up level with the top of my arm pit but on my chest if you can understand what I mean.  I went for the scans  yesterday. Going by what I was told and after the doctor felt the lump/s said it is nothing to worry about just normal tissue.  Dont get me wrong I am very glad it is nothing but what worries me is how do I trust my own judgement to me it feels like a lump quite different to any other lumps in my breast which is why I watched it for a while before going to the doctor in the first place. The girl doing the mammogram was lovely but the one with the ultrasound was quite dismissive as if I was wasting her time and yes she did call the doctor in and all he seemed concerned about was that I use one finger to show him the lumps! I also felt bad that if this was the people who was telling other people that there was anything wrong how horrible it must be for them. Anyway as I said I am really glad that I am fine guess I am just a little confused on how to tell in the future if anything I feel is normal tissue again. Thanks for letting me share and this is such a wonderful site thank you   Log in to post a reply",
