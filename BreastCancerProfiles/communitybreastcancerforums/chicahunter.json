Keep in mind that the biopsy (usually accurate) can miss a part because it's small pieces taken in a circular form of the mass. Not to scare you or anyone but I feel it's important for us to know our bodies & not expect doctors or diagnostic tests to be 100% accurate. My gut tells me to further investigate & lowery chances. That means undergoing a lumpectomy or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy if my BRCA1/2 comes back positive. A high percentage of breast CA is sporadic & not related to family history so be aware of changes in your body & do what you feel is right for you & will give you peace of mind.im in the process of doing the sane. Prayers to all.",

I've been toggling back & forth with doing nipple sparing (because its less down time & only 1 big surgery) but because my breast are a full C & very dense I'm going to stick with skin sparing. I've participated in a lot of these surgeries & you are correct in saying there is no rule it's very individual & the surgeons play a vital role.  Speaking of surgeons, yes I did the \"if I was your wife/daughter etc\" to which he replied \"I'd tell you to do what you feel is right for you\" lol then I tried \"ok what if you were in my shoes\" he said \"but I'm not\" lol there was no way I could lock him down into a decision. As for my hubby, he's just worried about my intolerance for pain & how I'm going to handle waking up with such drastic change to my body. I know in my heart everything will be ok.",

The one thing Im not to fond of is having the implants ontop of the muscle because you tend to see the implant move & look like balls sitting on ur chest with dimples on the sides where the striations are. Thats not saying all patients who do the one-step look bad or that all surgeons put the implant ontop of the muscle instead of underneath. I'm in a university hospitall type setting so even though they pride themselves in cutting edge technology they tend to be on the conservative side. I was told by my BS & PS that removing the nipple is best to eliminate CA risk & complications of necrosis. They said the expanders are best because you can move them & tweak the position plus the risk of encapsulating is none. Oh yeah & it's alot less painfully because your muscle is slowly stretching with expanders where with the implant it's all at once bam! Oh & if you have some sagging (we all do) that won't be able to be corrected unless you reposition the nipple. Hence I'm knocking off 2 birds with one stone, reducing CA & lifting breast. People think doing nipple sparing will save the nipple sensation but this the furthest from the truth. The benefit of one-step is one surgery where incision is in breast fold (where the underwire is) & that's it but if your a title uneven or sagging then ur stuck having revision surgery. I'll just reduce chances of redo's & do the 2 surgery step withTE's. I'm scheduled 4/30/14",

I will be scheduling my PBMX w/reconstruction for the end if April 2014 but I'm doing the 3 step route starting with expanders. I'm a scrub nurse & have assisted on many of these surgeries & this is the best outcome. My husband is understanding but doesn't quite agree, he wants or needs a more definite answer that I'll eventually get breast CA or for the surgeon to clearly say \"I recommend ur wife having this surgery\" all things no good surgeon will say. Thank you all so much for being so open & honest, I've learned a lot. Prayers & blessings for all.",

I've been in the medical field for 25 years, have an extensive family history with different types of CA's (Breast CA included)including colon & cervical CA for me starting at age 27. I've been CA free so far & am 43 years old. Last monthy during a routine mammogram 2 nodes in my axilla along with some calcifications in my breast was seen. Being that I have very dense breast I wasn't worried. Things progressed & I ened up having a MRI guided biopsy with & without contrast showing a mass was found on my left lower quadrant measuring 1.9cm. I'm waiting for the results on my genetic test BRCA1/BRCA2 to see if I'm positive. Here's my dilema, I have 2 friends that also had negative biopsies & were negative for the BRCA1/2 but when they went for their lumpectomy pathology said the mass was stage II BC!!! I've seen my surgeon to discuss my options of a bilateral mastectomy with implants because of my family history (both grandmothers Breast CA, mother lung & cervical/uterine CA, aunt breast CA) & he even states that my breast are extremely dense & that I have a 25% chance of this fibroadenoma converting into CA at a later date but that this is a major life altering surgery I need to think of. The genetic counsellor tells me that even though I have a high family history of CA he thinks I will be BRCA1/2 negative leaving me at a 25% chance for Breast CA and increasing as I get older. Surgery is not my fear, chemotherapy is. My gut tells me they missed it in the biopsy & there are other masses they haven't seen. I'm not anxious, nor paranoid however I can't help but feel strongly like I have granades inside me just waiting for something else to set them off. What should I do? Right now I'm just waiting on genetic testing to come back but that will only tell me if that particular gene is in my DNA, the other percentage is spontaneous.Guidqane, clarity, advice or a slap in the face please, just help me figure out which way to go..... Thanks Log in to post a reply",

To answer your questions, yes I had an MRI w/contrast that found the \"fibroadenomas\" I say that in quotes because the report stated \"fibroadenomas due to hormonal changes\", they thought it was during day 3-5 after menses but I'm premenopausal & had been bleeding on & off for 18 days, plus my bloodwork showed low ferritin, WBC slightly elevated & anemia (7.9), then had an MRI guided biopsy with & contrast to confirm mass. The 25% came from my genetic counseler & my oncologist because of my CA (colon & cervix at age 27) & strong family history. My maternal grandmother had lumpectomy first then during surgery got a stage IV diagnosis after biopsy being also fibroadenomas. This is one if the reasons I'm concerned. I know PBMX is a huge decision but the surgery doesn't scare me as much as needing rounds of chemo. My thought is if I can significantly reduce my odds without needing chemo then it's worth it. I'm gathering all info & getting a 2nd opinion while waiting for genetic results. I'll check on the P53 test. Thank you again for the great advice & support. I don't think anyone entertains the thought of a PBMX as an easy simple choice. Atleast they shouldn't.",
