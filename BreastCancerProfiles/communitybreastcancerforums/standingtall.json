I would like everyone to know what a true blessing each of you have been. I was able to read, learn and actually formulate questions to put to my many doctors as this process progressed. I will never be able to repay you for the information you have all shared. I have just received information back from the latest biopsy- excisive- that said I do not have cancer. But as my surgeon told me that does not mean I may not have it in the future. I truly believe that without the postings and the encouragement this process of waiting and not knowing would have been 100 times more difficult. I know there are many people out there who are like me, too shy/scared to do more than just read and read and read and find hope in what you brave ones were willing to share. Thank you forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
