Will you have rads and will it start after the driving restrictions? Dmjmom and leatherette hope last night was restful. Strangely the steroids don't give me that burst of energy, I do feel better with them just not the boundless energy. The upside is though it doesn't keep me up at night so I always get a good nights sleep while on them.

I would say I've felt as good as prechemo except for some shortness of breath that just persists. Fatigue did improve though. So on to Taxol on Monday. I'm ready to get going, been dreading the unknown of a different drug, but got to get through this. Jen, I see you start right behind me. Hoping it's easier than AC for us all. I've not had any pain from neulasta and since I have to continue it on DD, I'm hoping that continues. Pink. Good grief I would be so mad if they switched my appointment without telling me.

She'll have a peaceful passing, a blessing for you all. Runnermum- my hgb had hovered at 12 through AC then at the start of Taxol it took a big hit and dropped to 11.1. I was concerned as my normal s 14+. I'm sure this is where the fatigue is coming from. My MO said chemo hits the bone marrow and that means our RBC and WBC. Our WBC recover and make new ones quickly, but RBC take 120 days to mature. So they start to regenerate right away after our first chemo infusion but won't be mature and released for essentially 4 months. So we won't see any improvement till November in RBC. However we can try to increase our Hgb (iron) through diet. MO says they will not infuse till hgb hits 8.0. Good grief not sure how I'd still be on my feet with it that low. My MO and the cancer center I go to are very open to alternative therapies, but I've read on here that many are concerned about any interference from supplements etc, who knows. I think with all that medicine knows, there's so much it doesn't know. I asked MO last week why abraxane isn't used instead of Taxol, she said only because all the trials so far on abraxane have been in the neoadjuntive area and since all the info is on that and not adjunctive applications she and other MO's don't use it. Hopefully that changes soon. ( abraxane is taxol, but dissolved in a different solution. It's the solution it's dissolved in that causes all the allergic reactions in taxol) They have limited research and until its studied no one wants to take a chance, even with vitamin supplements. I'm sure if I were an MO I'd be just as careful with my patients, we just need more research. Have a good day, off for my prechemo labs today, only two more to be drawn till I'm done. Woot!

We did a little Christmas shopping, ate at our favorite restaurant and went to the movies. So I'm in the chair for my 3rd DD and have a couple hours to go. This place is packed today, good grief the noise level is crazy! Somehow my hubby has fallen asleep in his chair. Then again he's been known to doze standing up if he's propped against a wall. The ball and toes of my feet feel odd if I walk barefoot, I don't notice it if I have on shoes or slippers. Must be neuropathy. Well my energy level is all over the place. I definitely felt low on day 8 and 9 this past infusion, then the rest of the week was fine, I got the house cleaned, shopped and ran errands. But this morning I was getting things ready for our lunch at the infusion center and I just wanted to go sit down in the worst way. That works as this is definitely a wasted day hanging out here. My daughter is home till tomorrow so she's volunteered to have dinner ready when we arrive home. Yippie! I'm sorry for all the fatigue, I know it's depressing as the couple days I was feeling puny last week my mood plunged also. I know better days are coming though, hang in. Purple, woot your done in a week! I'll be right behind you a week later! Proud, your onc wants to review your presurgical scans but feels the two (your cancer reoccurring and the operation) aren't related. Makes sense to have them available I would think. Paulette I'll send you my info for the fb group. Thanks so much. Hugs and prayers, Theresa",

Is this the first time you've gotten them or is it every infusion. Plus it stinks that this is your supposed good day. The only thing I can offer is every infusion is different and hopefully this is a bad one and the one coming up is going to be better. Hang in, just offered prayers for you to feel better. You are right about the pink ribbon stuff, I had a neighbor, who is a nurse, tell me when she heard I had breast cancer, how lucky I was because it's not really a serious cancer. I just stared at her, I had nothing in response to that! Ok, so there's this thread called slices of joy and I check in there every day. The gal who started did so to post the little things that bring joy into her life. It's a fun thread and you may like it. Anywho, I thought I'd end each post with a little thing that brings me some joy. In college my hubby and I were normal students, studied last minute and wrote papers at the last second. We were the worst procrastinators. The worst, I would clean out my cats litter box to delay homework. Anyway, the thing that brings me joy is my daughter is the complete opposite of us, we don't know where she came from and we plan to keep our dirty secrets from her, at least until she graduates this spring. She has no idea what bums we were. 😂 Makes me smile",

I'm relieved you're not devoting 3 hours a day to the pump, that seemed ridiculous. Especially in light of the PT and the Dr I go to for this both said the swelling is so slight they're not sure it's lymphedema at all. They both feel it's related to the chemo and will disappear altogether. so I'm going for once a day in the evening and see how that goes. Proud, I found the sight, thanks, tons of good info. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ Sunny, you get your MO to write the order and then the PT will measure and order it. Leatherette, about a month ago, I had what looked like bruises under my eyes, ugh I almost wanted to hide, somewhere along the way they disappeared, I was afraid they would be there till chemo ended. I wonder what causes them? Paulette, I'm so glad your feeling better, you sounded so down and not yourself at all. Yay for Pepcid AC! Dodgersgirl, ouch, I hope the swelling goes down quickly. I had a small cord that went away right before my first PT appointment. It was the oddest thing, I couldn't raise my arm above the level of my shoulder without a bit of discomfort, then I get up one morning and I could. It was a little stiff but that worked out in a day or two. I was relieved because when my rehab Dr was feeling around to detect the cording, that hurt! I was dreading the manipulating the PT was supposed to do. Prayers said that the cording releases quickly. So this morning I woke and realized I'd slept straight through the night. Woot, that's a rare occurrence! As I was laying there I heard the heater kick on and it was so pleasant being in a warm bed and knowing it was quite chilly outside. I love the coziness of fall, the fireplace on, chili on the stove, drinking hot tea or cider. I keep the feeders full because the birds are much hungrier, especially after a cold night. They're all puffed up and jockeying for a spot at their favorite feeder. Not much planned for today except we're having dinner with my son at the new IHOP up the street. I'll take a long walk again today, and who knows maybe I'll sleep straight through the night again tonight. Hugs and prayers, Theresa  ",

Pink, My neuropathy is ever so slowly improving. It's a good thing this was my last infusion, it was quite a bit more severe this time and I would be afraid to see what one more dose would do. Unfortunately fatigue takes a bit of time so I guess the next big SE I'm hoping to see decrease is the shortness of breath. Maybe by Thanksgiving (ours is late Nov). As an aside, I wish our Thanksgiving was earlier like yours. It would be so nice if it wasn't so caught up in the Christmas shopping confusion. The fluid/hydration thing is so important and I know I made the same mistake on my last AC. I woke up the day after my infusion and knew this day was going to be hell on wheels. However I then knocked off my neulasta pod first thing walking through a door. At first I was mad to have to make the 2 hour drive in to get the shot. Then I thought how I could get a bag of fluids while there and it might help. Halfway through the bag and my nausea was gone and my energy returned, by the time it was all in I was starved and we drove straight to eat. It was like a wonder drug. My husband just left with a list so I can make a big pot of chili. It's his favorite thing in the world and I like to have it in the freezer. Today is cool and will rain all afternoon, the perfect thing for dinner. Well I need to jump in the shower, have a great Saturday with minimal SE. Hugs and prayers to all, Theresa",

Quite a bit more gray, but I'll take it! Today is rad session 26/30 and my first boost. It's going to be the scar line and my axilla. So far my skin is dry, flaky and itchy, also quite red and tender. I'm having a little more stiffness in my shoulder, and a small increase in swelling in my arm, so I've added another hour on the pump and some stretches my PT gave me. It's all helping. All in all I'm doing good, a little uncomfortable, but every morning I get up and say, \"this is manageable.\" Heading to lunch and a movie after rads with my daughter and hubby.

I also start on the 10th, mine is later in the afternoon and I live about 2 hours away, so I'll report how it went later that night. If you feel up to it I'd love to hear about your day. Mimi - is this like a epsom salt dry scrub? I'm not sure I get what it is. So you put the salts in the sock and did you scrub your feet like a pumice type thing? Then rinse? I bought a large bag of epsom salt and have it on the side of the tub, have read all kinds of uses for it here. Also, your feet and hands brown up a bit. I hadn't heard that. Sigh!

I go this morning, they said NPO after 6am so I got up at 5:30 to have breakfast and to get in a bike ride. Then off to the hospital by 8:30. Because of traffic we allow 2 hours, but if we're lucky with light traffic then we end up there an hour early. Ugh I have to remember to mark where my bra straps hit this morning when I get dressed so it doesn't end up under a strap and rubbing. Jen I hope you had a comfortable night. The dr said I could take an Ativan she'd prescribed the night before the port placement and chemo to get a good rest. I've never taken anything before. I had gone to bed early to get enough sleep. Was just lying there debating should I take one. Eventually got up and took half and was nervous as can be what would happen. What happen is I fell asleep till midnight, so I got up and got the other half and had a full nights sleep except for those few minutes. I just don't want this stuff to be a habit, But I understand that excessive worry and getting run down from too many hours in the middle of the night worrying over everything is really bad too.

I also was somewhat anxious about the procedure because of a previous bad experience 30 years ago. I absolutely wanted on the heavy side of sedation. But in the end, I reacted to the combination versed/fentanyl sedation and they stopped it right away. I ended up wide awke and talking to them. It went fine. I also had an interventional radiologist. I would go with your MD's preferred method as he feels things turn out better for his patients that way. However if you have a lot of trouble with general anesthesia you can ask for a referral to a doc that would do the sedation. I feel bad as this is just one more wrinkle that's making it all hard for you. Ping pong - your center sounds really nice. Mine is a large research hospital, and even though I like the Drs and nurses, am in a clinical trial and feel very confident I'm getting the best care in this area, I have to say that the infusion center itself is the pits, ugh. I also drive 2 hours to get there. I take a yoga class for cancer patients here in town at the local infusion center, and it's a most beautiful and comfortable place, not like the one I'll use We're all grateful you decided to post here with us. Matryoshka and she good luck tomorrow on starting chemo, prayer said for a uneventful smooth infusion. Post when you feel up to it. Well I woke up with a red puffy area the diameter of a lemon around one end of my incision. This is the first hiccup since surgery which was 7 1/2 weeks ago. It's healed beautifully. So this afternoon we're heading back to see the surgeon. A four hour round trip! Sigh I so don't want to do this today, but chemo starts Monday and I don't want any delays. Such is life. Theresa",

So right now the Ativan and Prilosec are working. I'll take it Pink - thank you for the link. Today was a good day and was able to put in 45 on treadmill at prechemo pace and 5 miles on the bike. Oh how glorious to feel almost like my old self, if even only for the next few days till infusion #2. Emily - yup the water and the walk, your doing the right stuff. Let us know how tomorrow goes.

Hoping for an early turn around day for you. Hugs. Leatherette- we'll take the good days as they come. We really live in the present during chemo, but that's ok as it's really only short term.

I found this book \"the cancer fighting kitchen\" and it has a lot of great tips. Here are some \"fixes\" the author made for taste bud troubles during chemo. Have no idea if they work but hope they do: Too sweet - start by adding six drops of lemon or lime juice. Keep adding it in small increments until the sweet taste becomes muted Too salty - add a 1/4 tsp of lemon juice. It erases the taste of salt Too bitter - add a little sweetener such as maple syrup Tastes like cardboard- add sea salt until the flavor of the dish moves to the front of the mouth. A spritz of lemon juice also helps. Metallic - add a little sweetener such as maple syrup, and a squeeze of lemon. You could also try adding fat, such as a nut cream or butter. Hope that helps.

That's my hubbies struggle, he'll call 3-4 times with every grocery run. Sigh! But your neighbors a god guy, glad he's doing this, every little help is so appreciated. The weird pains with Taxol started last night around 9pm. Took a couple of Advil to keep it in check cause I was heading to bed at about 10. It wasn't bad, annoying is more like it. While awake and occupied I could just ignore it. Once in bed it was more difficult. However I meditated with my rosary and must have fallen off pretty quick cause I didn't get very far. For me it's like a quick throb on my ankle, then my knee, then my other knee. It jumps around and occasionally my leg or foot will jump. Very weird. Movement helps a lot, so I plan to be up and around as much as possible. Wondering how long this will go on, from others it seems to last 2-3 days, hope I'm no different.

I remember it was your goal from the beginning. 10 miles would be awesome. LoJo- just a couple days from putting chemo behind you. What a relief it must be. Don't forget us here, we'd love to know what rads is like, plus how post chemo is going. Another part of this journey done. woot! Theantz- with 9 cycles done and only now feeling some neuropathy type symptoms I think your fortunate. Absolutely tell MO, send email if not seeing her/him before. There are the B vit and l glutamine. Let us know what your MO says. Proud-I had the initial energy boost from all the steroids with this first dose of Taxol. I thought maybe when it wears off I'll still be fairly motivated. Nope, frustratingly, I'm feeling more tired, and I also have to force myself to walk and do yoga. I sleep better when I do, so that at least motivates. Mimi- congrats on finishing rads. I'm glad your underarm is ok for the most part, however a crispy chicken thigh does give me pause. Is that how it feels? You mentioned no peeling or blistering, so I was a little confused. My weight has stayed stable. Up and then down, but always the same weigh in on infusion day. For those that feel cold, when I loose, I'm cold. I've always been that way. As soon as I stop loosing my temp returns to normal. My hubby is the same way. It's a coldness that is like bone deep. I can put on extra layers to no real affect. It's unpleasant really. Hoping for a good day for us all. Anxious to hear from leatherette, hugs and prayers Theresa Edit to add, Jen, yes, your days are non stop. Hopefully steroids will see you through today",

I had the same fatigue on 4 ad 5 on AC till I realized I needed to taper my steroids instead of just stopping them. I didn't figure this till the last infusion and no fatigue that time. I did the same with Taxol, I tapered it and no crash. So if you are taking steroids post infusion this may help, but like you said, we're all different. Overall DD taxol has been easier, the wild card is more the degree of aches and pains. Mine were very manageable this round. Take OTC meds with you (Aleve, Tylenol, Advil) and I was even given a script for Percocet that I didn't have to fill. However it was there if I needed it. If you had surgery and have a couple left take them with you in case sleeping through the pain becomes difficult. Good luck, to you and your son! Theresa",

I have one trip hanging out there for March, we'll see if it goes forward, depends on the timing of my hysterectomy after rads. But this ends soon and I know we'll be out there and this all behind. And yes it will be all the more sweet. This time next year let's post our goings on and I can't wait to hear about all the places we go. For me it's always about the beach or a cruise.

Jen, I remember you mentioning this trip and I'm so sorry it had to be cancelled, it sounded like a wonderful trip. Dodgersgirl, you definitely have had the most difficult imaginable time and you've handled it all with such grace. I can't wait to hear that you two are in your way to the ocean.

Paulette and leatherette, glad the air is improving, after watching the news I was really concerned for you California gals. Hoping you are far far away from this mess. In the east we contend with the occasional hurricane and I guess because we have such a lead time when they happen it doesn't seem as frightening as these fires. Good grief, what a nightmare. Praying for everyone out there. Travelhound, that's quite the mouth trick, it works fast, I'll keep it in mind and hope to never use it. My chemo nurses would probably have a cow, they didn't want me to even use a water pik. Haha, I think I'll tell them about it just to see their reaction. Sunnyjay, I finish in 8 days, I just have the initial RO, (really a second opinion, spoke to someone in May and have chosen a different facility that's closer) appointment. Will begin rads I would guess in mid Nov, be finished by the new year, as long as there are no delays. As far as who needs rads I think even the Drs don't have set guidelines. At first I was told a mastectomy equals lumpectomy plus rads. But, I see loads of mastectomies getting rads. Who knows, I sure don't. I also have great results with the really thick Eucerin cream in the jar. I massage it onto my feet 2-3 times a day. No peeling yet, we shall see. Proud, this is your good week, hope you fit in something enjoyable. Are you still bouncing back with the two on and one off? How's your hair, will it slowly recover and grow in? I have it starting on the sides and not on top yet. Not particularly happy with that. :-/ Sigh It's a rainy day so I'll be on the dreadmill again, the rest of the week looks lovely, though. A new bike/walking path opened up next to the river, I think it's time hubby and I check it out. Hugs and prayers, Theresa ",

What an awful week and I wish I had words to help, but I have nothing. I don't know how you feel either as I've lost loved ones to cancer but not while I'm in the the fight. Prayers said for your family. Paulette, I've had bloody nose if I blow it but not a nose bleed. I bet it has something to do with the awful air quality you're dealing with and the Taxol together. . I'm so sorry, I'm sure your sick of it. I find that when SE are manageable I'm so much better mood wise and when they get me down I then have my mood plummet. I'm sure we all feel that way, it annoys me that I can't get myself out of a funk quickly or sometimes at all. I have to wait for a good day to roll around. Sigh. I'm really counting on rads being easier for us all and better days. After all it will be the holidays and we deserve some fun with family and friends. Speaking of holidays, with Thanksgiving coming up anyone making plans? My sister will be coming up and bringing the dinner. I'm supplying the ham and turkey (my hubby deep fries it, turkey not ham ;-)) and she's doing the rest. I'm so grateful for her company and help. Proud, oh pooh, sounded like such a nice lunch, hope the tummy settles quickly. Hugs and prayers Theresa",

I knew a D flap would be more involved than the implants but wasn't aware of the time involved. However I agree with Paulette, go for it. I took a lot of Ativan during AC for nausea, no one told me it was addictive! Good grief. I only use it on my steroid nights now if I wake up and can't get back to sleep. I'll be careful, thanks. Paulette, well, since gas is such a problem and meds cause just as many problems maybe your diet can be tweaked a little. I think as you've written many times this chemo is doing a number on our bodies in so many ways, and what used to be no problem eating may be giving you some gas now. So think about what fresh produce your eating that may be reacting differently now and causing gas. I know proudtospin found that lobster bisque did a number on her this weekend and not before. Hope it's something simple like no more broccoli. Travel, actually I'm from the east, VA, but we do have a nice variety of birds and more so in the spring and fall during the migration. I love feeding them and watching what they're up to. But I love animals, so i end up feeding the squirrels, planting the right flowers and shrubs for butterflies and hummingbirds. I used to put out salt licks for the deer until they started treating my garden as their salad bowl. Had to draw the line. We live on the edge of a large wooded area and see all manner of critters. Hugs and prayers, Theresa",

She said I should shoot for three times a day for 60 min each session. Seems like a lot of sitting, I'll work it out somehow. Gorgeous outside today, sunny and upper 50's, Woot, I love fall. I'll walk this afternoon around the neighborhood and then I've taken steaks out to grill tonight. We try to use the grill as much as possible now because once it's cold we don't like to sit out there anymore. I'm definitely a fair weather griller. Jen, how are the ribs? Paulette, feeling any better today? sunnyjay, thanks for the article, I read a few things that I wasn't aware of. Good luck when you meet your RO. I'm hoping you won't need rads, but if you do, I feel it's well tolerated by almost everyone. It's just not without SE. Runnermum, glad you're doing well. You and your family remain in my thoughts and prayers. Travel, how is your hgb doing, do you still think you'll need transfusion? How many infusions do you have left? Purplestargazer, not sure if your still following, but congrats on finishing chemo!!!! Yay!!!! Leatherette, did you try the cognac? Just dying to know! Proud, hope you enjoying your off week, and I hope the air is good. We have so many California gals, hoping your all out of harms way and not choking on smoke. Prayers and hugs. Theresa",

I'll start the Monday after Thanksgiving, which works for me. 4 weeks after chemo would have been the week of Thanksgiving and I have company coming, so I was glad he suggested I enjoy Thanksgiving and then start.

Well I've been up since 5am enjoying all that steroids have to offer. Just a couple more sleepless nights. Funny how it didn't faze me in the least on AC, I slept like a baby on steroids. I've decided to get all my Christmas shopping done before rads start on 11/29. Would also like to get a bunch of dinners in the freezer for those nights during rads when I've run out of steam. My RO did say that the fatigue won't be as bad as I feel when I have my steroid crash. That's a relief. Well hubby got up earlier and I hear him banging around in the kitchen.

Up to anything fun or do you spend it catching up around the house? I think I read you've got some home improvement projects going on. I've decided to straighten a set of cabinets or drawers if not everyday than as often as possible. I did a bunch just before chemo so many are already done. I just need to feel productive. Travel-we had a guinea pig that we just loved to death, we took so long trying to come up with just the right name that he started to respond to being called \"pig\". So that ended up his name. We were so thrilled to see he answered to his name, I didn't know they were that smart. Such an adorable pet but they have such a short life span. :-/ LoJo-loved your update, you sound wonderful, your journey is almost over, can't believe it! It seems once we begin to feel better physically, that takes care of most of the mental issues. At least for me, I feel so much better in every way since I started Taxol and am looking forward to this next phase, especially when I read your posts!!! Runnermum- your Mom group sounds like the best, I'm sure last night was such fun and uplifting. I have a similar group, my Bible study ladies. We meet regularly for lunch and they've called, sent cards, visited. I love them to pieces. And yes I rang the sh++ out of that bell yesterday, it was cathartic for sure. Then I ran in circles with my fists in the air whooping it up. Yes I did! I think I shocked a few of them, but hey, who wants to see someone halfheartedly ring the chemo bell. Paulette-I said the clinical study was for locally advanced BC, but I was wrong, she had so much info in our visit yesterday I've gotten a few things turned around. The Ibrance study is for any early stage with a high recurrence rate. It's international, so a big study. I just hope I get the drug and not the placebo. I think this will be a real game changer if it works out to be beneficial in survival rates. Fingers crossed. Sunny- my RO went over the possibility of exacerbation of my lymphedema. I'll just be religious about the sleeve and gauntlet and pump 2-3 times a day and the exercises. That's all I can do, plus pray. Leatherette-I truly hope we all regroup and recharge btwn chemo and rads. Will you have rads? I'm loosing track of whose doing what? I hope your enjoying this week since you worked extra hard last week, will you still need to go in this week? When's the last infusion, very soon I think? Jen-I understand the push to start rads as soon as you can, I'm sure they'll accommodate you. My simulation is 11/3 I think, for some reason I didn't put it on my calendar, need to go check my notes. TheRO said he expects I'll have some blistering because I'm so pale (100% Irish, pale, freckled) and I'm going to be prepared. But, ignstead of freaking out I've decided blisters are nothing compared to 8 weeks of AC. I'll go braless, which means lopsided, but it is what it is. I need to get some loose blousy cotton shirts. What number is today's infusion? Has the fatigue been bad? Pingpong- how's it feel being 6 days PFC? I'm glad you have a nice break before surgery. Keep checking in and giving us updates on post chemo recovery, it gives us such a boost and something to look forward too. Well that's a ridiculous long post. So you can guess I also love long talks with my friends. My kids say I never have met a stranger because I can talk to anyone and in 15 min can have their life story. They used to hate that, but now I see it's rubbed off on them. Hehehe, that was my sneaky plan all along. Hugs and prayers Theresa  ",

Got my walk in then I've been working on making meatballs for the freezer to go with the marinara sauce. Doing it in stages, just chopped the onion and garlic. Proud, you are blessed with good friends, wishing you an uneventful infusion, this week is #12 and your doing so well with SE and of course it's working. No one knows what the future holds and seeing you do so well gives me such hope and comfort. I'm so glad you joined our group and decided to share with us. As far as your cleaning lady, good luck with that, I've had a few through the years and I've always ended up letting them go. I would do the dumbest stuff. Like I always straightened up before they'd come so they'd have less clutter and could do a better clean. (Yes, that's what I told myself) However I'd always go a little overboard and find I'm actually cleaning before they come to clean. Dumb! But I just didn't want anyone to see my house dirty. (I'm vain in that way, sigh) So I decided that was dumb dumb dumb and stopped it. Save the money and spend it on something fun. Now I've never actually confessed this to anyone besides my sister, she knows my OCDness and still loves me. My husband never knew, he thought I was just trying to be more frugal and I've let him believe that. Paulette, you too, tomorrow is #8, woo hoo, you're getting there. Next week you're 75% of the way through Taxol! Jen you're heading into the final few also, isn't this week 9? Runnermum, travelhound,and leatherette I think you're all finishing up this week, right? Pink, pingpong, sunny, LoJo, your updates are so appreciated, it's the part of BC.org that is the best and does me the most good. Thank you and please keep popping in Praying everyone's labs are good and neuropathy symptoms are few so that you can stay on track and finish up on time. Hoping you are all having a good day, you are always in my prayers. Theresa ",

The blankets you're making are so kind and will be so appreciated. I feel privileged that you shared your chemo journey with us, I know you were overwhelmed and dealing with such sorrow, thank you for coming back and posting here when it would have been so easy to let this slide. Your strength helpe us all. Paulette, you must be at your infusion and I know it's a long one. Wishing and praying for it to be uneventful and SE manageable.

Those of you working towards your last infusion, hang in, it's gonna be here soon. Travel I'm glad your neuropathy has leveled off and Jen, you had a dose reduction thank goodness. Proud, your regemine is working it's magic for you and your neuropathy is stable, that's amazing as the rest of us have had such a time with this drug, you're fairly tough I think. Pink, I walked a bit further today and am definitely noticing less SOB for the first time. It was so good to see a real difference finally. I'm so encouraged I plan to push to 2 miles tomorrow. Ping pong, how's the SOB going, any better? How about neuropathy now that you're what, 3 1/2 weeks PFC. Tpralph, how's PFC going? Are you doing rads?

I FEEL GREAT, I could almost cry at how grateful I am to not feel like I'm on the verge of loosing my stomach. Yesterday I was so productive and normal feeling. Today I'm going to clean the house, so happy to take some of the chores back from my poor hubby. Mari, so glad to hear from you. Is this round 2 then? I tried coconut water, so wanted it work, but it made my tummy unhappy. I'll try it again today now that it's settled down. Also the papaya, just double checking, do you think it works to make you \"go\" or make you not \"go\". I'm trying to not \"go\" at the moment. I kept walking on the dreadmill everyday since infusion even though I was having persistent nausea, I did it because it was supposed to help mitigate SE. I'm not sure it did but I kept at it anyway. Today I'm totally looking forward to it. Suunyjay - I brought a picnic lunch and we ate outside on the umbrella tables they had scattered around. Several patients were doing the same. In light of the bad experience I had post infusion I'm not sure I'll be able to get anything down this time. Ugh, just need an uneventful infusion so that I can get past this one and move forward. Have a decent day everyone. Each day we're closer to being done. I'll be moving on to rads, anyone else? Theresa",

I know you work and are a caretaker for your father, right? He sounds like a lovely man and a bright spot in your day. Please drop in occasionally, I keep you in my prayers but understands your constraints. Sunnyjay - you do have the right attitude. You are our \"Sunny\" one on here. Mari - I hope you had a better night. I was feeling so nauseous last week, actually since infusion. Loosing weight, just not thriving that the Dr okayed my taking the Ativan and it's worked beautifully. At .5mg I can function without any SEsuch as dizziness or grogginess. The nausea is gone, weight loss reversed and energy level is back. I only take 2 a day, only when I notice a funny tummy coming on. Plus I sleep like a baby. It's a game changer for me. I'm not concerned about addiction as it's such a low dose and only a couple time a day instead of the prescribed 4 times as needed. I think one at bedtime on the nights you need it is a good idea. Too many bad nights in a row has a terrible effect on health and recovery. Paulette- you sound like you had a great infusion day. Fantastic! Keep it up and keep posting! Lojo - hello, so glad you chimed in, another early starter already on infusion 2! Woot! What will you schedule be? Every three weeks for how many? Glad fatigue is your worst SE, however that's no small potatoes for sure. Not cold capping myself but so interested in the process. Did you bring the system with you or was your center one of the few with them available? Your hike sounded heavenly, you go girl and keep us up to date, I feel no shame in living vicariously through you ;) Jen- girl you're worrying me now, this mother hen needs to here from you, you to Enia. To all the infrequent posters just want you to know I pray and think about you, but I understand you may prefer to fly under the radar. That's ok we're all doing our thing and that's what counts. However I'll keep calling out to you because that's how I do my thing, just letting you know I'm always thinking about you all, and how you're doing on your journey. Never any pressure, just want you to know someone is interested in hearing about your day. Have to get my prechemo labs this morning. Then acupuncture this afternoon. Want to dust and vacuum the house and fix a nice dinner tonight, maybe make some kind of dessert, we'll see. Dunkirk was good, but not exactly what I expected. Tom Hardy had a great part, the hero and all. We enjoyed it. Haven't eaten popcorn at a theater in ages, but since I'm supposed to increase my salt intake and I'm still trying to keep my weight from falling, I imbibed on a small bag and it was delicious. Ahhh, the forbidden fruits!!! Have a nice day everyone with manageable SE and for those with first infusions on the horizon, have a good prep day. Hugs",

So far I'm pleased, my white counts have been off the charts and the cupping had to have played a role in my second infusion. It's actually called fire cupping. She takes these special glass jars, puts a long lit match in it, just in and out quickly and then places it on my back. She'd rubbed some kind of unscented oil on (my nose has become so sensitive to smells, I requested it). Then she moved it around all over my back, it had a little suction. After maybe 20 min she then lined up a bunch all along my spine for maybe 5-10min. Theresa",

I was crazy meticulous with mouth care while I had the sore. Every 3 hours I rinsed with either salt or baking soda rinses. Then I used my water pick to clean between my teeth then the magic mouthwash. I felt like I spent my whole day doing mouth care. But within 4 days it was healed. It was on my tongue and it was big.

I unfortunately lost over 3 units of blood and that caused a few problems not the least of which was a Hgb before surgery of nearly 13 and after surgery 9.2. I truly felt awful, the worst on this whole journey. Finally this week I feel like I'm bouncing back, or my body is finally adjusting to such a low hgb. However the good news is pathology was all good, so now I'm done with this mess! Hooray!!! Runnermum how are you doing, you sounded down? What surgery in June, reconstructive? Sunnyjay, thanks for asking about my surgery, sorry to hear about your Aunt. However your Jazzersize sounds so fun, yay! Jen, had my port removed with my surgery, a real pleasure to have it gone, I hated the thing. Ovary removal was done laparoscopically as I'm sure yours will, no issues, easy recovery from that. Good luck and check back in to give us an update. My daughter graduates May 5, so looking forward to it, will be gong down a few days early to see family, then later in the month we're spending a week in the Shenandoah. Prayers and hugs ",

My brother has a beach house and it was available. Rough seas today means good shelling tomorrow. I'll be out there first light. No drying of my fingertips, just dark spots near the nail beds on three fingers. MO said it's a normal SE and not a sign of anything bad like loosing fingernails. I continue to use nail envy and a OPI cuticle oil daily. However I use eucerin body cream on my feet daily, have for years and they always stayed soft. Now a little dry.

Sorry you're on this journey. Proud, I have the slightest tingling in my fingertips of my left hand. I feel like it's a race to finish before it turns into more. Can't wait to ring that bell. Paulette, prayers said for a normal US, glad your steroid high has subsided. Leatherette, I love the idea of tea in her memory, she's smiling because you knew her so well. Jen you go girl, walking 5 miles a day, good grief, I have to up my game! Proud, so glad you have the two week break that allows you to feel good. How long are the suggesting this regimen? Dmjmom, aren't you having your last chemo this week. Ring that bell with gusto. Runnermom how's DD Taxol going? Sunny, working during trearment is exhausting I'm sure. I would probably come home and collapse before dinner. All you ladies working during this are truly amazing. Hugs and prayers for us all, have a god day Theresa",

I have DD #3 on Monday, and for the first time am anxious to get there and get going. 17 days till I ring the bell, and youll be a few days behind that, Woot!!!! Paulette, sunny, I would imagine these BP issues will resolve once infusions are complete. Does your MO feel this is something more than that, I just assumed these things would resolve. However I know that white coat syndrome is a real thing, my hubby has it and his Dr treats his BP based on readings he takes regularly at home. In the office they can get ridiculously high. Paulette, I felt so bad to hear of your cancelled trip to Japan. Please reschedule and then come back and give us a complete report. Once we're back at it, it would be so uplifting to hear about everyone's trips, kids achievements, careers advancements, promise me guys that you'll pop back in. We keep each other going now and I want to be able to cheer us on in the good times that are coming. Leatherette, it's hard not to get down on the low energy days, it's frustrating and I wonder how I'll possibly finish. I felt that way on Mon and Tues this week. Then Wednesday and Thursday were better. Today I have a very busy day, hoping to have the energy to get through. I think I remember you have just one month till you're done. You've got this! Sunny, your SE may be ahead, but it's got to be easier just knowing that it the last of them. At least that's what I'm counting on. Prayer said for an easy time for you. I don't know for sure about the timing between chemo and rads, and my RO appt isn't till 10/19, but I was under the impression we'd get around a month break. My daughter is coming home for a long weekend, looking so forward to some fun girl time. We both love British films and we'll be going to see \"Victoria and Abdul\" movie for sure. Hoping for a good SE day so spirits are lifted, and let the planning for our future trip, or at least some daydreaming begin. Hugs and prayers, Theresa     ",

I've read people in the previous chemo threads post they finally have the chemo SE all figured out by the last one. The first one is a mystery, the second you make a few adjustments with meds based on how the first dose went. Infusion 3 comes along and the constipation in the first two is diarrhea this time.

During the whole thing the hospital I used was the one here at home, so my MO, who is out of town wasn't involved. I feel 100% better now that I'm home. I'm also not taking Claritin and have had no pain, my white count was checked today and it was 28K. So the neulasta worked. I was very nauseous and on IV Ativan from Tuesday in the wee hours till Thursday am. Slept through it all for the most part. Aparently low sodiums make you sick as a dog. I was. Now all is well, haven't had anything for nausea since 11:30 am today, hoping it's done for the most part. Dry mouth sucks, think I feel a few little irritations around my lips. I didn't start rinsing with salt and baking soda till yesterday as I was zonked out. Also didn't eat a thing all day Tues or Weds. So started real slow with clear liquids then soft solids. Finally had a few bits of food late last night. Just eating very small amounts frequently. Is that what you guys are doing? Just can't get very much down at once.

Ate a couple pieces of toast this morning with Gatorade as I'm not to have too much water. That's not a problem as I've gone off the taste of it now. My hubby loves all the news channels and I used to too. It's a circus for sure! I'm glad your meds are good for you. The neulasta shot sounds interesting, adds a little excitement to your day. Haha, I'm sorry, don't take offense I have a dark sense of humor at times. I get what you meant about the hair coming out and your relief. I had been totally ready for the neulasta pain and when it didn't happen at all, I thought it didn't work, what gives. So I had them draw a blood count just to see when they did my last labs and it was a relief to see that it did. I'm real curious to see what my MO thinks of it. I'm wondering if I need it. Jen - so glad you had a good night, I know you'll have a better day. KimE, purplestargazer, she, janeway, Mari, Matryoska, BUZZBEE, Pingpong, and hope for the future, thank you posting and if you haven't lately we miss you and want to hear how you are doing so far. Sunnyjay, leatherette, dmjmom, theantz, - same, your infusions are coming up, how's the prep going? Going to go try the dreadmill downstairs, ugh, I used to love that thing.",

My port has only just recently stopped feeling creepy, it is a weird thing to have implanted. The nurse in recovery after it was implanted said \"now that you have it, keep it for as long as you can. You can keep it for years\". I looked at her and thought there is no way on This good earth I would keep this one second longer than I need to. I have never been a comfort eater, wish I was now though. I'm having trouble eating just because I'm unhappy, let alone feeling crummy. So I understand your weight loss, and it would be good for you if you can try to find some nutritious things that appeal to you. My Ativan is 5mg and it helps the nausea better than zophran, which gives me a headache to boot. Don't worry about your doctor thinking your trying for more or stronger drugs. They've dealt with ladies in the same situation as you and know what you need. They're not here to judge you, no one will. You have to be upfront with what's going on so you get the care you need. Hugs Jen - Punta Cana sounds heavenly. Keep on working on those vacation planst",

That's hard for me as I'm a big water drinker, but ya do what ya gotta do. I've learned to like coconut water, and it's better for you than Gatorade. My scalp is irritable today, wonder if it's heralding the hair loss. I'm thinking maybe so. Very curious what my post infusion week will be like. I spent day 2 and 3 completely zonked on IV nausea meds last time. Really hoping all that nausea was due to electrolyte imbalance. Either way I'll be asking for different meds for the immediate post infusion nausea. Spending the day with my daughter, lunch and a movie. Then to bed early and hoping for a better day tomorrow. Wish me luck, or if inclined say a prayer as I won't lie, I'm a bit worried. Hugs Theresa",

The steroid is probably helping with nausea, but \"0\" energy boost,however not complaining as I slept well last night. I had originally sent out notes to everyone, now I'm abbreviating it in the interest of not finding an excuse to avoid the dreadmill that's waiting for me downstairs. Runnermum, leatherette and dmjmom, your so ready to get this show on the road, and its feels like such an accomplishment to get one under your belt. Post in with any SE questions, we're all new at this too, but between us all we've probably read thousands of pages of info. Plus sweet ladies like Dodgersgirl and others pop in here frequently. Sunnyjay and Paulette- your going to be rounding the ben on the worst SE real soon. So glad your keeping us informed and letting us know what works and what not. Matryoshka- the hair loss, yup it's been one of the hardest things for me. I love my thick wavy hair that has the exact right cut so I can do it up in 10 min and it always looks great. MY ONLY shining feature. Ugh. But I'm very interested in the new hair in about 6/7 months. We shall see. I hate myself in hats and scarves, I just don't have the face shape for them. Sigh. We will persevere. Janeway- I want to attend your class, I'm a sci fi nut. Particularly Star Trek, my kids, grown now, would have fought to get in your classes. Theantz - glad your SE seem manageable, yay! LoJo - keep posting your walking routine, it helps me get motivated. Thank you for all the hugs, wishes and prayers, it brought tears to my eyes each one. I'm so sentimental,my poor husband kept wondering why I kept tearing up every time I looked at my phone, between family, church friends, and you guys I was a fawcet. I was so scared at the time and didn't really calm down till about bedtime as it was obvious then that things were fine. Love you all, your ever in my prayers, Mother hen  ",

Paulette- sending prayers for easy uneventful infusion, manageable SE. Hugs! You will find it's an easier week just because the first one is the BIG unknown. My sister arrives for the weekend and excited for that. We plan on going to Spider-Man tomorrow, I always liked him. Then a cookout and time spent together. Got the house in order again, my daughter is such a help. Then next week post infusion it can slide by with just straightening that my hubby and daughter keep up. We'll keep this routine till my daughter returns to school, then we'll have a cleaning service come in I think. I figure four cleanings over the 8 weeks of Taxol won't completely break the bank. My plan had been to take a bible study class this summer that my church is offering both in the church and online. So far I've let that slide, so my goal this week is to get in the routine to spend time on it everyday. Post infusion week I usually have little energy but I should be able to sit and do that. Also my gardens are getting quite shabby without anyone keeping at them. So I started today just puttering around in the cool morning air and it's so nice to be out there. My hubby takes care of feeding the birds and I filled the bird baths. So trying this week to get into life again. I honestly think I've been in shock since my first infusion and the admission then the fear leading up to the second infusion about it all happening again. Then waiting to see how the week after infusion would go, as the first time I was in the hospital and nothing went well. So this week I see that life can be normal and I'm getting back to it. What a strange journey this has been. Have a Good Friday, especially to you Paulette. Keep us up to date everyone. Theresa ",

Leatherette and Paulette - thanks on tree oil advice. My sense of smell is so sensitive and my tummy so sick of smells that I haven't even removed the top to just see what it's like. I sure hope Taxol lets my sense of smell calm down. My poor hubby has to take a gasex before bed each night because I just couldn't stand it.

I'ddefinitely follow up with your PC and get to the bottom of this so it never comes back. Yay!! A position SE for once. Hope you had a good night last night. Dodgersgirl- yes, your righty surgery was easier than chemo by far, even with an AND. My BS injected my entire area with some kind of long acting numbing agent and I had practically no pain for 5 days. I was able to use Tylenol only those days.

Between the worry of an infection and the frustration of putting chemo back, I feel for you both. Since I started this, my driving goal has been to get through all treatments on time at full strength, as I'm sure you feel the same. Well second goal is to come through healthy and I guess that's will mean delays at times. Prayers and hugs. AC #4 yesterday, and I feel really wrong today, it's taking a lot of effort to type this out as the typos are unbelievable. I real like my head weighs a ton and so drowsy. No change in any meds I'm taking or Pre meds. If this is chemo brain then I'm going to have a fit, I feel like a dullard. Plus I knocked my neulasta half off last night so I get to enjoy the 4 hour round trip for that. I could just kick myself over that fiasco. Ugh! On the bright side AC is done and MO feels Taxol is easier for most, but some have debilitating pain. So an either or thing with one being the pits. Last gripe, ( I know, yet another) lymphedema has set into my right arm. Oh joy! Hope to get in for an evaluation this week. Wishing everyone a good day, SE free or manageable. Healing for all us us dealing with those issues, keep posting good or bad. If you post a SE that's not really heard off that often, then it helps the next one of us who may have it pop up to not get too excited over it. Hugs, theresa",

So I pushed the nurse call button. Within 10 seconds my nurse and 5 others are in the room doing their thing. One dose of steroid and everything calmed down and we started everything back after about 20 min. No more problems and uneventful from there. Benedryl knocked me out and I slept about an hour, which was nice because Taxol was a three hour infusion. So now I wait to see what kind of muscle and joint pain I may have. Does anyone know when this usually starts? Leatherette- did you contact your doctor? I have read of someone who experienced all you mentioned except for the bile colored urine. She did what you did, rested for a bit then went off to work without any other symptoms. Hope your feeling well today. Purple - thanks for the info your Taxol infusion particularly on nausea meds. My MO continued the Zophran IV premed but not the Emend. I took a Zophran at bedtime but didn't set my alarm, just took another when I woke up this morning. She feels I may need a little help the first few days because of my reaction to AC. Plus the steroid helps. So far I feel a 100 percent better than day 2 on AC. Yay! Mari - I'm sorry about the cold. Hopefully you'll shake it soon since no longer dealing with chemo. I wonder how long after we finish before our immune systems are back to normal? Paulette - I know what you mean, we spent a lot of meals eating what appealed to me at the time. My husband would run any errand at dinner time so he could bring whatever appealed to me that evening. Now I'm so looking forward to eating meals prepared at home, especially all the things I put in the freezer. Plus it worried me a tad to eat food prepared by people with the sniffles or worse. Proudtospin-storming heaven. Dmjmom - I've decided to start soaking in an epsom bath each day on the off chance it may help neuropathy and my nails from lifting. We'll see, can't hurt and I've read lots of ladies swear by it. Happy to hear the pains are less and only one more to go! Woot, can't believe the end is in sight, seems like yesterday we were stressing over how the first one would go! Runnermum- you're sounding great and are coming out of this strong, you continue to inspire me,thanks. Please keep posting to motivate me. I bought a yoga for cancer book and DVD and plan to start today. Felt so bad on AC I felt it was an accomplishment to walk each day. But feel I can handle adding this to Taxol. Plus there is a yoga group for cancer patients on Fridays I'll start this week. Jen - Good luck today, woot, Taxol # 1. I was so worried about the reaction too, just have faith in your team, the nurses know what their doing. I told them how worried I was and they said that it happens enough that they are very at ease in dealing with it, they've always had it react to their measures. After that I did relax. In fact I was playing word with friends and had decided I was going to be one of the lucky ones that don't react and then a couple minutes later it hit. They rushed in gave me the steroid and because it's IV it was instantly working and resolved. Now that I see how it works,future infusions won't worry me. Although I've read that this is usually limited to the first two infusions. Post back and give us an update. Theantz- how are you, has the infection in your port cleared and are your infusions continuing?m Sunnyjay - did the redness clear and were you able to continue your infusions? She1212. -I think you may have moved on to Taxol. How are you doing with it? Hav a great day all, now that we're near the end or halfway point it's so much easier. Hooray for us!

My MO gave me the option of an extra week off before Taxol and at first I said no, but then there was a scheduling conflict and I had no choice. It was the best thing I've done. That extra week gave me so much energy, all GI issues resolved, both upper and lower. Gained energy. I felt nearly like the day I started AC. So I feel ready to finish this. I wish everyone took a three week break after AC before Taxol, I recommend it. Keep persevering, it's hard and we feel so crummy, but push when you can and go easy on yourself, forgiving when you can't. Hugs and prayers said for an easier time with Taxol. Theresa",

It's a subtler flavor then banana bread, he uses whole wheat and oats, no oil because of the banana. So I feel so very healthy eating it. Paulette, PT helps a lot. Once I started I regained full range of motion within a week. I was totally blown away, as before PT I had begun to develope the beginning of a frozen shoulder. I started a yoga DVD for people undergoing chemo and then it has more active moves for recovery. I had planned to start it with AC, but I couldn't manage anything more than a 30 min walk each day. So now I'm pleased that I've added that in. Keep up the exercises every day and you'll move right along. Proudtospin, thank goodness for takeout else I'm not sure what I'd have done through AC.

Paulette-I have no advice, I had a small amount of swelling on my lower right arm and wear a sleeve for a good part of the day and it keeps it away. If I do this and manual lymphatic drainage then the chance of it being a real issue are nil. The sleeve is very tolerable to me. So today I made my RO consult appointment for 10/12 and I'm going to squeeze in a colonoscopy before rads start. I'm also due for a bone density test so I'll get on that tomorrow. Will these appointments ever end? Day # 3 DD Taxol, just now noticing the weird pains starting. They are the oddest thing, they are pulses of pain that jump from one joint to the next, is it like that for you guys too? It's only really annoying when trying to get to sleep. Took Aleve at bedtime last time, but with elevated liver enzymes I'm going to see if I can tough it out. We'll see. Hugs and prayers, Theresa  ",

I'm thinking that plays a part in how irritated your nasal passages were yesterday. I'm running errands today with DH, it gets me moving and I walk extra aisles in the stores to up my step count, more interesting than the dreadmill. Plus we'll stop for lunch and I might need to drop by Yankee Candle to see what's new. Yup, I think I may need a little autumn candle plate and shade duo, then a stop by the wild bird store. I'm a backyard birder. Will be starting the Project Feeder Watch Nov 11th. Have done it for a few years and I'm thinking I'll have a little more time to devote to it this year.

Jen, the 2 weeks after last chemo are psychologically weird to be sure. They were my worst two weeks on Taxol so I felt ba. Very hard to be \"up\" when feeling bad. My husband was so elated it was over, he kept commenting how I must be so relieved, I didn't have the heart to tell him how I really felt, a little let down. Once I passed the two week point things got better quickly. I've had a real surge in energy this past week, walking the same route I did before all this began is the big one. Been working up to that for it seems forever. Fixing dinner each night, I never had the energy even on the best day, so that's a nice change. Dropped 8lbs which always feels good. I'm sure I have crummy days ahead as my skin worsens, but I'm enjoying today. Today will be 5/30 at rads, hope the week flies by like last week. LoJo, life has changed for us all, but I absolutely love everything from my old life that I've gotten back. I echo what you all have said about changes we've made for the better. I've changed my priorities and have learned to let things that aren't important go. I'm not an uptight person but I had what I called \"standards\" that I have just dropped. I'm happier without them, and so is everyone around me. Well I gotta get going. Have a good day, hugs and prayers.",

No sooner was I for the most part back to normal and he went down for the count. Many of you are getting those first mammos or scans of some sort. Had mine 2/14 which seems like a crummy way to spend Valentine's, but the radiologist where I go reads all survivors immediately and comes out with the results, so I left there happy and relieved. Also had a pelvic US to check the ovaries. They'll be coming out 3/13 along with my L breast. Have a family history and I'm more comfortable getting it over instead of worrying. Then this journey is over, hooray. Most of you will be in the final stages of reconstruction, it's fascinating to hear all the steps. So happy to see all this wrap up in time for summer. Clynne,welcome to the group, never too late. What GI issues are you dealing with? Edit to add, I started my AI a couple weeks ago too. Going well. I sat there the first night and struggled with the first dose. Like everything so far staring something new was scary. Of course it was the least on a long line of things we\u2019ve dealt with.",

Runnermum, I had the ovaries and tubes out as there\u2019s a family history of ovarian cancer, but it\u2019s occurred to ladies in their late 70-80\u2019s. Before my Dr felt it was just related to older age and things go wrong. Now with my diagnosis and my sisters they suggest to just get them out and be done. Also I had a hysterectomy a decade ago for fibroids. However I\u2019d have had that done too if they ( cervix and uterus) weren\u2019t already gone. Back when I had the hysterectomy my GYN urged me to have the whole thing done, but no I choose not to. Ugh, however it\u2019s done now. Feeling stronger everyday, however nowhere as good as Pre surgery, eating healthy and using my dreadmill everyday. So doing what I can, guess I just have to wait for my bone marrow to kick out those rbc\u2019s. Have a good one.",

Purple - i can understand completely, we do whatever gets us through. I joined a couple FB breast cancer groups, but realized instantly that it was causing me real dread and fear when I read their posts. I had to leave the groups for my self preservation. If you feel comfortable here, or it turns out to be too much, either way I'm thinking and praying for you. Lightseeker - I read on here about another gal who had the racing heart, just the one time, they also gave here Ativan and it was relieved. She said it never happened again. Regarding the hair. Just after my second infusion I too was washing my hair and my scalp felt sore in a couple areas. A few days later it started to drop. A few days after that it came out in huge clumps in the shower. And so it goes. Runnermum- I've been doing acupuncture since mid June to gear up for this. After my first infusion and the problems I had with nausea, my acupuncturist then switched to cupping. I go on the Saturday before my Monday infusions. She felt this would work really well to counteract it. I can honestly say that this infusion has been much better, nausea way better. Plus since its cupping and no needles, no worries on the neutropenia front. I found it quite relaxing. I walked into that appointment with very mild nausea, walked out and it was gone and didn't return till day 4&5, but more manageable. So that's an option to discuss with your therapists. I hope it works as well for you. I do keep crackers at my bedside, I wake in the night with an empty tummy and a couple do the trick. Same first thing in the morning. Have a good day ladies. Be active as you can, I do envy those who are working. I can say though that my head is in a better place this infusion (#2) than the first. I'm thinking I was really worried and each day was wait and see what happens. So far this infusion has been a copy of the first with less nausea. I'm ready to move on to #3. Let's get this done and over. It's going to be such good days when people start chiming in that they've completed all their infusions. It's going to get here before we know it. Hugs Theresa ",

However I'm happy to see her go and get back to a world that's not revolved around someone working through chemo SE. Since I started chemo I've made my bedroom off limits to my two kitties. They both insist on sleeping on my pillow. One all day long and the other wraps his head around my head most nights. I figured with a low white count at times I should cut that out. So in the mornings when I'm laying here in bed they sit outside trying desperately to get in. Poor babies just a few more weeks. Monday is AC #4 and although I'm thrilled to get that behind me and move to taxol I'm also afraid of this new drug too. I'll have a 3 week instead of two week break between AC and Taxol because of a scheduling conflict, so we decided to spend it on the Outer Banks at my brothers beach house. It will be so nice to go away and hopefully feel almost normal. I'm hoping that extra week will feel SE free. Dodgersgirl- how is your husband? I read where he had open heart surgery. You've both been in my prayers. Also I believe your at or near Taxol# 12. I've been following the weekly Taxol thread, congrats. Sunny - after AC #2 I was dismayed to find 3 nails had darkened areas. I've been using nail envy since before I started treatment. So I've continued and MO said that tee tree oil is something to try if nail beds begin to lift. I'm going to find some today and start now. However she did warn it smelled awful. Ick, I wonder what it smells like. I'll let you know. Dmjmom, leatherette and Paulette- looks like you have infusions this week, sending prayers and hugs. Purple - your ponytail halo sounds adorable. I haven't had hair long enough for a ponytail in years, but I love the idea. I'm sorry cold capping didn't work but glad to see you're ok with it. I would have loved to have tried but just never got around to it. So I just let it go. Now I'm glad not to have added it on. Emily - your right on the dairy, the first two rounds I had more of an issue trying to keep diarrhea at bay, the dietician told me to cut out the dairy and it helped a lot. Babasmom - I'm so sorry for your awful first infusion and I'm so glad you are following and have decided to post. Hopefully the Lomotil has done the trick for your diarrhea. I can tell you that each infusion is different, some worse and some better, hopefully the migraines either subside or your MO can help you deal with it. Please keep us updated. Prayers and hugs your way. LoJo - your upbeat post about your decision on the hair and cold capping was such good news. Not that you gave it up, I'm sorry it didn't work, but that your decision took so much stress off of you. When is your next infusion and what will it be and how often. I'm not nosey at all, LOl. Rebamacfan - love the picture and so encouraging to see hair coming in. I hope I'm as lucky, that would put me at getting some fuzz first of January! Woot!! She- I'm so glad your feeling great, and I'm relieved to say no problems with the verbal filter. That's a struggle I don't need, good luck with that though. Living with my poor hubby who's trying so hard to do everything he can to alleviate stress around here I'd hate to fly off at him. Paulette- I use the same wash and lotion I use on my face on my scalp. So far so good. I'll be switching to something heavier like a night cream once I start taxol since it's so drying. Have a great day ladies, you are always in my prayers for manageable SE and good days. Theres",

Honestly it's more annoying than anything. It hasn't slowed me down yet. For me, the worst part of Taxol was the fear of an anaphylactic reaction during the infusion. No lie, I was quite worried about that. Once I had the little episode and everything calmed down I was so relieved. Dodgersgirl, I can handle a couple days, thanks for the response. How has post chemo recovery gone. Extremely interested in any hair regrowth, energy levels, lingering SE. Thanks. Theresa",

For me it's been so so much easier than AC. Purple, yes on AC my appetite and what appealed to me was all over the place, particularly the first 7-8 days. Unfortunately I ate things I would never ever have eaten before chemo. Burgers just appealed to me something awful. The remaining days of that infusion I ate healthy as I could. Taxol is so much easier, I've eaten very healthy from day one and no more junk snacks. Each infusion is different so I hope this holds up. My energy level also is normal, it feels so wonderful to feel good, I find myself thanking the Lord continually for this change and asking for it to continue. However I know fatigue is a thing and will most likely catch up with me. LoJo, I started nail envy with AC and have continued. I agree that stuff is amazing. My nails are growing like crazy. Love the stuff. I can't get over how high maintenance I've become, between nails, mouth rinses, slathering on lotion, skin checks, gloves on to wash dishes or anything at all with household cleansers let alone pulling a weed from the garden. I think twice about whether to eat out because someone in the back touching the food has a stomach ache or a cold. I'm counting the days to being my old self. Sigh. Jen, last night my aches started easing off, today I haven't bothered to take anything as it's not too noticeable. How are you doing? Proudtospin- praying hard for good scan results today, hugs",

Dodgersgirl, in doing a review of women who've taken Adrymycin they found those on Lipitor had significantly less incidence of heart damage. So a small study was done with the same results. Now they're doing a large nationwide study and I'm in that one. I had to do labs and a heart MRI to qualify. Then when accepted I did more labs and a cognitive test. I'm either taking a placebo or 40mg of Lipitor for the next two years and every 6 months labs, physical, heart MRI and cognitive test. All of this is being monitored by the top cardiac oncologists in the country so at least if AC did any damage that could be detected early then it'll be seen quickly. Linda, definitely take a break. I sure do. I should be gearing up on everything related to rads, I read a little and some of it sounds overwhelming so I take a break. Protect your mental health, it's very hard to pull out of a funk and it will impact you more than aches and pains ever will. Some thrive on knowing every scrap of info and others want only what the Dr tells them. Whatever works for you to keep you sane then do it. No one judges. Paulette, when do you hear about your thyroid US? Prayers for normal results. Sunny, are the hives and swelling subsiding? I sure hope so. The hot weather has to be the worst. Ugh! Praying for relief LoJo, all the misery you went through with the hives and delays are now giving others info and hope in dealing with the same. You're a blessing! Regarding frost bitten toes numbing and tingles. I read through a ton of Taxol threads and came up with all this. Unfortunately none of it is backed by research it's anecdotal, but some of it is pushed by doctors. Icing has a bit more going for it in research but just barely. It's great for standard Taxol but a little harder with the 3 hour DD infusion. B6 and B12 supplements L glutamine Massaging feet with Underly smooth foot cream. (Due to this containing parabens and my tumor strongly estrogen pos I'm using Eucerin cream) I massage 2-3 times a day. Epsom salts baths, soaks, scrubs. I use the bath daily if for nothing than to help my nails and toenail to stay healthy as I don't want them lifting off. Please add anything your doing to this list so we can do all we can to ward off neuropathy. She1212, I believe you must be on Taxol now too. How are you doing? Theantz, how are the toes doing, has the tingling subsided? I believe chemo is done, what's next? Today is a good day, because I didn't have a reaction yesterday during Taxol I didn't get the extra dose of steroid and was able to sleep fairly well with the help of an Ativan. Have a decent amount of energy today yay! One last thing. My daughter is being treated for the flu and is away at University. The school clinic was slammed so she went to the urgent care, they were packed too. She has classmates with it too. Mentioned to my infusion nurse and they have two nurses out who just tested positive this week. BE CAREFUL, get all your family members their shots now. My MO says I can't but hubby is getting his today. Looks like it's arrived early on the Midatlantic area. Ugh! ",

Travelhound - this stuff is mostly anecdotal and complied from others who've related what they're MO or neurologists have told them. Some neurologist's suggest Epsom salts for neuropathy, and many MO's suggest it when nails begin to lift to keep them clean and ward off infections. I'm proactive in that it might help neuropathy and it could help the nails. Plus I just put it in a bath and soak about 15 min, very relaxing, I also add a couple drops of lavender oil, my favorite. No, I've never taken Lipitor before and my lipids have always been textbook normal. Unfortunately many times the cardiac effects from Adrimycin don't show up till later. However since they became aware they have lowered the dose allowed and the incidence has dropped to less than 1%, plus there are lifetime limits and we will never have that drug again. Jen - you're so right, we can't afford to get overwhelmed with the \"why\" it's a dark place that we can't get pulled into.

I see that some old threads have lasted years and I thought how wonderful to have that connection last. Leatherette wishing you a uneventful 4th infusion today, woot, only 2 more. Paulette, how is your arm today? I think when you get a sleeve you'll be much happier, they're not bulky like those dressings I've seen, I can't blame you for removing it. Sunnyjay, I don't think you did anything to cause the swelling, I think for the most part there's no rhyme or reason. From what I've read exercise isn't supposed to cause it, they seem to know little about why or how it starts for most of us. Some people do overdue or traumatize the arm, but mostly my PT says it just happens. The important thing is to not let it go and get it treated so it doesn't progress beyond stage 1. Praying for a resolution to your hives, now that we're near the end no one wants anything to hold us up from completing all the doses. I'm trying to eat cleanly to lower my liver enzymes. It's always something. LoJo, you seem to be moving at light speed now, good grief it seemed like yesterday you were the one stalled and now here you are getting your tats! I'm jealous 😂. Had to get up at 0 dark 30 for an early echocardiogram, now I'm whipped. I have to go pack up a care package for my daughter, she had the flu this week at school so she needs some cheering up. Thankfully the Dr there gave her Tamiflu and she's almost over it. Have a great day ladies, Theresa",

You're going to finish up soon and then once you're up to it you'll be right back to work. Just don't jump the gun, it's easier to take the extra days then to start and stop again.

I had started back to church after a break this fall. Once you started hearing coughing everywhere we decided to take a break until chemo was over. Now I've decided to take another break till rads are over as flu is becoming widespread in our state. Ugh! Don't need a long break in the middle of rads due to flu. I'm sure you're all as sick of worrying about this stuff as I am. My rash has now completely healed and not even pink. So this couldn't be rads related, a mystery. Tomorrow is 10/30 so a third of the way done. So incredibly easier than chemo. With it being nearly Christmas I always have an errand, then home and a walk and a few things to do around the house and the day is done. Going very quickly, thank the Lord.

I've only had the flu twice and each time it took me weeks to recover. Sunny, when is your last rad? So glad your skin is doing so well. Well, right now my hair color if it doesn't darken is heading in the direction of Susan Powter's and the length will be there in a couple of months, however the rest of me is sadly not going to look like her, sigh. Today I'm running to world market after rads to get some fun candy for stockings, then I need to pick up the basement and wrap all my daughter's gifts. Lately I've been dropping to sleep the minute my head hits the pillow. That might be my favorite thing PFC, getting enough activity to bable to sleep well at night. Hugs and prayers.",

It's freezing cold out and I'm happy to stay warm and cozy insidewith my DH. Christmas Eve I was putting a blackberry cobbler in the oven and forgot I had my wig on. It's synthetic. At dinner my daughter asked what I was doing to my wig to curl up the ends so. Took a look in the mirror and it had all shrunk and melted/frizzed. Ugh! We were sitting in a restaurant, there was nothing I could do but chalk it up. So now I'm waiting for the replacement. Hair is still coming in at a glacial pace, but at least it's growing. Enjoy the weekend, take care and hope all your Christmas's were peaceful and blessed",

Sunny, I love the mascara on the sideburns, made me smile at how creative we have to be. My areas not getting the boost didn't worsen but actually healed well this week while the axilla and scar line got the boosts. The axilla worsened since yesterday but the scar line looks the same. If the axilla continues to worsen at least it's only a small area. We shall see. I've been wearing a mans white cotton undershirt since I started using Aquaphor. Coupled with a pair of jeans, I feel like a bum. Also since my left foot has some residual neuropathy and I read somewhere to keep your feet protected and in padded roomy shoes I've been wearing these large Reeboks with heavy cotton socks. I thought I'd put up with this uniform till I no longer need the greasy Aquaphor, at that point I feel I've babied my feet enough. I can't wait to get into stylish outfits again. Be careful and don't let your guard down yet, the flu seems to be awful! Prayers and hugs",

So this Thursday I see a GYN at the center where my BS will do my prophylactic mastectomy so I can have my ovaries removed at the same time. I'm getting this done in March after I return from Hilton Head. Surgery back in May was the easiest part of this journey and I expect this to be easy too. Then I can say it's finally over. I see my MO a week from Monday and will be starting my AI and a new clinical trial. Hopefully I'll be randomized into the trial drug group and not the placebo. Have a great weekend.

My chemo nurse did tell me something I had not read online. Load up on water the first 3 nights as the cytoxan causes bladder problems when you let it sit for hours in there. Irritation that can cause it to bleed. They said they want you to pee several times a night. Jen- I had chemo class a couple weeks ago, it was informative for logistics, and the one hint about cytoxan. I was glad I went.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon as I love movies. Got my walk in only 30 min as I didn't leave enough time before my wig appointment. Going to get some cycling in after I clean the bathroom. If only all the sessions would have this period of normalcy at the end. But I know the effects are cumulative. Janeway - no issues personally, but I've read it happens and it seems it's usually a matter of finding the direction it's facing and then using it. Haven't heard of one flipping over, keep us informed though and sending prayers it's just a simple fix. Dmjmom - you are ready, and yes keep up the treadmill as much as possible. On my worst day a lumbered along for 2 -15 min walks, that was a really crummy day (dreadmill day) A few days were hard but doable, now I'm back to normal. So glad your healing right up. My doctor was concerned about my healing and only did what was needed, I still have to go back for a right mastectomy. At the time she said she didn't want there to be any delays due to healing. I thought, why would there be delays? But since that time I've read about all kinds of wound issues. You never know who's going to get it or why it seems.

My MO called and wants a bone scan as an enzyme, alkaline phosphotase went up right after surgery and then has just fluctuated up ands down but never back to normal. Ugh. So it's tomorrow morning. Keep me in your prayers. All is well, on day 3, slightly funny tummy at times but still taking nausea meds on the scheduled time as my last infusion it was bad till day 4. Then I'll see how tomorrow goes. When did you gals start to taper off zophran etc. No BM problems, appetite good, I didn't have bone pain last time hoping for the same. I've found this time that when I set my alarm for meds I also eat a few crackers, drink 8oz of water with a Nuun tablet dissolved in it (very nice suggestion, was that runnermom or Mari?) rinse my mouth and use biotene then fall back to sleep. Usually twice a night. I do this because I was cautioned not to load up on fluids but worried about the hemorrhagic bladder so I want to get up at least twice to void so I work it around meds. Nothing planned for today, I think I'll straighten up my hobby room and organize it for scrap booking. It's a smallish room, but it has a nice size table and shelving. I just rearrange it to suit what I'm working on so the items are accessible. I would like to make the work space convenient so my daughter can work with me as she likes it too. It satisfies my desire to cut and paste using color and stickers. Hoping all the first time infusers have had restful nights. So many struggle with the steroids those first few nights. Finally on the countdown to the end. Yay! Jen - you started back to work this week, how's it going. You sound like things felt normal. For me second week after infusion I decided to get out, ate out carefully like you, no touching condiments, plenty off sanitizer, extra wipe of table before we sat down. Went to a couple movies. Now that I'm retired I envy your job. I volunteer with at risk K-2 age elementary school kids. I'll have to miss the first half of the year, I've never caught their germs before but MO said I definitely would. So instead I've decided to take one closet at a time and clean it out. I'll load up my hubby's truck and send it to Goodwill. Sunnyjay - oh no, how is hubby today? I worry about mine too, he wants to just do everything himself and more. I watch him like a hawk and make him stop doing things. Sigh, don't we love these guys, they so want to help. Happy belated birthday, yum cake! Oh and my nose dripped for about a week after my first infusion, stopped on its own. Hasn't restarted yet. We'll see. runnermom- yes take your meds, it is very hard to catch up once you get behind the nausea game. How did you make out at the game. I crashed early both infusion nights. But if I had a game for one of my kiddos I'd have done it too. Leatherette - it is great really to be on the countdown. I find myself saying \"after my next infusion then two weeks till the last AC. I can't wait. LoJo - I wonder if that is why my WBC was so high, I was on neulasta and steroid and it was checked day 5 and came back 24K. Dropped to 13.5 just before this infusion. Paulette when you say water retention, is that the same as a seroma. My insision healed beautifully I just had to have it aspirated every couple weeks. First time 32cc, then 22 last one 14cc. Last time was just before first infusion. I'd say nothing now. Dmjmom - sounds like a near perfect infusion day. How did the night go? EmilyH - how are you doing now that your A week out? You have 2 weeks to next infusion right? Kim - So sorry for the bone pain, message rebamacfan123 she had the same issue and used epsom salt poultice type things that helped. She posted a lot and is very forthcoming in advice. Don't hesitate. Ok now for the roundup: VL22, lovedormywife, you've had first infusions about a week ago how are you? BUZZBEE, Ping Pong, hopeforthefuture, Sydsym, she, purpleatargazer -Keeping you guys in my prayers, if you're up to it give us an update Enia - your breaking my heart girl, just a little update. Hoping all is well, we miss you! Love and hugs to all. Have a manageable SE day! Mother Hen",

Matryoshka - you had such a good week. Cirque and fireworks, woot! My sister is coming next weekend and I'm so excited to have her. Need to keep up with fun things to look forward too. Proudtospin - yikes is right, no vacuum! Our darn dryer went on the fritz and we're waiting on parts, hopefully soon. Jen - my hair just started dropping like a rock two days after infusion #2. Yes I count infusion day as #1. Dmjmom - enjoy your time with your daughter, mine was away this week, which made me happy as she missed the worst of my SE and now she's back and I'm feeling better. She's 21 and going back next month to finish her senior year and I want her to have a good year without any worries for me. Got on the dreadmill for a bit each day. Later this week it'll be easier and more enjoyable, right now it's ugh! Sunnyjay- I'm also more winded, just noticeably so though, when walking with my hubby, he's got to slow down just a bit. Is you're hubby doing ok? Taking things easier? Leatherette- I still have pretty good taste, I just can't find anything to drink that appeals. I find I just gag down something to keep hydrating. I try to drink soups as they appeal and it's some fluids.

Regarding sleep, I've used the Ativan whenever it was warranted for sleep since chemo. I've never used anything in my whole life, but if I wake in the night and it becomes obvious I'm not going back, I just pop one and off I go eventually. 0.5mg is quite mild, so I usually lie there another little bit before I'm asleep. My MO is all for a restful night so I'll have more energy during the day. Paulette- is your MO against the Ativan? Proudtospin- I'd love a cleaning person, how nice! We've decided to engage a company during my Taxol portion, from what I've read fatigue is worse and I don't want my hubby trying to manage everything. LoJo - I so hope your hives are subsiding. How miserable. I've only experienced it once, have you been able to find something to make it easier to deal with, like a soak or calming lotion? Hopefully the steroids kick in soon. Matryoshka - no food allergies yet, however from reading about LoJo's hives, who knows what's up. Hoping for calm intestines and lessening of rashes. May we all be fortunate to be near a clean bathroom when these sudden urges hit! I too have unpredictable bowels day 7-12. Fun times! ",

I'm 12 days post final rads and only the scar line is red with minor light peeling like from a sunburn. I think in hindsight the worst was the worry about how bad my skin would get and had I known it would only lightly peel I wouldn't have worried one bit about the whole thing. I did have about 5-6 days of real exhaustion, but I just took it easy. Sunny is right though, you definitely have a good eye and should develop that talent. Please continue to post those flowers, can't believe something like that is growing right now, however I love the colors of winter too. The barrenness of the woods behind my house is fascinating too me. I can see so much deeper in now that the foliage is gone. Sometimes I see some cool stuff. LoJo, your trip sounds like a blast and a wonderful way to kick off this new year. The weight we have lifted off our shoulders is hard to put into words, but we all know what it is. Like others have written, this little group has been a godsend, and I also can't put into words what you've meant to me. I'm now looking forward to our trip to Hilton Head in March. Totally a different vibe than New York, but the same feeling of relief. I keep thinking I'll also break into tears when I'm able to walk a nearly deserted beach again, watching the gulls and pelicans and collecting shells. My soul is longing for March 3rd the day we arrive. Sunny, I can't believe you had your 1 month check already, my RO was very personable, but I'm happy to let him go. 🙂 Runnermum, when will your hubby get his scans? Continuing to pray for negative results. I've been awol from here as I've had 4 appointmeets in the last week, all at my cancer center which is a 4hour round trip. I'm beat. However I'm joining a study and starting my AI. The AI will start most likely the end of this week, there's some confusion over wether it should start before or with my study drug. I've also chosen to do the IV drug to protect my bones instead of Boniva, I think it's called Lemita, as there's some evidence it protects against bone mets. I need to get going. Have a great day! Hugs and prayers",

Then the tech spoke over the intercom and said I could call them at any time and they would come right in. It was just what I needed to beat down the anxiety. She was so nice and not the least bit surprised by my fears, so I felt many must feel the same way. Anxious for this to fly by and be over",
