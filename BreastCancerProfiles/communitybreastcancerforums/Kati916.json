No one ever asked me about recon- becus I was part of a \"study.\"  Well 1 wk after my surgery, & being home, I had to go back to hospital with chest wall staph infection, have 2 more surgeries to remove the implants- and right nipple- that they \"now found cancer on\".  I have never been in so much pain in my life, & after talking with a kind, knowlegeable dr, he also suggested I might think about \"no reconstruction.\"  And when I told my ps & breast surgeon this, they both told me to wait before I made that decision.\" Actually I have to wait- until I am healed from the first 3 surgeries- but right now, I am looking forward to living my life to the fullest -& I dont need fake boobs to do it.  I am ME- its been hard to accept, but Ive made it this far, and I hope people love me for who I am- not what I look like.  Thanks for the great article.  PS - I was told by my ps-\" Im their \"1st patient to ever get a staph infection\" after such a procedure.\"  It wasnt ME who gave me that staph infection- sorry i messed up their perfect record!  Feel more like an \"experiment \" to them than I do a patient-- does anyone know- can you change breast cancer drs in mid-course? ",
