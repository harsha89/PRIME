Thanks in advance",

They previously said that the mass in the right breast was oval and now they label it irregular? Also I know that taller than wide is concerning but how about as tall as wide? Also the ultrasound on the left a year ago and then again one month ago identitied only one simple cyst. Now it shows multiple cysts of varying complexities that have grown quite a bit. These cysts are in the breast that has remained swollen (not painful) for 3 months. Could the cysts be causing the swelling as they grow or the reverse (the breast inflammation is causing the cysts to swell)? The surgeon is reviewing the ultrasound results and I have made him aware of my desire to have the larger cyst drained and the one solid mass biopsied. The swelling on the left is uncomfortable but the fluid on the rib under the right breast is painful. The ultrasound tech saw the swelling and asked how long it had been that way (when I told her four weeks she seemed surprised but didn't ask any other questions).Hopefully he will call tomorrow with a recommendation.

Radiologist said cyst is only slightly bigger and has more debris but he recommended no addtl testing. Doctor looked at images and immediately disagreed and sent me to breast surgeon (cyst has a sharp spiculated looking edge But only one side which looks like a tail). Breast continued to swell (increased a whole size) and nipple flattened out (maybe due to swelling?). Met with breast surgeon and he said maybe mastitis (haven't breastfed for over 15 years an no fever). He prescribed cipro and recommended MRI. MRI was approved and I am currently waiting for the 7th day so I can get the MRI. Since the appt with the breast surgeon the swelling has decreased sligntly in both the breast and the armpit . However the nipple is still flattened out and now there is a huge blue vein running to it which makes the bottom of the areola look blue in color. In addition the center of the nipple has a dark red/purplish dot and there are about 8 hair follicles directly beneath the areola that are huge and make that area look pitted.(maybe due to swelling?) Are there specific questions I should ask at the MRI? Should I be concerned over the nipple changes?",

Left breast ultrasound June 20, 2017. TECHNIQUE:  Multiple real time gray scale images were obtained of the bilateral breasts in a survey fashion. FINDINGS: Right breast: In the retroareolar region of the right breast there is an oval hypoechoic lesion measuring 0.6 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm with posterior acoustic enhancement likely representing a cyst. Within the 9:00 position 4 to 5 cm from the nipple there is an irregular hypoechoic lesion measuring 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm without discernible vascular flow, likely corresponding to the enhancing lesion seen on prior breast MRI. Left breast: In the retroareolar region of the left breast there is an ovoid hypoechoic lesion likely representing a cyst measuring 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.9 cm without discernible flow. Adjacent to this, there is a bilobed cyst or cluster of cysts measuring collectively 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm. In the 2:00 position 6 cm from the nipple there is a hypoechoic irregular lesion measuring 0.9 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm without discernible vascular flow. This lesion was seen on prior ultrasound and measured 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm. Within the left axillary region within the area of tenderness there is a patch of hyperdense tissue measuring 4.4 x 1.0 x 3.6 cm with a neighboring vessel. IMPRESSION: 1.  Irregular hypoechoic lesion without discernible vascular flow within the right breast 9:00 position, likely corresponding to the enhancing lesion seen on prior breast MRI. Six-month follow-up with ultrasound is recommended to document stability. 2.  Multiple hypoechoic lesions within the breasts bilaterally, likely representing cysts of varying complexity. Bilateral breast ultrasound in 6 months is recommended to document stability. 3.  Patch of hyperdense tissue within the left axillary region in the area of tenderness without suspicious lesion identified. BI-RADS CATEGORY 3 - Probably Benign Finding(s); short interval follow-up suggested I am familiar with the fact that cysts are B9.  Should I be concerned with the fact that the previous ultrasound said the irregular lesion at the 2 o'clock position was just a simple cyst that measured .9 x .4 x .6 (ultrasound was only one month prior to this).  Now this report says that same are is an irregular hypoechoic lesion and the measurements changed from .9 x .4 x .6 cm to .9 x 1.0 x .06 cm?   Also what does the hyperdense tissue mean? Should I  be concerned with any of these results?   ",

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2017 04:50PM - edited Jul 24, 2017 04:55PM by Tbone23 I had a painful mammogram back on May 5th that caused my breast to be painful at first and then after a few days the pain went away but it started to swell.  It has remained swollen on that one side for over 2 1/2 months. So far there has been no cause identified (waited for a month to see if it was hormonal (it wasn't), had ultrasound to which was clear and tried antibiotics) I should have MRI test results back tomorrow.   I will let you know if there is anything identified on the MRI.   It is soo frustrating since before the Mammogram I was completely fine.
