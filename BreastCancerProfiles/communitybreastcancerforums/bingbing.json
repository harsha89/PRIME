I did without and  I got cramps in my feet when I was doing my excercises for le, nothing really bad but it was there, they went away right away. I probably have to get my body used to excercise again, I do the treadmill, but being on arimidex does a job on my joints, so I don't do it very often. I thought rebounding would be better on my joints and still help with le. thanks  sharon Log in to post a reply",

Love the comraderie spelling ? you guys have going. Something caught my eye and thought you would not mind a question. Leesa you mentioned valtoren jel. After I started arimidex my knees, espedially one hurt when I walked or got up from sitting. Then about 7 months after I started the arimidex my wrist hurt something awful. I already have arthritis where the thumb reaches the wrist. That area anyway. But then I noticed swelling on the top of the hand right by the wrist and awful pain in the knuckles of my hand. I went to ortho dr and he gave me declofanac. Boy did that help, I took it for about  a month and then had my blood checked at my regular onc appt. Found that  my hemoglobun was on the low side one of the side effects of declofanac, so I stopped taking it. I have been good since, except for the area up from the thumb, but I can live with that. However this week I noticed swelling and pain in the wrist area, same as before. I have been waiting for a topical declofanac called pennsaid to be approved by the fda. Supposed to be in August. Didn't know there was another topical declofanac out there. Does voltaren work for reducing pain and inflamation of the joints. I looked it up on internet and was impressed but thought I would ask someone who has first hand expierence before I ask my dr for a prescription. If you would respond i would appreciate.
