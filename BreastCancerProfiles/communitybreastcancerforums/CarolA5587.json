Mine is a little further down the hand from where the IV was inserted. I knew something wasn't quite right with it from the start. I had a little burning. But since that was my first time for chemo I couldn't say stop and let's do something else. Besides that, I really didn't want to delay chemo to stop and put a port in. This was the same vein that was used for surgery. Could be there was a little something left from that. This is day 4 of low grade fever. It's been in the 99's almost consistently. It's pushed the magic 100.5 a couple of times but never quite got there. I feel like it's stealing those good days that I'm supposed to have before I do this again on the 10th. Well, waaaaaaa. My oncologist says that people say that the soul is in the heart. He says, no. When people have their white blood cells go, it is as though they have lost their souls. I'm feeling a little down today. Gardengirl, isn't it funny how you have to convince everyone around you not to be in denial about YOUR hair loss. I've had some of those conversations too! I went to a really short haircut right before the first chemo. Don't know why I didn't do that a long time ago. I have had a lot of compliments on it. Of course the smartass who is ever lurking wants to add something like look fast before this one is gone. I've bought two wigs but I'm not happy with the fit of either one. I don't know if it's because they're not good, or because I'm too critical. My husband's comparison to Tina Turner probably didn't help. :)",

I have friends who want to be there, but they can't handle all of the details. They want to be there; they just can't deal with it all. Just like the hair -I'm wearing a wig when I am going somewhere because I don't want to have to deal with their feelings about my hair loss. And because I am wearing the same wig every day to work, it's like they can pretend it's really my hair not a wig. Getting cynical, I am. I've only had two of these, but I found that I was far LOWER this time than the first time. Maybe because I wasn't able to sleep much for several days. Hope that's not a trend for the treatments.

While talking to my onc about the side effects I suffered with the Neulasta shot, I talked about the hives and how they had been so horrible in my hands. He got a look like a light bulb had gone off. He thinks the hives are a result of the shot. So we decided to forego that this time. If you'll Google Neulasta and hives, you'll see it's one that is mentioned often. I have had the hives a couple of times in my past, but I have never had them go to my hands like that. So far, I have been able to work this week. Waiting for the crash that seems to come in the next day or two. So happy for you that are finishing up! Can't wait to be there!",

At least, I haven't lost that and from what I have read it's common to lose sense of taste. I did lots of pre medication. Started on steroids the day before. Used Claritin. Started on Colace the day of. Listen, this is no time to be a hero. Take it and be kind to yourself. You can do without later. Using Tylenol PM to sleep.

The waaa waaa's have finally receded. Thank goodness. On reactions: My problem seems to be a reaction to Taxotere in my veins. I had an inflamed vein the first time. The infusion felt a little uncomfortable from the start. The second time it was fine until they switched from Taxotere to Cytoxan. My vein screamed and puffed up. So we went to a second vein and you can't even see where that one was. The original vein -different story. It's red and irritated. Nurse told me it is probably not infected, just having allergic reaction. So she prescribed benadryl and aspirin. Anybody else having that kind of issue? I have fought having a port because I am only doing 4 infusions total. I have two left. Now they're talkinga pick. Guess II'm not seeing how that will fix a reaction to the meds. On body image: The process of aging is difficult normally, but when you're doing a process that is essentially aging in warp speed, I think it's a bit much to expect that you're no going to have some issues. It's hard to look in the mirror at this person you don't recognize. Just remember that it's only temporary. You can do this. Do some things that are special. You deserve it.

And it is empowering to know that whatever SE you have to deal with, you are prepared and don't have to rely on some one to go to the store for you. You won't have every SE but you will have some most likely. I took the Neulasta shot after my 2nd treatment. The SE's for me were really bad. Including major depression, deep bone aches, sleeplessness, stabbing joint pain. I elected not to use it this 3rd trip. So far, it's been a better round. This is day 8. I do experience a couple of days that I am not able to function. But I have managed to work most of the time. I haven't seen my surgeon since the post op visit. I'm guessing you won't miss him. Kobrien I have had 3 taxotere infusions and all 3 times I have had a vein reaction. It becomes red and itchy.

I have been at work all week but really felt good this morning. Then about mid morning that wall jumped up again. I was already scheduled to have my white blood cell count taken today. And sure, enough it's dropped way low. Running a low grade fever but not at panic level. So although I wasn't given the Neulasta shot this first go round, it's coming for the next ones. Looks like I also have an infection in the vein where the treatment was given. Happy, happy, happy. On antibiotics for that. Three more rounds to go. We can do this!",

Guess I am also very aware of the way the kids at school look at me even when I change wigs. I just got slammed with a work situation where a coach is being promoted to an administrator position over me, but they'd like for me to help train him. The Roid Rage has been hard to keep in check. I fear showing weakness right now. I had my second infusion Friday and it went fine. But this is definitely a down day. The waaaa waaaa's won't seem to leave me alone. Virginger, I'm sorry you're having dental problems. I have ongoing gum and teeth sensitivity and the chemo definitely doesn't help any of that. Happy belated Mother's Day!",

Funny how we don't hear stuff until it pertains to us. My hives are better today-not gone but better. I start steroids today in prep for round 3 tomorrow. Hoping that will put an end to this. So here's my question for the day: I am interviewing for a job. Do you tell them that you are in the middle of chemo? If yes, should you do that early in the interview, or wait until the end? Kerri, hope you're feeling okay today. This is definitely an up and down process. Hope you have more ups than downs!",

It takes some time so come prepared to entertain yourself for a while. I took steroids the day before, the dau of, and the day after. I started taking Claritin and Colace the day before. I wanted to make very sure I didn't become constipated with this. I also took a B6 starting the day of -dr suggested that to help combat body aches. The Claritin and steroids were also for that. Must have worked. I took a big glass of crushed ice. I'll take even more next time. I think it helps protect your mouth and taste buds. Nurse also suggested buying Vitamin E gel caps. You can open it up and spread it on your gums to fight soreness. I haven't tried it yet but I plan to. Drink lots and lots of fluids all the way through this process. You can't count anything as fluid if it has caffeine. Alas, this southern girl is not getting that sweet ice tea. LOL. I bought Ginger tea because it's supposed to be good for the stomach. Stomach rejected that idea. (Actually it was the taste buds who wanted to know what I was thinking. ) Rosina, what can we say? You go, girl. I'm kind of ready for the hair to go so I can move on and quit worrying about it! I love the idea about the signs. Happy Sunday!",

The first time I was just so tired I couldn't move -had to sleep. The second time I felt like I had the flu for a couple of days as well as being a wreck emotionally. Maybe none of those SE's will get you. You can't worry about them. Just got to be prepared for whatever the chemo train brings you. I haven't lost hair any where besides the top of my head either. Weird, isn't it? If anything, I think the peach fuzz on the side of my face is fuzzier. And I had to shave my legs this morning too. Indenial, hope you have a good 3rd round! I'm not far behind you -and it's not any easier to go do this for me either. I just keep telling myself I'm halfway there. But since it feels like this part of the journey has taken for ever that doesn't give me much comfort. Ladies, hope your SE's all fade away in the night!",

I have found myself filtering for almost every one, including my husband. Heather, I don't know if you are getting the Neulasta shot or not. I only took it once and the SE's from that were so brutal, I didn't go there again. Depression was major. Far worse than without it. Then I developed the hives -and that didn't help my disposition. Tell your doctor about how you're feeling. You aren't crazy and you don't need to do this without help. I know you're tough, but get some help. I have finished the chemo, meeting the RO on Thursday. I had actually hoped to have a few days to enjoy before starting the Rads. I'll be driving 150 miles each day to be zapped. Looks like they'll start Monday. I know, I know. The sooner I start, the sooner I'll be finished. Happy, happy, happy. :)",
