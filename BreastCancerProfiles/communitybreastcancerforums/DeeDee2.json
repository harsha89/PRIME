So i made the decision to have my left breast removed with immediate reconstruction on February 17, 2011 I certainly do not regret my decision. In fact i had my exchange surgery last Tuesday. I'm anxious to see how my breast will look after they are completely healed. As of now the mx'd breast sits a little higher than the one i had lifted. My PS said it will all even out in about six weeks. If not i can always have corrective surgery..... Best wishes to you all",
