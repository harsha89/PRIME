This past fall I went over the visual cliff and was seeing double all of the time, although my near vision was okay. (Near vision=up to 5 feet). I was going to go back to my optometrist and get prism glasses as we had discussed when this first came up. In December I mentioned the problem to my medical oncologist. Wow-brain MRI within four days and a referral to a neuro-ophthomologist. I now have a temporary prism that has been wonderful. The neuro requested an up to date PET scan and a lumbar puncture. The MRI, PET and LP are all negative thankfully. I return to him next week and hopefully he will agree that the double vision is not caused by cancer.",

It is definitely Sixth Nerve Palsy, a neurological problem, but we may never find the cause since it apparently is independent of my Stage IV diagnosis. It may go away or improve or it may stay the same. (If it gets worse I will be back to testing.)The prism has made me \"normal\" again and I could be very happy with this solution long term if things don't improve. The time frame for improvement is about 6 months and I'm still within that period. Good appointment with MO earlier this week-Zometa and Faslodex too. Now to hear about the TMs which have been holding in the low 60s. They have been indicative for me.",
