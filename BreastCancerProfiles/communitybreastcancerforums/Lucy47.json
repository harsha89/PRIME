I find I have more energy now and am feeling pretty much back to normal. I still am taking it slow with the exercise, but it really feels good to be me again.

But because of the size of the tumor I was told that my best opinion would be to have chemo/rads/Tamoxifen. This is all to prevent recurrence. My understanding is that cancer cells are very sneaky, even though it may seem that they got everything. The chemo/rads kill off any possibility of any cancer that may have been missed. Tamoxifen is for estrogen fed tumors and it blocks the estrogen...it can put you into menopause but if you check these boards you will find that a lot of young women did get their periods back. As for numbness ...yes it is true. I am 13 months past surgery and just now have been getting back the feeling in my arm pit and also upper breast. Yes to being able to shave, but try and use an electric shaver...so as not to have any cuts that could result into a infection. Hope this helps. Good luck to you sorry you had to join us ",

Two weeks after the biopsy the results came back neg. to cancer, but my surgeon had already scheduled surgery and he also doesn't believe in keeping any solid mass in the breast. Well when I woke up after surgery I was told it was cancer...... I'm not saying this is the same for you. I'm much older than you  (48 yrs old). Plus I was per-menopause....but if you are worried and this is causing you stress, you need to do what feels right for you. Good luck Lucy",
