Eventually, as the chemicals diminish in your body, the hair starts growing at it's normal rate. Mine came back as thick or maybe thicker than before and somewhat curlier. The curl is gradually going away and it's been almost 2 years. I wouldn't worry, because that may have an affect on things, too. Just take care of yourself - eat right and get plenty of rest. If you are up to it, walking is great. I didn't do that while on chemo, but started it afterwards and it feels great.",
