      "Content": "Jan 9, 2008 02:00AM - edited Jan 9, 2008 02:20AM by Abbysmom1 Hi everyone, I'm pretty late joining this group, having started chemo in October. But just getting smart enough to utilize this resource. I'm a nurse who administers chemo at a local hospital here and have tons of resources and support. However, things are getting harder now and I need to talk with people who are walkin' the walk. I sat up for quite some time last night reading all the posting. Laughed, cried, then laughed some more. Thanks for relieving some anxiety. I slept better. I started with chemo first since there were so many lymph nodes involved per my PET. I finished the first 4 on 1/25, including Taxotere and Xaloda (yuck, won't miss that a bit). Next week I start my 4 cycles of AC. I am also on Avastin as part of a clinical trial I was accepted into. I'm grateful for the trial and its aggressiveness, but some of the side effects are getting a little rough now-sores in mouth, neuropathy, HORRIBLE taste of foods. Can get a girl a little down sometimes. I'm looking at surgery sometime in April or early May. Planning bilat mastectomy (for peace of mind). Will also need radiation due to degree and location of lymph node involvement. I'm bumbed about that, was hoping for expanders and implants. Don't know if I'll do reconstruction. We have a 4 year old I love to play with. Don't want to be restricted by those limitations for quite some time. Anyway, that's it in a nut shell. Sorry for the long note, but thanks for indulging me!! I'm looking forward to getting to know you better. Have a great day. I'm plannning a walk. It's sunny and nearly 70 degrees! Oh, did I mention that I live in Ohio. Crazy, wonderful weather for us here P.S.  My hubby helped me establish a web address to keep friends and family updated. That's where I post most pictures. There's no cost for it, so consider it if you have lots of family spread around. It's been a great vehicle for sharing my journey.  www.breastcancerstories.com/abbysmom.",

After all, my family and I are equally changed by this. Our life will be forever different, better in many ways, but different. So, a journey it is. Cheryl, it's pretty windy here now. Kansas, here we come! I hope your fever stays down. I ran a temp with bronchitis for 2 weeks before christmas. The Onc doc threatened to admit me if it went over 100.5 but it always managed to stay below that. make sure you take in plenty of fluids if you can, that will help with the temp. Otherwise, we'll just pray that you get well, the fever goes away and takes the aches with it. Sometimes chemo just stinks, but I have found over the past 3 months that the really yucky days don't last long. Tomorrow will almost certainly bring a better day for you. Hang in there. Theresa",

And Abby, well, she is my big dose of motivation every day. I love being a nurse, working at the same hospital for 17 years. My husband is also a nurse. We're lucky that we made a lot of connections and friends over the years. We took advantage of that when I was diagnosed. But, I will tell you that all the nursing experience in the world didn't prepare us for this. I did OK with treatments, my attitude and outlook until last week. The side effects of the chemo are getting to me, can't hardly stand it sometimes. It feels like surgery is forever away and, at this moment, don't know how to get through 3 more months of chemo. I'm weak, tired and haven't worked in 6 weeks. Sometimes it's easy to feel like cancer can take everything from you when you aren't looking. My big concern lately is reading about all the possible long-term side effects of the AC that is coming up. I also worry about radiation and what it will do. See, being a nurse and having that knowledge just doesn't matter sometimes when you are the one walking the walk. I'm of much better use when its me taking care of someone else. The good thing is....I have my family, and tomorrow always brings something good. Sleep tight everyone. Cheryl, take care of that fever. Blessings. Theresa ",

It certaintly couldn't be that we're fighting life-threatening diseases while juggling families, work and everything else, could it. Cheryl, sounds like you were pretty sick. I hope you're feeling better. That low bp itself would make you feel lousy. Texas Karen-I also feel like this journey is too darn long. I am three months into chemo with 3 more months to go. Then I still have surgery and radiation after that. It looks like October or November before I can actually be done with treatment. That will be a whole year. It really makes me mad sometimes that a whole year will past doing something so crappy. But then I remind myself that I'm doing this so I have many, many good healthy years with my family and friends. Time passes quickly, so hopefully, we will look behind us some day and say \"it sucked for a while, but now it really doesn't seem so bad\". Or......something like that. Karen R, I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm also thrilled you are considering school. I love being a nurse, having done it for almost 17 years now. It's hard work and you certainly can't do it for the money, but I feel good doing it. I think going back to school when you're more mature makes you a better sutdent and nurse. Life experience gives us a compassion we can't find any other way. Girls, I have a question: I just finished Taxotere and Xaloda. The treatment was rough, cummulatively speaking. Now, I start AC next week and am nervous about it. I'm trying to sort out the messages from all of you to find out what you think, but if you could remind me of your experience, I would appreciate it. I've been reading about the side effects and long term effects and am freaking myself out. Thanks for any insight you have. Happy Friday and hope you have something to laugh and smile about this weekend. Theresa",

I had to have a good cry because your positive energy just jumps out of the computer and hugs me. Sounds silly, but true. TexasKaren - your poem on ending chemo si fantastic. You are all fantastic. I'm still battling some nausea today, but no vomiting for 24hours. Thank God. I am pushing fluids and sleeping a lot. My hubby took great care of me this weekend and Abby was so good. I'm glad a new week is here. Lisa, hang in there with the taxol. The numbness does go away after treatment. By the time I started the AC, 3 weeks after my last taxotere dose, the numbness was significantly better. You can do this. Lori, thanks for words of encouragement. I just dread the nausea and vomiting more than other symptoms. Don't know why. Anyway, your positive words helped a lot :) Ulla, I can only imagine your anxiety. I still have a few treatments to go. Then surgery and radiation comes next. I guess one good thing about chemo is that is is nearly a full-time job and keeps us busy. But, I think there is so much more out there for us. We just forgot temporarily about \"regular life\". I'm reading this book right now titled, \"There's no place like hope\" by Vickie Girard. It's just a little book with tidbits of wisdom and lessons learned. It's easy reading for my chemo brain. Anyway, there is a section titled \"Treatment's over\". Here is a thought she shared on ending treatment: \"My suggestion is to simply remind yourself that you have done all that was asked of you and more. Every athlete, entertainer, or musician wonders if they have practiced enough as they are about to step out on the field or stage - but they go right ahead and step out there anyway. The same is true for us. There comes a time when every cancer sirvivor must simply step out the door and do it -and for us, the \"it\" is to live!\" You have prepared, Ulla, for the best performance of your life. Go out and enjoy the show! Much love girls. have a great monday.",

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2008 12:28AM - edited Jan 10, 2008 12:29AM by Abbysmom1 Good morning ladies! I woke up with a lot of wind blowing around the house, but the sun is shining onto the couch. What a glorious start to my day. I really loved reading all the comments. I'm trying to catch up and get to know who is who. Nikki, the hydration idea is a great one, but unfortunately, insurance won't let us do anything at home. It's all about that \"not being home-bound\". My hubby takes care of me in every other way, though. Texas Karen-Nikki is right about who gets what when. It's based on the diagnosis and extend of disease (at least that has been my experience). My oncologist recommended chemo first as soon as we found I had significant lymph node involvement (per PET). He explained it this way: if I had surgery first, then chemo, we would not really be able to evaluate how well the chemo is working on the smaller amounts of cancer remaining in my body. However, with chemo first, he can monitor the shrinking of my tumor. If the tumor is shrinking, then we can be nearly certian it is killing the microscopic stuff that may have landed somewhere else. My surgeon and rad Onc all agreed. It made sense. But, I also see lots of ladies with local tumors, clean nodes per PET who go directly to surgery. Some don't have chemo at all. So, I guess they tailor it to fit your best interest. There's no right or wrong way to proceed. I'm also interested in the nutritional aspect of things. I know enough about nutrition for the average Joe, but not where this cancer thing is concerned. I think we will all appreciate what you have time to share. Happy Wednesday, everyone. Theresa",

Sorry everyone has the blues right now. It will be so much easier when spring gets here. Gloomy days just don't help much, do they? I have my first AC treatment this week. Feeling a little nervous about it. The taxotere was rough enough and I'm waiting to see what this brings. The doctor prescribed emend for nausea with the AC. Has anyone taken this? It's a 3-pill pack that I start the day of treatment. I'm guessing the nausea must be more profound than with the taxotere. Carolyne, I'm glad your second taxol treatment went better for you. Hope the new med helps, too. Texas Karen, great to learn about the mag and vit b info. I had quite a bit of trouble with neuropathy in fingers and feet with the taxotere. No one mentioned that before in my onc office. Would have loved to try it earlier. Interesting that several of you are having 12 treatments of taxotere. I had 4, every 3 weeks. Then the AC. Thanks, too, for the book info. I ordered it today. Karyll, hope you are adjusting to being home. I haven't worked for about 7 weeks. It was strange at first, but then I found I had energy to do the things I wanted to. I didn't realize how tired I was after work until I wasn't working. I was definitely more interactive with my family and friends. I am going back to work Feb 1st and kinda wish I was staying home longer. I need to make my STD last since I still have surgery and radiation to finish. Enjoy the time, do what you like to do. Pamper yourself :) For those growing hair, you go girls!! I can't wait until mine starts to come back. I always had very fine hair, straight as an arrow. I always complained that I couldn't do a darn thing with it. But, oh how I miss that hair now. I don't cry too often about this journey, but I do get tearful at times in the shower when I don't need to reach for the shampoo. It's just not right, not natural. Sometimes there isn't much to make me feel very feminine. I'm excited for you all! Well, I know I haven't addressed all the posting, but I have a doctor's appointment and am still in my pjs. Hope the day brings at least one good thing for each of you and those you love. Peace and all that good stuff, ladies. Theresa",

I must admit to the thought of pushing a few people off a bridge, so don't worry (just don't let anyone see you do it :). My treatments will continue to be on Thursdays. I was hoping to work on Fridays, then take a 3-day weekend and return on Tuesdays. Thanks for your input on the stool softeners. Lori, glad things are settling down. God does hear our prayers, doesn't he? Kara, your brain fog story cracked me up. Just today, I put a bag of sugar in the refrigerator and put the butter in the cupboard. Boy, if I only had a dollar for every time I did that (lol). Good thing we can laugh at ourselves, isn't it. Do you think anyone else is laughing at us....hmmmm. Anyway, I really enjoy reading your posts everyone. There sure is power in numbers. Sorry if I missed anyone. I think the Ativan is kicking in. Time for bed. Bless you all. Theresa",

Felt great for a few hours, then developed the worst headache of my life around 3pm, started vomiting by 3:30. First time I've ever thrown up since I started chemo. It was discouraging. Today, I feel kinda hung over. Took the Emend this morning (second of three doses) but the ONC also told me to take the Zofran every 4-6 hours for a few days. The headache is better, but still afraid to eat anything. Sipping on tea now. I just feel really tired and ready to sleep some more. Sorry, but I feel like a good cry. Hope this isn't what the AC is going to be like each time. I hate the throwing up, can handle everything else. Anyway, blah, blah, blah. I catch up on reading later. Just thought I'd check in with my buds. Hope you're all doing OK. I've come to care about all of you rather quickly and you are always on my mind. I'll be back!! Theresa",
