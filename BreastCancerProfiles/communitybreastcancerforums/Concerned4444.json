Totally freaking out. No history of bc in my family. No pain or noticeable lumps. I do have cysts and dense breast tissue. I'm 46 y/o.

I know how ridiculous this sounds but I'm thinking quitting smoking and drinking will be necessary and difficult to quit if I fall in the 20th percentile after my test and results. Please don't judge or advice, I'm looking for responses from people who can relate Log in to post a reply",
