Am on antibiotics after the positive culture and the surgeon removed my port 2 weeks ago. The site was left open, and I'm doing wet to dry dressings (Ouch!) twice daily. Can't get chemo \"until infection is gone -at least 2 weeks\" per surgeon. Wound specialist chuckled at 2 week estimate. How long can your chemo be interrupted without a problem? It's now been 5 weeks and my hair is starting to grow back (ALL 'white', but that's another issue altogether; planned port placement on the other side is yet another). I feel great. The onc's office called to cancel my labwork and the nurse asked, \"You've completed your chemo, right?\" HELP. I'll ask again-How long can your chemo be interrupted without a problem? Thanks in advance for your answers and sharing your experiences. ...for we walk by faith, not by sight...
