I was hoping since my cancer was caught so small and no + nodes,  I could escape chemo, but Oncotype DX was 34.  I am terrified, but we all will get through this with the help and prayers of you brave ladies !   Guess I'll be wig shopping this weekend, Hope I can find one to fit my big noggin. Keeping you all in my thoughts",
