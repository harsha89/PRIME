    "Content": "Oct 8, 2007 07:13AM - edited Oct 8, 2007 07:13AM by JudyWI I had to stop because of the chemo side effects. I made it thought 6 of the A/C, don't know how it was very hard,  and only one Taxol. It came to either I died from the treatment or the treatments shorten my life or stop and take my chances of the cancer showing up again in the next few years.  Chemo is like a crap shot they are hitting you with drugs incase some cancer cells have moved not all do.  And even if the cancer has moved chemo doesn't always work. So in my case I had a grade 3 which has a higher rate of return and it was ER + so decided to take the hormone treatment for the next 5 years and hope the chemo I made it though and the hormone pills will keep any cancer knocked down.  Some times you have to decide what is right for you now.  I am 57 and who know what they may come up with in the next years to help treat our breast cancer. I am 8 weeks out from my last chemo and my counts are still way too low and I still have to watch my health.  I wonder if I will ever get back to what was normal before. ",
