Nothing was surprising, my score really was a 4 and the tumor was extremely estrogen and progesterone positive. She wants me to lose weight as fat cells make estrogen.

I am down to 5 boosts now. Under my breast got really bad with blisters and raw red skin. I received a 3 day break from rads because of it. It has been about a week 1/2 since I had the break and it is healing really well. Just one small spot that is still red and weeping. Under my arm is peeling but never was wet and doesn't hurt at all.

Yikes, I used this skin repair cream that the doctor recommended that is made by Medline. I do admit that I also used some Aquaphor on my nipple when it started to get bad as the Aquaphor is so thick it stayed on and didn't soak in like the other lotion. In addition, when my burn got really bad, they prescribed silvadene cream that worked really well to heal those areas. I also got some 100% aloe that seemed to help too. I am about a week and half out from the end of rads and am doing really well. Everything is healing well, the peeling is still happening but not bad now. Even the plucked chicken look is going away slowly. ",

The nurse recommended letting the area \"air out\". I laughed at her and told her I would have to stand on my head to do that! She laughed and suggested duct tape. I am down to 11 treatments to go, 6 whole breast and 5 boosts. I'm so tired I can barely function at this point. I sleep all weekend and go to bed at like 7 pm on weekdays. I can't remember the last time I actually cooked a meal. Under my arm by my SNB incision is very red though not too sore. The skin under my breasts is extremely red and hurts like the devil. Plus I have this itchy rash all over my chest and down my cleavage. At this point, nothing is helping any of it. I just keep telling myself that I am almost done and that each treatment is killing any lingering cancer cells. My family and friends keep telling me how strong I am. These days I don't feel that strong. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry for a few hours. MarieBernice - I had a little bit of pinkness and heat (my breast felt hot) right after treatment during the first few weeks. It went away though by the next morning. It really is early for you to be having side effects. Are they using a bolus on you? That can make the skin side effects happen faster and be more intense. I would definitely show the nurse or doctor when you see them next. I have to say, I am extremely fair skinned (imagine a red head's skin) and they have been amazed at how well my skin has held up. :)",

Each person is really different though so just be prepared for the worse and hope for the best. :) Strongenough - I was the same way with the bras because of how bad the area under my breast got. I actually bought sleep bras where the band came down further. I just purchased some Genie Bras and they are basically the same thing. They don't support quite as well but at least it isn't rubbing against the raw tissue. I also took a small wash cloth and rolled it up and placed it under there when I couldn't have the burn cream on it. That seemed to help the raw skin rubbing against each other. I haven't been able to really go braless for any period of time since my lumpectomy. I need at least a little support. I do have to say that I am now healing really well and beginning to actually feel somewhat back to normal again. I did start the tamoxifen yesterday. No side effects yet.",

It was a lovely way to spend Christmas. We got up opened presents and went right back to bed. I finished radiation on 12/2 and started my tamoxifen on 12/3 so I've been taking it almost a month now. So far I haven't had any SEs. I have had hot flashes but I was getting those before. I am just having my first period since starting it and it hasn't been any worse or better than before. My breast is basically looking almost normal now. Still a few \"quilling\" areas and it is still peeling a little but it is definitely looking much better. I'm back to wearing regular bras though I still can't go braless when I sleep or at home like I used to. I'm sure it will come in time. I had the same soreness in my rib area too after radiation and I just noticed yesterday that it didn't hurt there. My arm still gets stiff and I need to stretch but not bad. KKay, I was sure I would get every SE under the sun with the tamoxifen. I wasn't worried about the weight gain as I'm already overweight and though the MO wants to see me lose weight, I can't see it happening in the near future. I was worried about all the other side effects, the hot flashes, the bad painful periods, etc that I had heard about. As I already have been having all of these things, I was sure it was about to get much worse. Luckily, as I say above, I haven't really had any SEs so my worrying was for nothing.",

I try to have a good attitude about it but I just am feeling the need today to have a pity party for myself.  I feel like I'm managing a day care center not a data center with how people are acting at work, I hurt, I'm tired and didn't sleep well last night which makes it worse.  Throw in some PMS just for fun and things suck right now.  LOL I know I'll survive and this will all pass eventually.  Just doesn't feel like it today.",

      "Content": "Nov 18, 2014 08:22AM - edited Nov 18, 2014 08:25AM by jeanelle Hi everyone! Well the RO did not put me on another break from the radiation but did spread them out a bit more. I will finish my 4 whole breasts treatments this week (M-TH) and get a 3 day break over the weekend. Next week I'll have my first 3 boosts with a 4 day break over the holiday weekend and then my last 2 boosts the following Monday and Tuesday. I'm happy with that. Even though I think it looks terrible under my breast and now my nipple area is peeling, the nurse and doctor say it looks great. The itching I was having which I thought was a reaction to the cream is healing they say. All the dry dead skin is falling off and leaving very raw red skin which they say is the new skin. I am still all for the breast levitation device. :) My skin issues are the worse under my breast and then around my nipple. I also noticed a small spot around my SNB scar that is starting to peel. One of the women who was going through radiation at the same time had problems with the skin under her arm. It was a bit sad for me yesterday. There were 4 of us going through radiation at the same time, all a bit staggered in when we actually started. We decided that we were going to put our handprints in a circle like we were all holding hands. Yesterday when I went in I saw that the third of us had finished hers last week and I missed it. Today it is off to see the MO to find out about the next step which i assume will be Tamoxifen. After that appointment I'm off to radiation. I was going to go back to work but I think I may just head home afterwards. Thank you all for being so supportive here! *hugs* Jeanelle",

That area keeps growing larger but the doctor and nurse say it is a sign of it healing so I'll live with that. It hurts but not as bad as the blisters. Anyways, only 2 more whole breasts to go. The boosts will be by my incision which is just barely above my nipple so my nipple will get hit then but at least it is only 5 treatments and the underside and under my arm will have time to heal. :) Homemom, we finish on the same day now. :) No bell here but I'll get a certificate and put my handprint up on the wall. Also, am I the only one that feels like all we do is go to doctor appointments? I live relatively close to the hospital (20 minutes). I don't know how some you ladies do it driving an hour or more for treatment.",

I am almost done with only 4 more boosts to go. It itches like the devil and I found benedryl cream and also aloe with lidocaine helped relieve that. I was told this is very common. I also have some pretty straight lines. They are pretty exact with the treatment area. Everyone's side effects are different. Some people like Peggy just get a little red/pink others get worse. I had a pretty bad burn under my breasts that caused them to give me a small break and then spread out my remaining treatments a bit. Now it really isn't that bad. My skin is red/black/purple and the black skin is peeling away to reveal healthy new pink skin. Other than a small still weepy spot under my breast and sore ribs, it doesn't even really hurt anymore. It really does look a lot worse than it actually feels. All of us can get through this. We just need to take it one day at a time and try to remember that this is killing the cancer.

That lovely seroma has found a way to drain itself through my nipple and the \"scab\" was actually the discharge from the seroma. They drained the seroma once because I was having a lot of pain with it. However, it has filled up again and goes up and down in size causing me discomfort when it is full. I just keep cleaning off the nipple when the build up gets to be too much. It doesn't just wash off in the shower. Good luck in diagnosing yours. Jeanelle",

After surgery, I would put a very soft washcloth under my arm to keep them from rubbing together and irritate the SNB incision. I had my follow-up with the RO yesterday. It went really well. They are amazed at how well I am healing. I'm down to having just a couple large brown spots that are peeling along with my nipple still being sore and peeling. It is beginning to look almost normal again. :) Now I just need to break up the large amount of scar tissue under my breast incision. I hope everyone is doing well!",
