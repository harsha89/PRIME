I went to gym this morning, trying to get all in I can before the 8th.  I really really am trying to keep my spirit up.  IMy spirit is important to me and I do not want this to cause me to loose my spirit.  I have the Christmas decorations down, I have a sense of urgency to \"get things done.\"  I am headed out to find me shorts for under the \"gown\".  I will spend the next week or so preparing physically and mentally.  All of you are angels, it helps so much to be able to come here to vent and talk. ",

I would love to know what to take to the hospital also.   I have gotten some button up pjs, as I know it will be difficult for pullover and slippers.  For now, I am just trying to prepare myself mentally. ",
