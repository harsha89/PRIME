For the first time that I am aware of, my onc tested my CEA.  It came back at 0.8 with normal being up to 2.5.  I don't know if this is telling us anything because I don't have a frame of reference for this test, other than knowing the top end of normal.  And I know that it's commonly used to track colon cancer treatment with breast cancer being an \"also ran\".  If your oncologist runs a CEA and CA27.29, how do yours compare?  Do they track with each other?  I think it might be possible to have a cancer that doesn't express the protein measured by the CEA test.  And if that is the case, the results would be meaningless.  I'm being treated at Dana Farber and I don't think they'd run this particular test if they felt it held no validity.  But I don't want to get my hopes up for nothing.  Any test that comes back in the normal range makes me hopeful.

      "Content": "LuvRVing wrote: When I was in Boston for the Komen Race, they had a health expo set up the evening before the race.  There was a group demonstrating the L-Dex technology, which can measure a woman's risk of developing lymphedema.  I was curious about this, even though I am statistically at very low risk according to my breast surgeon.  I let them test me, which was an interesting process.  Someone has a picture of me on the table having this done.  They hooked up leads to both arms and my right foot (opposite of my BC side) and mea­sure­ments were made by pass­ing a harm­less elec­tri­cal sig­nal of very low strength from the L-Dex device through my arm. Both arms were mea­sured and the whole pro­ce­dure took only min­utes to complete. It works like this:  The elec­tri­cal sig­nal trav­els through the fluid sur­round­ing the cells which make up the mus­cle and tis­sue of the arm. The amount of this fluid increases as lym­phedema devel­ops.  Increased fluid means the elec­tri­cal sig­nal will travel more eas­ily through the arm. An L-Dex device com­pares how eas­ily the elec­tri­cal sig­nal trav­els in the unaf­fected ver­sus the affected (or at-risk) arms and gen­er­ates an L-Dex value from this comparison. My score was a 4, which was well within normal range and indicates I am not at high risk.  If I had scored above 10, I would want to work with a lymphedema therapist and take precautions such as wearing a compression sleeve when flying.  As you know, preventing lymphedema is easier than treating it once it occurs.  For more information, go to     http://www.l-dex.com/  I hope this helps someone.

I find it hard to hate the \"pink\" even though I don't think it really raises awareness.  We are certainly aware; and I suspect the general public is aware that breast cancer exists and that mammograms can help discover breast cancer.  What doesn't happen is enough discussion about the cold, hard realities of breast cancer.  I hate that Komen pimps out \"For the Cure\" to companies who are donating tiny percentages of their revenues for cheap \"made in some other country\" products and then spends some of that money including our donations in lawsuits to defend their trademark \"For the Cure\". That is a damn shameful waste of money. And Komen is sometimes clueless in who they allow in the program...Kentucky Fried Chicken and pink buckets? Perfumes made with products that are suspected of being carcinogens? I hate that companies say they are donating a portion of their proceeds for breast cancer research, without indicating which organization gets the money, how much the total donation is likely to be.  We need to hold those organizations accountable.  We, ourselves, hide some of the realities.  We wear head covers because we are worried about what people will think if they see a bald head.  In this instance, I think we are our own worst enemy.  We could do more to raise awareness by this one single act than any pink ribbon campaign or silly Facebook breast cancer 'confuse the guys' game.    If the NFL wants to raise awareness, bring in a stadium full of us baldies, put US in pink tshirts so the world can see us, and give us placards that spell out \"DONATE FOR RESEARCH TO CURE BREAST CANCER\" or simply \"WE NEED A CURE FOR BREAST CANCER!\"  Pink armbands, towels and other uniform accoutrements on NFL players...not so much.  But how do you argue with their intentions? I cannot be upset when my family gives me pink things - they are thinking of me. I cannot be upset that my daughter is organizing a large family contingent to walk in the Komen Race for the Cure in Boston in late October. Everything is done in the name of love and support, and I appreciate every single act.  I wear my pink ribbon gear.  And I think the Martina McBride song, a tribute to those who support each and every one of us, is beautiful.  Our caregivers and loved ones are not often considered outside of our immediate world.  So kudos to her for taking a true story and turning into a song of awareness and love.  It's not a perfect world and we need to keep chipping away at the things we find objectionable. Revolution, not evolution. Michelle",

We moved to the Kansas City area in 1994 and we took several RV trips in Class A motorhomes (borrowed or rented) and just loved it.  While we felt very landlocked, we were within two days of many of our great national parks, and so we took advantage of it.  We've been to the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, Zion, Bryce, Land Between the Lakes, Carlsbad Caverns, Crater Lake and Yosemite, just to name a few.  So now I am \"retired\" - well, got on SSDI last October.  But DH needs to work a bit longer, although this news has thrown him into the \"gotta do it soon\" mode.  My daughter asked me what was on my bucket list and I told her, among other things, spending a month in Alaska and visiting Yellowstone.  And we are back in NH where I was born and where our entire family lives, so we would enjoy camping in the mountains or near the ocean with our children and grandchildren.",

Not likely to see that change, but I guess it happens on rare occasions. I'll get scanned after a couple of months to see how things are going and then I'll either stay the course if it's working, or I'll move on to Carboplatin. Fortunately, my insistence on tumor marker testing and subsequent PET/CT scan resulted in catching these mets early in the game. I have a very small tumor load, and the naughty nodes are so small that she couldn't feel them. My family is feeling a bit relieved, and we'll deal with what comes, as it comes.

Karen - your description of how they enter the room is pretty accurate. Because of the position I have to stay in for the treatment, my head is turned away from the 8 inch rad-proof door.  So I hear something that I now realize is the door open, I turn my head, and there he is, the mad scientiest aka physicist, geiger counter in hand.  He looks at me and announces \"you're OK\" and the rest of the team appears.  They say it's a \"triple\" check because they can monitor radiation levels within the room.  In any case, it reminds me of old movies of the 50's and 60's when we really worried about nuclear war and you saw enactments of what it would be like in an aftermath...guys in white radiation-proof suits with geiger counters measuring fallout levels.    And they told me they do have a \"pecking order\" for who goes in first, but so far it's been the same older guy each time.  I am grateful that I will not likely suffer any of the skin irritations many of you are experiencing.  But with what will end up being 13 CT scans and 10 treatments, I wonder if I'm getting \"less\" total rad exposure than the rest of you.  At least they figured out that if they massaged my boob first, it would make contact with the balloon and they'd only need one scan.  My heart goes out to those of you suffering burns and other SE's...ouch, ouch!  Sending positive healing thoughts to all of you!

Claritin - I took generic claritin, not the \"D\" formula.  You don't need the decongestant and it will just add to the jitters if you're also taking lots of steroids.  I took it on the morning of the Neulasta shot and for three days afterwards. Steroids - talk to your oncologists about whether or not you really need to take steroids for several days.  I just went through 8 treatments of DD AC/T and I got just 6 mg of Decadron on treatment day as part of my pre-meds.  I took no other steroids at all.  I am diabetic, and that was one thing we discussed to be sure my blood sugar level stayed in check.  Steroids can help if you are having lots of nausea, but you may not need those multi-day doses.  By the way, I got treatment at a Dana Farber center.  For heartburn - ask your oncologist about taking generic Prilosec (omeprazole) if you're on AC and generic Pepcid if you are on any kind of Taxane (Taxol, Taxotere, Abraxane).  I took Prilosec the whole time I was on AC and then added the Pepcid when I started on Taxol.  It helps immensely!  I did find that I had to minimize spicy foods and carbonated beverages.  Yeah, right now I am taking about 20 pills a day and according to my onc, I can start to wean off some of this stuff in two months.  By that time, the chemo effects should be wearing off.  And remember...keep drinking.  The more you drink, the sooner you flush out the nasty drugs and the nasty chemo taste.  Hugs to all of you!

Stjude - I hope you can get your blood sugars in control. Because I am diabetic, my steroid dosage with dose dense AC was just 6 mg on treatment day and none on any other days. Try talking to your onc about giving this minimal dosage a try.  If you're not having any excessive nausea issues, 6 mg may be enough. Small frequent meals got me through treatment and kept me mostly nausea-free.  Even now, I am still not able to eat a \"normal\" portion of food.  I didn't gain any weight during chemo, actually lost a couple of pounds.  Anyone (and especially you diabetics) who will be taking Taxol or Taxotere should discuss with your oncologist some supplements to prevent neuropathy.   Here is a link to a Phase 3 clinical trial using acetyl-l-carnitine for prevention.  I took it on my own and have not had a problem at all: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00775645 I also have taken L-Glutamine and Vitamin B6.  I discussed these with my oncologist and she supported my taking these supplements.

It's easy to look up results from labwork and learn to understand what the numbers mean.  Just another part of getting your PhD in Breast Cancer Studies Michelle",

Regarding what I brought to the chemo center...I could have brought nothing because they had everything I needed, from snacks and lunch, to drinks, to warm blankets, to a nice flat screen tv mounted on the wall.  I brought my laptop (they had wireless) and a large container that we kept filled with the beverage of my choice.  At my center, you didn't need to bring much of anything.  You'll need to figure out what your center has to offer, which you may find out during chemo training.  And I brought someone with me each and every time.   I would not have wanted to drive home after chemo because I was tired and I was woozy.  My chemo nurse administered any pre-meds that I needed the first time.  Afterwards, the only \"pre-med\" that I did myself was the scopolamine patch.  Everything else was provided.  I had compazine and ativan at home for breakthrough nausea, but there was no expectation that I would bring in any other meds.  If you suffer from migraines or some other problem that might require something they don't have, then you should bring it along.  I also carried my copies of lab reports so that I could compare results from one session to another.  My chemo nurse was excellent at getting answers to any of my questions about all those \"High\" or \"Low\" values that showed up time after time.  I learned which ones were relevant and which ones were no big deal.  I know it seems like a long road, and it is.  But the day you get the news that you are cancer-free, you'll look back on the low points and know you fought a winning battle.

Note...Neulasta should be brought to room temperature before the injection.  And the injection should be done slowly.  These two tips will make the injection less painful.  Otherwise, that little sucker can hurt.

I received the following \"pre-meds the day of treatment:  50 mg of IV benadryl (which was reduced to 25 after the first Taxol treatment without an allergic reaction); IV Pepcid; IV Aloxi; 1 Emend tablet and 6 mg of Decadron - tablets).  They don't normally give the Emend and Aloxi for nausea, but it had worked well for me with AC and we decided not to change anything.  I took the Emend for the following two days.  I took generic Pepcid every day during Taxol to cut down on reflux.  Occasionally I supplemented with a Tums or two.  I was also taking generic Prilosec so I had all the bases covered.  Taxol irritates a different acid generator than the one affected by AC, so that is why my center administers the IV Pepcid.  The 6 mg of Decadron is the only steroids that I got each treatment.  I didn't take any the day before or days after. The IV benadryl made me groggy for an hour or so during treatment.  It knocks out many people and you might just end up napping through the whole thing.  I never slept, just slurred my speech like a drunk person for that hour...lol.  Also, my Taxol IV drip took 3 hours in addition to the time it took for my exam, lab work and pre-meds.  My whole time at the center was at least five hours, so don't be surprised if yours takes a long time.  A slow drip helps prevent allergic reactions.  I was on dose dense, you weekly Taxol gals will be much quicker.  I took Claritin the day I got Neulasta (the day after treatment) and the next four days.  My \"worst\" days with Taxol were days 4 and 5, where I really noticed joint aches and pains.  I already take Meloxicam for arthritis, so I took a couple of Tylenol if it got bad enough to keep me from sleeping.  I had to be careful, though, because Taxol elevated my liver enzymes a bit - I think it was the second treatment that we noticed it.  But at the third one, they had returned to the normal range.  Just be aware that it might happen to you.  And remember to keep up your hydration.  My eyelashes and eyebrows held on during AC, but by the last Taxol treatment they were all gone. ",

The clinical trial for supplements to prevent neuropathy with Taxanes (Taxol, Taxotere or Abraxane) is using Acetyl L-Carnitine.  I took it along with the L-Glutamine and B6.  I thought about icing my fingers and toes, but decided that I couldn't sit there with ice on my extremities for three hours, so I didn't do it.  I might have tried it if I had done weekly Taxol.   I had a bit of neuropathy in my feet (tingling) when I would get up after sitting for a while, but it is gone.  Yes, you're not going to eat those peas so I'm sure you can refreeze them.  I wonder if lima beans would stay frozen longer? I have had only 8 rads treatments so far.  I am using Moisturel cream because I already had it, and it was on the list of recommendations from my radiation team.  Many people use Aquaphor and they swear by it although they complain that it's greasy.  Moisturel does not leave a greasy film - I've used it as my face cream for 20+ years so I have a lot of experience with this product.  It's hard to find in stores and I usually order it from Amazon or Drugstore.com.   I haven't had any skin reactions yet, but it's a little soon so only time will tell if the Moisturel was the \"best\" option for me. Terry - good luck today.  The worst will be the drain - it's a bit of a pain to deal with.  I didn't find my BMX to be nearly as painful as I thought it would be.  Wishing you a complication-free surgery and recovery!

Another clinical trial involving metformin is as a replacement for tamoxifen or an AI.  The thought is that it could be used with TNBC as a long term preventive.  Linda is right, the drug is crazy cheap.  If you need to lose a few pounds, it will probably help you.  If you have insulin resistance or are pre-diabetic, it will help.  If you have polycystic ovaries, it will help.  Metformin can cause a bit of GI distress at first.  Usually doctors will start you on a low dose and then gradually increase it as your system adjusts. I haven't seen any recent results of the clinical trials.  I wish they would publish some interim statistics.  Michelle",

The live virus must be kept frozen, I think, until just before administering or it will die.  I paid my $15 copay for the clinic and my insurance covered the cost of the vaccine at 100%.  I was told that if they didn't cover it, the cost would be approximately $275.  The administering of the vaccine is covered under Medicare rules which complicates things.  Even though my PCP could administer the flu and pneumonia vaccines, she couldn't give me the shingles vaccine.  Seems sort of stupid, and maybe this will change if they've lowered the recommended age to 50.  In any case, if I were a newly-diagnosed breast cancer patient, I would BEG for the vaccine before beginning any treatment.  It may be only 50-60% effective, but that's no worse than most of the other drugs we BC ladies are willing to accept. My mom and her best friend suffered with shingles a couple of years ago.  Her friend got it in her ear canal and suffered with vertigo for months, and was left with a permanent hearing loss.  My mom had it for 3 or 4 months, and it was painful.  It's nothing to mess around with, and if you can get the vaccine, I highly advise doing so.

If your mom is able to understand and make decisions, then she needs to weigh in on the decision.  If it were my mom, I would not want her to endure adjuvant chemo for a possible 3% benefit.  I think I'd want her to do rads and try Herceptin to see how she tolerates it, and then hormone therapy if she can tolerate it without too many side effects.   It's a difficult decision, and you are correct...there's not a lot of data out there.   You might want to check this publication from the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  It's more about older diabetics and chemo, but there might be something that helps you. http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/27/13/2170 Unfortunately, there are no easy answers.  At 70, quality of life is really important.

      "Content": "Sep 29, 2011 07:17AM LuvRVing wrote: Hi ladies!  I am just popping in from the June chemo group.  I had my last treatment yesterday and if you want, you can check out my blog for pictures on chemo and how mine went. www.mch-breastcancer.blogspot.com A few words of advice, which I hope will help: 1.  Drink, drink, drink...anything that tastes good to you.  Aim for 96 ounces and start the day before chemo #1, then never stop.  Every day!  It will flush the crap out of your system quickly, it will make you less likely to end up needing IV fluids, and it will make the crappy chemo-mouth go away more quickly.  Don't forget that juicy fruits and veggies contribute to your fluids, so go for your favorites like grapes, melons, etc.  It doesn't have to be water.  Liquids are liquids, generally speaking.  Even that morning coffee helps, although you may find it tasting rather funky for a few days after treatment. 2.  There is a medical solution for every side effect except hair loss and fatigue.  Don't suffer.  To prevent nausea (because I told my MO that I was prone to motion sickness and had daily puking sessions during all my pregnancies), I had premeds that included a scopolamine patch, only 6 mg of Decadron, Emend, IV Aloxi (similar to Zofran) and an hour of IV hydration before any chemo was started.  I had lots of heartburn so I took (and am still taking) generic Prilosec and generic Pepcid.  It made all the difference in the world.  I can handle carbonated beverages in small quantities (so much for my beloved Diet Coke) and spicy foods hurt when I swallow them, so I just avoid them.  My taste buds are not quite right, but they tend to improve about a week after each treatment.  When I started with mouth sores, my MO prescribed generic Valtrex. I've always had outbreaks of cold sores when my body is stressed, and it happened after my first treatment. I've been taking this anti-viral since my second treatment and I never had a problem with any mouth sores afterwards. 3. If you need the Neulasta shot, taking Claritin the day of and for a few days afterwards really, really works for most people.  For some reason, it takes care of the bone pain.  I never had any pain during my AC treatments. I've had a little bit during Taxol (and I have needed Neulasta every time) and I have managed that pain with arthritis-strength acetaminophen for a few days. It starts about day 3 and lasts for about 3 days. 4. Regarding Decadron and the steroid impact, talk to your MO and find out if s/he is willing to try you on a low dose just the day of treatment. I am diabetic and was insistent that we reduce steroids because they have a severely negative impact on blood sugar levels, which then contributes to neuropathy. My MO really listened to my concerns and reduced my dose from the standard 20 mg to 6 mg and it worked just fine for me. Then I didn't have to deal with the steroid SEs - lack of sleep followed by a big crash. 5.  Out of 8 treatments, always on Wednesdays, I was able to go out to dinner on Friday nights each time except one, when DH was sick and I was really tired.  I am 61, so no spring chicken, and while the fatigue level builds after each treatment, I have been able to do far more things than I expected to do. We live lakefront and we had a nice hot summer. I have a big family and they were here almost every weekend. The trick was to tell them that self-sufficiency was key.  So they came, we enjoyed their company, and they did the work. 6.  I wore wigs when I wanted to go out and not get sympathetic looks, or wanted to look as normal as possible.  When I was less concerned about it, like grocery shopping or casual dining, I have worn a ball cap most of the time.  I am finding that the back of my neck gets cold in air conditioning and now that the weather is getting fall-like.  So wigs do their job to keep you warmer.  I bought a really expensive wig, and it is the most comfortable one I own.  But I don't think I would make the same decision, having been through this now.  But fit is critical.  If the cap doesn't fit your head, the wig will never be comfortable.  Someone gave me a really nice one with a style that I love; but I have a small scalp and that wig doesn't stay put and hits the wrong spot under the top of my ears.  So keep that in mind, whatever you decide.  And don't forget to order your free wrap from http://www.goodwishesscarves.org/  They offer a free headwrap to anyone who loses their hair due to a medical problem.  The choices are plentiful and beautiful.  They send you a card personally signed by all the staff.  I promise the arrival of their wrap will make your day! 7.  Do not miss the \"Look Good...Feel Better\" class. It is wonderful! Free cosmetics from leading high-end companies and instruction on how to apply them. You will learn how to tie scarves or make a headwrap from half a t-shirt. At our class, we were given a list of wig banks where we could get a free wig...not necessarily used, either. Mine was brand new.   I recommend going to the first one that comes available in your area, because they may be held just once a month.  I had hair when I went, but others had lost their hair. It didn't matter, it was extremely helpful. And it can be a way to make new friends in your area. I highly recommend you take the time to go! You will get through this! The journey will be different for each of you.  SEs will be different for each of you.  If you have any specific questions, PM me or anyone who's been there, done that. Wishing you all safe passage through the chemo maze, with minimal SEs and lots of support from your family and friends. Hugs, Michelle",

Prilosec and Pepcid are two different kinds of antacids and work on different types of acid.  So when I was taking AC, the Prilosec did the trick.   When I started Taxol, I got IV Pepcid as part of my pre-meds.  I noticed I had reflux the night I got home.  So the next day I started taking Pepcid each morning and Prilosec each night, and I have managed to be mostly reflux/heartburn-free.  Since you are already taking Prilosec, you'll probably be fine during AC.  You might want to add the Pepcid when you go start on Taxol. My pre-meds for AC were an hour of hydration, 6 mg of Decadron, Emend, and Aloxi IV.  I also used a scopolamine patch which I applied the morning of each AC treatment and kept it on for 4 or 5 days, depending on how I felt and how thirsty it was making me. The first and second days after treatment I took Emend and Claritin (because I always got a Neulasta shot on day 2). I had ativan and compazine for breakthrough nausea, which I rarely needed.",

For anyone who is debating using a port vs vein IVs for chemo, I have to say that the port is the way to go.  I cannot even imagine my chemo nurse trying to find an acceptable vein every time I had treatment.  My veins are horrible to begin with.   Yes, it's another procedure.  But if your veins blow out from chemo, you'll have problems for the rest of your life.  Valtrex is great for mouth sores.  I developed several after the first treatment, my oncologist prescribed generic Valtrex, and that totally solved the problem.  I will take it until a few months after rads. Remember to keep drinking, ladies...anything that tastes good.  At least 96 ounces of something the day before treatment and as many days after as you can tolerate.  It helps get rid of the nasty taste that much sooner.

There are different causes for heartburn.  AC stimulates one cause and Taxol stimulates a different one.  So you will need different antacids depending on what's causing your heartburn problems.  This is information that was given by my chemo nurse, when I asked for an explanation about the IV Pepcid before Taxol.  With this arrangement, I almost never needed anything else.  I think I took Tums a couple times when the combination of fried food and diet Coke just did me in.  Otherwise, I was heartburn-free.

Now that I have finished chemo, I'm facing the decision between having DIEP reconstruction before or after rads.  I want DIEP first, my RO wants rads first.  I don't believe there is any clinical evidence that indicates an advantage to having rads first.  He said he would try to find something.  I'm thinking that he's been doing this a long time; and if he needs to \"find\" something to back up his recommendation, it's probably a personal preference and not clinically necessary.  And there are plenty of reasons to have DIEP first as radiation can damage the vascular system required for DIEP to take.  I also have partially filled TEs that can cause the geometry measurements to be inconsistent.  And if they don't get the geometry correct, radiation may not provide the benefit that it should.  So knowing the specifics of my situation helps me to make an informed decision, understanding the risks and rewards of the alternatives.  During my chemo sessions, my nurse explained everything she did, every med, every pre-med, without exception, every single time. I always knew exactly what she was doing as she was doing it. And it's a good thing I was paying attention because at my first AC session, the pharmacist mixed the Cytoxan with dextrose. Normally, that wouldn't be a big deal. But I am diabetic, and a whole bag full of sugar water is not a good idea. That mistake never happened again because we were all ultra-cautious. As the saying goes, knowledge is power. There is so much in this breast cancer journey that is out of your control. Trying to be as informed as possible and making the right decisions for myself has helped me to maintain some control.  Someone asked me just today - you have so many doctors and it's all so complicated, who is the \"project manager\" for all of this.  My answer was that I am the project manager.  After all, it's my body.

He' not going to get much sympathy from me for a little ache or pain!!! By the way, some of you have talked about Diet Coke not tasting so good during treatment. I am 8 weeks PFC and it's just now starting to taste normal. Not sure what it is that makes it taste so funky, although I got to the point where anything carbonated was off limits. We don't have an RV yet. We camped in tents and popups for many years when our kids were young.  Then when we moved to the Kansas City area, we borrowed or rented RVs many times and went to lots of great places - Grand Canyon, Mt Rushmore, Badland, Zion, Bryce, etc. And when our daughter went off to college in Oregon and we were living in CT, we flew to San Francisco, rented an RV and drove up along the coast, into Oregon and Crater Lake, dropped her off then came back down through Reno and Yosemite. Can you tell I like national parks??? Our long range plan is to do RVing fulltime, as soon as DH can stop working for health insurance! Now that I've been approved for SSDI, it could happen in a couple of years.",

I know what your mom says about feeling better now that she knows.  I experienced the same thing. Once I knew what I was facing, I was able to direct my resources towards the decisions that needed to be made. And that helped me to feel \"in control\" as much as was possible.  I had a lot of sleepless nights with countless hours reading clinical studies online, reading this and other discussion boards, and wrapping my brain around the whole \"breast cancer\" concept.  Once I came to a decision, I was at peace because I \"owned\" it.  I became part of the \"team\" that traveled the path and I was, in fact, the team leader.   Gentle hugs to you and your mom, Michelle",

They thought everything looked pretty good. I had a fabulous room at the hospital, on the corner with floor to ceiling windows on two walls. And it was way at the end of the floor, so it was extremely quiet.  And my nurses came in just when I called for help.  They would check vitals and the drains and help me to the restroom, all in one visit.  So I actually got a little sleep last night.  And I took a nap when we got home.  Good luck to everyone else - you can do this.

Check it out at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  The pillow is brilliant and kept me in a comfortable position all night.  I love my recliner but my bed was way more comfy.  It's very high, though, and the little wooden stool made it easy for me to get up on the mattress, swing my legs up, and scoot into position without putting any strain on anything.  Those Danskin hoodies are so comfy - I am going to send them an email and let them know.  I have also been able to put a button-down shirt underneath the hoodie so I can walk around and feel a little less \"obvious\" that I have those bulbous drains in the pockets.  Looking almost normal is good for the soul. I am on massive doses of antibiotics to prevent infection.  It is providing me a little GI distress but nothing too alarming.  I could do without the attack at 1:30 in the morning, though...lol.  My pain is well under control.  Last night I took a half a valium, which is for the muscle spasms.  I'm really not having too many.  And the arthritis strengh tylenol along with my normal meloxicam is keeping me relatively pain-free.  I am actually pleasantly surprised that I don't really \"hurt.\"  All in all, this part is not nearly as bad as I expected it to be.  Good luck to all of you who are following in our footsteps - you'll be OK.

Dreidteacher - that had to be a scary situation!  Good thing they were watching closely.  Hopefully, they can figure a way to do the surgery without the node-mapping. hendricks1 - I looked for a short-sleeved hoodie similar to the Danskin one and couldn't find anything close.  I am going to have this problem in a couple of days as it is going to warm up here, too.  I may just wear shorts with loose pockets and let the drains go there.  I actually managed to get a loose fitting tshirt on today, so I'm feeling pretty good about dressing in a way that doesn't call attention to all the tubes and drains.  If you have a pair of loose sporty capris, that might be a good place for the drains and it would corral the tubes.  I'm 5'2\" and those tubes are so darn long!

The only supplement I took during or after chemo was a prenatal vitamin, more to help with the iron levels than to help with hair growth.  I know many of you try all these supplements and potions, some of them pricey.  I guess I'm just lucky to have good hair genes. ",

Check out the ACS \"Look Good, Feel Better\" program in your area.  There are usually sessions once a month in most cancer centers and hospitals.  When you attend, you will get a nice bag of cosmetic and skin care products, some great tips on how to NOT look sick, and maybe even an opportunity for a free wig.  I know at the class I attended they handed out certificates for a free wig along with a list of participating salons.  It was very easy!  Also, check out your insurance coverage - they may pay for all or a portion of a good wig. After I finished treatment and my hair was just starting to sprout I wore a ballcap.  I was in a store one day and this little girl shouted out for everyone to hear, \"I know why that lady is wearing a hat, she's bald!\"  Well, I laughed but I don't think her mom was too happy...LOL! My eyebrows and eyelashes all fell out by the time I had my last treatment.  But they came back quickly and I've noticed some thinning and then they rebound.  I'm 10 months PFC.  Hang in there, friends!",

Hikergal - I took the pre-natals during Taxol after my hemaglobin count was getting low.  It helped.  Talk to your doc, but I'm pretty sure they're safe.  Be sure to get one that has both folic acid and iron; otherwise, the iron isn't absorbed properly. Gemmie - yes, I'm afraid your hair loss is coming soon.  Try to think of it as a \"redo\" and you'll be OK.  And thanks, it's my nature to be optimistic; and as long as I look good and feel good, it's not so hard to maintain a positive attitude. Schatzie - your question is not too personal...the first time was a 1.7 cm lump on the left side, the second was the same breast, located near my biopsy scar(4.6 cm lesion), plus I had several axillary and intermammary nodes involved.  This time I have small mets in both lungs to accompany the mets in my supra-clavicle nodes (which had been radiated!!!), one deep axillary node, and one posterior (back) mediastinum node.  Everything is tiny and I feel perfectly fine at the moment.  Just got back from the hairstylist...the grey is gone and she trimmed and thinned a bit.  I have a lot of hair, always did for that matter.   The curly curly hair with my adorable granddaughter who likes to paddle me around the lake and...  Freshly colored with my stylist's valiant attempt at giving me a straight style.  I'll be 9 months PFC on 6/28 and this is my third \"trim\" - she thinned a lot because the sides and back were out of sync with the top. I'm wearing the sunglasses because I have a ridiculous raccoon face.  I've been out in the sun a lot - you can tell a little from the lines on my neck",

When  you get fitted, ask for pointers on where the cap should sit on your forehead.  Mine is 4 fingers above my eyebrows.  Having what looks like the \"right\" hairline is another thing that makes the wig look natural.  Good luck!

I think it's \"Excellence.\" KSMatthews - my only advice is to embrace the curl and get the back trimmed a bit so it looks like a deliberate style that is properly proportioned. I think fighting natural curl is a never-ending battle. I had a discussion tonight with my DH about my hair and he is just too funny. And he admits that any comment is likely to get him in trouble...lol. He likes the color of my hair but thinks the length is \"too young\" for me. I, on the other hand, think that 60+ ladies have no business with hair down to their shoulders unless they look like Diane Keaton! He does recognize my lack of control over the current length. And I think I'll have him tell me when it's long enough \"for my age\" so I can get it cut to keep the \"young chick\" look...hehehe!",

Best of luck with everything.  Keeping glucose levels under control will be critical to the healing process so stay vigilant!  And keep in touch! Michelle",

By the way, it's dirt cheap - $10 for a 3 month supply at WalMart - and has minimal side effects, unlike the anti-hormonals. Michelle",

There were absolutely no surprises today, for which I am truly thrilled.  The tumor was the 3 cm that everyone except the fired onco believed to be true.  The SN biopsy was clear and no nodes are involved.  The little spot that had shown up on Monday's MRI was just another hematoma from the core biopsy.  Apparently, the BS considered removing all the hematomas that I have (while I was under) but decided against it because it would have been too much.  She told me that it could take a whole year for those suckers to disappear. I have the place holders for the Mammosite radiation installed so I can't take a shower for a while.  That's a bit of a pain, but a small price to pay for 5 days of rads instead of 33.  Things are looking better each and every day. Worldwatcher - it's hard to be certain about this, but if I were 70, I am pretty sure I would not do chemo.  I'd go for the hormone therapy but have my hormones tested so that you know how much is in your system and how long you really need to take them.  And consider researching \"estrogen-reducing\" foods.  Ask you oncologist to run the AdjuvantOnline test which should give you an idea of the benefits of chemo for someone your age with your type and grade of cancer.  It takes 2 minutes to enter the data and get an answer.  I have it bookmarked and have run my own (pretending to be a medical professional) so that I really understand the benefits to be gained from chemo.  For me it's only 5% with the data we currently have available.  I'll be sending positive thoughts your way for Friday!

Enjoy your weekend at the lake, sounds absolutely delightful!  We don't have an RV yet, the plan is to sell the home in two years and go full time for a while.  I can't wait!  Take care! Michelle",

      "Content": "Sep 19, 2012 01:02PM - edited Sep 19, 2012 08:47PM by LuvRVing Thanks, Laurie!  I had been watching these threads but didn't think I'd be on the interrogated list this soon!!!  And thanks, English Major, for including me! 1.  My husband and I met in a bowling alley in Pulaski, NY, on the shores of Lake Ontario.  We had both been married before.  He didn't have any children from his first marriage but I was a package deal - I had two boys and a girl when we got married (and \"we\" had one on the way).  We moved back to my home town of Nashua, NH (he's from Long Beach, CA) and lived there until 1990.  He works for a telecom company and they relocated us to CT.  We lived in Trumbull for 4 years then they moved us again to Blue Springs, MO, near Kansas City.  All of our kids had grown up and moved back to NH/MA so the second breast cancer diagnosis was all it took to make us move back to NH.  Our son found us a little house to rent on a lake here in Salem and we love it here.  We still have our house in MO, but we lease it out and will continue to do so until the market makes selling it feasible. 2.  RVing - nope, we don't own one.  We've rented and borrowed several and we took many trips while we were living in Kansas City.  But the first and longest trip was when we were still in CT.  Our daughter decided to go to college in Oregon (yeah, 3000 miles away) so we packed up her stuff and used every available \"luggage allowance\" to get her out there, along with our younger daughter, my mom and DH.  We flew into San Francisco and picked up a CruiseAmerica motorhome, then drove up the CA coast, through the Redwoods, up to Crater Lake, then back down to Ashland, OR to her college.  From there we drove down through Nevada over to Yosemite then back up to San Francisco.  From MO, we went to Mount Rushmore, Badlands, Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion National Park, Land Between the Lakes, Carlsbad Caverns and a few other places.  When the kids were little, we didn't have a lot of money for vacations, so we bought tents and supplies and we did many a weekend in a state park campground.  Then we graduated to a pop-up and camped at many places in New England including Bar Harbor, ME.  Can you tell we love national parks?  Our \"plan\" is to retire and do full-time RVing.  But because they are so expensive, we didn't want to buy one until we were ready to jump in with both feet.  We're holding onto this dream - we want to drive through Canada to Alaska and spend several weeks in Denali National Park and whatever else is along the way.  I've never driven an RV - my DH loves, loves, loves to drive and so when we go anywhere, he is the pilot and I am the navigator!  Gas mileage - yeah, pretty sucky.  Maybe 10 mpg if you're lucky if we get a big diesel-pusher.  But we may settle for something smaller, gas-powered and might get that mileage up to 13 or so.  Breast cancer may put a crimp in our style...we'll see.  We're not ready to abandon this particular dream. 3.  What would I want people to know about triple negative BC... I think there's a misconception that it's a \"younger\" woman's diagnosis or more prevalent in African-Americans.  I've seen so many women like me - 60 or over - who are TNs that I question how accurate those assumptions might be.  And we need more research to develop treatments specific to our sub-type.  I am actually participating in a clinical trial specific to metastatic triple negative breast cancer.  I feel like a pioneer as there aren't that many trials that are specific to us.   I hope that others will consider a trial, whether it's a new drug, a vaccine, or whatever else might come along that looks promising. 4. Who would play me in a movie of my life? My daughter told me I looked like Sara Palin when I was younger, so I'll go with Tina Fey.  Besides, it needs to be someone with a great sense of humor!  And my DH said John Goodman would play him...lol!  Now, that would be quite a pair! One of my sons would be played by Michael Richards (from Seinfeld and SNL) - he used to blow things up and do all kind of crazy things that young teenagers do.  My daughter with the 3 kids would be played by Kristen Wiig - incredible sense of humor. The youngest daughter would be played by Mayim Bialik (Blossom and Big Bang Theory) - she's really smart.  And my oldest son would be played by John Stossel - he's a libertarian all the way.   Yeah, I think sometimes our family is like a Saturday Night Live skit!!!  5. Have I ever met anyone famous? Not really, just MO Senator Claire McCaskill in a restaurant in Kansas City.  And Tom Watson (the golfer) at a theater in Kansas City  I'd love to meet Ellen Degeneres or Michelle Obama. I love Ellen's show and all the wonderful things she does for people in need, adopting a school, for acknowledging and rewarding people who do amazing things.

I decided against chemo because I am also diabetic and my research indicated that diabetics do not tolerate chemo as well as non-diabetics.  I spoke with three oncologists who all wanted me to do chemo.  I asked about the diabetes factor and they all said \"diabetics do fine with chemo.\"   However, published studies in their own research publications (Journal of Clinical Oncology) indicate the opposite.  One oncologist actually suggested that MD Anderson's study of the impact of diabetes on breast cancer outcomes was \"irresponsible.\"  Seriously???  These doctors were either dishonest or uninformed within their own specialty.  I didn't need to be a statistician to understand the situation and make a decision that was right for me.  I just needed to be able to read and comprehend. I opted for a lumpectomy, Mammosite radiation and Femara.  I have a friend who has had breast cancer three times.  The first time she had lumpectomy and radiation.  Two years later she had a recurrence and had a mastectomy and AC.  That was twelve years ago.  She was trying to get me to \"throw the book at breast cancer so it wouldn't come back.\"  Then, within weeks of my diagnosis, she was diagnosed with a new cancer in her other breast and had a second mastectomy.   This time she opted for no chemo, no anti-hormones, no follow-up at all. There is no way to know if chemo will keep you safe from cancer in the future.  If an oncologist uses the word \"cure\" or \"insurance\" you should be suspicious.   Do your own research and make your own decision.  Most importantly, understand the potential side effects and decide if you can live with them, should you be the \"one\" who ends up with heart damage, permanent neuropathy, permanent hair loss, chemo brain, leukemia or whatever else could happen while you try to kill off the cells that \"may or may not\" be lurking in your body.   Looking at this side of a chemo decision is just as important as considering how you would feel if you passed on chemo and you had a recurrence.

You are in LA - perhaps you can go to one of the big cancer centers in the area. You are not being a big baby - this all sucks big time and we all freak out at the point where we are still trying to figure out the best course of treatment. Hugs, Michelle",

Cynthia gave you some good ideas on how to add protein to your diet...nuts, peanut butter, cottage cheese, no sugar Greek yogurt (add splenda and berries for a great breakfast), etc.  Will you eat fish or seafood?  Generally speaking fruit smoothies are a carbfest, not something I would do.  You'd really be better off eating the fruit and adding some protein with it (like the yogurt or cottage cheese).  One of my favorite snacks is slices of Granny Smith apples with peanut butter or a really good sharp cheddar cheese.  It's interesting that this topic would come up today.  I was interviewed this afternoon by the science editor of Diabetes Forecast who was doing a story on diabetes and cancer.  She was particularly interested in how I kept my glucose in control while doing chemo.  One thing that was a big issue for me was the Decadron.  I was well aware that steroids would cause problems.  My oncologist reduced my Decadron dose to just 6 mg on treatment day.  None before, none after.  That worked really well. But I see you have brain mets so a dose reduction may not be possible for you. I ate small, frequent meals which helped.  I actually lost about 6 pounds by the time I finished DD AC/T last fall.  And I did eat ice cream at least a couple times a week.  A kiddie size, but still - real ice cream.  And I've loosened up a lot with desserts, pasta, etc.  Life is too short to not eat cake or a yummy blueberry muffin. All that said, I would be concerned by readings in the 200's.  High glucose can affect your vision in the short term, and I wouldn't want to deal with that complication.  Because I've been diabetic for so long, I don't want to test the theory that I might not be around long enough for complications to set in.  Right now, I feel perfectly fine and I've even started to ride a bike 6 miles at a time, 3 or 4 times a week.  Everyone's situation is unique - I hope you can find a \"happy medium\" that works for you.

I did DD AC/T starting June 15th and finished on 9/28. I'm no spring chicken at 61 and I am diabetic, but I tolerated chemo a whole lot better than anyone, including myself, expected. And now, I am cancer-free! I am meeting with the head of Radiation Oncology at Dana Farber on Friday. I have a complicated radiation situation because I already had Mammosite just last year. And I have underfilled tissue expanders (in anticipation of DIEP reconstruction rather than implants).   So I will have one of the best minds in the country to help figure this out. I am living proof that there is hope and that all the crap we go through can pay off.  I have decided that 9/28/2011 will be my \"cancerversary.\"  There are lots of ideas about what date to use; for me, the day I finished chemo is the day I became cancer-free.  And that is a day to track and celebrate!

I just went through whole brain radiation for brain mets and I am now feeling so much better.  I had ten treatments which ended the Monday before Thanksgiving.  I am fortunate that I had no real side effects except for losing my hair.  And all my symptoms are gone so I am confident that the rads did their job.  Hopefully your treatment will be relatively easy and give those mets an eviction notice. Do you have ativan or a sleeping med? It will be a tremendous help as sleep is so important.  I take 15 mg of restoril and increased it to 30 mg while taking the decadron for the brain swelling.  I got six hours most nights during treatment.  Last night was the first night I slept really well and even napped in my recliner before going to bed.  There is hope, try not to give in to the despair.

And I suspect that some with diabetes feel that not enough media/marketing attention is paid to that disease by comparison.  Even though there is a diabetic \"explosion\" with estimates that by the year 2050 one third of all people will have type 2 diabetes, there is not at the moment a single research effort I could find that is addressing the effects of chemotherapy on diabetics under the age of 65.  Not one.  I asked the Komen Foundation.  Even though my BC is \"almost\" triple negative (ER is 8%, PR is 3%) and my oncotype score was 50, I passed on chemo because I feared the neuropathy and the effects of steroids on my diabetes from a long term perspective more than I feared the possibility of a recurrence.  I could find no study that reassured me that I wouldn't end up with permanent side effects from chemo with no proof that I either had a rogue cancer cell that got past the sentinel nodes or that chemo would eliminate the chance of recurrence.  And three oncologists could offer nothing because there's no research underway.  The only clinical studies were done on information from the Medicare database so all the information was for women 65 and over, and the data analyzed by MD Anderson demonstrated that diabetics do not tolerate chemo well, end up with more severe side effects that require hospitalization, and are more likely to suffer long-term neuropathy.   I am 60 so I had to pay attention to that information as it was the best available data.  I suspect the comment is nothing more than a plea for attention to another killer disease and whoever wrote the original comments was envious of the attention being given to breast cancer.   The ADA needs to hire the Komen marketeers!

If you think of it as \"everyone who gets a lumpectomy automatically must have radiation\" then yes, there is a \"standard of care\" or one-size fits all approach.  But when you dig deeper, you find out the intricacies that are specific to your own situation.  And there are some cancers that are so tiny that even radiation after lumpectomy \"may\" be over-kill.  Statistically, rads after lumpectomy lowers risk of recurrence.  But that doesn't mean that there aren't people who can safely skip it.  That's where an in-depth discussion with your RO is in order. By the way, my \"recurrence\" was in the area of my Mammotome biopsy scar, which obviously was not removed during my lumpectomy.  Gotta wonder about that.",

I hope you can come up with a combo that gives you relief.  Nausea and dizziness suck. Hugs, Michelle",
