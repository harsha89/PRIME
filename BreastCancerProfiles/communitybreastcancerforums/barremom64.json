Please check through the cold capping thread, a few BC sisters have recently received financially assistance for capping via Penguin Cold Caps. Check The Repunzel Project also, as they offer some financial assistance. I also heard Penguin has half price rates for using caps that are slightly imperfect- yet another route. As for the ice you need, many cappers have had the great success of having donations/ discounts by ice companies/ grocers once they hear what your using it for. I just completed a clinical trial for Paxman cold caps here in Nj which was 100% free! The trial is still excepting patients and is being conducted across the country as various hospitals. You may want to check that as well. Although the results aren't as good ( more hair loss) then Penguin. Cold capping is very successful with your chemo regime! Best of luck!",

I was part of a clinical trial for Paxman cold capping unit which I attribute the significant loss to. I had a significant bald spot at crown and major recession at forehead, temples and ear areas which made me look like an alien plus Overall thinning. Losing about 80% of my once thick healthy hair. I did manage to retain enough that once 5 weeks PFC came with vitually no shedding- I marched into the salon. I'm now sporting a short \"sassy\" do which is passable but certainly not the results I had hoped for. Thankful that regrowth is strong! Like you, I think about where I would be if I hadn't CC. I'd have 1 1/2\" of spotty regrwoth, but I certainly would look like a cancer patient. I actually went on a job interview last week, I am confident they had no idea what was going on. If I hadn't used CC that wouldnt have been possible. For that I'm thankful :)",

Thank you both for all your support going through my trials and tribulations! JC254- Thank you too! I WHOLEHEARTEDLY believe in cold capping. My results were poor BUT I'm proud to have been part of a clinical trial, my results will go on to better a product/process for future BC ladies, for that I'm grateful. I will always be on this board to suport anyone. It's my way of paying it forward. SueBe- Cohorts for sure! You can now start thinking of coloring and cutting your hair for sure! I used a product called \"colorance\" at my salon. No ammonia or peroxide, it last maybe 4 weeks, but after not coloring for months it felt AMAZING!!!! All the grey regrwoth you have will turn brown and fill in your thin spots like magic! Please let me know how you make out! Now lets get back to the business of LIVING!!!!! long hair, short hair, grey hair and thin hair....LIVE! ",

You've been quietly reading, I on the other hand have been chronically posting! perhaps there's a new forum for us chronic posters -a 12 step program of sorts:) I'm So glad you've gleaned so much valued advice from us! You have coverage which is great- a cut and color at some point will make you feel SO much better and clean up all those straggling pieces that dont work anymore. It took me two visits with my hairdresser to make a plan . Once I did I felt like a million bucks. you will too, your almost there. I used a \"colorance\" 5 weeks PFC, worked great!",

I'm not using Nioxin products as I've read mixed reviews. Post on the other board as well (cold capping past, present etc) Some cold capping sisters have strong preferences on \"after capping\" products. I'm still using the darn Dermorganics shampoo, although I HATE the smell. Glad shedding has lessend, I felt I could breathe just a bit easier when that happened. Best of luck:)",

She's a straight shooter and welcomes questions and knew I was seeking other opinions and was comfortable with that. I had my biopsy before I picked my surgeon. Just an FYI some surgeons will request the biopsy slides and re- do the pathology report. Sloan did that to me. I interviewed threesurgeons and four plastic surgeons. If your having a mastectomy, remember you spend a lot of time with the PS, choose wisely and make sure they communicate VERY well. Lots have huge egos and don't like questions. Don't use Dr. KUTLU out of Morristown. I've heard great things about Dr. Blackwood too. Check \"rate my doctors\" for some online reviews as well. Best of luck :)",
