I actually had a thickened endometrium in my uterus 2 years ago (found on ultrasound because of irregular cycels) and a uterine biopsy (painful!!!!) which came back normal, and now my endometrium is normal thickness. I have no clue if any of that is related to the mass by my ovary now. I don't know a lot about ductal ectasia, but I'm a vet and ultrasound things occassionally, so I might have a little idea why you are getting conflicting names/descriptions of things. Basically a cyst is a fluid-filled area, and if there are white specks in it that would be \"debris\". A simple cyst is just a round or oval, smooth-edged, black (fluid) structure. On your report at the top it says \"likely\" ductal ectasia, so that means the radiologist thinks it's consistent with that in the area that it is and it's appearance, with THEIR experience and history of reading ultrasounds. It says it was 0.5 cm X 0.1 cm so that is basically \"long\" and narrow, more consistent with a duct, than round or oval, which is more consistent with a cyst. When they briefly look at them vs. really study them with no interruptions they have more time to measure things and see more things and make conclusions, plus potentially ask another person's opinion, so that's why you might get a slightly different final report vs. why they told you right after you got it. Or when you were in the office and they said you were clear, that had only compared the right one to the old scan and not analyzed the left one yet. Hope that helps! ",

So that's basically what happened with the last one, but it wasn't as bad as ones had been in the past. I also had bloating too. I don't think I have ductal ectasia/fibrosis but I had a couple irregular mammograms (6 months apart) that were read out as ok, but I'm taking them to my breast cancer surgeon, and if he says they are ok then I'll feel better.",

Just recommended a recheck in 6 months. (that was 3 months ago.) In a way I'm not concerned but I guess I am a little... Just prior to that I had a uterine ultrasound as a follow up to one I had 2 years ago from my periods being very abnormal and sporadic (after they had returned to normal 6 months post-chemo.) There is a \"lobulated cyst-like lesion\" on or next to an ovary. Did a CAT scan and didn't get much more specific results, except it had increased blood flow and small amount of fluid around it. Recommended recheck in 3 months. That was a little over 3 months ago; my doctor's office said I would get a reminder but I didn't and I just realized it's time to schedule that. I don't know if anyone will read this or have any input. Thoughts?",

I think it's a good idea to take all the images and reports. I really think I need to bring my latest mammogram and ultrasound reports to my original surgeon and get his opinion. I need to schedule my uterine/ovary ultrasound. I will try to do that tomorrow. I guess I need to call my PCP and have them refer me to the imaging place or have them make the appointment. It aggravates me that it's not simple to figure out how to do this stuff. I don't know if my irregular cycles have anything to do with the breast issues but I don't think so UNLESS they are both related to high circulating Estrogen. (my original cancer was E/P +.) And I don't know why I have (or may have) high estrogen. I wonder if it's related to my diet. When I originally had the thickened endometrium I completely cut out soda, artificial sweeteners, and ate as organic as possible. And the problem resolved. I have a hard time eating that way now mainly due to money issues. Isn't it ridiculous that it's cheaper to eat crappier food??",

(I moved 2 days after my diagnosis in order to start a new job.) I am lucky now though that my new co-workers are very supportive and kind. I know it's hard, but please try not to dwell on numbers/percentages/and scary possibilities while waiting for results.  I am also waiting now for a genetic test and a PET scan and am going through similar stress.  I'm just trying to stay positive. I'm so sorry you lost your dad last year.  Your health issues may actually be pretty tough on your mum too, but I agree that it might be good for her (and you) if she could accompany you to some appointments.  It's always better to have two sets of ears to take everything in, and she may be able to have some of her questions answered to.

Not hearing exactly how he worded it, I don't want to read anything into it. I would not dwell on that if I were you.  The most important thing is what your biopsy says. As far as the last thing you quoted, I think what they mean by positive mammograms is that evidence of an abnormality showed up that must then be investigated via focused mammograms, ultrasounds, and possible biopsy.  That quote sounds accurate to me.  Things like cysts and fibroids show up as an abnormality, yet are benign. It's still nice if you can have somebody go with you to the appointment.  If your mum can't go, do you have a friend you can ask?  I think you'd be surprised how willing friends are to help.  You sound like a caring person and I bet you would do the same for a friend if they were in the same situation.  :)   Best of luck, please let us know how your appointment goes.",

I was so happy after seeing my doctor last week that she was believing what I was saying, and realizing it is a \"real\" problems.  I see her agin on a few weeks, as well as my onco and surgeon.   I feel like although they are highly trained, they may not necessarily know how to deal with these brain changes and issues.  (So they end up telling me to \"just give myself a break and not be so hard on myself.\")  I agree Pessa, that being alive with some memory problems beats the alternative! Yes Cowgirl that's me in my profile picture; that's 5 weeks after my last chemo treatment last summer, competing.  I was exhausted by halfway through cross-country buy my horse really helped me out.   (Well, he dragged me around at a high rate of speed and safely jumped what I pointed him at, haha!)  My riding is STILL not back to what it was because I'm STILL so out of shape and having trouble losing the weight I gained after chemo tx then a few months of hormone tx (Tamoxifen, which I had to stop because of how negatively it affected me.)  But I'm grateful to be able to ride.  Yes it would be cool to have a \"riders\" group!  Sassa---guess where I grew up... Crystal River!!!!!  How long have you lived in Homosassa?  I moved away for good in 1991 (college) and never moved back.  I miss the area sometimes, but I live on the Eastern shore of Maryland (between the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware/the Atlantic) and the area is quite similar to the Gulf coast of Florida. Thanks again ladies, it's uplifting to me to hear some support from others, and just to hear everyone's stories.  ",

I also did lots of puzzles, word and number, during chemo hoping it would help.  Don't know if it did.   The good thing is that after that visit to my doc (the day before I started this thread) I started feeling better, and am back at my class this week, and did much better on my tests. The biggest difference I noticed is that I seem to be back to learning/remembering the way I used to the last time I was in school. (10 years ago)  Which is not the \"genius\" type of learning but it's adequate or above-adequate (lol) so I'm not freaked out about not doing well in my class now.   The bad thing is that although my hormone levels are normal (for a pre-menopausal woman) she gave me a Rx for a uterine ultrasound since my cycles have been weird since they started back up last spring, and they found that my endometrium is abnormally thickened.  Not so bad that they recommend a biopsy now, but just another u/s in 3 months.  I happen to have an onco appointment on Monday so I'll see what she thinks...",

My major cognitive problems seemed to dissipate over 2 - 3 years, or I've just learned how to deal with them maybe. I do have to do some things differently than before. Write more things down. Be more methodical about some things. I used to be able to rely on my memory for A LOT and now I can't. But I'm managing. Kicks... my horse in the picture is a thoroughbred, former event horse, but now we are doing show hunters because he really doesn't like to go fast!! He has picked up the hunters really well. I have evented for about 18 years and never thought I'd do show hunters but it's fun on this horse. (Because he's good, lol! I like anything if I can do well at it!)",

When I first posted three years ago (I just re-read it) my issues were slightly different in that I was having trouble learning and test-taking. Things kind of leveled out and I wasn't noticing many problems for a bit (1 - 2 years) but this year things are really getting to me again. My memory is awful (short/medium term memory), I can't multi-task like I used to, and I basically just feel like a big ditzy airhead. It's so frustrating, I feel like my brain has aged 10 - 20 years in the past few years. I seriously feel like I'm going to be crazy by the time I'm 65. Texas357 I haven't been exercising as much as I should have and maybe that would help me a lot. I have mentioned my concerns to doctors and they just kinda blow it off, like it's normal again processes.",

I don't know much about ADD but you may be right that it is contributing to the problem. I do find the research stuff your doc told you about very interesting. I bet the hormonal issues can influence that. I get klutzy and drop things right before I get my period (although I hardly get it anymore.) So now I'm not klutzy that often I'm just a giant airhead. I was looking at your diagnoses; how did you end up getting your Dx a month apart? Did you feel lumps or did they show up on routine mammogram? Will you be having surgery at some point? Good luck with your chemo; I hope it doesn't affect you negatively!",
