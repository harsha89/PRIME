I found the genera; anesthetic affected me the worst.  I was emotional for days and had severe bloating from the general anesthetic.  I went to work 2 days later but felt like I was intoxicated. I still found working difficult the following week if I did too much walking.  My incision would start to hurt and then watery fluid would come out.  The surgeon prescribed 50 pain meds but didn't have to use any except one week later when we applied some polysporin to the incision.  The incision is very sensistive and like electrical shocks when touched.  I find it uncomfortable to sleep.  I also find I need major support.  If I put my hand over my breast and apply pressure the pain is gone.  I found even twelve days later I still had some difficulty sleeping last night due to pain.  We do not have a major centre here for breast cancer so a general surgeon removed my cluster of calcification.  He used regular sutures which I read is rarely done.  I had a drain which they say is a good thing because it prevents a hematoma from developing.",
