How do you find the best? I am lucky that I have great insurance and a family that will go to the moon for me on this.  I live in a resort town that has great sports injury Dr.'s but not too many people get BC up here.  I want the absolute best.  There has been no history of any kind of sickness in my family.  In fact, I have instantly gone to celebrity status in my family because we don't get sick.  No one get's sick.  Log in to post a reply",
