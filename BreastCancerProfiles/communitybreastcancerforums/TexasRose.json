We left three days later to go on a planned cruise. It was going to be two weeks before I could get in to see the BS anyway. I decided I could stay at home and worry or I could go on the cruise and try to enjoy myself. Admittedly, it wasn't my best cruise and I had some moments where I just went to the cabin for a bit, but most of the time I had a lot of fun and walking on beaches is very therapeutic. Looking back, I think I thought it would be my last trip ever so I hated to give it up. It wasn't. I have been on several cruises and trips since and I'm three years out and doing great- having DIEP next week. Go! Have fun! If it is BC, it will be awhile before you can get away. Enjoy it now!",

I actually had to convince my onc to let me do it that way. I am triple negative, so I wanted the most aggressive treatment I could get. It's doable. Not a picnic by any means, but I am getting through it. After AC, I will do 12 weekly Taxol and I am in the clinical trial for Avastin. I've had the Neulasta shot after each AC. My onc does it routinely with dose dense. I haven't had any SE from the Neulasta at all except some very minor bone pain. When I had that, I took the Claritan and Aleve and it cleared right up. The clinical trial nurse told me most people who have a lot of bone pain from the Neulasta shot are tall and thin with long bones. I did have some though and I am far from tall and thin. Hopefully you won't have any side effects from it.   My best advice is to chew on ice chips during AC. I did the first two treatments and had no loss of taste or metallic taste. Forgot to do it for the third treatment and yuck! Nothing has any taste at all. That doesn't help with the nausea any. Like someone else said, the further along I get with AC the more tired I am. But I can live with tired for awhile. I will be glad to see the end of the AC. Yes, you will need to listen to your body and rest when you are tired. I also started taking a Pepcid (the generic) twice a day. That helped and I try to eat small meals more often. I cannot let my stomach get empty. That is nausea trouble for me if I do. This third one has been the hardest by far, but I'm making it. It's easier than I thought and harder than I thought it would be if that makes sense. The time has gone by very quickly. I can't believe I am almost done with AC. I have a long weekend planned for the \"good\" weekend between AC and Taxol. I usually have about five good days before I have another treatment. I start feeling good Wednesday of the second week. I also feel good the Wednesday following treatment. And yes, I am extra careful during nadir. Actually, I am careful all the time now. I avoid crowds, children and sick people. I don't work, so it's easy for me to do that. I hope that helps you. If you have any more questions, I am happy to try and answer them. It's different for all of us though, so your mileage may vary.    Get some rest and drink a lot of water. Flush that junk out!!! Hugs, Mary",

I don't think she understood. She gave me an odd look. LOL  I pray she never has to find out. I didn't have any positive lymph nodes either, but way back when on the biopsy report there was a line that caused me great concern that said \"lymphovascular invasion identified\". I asked my BS about it and she glazed over it, but it has caused me some sleepless nights. Oh well, I guess soon I will have a truly complete picture and we go from there.

We weren't blessed with children although we wanted them very much and travel is my passion since I don't have kids. I told him this might be the last trip we can take for awhile, so we are going. I don't know how I will make it through, but there is no sense staying here and staring at the walls until I know more. A good walk on the beach will do wonders for me and my nurse also thought I should go. The waiting has been so difficult. At least now I have the results and can work towards a plan.",

      "Content": "TexasRose wrote: I just found this message board and have been reading some of the threads. I am 47 years old. I felt a lump with a little pain and tenderness in early February. It took a week to get in to see my PCP. She felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. It took another week to get in to have those done. After those tests were done, they scheduled me for an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. I had that on Thursday the 26th and they said it would be three to five business days before I got the results. This waiting is the hardest thing I have ever lived through.  They took five samples in the biopsy. Four of them didn't hurt at all. One hurt pretty badly and burned. The nurse told me later that was possibly because he might have nicked a blood vessel. I have had some pain and tenderness since the biopsy and I am pretty badly bruised. Other than that, I feel absolutely fine and have no other symptoms. My mom's two sisters both had breast cancer but my mom, my older sister and my grandmother never had it. I am postmenopausal. My periods ended almost two years ago. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, loving and supportive husband and family. (I have no children) But as supportive as they are, they have not been through this and don't understand the waiting and the terror. I was very happy to find this message board as all the others I found were for women who have already been diagnosed. There wasn't much for those of us playing the waiting and praying game. I know the odds are in my favor with the 80% benign rate, but that doesn't make this waiting any easier. I just wanted to say hi and offer hugs and prayers to others who are also waiting.

I am 47 years old and I have never had surgery before. I've always been very healthy. This is so surreal. And the bizarre thing is we are leaving for a cruise on Saturday. This has been booked for a long time and my husband and I have decided to go ahead and go no matter what the results. I talked about it with the nurse and she said I should go as it will take at least a week and half to two weeks to get an appointment with the surgeon. I am really hoping this is a cruise of celebration. I don't know how I will handle it if the news is bad. I do know that nature, water and sand is very healing and calming for me, so I think it will be good to be on the beach. It's just odd to be packing now. I am having such a hard time concentrating on anything. It is so hard to be so excited and so scared at the same time. I didn't realize there were games here!

It was wonderful for chemo. I used the EMLA creme to numb it and access was easy, but it was always uncomfortable. I'd like to say that after awhile the discomfort wore off, but honestly it never did for me. Mine was in a bad place- low on the inside of my right breast. One of the nurses told me once that I didn't have any fat on my chest and that is why it was so uncomfortable. It was right under the skin with nothing to cushion it. It flipped a lot and was just horribly uncomfortable. I didn't have any choice but to keep it though. I did AC and my hospital would not adminster adriamycin without a port because it is so harsh on the veins. I was glad to have it on chemo day, but I hated that thing with a passion. As soon as I finished chemo, I had it taken out. I hope that yours settles down for you and the discomfort passes. As much as I hated it, I wouldn't have gone through chemo without it. It was a very love/hate relationship!",

I have no children, so I had never given birth either. I was so scared of the pain, but it has been very manageable. You can do this! What helps me the most is to take it one thing at a time. I concentrated on the surgery since that was first for me. I didn't give the chemo another thought. After the surgery, I spent the first two weeks healing. Now that it has been almost three weeks since the surgery, I am starting to think about chemo and preparing myself for that. I had a teacher once who would ask us, \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.\" This is overwhelming and if you let yourself take it all in at once, it's too much. Just take one thing at a time. Your mind is going to go to dark places. That is normal. I believe very much in positive thinking though. When my mind slips into dark places, I do some deep breathing and positive thinking to get myself back on track. Or I come here and read the inspiring stories section. Or I pray. Whatever it takes to get me back to where I need to be to fight this. And I totally agree with Deb about the Xanax. I didn't want to take it. I fought that pretty hard until my breast surgeon pointed out to me that I was making myself anxious about taking anti-anxiety meds. We laughed. I realized she was right and I started taking the pills. I haven't had one since my surgery because I don't need them right now, but I couldn't have gotten through those dark days before the surgery without them. They were a lifeline. Take them. Just having the surgery and knowing the full picture will help so much to take some of the pressure off. I wish you well. You are in my prayers. (((hugs))) Mary  ",
