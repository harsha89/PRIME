The area they are treating is big, extending from above the collar bone down below where the breast was and across to my back. This is meant to be preventative as all my lymph nodes under the are were taken out. My oncologist had told me that I shouldn't need 6 monthly scans unless there's a problem, I think because my cancer was lobular and hard to spot on scans. I don't know if I need to have any scans immediately after the radiotherapy. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "mandm43 wrote: My lobular cancer was not picked up by mammogram or ultrasound in 2012, only 18 months later in Sept 2013, where it had grown quite large and multi-focal. As I had very dense breasts and had had cysts in the past I assumed that it was fibrocystic. Even the surgeon said the lumpiness felt like glandular tissue! I am in the process of undergoing radiotherapy, after surgery and chemo were completed. My oncologist said that the chemo / radiotherapy treatments are precautionary and referred to my cancer as \"the cancer you had\" which I am happy about. Also highly estrogen positive so I have started taking tamoxifen. I was excited to find this forum and it's uplifting to hear that so many people survive stage 3 for a long time Log in to post a reply",
