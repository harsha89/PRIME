I work in the hospital where I had all my treatments and I actually work with my surgeon.  I figure after two ultrasounds, two biopsies, a mammogram, an MRI, two surgeries and not to mention God knows how many doctors/medical professionals poking around my chest, that half the entire hospital has probably seen me topless by now.  And you know what?  I just don't care anymore!  Now if it was a cancer I had to take my pants off for, it would probably be a different story.  LOL!  Just take it one day at a time and try not to worry too much - easier said than done, I know.  Hopefully your ultrasound will be the only test you need and you will get a clean bill of health with just a simple cyst.  Good luck!  I'll be thinking about you and wishing you well!",
