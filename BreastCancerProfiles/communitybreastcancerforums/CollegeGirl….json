Kept having the daily exercise and dancing, not as intense as before of course, so maybe that's also what helped me go through it quite well.",

I'm a Russian, born and living in Russia, and my experience here, as well as that of MANY people is that rads came first, and then did chemo. Of course, treatment plans are different depending on many factors, and some people have rads before/before and after surgery etc, but for a great number of us here rads came after surgery and before chemo. Just interesting to see the difference in treatments.",

There really are hundreds and hundreds of very supportive women here who do know a lot and who are wise to find the right words to say just when you're not quite yourself or need to vent, or youre upset and not sure what to do. I would really like to offer some support here, too, and I know it sounds like a really difficult thing to do, but please try not to worry too much, and instead make an appointment to get a second opinion and have it checked. Most likely it is nothing to worry about it, and you will get your good night's sleep back again soon. If there is something going on there - you will have caught it early, and with all the knowledge, experience, technology and meds doctors are so much better prepared to help you fight this than they were even a few years ago. My thinking is, if there's something that bugs you about your body - keep getting as many opinions as you need until the problem is addressed. Take care of yourself, and let us know how you're doing, ok? big hugs.",
