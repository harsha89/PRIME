I had a mastectomy and 14 lymph nodes removed (3 being positive) on May 4 with reconstruction done on the right breast my plastic surgeon suggested I do both but my general surgeon and oncologist were both OK with my decision to do the one. Why mess w/ a perfectly healthy left breast. Anyway this has been an experience and at times hell but hey gotta beat this with  positive thoughts. I have cried allot and been scared and still scared but I have good support from my partner, family and friends. I will also start physical therapy Tomorrow due to the tightening in my stomach from surgery (belly fat used for reconstruction) and they plan to do ultrasound on my breast to loosen everything up looking forward to that. Anyway chemo starts Thursday, going to do TC every 3 weeks for 6 treatments I'm anxious to get started but scared of what I'm going to feel like especially since I just started feeling better. Anyway best of luck to all of us going through this and it's just nice to be able to vent and to have people offer advice. Thanks all  ",

I am presently going through personal issues with my partner of 12yrs so that hasn't made me feel any better but I must say overall the chemo is OK it's the emotional heart break of possibly losing my partner that is the worse. Best of luck to all My next tx is July 2",
