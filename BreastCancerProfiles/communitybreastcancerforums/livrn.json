Last thursday when I took my bra off my husband said that it looked like I had a welt over the left nipple. This went away within 2 hours. My husband believes that the pain I am having is coming from this bra being too small. However it is only on the left nipple and the pain still persists today and I have not wore that bra since last Thursday. So, I guess I am wondering if wearing an ill fitted bra for 5 weeks can cause persistant pain even the situation is remedied. My husband also thinks that this is happening on the left side only because that breast is a little bit larger. I don't know. Any ideas?",

Doc asked about breast cancer family hx. Positive for 2 post menopausal- maternal grandmother and paternal great-aunt. Doctor scheduled a mammogram with ultrasound if needed on 10/28/2013. I am also seeing a plastic surgeon in December for a breast reduction consult so I know I need to have a mammogram anyway before having a breast reduction.",
