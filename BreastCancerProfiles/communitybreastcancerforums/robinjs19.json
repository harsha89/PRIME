I have 4 or more tumors in my right breast (3 were biopsied).  All three are IDC (I think that's the right acronym -- invasive ductal).    All tests show that the left breast is fine. I have extremely dense breasts and these tumors were very hard to find.   I had a clear mammo and ultrasound last June.  If I hadn't found a lump, I don't believe the screening would have. My doctor is encouraging a bilateral.  I'm also waiting for the results of the Brach (sp?) test... if that's positive then this is a no brainer.  (I am Ashkenazi, and my mother also had breast cancer.) But, if it's negative.   ?  Should I still have the bilateral?    All thoughts are most, most welcome.   thank you!

The most compelling reason to go ahead with the bil is the dense breast issue and the need for  MRIs to be sure nothings happening in there. I'm not a worrier, so peace of mind just isn't a big issue for me -- but my family is another story.  My husband, daughters, parents, siblings all really want me to have the bil and never have to worry about it.  I keep thinking that the decision to remove the breast is irreversible.   The decision to keep it can be changed at any time.   Of course that means going through surgery and recovery again. I have over 2 weeks to get to think about this and get completely comfortable with my decision.  Thanks again for all the support Robin ",

I look forward to being on the other side and helping others...",
