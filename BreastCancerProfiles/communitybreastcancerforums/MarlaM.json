My pathology showed that there is still a good amount of cancer cells left behind. It was almost like getting the cancer diagnosis all over again. I'm so sad and scared. My oncologist is ordering new CAT and bone scans, and I'll be starting chemo again soon. My hair is just starting to grow back just as thick as it was before, but now I'll be losing it again, not to mention the new worry about the other side effects of another round of chemo. I'm so sorry that we are going through this, but we'll get through it.",

I had chemo before surgery in hopes that they wouldn't have to remove the nodes, but no luck there. One of my nipples was a little bit gray, so my surgeon ordered hyperbaric treatments, which really seem to have helped. They didn't give me any bras, so I've been going braless. I still have a lot of swelling, and terrible tightness across my chest. Feels like a big rubber band being pulled tighter and tighter. So uncomfortable. It sounds like I need one of those breathing thingeess recommended earlier. Thank you all for being here. If we have to go through something like this, it's nice to have someone who is going through it too.",

He told me if I didn't do any additional treatment, chances of recurrence is 50%. I was so shocked, I didn't ask what the chances were if I just did rads and hormone therapy. I'm wondering if a second opinion at this point might be worth it.",
