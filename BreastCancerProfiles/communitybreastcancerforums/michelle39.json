    "Content": "michelle39 wrote: I was just diagnosed with focal atypical ductal hyperplasia two days ago.  The hardest part (I think) was the waiting.  I had my first mammogram on March 2nd, then the second one on March 12th.  They didn't do the biopsy until April 15th then it took 3 weeks for them to come up with a diagnosis.  They tell me I am high risk but they are not going to remove it at this time they are just going to watch it and also want me to think about the Tamoxifen.  On the same day that I had my biopsy, my aunt had one also and was diagnosed with breast cancer and she had a partial mastectomy and now might have to undergo radiation treatments and take Tamoxifen.  There are 5 people on my mothers side of the family who has breast cancer.  I just wished they would go ahead and take it out if I am such high risk.
