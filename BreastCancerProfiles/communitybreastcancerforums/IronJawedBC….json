Because of the IBC, I think I would really question using a local facility to treat your cancer.In regards to your diagnosis, I think I would be considering filing for short term disability so that you can put all of your energy into fighting this disease. I have friends that have had things light up on scans, only to have the PET scan and get the alls clear.  It is very stressful for you, I know and I am sorry you are having to go through this.  Degenerative disease is normally from day to day stress on your body, old injuries etc. and may very well not have anything to do with cancer.  Do you have a cancer resource center nearby?  Many times they are great about helping you understand test results.  John Hopkins also has a great \"ask the expert\" service.  I used them several times in my early stage of diagnosis and they were extremely helpful. I genuinely hope that your PET scan proves these areas to be from old injuries and calcifications.",

Dimpled skin can be an indicator of invasive bc.  The fact that it is not orange peel is a good thing, many inflammatory breast cancers show up first with orange peel skin as a symptom. Tubule formation is part of the equation they use in establishing grade, it is the percent of carcinoma composed of tubular structure.  Less than ten is normally graded as 3. Mitosis is how fast the cells are dividing.  Hers are dividing slowly, which is good, score 1. Nottingham score is a modification of the Schaff Bloom Richardson score and is based on tumor size, grade and # of lymph nodes involved.  Hers would be considered an intermediate grade cancer.  Mine was grade III, or high grade.  The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer cell. Her cancer is hormone positive, which means that they will probably recommend tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, like Arimidex, so that the hormones in her body do not feed the cancer cells. She does not have an overexpression of the Her2 gene,(causes excessive growth), which is good, so she will not need Herceptin. T1 means that her tumor size is less than 2cm. I am not a doctor so this is definitely the condensed version.  This site has a good section on understanding pathology and the ACS has a good guide which includes a decision tree for treatment guidelines for breast cancer patients.

For the fibromyalgia ladies, do you have severe foot pain?  My PC started treating me as if I had fibro the year after I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was having all kinds of pain issues and was not sleeping because of the pressure points. He prescribed me a muscle relaxer before bed and a strong anti inflammatory for morning.  I had also developed plantar faciitis (sp) as I had taken a retail job.  My onc was irritated, said that fibromyalgia is what doctors say when they have no answers.  Once my sleep pattern re-established I felt a lot better and gradually got my quality of life back. I too have major insurance/financial issues and have gone off of every med my doctors have recommended except for my tamoxifen. I take care of my Dad who has advanced colon cancer, s that is a major stressor. In the last several months my pain has elevated, but particularly in my feet.  I look like I am 90 years old.  I am just wondering if this is another fibromyalgia related pain or something else like the 20 lbs I've gained since being diagnosed.  Just another day in bc paradise.  Grateful for each day, but sure would like to be able to move freely again.  I will also say that if you do get diagnosed with fibromyalgia, be aware that the auto immune diseases can cluster; once you get one, others may follow.  I had really nice skin before bc.  I now have psoriasis on several areas, again auto immune related.  Several of my friends on Komen have Rheumatoid Arthritis now. Helen, I truly hope you don't officially join the breast cancer survivor sisterhood and that they find benign reasons for all of your pain and the breast issues. While I worry about the itching and pain, maybe it is something as simple as the bra you wear, I had one that broke me out.  If you do not get answers on the breast issues, keep pushing for answers. Blessings to all.",

Some did not get the PET scan until after their surgeries and nodes have been checked. The PET scans, although thorough, are expensive and I think the insurance companies try to reserve them for those who already have a diagnosis and are checking for spread.  It is recommended by ACS and most breast cancer advocacy groups that a bilateral MRI be performed in addition to the mammogram in the diagnostic phase, which is probably what the one woman was referring to when she said \"imaging\".  Keep pushing for answers, and at this stage I am amazed they have not proceeded to a biopsy so that you are not just dealing with speculation.  All the diagnostic tests in the world will not confirm without a doubt that you have or do not have breast cancer.  You need a biopsy.You continue to be in my prayers.  Take care of yourself.  Take a relaxing soak in the tub, get a massage, surround yourself with humor.  Patience is not a virtue I had when I was diagnosed, but it comes in handy when you are navigating the system.Good luck.",

Someone else posted a question about breast MRI not all that long ago, and a MRI expert radiologist posted a response that confirmed my belief that it is definitely worth the extra effort to get to a independent breast MRI facility.  If I can find the post I will post back here so that you can read it also.

Not on par with MD Anderson maybe, but Vanderbilt is pretty well respected. The difference for me is that a hospital provided service (even mammograms) gets billed by my insurance as part of my deductible, so that unless I have met 100% of my $5000 deductible, they do not pay.  My point is that like in your case, it is well worth while to find a facility that you can trust.  I too noticed a big difference in the machines and in the ability of the staff.  The nurses at my local hospital have never been able to get the IV for the contrast in my arm, they blow the veins and end up in a tiny vein in my wrist.  I told the nurse in Nashville to not waste her time, and she laughed and said \"Let me give this one try, I do it every day\" and sure enough first try, no bruising, no problem.  I genuinely am in love with the women at that facility.  Bonus was absolutely no pain for the biopsy, my stereotactic at the local hospital was a lesson in ancient torture.  Every woman here needs to be their own best advocate and take the time to find the best solutions for themselves.  Blurry diagnostics should not be acceptable at any time, and I really wonder how many of us are aware of image quality.  The discs from the Nashville facility I can put in my own computer and see for myself how clear they are.  The discs from the local facilty have a security incription so that only a medical programmed computer can view them.  I think that should have been my first clue.",

Hopefully, your symptoms are due to a benign condition, but you definitely need to push for some answers.  As young as you are, a MRI would be more beneficial than a mammogram, but just don't let them pat you on your head and tell you you are too young to worry about it.  Is there a rash where you itch?  Any swelling?  Sometimes a skin punch biopsy should be performed on the itchy area. You will be in my thoughts and prayers for benign results.",

You want knowledge to make informed decisions, you don't need sensational articles to scare you to death. What part of Oklahoma are you living in?  I have a friend from Komen that is a couple year survivor, done all her surgeries and chemo, and is now starting a non-profit that lives near Oklahoma City, I believe.  If you want, send me a Private message and I will put you in contact with her.  It really does help to have support from women who have gone through it.  American Cancer Society has the Reach for Recovery program where they assign you a peer counselor who would be an ear and a shoulder. Cancer is a very scary thing, but keep in mind that the majority of us survive it.  It is not a death sentence like it used to be.  Your mom dying of ovarian cancer was a terrible thing to go through, but it is a different cancer and has not had all the advances that breast cancer has had.  It generally does not get detected until a much later stage because it \"whispers\".  Hopefully this is benign, but if not, because you have been getting mammograms you have every reason to believe it has been caught early.  God bless you and I will pray for benign results.  Give your pups a hug and enjoy some canine therapy.  If you are completely stressed out, there is nothing wrong with taking the valium or another anti-anxiety med to get through.",

If you are really not comfortable, you could always send your films and discs to another breast specialist for a second opinion.  I know that the implants make screening a challenge.  God bless you and I genuinely hope you never have to join our club of breast cancer survivors.",

You have done the best to inform yourself and can only make the decision for yourself based on your criteria.  Those of us who have chosen lumpectomies have done so at the advice of our cancer teams based on years of studies that have proven that the survival rate for early stage cancers with lumpectomy and radiation, and mastectomy are exactly the same. Many studies have also proven that the quality of life for women with lumpectomies is superior to that of those with mastectomies, which is part of the reason lumpectomies became an option after years of automatic mastectomies with a cancer diagnosis.  Five years after my diagnosis, I am far too aware, and am friends with women who chose to have bilateral mastectomies, only to have the cancer come back as a local or distant recurrence.  It sucks, but there are no guarantees.  We inform ourselves, and make the best decision we can, for ourselves. We choose different paths with the same hope that we reach the other side of treatment with a lifelong relationship with NED, No Evidence of Disease. I wish you a swift recovery and hope you too find that \"wizard\" who creates magic with your reconstruction. God bless you and your son and keep you safe.",
