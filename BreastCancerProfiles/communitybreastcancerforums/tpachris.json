In March of this year my gyn felt the lump had grown so I had a mammo and u/s. The lump is painful part during part of my cycle. The mammo found calcifications that required a needle biopsy. I received the results of that this week. I was dx with PASH. I need to f/u with BS to determine if it should be removed.   I am currently on Mirena and was on the pill for 6 years in the past.  I would like to know what the scar is like from anyone that has had it removed. TY",
