    "Content": "JTV wrote: I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer in October of 2009.  Clear mammogram just 6 months prior.  Have been good about mammograms since age of 38 (I'm now 44) and my annual gyno visits.  Cancer was very aggressive (Grade 3, HerTu positive, ERPR weakly positive, tumor 6.7cm).  I responded very well to my chemo.  Tumor is gone. Docs say I am in a form of remission.  MRI may show some \"uptake\" microscopic disease left.  I am a candidate for surgery but there is no scientific evidence that surgery with Stage IV prolongs your life or keeps  the disease in remission.  My Mayo onc. feels the Herceptin that I will be on for the rest of my life will control the disease (hopefully).  My local onc feels that I should have a mastectomy.  Ugh!  Any of you out there who have/have not had surgery and have an opinion or experience with similar situation?
