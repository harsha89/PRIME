Unfortunately nipple cannot be spared on left due to location of the DCIS and on right prophylactic tbd - it is scarred from a prior biopsy so debating with the PS on whether it should be saved as I'm also pretty large (G) so I expect to go down some when I finally get implants, which means the nipple would need to move anyway. At this point I'd just like to get to it and get on with recovery, the down time will be hard to manage as I'm used to being busy and a lot of work travel too. This site & all the great people help answer all the questions I keep coming up with while I wait for the day to come.",

It definitely gets v real v fast! I am also doing nerve block as borogirl is - highly recommended by both surgeons and no change to anesthesia plan, but rather a longer term pain management benefit for post-op that they find helps a lot. I hope they are right! I do nuclear prep on Tues for the sentinel node biopsy and that's the last of the pre-op. I continue to do a lot of pre-op pectoral and psoas stretches that I was told will help a bit at least with all those muscles will go through w TE's & eventual implants. I would say the information and color given on what to expect have been really good from my medical team, plus all I've learned from this community, but the anticipation is still very hard, especially of the pain, the drains, and the immobility / dependence for awhile. Also of whether the TE's will be as uncomfortable as some say they are. The rules have been emphasized a lot for the best outcome, and quickest recovery, so I'm planning to be as compliant as possible (not a normal trait for me!). I think I carry 5 lbs every time I pick up my purse (time for an edit pre-op - a good weekend project & picking a tiny purse to force the point for the next few weeks whenever I finally am mobile again) and as for hair, no arms above head for 2 weeks should yield an interesting look - working on getting help with that. My PS is a no-shower believer while the drains are in, so that's 2 weeks also of less than optimal cleanliness - I like my showers and baths! Oh well. These pragmatic issues help distract from the concerns over them finding any surprises in the nodes, the realization this is actually happening now, and the nervousness over the way this all ends up aesthetically too. We all have a lot on our shoulders! Wishing everyone the best as this November group deals with the reality together.",

Same for me with some good & some tougher news. Good news was healing well & all fine there but pathology not totally as expected - lymph nodes clean (SNB done) but invasive found not just DCIS, so I'll likely be going on Tamoxifen once the oncotype and the full pathology is back. The surgeon and everyone seem a lot more surprised than I am - I guess I always figure they won't know til they know, which is why I was ready to do the BMX without debate. Now with the findings of more areas & more serious invasive type findings, even after 3 biopsies and multiple mammos, MRIs, ultrasounds etc, just shows the limits of the tools until the surgery is actually done and pathology is back. But knowing is always better than not I guess. BluGene - I would second the recliner vote especially if you are a side sleeper, it's the only way to stay situated in place and I'm at 9 days post op. coclico - I'd also second the vote on extending the time to start a new job - 19 days will not be long enough even going back to a job you know well much less to start something new. Give yourself a chance and delay the start. The recommended time off work after BMX is 6 week as said in another post - once you are in it, you can see why it's true. Pain, discomfort, drains, follow up appts, pathology etc. - lots to deal with after surgery that won't be resolved in that short a time. Wish you the best with upcoming surgery.",

Had bmx and sentinel node biopsy with te\u2019s placed sub pec late yesterday - last surgery of the day which ended up ok because I didn\u2019t have to rush too early and got to take a last leisurely shower and do my hair (best it has ever come out by the way - just so I could go destroy it in a surgical cap! Typical Murphy\u2019s law...). I did the pec nerve blocks and the other nerve block in the back (not epidural / I don't know the name). PS was able to fill 230cc\u2019s. As a former natural 32G it looks like my 12 year old size but know a long road ahead on that front. I feel \u201cok\u201d if I am just still and arms close to sides. But no one will let you stay that way for long! Moving arms around is not fun but necessary once in awhile (and typing not fun either so I\u2019m stopping in a sec!) and have done my first lap around the ward. Had nausea during the night during intermittent sleep but called and nurse gave meds for that right away so it got better. Time to lay very still again and just doze fm meds & manage my remote!",

They are saying Thurs and I'm really looking forward to having it removed. When they took out #3 yesterday they also did a 60cc fill, saying it might help close the pocket a bit so this last of the 4 finally quits being over 30cc's a day. Fingers crossed. In the meantime my surgical pathology keeps yielding negative surprises. First they were all surprised to find IDC instead of just the DCIS 3 biopsies suggested. But even with IDC, with it ER/PR+ all that meant was going on Tamoxifen vs not needing anything, and all thought we just wait for the Oncotype and they all expected it to be low. So I had adjusted to all of that and did my reading and adapting to the idea of Tamoxifen & AI's for the next 10 years, only to get told today the next surprise. HER2 came back positive. ðŸ˜” Now chemo in my future. Taxol 12 weeks /Herceptin 1 year. I can get fills but no exchange til Taxol is done and I can't start til Jan / they wait for recovery from the surgery. In the meantime all the scary stuff of chemo to research, and the hair loss etc. to contemplate. Not having a good night after thinking it was starting to get manageable again. Time to learn even more about the state of things in the chemo world, and stuff like cold caps etc. Plus think about what it means for work after expecting I'd be back in the 6 weeks and so on. Now I just don't know how I'll feel - physically or mentally - and I guess I'll be seeing if working from home for an extended period can work at all as right now I can't imagine being in an office and doing constant work travel through all of this. I can't imagine doing much but hiding at home right now. Argh!!!  ",

I would say putting my legs up onto the ottoman or getting up from a chair or a bed even propped up (always trying to do both or any other move of upper body with 100% abs not pushing off or lifting myself w my arms) maybe is pulling on that spot? Other than that though random stabs at times esp where the drains are (2/side 4 total) and esp the sentinel node biopsy side. It has been important to keep up with the pain meds and though I'm trying to take less, being too fast to come off was a big mistake I paid for by not sleeping one night after thinking I felt pretty good - we are all only a few days out from major surgery and there seems to be this badge of honor on how fast one gets off pain meds - I'm working on it but it's not a race! And using pain meds as prescribed 3 days post major surgery is not an addiction! Weaning to weaker meds or less often (tylenol xs vs oxy etc, the longer lasting muscle relaxer etc) are all on the right glide path so I'm trying to slow down my eagerness to \"be better\". We all are where we are on the path and not much to be done for some things but take the time they need. No marathons possible w these drains hanging off me anyway! I do find now a few days post op I \"feel\" more generally. As in more distinct feelings of the individual muscles or areas of stress, vs general pain & aches, more of a feeling of where the TE's are under the muscle and weird twinges and twitches from that all settling in, and the start of some itching or discomfort around certain spots. The post-op bra I have to wear with gauze pads 24/7 hits at just the wrong spot where the drains are, but it's on the sentinel node side that it causes the most discomfort scaling up to actual pain. There are 5 exercises I do 5x a day and they are kind of all hitting various hot spots at different times. I can also feel the suction from the drains at times which is somewhat uncomfortable too but overall, slow and steady progress. It seems like it's all about taking your time...",
