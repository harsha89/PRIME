Seems like every day I am experiencing new aches and twitches which are causing fears of metastatic status. All of a sudden, symptoms I was having a couple months back are bringing new fears that they are related to the spread of the cancer. This wait is horrendus but what if the results are worse! I even worry that my negativity will impact on my prognosis. Unfortunately, my family is very far but truth is, other than my in laws, no one else has really reached out except for a sympathetic email. I don't have many friends either. The last group of friends ( 5 sisters and their family) became estranged about 2 years back when the friendship became toxic, filled with jealousy and I had to remove myself from the situation. I figured if they knew about my bc they would actually be happy something bad finally happened to me. Sad. My one good friend retired to Austin last year. I feel so alone and if it has not been for the support I have received here I probably would be gone by now. So, a very sincere thank you to all of you for giving me a lifeline.  I had spent the last 2 of 3 days in bed and reading everything on this forum. The survival stories have given me so much hope ( by the way, I will post my mil story in the 10 year thread and hope others will get some positivity from it) she has been a big help. How do you let go and have faith? Sob.I am so scared and I hate how my DH and daughter is having to deal with it as well.

I think she is doing a better job than the dh ( shh, no one says a word). Believe it or not, she is aspiring to be an oncologist( decided on this 8 months ago, kind of ironic), and so I hope this journey will give her valuable insight from the patient's point of view.

I had a bilat with no recon, am 49, have a 16 year old daughter, and know ( even though I can be vain, please forgive me for my shortcomings) that my self image have very little attachment to my breasts. I also have a very secure marriage and had grew up with parents/ and in a society that valued 'brains over matter'. Yet, I will admit, I have always loved dressing up, am a avid runner, keep very active, and ate well. But, for some strange reason, breasts didn't mean much to how I perceive myself ( besides have you look through Anthropologie catalogs, I swear most of their models have no breasts!). Also, I had always had painful pre-menstral breasts that hindered my runs and would be happy not to have to deal with that anymore. I tend to be practical and my priorities are to be with my family for as long as I possibly can. Thus, I will do anything to ensure optimal survival. When I first saw myself after the surgery, I didn't have any feelings one way or another. My anxiety was focused on getting my pathology report and praying it would be a good one. Pain, I had little, but this varies. Discomfort for me was mainly tightness under my arms. Now, that I am feeling a little better ( thanks to the support and comfort of members on this board) I am looking through these Anthropologie catalogs and thinking ' hey, I might actually fit their clothes better!'. Hopefully, I will always continue to find a silver lining in every thing. I think you have to be really honest with yourself and your feelings. Unfortunately, a mastectomy is not an easy surgery and the pain and/or discomfort, coupled with a bc dx, can be overwhelming. The journey is neither a pleasant or easy one and we will face a new normal. What and how we make of it depend greatly on our determination, the support we receive, our drs, and XANAX. Keep strong, pray, cry when you need, and laugh at every opportunity. ",

I just wanted to throw the kitchen sink at it and know that I had done everything possible to prevent spread. That being said, it didn't mean that I was fearless. I must had cried my eyes out and had convinced myself that I would never survive chemo, surgery and any and all treatments. I had just finished my last infusion a week ago and am glad that I decided to do it. I had few SEs and even managed to travel for a college visit with my daughter AND sell and moved house during that time. Truth is, with every treatment ( surgery, chemo, and now hormonals), I had always assumed the worse. So far, thank God and my medical team, none of my dreaded thoughts have happened. Ultimately, that decision is yours and yours to make. Just remember not to look back, no regrets. Best of luck to you.",

I don't believe I slept for the first week BUT it does get better. It is good that there is no lymph node involvement so far, so your scans will probably be fine. Once you have a treatment plan in place, you will feel more in control. Also, please don't let any treatment scare you. I was so fearful of EVERYTHING. I had undergone a bmx and am now waiting for my final chemo infusion. It has all been super manageable. Make sure you gather a medical team that you will be confident with, that way you will be comfortable leaving your care in their hands. They will be there to guide your treatment plan and lay your fears to rest ( just one less worry on your shoulder). Also, surround yourself with friends and family that are going to be supportive and can help cheer you up during those dark moments. Members on this forum has been invaluable to my mental well being, some have even managed to make me laugh on my darkest days. Best of luck to you , our prayers and thoughts will be with you.",

It started because I decided to wean myself off xanax and then, I think all the anxiety took over. I finally resolved to just accepting my plight and slept whenever my body would allow me to. It did get better but I am resigned to the fact that my treatments are still a long way out and I have still to deal with so much anxiety.  On the bright side, my physical self has been steadily improving since, and it isn't a concern I have at this time. I am SHORT ( @ 5'), so you think that I should be an expert about reaching for things by now.  I did go see a PT and that has helped tremendously with cording  and range of motion. I even started doing walks and short runs since. I think our mental health is more challenging. All the worrying makes us even more tired. We think we will sprint right back into the race. I am beginning to realize the reality of our situation. I try to tell myself that everyone of us heals differently and we just can only do what we can.  One day, one step, one breath at a time.

My hip pain started in early January before I started chemo. My concern is whether the pet/ct would still be valid since it was taken in early December? Could mets have shown up since?",

I really dreaded the side effects and have read horror stories on google. I also suffer from frequent migraines and was worried that I will not be able to withstand treatment. My final infusion is this coming Friday, so far had had 3. I made sure that my MO is aware of all my concerns before starting. Well, none of my fears came to fruition. I even started back running because I felt little to no fatigue. I had only one half day headache and one day of stomach bloat ( from the steroids, I think) after the first infusion. My MO resolved the issues once I told her of my problems. I had only minor problems since. Oh, and I managed to gain 5 very stubborn lbs on chemo, I am so mad, but given the circumstance, I am grateful. Just hoping that chemo is actually working. They have many drugs to combat SEs nowadays. Besides, you may not even need chemo but if you do, just know that it is manageable.",

My headaches are sporadic mostly when I am stress or if I didn't get enough sleep. However, when it acts up, it feels like it is caused by the pulling and pain from my neck. My collarbone aches sometimes as well. The thought of bone mets has crossed my mind but I was dealing with so many other scares that I have not addressed this issue in depth.I had the pains since bmx but it has not gotten worse. I mentioned it to MO a few months ago and she thinks it is due to posture changes resulting from bmx. I am also on aromasin and I wonder if it is not somewhat related as well. Have you mentioned it to MO?",

Surgery and chemo lasted for 5 months ( with about a month in between each treatment, great breathing room). I started hormonals after chemo and hope to be on that for 10 or more years if it means keeping this darn thing at bay. Is life normal? Yes, very much so and, in fact, I have learnt a much greater appreciation for it. I started work full time 6 weeks after chemo. I have even put in some long weeks without any trouble. I used to run 45-50 miles a week before bc and have slowed down a little, not because of bc ( altho I suspect I use it as an excuse at times!) but I gave myself a break through treatment. Now, it is just training to get back on pace. Chemo was not bad for me at all. I didn't have nausea ( nor did I take meds for it). My blood counts were great. A few aches, nothing worse than a hard workout. I did lose some hair but not all. It is back fuller than before.I never really felt much fatigue and had actually moved house twice. I, also, made college visits with my daughter during chemo. What is realistic lifespan? I don't know and all I have is faith and hope. I am fearful and there are days that I do better than others. But I am grateful for each day and the small things that I have never appreciated before bc. Chemo actually put me in chemopause and eliminated my debilitating weekly migraines and my skin has never looked better. I don't get mad at the trivial things anymore and I truly feel so much happier. I hope you will find peace as you move along this journey. We are resourceful women/men and we will find a way to thrive despite our circumstance. Here's wishing you all the best.  ",

I got through by the help of Xanax but now I don't even take one anymore. It is still fearful but the desperateness and intense anxiety will dissipate somewhat. One of the best advice that I was given, through this forum, is to make sure you bring something to record your visit with your drs. That way you can retain information. Please come on this forum when you need help, everyone is totally understanding.",
