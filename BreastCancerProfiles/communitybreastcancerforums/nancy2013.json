I'm 44 and have stage 1 on right side and did lumpectomy in August, but the margins were not clear mainly because the dr treated it as regular lump removing biopsy, no LN removed. I also have adh bordering with dcis on the left side. negative on brca test (the result was come out in just one and half weeks from the day drawing the blood) and no family history. I did IVF before. I guess that might contributed something on BC. I also know someone who did ivf and got bc. but the Drs said there's no direct relationship. I hope all of us the best luck.",
