Jayne:  I didn't think about being bald and excessive facial hair, either.  That brought a laugh!  My hair is actually back in, maybe 1/2 inch all over.  One of the most awesome feelings I have ever had is feeling the wind blow my hair.  I never thought about before it happened about a month ago.  It was wonderful!  It was like God was telling me to be joyful in the little things.  If I could have jumped, I would have.  It was such a wonderful feeling.   Donnid:  Do you mean shaving your face?  Hopefully, this will go away like they say some of the other symptoms will.  I love it when you are told that the symptoms will go away or they may be permanent. No guarantees.  Does anyone know if a person can eat something to give more energy?  How is exercise supposed to help you get energy?  I never had a lot of energy before cancer, but it was a whole lot more than I have now.  Won't it be great when we get our lives back!!!  Whole new outlooks on everything!

I wished I had found this site before.  I would have stocked up on more TV dinners that I could have fixed easily.   It is amazing to read everything.  I heart goes out to all of you.  My prayers.  I just want my life to be the way it was.  Sometimes I feel like such a baby.  I have gotten so that I don't want anymore blood taken out.  I almost cried when the nurse came in last Tuesday evening telling me she needed to take blood.  After the third time, she found a good vien.  The other two she tried started and then stopped letting the blood come out.  I can't believe chemo messes up your veins they way it does. I am to call my surgeon's office tomorrow to let them know about the drainage.  I have other questions to ask to see if it is normal or not.  The swelling has went down a lot, but I still have tenderness and a little redness where it is hallow now (if that makes sense).  I have no idea how much drainage is normal (realizing it will be different for everyone).  I think I am having phantom pain from time to time where the shingles made my nipple extra sensitive.  I was expecting to feel normal now and I now know that was a little unrealistic.  I have staples across my left side and steri-strips on top of the staples.  I feel like I have an extra tight bra on. I am so thankful for this site.  I feel like I have a family I can talk with and see if what I am going through is the same as someone else.  Thank you for letting me spout off.  My feelings also go all over the place - confusion, depression, self-pitying.  And yes, after surgery, you have the complete feeling - it's gone.",

Thank you for all the other comments. As with you others, I can't believe I have breast cancer either.  No one in my family has ever had breast cancer.  My aunt (Mother's sister had colon cancer when she was 80 and is still going strong at 85).  My aunt was fortunate and didn't have to have chemo. When my husband retired December 2004, so did the insurance.  He tried to get social security disability, got it in 10-2006 and then died on Thanksgiving 2006.  I had graduated from college when I was 54 with a degree to teach elementary with an endorsement to teach kindergarten.  Never got a permanent job until this year, six years later.  When I was talking to the insurance person about the type of account you take money out before taxes to use of medical items, I told the man, I NEVER get sick, so I didn't need to have much taken out.  Famous last words!  My insurance went into effect 10-1-2008.  I thought fall break would be a good time to start getting check since I hadn't since 2004.  On October 31st, I had my first mammorgram, with my doctor calling me up on November 4th to say I needed a 2nd mammogram.  I can't believe all the pills you have to take.  I was not one  to get side effects, but I sure did when I was on chemo with the pills I took. I still have two drains in, one could have come out today, but I would have needed to drive 1 1/2 hours one way to my doctor's office.  It is hard to find someone to drive you with a half-hours notice.  I am to call back on Monday.  Hopefully the second drain will be able to come out.  My doctor says it has to be under 25 ccs from each drain.  The second drain is putting out around 30 ccs right now. I am glad to know that others have weird feelings.  I never expected any of this.  I still have pain from where the shingles were on my back.  I know we will finally get our lives back, but sometimes I start wondering when. My pity party is really the fact that I am alone.  My son has already went to his fiance for the weekend.  I know right now that unless I get any phone calls, I will have absolutely no one to talk with.  I think throughout this whole ordeal, that has been the worst part.  I have found out what lonely is.  I really never knew it until now.  Things will be so much different when the tubes are out and I can drive. Again, thank you to whomever started these discussion groups.  Even though I am not talking in person with any of you, this helps so much.  I feel like I am a part of a huge family.  It's good to know you are not the only one going through these different feelings and pains.

The ups and downs of chemo.  What do you do with facial hair when it is very noticeable?  Have a good weekend.  Debbie",

Question:  After you have your tubes out, is it still tender where the tubing was?  It isn't sore like it was, but it just feels like my muscle is tender.  I'm am sure this will all go away, but being an impatient person, I was hoping for it to be completely gone now. :) My grandaughter, Laura - 6 years old, has been asking a lot of questions about everything - chemo, surgery, why did they do that, what is surgery, what did they cut, etc.  Last night DD came over with her.  DD wanted to see what the incision looked like and Laura did too.  I asked DD what she had told Laura about what was done.  She said she had explained they cut away the cancer and the cancer was in MeMe's \"boo-boo\" (she started calling boobs this when her son was little - so if he shouted out about a lady's parts, he would say boo-boo and the lady wouldn't know it). So when DD came into the bathroom where there was more light, Laura wanted to see too.  I said I only had one.  She was surprised and asked to make sure there was only one.  I showed her the incision.  Then she opened up her top and said you don't have two of these now.  I said no.  She just said wow.  I know kids keep asking until they are satisfied with the answer given to them, so now she knows.  Whenever I had a scarf on, she wanted me to take it off so she could feel my hair as it started growing in.   After my hair covered my scalp I didn't wear anything on my head.  In my kindergarten class I had one little boy that would rub my hair as he was talking to me.  Kids understand more than we give them credit for most times, funny and honest.",

I hope your weekend went well.  I feel like a baby anymore.  I used to have such a high tolerance for pain, but not anymore.  I want my radiation done so I can go with my life.  It seems like it has been on hold for so long.  I ready for my strength to come back, my neuropathy to be gone and my eyes to be able to see like they were.  Two out of the three may not happen, but I will definitely take that.  I decided this is my summer of healing - from my husband's death on Thanksgiving 2006 and my cancer.  Also, I am going to declutter my house and my mind.  Wish me luck!

Hope this wasn't too long and maybe some help.  You are in my prayers.  Debbie",

I wish I knew what was normal after surgery and what is not.  It seems you have questions and it is on the weekends and a holiday.  I have been relatively pain free.  I sit on the right side of my love seat.  I have many pillows propping my left arm up.  I had shingles on the left side of my body in March, two days after my last chemo treatment.  I have the pain that I had before the surgery on my shoulder blade.  (I think it is from the shingles).  My left arm feels tired.  My left shoulder aches a little.  I have neuropathy from the taxol that I received so my toes tingle and are numb and my left hand finger tips tingle and my left thumb is numb.  It would be nice just to have someone here with me - just to even talk with.  I have staples in going from my cleavage to my armpit.  I have steri-strips over the staples.  I feel like I have an extra tight bra on.  Sometimes I have pain where my nipple was, but that was also the nerve where the shingles came out on.  My nipple was extra sensitive with the shingles. I am 60 and heavy, but very independent.  I was fortunate enough to be able to work during my chemo treatment - just walked very slow.  I wasn't nauseated.  Like other people have said, a lot depends on the way you feel and the extent of surgery.   I would say yes to having your friends there to help you out.  It is the little things you don't think about and when you are completely by yourself, it would be nice to have help.  I live in a small town where there are no deliveries to your home. I have learned to scoot my rear towards the edge of my seat before I pushed up with my right hand and arm.  I have to be careful on how much I push, because the muscles on the other side get used, too. I have learned to used my right hand for almost everything.",

There may come a time she would need those pictures.  Sheila, I am sorry you had to go through that, too.  Debbie",

There is this lady that posted this and has had no response.  She is really anxious. LoriL wrote: Hello ladies! I had bilateral mast 5/28/09 with a negative Sentinel node biopsy at that time. About 2-3 weeks ago I noticed an enlarged lymph node (a little smaller than the size of a marble) but reasoned that it was from the recent surgery. I started rads 3 days ago since my margins were close, and mentioned the lymph node to my Radiation Oncologist today. He believes it is likely from the surgery, but wants it biopsied just to be on the safe side. Now I'm REALLY worried!  My surgeon was certain that he had identified the correct Sentinel node, but I know that they are not 100% accurate. Has anyone out there had a negative Sentinel node biopsy but then found to have cancer in other nodes??? I was able to get in to see my surgeon tomorrow- I'm hoping he will do a needle biopsy right then in the office. I swear, this is almost worrying me more than I was before the initial cancer diagnosis! I have been breathing a sigh of relief as my Oncotype Dx was low and therefore chemo wasn't needed. But, now, my mind is just racing! Help! ",

I feel for you.  I don't care how old your kids get, they are still your babies.  You hurt so much when they are hurt and struggling. You just want to make everything right. It is so hard sometimes to be a parent of grown children.  You have to let them make their own decisions, even though you have your gut feelings.  Thank the Lord, he stopped and that he is gone.  I hear of so many women that stay in situations that are very unhealthy.  I don't know what makes a person snap.  There is a very fine line. Just be there, as I know you are, as a mother, grandmother, friend, helper, listener - all the things that you do as a mother to grown children.  Hold those grandbabies close whenever they let you.  It sounds like you have a great relationship with them.  They are very fortunate. I would like a fairy tale world, too, where everything goes along great all the time.  Unfortunately, we don't live there.  Please know that we all hold you in our arms.  If we could be the army for Jaclyn and her kids, we would be there.  (((((Cathi))))) (((((Jaclyn and kids))))) Debbie",
