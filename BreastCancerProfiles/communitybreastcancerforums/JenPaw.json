I tried the one from Sally's and it worked out well. I'm only 42 and I just couldn't deal with how much this aged me. I know most people wait longer to color. Anyone else have their hair come in really thin just on top? It's like I have male pattern baldness and it is really patchy. Last chemo was only 6 weeks ago, although my hair started coming back after AC but I was still doing Taxol. I guess I shouldn't expect too much yet?? ",

It's still very short but I want to color it. It's still very thin and patchy on top, but I thought I could wear a wide headband over the top and let the back show. It's summer and getting too hot for the scarves I wear. Anyway, I've read that some women have had their hair turn orange because of the chemicals in the post chemo hair. If I use a semi permanent dye, will this be the case? Can anyone tell me what to use since I'm only 1 1/2 months out from chemo? Also, does herceptin interfere with hair",

PMR53 I started Herceptin and Perjeta in February. I've been off since May 5th for my surgery. I start them both up again on Tuesday and will be getting them every 3 weeks for a year. I guess I just need to accept that I may have very thin hair until all of that is over. Do you feel the biotin helps? Maybe I should try it",
