    "Content": "Nov 22, 2008 06:40PM - edited Nov 22, 2008 06:47PM by TexasGal I was told by the physical therapist that you tend to be protective of the wound area and the shoulder can freeze to provide that protection. It's a matter of coaxing it back into action. I did progressive loosening exercises over the course of a month (I was 9 months out from the original mastectomy) and had almost gotten complete range of motion back - and then I had my exchange/reduction surgery 2 weeks ago. I also do the \"spider up the wall\" exercise. And others, too. If you DO have range of motion issues, perhaps your insurance will pay for a few sessions with a physical therapist to get some advice on exercises to do, and when to do them. I also wanted to mention - I had extreme difficulty with the SNB site healing. The incision kept opening and, after 2 months, we had to remove the expander and get stitched up again. But it still opened up and would not heal. It was about a good 4-5 inch long hole in my underarm.I had to pack it for a couple of months before it healed from the inside out. Because of this (I'm bringing it back to the point of the original post), I couldn't do any kind of exercises at all. I have a large scar and it's very tight at the midpoint of the scar. Now that it's all healed, the exercises I'm doing areÂ loosening up the scar tissue. TexasGal",
