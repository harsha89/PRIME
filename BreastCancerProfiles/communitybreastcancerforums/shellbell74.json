I'm hoping to hear something today, but for now playing the waiting game like everyone else did. I wish they could give you the results the same day so you don't have to go through the anxiety and the worry. I just thank everyone on this wonderful site for letting me express my feelings and fear. After reading some of the posts, I know I'm not alone and someone else knows what I'm feeling, so thank you all again. Hope to hear good news today, but if its not I know I can come here and have someone listen to me. What a great group of caring people!  Some days there won't be a song in your heart - sing anyway Log in to post a reply",

My doctor found a lump during my gyn appointment, and I had a mammogram and ultrasound last Friday and they found 2 more. My history is pretty good (35yrs old, two kids, no history of bc) but I was wondering if anyone else had a good history, but still ended up with bc? I also know 80% end up b9, maybe I shouldn't worry so much and just wait for the results. Any advice would be great Thanks a bunch!

I was mistaken though, I only went yesterday to meet with the surgeon,and look at my mammogram and ultrasound. I go for my biopsy Monday morning. The doctor said he was pretty certain that the lumps would be B9 ( I'm not sure if he said that just to calm to me down,because I was super nervous), but it made me feel better. Thank you again for all the great words of encouragement. This website is wonderful!",
