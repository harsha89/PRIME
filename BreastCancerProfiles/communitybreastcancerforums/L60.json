The surgery lasted less than 1/2 hour, but I am just beginning to feel alert and ready to resume my normal activities...but I am hesitant to push myself. I have had little to know pain from the surgical site, but have lots of pain in my upper arms which has limited my desire to raise my arms. A friend who had a different type of surgery also had this problem and we wonder if it was caused while being moved off the operating table. I would definitely recommend allowing yourself 48-72 hours to recuperate if you do not know how you will react to the anesthesia. ",

Fortunately, I have been fever free for a week. I have also been in contact with the admitting nurse at the hospital so all are aware of my condition. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers!",

The anesthesiologist placed something in the back of my mouth to keep my airways open. That area burned for about 48 hours; it hurt far more than the incision!  My prayers are with everyone who are waiting.",
