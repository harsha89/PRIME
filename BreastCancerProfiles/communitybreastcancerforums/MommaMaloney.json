    "Content": "MommaMaloney wrote: I recently had a stereotactic breast biopsy. It showed atypical ductal hyperplasia. I\u2019m meeting with a breast surgeon at the end of this month. The radiologist recommend I have it removed. Has anyone had surgery to remove microcalcifications in the ducts and if so, did any margins come back as ductal carcinoma?
