I just wonder if she would have said if it did look concerning. I called to make my one week follow up for the surgery site to be checked and they said it would be 7-10 days. My dr. Said 3-5 days.",

There was cell division present but there were no aytipia cells present so it was not precancerous cells that were dividing. I am assuming that it is normal to have cell division as long as there are not atipical cells present? I did get a copy of the path report to keep with my films in case I need it. So I am assuming all is good. She wants to see me in a month to make sure everything heals correctly.",
