I had expanders placed at the time of surgery. I was just told that I need to do radiation due to the tumor being large and aggressive and the edge of the tumor being only 1mm from my chest muscle. I heard that radiation affects reconstruction results and reading this website shows me it's even more so than I thought. I wasn't told that the nipple reconstruction could be compromised by having radiation. I was told that having radiation cuts my chances of getting cancer back from 30 to 3%. I'm still making my mind up as to what to do. I'm thinking that maybe this next step is up to me and healthy eating, mind habits, and lifestyle in general. I think that the chemo would have killed all the cancer cells, but if not, then I can get the rest through alternative means. Can anyone please give me their thoughts. Thank you. Kathy",

Also reconstructed nipples failing, what does that look like? If the implants fail what happens then and what does it look like? Another thought is, if I'm being tested for cancer all the time wouldn't it show up early and if so couldn't I then treat the area with radiation? I guess it's obvious that I don't want radiation. Thanks again. Love, Kathy p.s. New Zealand is so beautiful!! You know the exchange rate is really good at the moment.",

Like healing the body with nutrition and positive healing thoughts? I still really don't want to do radiation because I want a good physical outcome, I'm only 43. Having said that, I also don't want to have any regrets and would really have to believe 100% that it is possible to do the rest of the work myself. In a way it would be much easier for me to do radiation, because making sure I eat the way I'm suppose to is such an effort. Also, getting my thoughts in order so they are working with me and not against me is another big task. Anyway, I'm going to take the next month to think it over. I'm in Australia (I'm Australian) at the moment, my husband (he's American) and I have 123 acres with 4 dogs, 2 goats, & 43 cows. My husband is currently working and living in Reno, Nevada. I had my surgery & most of my treatment done in America, I did do some chemo rounds here when I came back to look after the farm. I was lucky to have my Dad come and help me out with the farm while I was in The States. I miss my husband when we're not together, he was my rock through all this and the whole thing has brought us much closer. I hope other women have the same support. Something else I found invaluable, DOGS!! There is nothing like the healing power and love of dogs.  Thanks for listening. Best wishes and love to all. XX  ",
