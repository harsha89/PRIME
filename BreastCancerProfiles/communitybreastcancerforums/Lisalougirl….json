I was originally diagnosed July 2011 and have been fighting ever since.  I think I had a 6 month break in 2012 with no re-occurrences.  Came back in my lymph nodes, then lungs, then brain (with 10 WBR) kept them at bay until recently, now a spot on my liver and one of the spots on my brain has started to grow again.  According to the Oncologist, he has given me 3-6 months. I am married and have a 3 year old.  I find this hard to wrap my head around it.  I have been really positive and trying to keep it that way but this was quite a blow.  I am starting 8 radiation treatments starting Feb 6 to the brain and lung.  Then another chemo(don't know the name) in hopes to shrink the liver tumor.  Oncologist gives the chemo a 5% chance of working.  Hey, I would take 1-2% chance at this point!  What else can we do? I'm still trying to navigate this sight and takes me awhile to find a reply.  Is there an easier way than going through all the posts? Hugs, Lisa",
