    "Content": "ScarletandCooper wrote: Hello there. I'm an almost 50 year old mom of 2 in Maine. After 4 years of healthy mammograms, my scan from this year earned me a call back requesting further imaging. Like all of you, I suspect, I freaked out. No family history, healthy, no reason to think this would ever be an issue for me. Went in for another mammogram, got asked for an ultrasound. Did ultrasound, got the call back for a biopsy. Now I've just seen my percentages (according to the internet) jump from less than 9 percent chance of cancer up 30 percent. To say I'm scared to death is an understatement. I have a 21 year old daughter with severe special needs and I'm her sole caregiver. I have to live forever, y'all. I was too scared and in shock at the time to ask for a birad score, I didn't even know what it was last week. There's no lump that I can feel (small boobs). I'd love to hear from anyone else going thru this waiting hell so I can stop Googling and scaring myself stupid. Log in to post a reply",
