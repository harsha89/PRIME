You are right, my sister can not have rads again but will start chemo is 4-6 weeks ( once she is healed). Yes, her pain is from the surgery. She had a double mastectomy this past Tuesday. Her strength is amazing. I just hate to see her flinch or stop and take a deep breath. She has four drain scoming out of her chest. It breaks my heart. I will start a new post about the post matectomy pain. I have been reading them but need some more advice. I will keep in touch as I learn more about her chemo from lung cancer as, right now, I do not want to bother with those questions. How is your prognosis?  I am reading that it is still good even with treatment for Hodgkin's (one study I read said it was comparable to the\"normal poulation\" of breast cancer victims). I am probably reading way too much, just looking for hope. K",

After my sister went through radiation for her Hodgkin's, she developed lung cancer. She then weht through chemo (about 16-17 years old). I do not know if was MOPP but will try to find out from my parents ans sister for you. So ,a anyway, she had chemo for another cancer. Now I am wondering. Are you doing okay?",
