Bilateral mastectomy left was simple but right was modified radical. I wear a compression sleeve on my right arm when I am awake, and supposed to keep it elevated when I sleep to ward off lymphodemia. I don't always succeed with that, I wake up in some rather weird positions lately. I also wear a warning not to use that arm for medical procedures, not even blood pressure. I still have the stitches in, but no longer wearing the breast binder or bandaging. I go back to see the surgeon on May 1st. That is my issue. I was told I would need chemo when I returned, and radiation after that. Now, on the basis of the Oncotype score of 19 both breasts same score. They no longer believe I need chemo. My oncologist called this a low to intermediate risk of occurrence or metastasizing. He said the chemo will only give me a 5% advantage, and not worth the risks and side effects. Those 5 people out of 100 would probable disagree with him, in my opinion. He said we will talk about it at my appointment on May 2. Also changed several the cancer characteristics from the biopsy to the surgery pathology: March 13 Biopsy Rt breast Er+; Pr+ ;HER2Positive(FISH); Ri-67 15-20% March 28 Surgical Rt breast Er+; Pr-; HER2Negative(not FISH,IHC); Ri-67 low March 13 Biopsy Lt breast Er+;Pr+ HER2 Negative(FISH); Ri-67 1-5% March 28 Surgical Lt breast Er+;Pr+ HER2Equivical(FISH pending); Ri-67 low The original size of the tumors when they did the ultrasound guided needle core biopsy wasn't very big 1.2 x 1.4 x1 cm and with 6 passes through each tumor, it doesnt leave much intact to biopsy for the surgery. I would assume the needle core would be more accurate, but I am not a pathologist. Also, there was sentinal lymph involvement on the right side. The tumor in the lymph was 2.6 cm and extranodal extension, meaning it burst out of the lymph node. They removed all the level 1 and level 2 nodes and 2/15 were positive on the right, they removed 3 sentinal lymphnodes and all 3 were clear on the left side. I have read some information on Oncotype that it isn't accurate where lymphnodes are concerned. Then I read that if 1-3 lymph are involved it is still accurate. But what about the fact it burst ope the lymph and assuming it is now in the lymph system. How could both breasts have the same oncotype score when only one was in the lymphnodes. The Her2 score that was Positive with a FISH, then negative with the less accurate IHC . The left breast is still pending for FISH, but that has been since April 11. I am afraid I am becoming a number, and if they are comparing apples to oranges to decide my treatment, I am scared. I also read that mammoprint is more accurate than oncotype. An intermediate score in oncotype comes back sometimes as high risk in a mammoprint score, or it could come back as low risk. but they say there is no correlation between the number if it is identified as an oncotype intermediate score. They have had oncotype scores of 18-19 come back as high risk in a mammoprint, and they have had an oncotype score of 24 come back as low risk in a mammoprint. Anyone else have these issues? I have called another cancer treatment center for a second opinion, but they don't have anything for 3 weeks. I also heard that if you don't have chemo withing 4 weeks of your surgery, and you need it, your survivability drops by 10% each month you delay. I guess what I need to know, is did anyone else's pathology change so drastically after surgery? and anyone not have chemotherapy when there was extranodal extension? One more question, I am taking arimidex and have been since March 22. My cholesterol jumped up 74 points and now my primary care physician wants me on statins. Anyone else have cholestrol problems with arimidex?",

Sentinel lymphs right and left. 2/19 nodes No reconstruction. I am healing very well except the 2 seromas on my left axiliary. A second opinion MO was concerned about the lump and I had an ultrasound to rule out cancer issues. He also had me have a CAT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvic areas, the results of those should be back soon. Not sure if I should be concerned about a 3.6 cm seroma or not, anyone else know much about seromas? I am a bit concerned about how I tell my MO I went for a second opinion. I want these 2 doctors to discuss my treatment plan, but they differ on their opinions. One says definitely chemo and suggested 2 different treatment plans and will decide after the cat scans and a full consultation of the team there and the other just wants radiation and hormone treatment, but also plans to put this before the tumor board regarding the aggressive lymph node involvement. I have positive nodes with extra-nodal extension, it was a 2.6 cm of focal extension, (if I stated that right). I have also been on Arimidex for the past 8 weeks. 2 weeks prior to surgery. Anyone been on Arimidex prior to surgery and have chemo? Is the arimidex stopped before the chemo? When is it stopped? Arimidex slows the growth, and chemo works on fast growing cells. If I wait 2 weeks after I stop the arimidex before the chemo, what keeps those cells from growing out of control. I remember what happened after the biopsy, that tumor in the lymph grew from 0 to 2.6 cm in 9 days. What about the radiation therapy do they stop the Arimidex before radiation? I know I will have radiation on my sternum, collarbone chest wall and right axillery for 5 weeks. They also disagree about the radiation along the sternum. I think about if this comes back, and I didn't treat it aggressively, what if I treated it more aggressively, would it still have come back? I am sure that is a question we all have to decide for ourselves. But for me, I think I want every possible way to attack this cancer. If it still comes back, at least I know I did everything possible at the time. On a good note, I feel great. Exercising again on the tread mill and recumbent bike I did 1 mile walking 3.0 m/h and 4 miles on the bike, 3 times a week. and lost 61 lbs in just under 1 year. Still losing about 2 lbs a month on a very low carb diet.",

Now 8 weeks later, I am had some really severe pain when I stretched my right arm out to reach for something, then my arm above the elbow was quite tender to even touch for a while after that stretch. It was bad, I am afraid to stretch it again. Not so bad now, but that really surprised me. I have been going to a PT person once every 2-3 weeks and she massages my right arm quite a bit, she said there is still cording and is trying to take care of that. I was also given some exercises to do at home daily which I am faithfully doing since my appointment on Wednesday this week. The only difference was the heavy massaging that was painful on Wednesday and the stretching exercises I have been doing since Wednesday. I see her again in 2 weeks. But why all the pain now? I did not have hardly any pain after surgery. I see my oncologist on Tuesday and will tell him. I don't see the surgeon again till after chemo and radiation. That won't be till sometime in September. Anyone else experience this kind of later pain relating to the lymph-node removal and Mastectomies? Do you think I should see if I can see my surgeon? Or is this normal healing.",

Then they added that as long as you were less than 4 nodes involved, the onca score was still valid. I fail to understand how someone with zero nodes could be in the same recurrence statistics as someone with 1-3 nodes. One of my positive nodes was not a sentinel node, I had 2 positive nodes. I also had bilateral cancer, doesn't that mean a cumulative score for recurrence? I had a 3 % recurrence with my left breast and no nodes and Her2-. Then add in the fact I was also right breast HR+ Her2+ and extranodal. So does that mean you ignore the left breast completely? Doesn't that also warrant a 3% recurrence without chemo? He still stands by his stats that I only got a 3% value to my 6 cycles of chemo. I believe it was more like 6% +3% for the left, then add in the Her2+ and that I believe is a huge increase increase in value. I had chemo. Bravo for tumor boards!

The call back took 2 weeks, not sure if it was choices related or not, but it held up my treatment. I also wanted a second opinion and that proved almost impossible because a VA Dr can not request an outside 2nd opinion and getting a 2nd opinion in this area proved very difficult without a referral from the original dr. That was how I ended up at CTCA, they did not require a referral. But dealing with choices, I could not not even get a biopsy without a surgeon and that appointment as over 2 more weeks out. So my mammogram of February 17, 2017 was suspicious was not going to even see a surgeon until March 14 then she would have ordered a needle core biopsy so 6 weeks after my mammogram before even a biopsy with a biRad score of 5. I still have a VA Dr as my primary care, but I have very little confidence in the VA. I just hope my Blue Cross holds out, I am getting close to the million dollar cap and then all I will be able to use is VA. I hope our Detroit VA improves. CUrrently it is listed as the worst reviews in the country",

This happened several times and I made a note to myself, if anyone else was having radiation therapy that they should ask about machine breakdowns and plans to keep up the planned treatments without delays during such issues.

I believed my cancer was spread to the lymph nodes through the biopsy, and this is just more evidence. Kinda scary to think though, that the current expected level of care is actually promoting cancer. I hope they continue their study and change the way cancer is treated. People use to think years ago just opening someone up that has cancer would spread it. I remember hearing people saying once air hits the cancer cells it spreads like wildfire, and there is somewhat a bit of truth to that, although, not the air that causes the proliferation, but the dislocation of cells entering the bloodstream and lymph system. The downside is you must be treated or it spreads anyways. It might have spread even before the biopsy, so if we need a biopsy to be treated currently, then my suggestions is to do everything you can to make sure those tiny cells are not in an environment that is hospitable and allows them to grow. Ketorolac for inflammation and change of diet ( high protien, low carb, no sugar), radiation for the stray cells and chemo for those that escaped.",

Make sure you have support the first time you see yourself. I was a DD before my bilateral mastectomy (March 28th, 2017). I am completely flat and did not get prosthetics until 2 weeks ago. I went only where I needed to go, but everyone noticed, of course. I bought some sport bras to wear that gave me some definition in the breast area. I was fine if I was around strangers. I now have my prosthetics, but they hurt my chest. I can wear them for a few hours, and I have, but I have pretty much gotten used to the flat and not wearing a bra at all. I don't know if I will have reconstruction in the future, but right now, I prefer to just be flat if I am around strangers, and when I must go out in public where I will see acquaintances, I can wear my prosthetics for a short time. I have 2 sets, one is silicone and very heavy, the other is microbeads, but still too much to wear for long periods of time.",

I did it more for the advantages in treating the cancer, Dr. Longo of California did a study of mice with breast cancer. 1/2 were fed, the other half were given only water for 2 days. Then given 1 dose of chemo. The 1/2 that were fed were all dead in 180 days. The 1/2 that fasted were all alive and cancer free at 300 days. He said, to transfer this to humans we need to fast for 5 days before rather than 2. There is a fast-like diet that he has developed, you can google it if you want to try it but can't handle the fasting. I find it easier to eat nothing than to limit my food. I also can afford to lose a few lbs, but I have so far gained it all back before the next fast. Now that I am on TCHP however, the side effects are much worse and not sure it is helping the side effects. I was right in bed the 3rd day after and didn't feel like myself for about a week. However I was able to function reasonably well after the 4th day post chemo. I go for more chemo again on Tuesday, so I will let you know. My last chemo wasn't my best experience.

My chemo was 5 premeds, Aloxi, Benadryl,Decadron, Pepcid, and Emend. Then, Taxotere and Cytoxan. It took 6 hours because I have the dignicap, in hopes to save my hair. My surgery was March 28th; Bilateral MX and Lymph dissection on right because of 2 positive sentinel nodes, one of them was extra-nodal and larger than my tumors. Sentinel nodes on left was clear, but they removed 4 of them. The plan was just 5 weeks of rather complicated radiation, and then more hormone treatment (I have been on arimidex since before my surgery, just stopped it the day of chemo), but my second opinion MO definitely wanted me on Taxotere and cytoxan, or AC +T ; my MO reluctantly agreed with TC. So we started the next day, Wednesday May 17th. What a whirlwind. No time to obsess at all. My Oncology breast surgeon is also on board with chemo and told me he was supporting me on that. I was on my way driving home when the Nuelesta began the injection, but it was no problem at all. I have no issues, except a bit foggy. I ate some pork spareribs without the spices last night when I got in, It was the day after, and it caused a bit of queasy feeling, but didn't last long. I have tingling in my mouth, and sensitivity there as well. I feel a bit weird on my feet and fingers. Like maybe I might be starting a bit of neuropathy, I will make sure I do the ice on my feet and hands next time, The nurse didn't think it was necessary. But, I would rather be safe than sorry, since this is all supposed to be cumulative. I have a cocktail they prescribed for mouth sores, it is lidocaine, benydril and maalox, I swish it around and swallow 5-10 mg 3-4 times a day before meals and bedtime. My mouth is still a bit sore though. I also have tried the soda and water whenever it starts to bother me. It seems water makes it worse, but black coffee doesn't. I am still trying to drink lots of water. I plan to get the biotin, thanks for the suggestion :) I really have no other issues, except today I am a bit more tired than yesterday. I slept well every night. So, 1 down and 3 more to go! My 2nd opinion MO is still making more studies regarding my HER-2 status. I was HER-2 +3 (strong positive) prior to surgery and arimidex treatment, and now suddenly it is HER-2+0 (negative) Same test. the FISH was equivocal. That seems to be an issue with him and he is going to track down the cause of the sudden change and get back to me on that. So my treatment might change. I did not take the claritin the day of the nuelesta( yesterday) but I took one today, I forgot. I hope I don't have that pain. Thanks everyone for sharing, so we know what we can do to ward of some of these S.E. and to know what we are feeling is normal for us.   ",

I will see if I can find it as well. My Ki-67 was 20% for my right breast tumor and my onca score was 19 for that breast. My Ki-67 score was <5% for my left breast and that came back 16 onco score. Then the right tumor was sent to mammaprint and it came back as low. I still had chemo though, because I was her+ and extra nodal. However, my insurance is not wanting to pay so I am getting billed for lots of money. ",

As opposed to the radiology department with a radiologist. The scheduling department could not find an operating room during my chemo week so they delayed my chemo by 9 days and asked me if that was ok. I loved the idea of having an extra week of no side effects especially since the family had planned a huge get together that week and I was going to be pretty sick during all the get togethers and the pig roast and all the festivities. My chemo is TCHP and I am right in bed for the 3rd day and feel pretty bad for almost a week. The family get together is the week I should be having my chemo, (pig roast on the 3rd day post chemo) but now they delayed it a full 9 days and I will be able to enjoy my family without those horrible SE. So, I told them yes. Then, I mentioned it to my oncologist. The scheduling department worked for days to get in all my appointments, I need to see several Drs. and genetic consult, ct scan, primary care appointment, Port consult, port surgery and my 5-6 hours of infusions. It will be 3 days.of appointments with the chemo the final day after the port. Well, now the oncologist said not to delay my chemo. He wants me to have the port inserted by the radiologist, not the surgeon if it will delay my chemo. He is not aware of my family plans, but he sure doesn't think me wanting a surgeon is reason enough to delay it, I hate to pester him about it again and risk getting him upset. He really is not an easy person to work with sometimes, he likes to make all the decisions. I really do not want a radiologist doing my surgery. I want to ask for ketorolac pre- incision to lessen the inflammation issues and possible recurrences (there is a thread about this and several studies) and I believe a real surgeon would be better equipped to handle any problems that might arise. I have had 3 chemo treatments, this will be my 4th. 2 were TC and 1 was TCHP I am not scheduled to see my oncologist when I go, just his nurse, should I chance just showing up a week and a half late? I feel very strongly about the ketorolac and having a real surgeon. Does anyone know if a 9 day delay of my 2nd TCHP infusion might hurt my treatment plan? Anyone else ask for a 1-2 week delay and have success in getting their oncologists blessing?

I did not have lymph node involvement prior to my biopsy, it was not palpable or visible with ultrasound. Nine days after my needle core biopsies (I did have bilateral cancer and they did 2 needle core biopsies of 5 and 6 passes, each breast) there was lymph node involvement. It grew to 2.6cm it just 9 days and burst the lymph node. Perhaps it was there prior to the biopsy but too small to identify, but something caused it to grow to 2.6cm in 9 days. I believe it was the biopsy and inflammation. Insist on the ketorolac preincision, I do now for all surgeries and if my surgeon refuses, I find a new surgeon.",

Retained clips lead to diminished quality of CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images around the wound and may cause complications.

I am sure my needle cores spread my cancer to my lymph nodes. I would also fast for all my chemos, I didn't know about fasting for my 1st chemo, so I missed that one, but have fasted 5 days before each chemo, this will be my 4th chemo this coming week.

Day 4 was better, but still definitely not able to function well at all.. I slept a lot, could not eat day 3 at all. Able to eat day 4, and day 5 I am feeling much better. Constipation is bad too. The Dr. office called today to inform me each chemo the SE's get worse, I now have 3 more to go. Yeuck!!! I did not want to know that, but at least I can be prepared to have someone stop over to get me water when I can't get out of bed to get it myself. I won't post here anymore since my treatment is no longer TC. Take care everyone and best of luck to you all! I envy you guys almost finished.....",
