She is Stage IV 4IDC, with many DCIS ER+, PR+, Her2+, 5/11 nodes, Bone Mets Spine  & Ribs, 2.7 cm Grade 3 and is 33 years of age (bilateral Mas.). She is on Herceptin and has been given taxol and carboplatin. I guess she is day 8 of her treatment and is experiencing no side effects except for slight numbness in her fingertips and toes. I understand that Chemo side effects can be accumulative, but is it really normal to feel mainly ok? (Honestly, I think I am just seeking reassurance that the treatment is working). Her name is mcmanus33 if anyone can relate with her age, treatment and diagnosis. Thank you! <3",

I am hoping that the 'smart bomb' or something equivalent crosses the boarder to the north soon! Thanks again, I will pass along this discussion thread to her.",

They found cancer in her lymph nodes and in her spine and ribs. She is 33 years of age and a mother of two (youngest 5 years). They are going to only give her a total of 4 chemo treatments and a lifetime of herceptin; hopefully to slow the cancer down? They told her that if she was only stage 3 they would treat her more aggressively. I guess im just wondering if there is a place to seek out clinical trials? I am having a hard time understanding how the risks out weigh the benifits here, having never experienced first hand. Thanks, :)",
