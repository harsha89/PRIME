Firstly, this was one of the first websites I found when my sister was diagnosed. I found it to be an invaluable resouce for information as well as inspiring. You are all such wonderful people and it is truly a great community you all have here. Secondly, thank you for being such a wonderful support group for my sister. She is so fond of all of you and wanted to be sure that, through me, you are all updated on how she is doing. I'm sorry for not updating earlier. I drove 9hrs. through the night to arrive here with her on Monday morning at 6:30am. Between spending time with her and trying to sleep a bit I didn't have time to write before now. Heidi just completed her 5th radiation treatment today. It is hard for her but I have seen an improvment even from yesterday as it pertains to her being alert. I think this is mainly due to her and her docs figuring out her pain meds as well as all the other drugs she is on. The radiation is making her slightly disoriented. It is too early to tell what the radiation is doing to her cancer. I got to meet her fabulous ONC today. He is truly a great guy. We are hoping that she can get out of the hospital and be at home with her family in the next day or two. Her kids have been able to have a visit with her in the hospital for the past two days. Thanks to all of you again for your prayers and support. I will update as much as I can. Bobby (Heidi's Little Bro) ",

She has not had to go back into the hospital so far which has been really nice for her, she is able to be at home with her family. The treatments are very hard on her and she sleeps most of the day but is more awake in the evenings. Her spirits remain positive and she looks forward to finishing this stage of the treatment. Our family is strong and so full of love for her. Best wishes to all of you, Little Bro ",

I am posting because I'm sure all of you are wanting updates on how our Heidi is doing. I am updating even though not much has changed in her condition. She is now in a coma, which is what the doctors had told her would likely happen with her Leptomeningeal to which she was pleased about. I have done a bit of reading now on coma's and realize that she has been \"slipping\" into a coma for the past week or so. However, she is now in the type of coma that is the common idea of what a coma is. The good news is that this means she is pain free and peacefully sleeping. Her vital signs are still very low but she has a young body that doesn't want to quit. Our family is strong and coping well due to the amazing support we are getting both by all of you as well as her tremendous network of friends here in her hometown. Thank you all so much!! Lil Bro ",

She is a special person and has shown incredible fight and spirit considering every fork in the road she has encountered on her cancer journey has lead her to a tougher place. Today was meant to be her last day of radiation but she has decided not to go. She is too weak and fragile. Everyday has been such an ordeal for her to get to the hospital. Unfortunately, last week scans showed that her radiation treatment is ineffective in helping/reducing her Leptomeningeal. We knew this already because she has steadily lost function. The doctors told her that she didn't have to go anymore but she still battled on right up until today. She has told our family that she is \"ready\". She told her kids yesterday that she won't make it and the family have all gathered here at her house for her final days. I'm sorry to have to write this to all of you because I know she is special to you and it is hard to hear when a \"breast friend\" isn't triumphing. She loves you all so much and appreciates the support you have given her. I will update again, but the thought of it at this time is surreal. Love to all of you, Little Bro ",

The family has been able to have group as well as individual meetings with Heidi. She would be awake for a couple of hours here and there and was relatively lucid. These meetings were prescious to all of us. However, over the last couple of days Heidi has requested no more visitors. I believe it is difficult for her to rally the strength for meetings and she also doesn't feel that she is functioning on a level that makes these meetings worth the effort. Her husband continues to be with her almost all day long. She is generally pain free and is now on a constant drip for her pain meds. She has told us that she is very happy and content and that she wishes to pass as soon as possible. I believe (i know) her biggest fear right now is for this part of her journey to be protracted, and as strange as it may sound, we are all hoping for her wish to come true. Thank you all so much for your support. My family reads this board every day and are brought to tears with the amazing words you send our beautiful Heidi as well as support for us. You are all very special people. Will update again, Little Bro ",

I have been very fortunate to have had her as my big sister for my entire life up until now, and I am so happy to see that so many of you have been able to see her magic, even through a message board. She really is one of a kind. Heidi continues to weaken, though I would not have thought it possible. The hospice nurse said if she were older she would already be in a coma, but her brain is young and still wants to remain active. Communicating with her is hard because she is in such a weakened state. She can only whisper a few words here and there. She generally says the same thing to me each time I see her.... She asks how I am doing (classic Heidi style) and tells me she loves me. Yes, i've been blessed with an incredible sister!! We had been waiting for her vital signs to weaken, and they did two days ago (pulse rate up, blood pressure down). I thought this would give me the weird relief I talked about earlier because it is what Heidi wants, but it didn't. I felt my stomach drop into my feet. I now understand how we are never fully prepared. I think (and I emphasize \"think\") Heidi is right at the end of her Cancer journey. Again, I appreciate you all so much for the outpouring of support and prayers for Heidi and I hope the prayers will continue at this very critical time.  You are all such amazing women!!!!! Heidi Ho's Little Bro ",
