My doctor ordered a follow up sono which i had today and i saw and asked what it was and she said it was a lymph node. You cannot see them unless there is a problem. The mass/cyst is still the same size, no change. I'm more concerned with the Lymph node, it wasnt on the first sono. Is it something to be concerned about? Log in to post a reply",
