By the way, some bio info, am 55, no children, a bit overweight, enjoy my wine and coctails from time to time, and took HRT for 3 yrs 7 months, so I have just about every risk indicator for BC ther is other than family history!  Am thankful to have a DH of 31 years who is the king of my world these days, as I do not know how I could have or would have dealt with these last months and the ones to come without him. By the way at the beginning of this post, it said Weenie Warriors, I prefer to think of us as Warrior Women, (we would have been Amazons in the time of the greeks) as we wage battle against this thing!",

First, BrendaSharon, MeNeverMind, Melinda41,JustmeAlicia,Shel. and anyone else I may have missed above.  THANK YOU you all for your kind words and support, am just home from my 1st TX, and it wasn't bad at all!  Not sure if it was the lidocain cream my onco RX'd me, or just that the chemo nurse was so good at what he does.  Didn't even feel the needle go in the port.  The only issue they had was trying to draw blood back from my port, so after much fuss, they tried the other (I have a dual and didn't feel the prick into that one either!) same results.... so then they put in what he lovingly called caterter 'draino' and then both worked fine.  I will admit to a moment of weakness and fear when they brought me into the infusion room.  I was just so well lit and clincial, with all the machines around the chairs (one of which I later found out was a personal TV set, duh!).  So got a little teary for a moment or too.  But they came over, hugged me and moved me to another chair further in the back so people didn't have to see me freak.  Like I said, only lasted a few secs, and did make me feel a bit foolish later. After the port was working, the rest was a piece of cake. First they gave me some saline, then they added in an anti-emitic (I had already taken my first Emend pill as prescribed, so wasn't expecting even more aniti-nasea meds.)  Then the added in he called 'very light' steroids, so will have to see if I become an eating machine in the next few days like I've heard some of the other warriors do!  One more surprise was Adavan, to relax me (wish they would have given me that when I was out in the waiting room!!  They let me rest for a 1/2 hour, then the real stuff began.  First the Fluorouacil, quick and easy, one large syringe, then the Epirubicin, 5 large syrynges, that he injected into the line, one by one, stopping to pull the plunger back to pull blood out every so often.  Guess this is the bad stuff, that they don't want to anywhere else but into the port.  Lastly the Cyclophosphomide, and little bag that dripped into the port line nice and slow for 30 mins.   So all in all about 2 hours of actual chemo. How do I feel? Well,he did tell me any side effects probably won't start until 6 to 8 hours after. But I feel fine, a teeny bit, I don't know how to say... but disconnected,not dizzy, perhaps a little drowsy, maybe a 'very light foggy' would be the right term.  So that is where I am, and most of all I AM SOOOOOOOO HAPPY THE FIRST ONE IS OVER, and now I know at least that the actual procedure is no big deal at all...  I have had less comfortable breast exams! Oh, Sharon, thanks for the tip on the mets, mine was like yous I had my onco called a less than 2mm micro metastis in the 2nd of my two positive nodes when they did the ALND.  Will change my diagnosis too... and now you are right we match even more! So my next TX is Dec 3rd, and the last is Dec 24th (Happy Holidays!), then three weeks later I go onto another chemo I think it is Taxotere for the next 12weeks, then chemo will be done. Well, now it is waiting and watching.  My husband will give me my nuelasta shot tomorrow afternoon (the pharmacy delivered it) can see driving all the way to a center just to get shot. Oh and not sure if this helps ccnani the onco nurse said they don't always prescribe neulasta and emend, but some chemo combos has a much higher incindence of servere nausea, and it turns out that the epirubicin, I guess is really nasty on the stomach and system... so I think that is why they just RX'd it automatically.  Not sure the cocktail you are getting, but perhaps you  are lucky and getting a lighter version with lower nausea side effects! Later, Warrior Princesses!!.... will see how it goes in the next day or two, and check back in with you all. Thank you all for all of your help!  And Brenda yes, the fear ended today!",

And am up and about this morning, feeling, dare I say it, almost normal?  Thanx to everyone here's fantastic advice I am drinking water like a fiend, probably 2 gallons yesterday, and plan to do the same today, and I am thinking that my be why I am doing better than I had expected.  Took the second Emend tab today, so knock on wood, no nausea yet, took one and later another of the compazine when my stomach feelt 'bubbly' yesterday evening, and then about 3 am this morning, along with some ibuprophen for what felt like might becoming a headache, but cut them both off at the pass. My only fear now, in my normal pessimistic way, is the sword in still hanging and the real SE's will hit...so it is just a waiting game.  My DH will give me my Neulasta shot later this afternoon (has to be at least 24 hrs after chemo) so will get to see if the bone pain is an issue. doronet - do they give you adivan as an Rx too?  I just thought they shot you up with it prior to the chemo.  It did make me drowsy, do you take it to sleep?  I used to take unisom. but saw it has 'dry mouth' side effects, which I thought was not good with the chemo, so was actually asking my onco nurse what other options there were... she hasn't gotten back to me yet. Oh, one funny thing I forgot to tell you all, not sure if it was the adivan, or just my own twisted mind, but when these what I had been thinking of as 'toxic' drugs were being pushed into my body, I suddely thought of PAC MAN!...   all those hungry little guys running through my veins eating up any sneaky cancer cells!  It made me laugh out loud, and suddenly it just didn't seem as scary! We can always make lemonade Warriors! Hang Strong!",

It's funny, everyone is so paranoid about nationalized health care, but I am a retired naval officer, and my insurance is Tricare Humana, which the government has negotiated to very reasonable rates for retirees.  I only wish congress and the senate would allow them to do the same for all the rest of the people in the US who would like that option.

And Brenda you are just the best!  And dealing with the dizziness sounds like it sux, so hang in there!  could compazine or other anti nausea drugs help, even sea sick drugs like bonine? ccnani, liquids, I am a believer as I am still feeling pretty good, more than 24 hours now,  My chemo nurse recommended the equivalent of 6 20oz bottles of water per 24 hour period, and I have been following it.  As some have already suggested crystal lite it great, but any liquid, tea, koolaid, it all helps to mix it up with the H2O to help you feel like you aren't floating away. Wigs:  I ordered mine from wigsalon.com, they are out of Miami here.... great selection, and though they are expensive, they have various sales and discounts going on,  I too got a Rene of Paris - Tia, and a back up Raquel Welch - At Ease.... both monofilament so they are not abrasive.  So am ready to shave in about 2 weeks!  Finally uploaded a photo, I took scissors to my hair last weekend, hence the slightly punk look, but less to shave in the not so distant future!
