I'm 42, Diagnosed in October when going though a required updated mammogram to do IVF (we have a 3 yo and want a 2nd child) Obviously the ICD diagnosis stopped my IVF (but we were able to do a quick egg retrieval cycle before my mastectomy surgery and will be looking at a surrogate and adoption later this year.) I also was diagnosed with a CHEK2 mutation. My path report said cancer was found in LESS than 1mm clear margin. My IDC lump was right on my pectoral muscle sheath. They removed the sheath in the surgery. Had small node involvement- 1.7mm (micromets) in 1/3 sentinel nodes. It sounds like the cut off for chemo recommendation is 2mm. I'm about to start radiation. My low oncotyope score 10, so my MO said no chemo, but recommends shutting down my ovaries over the next 6 months then removing my ovaries and being on AI for the next 10 years. ER+ (100%) /PR+ (90%) HER2- (yes, I know I'm lucky with this) HOWEVER, I've heard/read some stories (here and in my CHEK2 support groups) where oncs said NO to the need for more node removal or, NO to the need for chemo....and yet sometimes it turns out there was more cancer somewhere and months/years later diagnosed with late stage advancements! I am young and healthy and i want to be aggressive to have the best chances of making this go away. I'd rather deal with it now (already having time off of work) than after we expand our family again! Has any one had this experience and how do you know your MO is doing the right thing by just doing RADS? In 10 years I'll have a 13 yo daughter (and hopefully a 9 yo child, as well!) so talking 5 yr outcomes is frustrating. I'm talking 50 yr outcomes!",
