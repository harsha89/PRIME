I'm a 32 yr old mother of 3 (14, 9, and 5) and 24 weeks pregnant with my 4th. About 6 weeks ago I was just fooling around one night with \"the s\" and felt the lump. I told my midwife about it at my next appt which happened to be about 5 days later. She felt it, said it could just be hormonal changes, as I was about 18 weeks along at that point but sent me for an ultrasound. I had that done about 2 weeks later, and the very next day had an appt with a surgeon/internist for 6 days later. I saw the report and it said \"may or may not be carcinoma\". Once there, he said there IS reason to worry because of my hormones, size and shape of lump and the fact that it was changing rapidly. I had a mammogram this past Wednesday, and an ultrasound guided biopsy yesterday. Reading other posts, I guess it's called the stereotactic biopsy? It was a large needle that clicked loudly when the sample was taken. Oddly enough I'm still sore on that side tonight. I'm terrified right now. I can barely eat, I can't sleep, I can barely think, and I'm having panic attacks which I hardly ever get. My kids are completely unaware. I didn't want to scare them if it turns out to be nothing. I've been taken off of work until Mid-May for a pinched nerve in my back, so I don't have alot to keep my mind occupied. My fiancee is trying to be strong for me, but he's scared as well and I've noticed some distance between us lately. Between hormones and stress I think I'm pushing, plus he's trying not to let me see him worry. My grandmother had bc, my sister had stage 4 melanoma, my mom passed away at my age from something unrelated to bc, but it still scares the crap out of me. How do you get through the waiting? I'm really not doing ok with this. Ok, I just totally rambled on mindlessly, but it helped. Thanks for being here. Log in to post a reply",

I have found some shoulders at church, but they haven't really had anything like this and don't know what to say, so they simply say they're praying for me and move on to another subject. I'm having a really hard time finding people in real life to talk to and I just feel so alone right now. Fiancee and I are having a few problems right now and he really is little comfort. All he tells me is everything will be fine, and although his words are meant to be comforting, they really aren't. He doesn't know everything will be ok. He said the same thing when I had a miscarriage last year. \"The baby will be fine\" he told me. Duke, I'm sorry about your mother (i think i read that right) testing positive for the gene. I know testing positive for the gene isn't necessarily a good thing, but it's good she got the test and now can be proactive. I'm still a little sore, and I can't seem to find a sports bra to fit me. I'm a 40 DDDD/G and short of ordering one online I'm out of luck on that one. I've just been wearing a very supportive bra and it seems to help a little. I actually didn't bruise quite as bad as they warned me I would, so that's a good thing. Thank you for your words. Sueper, thank you as well. I have labored AND had surgery for my children, so I know all aspects of the pain of childbirth, although I'm feeling not so strong lately. I feel like I can't breathe alot of the time, and today I had a very hard time even getting out of bed. I really have so much more than just these biopsy results going on and I feel completely overwhelmed and alone. I like to have control over things (or at least feel as if I do lol), and right now I feel as though I have absolutely no control over anything and it's terribly out of my comfort zone. My kids really don't suspect anything. I've had some complications during this pregnancy which has resulted in periods of bedrest, and quite a few hospital visits, so they attribute it to that. If there is anything to tell them, I will do so age appropriately. The few people that know about it, know not to talk about it in front of them, so they don't overhear anything. They have been through ALOT this last year and a half and I don't want them to be worried needlessly. I appreciate your advice, I really do! Luv, thank you so much. I have been reading that 80% is benign, but my luck usually falls the other way. lol I'm one of the few that got pregnant on the pill, have morning sickness throughout the entire pregnancy, have infections that oral antibiotics won't cure, the list goes on. I'm really trying my hardest to stay positive, and telling myself there is nothing I can do to control this situation at all, it's in the Lords hands. His will has already been done, but it's still hard to accept. Thank you all for your kind words, knowledgeable advice, and for listening to my incessant ramblings. I guess when I get started I have a hard time stopping. LOL",
