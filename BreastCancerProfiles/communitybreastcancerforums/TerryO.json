The surgeon sd he thought he got it all so we are optimistic. There will be a follow up CT in a couple of weeks and spot on rads. Gamma as needed. As of about 2 hrs after sx Cathy was in ICU, awake, talking, eating ice chips. Does not appear to be deficit to speech, coordination or motor function as best as can be assesse from the bed. She is on pain meds of course, her head is wrapped in a delightful bandage, and she is asking about dinner. Well maybe tomorrow for the last one. I will keep everyone posted as information develops. Dr. sd she might go to reg room tomorrow and may go home Sun or Mon. Thank you everyone again....TerryO",

The radiation thus is precautionary, just to make sure nothing microscopic was missed. We had to be here at 6 a.m. It is now almost 2 pm and they just took her back for tx. They put a halo thing on her head this morning, with four screws (ouch). Continuing to be optimistic. Appreciate all the prayers.  TerryO",

Had a follow up CT 4 a.m. Saturday morning, Dr. said it looked fine. Please continue to keep her in your thoughts and prayers. I cannot tell you how comforting it was for us both to read the posts, and get the phone calls, text messages, flowers, etc. You are some wonderful people! Take Care.  TerryO",
