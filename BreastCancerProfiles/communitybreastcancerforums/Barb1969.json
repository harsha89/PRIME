What can I expect to happen at the visit? Will they order blood work, etc.? Also I broke out in hives 2 days ago only on my abdomen, breast neck, underarms, and arms for the first time ever in my life, I am not allergic to anything. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? BarbÂ  Log in to post a reply",
