I feel confident it's the right decision, but some days the enormity of it all kind of hits me in the face. 2 weeks and 2 days to go and although I'm not looking forward to it, I just want May 31 to get here already. So many emotions. ",

Drains were removed at 7 days post-op so I know I was lucky there since so many of you have had to endure even longer. I am not sure if it was because the drains were removed sooner rather than later (fluid was mostly clear and less than 30cc in 24 hours), but I feel like there is A LOT of inflammation. I have TE's (I am very petite so I requested they use smaller ones) and they feel so full and hard. Much fuller than they looked when I peeked the day after surgery. Then, they looked deflated and kinda flat. Now they're full and I'm almost bigger than I was pre-surgery. In fairness, I was barely an A so that wouldn't take much. But I'm wondering how much swelling everyone else is noticing? I took a short and slow walk down the block and back, but it brought on intense pain on one side and I think swelling. Has anyone found a balance between activity and rest? I feel like some movement is good, but then it seems to lead to more swelling. Or maybe I'm imagining it all. I just don't know my body right now like I did 11 days previously :( I did a nipple sparing BMX and one side looks completely flat, like it was painted on. The other side almost comes to a point. Is this also due to inflammation? Has anyone had the shape change as swelling changes. It's a whole new world, isn't it? Thanks in advance for any help! ",

But as my surgery didn't even begin until 4pm (I actually asked the PS if he needed a shot of espresso before he started), my husband wanted to be there when I woke up and was settled in my room. A friend who had a BMX last year told me that her mom spent that first night with her. It got me thinking and at the last minute, I thought how nice it would be to look over and have him there, so I asked him to stay. He was very happy for me to finally admit that I needed some help. As it turned out, anesthesia and I are not friends and I relied on him to hold my hair back multiple times during the night. If you have someone who can be there with you, it's just a good feeling to know you're not alone.",

It's been a week and 2 days and although the bulk of the physical pain is definitely tolerable, the emotional toll of the last few months is starting to weigh heavily. I have NO second thoughts about my decision to have surgery (I lost my dad to cancer and would do anything, ANYTHING, to keep my daughters from experiencing the same thing) but when I think that I had cancer (still waiting on final pathology so it's not officially past tense, but my surgeon feels pretty confident) and now look in the mirror to see drain holes and bruises and stitches and bizarre looking TE's, its almost too much. I don't even feel modest about someone seeing my chest. Is that because so many doctors, nurses, techs, etc have seen and touched me in the last few months? Or because my breasts are officially gone and replaced by these fakes? I have a great support system in my friends and family, but this is hard. I am strong when I'm with people, but alone I crack. I want to feel like myself again and just wonder if anyone is feeling this way and can share any insight as to when normalcy or a new normalcy will set in?",
