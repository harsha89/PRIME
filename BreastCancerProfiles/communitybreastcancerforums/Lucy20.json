The first cycle wasn't so bad just a few harsh headache controlled with x-tylenol...first three days I was very tired but by the 4th day I went out for a 3 mile walk and moved up to a 6.25 walk/jog by the 10th & 11th day of the first cycle.  Today I noticed the bed of my nails were changing to a dark purple...scared that it will hurt if I start to lose my nails...work on a computer all day so...yikes   I start Cycle 2 on Wednesday 04/10...preparing myself that it may not be as easy as the first...crossing my fingers  Veda ",
