Unfortunately the radiologist read my repeat mammo as a fibroadenoma and sent me home assuring me I was fine and didn't need to return for a year. When I had my annual checkup in February my PCP seemed comfortable with the diagnosis. Over the summer the lump got bigger and I finally went to my PCP to demand answers and/or treatment options and she sent me back for testing. I got the BC dx on my kids' first day of school. On the initial ultrasound my tumor measured at 4-5 cm. but my MO, BS and I all agree that by the time I started neoadjuvant chemo a couple of weeks later it was at least 6 cm.. I just finished my last chemo (4 AC + 4 Taxol) two days ago (yeah!) and the tumor is definitely smaller and further from the skin than it was so my chances of getting off with a lumpectomy have improved considerably.",

The question I forgot to ask was, does the infusion need to be done before the next round of chemo or can it be done post-chemo? IOW, would the need for an infusion delay my next treatment or could we keep on schedule? (My center does bookwork and chemo on the same day.) Anyone have experience with this? ",
