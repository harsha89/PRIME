I had a CT as opposed to an MRI, but it showed a second tumour (in the opposite breast) which had been missed on the mammogram. So obviously that changed the treatment plan. This is the toughest part...the waiting for tests and results, waiting to talk to the oncologist, etc. I am through all that and feel relieved that there is now a plan but it took 2 months. I start chemo this week. Good luck telling the kids. My kids are grown and out of the house...but it wasn't easy telling them...especially since this is my second bout of cancer (colon cancer in 2013) and I am not THAT old...only 52. Let us know how you are doing! We are all in this together. Andrea",

My lymphedema didn't appear until after my rads. I only had rads on the left side - that was where I had lymph node involvement. (The RO had wanted to do both sides but couldn't figure out a way to do it without overdosing me on radiation in the central chest region). Anyhow, the lymphedema is mild...I noticed it myself (I am an RN and knew what to look for). I eventually had lymphatic massage then was fitted for a glove and sleeve. I was told to wear them all the time during the day, but sometimes that is just not practical. I wear them a lot anyway. Re BP readings...I get my BP done on the right side. Although more lymph nodes were taken from that side, there is no lymphedema since I did not have radiation on that side. Rads can really destroy those nodes, as I have discovered! El Tigre, I have some tricep pain on the right side (my unaffected side). I think it may just be lingering effects of chemo, or maybe referred pain from the initial surgery. It is better since I started working out at the gym. Andrea ",

With the chemo, it started coming out day 12 after TC#1. I would get tons of it on my hairbrush, and in the shower it came out in fistfuls.

It's a formula my oncologist made up so it's not covered by my medical plan but it wasn't that expensive. I have heard it's great. My mouth sores aren't terribly painful but they are annoying. So maybe the mouthwash will make them feel less annoying. I have a chemo buddy who has inflammatory BC - her chances of survival are 50/50. I feel so fortunate - even though I had bilateral BC and one of my tumours was triple negative, it was caught early. I have lymph node involvement but it's the other side - where the tumour was ER and PR positive...so should respond well to treatment. So my chances are more like 90%.

I am going to ask her if she wants to come to my last chemo next month but won't be surprised if she says no. Husbands can be impossible too. If I may be allowed to vent a little myself...for the last week DH has been pretty absent. He works in Victoria, over an hours' drive away (he commutes by bus every day). It is a long day for him...he decided to stay at his mom's place there to give himself a break for the week (she was away on vacation). So that was fine, I was on my own all week - except Friday, which was a day off for him. Then we were invited to friends' place on Friday...I had chemo Thurs. so was not up to going, but he went anyway. Then last night...same thing, we were invited to another friend's birthday party...I was not up to going but he went. It was in Victoria and he stayed overnight again because his mom got home from her vacation and he wanted to greet her. Tonight another friend invited us out to dinner with her...I am opting out again because I feel crappy but DH will probably go The problem is that he is very social and has tons of friends...I have a lot of friends too but with chemo etc. can't be nearly as busy as him. So I stay at home while he has fun. He does not seem to think there is anything wrong with this. Oh, and 99% of his friends are female. I trust him and he's known his friends forever, but I can't help but feel a little discarded. Here I am, feeling like an ugly alien and he's out enjoying life. I know this is not forever and I can't expect him to sit around and hold my hand...but it's difficult. Okay, end of rant. Andrea",

Re fevers... three days after the first round of chemo I developed a temp of 38.1 Celsius (I'm in Canada) - was told by the chemo nurse to go to ER for anything above 38. I think that's 100F. Anyway, I did go and it turned out okay - I had the start of a cold but had given myself my Neulasta shot and it was doing its job - my WBC count was up so my body was fighting the infection. Second round of chemo I was okay but this round I also developed a temp of 38 which persisted for 3 days. This time I did not go to the ER though, although I'm sure the oncology nurses would scold me for that. The temp went away on its own. If it had been higher I would have gone in for sure. Re parents: my father passed away 4 1/2 years ago and I really miss him. I would give anything to have him here with me. He died of cancer as well (melanoma) and I think about that all the time. He was 75. I can only hope to live longer than he did! I'm doing my best, anyway. I am really grateful to have my mom still though, and she is healthy. She is coming to my last chemo with me on July 2 :) I'm feeling better all the time - 7 days post TC#3. It's amazing just how fatigued the chemo makes you feel...I can do housework etc. in little spurts but then have to lie down because I'm light headed, sweaty, short of breath, and feel like I'm going to pass out. But this should only last another couple of days. I totally understand about feeling guilty about accepting help. I have a friend who is coming over next week to do some gardening for me - I tried to tell her no but she was most insistent. I am so lucky to have such great people in my life! Andrea ",

I hope your treatment is successful. Littleblue, I am TN as well - on the right side. No lymph node involvement though. Radiation is recommended for all TN's. My left tumour was ER and PR positive but there was lymph node involvement there so I get to have that side radiated as well. I figure I'll throw everything they've got at this cancer. The RO is doing a \"kinder, gentler\" radiation on me because I want reconstruction. So it's 28 sessions rather than the standard 16. ksusan: re nails...I am on TC as well and have had no nail issues at all. Do you get ice to your hands and feet while you're getting the taxotere? Re fresh produce etc. - I was never told (except on here) about washing fruits and veggies thoroughly but I always have anyway. And I was never told to avoid pot lucks and buffets although I haven't felt much like socializing so that is kind of a non-issue. I really am not all that worried about germs, the Neulasta seems to be doing its job...my WBC's are always good. I haven't been having as many visits with the grandkids though because they have colds half the time. Andrea ",

Kbeee...re co-pay - it is a totally foreign concept to me. In Canada our health care is free...well, we do pay for it but it's on a sliding scale so if someone can't afford it it is free. For those of us working stiffs, it's taken off our pay but it's inexpensive and we don't even notice it. It is actually illegal in Canada to be without health insurance, and there is no reason to not have it. But I don't want to get into a political discussion. Suffice to say that it's nice going to hospitals and doctor's offices without ever worrying about bills. We have been having such a hot dry spring/summer and there are forest fires all over. Our sky has gone from brilliant blue to orange/grey thanks to the smoke. The fires aren't anywhere near us but there is a huge smoke cloud hovering over southern Vancouver Island. However...I am off to a big music festival up island on Wednesday. My husband is coordinating the volunteer performer shuttle this year. We both volunteer at it every year, but this year I'm opting out due to chemo. But as a coordinator he gets a ticket for me including a backstage pass! Lyle Lovett, Buddy Guy, and Graham Nash are the headliners. Looking forward to it! We are camping on site so if I get tired I can go lie down in the van. Have a great week everyone Andrea ",

Once I get hair again and colour it, maybe I will look younger again but I will never look as I did pre-chemo. My profile pic was taken just under 2 years ago - I had colon cancer at the time but didn't know it yet. Feeling good today. Tomorrow I see my RO and then have the CT mapping to prepare for rads.

I am the middle child...older brother, younger sister. Grew up in Victoria BC - daughter of a teacher. When I was 14 my dad got a job teaching Army brats in Germany so we moved there for three years. We took advantage of it and travelled every chance we could get, all over Europe. It was amazing! I graduated from grade 12 once we were back in Canada, worked for a year in the office of a stockbrokerage then moved up-island to Nanaimo to live with (and subsequently marry) my boyfriend. We had two kids together but a miserable marriage...we divorced after 13 years. By this time I was a nursing student, halfway through my program. I met and married my soulmate Ian about 4 years later. He's so kind and understanding...exactly opposite of hubby #1! Anyway, my kids are now 32 and almost 29. My daughter Christina (also a nurse) has a 2 1/2 year old son and 5 month old daughter...the grandkids are absolutely the best things in my life! My son James lives in Ottawa - all the way across the country so I don't see him much. But he is doing well, has a good job with IBM and is happy. I graduated from nursing school in 1997 and since 1998 have been working at a small community hospital in Duncan BC, where we moved 10 years ago. I have been working in ICU for the last 9 years, although I am on medical leave now. I was anemic for a few years and it was getting worse when I had a FIT (fecal immunochemical test) in fall of 2013. It was positive...so I had a colonoscopy which showed a tumour. On Dec. 5, 2013 I had a left hemicolectomy followed by 6 months of chemo. The cancer had not spread and I was deemed to be cancer-free. Early December of 2014 I had a screening mammogram. I had not had one for 7 years..too busy...so I said. But I felt that I was low risk because I do not have a family history. Well, they saw something in my left breast so I went back for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, then a biopsy on New Year's Eve, I found out about a week later that it was cancer. I was going to have a lumpectomy and radiation but had a screening CT, at which another tumour was detected in the right breast. I could actually feel that one. It had been missed on the mammogram. So...the plan changed and I underwent a BMX on March 26 and am now on chemo - four cycles of TC - and will have radiation once this is over. I have lymph node involvement which is a bit scary, but only on the left side which was ER and PR positive. The tumour on the right was triple negative, which would have been bad if it had spread to the lymph nodes but it did not! It's very weird having had bilateral breast cancer - diagnosed at the same time but two different types of tumour. Neither has any relation to the colon cancer either. I am having a genetic counselling appointment in a year or so. That's about it...sorry it's so wordy! Andrea",

I have clinical depression and an anxiety disorder and it has absolutely changed my life. I tried for years to get by without drugs for my depression but I was so miserable.

Momma, sweet picture of your daughter! positive spirit, love your photos! Re working during treatments...it is, of course, a personal decision...but for me I can't imagine working. My job right now is to look after myself and get better. Mind you, as a nurse my job involves 12 hour shifts and can be mentally as well as physically demanding. I have been told by my MO not to expect to return to work until at least Feb. of next year. I will have been off work a year. I have been reading about people's experiences with PA's - I live in Canada and we don't have them (at least, not where I live). But I was in Phoenix earlier this year and had to take my mom to ER and she was seen by a PA there. Not once was she assessed by a doctor. The PA kept leaving the room to go ask the doctor questions or run things by him. The doctor wrote my mom a prescription without ever seeing her. And this hospital is supposed to be one of the top hospitals in the country. It seems like a really backwards system to me. I am feeling pretty much 100% now, nine days after TC#2. It's a good thing too, because my husband has planned a big backyard BBQ today for my birthday! (My birthday is actually Tuesday). The weather is gorgeous and I am so glad to be alive! Can't wait to see the grandchildren today! Andrea",

Pegsurri - I too had a BMX. It was really not that bad...going through chemo is worse. The most important thing is to do your exercises religiously! You do not want to lose any mobility. I did not shower for two weeks...just had sponge baths and my daughter came over and washed my hair for me at the kitchen sink. You will not be able to raise your arms above your head for a while. I had four drains - I wore loose button-up tops and pinned the drains inside my tops. I still felt pretty bulky but people really did not notice. I did go out for short periods but did not drive till my BS okayed it (after two weeks). Re pain - again, not bad in my case. If I moved the wrong way I would have a lot of pain but otherwise it was quite tolerable. Sleeping was okay, as long as I had pillows under both arms and took a pain pill before going to bed. Good luck to you! All is well with me. My radiation has been postponed twice now...it was supposed to start July 28, then Aug. 4...now it's Aug. 14. They \"need more time for planning\". I think it may be because I had bilateral BC so will be getting radiation on both sides. But the RO has known this for weeks so I don't get the delay. But I would rather have things well planned than rush into something that may not be in my best interest. In the meantime, I am feeling much more energetic since I finished chemo and am enjoying the summer! Andrea ",

Re the cost of cancer treatment...in countries such as mine with socialized medicine, there is no deductible and the cost of hospitalization, procedures etc. is covered. The only thing that may not be covered is medication. We have programs for people who do not have extended medical insurance which does cover the cost of many (but not all) medications. I have extended medical coverage through my work and have only had to pay once for a medication - ondansetron (Zofran) - because my oncologist messed up and did not fill out a form to get the cost waived. Even the cost of the Neulasta was totally covered ($2500 per injection). Thank goodness for insurance! It is actually illegal to be without basic medical insurance in British Columbia. Gingeel, my last chemo was by far the worst. I was sick for a couple of weeks afterwards, with diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, fevers etc. I ended up in hospital with a very low potassium level. So glad I only had to have four cycles! Rads are a breeze compared to that. Re depression post treatment - it is a very real thing, I went through that a little last year after chemo for my colon cancer. I called it \"doctor withdrawal\" but it was really lack of attention. I had been so used to doctor appointments every three weeks for six months. I felt cast adrift when it was all over! I did feel better after my colonoscopy in November which was clear. My rads are going well...only a couple of weeks to go! My skin is a bit pink and my underarm is sore and chafed but aside from that, all is well. hope you are all having a good weekend! Andrea  ",

Aveeno was mentioned...I can't remember what else offhand. It said to use it at least twice a day - I am aiming for three. And to apply generously. It is also important to keep covered in the sun...ie, if you are having rads to the supraclavicular area, wear a scarf to cover it in the sun. Washing with a mild soap is important too (Ivory, Dove). My mom has been driving me to my rads appointments. My dad died of melanoma 4 1/2 years ago...I asked her today if it brings back bad memories, coming to the cancer clinic every day like she did with my dad. She said no, that it was just something she had to take care of. She did say that she never imagined she would be driving her daughter there. I hope it's the last family member she will have to do this for! Hopefully I will be driving myself soon. My headaches are pretty much gone but the leg weakness and dizziness episodes persist.

Re hair - mine is coming back dark on the top, white on the sides...hmm. I have some very fine facial hair but unless you shove your face right up to mine you won't notice it. I can't believe I am actually finished treatment. My skin has to heal, that's all that's on the agenda. Plus future MO and RO appointments. Thank you all for helping me go through this, your support and advice meant so much! Andrea ",

Hopefully your belly drain(s) will come out soon. Beautiful pics Lynne! DH and I were in New England a couple of years ago in the fall, it was so gorgeous! On the west coast we don't usually get colours that vivid, but this year is an exception because we have had way more sun than usual. I have a date for my hysterectomy & oophrectomy - Nov. 19. The surgery itself shouldn't be too bad, only a one night stay in hospital provided there are no complications. It will be another six week recovery but all that means is no heavy lifting/housework. Not a problem, I don't do much of that anyway - haha! Your hair looks very funky, Lynne! I'm waiting till my hair gets a bit longer before colouring it. I do want to colour it, I look so old compared to DH! I'm curious to see what it looks like without colour though so I'll wait. I'm having hip pain - I don't know if it's from chemo or tamoxifen (which I just stopped in preparation for surgery), or if it's a side-effect of my new antidepressant. At any rate, it is quite painful at times - if I'm sitting still it's fine, but getting up or down is often a bit of a struggle. I'll have to see the doc for a preop visit soon and will see what she thinks. My elbows and shoulders hurt sometimes too. Maybe I'm just getting old. Andrea  ",

I also had 3 colds in the 6 months I was on chemo last year. For three of those months I was back to work in a germy hospital though. Almost as bad as having little kids at home! Re watery eyes - they have been a problem for me since last year when I was on chemo for colon cancer and it has continued ever since. My MO tells me it's a side effect of chemo and will go away eventually but could take months.

Not feeling terrific right now because I have a nasty cold. Bah. I picked up my tamoxifen today so I will be starting on that. I won't \"see\" my MO now till December - I will have a telehealth conference with him. Because I live in a small town, I will go to the local hospital and (I think) talk to him via a video link. That worries me a bit...what if I have a lump or something? I guess I would see my family doc and have her do an exam. Of course, I don't expect that to happen...

She'd had stage one, treated with surgery and chemo...then a couple of years later was diagnosed with stage 4. She fought valiantly...more chemo and some radiation...died anyway. Then a bunch of people posted similar stories. So now I'm sitting here, having battled stage two with lymph node involvement...surgery, chemo and rads...will my cancer return?

Pain wise you will be uncomfortable for 2-3 days but it's not bad. You will have to take it easy for a while - ie, no heavy lifting or housework for 6 weeks. All in all though I was surprised at how quickly I recovered. Andrea ",

My RO has had long discussions with me about not getting pregnant. Ummm...for one thing, I am 53 and a grandma...for another, I have an IUD...for another, NO FRICKIN' WAY. Littleblue, lucky you! My rad techs are all female. Which is fine with me. Week one of radiation finished! No SE's yet but it's way early. 5 down, 23 to go. I was told that I won't need any boosts so there will definitely be no more than 28 treatments. So DH and I have booked a flight to Ottawa to see DS at the end of September. I can't wait! Yesterday we took our grandson Peter (almost 3) to the fair. He's pretty young and was rather freaked out by everything but it was nice spending time with him. I love being called Grandma. It's funny though, sometimes he calls DH \"Grandpa\" and sometimes he calls him by his first name, Ian. Ian is his step-grandpa and I think that kids instinctively can tell who is related by blood and who isn't. Not feeling 100 percent today - headachy again but not those crushing headaches like before. I think my body is just rebelling against all I have been putting it through. Taking it easy today. It's good to be home. It has been nice spending time with my mom during radiation but her icky boyfriend is around a lot...thank goodness I am home on weekends Andrea  ",

I am so glad you all were on the ride with me, it made things so much easier. I am not a \"support group\" type of gal but this online thing has been a godsend. Things are going great with me - I just took out a one month membership at the local rec centre - unlimited use of the pool and gym, sauna, whirlpool etc. There is an Aqua Therapy class there three times a week, for people recovering from serious illness or surgery - I have gone to that a couple of times. It's been fun, and it's so great that I actually have the energy to do it. I will continue with membership but am not doing it for April since we'll be away in Portugal for three weeks. I also babysat the grandkids three times this week - well, just the baby twice and both kids yesterday. That was tiring! But not as bad as it used to be. I spent years being anemic and tired all the time, it feels so good to feel\"normal\"! Cheers, Andrea 😀 ",

Jackbirdie, I love the cancer card! I play it at every opportunity. People tell me it's getting old, but I reply that there has to be some concessions to going through all this. Lynne, my RO has never said anything about cornstarch...she just talks about moisturizing. I do have a bottle of baby powder which contains cornstarch and have used it a few times under my arm where it's quite sore...but the area needs moisture too so if I add lotion as well I end up with paste. So I am trying not to use the powder unless I wash it off before applying lotion. Re the little film I was in - apparently it will be on YouTube or something like that \"soon\". I will let you all know when it is. So I am nearing the home stretch - only 5 more rads to go! I had a bit of a meltdown today when I saw the RO. I didn't intend to, but I told her about my headaches and started crying and couldn't stop. I think everything is just hitting me all at once. I have been strong up till now but honestly, I don't know how much a person is supposed to take. Colon cancer followed by surgery and chemo, then bilateral breast cancer followed by double mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Then excruciating migraines, followed by near constant tension headaches. All this within the space of two years. I am also getting anxious about finishing treatment...I see my MO on Tuesday but then I will be cut loose and on my own without the safety net of the cancer clinic. I know I will be followed closely from here on, but it's still scary. And my Ativan is at home (I'm at my mom's). I have one that the RO gave me to take tonight though.

I think it's ridiculous. You all get it. And I can vent no matter the time of day...like now, 3:30 am - when insomnia hits. Anyway, I value you all and wish you nothing but future health and happiness 💜 Andrea ",

I was so sore from cooking, chasing them around etc. Not used to doing so much! It was so great to have them here though! Tomorrow is DH's staff Christmas party in Victoria so we'll stay overnight with his mom. Speaking of moms, it looks like my mom has dumped her alcoholic married boyfriend for good this time! Yay!

They were covered by my medical plan, which is good because they cost $500 each! Wow. Then there are bras. I have three...one was covered by my plan, I paid for one and the third one was thrown in for free. I wear the prostheses out but don't bother if I'm not taking my coat off - ie, grocery shopping. I know, I worry too much about my appearance but I have a big tummy and it looks funny with no boobs. Re wearing pins etc. - I have one BC t-shirt but have only worn it a couple of times...don't really want to advertise. A couple of friends gave me one of those necklaces you can put charms inside of...two of the charms are BC ones and I do wear them, but they are tiny. I am open about it though...everyone knows about it and that is fine. I look at it as an opportunity to educate when I am asked questions. People really are interested.

It irritates me enormously when I hear of doctors saying \"you're too young\"...as an RN I have seen far too many young people with cancer, heart disease, etc. Littleblue, I won't consider myself cancer free until five years after treatment. I am ultra cautious because I have lymph node involvement, plus I have had three cancers in less than two years. So far all my scans have been negative (PET, CT's) and my tumour markers are normal, but I can't help being a little paranoid about recurrence. Congrats Lynne!!! Re post treatment celebrations - DH and I are travel fanatics and I am wracking my brain trying to think of someplace to go once all this is over. One thing we will do for sure is go visit my son in Quebec in Late Sept./early Oct. He bought himself a house 1 1/2 years ago and we still haven't seen it. And of course we want to see him - he is just so far away! But I also want to go to Alaska, to Paris, to Bermuda, to Cuba...there are so many places! There are three different groups of people who want to go to Las Vegas with us too. We got back from the Okanagan Valley yesterday. The friends we stayed with live in an orchard and gave us a bunch of beautiful cherries, and we picked up a flat of blueberries at a fruit stand. My plan for today is to make jam! So nice that I am through chemo and have some energy. Andrea  ",

The dressing needs to be changed once a week - home care does it on my off chemo weeks. Although yesterday the chemo nurse told me that mine should be changed twice a week because it's been very warm here and I am sweaty and get heat rashes and react to the adhesive. So now I will be having it changed Mondays and Thursdays. I can hardly feel the line - the day of chemo the insertion site aches a bit but it's not bad. The rest of the time I barely notice it. The big drawback is that you can't submerse it in water, and it needs to be wrapped in Saran Wrap or an open ended bag to shower. And no swimming for me till after it comes out in July (and I get swimming breast forms and a mastectomy bathing suit!) Andrea",

I hope you find an excellent plastic surgeon who listens to you and explains the options in detail. With me there was never an option. I want breasts. They were always my best feature, if I do so myself. And my hair, which will grow back...unfortunately boobs don't do that. The way I see it, cancer took a lot from me - part of my colon, my appendix, my breasts, my uterus, my ovaries...not to mention the hair thing. Then there's the sense of security about my health - I had always been healthy and this was a real shock. I think we all have a degree of PTSD. And it robbed me of the job I love - temporarily, but if I could I would sue cancer for compensatory damages. Can you tell I'm angry?  Anyhow, onto a happier topic. I saw my family doctor today and I have to say, I absolutely love her. She gives me whatever I want. She did a physical exam and found that my right axillary area is larger than the left so she is sending me for a chest wall and axilla ultrasound. And I complained of pain I am having in my left thumb - the joint where it joins the hand is very sore, especially in the morning. I think it may be some arthritis but she's going to x-ray it just to be sure. And she's sending me for bloodwork - my oncologist just kind of left me high and dry although he did tell me to follow up with my GP so I guess he expected her to set up the bloodwork. I'm to have it every three months for two years. She also gave me a prescription for compression sleeve and glove for my left arm - I am to be fitted on Wednesday. Sometimes I think I am a bit of a hypochondriac, but I think I have earned the right to be after three cancers. She doesn't seem to mind though. Have a great week everyone! Andrea     ",

Good news...the MRI of my brain is Sunday and I will for sure start rads on Monday! Rads had been postponed because my RO was having difficulty coming up with a feasible plan for bilateral rads...she had rejected about 15 of them.

Re rads: I saw the RO last week (between TC 2 and 3). Radiation is to begin 4 weeks after the date of my last chemo infusion (July 2)...so it should start early August. I will have 28 sessions, approx. 6 weeks - because they want to be gentle on my skin since I want reconstruction. I have to have radiation on both sides since I had bilateral BC. I still am having trouble coming to terms with being bald, too. I avoid mirrors and still lean over the tub to dry off, even though I don't have to. I haven't wrapped my head in a towel though. Re sex: I am totally uninterested. I don't think we've done it since I started chemo. My hubby is okay with it. At least, I think he is! It is strange where you lose hair and where you don't. I have lost almost all my \"nether region\" hair, which is kind of cool...and my underarm and leg hair. But I still have eyebrows and eyelashes, although I think my eyelashes are thinner. Re depression: I have clinical depression and have been on Paxil a few years. It has changed my life - without it I do not think I could go through all this.

It is sweetened with aspartame though so I don't drink gallons of it. Re weight: I have been gaining, and I was overweight to begin with so now I feel like a big ol' whale. When I say to my doctors that I should try to lose weight the response is always \"that is the least of your worries right now\". I am loving the humour here! Some of you crack me up! Today I started on dex and I have my blood work. Tomorrow is TC#3 - ugh. Not looking forward to chemo fog and fatigue. My mantra during all this is \"This too shall pass\"...

It has been eventful, to say the least. I had my 4th and final TC on July 3rd. Normally the SE's last about a week then I am fine. So I came to the music festival on day 5 (a couple of days early...my husband is a coordinator), thinking I would be fine on Friday. Not so. I was still feeling weak, nauseated, short of breath, had diarrhea and that night developed a high fever (102.5). So off to the hospital I went. My white count was fine thanks to the Neulasta but I had a chest X-ray, gave a urine sample and they took lots of blood. My potassium level came back really low...2.7 (should be at least 3.5). So I stayed overnight while I got IV and oral potassium, plus Tylenol and an antibiotic. My potassium level was rechecked in the morning...still a bit low but I was allowed to go home after drinking some more vile potassium liquid. I am to return to the hospital today to have my potassium rechecked. I have been taking the antibiotics twice a day too, and no more fever. All this while camping in a van in a field. Luckily we have friends in town so I stayed indoors on Saturday, napping and reading. Good thing too, because that day, after a two month drought, the skies opened and it started pouring! I did go back to the music fest that evening to see Buddy Guy...in the rain, but our friend had a small shelter tent thing we were under. Great show! Anyway, we leave town today and go home! After checking in at the hospital, of course. Does anyone else get unexplained fevers with their chemo? They can never find a source of infection and this has happened with 3 of my 4 cycles. Andrea",

This here is my only support group - I don't feel I need anything else. My family doctor though wants me to see a psychologist for my depression. I was doing great on Paxil, which I had taken for years...but then she switched me to Celexa because Paxil interacts with Tamoxifen. But Celexa is just not doing the job...so now I'm weaning off the Celexa and will start Effexor next week. Hopefully that will do the trick. It's tough enough going through this cancer crap and three surgeries in two years, without adding depression to the mix. I'm doing okay though. Just not as positive as I was before, and I'm not sleeping very well. But then again, I'm having my hysterectomy and oophrectomy on the 19th so I am probably subconsciously stressed about it, though I don't feel terribly anxious. Re hot flashes...I was getting them pre BC diagnosis although I was still getting my periods. But I wasn't having \"flashes\", I felt hot all the time. I think I had a much lower tolerance to heat than I used to. With any exertion I would have to sit by a fan for a while to cool off. That is still the case to some degree, although it's not nearly as unbearable now. Then again, our long hot summer is over! Andrea",

I think actually I joined in April - my first chemo was April 30 - so I haven't known you all quite a year. But what a year it has been. Scarlett, the only supplements I take daily are Vitamin D (we don't get enough sunlight here in the wintertime, plus it is good for cardiac health and is supposed to prevent cancers); and Omega-3, which was recommended for me by my optometrist to prevent watery eyes and it works! I don't eat enough fish too...so will continue with it. Lynne, so sorry to hear about your friends who are having health issues. What would I do differently, knowing what I know now...? I would allow myself to rest more. I have a bad habit of not wanting people to worry about me, so I pretend things are okay when they're really not. I did not nap enough during chemo/radiation. I only asked for help a few times, to drive me to appointments when I was in a chemo fog...but other than that I managed by myself during the week when my hubby was at work. I did not want to bother people - which I know is silly, people want to help. Even though I knew that, I didn't let myself be helped very much. As for my treatment, I would have questioned things more. For starters, my initial mammogram was scheduled for September of 2014...the mammography dept. of the hospital phoned me that day to say they had to cancel me because the ONE mammography tech was sick! I was dumbfounded. Not only that, but I would have to call the screening mammography program to reschedule. The next available appointment was in three months. So I didn't have it till early December, then a followup one and ultrasound a week later and my biopsy Dec. 31. My family doctor was quite dismayed that I had to wait so long for the biopsy. I was dismayed that cancer was not caught three months earlier, as it should have been. I am too quiet, I really should make more noise about things...but I don't want to be bitchy either. Oh...one thing happened today that really bugs me. I was in the change room at our pool and a little girl (aged 4-5) pointed at me and said \"She looks funny\". I don't know if it was because of my lack of boobs (I had my shirt on by this time) or the fact that my wet hair was sticking up. Her babysitter reprimanded her and she started to cry, and I reassured her that it was okay, my grandson thinks the same thing. But it still stung. Kids say things that adults have the social filter to keep quiet. *sigh* On the up side, it's a beautiful day here in the Pacific Northwest! Spring is here...  Andrea ",

They aren't too bad but I can feel them there all the time and there are new ones every day. I haven't been very diligent about the baking soda but will start using it more often. I ordered wigs yesterday (3!) and have my breast prostheses. Fake boobs, fake hair...thanks cancer! My hubby and I had a very busy Mother's Day weekend of visiting but it was terrific!

At that point it was really sparse and I looked like a sick old woman. I definitely like the Telly Savalas look better! I never had any scalp sensitivity. One advantage to going bald now is that it's cooler for the summer. I do have wigs and wear them out but they are hot. I think I may invest in some pretty scarves and learn how to tie them properly. Sorry about the blood clots...way to go, giving yourself the shots! I am an RN so have given lots of needles, and I give myself the Neulasta...but it is different when you are doing it to yourself!

Same goes for you Addie, I am sure that your reconstruction will be great. I want reconstruction but was not given the option at the time of surgery. My surgeon said \"in two years\". Not sure why...maybe because I had bilateral breast cancer? Or because after chemo I am having radiation? I am feeling better today - wow, it is amazing just how much life chemo sucks out of you!

In fact, I got my GP to order an MRI of my leg because there was a bump there. It turned out to be varicose veins. Haha! I had a dream last night that I had hair. Long hair, and I was washing it and it felt so good! Except I worried that I didn't rinse it well enough. Funny... A friend gave me a wig yesterday. That brings the grand total to five!

I've been anemic most of my adult life...at times I have been on iron supplements (I am right now) or have had iron infusions. I have never had a blood transfusion though...my hemoglobin is never quite low enough. I am thinking that once I fully recover from chemo and since I don't have my periods anymore, my hemoglobin will come up. Yay Ginger! Congrats! Awww gkodad, I know how much you want rads to be over. It sucks that you have to wait even longer. Hugs! I am feeling well, just tired. My skin is getting way better, old stuff peeling off and nice pink skin underneath. Very little pain now. Yay!

Is that a chemo side effect, or a result of forced menopause or what? Kbeee, there are a few antidepressants which don't interact with tamoxifen. My GP switched me from Paxil to Celexa. I don't work out - I probably should though - but I have been achy since chemo, on and off. My hip joints are particularly sore. I think yoga or something would probably help. Can't hurt, anyway.

Well, as long as I make people laugh. Dizz, when is your ultrasound? I am having one on Friday. I got the results of my bloodwork...everything is perfect! My tumour markers are negative...big relief. If the ultrasound and MRI (next month) are normal I can stop worrying about recurrence. For a while, anyway. I am glad I am having all the tests, if only for peace of mind. Tomorrow I am going with my daughter and granddaughter to Vancouver for a few days! She is attending a conference for work and is taking baby Kate because she is still nursing at night.

But I make it very clear that I don't know a lot about oncology and need teaching etc. I actually really like being treated there because everyone is so nice! I had a BMX March 26 this year and my nurses (former co-workers and friends) moved heaven and earth to get me a private room. They ended up converting the patient lounge into a private room for me and I was extremely grateful. I think that the only thing I would be uncomfortable with having co-workers do would be catheterize me etc. I had a catheter just once, when I had colon cancer 18 months ago - I came out of the OR with one because I had an epidural etc. I never asked who inserted it because I really did not want to know! I don't know a lot of the OR staff very well anyway! I did have nurses I know give me a bedbath - but I was so out of it on drugs I barely remember that!",

I had colon cancer with a hemicolectomy in Dec. 2013, followed by 6 months of chemo. I went back to work halfway through my chemo because I felt pretty good...the chemo was oral (capacetibine). But when I went back I went casual, so that I could pick and choose shifts and I worked hardly any nights. I figured that would be better for my health and prevent any more cancer. Right? WRONG! I had a screening mammogram in early Dec. - sure enough, tumour was detected in my left breast. During a screening CT a second tumour was discovered in my right breast...so I am scheduled for a BMX in (gulp!) nine days - March 26. Since my hospital is small, our oncologist also works as a general internist and is on-call often in the ICU, so I know him well. In fact, he is a neighbour! I know my surgeon well also, and most of the nursing staff. With my colon cancer I did not mind at all being a patient there. Everyone treats staff really well. While I am not thrilled with this latest diagnosis, I am glad to be in the hands of such knowledgeable, caring people. I am going to be off work at least 9 months because I will need intense chemo and radiation, and I will miss work. But I will still be going there for treatments, so I will see my work friends anyway! I will miss the patients though, and that feeling you get when you make a positive difference in someone's life.
