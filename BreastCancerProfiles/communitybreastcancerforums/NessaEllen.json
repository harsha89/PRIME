I was dxed with a reoccurrence, and chemo again. After the third reoccurrence, because it hadn't metastasized since my diagnosis, I was able to have my breasts removed. An aside, I LOVE being flat (well flatish, I had large breasts and chubby so I toats have little dog ears) the drains though, ugh. The second one they pulled out I legitimately had a panic attack, like I couldn't breathe and everything went dark and swirly. The last two, a different day, and a different nurse got them :) she was so gentle that it wasn't a problem at all. My latest reoccurrence is in my right side, my lymph nodes. Right beforehand, I was complaining of headaches and not normal headaches, these did not stop, just a consistent pressure on my head, never went away. My MRI a year ago was clear so they ordered another one. I have a small regular brain tumor on the right frontal lobe, and a HUGE gol ball sized cystic tumor on my cerebellum, near my brain stem. I met with a fantastic surgeon and he gave me about 1-3 months unless I had surgery, but obviously there are risks with brain surgery. I also got a radiologist in this time :) so I had a pretty sizable chunk removed from my cerebellum (a doctors words!) and that was about two months after my bilateral mastectomy ðŸ™€ Recovery from that was pretty painful. I'd say that and my pectus surgery have been the worst. My port was definitely the best ðŸ˜¸ The small tumor on the fright frontal lobe, they're watching. It's too small to measure. I did radiology on the part they cut, to kind of seal it. Now I'm on Kadcyla for the right lymph nodes. I get another pet in a few weeks, and we shall see what's up. So I'm 35 now, diagnosed at 34, and I'm kind of thinking it's cool, how rare I must be! I mean of course there are other people who've had similar procedures but the combination I've had, I bet the percentage is low at my age! That just always makes me giggle Dx 8/18/2015, IDC, Left, 6cm+, Stage IV, metastasized to liver, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I've had medical professionals blow me off before though, and it's a scary feeling. Try to remember that you are paying them, and you have every right to fire them.  I've found it helpful with my confidence talking to friends in the field and getting my list of what I want from the appointment before I walk in.",
