    "Content": "Mar 31, 2018 04:39PM - edited Mar 31, 2018 04:39PM by Gavinsmom5 Kiki1970, I am 34 years old and just completed the reconstruction process after a prophylactic double mastechtomy. I would recommend getting tested first. Color.com has testing that is simple and reasonably priced. I was tested when my sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I was positive for BRCA and decided to have a full hysterectomy and double mastechtomy. I am currently 3 weeks out from my last surgery to complete the process and I have to say that I feel that a huge weight has been lifted. I'm very happy with my decision and would do it all over again if I needed to",
