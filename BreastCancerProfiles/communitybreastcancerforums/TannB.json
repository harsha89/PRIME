He is right about the treatment being the same for men and women. It just happens way more often in woman. We don't have prostates. Do you have a family pedigree of woman and men in your family who have bc? Even though at this time a pedigree won't help you much at this time, it will allow for more knowledge about genetics and how they play a part in the grand scheme of things. What is your doct. suggesting at this time? Have you had a lumpectomy and pathology on the tumor? Please use the online chat. We all want to be there for you. Sometimes we have bad days and need to talk about our dx. and other days it is so hillarious, the laughter get us through the day. You will be surprised at how funny boobs can really be! :-) PLEASE don't try not to isolate yourself and feel alone in this Bullshit diagnosis! It sucks, but we are here for you. We have a lot of info on various dx, tx options, positives, negatives, side effects, successes, not so successes, to share. Sometimes when you go online, it is way too chatty for your mood. just log off and come back when it is quieter and you can get answers. Â I'm sending you cyber hugs. TannB",
