I found a lump in my left breast right before Thanksgiving and noticed a node under my left arm as well. I made an appointment with my doc and could not get in until yesterday due to the Holiday. So,I was seen and doc confirmed a mass in my left breast, node under my arm and he also found nodes in the left side of my neck that are swollen. It does not hurt. I have not been sick. Nothing to explain the nodes that are puffy. Anyways, he ordered alot of lab work, I had that drawn before I left. They are to set up the diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound and he did say I would most likely need biopsies so I'm just waiting on the appointment to go. I had two great aunts who had breast cancer. When I was in my early 20's, I had severe dysplasia of the cervix that was outside the margins, had surgery and my doctor got it all then and it did not reoccur. It may sound completely crazy but I have this sinking feeling that it is not going to be good. It's not a feeling that I can explain other than just a gut feeling. I wish I could detail that feeling but I can't. Any words of wisdom? Thanks!! Log in to post a reply",
