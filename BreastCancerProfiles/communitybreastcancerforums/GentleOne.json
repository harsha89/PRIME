I did talk to manager and she was great. Since this happened over twice at 2 different hospitals (the other time was 3 years ago) I wonder if maybe it's me. Maybe I look like someone who will take it. Either way the results of tests were fine. I have nothing to complain about really! The mammogram tech incidentwas just on my mind this morning because it was upsetting I hope others get good results. I will never forget all you ladies.",

Shoving my body (needlessly hard) and trying to cause me concern and scare me, i.e. clucking and tsk tsk-ing after the first 4 or 5 painful photos, \"These are all bad pictures. I can already tell. SIGH.\" And other manipulative tactics until they can see they're getting me so upset I either cry or blow up. We're already afraid when we go in there! What gives? Is it all the stress in the world?
