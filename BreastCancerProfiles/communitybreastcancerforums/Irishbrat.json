But the good news is that I did receive my accelerated life insurance benefit.  It took me a long time to build up the courage to ask my Onco to sign the paperwork - but she did - like no big deal ..... and in 7 days I had my check!  It has been the best decision that I have made.... So those of you worrying about what others might think - I say go for it if you can!!  Having extra money in the bank has helped relieve so much stress for me... I can now enjoy a few extra special vacations with my kids - I can also put the money away for them, as I choose - they are old enough now (14 and 15), that I am starting to share/discuss with them, the way that I think they should use the money for their futures.  ( I am a single mom) I really hope that everyone that can - really takes advantage of this ..... we deserve some kind of perk with everything else that we are going through!!!
