I have three smaller ones on the same Breast. It is so painful that I can barely stand to touch it. I can barely wear a bra or lay on that side. The pain doesn't subside. I had a biopsy done 9 months ago that confirmed it to be a fibroadenoma. It made me feel better knowing what it was. Recently I started having a brownish color sticky nipple discharge, more pain, and burning. I was worried and went in for my follow up ultrasound. They seemed to not be worried about it and said that everything looks normal. The pain is \"hormonal\". But why is it every day, not just around my period. I can't help but feel like something is wrong. The pain radiates into my breast bone and my left upper part of my back. Could the biopsy be wrong? I can't help but worry. I'm weak, tired, dizzy, I've lost 15 pounds in the past 6 months. I shouldn't feel like this. I feel like I need more answers and I need to speak up since I see other people having pain as well.",
