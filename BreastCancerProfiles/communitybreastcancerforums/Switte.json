The neulasta injection was reduced so only had  a mild reaction to it (flu like for a day or so).  I did experience for the first time in my life kidney stones which were horrible and possibly contributed to the cytoxan although it is not a common side effect.  Ten days after my 2nd treatment, I'm feeling pretty good. My Dr. advised weight bearing exercise and I try to do so as much as possible.  I am still working full time and so far so good.  Third infusion is coming up on 1/18/13 and then only one more to go! ",
