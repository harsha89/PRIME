But it did, and no lymphedema!! I can't explain why there was such a discrepancy in the amount of nodes. I know my BS said she just removes the whole pad of fat and there can be anywhere from 8 to 25 or so nodes. She just sends it to pathology and they actually dig them all out and count them. Do you know if the nodes were all axillary? My tumor was in the outer lower quadrant, and one of my sentinel nodes was an internal mammary node ( near the breastbone). Very unusual that it would drain first to that node. So, maybe not so unusual for yours to drain to the side. Good for you checking your path report. I questioned some things on mine, and the pathologist actually went back and changed what he had written! So sad we have to advocate for ourselves during these trying times!",

What should be the most slow growing, least aggressive cancer. However, after lumpectomy and SNB, I had 2 sentinel nodes positive. One was in the IM chain between the sternum and ribs. The other was an axillary node. My tumor was on the far rt side of the rt breast, yet one of the sentinel nodes was all the way to the center of my chest, and positive!! My BS was able to remove it (the first IM node she'd ever removed). I got unclear margins, and proceeded with a mx and had axillary nodes removed....with one more positive. I couldn't believe my teeny, grade1 tumor had spread like it did. And I had had a mammo every year. So, I sent my path to Johns Hopkins for a 2nd opinion after they told me this kind of spread would be unheard of for a grade 1, 7mm tumor. Pathology came back the same. For me, a stage 1, grade 1 diagnosis did not prove to be non-aggressive. I ended up with 6 mos. of chemo, rads, and a bilateral mx to treat my grade 1. Please realize this is not typical, but does happen. Best to you...Joni ",

Also, didn't get clear margins on the tumor removed from the breast. So, I am now having a mastectomy with axillary node dissection on Tues.   I could have opted for a 2nd lumpectomy, but there is so much junk in that breast now due to 2 biopsies that left a seroma cavity, alot of scarring, some noncancerous nodules. I just didn't feel I'd ever be comfortable with what I might be feeling or if this or that is a lump or not. So, for me a mastectomy is the best answer. Chemo and radiation will follow, then reconstruction. I know it's one of the most difficult decisions...and there's usually not a right or wrong.

What I've learned though, is.....for me, it is very easy for me to get discouraged in the midst of treatment and surgery recovery. After mastectomy, I felt such a loss and wondered if I made the right decision. (Yes, I did). During chemo I was so, very sick and really at that point, could have easily given up. The hardest 6 months of my life!!  I did not want rads at all..hated it....but pressed on. Finished 3 weeks ago, have healed nicely, even though I was burnt and blistered and in much pain.  Now, I'm having terrible joint pain with Femara that my onc wants me on for 5 years!! Trying to work through that. For me, no stage of this journey has been easy, and I've questioned myself many times on whether I'm doing the right things. But, after I finish each stage, I realize I'm stronger than I thought and yes, I can do this. I get alot of hope and comfort knowing so many have gone before me on this path and are now doing fine. I do feel we have to make alot of decisions when we are very unprepared. No wonder we second guess ourselves. Best wishes to you as you make this decision.",

It just makes me wonder if they should tell people that grade1, tubular, ER+, PR+, HER2-, <1cm tumors are the least aggressive. If my previous mammograms were clear and this is a nonaggressive cancer, then should I have 3 nodes involved?  I know bc is really not definable and has a mind of its own.

(biopsy, pathology, scans...I get all scans on disc....surgeries, etc.) Hopefully, your results will be benign, but it's good to do for any health issue.  You are doing all the right things....asking questions is huge!!! Best to you.",

The breast surgeon appt was scheduled. When my biopsy came back over that weekend, that surgeon called me on a Saturday to tell me it was cancer. Then I wrote down all my questions over the next day or two, so that at my appt, I could get some answers. However, my BS gave me a whole tote bag full of information and books at that first appt. I chose the breast surgeon based on phone calls made to friends and others in the medical community where I live. She came highly recommended and did not disappoint. I didn't have a GP involved in my whole experience. My Oncologist kind of took over those duties for the next two years.....dealing with everything from chemo to bladder infections, and aches and pains, as well as blood pressure meds, etc. My BS referred me to an Oncologist, but a personal friend of mine was in the same group so I asked to go to him. Remember, you are the customer through all of this....you have the right to all pathology reports, scans on disc (usually free the day of scan and you can get it within minutes of the scan),scan reports, surgery reports, etc. Hoping you get good results and never have to proceed.....Hugs.",

If they are positive then further node removal would probably be reccomended. I may be incorrect but that's how it was explained to me by the radiologist and my BS. The procedures were all almost without any pain.  Best wishes for your surgery. So glad your sis will be with you. Couldn't have made it without mine.. Joni ",

Going to Look Good Feel Better tomorrow. Then to Onc for bloodwork. Very anxious to see what wbc count will be since I didn't get Nuelasta shot. Have been trying to stay away from anything soy since I am 90% ER+. I've been given a bunch of protein drinks,bars, powders by friends...only to find out they are all soy proteinn. So, then I start reading labels and found that soy lecithin is in about everything.....even my whey protein powder. It's going to be hard to remove it totally from my diet, I think. (it's an emulsifier and is in chocolate, peanut butter, salad dressings, bread, etc.) Controversial, of course, as to whethere soy is a no-no or not, but thought I'd be pro-active and assume I shouldn't eat it. A few weeks ago, it was recommended to me by Johns Hopkins Breast Center to get a second opinion on my path slides. I am in Arkansas. Anyway I sent them and they put the report in the mail Friday so I'm anxious to see if they found anything new. My 3 path reports have all said the same things, but Johns Hopkins is interested because my tumor was 6mm, grade 1 yet had moved to 3 lymph nodes, 1 being an internal mammary node..which they were able to remove. So that puts me at Stage IIIc immediately. I guess it's very unusual to see that kind of movement from a tiny, low grade tumor. I'll be very surprised if they find anything new, but it's perplexing none the less. By the way, if anyone is wanting a 2nd opinion on path slides, it was only $250 and the report is done within 6 days. And my insurance covered it. Well worth it, if it brings peace of mind to someone. Well, Triple J's...we made it through July with much anticipation and I don't think it's a surprise that we met this challenge head on..with all the strength we could muster. We are strong, beautiful women and will never be the same because of this battle...We will know that we are able to do much more than we ever thought.

The body's response to anxiety and crisis is to produce an abundance of cortisol which causes inflammation in the body. This inflammation is a breeding ground for cancer. Now this gets my attention....I did have a major crisis prior to my diagnosis that involved my child. And for about a year I was devastated. I'm really curious to learn more about this.  Just some food for thought. Our bodies are so miraculous, yet seem so vulnerable in the face of this disease.

Have some blisters under the arm that have broken open and of course the radiated skin is so very red, but knowing the end is near makes it all worthwhile. After all this, I feel I can face anything!  Have the spring & summer off then will have recon (hopefully DIEP).  Blessings & warm spring wishes to you all, Joni1",

They started at 18, went up to 28 during chemo (which seems strange, however I read that happens during chemo). Now they are 16. I believe it is the CA 27-29 that I have done. I wish I wasn't so obsessive about scouring over my lab results, as this is now one more test I fret over. I think it isn't so good about telling you for sure of the presence of cancer, they do use it during treatment. A decrease in number can tell that the treatment is working. What I don't understand and have never really asked is, \"Why is there a normal range for tumor markers?\" Is it normal for everyone, or only those with breast cancer? I also have the CEA test every 3 months, which can be a tumor marker test for breast and colon cancer. It has always been normal as well. Like you all, I have never been so excited to get hair trimmed. Have had 2 trims so far. Not so excited about shaving the legs though. Joni1",

And I think it's just easier sometimes to \"run\" from things we don't want to face. Try not to take it  personal about your daughter. I think it's more about her feelings toward the BC than her feeling toward you. It's awkward, it's scary, there are alot of unknowns and it's just something she'll have to deal with (or not).  She probably knows she's not the one you need to lean on, since she can't really deal with it. Hopefully, you have a close friend you can share all the details with, and then just be there when your daughter is ready for more info. It's a shame we have to continue to worry and fret about our adult children when going thru BC!!! My mother had BC when I was 34 and I now realize I didn't show near enough concern. I just had no idea how it affects you. Good luck on Chemo Monday!! Joni",

With AC, I would be very sick for about 2-3 days after. I then had 12 weekly Taxol treatments. I had no problem driving with the Benadryl. You have to take steroids prior to taxol, and for me I think they offset the Benadryl effects. I drive a bus from 5 am till 7:45 am. I had no problem driving my route ever, on taxol. Never missed a day, morning or afternoon. Taxol was so much easier for me than AC. You may be totally different than me. Maybe someone could go with you the first time and you could drive home and see how you do. And, yes..people genuinely mean it when they say they want to help. I had a very hard time smelling the food people were bringing over. Would start throwing up just thinking about it. So, I sent out an email and asked those who wanted to bring food to just mail a gift card instead, and gave them 4 or 5 suggestions. That way my family was taken care of. It was very easy for others to help that way. And was so very welcome. Wishing you a gentle time with chemo, and many offers of help. hugs!",

I bumped the thread to the top. hopingforacure....my onc said you can skip one treatment and that's it. Don't know if that's standard procedure or not. And I don't know if you add it to the end or truly just skip it. Just to chime in about the BRCA testing...I did it and was very glad to know the results. I have 4 family members with bc and yet tested negative. Now that I've been tested, and paid the $3200.00, my sisters can be tested for $400.00 because the strand of DNA has already been tracked. Good news for them. Also, many of us have wondered about side effects as we continue with treatments. Ran into a family friend who is a pharmacist . His wife has had bc for 7 years. He said the side effects ARE cumulative, so will get rougher as you go. I will ask onc at next appt as well. Going to Look Good, Feel Better a week from today. Got my letter from chemo angel, 4 hats from heavenly hats, franceluxe wrap on the way. Guess I'm ready for whatever comes. About franceluxe, I requested a fabric I didn't see and Laurie emailed and said, \"No problem, we'll do it for you\". What a ministry!!! Let's not forget these organizations in the future as we are able to pay back for their kindnesses to us. I know they don't expect that from us, but if we are able, let's do it!!

After I went to Look Good Feel Better and came home with all the makeup, I looked at the labels and over half the products had these in them. Started looking at everything, and couldn't believe all the lotions, soaps, nail polish,makeup, shower gels that I had that have them. Got rid of it all. You know, I was thinking of friends who rub progesterone cream on, and it made me realize how our skin really does absorb stuff very well. I'm now trying to not use anything on my skin. Joni1",

Had premed steroids & benadryl cut in half since I had no allergic reaction last week. Low and behold, had a reaction. Had to get more steroids and stop tx for a few minutes. But was able to tolerate it finally. Blood counts are good. This is MUCH bettere than AC for me. Pam- Had to do nuepogen during AC. Really worked well to bring the counts up. Some bone pain though. I think the radiation issue is due to no lymph node involvement for you. I had uni mx with no recon, but have decided to have good breast removed and have DIEP flap surgery. Consulting with NOLA.  Course I have to wait 6 months after radiation....which will be about this time next year. Like you, I just want to make sure I've done all I can. Congrats Dianne, Jayne & Gill.....you're heroes...so glad you are through. Joni2- hang in there through radiation. I'll be talking to you as I get closer to that...probably mid Feb since I'll have chemo to mid Jan. The hardest part is over for you. Joni1",

And one was just diagnosed with mets to liver and has traveled to MD Anderson in Houston this week. This hit me hard. Though when I think of 4 ladies with bc, I guess, sadly, the odds are good that at least one of us would see progression. I find myself anxious now, when any of us have tumor marker testing or scans. I feel like I should be stronger, but sometimes i find my hope is hanging by a thread! Surprisingly this Christmas season, I haven't been inclined to decorated, bake, cook, etc. The big family dinner was to be at my house this year, but I had to cancel. Didn't even put up a tree. I did get presents bought and wrapped, and enjoyed it. Just kind of freeing to not feel pressure to decorate. I'm sure the desire will return next year. I think another year of 4 surgeries has just wiped me out.  On another note, just found out I will be a grandma in August!! How exciting is that??  Hope you are all doing well and loving life again.

I think if the port is on the rt, they put the catheter into a vein in the neck and if it's on the rt, they go with vein in heart. But I may be wrong about that. Best wishes for a successful surgery. I feel much better today, but still some pain & stiffness. No further bleeding on gauze. I guess I'll see you on the July chemo thread?? Hugs to all, Joni",

Hope all of you have Look Good, Feel Better classes near you. This is something you definitely will want to do. I got invited a few weeks ago to come to the next one in Aug. The director told me I'd get $300 of high end makeup with all kinds of tips for makeup during and after chemo.  Also, ordered my free \"It's A Wrap\" scarf from Laurie Erickson. Appreciate all the tips and survival hints. Keep 'em coming. I feel so much better knowing you all are with me. How is everyone planning to work through chemo? My ONC said day 3-5 would be my worst on AC. So does that mean, stay home and don't work or plan to try and work? I drive a bus for developmentally disabled preschoolers am & pm and I'm off in the middle of the day. Is that sufficient to rest and recuperate?? Just curious what everyone else knows or has heard. Welcome to all ......July Jugs-or-nots???? haha Joni(1)",

They wanted bloodwork first...I said,\"oh, ok I have a port\" they said, \"oh we don't use ports for blood draws unless you're having a chemo treatment that day\". So I got a nice stick in my overused left arm. Then drank the barium sat around for an hour. Go back for pet scan, \" We need to start an IV \", I said,\" I have a port\". \"Oh we don't use that for this.\" What the?????

So good to read the lashes are returning quickly for you. I've read so many different things about hair. Like...2-3- weeks after finishing taxol, hair that's been growing  on head falls out again...PLEASE say that wasn't true for you?? Did you get neuropathy, and if so has it subsided?  I started having some weird tingling, numbing in my nose and mouth last Thurs, so onc ordered a brain MRI to rule out a brain tumor..FREEAK OUT....immediately called with results that were normal. He hadn't heard of too many who had had facial numbness with taxol, but low and behold I looked on this board and found a thread about taxol and facial numbness...10 or so women had had it. Anyway mine went away within 24 hours. Nice to know my brain's ok, but geeeeesh, what a shock.  Then I got a slight rash on my arm from the gadolinium contrast they used for the MRI. Don't know if any of you have researched that...there are so many lawsuits because of the use of gadolinium. I think any of us who choose to use MRI's in the future for monitoring our bc will have to use it. Please look into it.....kinda scary, but I'm wondering what choice we have....apparenty it's the only contrast that can be used for MRI. Let's see, had a small conjunctival cyst drained from my eye yesterday. Had it for a couple weeks and was driving me crazy...right on the white of my eye, a big blob of clear jelly looking stuff. Feels much better this a.m. Other than that...all is well. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas! Joni1",

I had a prophylactic mx on the left side, then recon on both. Got a nice tummy tuck out of the deal!! And lost 20 lbs. somehow. That was a great benefit as I was gaining weight and retaining fluid on femara. Hopefully it lasts. It feels wonderful to no longer have any breast tissue. With chemo, rads, mx, and femara I feel I have done everything possible to fight this disease. Will have my Stage 2 DIEP in Dec. It's great to hear of everyone's progress. Joni1",

I had read someone gained 7 pounds over the course of the first treatment day. Well, I gained 9.5!!! But by  this morning had lost 8.5 again. Praise the kidneys are working. I had a  SEVERE headache about 3 hours after treatment. Took compazine, Tylenol, soaked in a tub. Finally got relief after midnite, and was able to get up at 4am and go to work. Surprised at the intensity and duration of the headache (it was accompanied by nausea). I don't have any sleep meds but wondered if I couldn't have taken a hydrocodone or lortab left over from surgery. I will ask that next appt. Feel ok now, and will be heading to get my wig styled this afternoon. I've had a few days myself where tears flowed freely. I think my college boys see that and wonder if I haven't been given some news that I haven't told anyone. I have assured them I will let them know of everything the Dr. says....yet I  know they are concerned....which brings more tears.

I cried before we did it....just a final realization I guess. Hard to see myself in the mirror. My wig looks so close to my style very few have noticed. My wbc was a little low, but the GRA??? was bottomed out, so I'm on my 3rd day of 5 Nuepogen shots. 2nd AC on Mon Aug 10. I will get Neulasta from here on out after each tx. Was hoping to bounce back, but no luck. I feel great. Haven't missed any work except day of tx and Dr. appts. I also find it helpful to stay on my schedule. Onc said I'd have to get 2 flu shots...one being the swine flu shot in Dec. If anyone is still suffering with constipation, It was recommended to me to take Citracel powder twice a day, and a probiotic capsule 3x daily. It has been a wonderful solution for me. I've always struggled with being regular. I now go 1-2 times every day. :) How is everyone doing with weight since starting tx? I was losing prior to starting, probably due to 4 surgeries.....have since stayed about the same since first AC. Really afraid of what Taxol and steroids might do after AC.

I went for a visit yesterday with a lymphedema massage therapist who is also a onc nurse. She verified the same info and said we're all different that way. It doesn't appear I have lymphedema, but she's showing me how to do lymphatic drainage massages to preempt anything in the future. She said it can rear its ugly head 10-20 years down the road. Right now, she said all the fluid in the area is normal from surgery for at least 2-3  months out. She said exercise and movement are good, just not weight bearing or resistance. OH, and also, anything that turns the skin red is not good....hot tubs, sunburn, friction from rubbing, scratching..etc..  Hope this is helpful. Joni(1)",

I'll follow with 12 weekly treatments of Taxol, then rads, hormonal therapy. Wish I was in FL, I'd love to see your photos. Lori....I guess what I felt was so unusual about mine, is how mine was not aggressive , Grade 1, and HER2-. Just shouldn't have gone anywhere!! But we all know this disease has a mind of its own. Pap...Thanks for the info. I guess I'll just take what meds I have with me and see what I need then. My onc said I'd be there 5 hours...is that what everyone else on A/C is doing? I don't have to take Neulasta after 1st treatment. Onc said if I bounce back I won't need it each time. But the first time I don't I'll be taking it after all treatments. Go WBC's!!! Just some FYI....my dentist told me if I get mouth lesions from chemo, he has the ability to zap them with a laser and they will immediately go away. Good to know, hope I don't need it. Not knowing what to expect from 1st treatment Monday. People are wanting to bring meals to our family. Will I really need it?? Onc said days 3-5 will be my worst. Are meals brought in necessary? Not that I wouldn't love it, but just don't want it if I'm able to function.  For a good meal, I can fake alot of symptoms...lol Welcome to everyone.....pre chemo brain is setting in. I now have to read posts with a pen and paper in hand and take notes abou what you all are writing. So I can remember names and such. best wishes, Joni1",

I've never been fond of immunizations and tried to stay away from them and just let my body fight off whatever and have been pretty fortunate so far. Now what??? Anyone else concerned? Joni1",

I've had zofran, compazine, and now kytril and phenergan with this last one. I suppose they will want to try emend this next time. I have never thought of giving up till now, but I actually believe this stuff is killing me. Could one more tx really make that much difference in the outcome? Has anyone else reacted like this?
