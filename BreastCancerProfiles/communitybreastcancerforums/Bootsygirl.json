And that I have (by my own fault through ignorance first and denial second) waited too long to find out. Here is the timeline. I am 37, 3 kids 3,4 and 7 and no history of breast cancer in my family... Maybe that is why I am so naive. Last December- had a weird bee sting feeling in right breast- aware of it, but only had it once so didn't think much of it.  January- horribly sore breasts around period- so bad I took a pregnancy test b/c that was always my first pregnancy sign. Negative. Breasts felt better after period ( I had never had cyclical breast pain prior to last January). Right breast worse than left. Feb. Annual OBGYN appt. mention breast pain- dr. Says hormonal, I should be lucky this is the first I have had it. Does breast exam- feels nothing abnormal. I believe her.  March-August- sporadic \"bee sting/shooting pain\" in right breast as well as horrible hormonal pain before period. Also start experiencing awful cystic acne. Dermatologist puts me on spironolactone- I can only take it 2 months because of even worse breast pain and absent periods. Not a fan of how I was feeling so decided to deal with acne. End of August/ Sept.- start  having weird shoulder pain and knot in right shoulder. Chalk it up to working out/ muscle strain. Sometimes travels down arm (convince self of carpal tunnel). Start googling. \"BC doesn't hurt\"- shew!!!  \"In fact, BC does hurt!\"- the beginning of panic and anxiety. Stop googling. October- freaked out that pain in right breast persists and  shoulder and sometimes rib cage so go back to OB/GYN. She feels nothing abnormal except very fibrous tissue and says let's send you for a baseline- it's probably just hormones and fibrous tissue though. (Why just one achy breast though?)  November- mammogram normal. What I think will make all pain and anxiety magically disappear does not. December- call OB/GYN again and explain still having pain despite normal mammo, now what? Takes me off caffeine and adds Vitamin E. In December, I still have sore right shoulder, sore spot on back, occasional right ribcage/sternum pain and still very aware of achy right breast. Add \"weird vision\" to the list- not sure if related... But since I'm at it....  January- I have an appt. with a breast specialist on the 27th finally. I have had two panic attacks (the only 2 of my life) in the past month fretting over a. Not only the possibility of having BC but mostly, because this has been \"on the radar\" for almost 13 months now and what if I have truly waited too long to have a good chance at an early diagnosis? What if all of these other pains (right ribcage twinging as I type) are progression? I too know I could be far off, but as I said... Sometimes you just have a feeling. I have a feeling.  I am posting because these boards have already been a tremendous wealth of information and well... I guess since the ONLY person I have talked to about this is my hubby and he thinks I am borderline nuts about it... After a year, I needed to get it out there.  So, thank you if you are reading. ❤️ God bless each and every one of you on your journeys! You are truly inspirational.  Log in to post a reply",
