The sensation that led me to find it reminded me of a clogged duct from nursing, but I haven't nursed in a year. It is palpable, movable and elongated spanning more than half of my breast. My OB and GP both said it felt more like an entire swollen duct/lobule. A few days later I noticed a hard and tiny bump nearby but closer to the nipple. My ob ran a prolactin test to make sure I wasn't lactating...negative. Next an ultrasound and then a mammogram done separately at different centers. My results came back a few weeks ago as \"no evidence of malignancy.\" OB said to just continue with annual exams. The lumps have since grown. The round one went fron a small bead size to a pea size and the elongated one has gotten thicker. So now what?! Is this worrisome Log in to post a reply",
