I was referred to a pulmonolgist who requested another CT, this time of the chest. The first CT was of the abdomen, but they found the nodule incidentally. The results came back that the lung nodule is only a tiny bit larger (1.1 to 1.2) in about 4 months time, so I doubt it's cancer. He did say, though, that it's shaped oddly and he has to 'think about it a little bit' of decide what he wants to do next. He did not say it looked benign... and I... didn't ask. However, the breast nodule they also discovered on the chest CT... unsure. I've been scheduled for a mammogram tomorrow. In the meantime, I'm worried and wondering if this is often a normal finding and nothing to worry about. Pulmonologist would ONLY say I needed a mammogram. So, the breast nodule is 1.9 x .5 and behind a breast implant... so it's located in the back near the chest wall, I'm thinking. I didn't ask too many questions.. kind of felt like everything became surreal all of a sudden. Any thoughts on this? I have horrid symptoms, but I also have been diagnosed with iron deficiency.. one doc said 'anemia,' and the other just kept calling it 'iron deficient.' My ferritin is 7.4 with no explanation. Colonoscopy and EGD showed nothing to explain the anemia. Again, I have terrible symptoms and can't do much of anything anymore. I also have been diagnosed with Grade II Diastolic Dysfunction and have heart valve issues with mild biatrial enlargement. I only mention these other issues as a possibility for my symptoms. Honestly, I don't know if they've even invented a word for the kind of fatigue I'm having. So... I guess I'm here because I know I will be worrying tonight due to the mammogram tomorrow and all the unknowns involved until then (anticipation at its worst). Same question in my mind like so many here.... do benign nodules come in specific sizes and/or shapes? This one is elongated. I'm sorry for rambling. Just am hoping someone has had a similar nodule... elongated, similar in size.. and have had it be benign..?? Log in to post a reply",
