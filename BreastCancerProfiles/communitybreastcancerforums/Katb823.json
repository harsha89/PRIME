Day before Easter I broke out in a rash and I woke up Easter morning with a bad case of the hives that kept spreading rapidly throughout the day. I ended up at the ER where they gave me benedryl, predisone and Pepcid intravenously. They also gave me rx of same 3 to take for 4 days with stronger dose then going down to lower dose. I woke up on Monday so much better but today (Tuesday) I woke up with very swollen eyes and hives around my mouth and chin, I took benedryl today and it has helped. My oncologist said to come in tmrw if it's not better. So guess I'll see. I had horrible itching as well and clawed myself like crazy.",
