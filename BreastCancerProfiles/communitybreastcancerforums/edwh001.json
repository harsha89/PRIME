But cancer runs in my family and 5 out of 6 siblings have had it and my brother is getting a biopsy today for his second cancer and I go the 25th for one. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family. Emmy",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2012 03:13PM - edited Jan 24, 2012 03:13PM by edwh001 Hi all, I am happy to say I did not have reconstruction 5 years ago ( at the time did'nt know my ins would pay for it). For the first few years I was unsure of what to do or if I could get it done. My ins would not pay for a bilateral mastectomy so I wear a prosthesis when away from home. I wish I could of had a bilateral, I know I would of been happier, more freedom to just put on a shirt and go. For me the less cutting on me the better. Like most of you I wanted to get on with my life and did'nt want any more pain or complications, so yes now I am happy I did not get reconstruction. Emmy",
