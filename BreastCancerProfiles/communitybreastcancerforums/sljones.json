Any breast tenderness during your periods?  Are their certain points in your monthly cycle where the spot at 10 o'clock isn't sore? Do you feel an actual mass under the tender spot? Or is it just your breast tissue that is sore?  It could be a swollen lymph node for whatever reason, but it also could be a mass that you should have checked out- an ultrasound and/or mammogram (depending on your age, and density of your breasts) could be done to evaluate things.  I hope it all works out well for you!

But the fact that it says \"is discordant with the image findings\" means to me that the mass looks suspicious for malignancy on imaging, but the actual tissue was \"benign\"  which doesn't always add up- which I think is why the MD is suggesting just removing the mass by an excisional biopsy- and at least then you can have it out of you, and have the entire thing tested.... It makes me wonder what the actual patho report says- what was benign about it?  was it fatty tissue, glandular tissue, a fibrocystic mass?  I hope you don't have to wait too much longer- I am in the same boat as you, I had a core needle biopsy three days ago, and I am told I should get the results tomorrow: 28 years old with no family history, mass  0.7 mm x 10 mm x 0.7mm Mamo/ US microcalcifications, hypoechgenic, irregular boarders.. So.. I wait.",
