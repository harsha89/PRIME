      "Content": "Dec 4, 2012 04:44PM - edited Dec 4, 2012 04:44PM by lesleyag I started chemo Oct 31, and was supposed to get an infusion of Herceptin, Taxotere and Carboplatin. However I had a bad infusion reaction to both Herceptin and Taxotere so the 1 day infusion stretched to 3 days.  The Taxotere was switched to Abraxane which I seem to be able to tolerate okay. I have a year of weekly Herceptin to go so hopefully the intial reaction I had will not be repeated. The taste thing is most annoying to be sure! Nothing tastes good at all, can't wait for it all to be over with so things taste normal again. The hair loss does not bother me at all :-)",
