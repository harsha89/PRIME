Six years later it returned in her left hip, and she had a hip replacement. Two years ago a spot on her spine, treated with radiation. This year it came back in the same spot, more rads but now it had spread to more places on her spine. Two weeks ago she underwent surgery on her spine, and restarted Herceptin this week. It is 14 years since the original diagnosis, my granddaughter is almost 14 and an honors student, and my daughter remains optimistic about her future. Miracles do happen.  Peace and hope to all of you. ",
