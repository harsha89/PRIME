I have had 2 breast biapsys and they wete both beign. Unfortunately even though I felt both tumors the mamaograms for each didnt dhow them. They were by my right srmpit area. With both of them I made the mistake of not being my own advocate and waiting about a year to press the issues. I coyldnt take the pain no more. The first tumor grew to be the size of an egg before they removed it and 10 years later the second one was about half that size. They both grew. I got lucky they were beign because I let them go so long. Once you have a tumor your doctor should have you get a mamogram yearly. Now once again I have something in the same place as the other 2, just under my rigjt arm pit. The pain and swelling is unbelievable. I wasnt getting my yearly mamograms like I should of. The doctor can feel it. This time he says its soft. I got a mamogram and yet again like the last 2 they see nothing there and the ultrasound showed limp notes. But my doctor did take a prevaution and i have an appointment with a surgeon. He knows for some reason, i believe its the location and how the mamogram mainly focuses on the large breast part, that tumors never have showed up. My point is dont be a fool like I was thinking it wont happen to me and put off a mamogram. If you feel something, negative tests or not be firm that somethings there. Mamograms are amazing but you could be rare like me and they dont show up. Finally beign tumors do grow, mine grew to the size of an egg. So dont freak out if it is growing just have it tested as soon as you can. Be safe not sorry. My gma put her mamograms off and passed quickly from breast cancer because of it. One day a year for testing seems to be alot to do when it comes to the time to do it. But its not! Being your own advocate and firm with your doctors to get answers and be tested is the only way to go. Dont put it off like I did.",
