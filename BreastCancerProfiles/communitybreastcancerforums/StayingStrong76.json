Unfortunately my middle sister who had stage 3 ovarian cancer sadly passed away June 9 2014. I had my ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed, not my uterus. I'm considering the Bilateral Prophylactic Masectomy, but am very scared. Especially with all the other cancers this gene mutation causes. I don't know what to do. If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
