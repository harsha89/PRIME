The superclavicular radiation is the only question, but I think it may not be worth it to do it - like the RO says. I'll be ready for my set up appt on the 15th then I guess! :-) I'll be checking in and hearing how things are going with all of you. ",

I am scheduled to have my set up on the 15th and start rads on the 19th. The meeting with RO yesterday was interesting. He is an interesting duck. But he really knows his research. The only thing he was a little torn on was if he should do rads to my Super Clavicle area. He was leaning towards no, as was his son who is also a radiology oncologist. The risk of side effects for that are greater than the rewards he thinks. Especially since I only had 1 of 4 nodes with micrometastasis. The reoccurrence rate for that area is only between 3-6% to begin with. Doing rads there might bring it down to 1.5%. So they both were leaning towards not doing it. He was really laid back towards lots of other things - like deodorant saying that wearing aluminum or zinc deodorant causing problems with rads is just \"oncolore\" and is a myth. He said I wouldn't need deep breath holds the radiation that would hit my heart - if it did - would be so low it wouldn't be a concern. He said he could show me the mapping and numbers of it to reassure me. He also said there is a new study from Harvard saying that many of the things they tell you to avoid for lymphedema don't actually affect it. But like I said, he backs it all up with research. And solid research too, studies where the participant numbers are huge and the results have clear links. I also now know the entire history of his family - where & how he and his wife met, where his son & wife met, his other son is a bachelor...etc. etc. And he went through the history of the treatment of breast cancer leading up to why lumpectomy is better for certain groups of women, and a lesson on the physics of radiation. We talked about my actual rads for maybe 30 min. of the two hour meeting. It was a little bizarre. I don't know if I'd have time to get a second opinion, but maybe I should...I don't know. I am supposed to have my set up appointment on the 15th and start on the 19th. That's not a lot of time to squeeze in another appointment. I suppose I can call though. Here the questions running through my mind: 1. Should I do clavicle - I'm leaning towards no. 2. How big are the tattoos? They said I can choose tattoos or tape, but I heard the tape can tear your skin off. 3. Is it weird he is so laid back and not worried about things like heart, deodorant, etc.? 4. They said they would talk about creams, lotions, etc. when/if I started having side effects. But maybe they will discuss it more at the set up appointment. They said there are no real restrictions on anything except maybe avoid layering the breast with stuff before each rads session. Again - so laid back - is that weird? What do you guys think? ",

Kamalo - I had #4 today and felt that it was tender and sore a bit too. When did you end chemo? I'm curious how long this stupid neuropathy will last!! I am only taking the vitamin B6 for it. No one ever mentioned any other meds. I am going to get some Nioxin for my scalp. One of the gals in my chemo thread is using it and has a pretty decent head of hair now. My MO said I could use it. Polilifax - I looked into the coobie bras, but thought they were all spandex. I'll have to look again. It's good to hear what you are doing to help things!! Thanks for sharing with us! AMH - I am not far enough in to say much, but I will tell you my RO keeps saying, \"It's not as bad as chemo fatigue.\" HOWEVER, so many people also told me Taxol was easier than AC during chemo and that wasn't the case for me. So I think that you just might not know until you get there how your body is going to react. kay - Good luck with the tape! LOL Hope the first treatment went well. Interesting about the tape vs. tatoos. Glad it is working pretty well for people! I'm looking forward to not having to go in for a couple of days at least. This is an annoying process. I was surprised that last night (after treatment #3) my boob hurt. Tender, especially where the tumor was and where my arm pit and chest meet. Not quite the lymph node area, but close. It's not a huge issue yet, but I just wonder if it hurts already, what it will be like in a few weeks. Oh well...we'll see. Hang in there all. Weekend is a coming!",

After a conversation with a family friend that is an oncology nurse (and knows many of my doctors personally), I called my MO and asked her thoughts on superclavical radiation. My friend's point was that even if my MO didn't have an opinion, she could run it by her partners or the breast conference team that meets weekly in this area. She said that based on my situation, she wouldn't do the superclavical radiation...which is what my eccentric RO said too. So I'm good with that. I, of course, can get a second opinion if I want, but I don't think it's necessary. Meg - Thank you for the details. It does sound like we are very similar and it's good to know what's ahead!!

In addition to the topical stuff and prescription, he is going to try to see if they can do my boosts next week and give my breast a chance to rest and heal before finishing my last ten whole breast treatments. If this all doesn't help, they'll move on to the Silvadene? cream (is this what you are using?).

Because I had read things ahead of time, I specifically asked about left-side and having to do breathing. Maybe it's the angle mine is at, but my RO said no deep breathing necessary that the amount of radiation that the heart would receive is very minimal. I also have to say that the office is at a cancer center, but not attached to a hospital. It's small, so I think I've reaped the benefits of that. My consult was just over a week ago Thurs. My simulation was a week after that, they formulated my plan the next day (Friday) and I had my first treatment today (Mon.). So yay for small places I guess. So much less waiting for once. So I did have my first appointment today. It was easy peasy. I was on my back and luckily I don't have pain issues like some of you. I do have to do 33 treatments instead of 20. Kind of a bummer but oh well. The RO said that in order to treat the first two levels of my nodes effectively and not get too much radiation in the breast at once, they needed to do the standard fractionated course instead of the quick course (or whatever it's called). As long as I'm done before my son gets out of school in May, I'm ok with it. I have aloe, aquaphor, and a cotton bra coming, and I have coconut oil on hand, but we'll see if they are even that necessary. I did go to the grocery store this morning, but now, I'm going to get my butt up, eat a salad, do my arm exercises, and walk on the treadmill. No being lazy for me!

Today when my RO showed me my scans from the set up and went over what their dosage-ist decided, he explained that from where the clips were from my lumpectomy (aka my tumor site) and where my two levels of lymph nodes are, they couldn't get the dose high enough to effectively cover both areas without the breast getting so much radiation that it would have made the burns \"bad\". I can't remember what word he actually used (dumb chemo brain), but it was that the radiation would have been too much for my breast tissue to handle if we tried to cover both areas at the same time in 20 sessions. I'll be interested to see where my skin is at in a week. I thought last night I was having a little bit of ache in my lymph area, but I could just be attributing something else to rads. I haven't been doing anything special to my skin, but maybe I'll put coconut oil on after treatment. Do you guys think that helps? In any case, I have three treatments down and 30 to go! Woohoo!",

And I'm taking note of all the creams and lotions you guys mention! I have to say, I feel for some of you that have to travel so far for treatment. My MIL yesterday was talking about my SIL potentially traveling several states away for proton therapy, but said no one wants to stay at a hotel during treatment. I said how many people on my forum do have to travel far and some even have to stay in hotels. I am lucky enough to live in a city that it takes about 30 minutes max (on a normal traffic time) to get from one end to the other. (Granted, rush hour and construction can slow this down.) Most people live within 15 min. of a cancer treatment center because this group of doctors has five locations around the area. I drive 15 min. to my center and park right at the door almost. The RO office is right inside and I normally don't have to hardly wait. Today I was out of my car, in for treatment, and back out to my car in 10 minutes. Drive 15 min. home. The whole escapade was about 45 min. max. I can't imagine the long drive some of you have to deal with on top of everything else! Hang in there everyone! And have a great Easter!!",

They gave me a cloth with silver in it. The silver kills yeast and the cloth both helps keep the skin from rubbing against skin, but also helps keep it dry. They said no aquaphor down there in order to keep it dry and clean. She said they would use that more on the \"outside/upper\" parts of the breast. They said if it got worse or itchy to let them know because they would give a low-dose steroid for it. And there were other things they could try. This makes sense to try because I keep tucking my shirt up under there when I'm sitting around just to alleviate the minor irritation. Hopefully it works!",

For the news, for the strength and the hope that you need to get you through the next few weeks and months. Paco - Nevada huh? :-) I don't know exactly what kind of shape I have. I have a definite line from my arm pit to my collarbone and the rest is just all red. My nipple is starting to get discolored though. I have a light spot (or maybe a big dark spot with one normal spot!) on it now. So weird. I haven't seen a single bill yet from the RO's office. Maybe my husband is picking them up, but I think we just haven't been billed yet. Marigold - I might be getting boosts next week and then they will finish the last 8 regular treatments after that. I'll find out for sure on Monday when they see how my skin looks. I'll be excited to give my boob a little bit of a rest if they do, but the doctor said it is a *little* better to finish the regulars first! You have a lot of stuff you are using. They just gave me a prescription for the Silvedene cream this morning and I'm hoping it soothes things a bit. metoo - I never thought of corn starch. Maybe after I heal the open wounds a bit more I'll try that! The doctor suggested using baking soda if soap hurts to clean under there. it seems like that would be painful, but he said it would neutralize since it's a base and our skin is acidic. I don't really itch, it just stings. Kay - I have no experience with boost yet really. But the gal who develops the treatment plans came in on Thursday to look as they were setting me up for my regular treatment. Since they are thinking about maybe doing my boosts next week, she was checking out my irritation. She used a penlight to highlight for the tech where the boost would be and it was definitely not my whole breast. It was a much smaller circle around where my lumpectomy scar is. My MO's office called maybe two weeks ago to set up an appointment for right after radiation ends. I don't know if that's typical or if it's just because I'm starting tamoxifen next and she's the person in charge of that. My sister-in-law who was diagnosed after me had the same sort of issue come up with the genetic testing. They have a letter expressly stating it would be covered by insurance and then got billed - I think for being out of network. So they are going through that fight too. Veeder - I can't imagine not having a point person and not being referred to an MO right away. That's crazy!! How frustrating that all must be. Maybe it's because I'm in a small system that focuses purely on cancer and not in a big hospital, but I think the group (which has about 6 clinics across our metro area) works so well together. At my clinic, I even have a nurse navigator who is totally wonderful. So if I ever had a question about what to do or who to see or what was next, I call her and she gets it figured out for me. I'm really grateful for the care I've received. I'm glad you are healing a bit, but I'm a little bummed to hear that it doesn't heal as fast as I had hoped! Beavertnx - Congrats on finishing!! 20/33 down. I am hoping the Silvedene cream will provide some topical relief for my open are under my breast. Still searching for a camisole that will give me some support without trying to suffocate me. LOL The RO offered me a pain pill today and I was surprised. I said I definitely didn't need one. I just wanted some topical relief! Hopefully, I'll get that this weekend. On Monday, they will decide if they should do boosts or regular. He sounds like he'd prefer to do regular - said that it was a *little* better to finish those before the boosts, but he's not totally against it and my skin may not cooperate. We'll see. Weather is not going to be good tonight or tomorrow. Then it will still be cold next week. :-( I'd love to have good weather stay around, but on the upside, I can keep wearing baggy sweatshirts and stuff that cover up the fact that I'm not wearing a bra! :-) Happy weekend everyone!

It's worse today, so I think I'm definitely going to have to do something. Even though I don't want to darn it. I just wanted a couple doctor free weeks. Oh well. I do still have a steroid pack refill that the RO gave me during radiation. It's the same thing that the MO gave me for the taxol rash....but it's probably bad to self-medicate. :-) Happy Mother's Day everyone!",

Hydrocortisone cream has made a big difference though it\u2019s not gone yet. I started the LiveStrong program at the Y today. I highly recommend it.",
