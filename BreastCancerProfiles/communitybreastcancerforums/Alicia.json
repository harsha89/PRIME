But with 16 chemos infusions (including 12-weekly taxol), plus additional blood drawn for scans and other tests, my veins have become really hard to find. Now when I go for Zometa injections, it takes forever to find a vein, and the nurses have said it could take a few years to recover. So if I had it to do over again, I would probably get a port.   2.

In my case, I didn't feel heartburn, but I just was worried about a sore in my throat that wouldn't heal. I finally went to an ENT, who looked at my throat with an endoscope and said the vocal chords were irritated from acid reflux. It's actually possible to have this symptom without classic heartburn symptoms. He prescribed Omeprazole and I'm also supposed to watch my diet -- no acidic or spicy foods, no coffee, tea or caffeine, avoiding greasy foods, etc. (not much fun!) If I'm really strict about it, my throat seems to heal, but the minute I break the rules or get under stress, it's back. Also, Omeprazole has been found to cause rebound symptoms when you stop, at least for several months. So I'm not sure I've been very helpful to you. If I were in your position, I would try to see an ENT or GI specialist and do some research about diet. Good luck!",

Also, if you don't have a breast surgeon, it may take you several weeks to get an appointment with one.  I'm not qualified to comment on your symptoms.

When I was diagnosed almost two years ago, I remember telling my sister, I refuse to wear those pink ribbons. I was terrified of chemo and I dealt with the news by working hard as though nothing could slow me down. The few days after I was diagnosed, I remember sitting at my desk trembling a few times unable to rise above the fear and then realizing that the most positive thing I could do was to just be with my feelings while they were there, to accept that this was where I was. I think everyone deals in their own way. I love that you are going Scuba diving, and I can't think of a better song to motivate. For what it's worth,for me the chemo was easier than I imagined, and I showed up at work every day except the days I went for treatment. Of course everyone's different, but many women do manage to work full-time throughout. I wish you the best, Gigi. And I agree, this is a great place to be.",

I also think it's great that you do self exams and that you are going to see a doctor. I hope you will make arrangements to see a doctor on a regular basis after this. Not knowing what's going on with your health is much scarier than getting a check-up. Also, with a regular doctor, you will probably be able to get an appointment sooner if you have a serious concern. Even if you did have cancer, I'm sure everyone on this forum will tell you that catching it sooner is better than later. Breast cancer is usually not a death sentence, and treatments have become much more tolerable than they were in the past. From my own experience, I wish I had been doing self exams and seeing a breast surgeon more regularly. That's because the mammo and sono I had in February were clear, so I cancelled the appointment with my breast surgeon. Four months later, I accidently noticed a lump that was bothering me. It turned out to be nothing, but during the exam my surgeon biopsied another mass that did turn out to be cancer. It was caught early and the prognosis is good, but I could have possibly avoided chemo and radiation had it been caught before it started to spread. Even so, I am SO much better off than had I not gone to the doctor at all. Hope I'm not being too preachy. Good luck to you!",

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE After a 36-month follow-up period, early initiation of ZOL provided significant benefits in bone health and improved DFS in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy for early hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Abstract SUMMARY OncologySTAT Editorial Team Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have greater efficacy than tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid (ZOL) have been demonstrated to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of fracture associated with AIs, and have also been demonstrated to improve cancer outcomes. Eidtmann et al reported the results of a 36-month follow-up of the Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trial (ZO-Fast). Patients for whom ZOL treatment was initiated immediately after randomization (immediate ZOL group) experienced improved bone health and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with those for whom ZOL treatment was delayed (delayed ZOL group). In this open-label multicenter randomized trial, patients were postmenopausal women or women who were recently menopausal because of chemotherapy or ovarian suppression for hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer. Baseline lumbar spine (LS) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores were required to be > -2.0. Patients were randomly assigned to receive immediate or delayed ZOL treatment. All patients received oral daily letrozole for 5 years and daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. In the immediate ZOL group, ZOL was provided beginning immediately after randomization. In the delayed ZOL group, ZOL was provided if the patient's T-score became < -2.0 after a nontraumatic bone fracture or if an asymptomatic fracture was detected by spinal x-ray. A total of 1065 patients were randomly assigned in the original ZO-Fast trial. Baseline and 36-month BMD data were available for 314 patients in the immediate ZOL group and 319 in the delayed ZOL group. From baseline to 36 months, LS BMD increased by 4.39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.69%-5.11%) in the immediate ZOL group, and decreased by 4.9% (95% CI, -5.54% to -4.25%) in the delayed ZOL group (least squares mean difference between groups, 92.9%; 95% CI, 8.37%-10.20%; P < .0001). Slightly smaller but still significant changes were observed for total hip BMD (P < .0001). More patients in the immediate ZOL group than in the delayed ZOL group with baseline lumbar T-scores between -2.0 and -1.0 transitioned to normal BMD (P < .001), and more patients in the delayed ZOL group than in the immediate ZOL group developed severe osteopenia/osteoporosis (P < .001). However, similar proportions of patients in the immediate and delayed ZOL groups experienced fractures (5.0% vs 6.0%; P = .502). A total of 506 of 532 immediate ZOL patients and 489 of532 delayed ZOL patients were disease free and alive, corresponding to an absolute difference of 3.2% between the two groups and a relative reduction of 41% in the risk of having a DFS event (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.588; 95% CI, 0.361-0.959; P = .0314). Compared with the delayed ZOL group, the immediate ZOL group had fewer local (0.4% vs 1.9%) and distant (3.8% vs 5.6%) recurrences, and fewer immediate than delayed ZOL patients developed bone metastases (1.7% vs 3.2%). Adverse events were similar between groups. Influenza-like symptoms were more common in the immediate than in the delayed ZOL group. Renal failure or impairment was less common in the immediate than in the delayed ZOL group (0.2% vs 0.6%). Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in 2 patients in the immediate ZOL group. The results of this analysis showed that early initiation of ZOL provided significant benefits in bone health and improved DFS in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy for early hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.

Also, I had smaller doses over 12 weeks, which is just as effective but less toxic. (You don't need Neulasta shots then.) I took Taxol along with Avastin and had no problems with it. You can always stop if it's a bad experience for you, but it may well be that the worst is over for you.",
