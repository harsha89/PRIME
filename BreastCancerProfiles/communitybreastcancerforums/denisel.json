Has anyone elected to have the DIEP without tissue expanders first? My PS prefers to use tissue expanders but due to my need to return to work he can do the surgery without the use of TE's but said the look is a bit more natural when using expanders. I am afraid my paid FMLA leave will be unpaid while I have the expanders in for two months prior to the DIEP surgery so I will need to go back to work. I have a high stress job and would rather do the surgery sooner than later. Any input on this?",
