In my situation the surgeon, I feel,  ignored what I told her about the tumor appearing over a 2 month period and that it certainly seemed aggressive based on that alone. She more or less brushed it off and said you'll have lumpectomy followed by rads in 4 weeks for 30 treatments then tamoxifen for 5 years. When the pathology came back a grade 3 with comedonecrosis she brightly stated \"no lymph node involvement! but we're sending for the oncotype dx\". Still no mention of the possibility of chemo!  When oncotype came back a 36...the nurse told me chemo is definitely needed since 25% recurrence rate without it. I guess hindsight is 20/20. It went from a 1.5cm stage 1 tumor-like a wart or skin tag the way the surgeon acted to an aggressive, grade 3 tumor that has to have chemo,  rads and tamoxifen! On the flip side my hem/onc dr is wonderful!  Takes all the time I need to answer questions.  I think the breast cancer team needs a liason or navigator where I am going. Would make things easier and things would make more sense as you go along if someone was there to guide patients  through the process. Just my opinion! Glad there's groups like this to help each other along! ",

I can certainly understand the aggressive treatment.  I feel my surgeon wasn't completely forthcoming with how things could go. She was matter of fact and chemo wasn't even discussed! I was told I would have lumpectomy,  rads then tamoxifen. When the tumor came back grade 3 and Oncotype was 36 with 25% distant recurrence - it got real! I lost both of my parents to lung cancer within a 5 month time frame so your children are primary in your life and you need to take care of yourself to be there for them.  I work with Down syndrome children and they are amazing! Thank you and may you have many, many years with your precious children!  I have a 17 yr old daughter that is the light of my life so I understand! ",

Hair was the biggie for me since hubby loves long hair. Oh well guess we can't always get what we want! Can't wait to be on the other side of chemo and feeling the wind through my fuzz too! You all are an inspiration! Noonrider you and I have almost the same diagnosis and treatment. Mine was a grade 3 and Oncotype score was 36. I had the lumpectomy as well but am wondering if I should've done the mastectomy with reconstruction.  May I ask what prompted you to go that direction later? Nervous if this returns after chemo and rads that I won't be able to have recon done.  Im 45 yrs old and was blind-sided by this whole thing! Guess I'm second-guessing and looking for others viewpoints and opinions.  Thank you all so much for the photos and showing your beauty to us coming behind you!",

Lol everyone marveled at how well I could pull off this buzzed look. Not so sure about a slick bald look. Would've been better in the summer months!

I've been nauseous and tired and can't explain why it would drop. Anyone else experience this?  My fear is that my counts will be too low for chemo this friday. Any suggestions,  explanations etc. welcome!  It's all been like a huge puzzle that you go through quests to get the next clue! Lol Thanks to everyone!",
