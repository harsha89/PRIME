(dcis) The other classic was that the downstate hospital faxed the results to her office and their office girl called me on my cell phone, while I was driving, to \"just let you know, we got your results, you were right, you have cancer\". (I didn't know yet, and nearly went off the road into a corn field!). But the all time winner was from DH ex-wife: You always said you wanted bigger boobs, now you can pick your size. I wanted to hit her. Then she added, it's probably because you didn't breast feed! At that point, I looked at her and said, you breast fed, don't people say you're suppose to loose weight when you breast feed? (she's at least 50lbs. overweight!) I think I could write a book on stupid comments I've heard over the last 2 years. Sharon",

One of my co-workers couldn't believe \"you posted your fake boobs on a web site\" I tried to explain to her if it wasn't \"our sites and chats\" women who have BC would go crazy. Of course she just didn't get it, and thought it was gross. Bottom line, if she were to get BC, I would probably be her first phone call!",

I did have a problem with the SNB drain in my armpit, after 2 days without a drain I had a 1/2 grapefruite under my arm. The emergency room drained 45cc's, then another 40cc's two days later. Dr. said that the top of the drain tube may have been plugged. After that no problems. As for showering, I used an old tube top to shower in..they hold everything up close so nothing gets pulled. Good luck",
