I always felt sorrow when I would read that someone who I was conversing with passed. From time to time I have posted about my wife Ruth Ellen�s battle. The latest was to get information on Leptomeningeal Carcinoma. Well, she entered the hospital because of that on July 9th. The Methotrexate treatments were slowing it down, but it was still advancing. An MRI on August 1, show a new problem. A brain lesion that was not present on the 26th of July. We got the results on the 6th, and Ruth decided she was too exhausted to fight anymore. She entered hospice on the 7th, and came home on the 8th. Her fight ended just before midnight on the 9th (because the hospice nurse had a way to travel, the official time of death was 1:15 am on the 10th). Although there is great sorrow in knowing my beloved wife, and the best friend I�ve ever had is no longer with me, the sting is not there because I know that the moment her life ended, her mom was throwing a �Welcome Home� party for her in heaven. She has a new body, one that cannot get sick. One that will not need tests, or pokes, or ports. She�s been completely healed � permanently! Log in to post a reply",

But she is getting progressively worse. Some of her symptoms are uneasiness while walking, nausea, headaches, trouble focusing, and slurred speech. The onc ordered an MRI of the brain (last Fri). Do not have the results back, but i would not think after 3 weeks without tamoxafin, that these could be chemo related.",

I can find very little about eptomeningeal disease, or eptomeningeal cancer, and what I have found scares me to pieces. Can anyone here shed some light? Log in to post a reply",
