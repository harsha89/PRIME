      "Content": "IndigoMont11 wrote: US guided core needle biopsy this morning.  After the mammo and US last Friday, the radiologist said there were not only two areas in my left breast that were suspicious, but also a spot on a lymph node that should probably be biopsied too.  But some good news - they looked a very long time not only at the left armpit but the right one too, and then he said he was definitely not convinced there was cause for concern.  I took a breath to say I wanted to be sure and could they just biopsy the lymph node anyway, but he said again, compared to everything else he could see about all the lymph nodes I had, there was not a reason to do so.  On the other hand, after he biopsied the two spots, I asked were we trying to see if this was cancer or were we trying to find out what kind of cancer, and he said, both.  The larger approx 3 cm mass was the most suspicious one and he said that it is probably cancer.   The procedure itself was so much better than the stereotactic biopsy I had a few years ago.  Not only was it quicker and more comfortable (on my back for maybe 20 minutes instead of on my front for over an hour, but the locals didn't hurt nearly as much, and I had very little bleeding.  With the other one I had a hard time getting the bleeding stopped.    I want everyone to know that I do feel so surrounded with everyone's strength, prayers, thoughts and well wishes.  There is so much power in that!  I am feeling so much better to cope with this than I would have if not for all the support.  Hugs to all!   You are NOT alone here.
