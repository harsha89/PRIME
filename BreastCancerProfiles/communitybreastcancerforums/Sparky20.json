    "Content": "Sparky20 wrote: A small nodule mass was found during post-mammogram ultrasound. Ultrasound guided biopsy done w/ three core samples taken. Doc just called to say pathologist called results \"undiagnostic\". Dr is recommending lumpectomy or we can try biopsy again. She recommends taking the lump out bc it is small, new biopsy might not yield enough cells again, the nodule is solid, and I am over 50. Frankly, I'm not sure what is best option. I hated the biopsy, but removing the lump is more invasive. It should be conclusive, but if benign, I have permanent scar. Anyone have experience or advice? Log in to post a reply",
