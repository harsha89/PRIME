It was right in the middle of when i typically have my cycle. I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago but still pms lol. Anyways I decided to wait and see if it went away in a couple weeks in case it was just a change from cycling. Needless to say it did not go away so here I am. 2 days before my appointment I found a new lump on the opposite breast just below my armpit. I am not insured right now so I found this great women\u2019s program that covers imaging etc. So I go to my appointment today and the nurse practitioner felt the first one and said she was ordering a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound and that they would do imaging on both. I\u2019m now waiting for the office to call and schedule my tests. Waiting sucks. ",
