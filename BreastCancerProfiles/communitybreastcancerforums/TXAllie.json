But after all this I guess I should start expecting to lose my hair within the next couple of weeks :(  After having my treatment on Thur I did get out on Sat to go to the movies and try to keep active but I was really worn out by the end of the day so I wouldn't suggest you do all that.  I would just let your body tell you what it can do. My Dr told me that walking helps out with the fatigue but that just wore me out more. The first 3 or 4 day will be the toughest but after that things start looking up right when week 2 comes around. So you get about 3 good days before it starts all over..",

I was given Cytoxin & Adriamycin followed by Taxol.. I describe that time as being my 6 months in hell..  Then 9 years to the day I was dx with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer. At that time the cancer was only found on my bones and a spot on my lung. In the past 4 years I've been treated with several AI's. On March 6th I went in for my normal scans and it was found that the cancer has moved to my liver. So I am now starting Halaven. I had my 1st treatment of Halaven on Thur Mar 22. They tried to give me Decadron with Zofran but I had a bad reaction to the steroid so i will not be getting that. I've had bad nausea which started subsiding on sunday.. I'm also having bad fatigue.. which that hasn't gone away yet. And i'm still managing to work full time.  At what point did y'all notice your hair thinning or falling out?  And do y'all notice the side effects getting better as the treatment goes on or do they continue to be the same with each treatment?",

Or did it take a few months? My onc lowered my dose before I even got the med. I had been on dexamethasone and that's the same thing as decadron and had bad side effects. I was suprised she even gave it to me. Guess she wanted to just give it a try..  The reaction was just to much so I can't get it at all. Which sucks because the Zofran wears off within 24 hours of treatment.",

I am only going on my 2nd treatment and have had no signs yet of neuropathy but my onc claims the combo of these two supplements helps. But she might want to check with her onc before trying these supplements. Hope she feels better soon.. Allison",
