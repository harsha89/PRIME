Called the Onc and nurse said, \"no, can't be neulasta; you might have a kidney stone!\" so I rushed to the hospital and after four hours and urine test was neg, the ER doc called another Onc who confirmed it WAS the neulasta. Tylenol took care of it, but it was pretty scary. From then on, I took tylenol at the first sign of bone pain, which showed up about a week after each neulasta shot. I finished chemo 14 months ago, and to this day my thighs hurt from time to time.",
