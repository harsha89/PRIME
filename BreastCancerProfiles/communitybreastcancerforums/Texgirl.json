On rereading the hint I will add a few clarifying points. 1. using a very long piece of dental floss or tape..take one end and run it up under your ring..TOWARD your hand (palm). 2.begin winding the longer length from the base of your ring OUTWARD toward your knuckle..It doesn't have to be extremely tight just close together . 3. When you have gotten to the knuckle or largest part of your finger..have someone hold that end to keep from coming loose. 4. Now, take the short end that is tucked under your ring..and slowly begin unwinding ..pulling gently toward your knuckle as u do so.. going round and round your ring..it should be moving your ring down and off your finger . Hope that helps...I did it again to make sure I didn't leave anything out...it only takes a few seconds........ Letha",

Listen , discuss and plan with them your treatment.....and hit that cancer with everything in their arsenal....that they feel will benefit your situation. Pray . ( that should be in the #1 spot ) .

I must say though that most of my fears were just that....fears NOT reality.My what-ifs never happened and even the worst possibility never materialized.We sometimes can be our our own worst enemy. Always have a plan in the works.. in 2 months I will.........when I finish my first chemo..then make another plan.I will go sit at the beach when I get my rads completed... Keep that up and soon you will be done . I wish the best to all who are getting ready to take this first big step..remember you have alot of us here ready to support you along the way..you aren't alone.",

Mine occur only rarely and there is no pain associated with it. He also mentioned something about the retina at the same time..and thanks to my chemo brain I cannot remember. I do remember that if the flashing is assoc. with pain or if the vision goes black u could have a detached retina which would mean emergency situation. Perhaps this helps you...........",

I thought or would have hoped that those days were gone when women had that attitude. Much can be done today regarding cancer treatment ..you can ask the many women here who are stage IV and many yrs away from their dx. Chemo is NOT the chemo of even 10 yrs ago and is very doable even for older women.  I hope that you may convince her to continue with treatment and that you will share a long life  with her.It is NOT the end of the road for her .With regards to whether it is cancerous or not..only a biopsy will tell..not by feel nor MRI nor mammo. It has to be tested.I doubt that you would be able to get the ball rolling ,for as long as she is of sound mind would anyone go against the patient's wishes. YOu could of course enc. her to go and let the Dr. explain more in depth the situation...perhaps that would help. I wish you the best. ",
