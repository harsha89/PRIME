I started 4 rounds of AC (every 3 weeks) on December 14 which will be followed by 12 weekly doses of Taxol. I am scheduled for #3 on Thursday and I am starting to feel a little anxious. I had an appt with my oncologist last Thursday and he scheduled a MUGA scan for next month. I had one before I started and everything was fine. I am just wondering if anyone else had to have another one in the middle of treatments? I spent so much time at appt asking what I can do to manage nausea that I don't feel like I asked enough questions about this second MUGA, and now of course I can \"feel\" my heart! Did anoyone else have a MUGA between #3 and #4? Just wondering if that's standard or if onc heard something weird? Beth",
