So far so good up till the other day. I got a viralÂ  pneumonia. It started out as a sore throat , then went down into bronchial tubes..coughing yellow phlegm. Then deeper into my chest, where I could not cough up anything. After the 4th day, It was not improving. It hurt to breath deeply and easily and hurt to cough. I went to the ER. They gave me breathing treatments and IV Leviquin. They told my my immune system is not as good as it was before chemo and rads and Herceptin. They told me I have to make sure I get adequate sleep and rest when needed. Reduce stress. They said this is common when a person is worn down. But they also said that if I don't take care of this, it could go into bacterial pneumonia...They also said if it doesn't get better or it gets worse that I should be tested for blood clots in the lung. They said this is not unusual for breast cancer patients who have gone through chemo/ rads/ herceptin. I wanted to see if any women out there agree that our immunity is much lower then before chemo even after 1 year or longer? Do we always have to be careful? OneLove Log in to post a reply",
