Since chemo (coming up on 2 years), also was not able to finish chemo or herceptin because of allergies, things have gone crazy. I have always had some environmental allergies and mild asthma dx'd in adulthood, but lately it has escalated. My asthma is now 'severe', many food allergies, environmental allergies worse (triggering asthma reactions), medications (many new), and last month was stung by a bee and had an anaplylactic reaction that landed me in ICU for 2 days! My allergist/immunologist is at a loss. I am on a dozen meds now and my IGE level continues to rise (329 for a <114 norm). He is sending my records for opinions to the leading allergists in the country. I am considering Xolair use, but it is a monoclonol antibody made by the same company as Herceptin and he is unsure of any cross reactivity. I'm on the fence about trying it though, just tired of all the reactions. Because I tested so high for hymenoptera venom, he won't give me allergy shots yet. Really frustrated. So far, no one relates the chemo as a catalyst. I do, however, as I had very harsh reactions to it, i.e. febrile neutropenia, low rbc's and platelets (bottomed out to almost zero's), protracted nausea and vomiting, gallbladder disease and repeated bouts of septic shock. Having made it through all that, it's hard to accept all this stuff now. chelev- Have they pinpointed it to the chemo? I also only had 2 rounds of AC, 1+ rounds of TCH, and then a few more of H alone before they said I could not do any more. Glad to see this topic open again, I feel that I am not such a minority!",

I emphatically stated it was not sepsis and only need fluids and pain meds (can only use Fentenyl) and what would happen through the night. Boy the ER dr was not happy at all! I was lectured about only treating 1/2 my disease and how foolish I was being. I explained that this happens every Tuesday and past work-ups were negative for infection, so on and so forth. I said I was leaving and he wrote in BOLD that I was leaving the ER without adequate treatment and against his better judgement. I am already tired of this.

I have ascites from the liver that started last weekend, so I think the vomiting yesterday was my body getting rid of all the excess fluid that my kidneys can't process. No vomiting today. The nausea is always there from the liver tumors, but keeping something in my stomach helps. Today the ascites is much better, so the above makes sense. I am able to hydrate well enough, as I walk a fine line between renal failure and overhydration. I will talk to the MO if I have another appointment before the next infusion. I feel pretty good today! I'll get the papain tabs today. Momonana6- I do not know if benadryl is common. I always get it as I was allergic to Herceptin. I also get Solu-Medrol and pepcid a hour before the infusion. The Kadcyla is also administered very slowly (last time over 16 hours) and the MO wants to try and do it faster this time with less volume. All in all, I had 300 mg of benadryl both days last time and two doses of Solu-Medrol, pepcid, Aloxi and Zofran. I would ask your Dr about the last reaction and suggest that your receive benadryl if they feel it's warranted. Sometimes they do not have (or read about) the past reactions. Fortunately, my Dr's are well aware of my numerous reactions to meds and tend to very overly cautious. Can anyone tell me what nueropathy feels like when it starts? My palms are tingling/itching. My feet are less so. Thank you all for your advice!",

They checked with other infusion centers and they also refused. The only infusion I have done was over two days, the first from 7a-6p and the next day 11a- 6p. Then ended up the next day in the hospital with a medication reaction that they thought I was septic with. Wasn't thankfully, just a response. For that reason, they are refusing as there is no one-to-one pharmacist and no dedicated dr on Saturdays. I am in a 6 week intensive training class and am not allowed to miss any days (short of dying, I guess) so I am really stuck. Once I am out of this class, I can do the infusion on Monday's. I explained this to them that it would be maybe just this one, as the next would be only a few days late. They are concerned that if I have a reaction, no one is there. Doesn't make any sense to me as I am two floors above the ER! If I have to wait seven weeks, I guess it is a moot point as the MO told me that I did not have that time to play with after my PET scan revealed such wide spread mets, and she wanted to start treatment in a couple days. I am hoping to talk with the MO this week and see if the time for infusion can be shortened and spread over a couple afternoons. Guess we will see. Have a great weekend everyone! We finally got some rain in the CA foothills last night. It is really nice to see some finally. -Moni",

While in the ER I asked the doc if the scan had been read yet. He pulled it up and said he was very sorry, but that it showed extensive liver mets over 50% of the right lobe and extension to the left with portal invasion. Also some local lymph nodes enlarged. I was admitted to the hospital and my MO saw me the next day. She scheduled a liver biopsy, right breast biopsy and a port installation for Friday. FYI- do not do all that in one day!!!! Hell of a night. I was not a compliant patient that night! Will be starting Kadcyla next week and have a PET scan on Wednesday. My prognosis is not good. I am hoping to make it until my youngest son graduates from high school in 20 mo. and my MO said she would treat me aggressively. Guess I will go to the stage 4 boards. I wish you all well. My TM's were accurate. I had a 30 pt jump earlier this years, but it was disregarded. Should have insisted on scans.",

She is leaning toward first though with a flip-flop. I explained the need to not miss work for 6 weeks and could we wait. She said no, I do not have that time. She wants to start chemo on 9/29.

She conveyed the urgency of treatment, but not specifically why. I now know why: so many lymph nodes from supraclavicular to groin gave up tallying, met to left lower lung lobe, over 75% of the liver has been replaced by tumor. And to top it all off, the MO's request for and emergency drug approval is not happening that fast. I will have to sign a letter of being responsible for the Kadcyla infusion on Tuesday! The MO's office feels it will be approved, but not by Tuesday. Not sure how much more I can fit on my plate. Feeling a little hopeless tonight.",

Although I had only two nodes removed (my demand to only do two) I have not had any trouble with staff members respecting the 'not on the left side' request. Although I do not have LE, I also want to do everything to avoid it. One lab person said she would absolutely try everything possible to avoid using the left (difficult stick) even after the 6th stick when I was wavering! I also have adhesive, plastic, latex, etc. allergies, and frequently on steroids which make your veins blow easily,  that people have worked around. Every time I have been in the hospital, a big sign would be taped over the head of the bed and no one had a problem with it. For my practice, I go with what the patient says, hands down, no question. I'm sorry to hear of others having so much difficulty. I say advocate for yourselves!  In the end, you have to live with the results, not them. I also use the opportunity to teach about LE if they ask. Never had anyone resent that, most have not heard of it, although I think more people are becoming aware.",

I am seeing the Dr today, Not sure if she will change anything yet, but my TM's are no longer decreasing, just kinda holding as are the liver enzymes so I am not sure the Kadcyla is working anyway. I am also having continued liver pain, not usually bad just annoying. Glad that combo is working for you! I am going to ask. Moni",

More than 75% involvement in my liver, one in L lung, R breast and so many lymph nodes I lost count. Saw my MO in March and she found nothing. I found the breast lump in August and was scanned to find the rest in September. I did have liver pain and enlargement that I could palpate. The pain was exactly where Golden's mom describes it, and also had the fullness and bloating that she describes. I went to my PCP and she said I had lost 10 pounds since I last saw her. I have since lost 5 more without trying. I am not overweight and realized pants fitting looser, but abd girth seemed to not change. I believe it was there since a small spike in TM's in January. Anyway, I was interested in Woodylb comment about the first line being Kadcyla, as this is the drug my MO chose to start me with also. As I see in jnh's profile, she has rec'd a taxol (taxotere) for the original treatment. That was my original also, so I was told by my MO that was why she chose Kadcyla. I have had two tx's with Kadcyla and so far I cannot tell if it is working. She has said nothing about rescanning. When should that be done? And how long should this drug be given? I keep forgetting to ask this stuff. I do not feel a difference in the breast tumor. The liver enzymes initially dipped but my ALT is 958 now. TM's were down to 1650 from 2059 with the first infusion. Because of the liver pain, I am meeting with a pain specialist to be considered for an implanted fentanyl pump as I am allergic to all other opiod pain meds. Wishing everyone a good weekend. Any input would be appreciated.",

Dr thought it was do to tumor lysing since my tumor burden is so much. I got my CA 27-29 from yesterday and it was 1775. Will be interested what it is next week. Not really noticed any other SE's yet other than my liver has stopped hurting it I don't touch it. That is great. Was really having a problem with that. Momonana6- Good luck with Kadcyla. So far this is the best chemo I have had. Hope it stays that way. I do have some nausea, but I had that before from the liver issue. ",

I also get solu-medrol multiple times during the infusion and sometimes max out on the benadryl (300 mg). All of this is because of an allergy to herceptin. I still have a reaction and fever the day after. My MO is changing the way we do it and I am going to a weekly dose of 80mg over 6 hrs. to see if I can tolerate it better. Really like having the week before the infusion when I feel good and can forget for that time, but being in hospital after every infusion is not good either. Wish you the best.",

The good thing is I could fit in pants today! Now I only look 5 mo pregnant. I am going to try pepcid tonight and see if that helps. It really does not seem to matter what I eat (don't eat spicy foods anyway) and I will try the papain tabs this weekend. My TM's have gone up to 2058 and the liver enzymes are ASP 957, AST 268 ALT 478. I know this could be the tumor lysing can elevate them, so not panicking just yet. I have weekly draws.

I was not increasing my chances of lymphedema more that I had to. There have been studies confirming this route now, but at the time it was very new.
