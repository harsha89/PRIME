I live in New Zealand so some of the drugs and stuff you talk about I don't get but I follow most of your stuff. I had round 2 on Monday and have felt like I have been hit by a bus! My first round was pretty easy and stupidly thought this one would be too. I ake from top to toe lyterally. My scalp really hurts this week, thought that would settle after I shaved it by no! I have been really lucky with the nausia, the drugs they give me are great, I was really worried as I thought if you get bad car sickness you get bad chemo sickness, but I have had none. I have 3 kids all home for the Christmas school hols and I am exausted getting from my bed to a chair let alone takeing them anywhere. We have been very blessed with lots of support meals etc but I would love someone to come and take all 3 kids for a couple of days! Looking forward to sharing your journey ladies thanks for sharing xx",

There has always been someone around and my first surgery was only 2 weeks after I was diagnosed so it has been a really crazy time. Anyway I wore a scarf, wig way too itchy, and was very aware of prople moving out of my way as I came down the isle. It could have been my imagination but I dont think so. The other thing that I was very aware of was the lack of eye contact. Ususally especially when people move out of your way they will make eye contact, maybe give you a smile. Not this time. But it wasn't them not making eye contat with me that struck me. I started thinking about me in the same situation, seeing someone in a wheel chair, a little person, someone with a disfigurement, and realised that I do the same thing, not because I'm embaresed fjor them but don't want them to feel like I'm stairing at them. I will be treating people differently from now on. I will be making an extra effort to make eye contact and smile at Everyone. Rant over Anniebel: My Scalp was really itchy and sore this round #2, but has settled heaps in last couple of days, still a little read and splotchie and have a few small spots at the base of the back but heaps better. I dont wear my wig much drives me nuts too itchy, I'm just rocking my scarves. I have decided my new phrase is 'I am ok today\" you just never know how you are going to be tomorrow and saying I'm ok this week is so wrong. My mum has even stopped ringing me, she texts every day, but she doesn't want to upset me and I have cried one too many times on the phone. I know she is doning it with the best of intentions but... Someone sugested I put up a sign..'Today I am feeling.....' So the kids and husband and anyone else visiting can see at a glance how things are going, getting to the point that I might do it. My beach is Buckland Beach or Eastern Beach, Auckland, New Zealand. You might need to Google it. Beautiful Spot to live. Never snows here, not sure what the conversian is but we are in the late 20'C sometimes into the 30'C. Loving that I am doing this int he summer less bugs to worry about. Ok rant over off to bake for my visitors, and have my 2 min shower, no hair to wash or shave saves time ;) Loulabell",

Often the kids dont. I wish I could scream and shout and spit out the medicine when I don't want it though. I DON\"T WANT TO DO THIS!!! But I know I have to.Big Sigh! CCK - I so relate to the sister thing. Mine rang the night before my first opp (partial mastectomy) and we argued over weather breast cancer was hereditory or not! She has spoken to someone who 'knew'! I have not spoken in person to her since, can not get my head around the fact that my only sister has not sent a card or called in 3 months. I have gone from a stage 1 small tumor and partial mastectomy to a full mastectomy and tramflap, grade 2 spreading bla bla bla and she has not even picked up the phone. I was the one to initiate contact when she went in for a dnc to help stop bleeding last week, sent a few texts to see how she was hoped she was ok. (She didn't even do that when I was in hospital for 6 days after a major 6 hr surgery). Figured if I text I wont say something I regret, then ended up with the whole, you should go for a pink, blue or green wig. And she thought she had the right....Ok going to stop ranting now just needed to get that out and anyone I rant at here keeps trying to make me feel better and do the right thing and flag it I have cancer and I don't want to do the right thing...but I know I will because that is just who I am. Well I'm day 12 Treadtmet #2, Have had a great week, mouth has been yuck, but had heaps of energy, seen a few friends, but now thinking I might have pushed it a bit much. My jaw and face is acky and I'm feeling shattered again. Hope to be brighter tomorrow have the Look good feel better day to go to. I hear it is really good. Blessings to you all thanks for letting me rant, seems to be a week of it, off to try the olive oil mouth wash. Lou",

It is hard after having my tranflap to figure out sometimes if things like the back pain are related to that. ANNIE; I too was told that if the nausia is not under control they are not doing their job, I was really worried about the nausia, give me pain any day just dont make me sick! I have had no nausia at all...touch wood...I do get a little queezy like morning sickness and just eating something (if I can find something that tastes ok) helps. I have even started doing dry crackers, how's that for morning sicness memories. I figure it is sometimes the empty stomach that makes me feel off. ERICA; hope all went well with round #1, I didn't do chemo classes either, I'm going through the 'Private' system here and they are not as busy so just sit us down with the nurse and go through the stuff, what when where how....then on the day they asked us to come early so we could meet with a couple of ladies who were doing their 3rd round. was a bit bizzar being sat infront of them and being told to ask anything we want while they were being pumped with chemo. Only thing we asked was were you sick and when did your hair fall out. Their answers were pretty much what we had been told anyway. Well I had my #2 Monday last week, felt so exausted until Sat then it was like a cloud lifted, I now feel fabulous, even baked cookes with the kids yesterday and then got out the royal icing to decorate them and wow they look fabulous. Baking is my thing I love craft of any sort and have not done any since I was diagnosed, I even run a craft business which has gone on hold since October. I just can not get my brain in the right space, so it was like a new lease on life doing my cookies yesterday. As they say it is the little things in life that keep you going, oh how true that is becoming now. Stay strong ladies, remember to look forward not back, if I start thinking about how I felt last week I crumble, so I am focusing on this week I feel great!!!!! PS: WAVE you need to pop over here, I will find you a bed, we are at the peak of Summer, the beach is only a 5 min walk and it is lovely. I even went for a swim in the sea on Sunday, Kept a cap on my head so not to scare anyone. Just have to remember that I burn easier so can't sit in the sun too long, don't like to do that anyway. Sunshine sure makes this easier to bear!",

Mentiond this to my onc and he has given me anti inflamatories. I don't know if it was them or not but they say then energy levels are supposed to be acumalitive and I'm ok, really struggling with loss of stregenth, evening opening some bottles, or lifting things out of the car. I know most of you are in winter but has anyone else been sunburnt. I got burnt really bad on back of my neck, I havn't been out in the sun! Only time I can think of is when i dropped my son at sports and spoke to a friend for about half hour, but it was 6pm. Back of neck is purple/red looks horrible. i knew you were more likely to get sun burnt but this is rediculous! I still have some eyelashes and eyebrows but they are thinning. Has anyone looked at fulse lashes? Had a few reccomend them, the good ones can last 3+weeks. Excuse the bad spelling, can't spell for peanuts and chemo brain is making it worse;)",

I did round 2 on Jan 9th and it was really hard much worse than round 1 but it only lasted one week, since then I have felt really good, a few akes in my legs and jaw but nothing much. I prefer it from round one as I had 2 weeks feeling off and only one good one. I can deal with one bad week if I am going to have 2 good weeks. I am a bit nervous about round 2 as it is the week the kids head back to school. My girls are ok getting themselves sorted but Dylan is 8 and needs sorting. Going to head up to school this week and talk to his teacher and deliver his books so at least that is organised. Anyone else having runny eyes, aside from the crying ;) My eyes seem to be leeking all the time. Have you girls had surgery? We have our surgery before we do 'treatment' but I saw a post earliser from someone who is having surgery post chemo? Thank you for sharing your journeys always so good to know we are not alone.",

Yeah, wont mind having one Mack Truck week if I can have 2 good ones. Had round 3 yesterday, got really emotional, my husband usually comes with me but he had work commitments and most of my girlfirends are either back at work or have young kids, so I went on my own. Was ok once he left think it was the thought of him leaving that set me off. Was ar really nice bunch there yesterday very chatty. really threw me that the 2 other ladies on CT were back for their secound round. I'm only planning on doing this once!! They were all talking about chemo brain, knowing exactly what you want to say but having no idea what it is called!! So frustrating but funny at the same time. Kids start school tomorrow YEAH but have a few jobs that need doing today. Heading off now, feeling ok so far but know it is coming, hope I can get all my jobs done before it does. My friend is using fizzy drink instead of the Olive oil mouth wash, not using the fizzy drink as a mouth wash just drinking heaps in the first few days after treatment. She has found the mouth thing isn't so bad and goes away quicker. Worth a try I say. Thinking of you girls off for your treatments this week. I know for me it is the 1st of Feb and I will be finished by the end of Feb!!!",
