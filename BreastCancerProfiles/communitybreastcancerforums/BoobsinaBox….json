I hope someone with more knowledge of these things will be along to help soon.  Best wshes for finding a solution you can live with happily. Dawn",

I later realized I have stage 0 LE, which means the swelling is not large and it seems to go away after treatment (MLD, lots of water, elevation, sleeves and wearing the sleeves and gloves during the day). I got the prescription and went to a fitter and was measured. Almost everything I know about LE I learned here, and much of it comes from reading every thread every day. I have been doing that since I discovered a year after my surgery that my surgeon had removed 12 nodes on the left and 9 on the right, despite having told me he \"only removed one or two with the breast tissue\". This LE board is where I learned how to care for myself, before I got an LE therapist. I recommend reading it thoroughly! Good luck with getting the garments you need!",

Quite a few of us have found our new selves to be happy most or all the time without forms of any kind.  I hope you can return the expensive ones, and if you decide you want something, check out Barbara's non-profit website BreastFree.org.  There are much less expensive alternatives!

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2010 02:19AM - edited Apr 4, 2010 02:32AM by BoobsinaBox Barbara:  I was thinking about the PALs also.  I liked the small ones, which I could wear in a camisole, but they had slightly more projection than I wanted and a too small footprint, so they tended to gravitate toward each other, which means I was always having to sneak off to straighten them out.  I liked having them against my skin, and I think the oil helped my scars get better.  I ordered the next size up, which had the footprint I wanted, but they had even more projection, and they were too heavy to stay comfortably in my camisoles, so I had to use a bra, and I still can't find a bra that a) doesn't ride up (because my ribs are so prominent below the bra line) and b) doesn't irritate my left side, where the worst nerve damage was done.  I tended to take both of them on every trip, which meant bras and camisoles and forms filling the suitcase!  It is sooooooooooo nice not to have to worry about those things. Also, I guess, because I told everyone about my bc and bilat, and because I went form-free for 6 months before trying any forms, everyone was accustomed to how I looked...then I sprouted boobs!  I felt embarrassed to have them, and I found that because of the weight and the embarrassment, I found myself slumping and turning my shoulders in.  I know I could have gotten over that, but I had those other reasons for not wanting to be bothered with forms.  And finally, the thing that has made this bc journey redeemable for me has been that because people know my story, they send people to me when they get their diagnosis.  Being able to offer people an understanding ear is worth it.  I know they still could do that, but frankly, I am not ashamed of my shape, and I don't want newbies to think I am.  I know you aren't either, and I don't mean anyone else is.  I just want women to see that there is real and fulfilling life after bc, with or without forms.  Does any of that make sense? Thanks for asking.  You have made a similar (and more far-reaching) contribution with your website, and I will be forever grateful for it!  I still haul out the Comfort-lites occasionally, but they are bigger than my small PALs, and don't feel as much like my old me as the PALs did.   Seeing the Wardrobe pics for Boobless Days thread of all the other women who looked so fantastic in their form-free-ness is what helped me remember how much I liked the freedom, and realize that I could look just fine without the forms.  I credit them for helping me get back to being form free.  And yes, I still get out the forms and wear them occasionally, but it usually doesn't last more than a couple of hours.  I'm just happier without.

My chest is much happier now, and I feel much less vulnerable than I did with nothing between my ribs and the outside world but a piece of cloth!  They are small, however, so I don't feel like I am projecting too much.  I would have liked the flat look, if I could have just been flat, instead of concave and uneven.  You can see what Pals look like on Barbara's non-profit website BreastFree.org, and also get ideas about a variety of other options.  Good luck with your search.

I keep switching back and forth between them every few months.  I don't like to switch during the day...too hard on my self-image...who is that woman in the mirror?  Im starting to think I feel better without forms in the winter when I wear more jackets, and with forms in the summer with my chest is more noticeable.  This is counter to the wisdom that the forms help keep one warmer in winter and make one hot in summer.  Can't win them all.  Dawn ",

Also, though my surgeon wanted to do lump & rads, I persisted, partly because I was terrified of rads, mostly due to my very fair skin and because my best friend was beginning rads and had told me about the dangers to heart and lungs, and so on.  The surgeon really didn't want to do the bilat, but he did agree to do it.  He proved, however, to be a real jerk, telling me that he didn't remove axillary lymph nodes (path report showed 12 on L and 9 on R!), that he hadn't caused the terrible nerve pain I had for months, and objecting to my having Physical Therapy, even after I came back for follow-up visits with much improvement.  In fact, I fired him the last time, after he told me, \"Frankly, my patients don't need physical therapy!\"  I'm not a suer either, but I detest that man!  Anyhow, after seeing your picture of rads burns, I am even more thankful that I had the bilat.  My only regret in the whole process has been that I didn't look for another surgeon after he was so obnoxious about doing it in the first place.  My friend suggested that I come here, but I didn't have the energy until almost 11 months after my surgery.  When I got here, I found, as you have, some amazing support, and I am grateful for your post.  There don't seem to be many of us who don't wear prostheses a lot.  I got a pair, but I never felt very good in them, and I found that I had to keep adjusting to the way I looked when I took them off.  I am still trying to invent my own little prostheses (the fitter insisted that I needed to get the same size I had been before surgery, which was bigger than I wanted to be).  I am concave, more on the left than right, so I'd just like to sort of fill that in and make a very small mound, if I can find a way to do it... and that's just for when I dress up!  Around the house I'm perfectly content.  And I'd rather go with nothing everywhere than have the discomfort of a bra and those heavy prostheses!  I've been going \"natural\" for most of the last 18 months.  I guess I get wound up when I talk about this.  I'd love to see the prosthesis you made.  Could you post a picture and/or instructions?  I've tried crocheting and am now ready to try sewing.

He was furious and rude, but when the nurse was unsuccessful 3 times getting the IV started in my feet, he did come in and put the needle in with no trouble and very little pain.  You will have to have your doctor write on the Lab order, that the blood draw must come from the foot, or they can't do it, but once your doctor understands that (and you may need to remind them every time), it can be done.  One doctor sent me to the hospital for my draw, thinking they would be more experienced.  I got a first-timer, and she did a great job.  But my regular lab has always has one or two people with experience.  You have more than enough on your plate with cancer.  These are very good questions, and all of us who have bilats either ask them or wait for someone else to. Keep up the good fight! Dawn ",

My DH would be happier if I could just put the whole experience behind me, but I can't, and I don't really want to.  I'm glad my new normal includes being as supportive as I can of anyone I meet who is faced with the terrible choices we've all had to make.  There are no perfect, one-size-fits-all answers, so we have to make the decisions that fit us best...for as long as they fit us.  It has taken me a while to get here. Michele, you will get to a more peaceful place one of these days.  Give yourself more time, and know we'll be here for you all the way.   Dawn ",

DiDel, I can't take Benedryl, but I have doubled my generic Zyrtec. I'm in Indianapolis area, so if anyone here has recommendations about a good LE therapist (or doctor who understands LE) I'm open to hearing about it!  Feel free to PM me, if you have info, anyone.    The itching is better at the moment, so I am hoping things will settle down soon.I can actually see some wrinkles in my arms now (thicker than usual), which I couldn't earlier, so that is encouraging. Thanks again for your responses and help.  If I hadn't had all of you on my team for the past 4 years, I'd be a basket case.  As it is, I'm just a case!   Dawn ",

It's not showing my face that's an issue for me.  I am reluctant to put pictures on Facebook or other social networking sites, and I don't really understand Photobucket, but I have been reluctant also to use online photo storage.  I do some semi-pro photography, and I don't want to have my work stolen.  Please know that I don't consider photos of me flat-chested something anyone would want to steal!  HA!  It's just the means of getting the photos here that I have concern about.  If I can ever get my questions answered to my satisfaction, I'd love to put up a few pictures!  I actually liked the outfit I wore last night enough that I almost had my DH take a picture I could send to someone else to put on.  Okay, I'm also shy.  I have longish grey hair (growing out to an as-yet undetermined style) and I still want to lost 15 pounds, neither of which will make me look as young and beautiful as others who have posted, anyhow, but there you are.  Thanks for your encouragement.  I know that if only the small, young, beautiful ones post pictures, the rest of us will never get our courage up!  Still, I don't want this thread to die.  It has given me so much hope and encouragement.

Others found theirs with prostheses. You will make the best decision for you after you find some peace for yourself.  Meanwhile, don't let anyone, including me, tell you what to do!  You have a good head on your shoulders, and I trust you to use it for your own best interests.

I generally wear either the larger SCLs or the smaller PALs, but today I got out the originals, and remembered that they are heavy, but they do feel a lot more like my original equipment.  I also have gone totally flat (concave) for about half of the 5 and a half years since my bilat.  In short, I probably won't ever find the perfect foobs for me, but I have lots of options in my closet, and I hope your first prosthesis truly is the best one for you.  Just don't be surprised if you find yourself looking for other options over the years!  Good luck!

Well, yes, PALs are the perkiest for sure, but when it comes to the hug test, silicone can't be beat.  Since I've been wearing forms again daily (about 9 months), I'm having some nerve pain on the left side.  It doesn't seem to matter which bra or forms I wear, the burning sensation is the same.  I hadn't been having any trouble until the past few months, so I'm not sure what the problem is.  It's not awful, and I have a pretty high pain threshhold, so I'm not ready to stop wearing them, but I do go without sometimes at home, just to get a rest.  My natural shape in the old days was always bigger on top than on the bottom (and very dense), so these droopy forms don't look natural to me.

I don't know that there is one simple answer to your question about why back to flat (or concave), but I'll try to answer concisely anyhow.  For the past few months, as this subject got more attention on this board, and as more and more women talked about how freeing it was to go form free, I kept remembering just how free I had felt that first almost 2 years.  I am doing one thing different this time around.  Because I am concave on the left side, I have been wearing some cute little camisoles I bought just before I bought my PALs last year.  They came from Wal-Mart, and they have very thin pads in the cups of the cami (to hide nipples?), which project maybe a half inch or maybe an inch on the concave side.  If I run my hand over them, they crush against my chest, but they come right back out when I let go of them.  This helps my chest look more like Cathi's than concave, and I think that helps. I'm not quite ready to wear those adorable dresses Cathi has on in her pics, but that's more because my whole professional life, I had to dress quite conservatively, and I still feel too shy to wear things I love to see on other people.  Does that make sense?  At any rate, the freedom is wonderful, and I love getting up and getting dressed without having to figure out which forms and which bra or cami and wondering if people notice that I seem softer and larger some days and smaller and firmer on other days.  I still haven't a clue what people feel when they hug me!  And I get a lot of hugs.   As long as I stand up straight and hold my tummy in, I think I look about 10  pounds lighter without the forms, even though they don't even weigh an extra two pounds total!  I do like the flatter look.  One problem with forms is that most of them have more projection than I want. These little camis seem to give me all I want, and they don't move around or threaten to show themselves!  That's not concise, but does it get at answering your question?  I feel sure once you try it and get used to it, you are gonna love it.  You are petite enough to look smashing, athletic, and very hot!  Now, if I can lose that last pesky 15 pounds, maybe I will too...  Dawn ",

She taught me MLD (I do it every night), said I was stage 0 (I would wear my sleeves and gloves whenever I had to do heavy work or felt that heavy, slightly achy feeling, but it would then go away fairly quickly.) I postponed the surgery, as I needed to move out of state.  Maybe next year, if I find another good surgeon. NOW...All that is changing this week.  I developed a rash on Tuesday night (I believe due to strawberries, though not positive), first on one patch on my arm, then on the whole L arm, then the R arm.  Next morning it was on both legs, and finally on chest and abdomen.  Can you say ITCH???  I thought doing MLD was a bad idea, as it made the itching worse to rub it; I've been drinking lots of water; deep breathing; checking my skin \"wrinkles\".  (Surely LE has to be the only reason any woman ever wanted wrinkly skin!!!)  This morning, there are no wrinkles.  The rash is much better on my legs and abdomen.  Arms still itch constantly.  I've used Caladryl, Lanacane, and Hydrocort cream, each applied with upward sweeps, and each somewhat effective in their own turn.   I haven't been wearing my sleeves and gloves, and now I wonder if I should or not.  I have no doctor or therapist or anyone here to see, and we all know ERs don't seem to know anything about LE.  I'm turning to my gurus here for advice.   Dawn  Log in to post a reply",

Over the next year I bought new clothes without darts.  I still only buy things that way, and there are lots of options.  I started online with Coldwater Creek Outlet, and bought a lot of travel knits on sale.  Anyhow, I think what was best for me was when I got the size 2 microbead forms and wore them all the time for about 4-5 months.   They got rid of the sunken areas (worst on the left) and yet they didn't look like I was trying to have big boobs.  I wasn't self-conscious in them, and I had been in everything else.  After wearing them for several months, one day I just took them off, and now I don't feel self-conscious any more without foobs.  I don't know if it was the time elapsed of 4 1/2 years or the more gradual adjustment to being really flat.  All I know is that now I'm not self-conscious any more.  I really don't think about it much at all now, which I didn't think I'd ever be able to say.   I do know it is a process, and it differs for each of us.  I am very grateful to be where I am today, and I trust that your process will lead you to a peaceful resolution to wherever you need to be...with or without foobs.  I will note that when I was wearing foobs, I generally wore them day and night, because the hardest thing of all for me was changing!  Having boobs when I looked in the mirror one time and not the next. It was awful for me.   Dawn ",

(I was told in 2002 that I would need surgery, but I put it off...then I was too scared to do it after my bilat.)  I visited the surgeon last week, and he assured me that I am 100% at risk for LE (which helped my dh realize that I have not been overreacting!), and he got me an appointment with a well-qualified (Vodder method) LE therapist.  They called yesterday with a cancellation, and I went!  It was so helpful.  I have 5 more visits set up to learn MLD (my dh will go too), and she did a thorough measurement of both hands and arms and checked my sleeves (I haven't used them much so they are still good and the right size) and we decided that a gauntlet would probably be enough for now, so she is ordering me gauntlets, which will make it a lot easier for me to wear all the gear.  Those gloves were overkill, and were dirty within minutes of putting them on.)  And she assured me that the risks of the surgery (which are significant) are offset by the risks of the pain issues I've had for many years.  She said to go ahead with the surgery, and we'll take care of any swelling or problems, if and when the time comes.   She was very impressed with how much I have learned from this site, and I want to thank all you knowledgeable folks for being my therapist up until now!  After having doctors who didn't believe in LE and wouldn't get me into therapy, I have finally found doctors who take my concerns seriously and am getting the tools I need to stay safe and take care of myself!  I can't tell you how much you all mean to me, whether you ask questions I didn't know to ask or answer them with such wisdom, compassion, and humor!  This site has kept me sane, and now that I have my LE Stage 0 diagnosis and a therapist I can trust and call on, and a dh who is realizing I wasn't making things worse by spending time here every day, I am so relieved. Everybody wants us to go back to being who we were before BC and LE, but they really don't understand. You all have been my sanity, and I thank you so very much.  Now, I have some more reading to do (she gave me a bunch of literature) and soon I will have exercises and tools.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I went form free in the beginning because it was two years before I could stand to have anything like elastic (in shelf bras in camis) or anything other than cotton next to my chest.  I had a lot of nerve pain, and while it is mostly now just numbness, I still have a lot of it, and I have to be careful not to do myself damage when I don't realize it.  I wore cotton tank tops as a base garment or as underwear under everything in that time, and I wore a LOT of black, especially travel knits that are such a deep black there is no shadow.  (I LOVE black, so that was not a problem for me.)  Eventually I branched out into purple, turquoise, and some copper/gold, but black was and is my staple.  (I could wear that gorgeous black dress of Cathi's and feel very good about myself.)   I've told you before that changing from forms to flat and back again is both physically and psychologically painful for me.  I was fine if all I wore was PALs because I wore them 24/7 (except in the shower), but when I got the comfort of the Comfort-Lites and had to change into the PALs at night, it got complicated, and then I couldn't find a bra that was comfortable for long, and then this thread came along and reminded me just how much free-er I felt when I didn't have to think about it all that much.   As I've noted, until I quit working last year in June, I was mostly is dressy clothes with jackets or scarves to camoflage my flatness some, and I was mostly indoors with A/C which was often cool enough for a jacket anyhow.  But then at home, in shorts and T-shirts and so on, I began to look for options.  At any rate, I found I was so used to being flat (and everyone I worked with and pretty much everyone I knew, knew I'd had BC and a bilat.) so I didn't think about it much.  Then I suddenly sprouted boobs, and the looks of surprise on people's faces (even brief ones) made me self-conscious, and I began to curve my shoulders forward just a bit, and stand less straight.  I know it is counter-intuitive, but I do stand and sit more straight, when I am form-free than when I look like I have breasts.  So I am enjoying once again being form-free, liking the way I look slenderer and have better posture.  Sure, I have some clothes that look better with some shape, but I have mostly a wardrobe without darts and shaping, and I am mostly comfortable with it.   A good friend sent me a T-shirt (in my favorite black) that says, \"Cancer Sucks!\"  I wore it to the Y a few times, and people wanted to know where to get one for other people they knew who'd had cancer.  And because I had been so open about my diagnosis and treatment, women came to me from all over when they got their diagnoses.  Only one of them made the decisions I had made, but they all stay in touch and let me know how they are doing.  And the one who was fairly heavy and went form-free looked fabulous when I saw her a few months later in a dress and little jacket.  I had to look twice to be know she didn't have on forms, and she looked slimmer as well.  But it was the pictures on this site that convinced me that I could still look and feel feminine and sexy without boobs.  I felt all right before, but I didn't think I LOOKED sexy, and now I know it really isn't what's on top of my chest, but what's in my head!   So thanks to all who have posted pictures and shared your stories.  I'm beginning to feel both sexy and free again, and that is no small feat.

I also find that I don't notice the tight feeling all the time any more, but it just shows up mostly when I don't have something snug on.    I tended to take two sets of boobs on trips too, and it does take a LOT of room!  And the more sets I bought, the harder my decision was about which ones to take!   I LOVE not having to go through all that. I am really quite comfortable in most of my clothes, even though I am flat or concave.  I really don't think very many people are paying attention.   After my first aqua aerobics class last week, I was telling the instructor about my bilat and my concerns about LE, and another woman was standing by waiting to talk to her too, I thought. Actually she ended up talking to me, as she'd had a mast and reconstruction 11 years ago.  It seems like every time I am open with others about my surgery, then people open up to me.  That is another plus to not wearing the forms.  I've met some wonderful people, helped some of them, and been helped by others.  I wouldn't have chosen to join this sorority, but since I had to, I find it is certainly full of wonderful people!

I discovered that I had what my dad called his \"lower chest muscle\" after my bilat.  I hadn't seen it before.  It motivated me to get back to the Y, which worked to get me a little flatter, but I still have a major lower rib on the left and a good sized one on the right.  Or maybe the left just looks bigger because of the concave area above it.  Anyhow, I really worked on my posture and stood up very straight.  After I got forms, I began to slump again.  I don't know why.  Now I'm working on getting myself back up straight, with the big smile to pull their eyes up! Cathi, those are fabulous dresses - on you!  This is the thread I was waiting for, I guess! Dawn ",

Thank you so much for the picture of your mother-in-law!  That's a casual version of the way I dressed before when I was not using prostheses.   She was beautiful, and I would never have known from that picture that she wasn't just small-breasted.  I had a jacket from Coldwater Creek in that style and it was my favorite!  I guess it still is.  At any rate, to have had the issues she had for so many years, and to have maintained that wonderful smile and so much class...Wow!  What an amazing woman! I think she is my heroine, too. Dawn ",

I take Aleve for arthritis in my hands.  It doesn't overcome the pain, but it makes it bearable.  I will be having surgery on my dominant hand in the next few months, followed by 6 months recovery, then surgery on the non-dominant hand.  No one else would send me to LE therapist, but the hand surgeon said he wouldn't do surgery until I had learned MLD and appropriate exercises, because my risk for LE is already high and will be even higher with the surgery he will do.  I am getting training now from a Vodder trained therapist.  She has been very impressed with what I knew about LE and how quickly I am learning to do the massage.  My husband has also amazed her with his gentle touch, and all of this is because of the support and knowledge I have gained here on this board in the past 3 years.  If I had had to deal with this 4 years ago, I might still be a basket case!   Dawn ",

My LE therapist had me keep my clothes on and learn to massage through them, though I find it easier to do my own MLD on bare arms and abdomen.  It was a very respectful process.    Dawn ",

Barbara, Thanks for including the website here.  I've been thinking about these for some time, and while I am still very happy with my small PALs, I think the combo of silicone and beads would make a nice look and feel (for me on the inside and for the passing the hug test).   Dawn ",

I thought they couldn't possibly be big enough to do any good, but they are just what I wanted.  I may make a trip to the Breast Center where I was told 4 years ago in no uncertain terms that anything smaller than a 5 in the silicone triangle would be much too small, and I should get a 6.  I got the 5s and hardly wore them.  I've been self-conscious in every other form I've had, but these just feel like me.   I do plan to wear these all the time, so having two pairs is essential to keep them clean! May even get another pair or two, as time goes by. Dawn ",
