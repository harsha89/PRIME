Day 3 Tx 1 was pretty uneventful except I suffered a brief bout of constipation, then the exact opposite, accompanied by a nasty burning sensation. I'm grateful for the chemo purchase list thread that suggested getting baby wipes. That's all I'm going to say about that. No nausea yesterday, thank goodness. I did my two daily walks with the dog, and ate fairly well. I had a slight sour taste in my mouth for most of the day, so some foods did not appeal. Fruit was fine, saltines were heavenly, and country chicken & brown rice soup really hit the spot. I'm being very diligent but gentle with my mouth care, and so far, no sores. Hope everyone else is doing well.",

Coming with me to treatments makes him feel like he's doing something constructive. So, I let him. :-) My onc said I would most likely be able to drive home afterwards--and after my tx, I certainly felt alert and capable.

I think the waiting is the hardest part. I'm 2 weeks out from my AND, too, and I'm sorry to hear your healing isn't going as speedily as you'd like. Is there a particular problem? I got cording just after my second op, which is no fun at all. MelMel--I have up and down days with the emotions. Most of the time, I'm just fine. Then out of the blue, I'll burst into tears.

So many brave ladies on this loop. You are all inspiring. Thanks for being here. Day 2 Tx 1: Still feeling okay, but a little 'off'. I've experienced a bit of nausea despite my Zofran, but I was given Stemetil/Compazine to take if the nausea rises, and I've been very quick to pop one if there's even a hint of stomach upset. So far, all I've had is some queasiness. Enough to wake me up in the middle of the night last night--but that could also be the steroids. I'm drinking like crazy trying to wash everything out.

It doesn't help that exams are just around the corner. Sherry9316--My nurses said ALL fluids count. Soup, ice cream, and fruit included. Anything that gets liquid into your body is good. Caffienated drinks pull the liquid from your body, but they will still help flush the drugs out. Just make sure, as others have said, that you add in all sorts of otherfluids. I drank water and Gatorade, and as one of the other ladies mentioned, strawberry-banana juice. But I also consumed low-sodium soups--they went down really nice.

Hope all is well. brat352--Must be nice to have that 1st tx out of the way. :-) Julia--My recommendation would be: liquids of all sorts, baby wipes, antacid, a fresh toothbrush, a tube of lip balm, Saltines, and daily Activia yogurt. Anyone else got suggestions? SKD--Are you 12 days out from your 1st tx? I was warned that anywhere between 12-14 days the hair would start to fall out. How long it takes is individual and dependent on your cocktail, but I was told that by three weeks most of my hair would be gone. My sister (who has been through this already) told me to wait until the hair starts to fall, then cut it very, very short. I have my wig already, and I'm anticipating the hairs to start falling. I've thought about going commando, but my head is both bumpy and small for my body. I think if I don't wear something, I'll scare myself, LOL.

But she worries, and she hasn't shared any of this with her friends. I fear she's internalizing a bit too much. What can I do but keep the door open for dialog, right? I had my pre-op appointment on Thursday: blood tests, EKG, etc. In  my neck of the woods, a simple MX + SNB w/no recon is a day surgery. They send you home the same day, with a nurse to check up on you day 2 and day 5. My sister, who had the same surgery three years ago said she did just fine. I'm hoping the same is true for me.",

Hopefully the Drs will be able to get you more comfortable. Hantayo--Yay on the negative nodes! Glad to hear you came through surgery so well. Thanks to everyone for the extra exercises! I got a few in a booklet from my breast center (the standard walk finger up wall, lift arm over head until I feel a stretch, lift arm out to side until I feel a stretch, etc) but I never got any that suggested a circular motion and I find that one reaches some muscles the other don't. I'm a little bummed that I'll probably have to start the exercises from scratch after my AND, but at least I'm ready for it!",

I know I'll make it through, but wow. I won't be done everything until close to Christmas. I'm happy to report that my ALND went well. I was soooo not looking forward to another surgery, but my BS was so supportive and easy-going it made things a lot easier. In fact, everyone at the hospital was cheery and friendly.

I'm not a very patient person, and I hate all the waiting. But I'm rolling with the punches. To those of you anticipating surgeries next week, my thoughts are with you.
