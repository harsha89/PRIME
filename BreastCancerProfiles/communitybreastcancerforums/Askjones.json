I have read about a million posts, but still would like an opinion from the community. I am 41 and just had my first mammogram. I was sent for a diagnostic because of dark nipple discharge and pain in my left breast. Immediate US after mammogram. Saw radiologist for about 30 seconds who told me he was pretty sure the multiple masses in both breasts were fibroadenoma. Don't know how big, where they are located or any other (looking back) helpful information. All women for past 4 generations on mom's side have died of breast cancer. My mom is still alive, but has had a double mastectomy. Naturally she is concerned and thinks I should seek a second opinion. Radiologist did not seem to be concerned and told me to come back in 6 months. If they had grown, they would biopsy. Everything I read about fibroadenoma seems to conflict. Do they normally cause discharge (also only in one breast)? Do they normally hurt this much? The doc says I could have had them for years so why are they only now painful and causing all of these problems...aren't they supposed to get smaller with age? My spouse is nearly insisting that I get a biopsy just to be sure. The woman who did my mammogram seemed very concerned about the color of the discharge, but I wondered if the radiologist even looked at my chart or if he just read the US? I want to trust the doctor and not overreact, but six months is a long time to a wait. My mother was also told to wait 6 months for what turned out to be bc. It sounds like an easy decision to just request a biopsy, but biopsies are expensive. I just don't want to be unecessarily worried. Log in to post a reply",
