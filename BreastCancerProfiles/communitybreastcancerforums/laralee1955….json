    "Content": "Aug 4, 2018 04:49PM - edited Aug 4, 2018 04:50PM by laralee1955 I am on TCHP. Completed 3 cycles and also neulasta. My blood counts get lower each time and the diarrhea has never stopped. The doctor could not feel the tumor or the lymph nodes at the last visit. I am thinking that if they cannot feel it this time, I will do one more cycle and have the surgery. I am just too sick with the medicines and now the neulasta (I had neutrophils of only 2 after my first cycle) and had to take anti-biotics. I have completely lost my voice. All food and drink is nasty tasting. I am exhausted and dizzy. The bone pain was terrible for a week. My feet hurt. Hard to stay hydrated (using a straw so that I cannot taste the water or whatever). Who has quit after 4 cycles of TCHP ?",
