And the focus could be something mimicking the 6mm mass...its a lot to try and and understand. A guided US biopsy is what is listed as the next step, I'm so glad to hear that the MRI will help that process, I just want them to get a good sample and be able to get some answers. Do you think the mass is maybe a cyst? They were worried about complex cysts in July 19 and then did more imaging in April 19. The MRI came into play because the nipple was showing changes and some discharge...and my dr wanted to get some answers on that. Is the \"Background enhancement: Moderate to severe.\" referring to the dense tissue? Also...who does the biopsy usually? Sorry for all the questions...and all the help!",

      "Content": "aseal321 wrote: Hi everyone, well I have had lots of lumps and bumps along the way. I started having comprehensive mammos/US's at 28...and other than lots of painful cysts, nothing major. I am 40 now, and last year my right breast decided to act up, swelled, and just looked different. Had my first call back mammo, they found \"something\" in the chest wall. Turned out to be a septated cyst with lots of debris and such. I moved on, same old thing. But then I started having pain in my right breast and some discharge, my dr had me back in last mth, mammo showed some changes again, and I went in for the MRI yesterday. Basically my normal breast issues have started to take a different form it seems, and usually I just go with it, but now I am admittedly worried. Below are my findings, I am waiting on the scheduling call for the biopsy, but from the research I was able to do, the results sound strange. Anyone had these types of results? TIA~Allison MRI BREAST W/ + W/O CONTRAST BILATERAL: HISTORY: pt w/ dense breasts, cyst, nipple discharge and chronic pain. Synapse. FINDINGS: Extramammary structures: The visualized extramammary structures are without gross abnormality. Lymph nodes: There is no axillary or internal mammary lymphadenopathy. Breast Density: Heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. Background enhancement: Moderate to severe. This diminishes the sensitivity of MRI. RIGHT BREAST: -Within the retroareolar right breast just posterior to the nipple, there is a 6 mm enhancing mass with rapid washout kinetics (subtraction page 62). -At 12:00, 3 cm from the nipple, there is a 4 mm enhancing focus with slow persistent enhancement kinetics (axial subtraction page 68). Multiple scattered cysts are seen. LEFT BREAST: There is no suspicious mass or non-mass enhancement distinguishable from the background parenchymal enhancement. Multiple scattered cysts are seen.

I am not diagnosed with breast cancer, just trying to get some insight-I apologize in advance if you're not comfortable with me asking. I had a mammo last Fri and received the results that day, stating that I needed further testing due to: There is a focal asymmetry in the left lower outer posterior breast. There is a focal asymmetry in the right upper outer posterior breast. I have had comprehensive mammos and US annually due to density issues-but nothing of true concern has ever came back...just a lot of cysts and dense tissue. I have had these tests since I was 28, now 39. So I think that is why I am feeling a way about this all, my mind is wandering I guess, which is what brought me here. I spoke with radiology today and they are waiting on my mammos from my previous provider, and then I will have more answers. Said I am \"priority\" and they need me to get the other tests expedited, so took care of that today. Wondering if you had any signs/symptoms before your diagnosis...hope you are doing well and thank you for your time!",

Last Friday I had another mammo, that day I received results of asymmetry is both breasts, so I had to get the films from my last mammo (from outside my current area) and provide them for review. I did that, and received another call today saying that there is more prominent Left inferior breast asymmetry on the MLO view. So off to a compression mammo and US on 7/19. Now I am used to all of this, have had lymph nodes removed from my neck, and suspicious nipple discharge....and lots and lots of cysts that spiral around in both of my very dense breasts. However, with all of that and the continual testing, I have never had a call back from a mammo. I guess I am actually concerned now, and the funny thing is that my \"problem\" breast...is not the one that is in question. Anyone with any similar circumstances...would love to chat and see things have went for you...thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",

The US tech showed me her view and you could see the stuff inside of it, and its not round, like my other cysts. Now I understand why they were being so cautious.
