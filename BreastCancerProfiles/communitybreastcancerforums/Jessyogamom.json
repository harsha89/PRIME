I am having a mastectomy on just my left breast on Jan. 22. I have no idea what feelings I will experience and would love to hear from others. Honestly this news has not been too devastating. I've been through serious depression, sobriety (22 years sober) and two years of infertility. Those things seemed much harder to go through.  I have no idea how I will feel after the surgery? I will be having the immediate reconstruction with expander.  Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
