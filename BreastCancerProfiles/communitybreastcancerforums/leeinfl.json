Have to agree with Whippetmom that surgeon skill is VERY important to ensure a good result.   There are several threads on here about fat grafting.   Check out Still Uncomfortable with Implants, Has Anyone had Micro Fat Grafting?, Microfat Grafting or Brava Doctor Recommendations, or Visible Ripples in Implants for tons more info.
