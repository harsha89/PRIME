I am stage IIB with 3 positive nodes.  Had right breast mastectomy in Feb, started chemo mid March and my last chemo will be this end of July.  My BS said I don't need radiation, but saw RO this week, will need 6.5 weeks of radiation to start in Sept.  I was hoping no radiation so I can live my life again. I am deciding to go with radiation or not ? any thought will be appreciated. ",
