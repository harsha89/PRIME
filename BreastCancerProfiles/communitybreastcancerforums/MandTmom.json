Long story short, I'm a 36 year old who has been having yearly mammograms b/c of a lump found a few years ago on my left breast. Thankfully it was benign, but b/c of family history I go every year. 6 months ago I found another lump near my armpit on the right side. They did a mammogram and ultrasound, lump was just a cyst nothing to worry about.... However the lady who walked me out to the dressing room with the results said that the radiologist saw some more microcalcifications near the spot on my left breast where I had found the lump a few years before and where they biopsied, and said to come back in 6 months to see if they have grown, or whatever she said. Anyway, so I call recently to set up my 6 month appointment and no where in the file does it say this. They were making me feel like I was crazy and making it up...! Why would I make this up??!! They said I was considered a Catergory 2 and didn't need to come back until I am 40...... I was like this is what I was told so I don't get it.... Thankfully my primary didn't think I was crazy, could see my concern, and is sending me to get my left breast looked at. Has this ever happened to anyone else?? It could be human error, but I still feel like I'm doing something wrong? Overreacting???! ugh........ :( Log in to post a reply",
