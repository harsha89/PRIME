Valstim- I am small so they have not wanted me to wear a bra at all so I wear a tank top and a loose shirt over it. Today they gave me a surgical recovery bra that closes in front Victoria's Secret has nothing to fear! Aquafor stains clothes as well so be aware. The tank tops save my tops from stains as well as a bit more coverage. New Girl- I have not had that issue nor did my team talk about it. I wonder if it is a difference in area of concern and direction of Rays. Good luck with getting that under control!

Last week I was given silvadone cream and told to do hydrogen peroxide/ water soaks 2x a day . It has really helped alone with the cortisone cream. My nipple area was almost black but have new pink skin now. It is very tender but better. Talk with your medical team they may give you something to help. The 2 week mark seems both so close and so far away at the same time! Hang in! I have been very emotional today can't believe tomorrow it's done! Won't see my oncologist again until July when I will probably take the script for Tamo. My strategy is to give it 6 months and then decide whether to go another 6. It seems less overwhelming to think in 6 month chunks . My MO does not think I need to worry much about the treated breast but in the other breast feels I have a 30% chance of getting cancer. My mom and one of her sisters had bilateral BC each several years after the first side. Seems like I'm afraid of everything! Baby steps",
