    "Content": "Camryn wrote: I am 50 yrs olds. I had a mammo in Feb. that was clear. June 1 my Dr found a palpable lump. An ultrasound revealed 3 solid nodules at 10, 11 & outer. I also have multiple lymph nodes the largest 2.9 x 1.4 cm. Nodule 1 measure 2.4 x 1.3 cm #2 is 1.4 x 1.2 cm and a smaller one measuring 1 x 0.7. I am scheduled for a mammo, ultra sound and core biopsies on 2 largest nodules as well as FNA on lymph nodes this Wed. üòØ My question is when giving measurements of the nodules which is height and which is width? I have read that taller then wider is not a good sign.ü§ê Log in to post a reply",
