One thing that came highly recommended to me is the look good/feel better program, it's available through the American Cancer Society in most areas and teaches skin care, makeup and wig tips for cancer patients. I'm cosmetically-challenged so I'm definitely going to take advantage of this!   ",

I just can't bring myself to buzz it before it starts to go though, there's that little part of me that says maybe it won't fall out, even though I know the chance of that is zero.  lauriez - sorry about your terrible experience, isn't venting therapeutic? good for you for raising he11!  kittycat - sorry about your continued delays - I know how much they suck (I had a 5 week delay because my 1st onc forgot to send out my oncotypeDx) but as a friend pointed out when I was ready to hit the roof, at least we're lucky to have a relatively slow growing cancer where they can afford to wait for all these tests and scans.  and one more thing, as if we all don't have enough to worry about, make sure you check all your prescriptions carefully, I just caught a mistake by my pharmacy!",

Concerning the anxiety of starting chemo, just try to relax, certainly you would be crazy if you weren't nervous about SE's, but just see what happens.  I hope I'm not shooting myself in the foot here, but I just had the IV premeds, dexamethasone and Emend and side effects were minimal after AC#1.  I had compazine and zofran if needed, but never had to take any. I was more relaxed the weekend after my first chemo than I had been in a long time Ativan has also worked great for me.  I was prescribed some after I nearly had a meltdown in the MRI (face down for 45 mins!) and was told I could take it before bed to help me sleep or the morning of procedures (MUGA, PET, port placement).  It takes the edge off just a little for me.  As one of my nurses put it, you don't get any gold stars for going through this with minimal meds.  Ask for and use whatever meds you need to be comfortable (mentally and physically).    ",
