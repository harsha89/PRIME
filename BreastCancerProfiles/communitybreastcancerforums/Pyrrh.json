The quote that cracked me up was that \"they found that patients do better and are happier if they don't have to wear the devices over the weekend\". I thought .... well duh. I elected to go this route (they didn't argue at all) because I am young at 46 and I am an athlete - trying to keep treatment as localized as possible so that my other organs and especially my arm (lymph nodes...) don't suffer unintended consequences. Other than my age being under 50, they said I fit the profile perfectly and as far as I understand it the only reason they don't automatically offer it to younger patients is that it is a newer treatment so not quite as much longevity on the studies.",

I am much more tired today, but that could totally be due to the fact that my cough kept me up all night. LOL. 5/10! Half done! HUMP DAY! Nothing special happened today, but I am trying to think of something I didn't tell you yet. Oh, after treatment is done (which is behind a HUGE THICK door that is electronically controlled for opening and closing) the physicist comes in with this yellow sensor thing. It sort of looks like a mini-vac. It's their 3rd check for loose/rampant radiation I think. The machine checks, there's a box on the wall with a blinking light that checks, and then they wave the mini-vac around. They also take my blood pressure and heart rate once a day. Rather uneventful. I had them sign my form for a program called \"Cleaning for a Cause\" - they try to hook up a cleaning crew with a cancer patient for a cleaning (maybe more than one? A girl can dream...). I hope they can schedule something. I am totally able to clean my house, but it would be real nice to not have to and to use that energy for my family :) EDIT TO ADD: Okay, finished the 2nd treatment of today. Nothing notable, except for them being horribly behind schedule. Ahh, if that's the worst thing to happen in this whole thing. I took a selfie of the catheter poking out for posterity. The nurse walked in (he's a man) and laughed and asked if I wanted him to take the photo. Turns out my selfie was fine. I asked him if I was the only lady taking boob selfies around here and he said it is pretty common. Anyhow, two more days. 2nd EDIT: I just remembered my new factoid for the day - I guess my treatments are short not only due to the new \"source\", but also because my catheter is a mini. They told me the lady after me has a large sized catheter and her treatment is 4x as long (which is still pretty short, but nothing like my 3:45...)",

Thoughts for the day, which I don't yet have answers for: Do the bigger catheters have more channels? How many different size catheters are there? The nurse and I were chatting, and those were questions we came up with. I'm less tired than yesterday, although perhaps ever so slightly light headed. I slept great last night, which probably is helping the feelings of tiredness. Three more treatments and out it comes! EDIT: OK I found a SAVI training slideset (sheesh, you can research almost anything these days online...). It appears there are 4 sizes of SAVI. A 10-1 (11 channels), an 8-1 (9 channels), and both a 6-1 and a 6-1 mini (7 channels). The biggest one is 7.5 cm long (referencing the bulb part) and 5cm diameter, going down to 5cm long and 2.4 cm diameter for the mini. For those who want to know more than the average person probably ever wanted to know about setup, here's the link to the slideset.",

The nurse put lidocaine gel in the hole using a syringe and a very very tiny rubber \"not a needle\" (it was flexible) then I waited about 10 minutes. The doctor came in, we chatted for about 30 seconds, he collapsed the catheter and just pulled it out lickity split. Didn't even sort of kind of hurt. Just a pulling sensation. Some of that seroma fluid came out (which is normal) and when that stopped they put neosporin on it and a pile of bandages. I get to use the tube top for one more night to hold bandages (it was that or use tape). Said it would probably close up in 3-4 days, and I can shower tomorrow. Massaging it in the shower will allow the goop to run out which is a good thing. They also gave me my SAVI SISTERS pin.  I did ask for it, and they cleaned it off real good then put it in a biohazard bag. The mini is so much smaller than the example ones they showed me! It's way tinier than I thought it would be. Now I just get to wait for the repeat Oncotype test, and hope that it also comes back super extra low (the first one scored a 2, but the MO doesn't believe it... LOL) Good luck with your rads next week Fightingirl - can't wait to hear about how it goes with your system. I am sure it will go great! <hugs>",

After cleaning the area and draping, she numbed with lidocaine, Made a little incision, then put the device in. The fluid from the cavity flowed out (gross, and warm). Then she covered it in gauze and bandages and I drove over to the radiation center. She kept telling me I might be uncomfortable or feel pressure, but I felt nothing at all. At the radiation center they started with a CAT scan. Quick process. They fit my upper body into a cool form fitting pillow first. Then I went in and they took initial placement photos. Then (surprise!) they told me it would take 60-90 minutes to make the treatment plan. So my husband went out and got us Sonic for lunch. Everyone laughed. They actually finished the plan pretty fast, couldn't have been more than 45 minutes. We then went back into a room, and the \"physicist\" hooked up two of the (6?) catheters to the machine. I guess per their \"plan\" they only need to use two.... Treatment was 4 minutes. The tubes that connected me to the radiation machine moved around a bit but I couldn't feel anything during treatment. Afterwards, the nurse gave me a lovely medical tube top to hold the dressings on. They said they found that ladies were having bigger skin reactions from the tape being put on and pulled off 2X a day, than from the actual treatment. Over that went my sports bra, and off we went to pick up antibiotics. I go back at 4 for the 2nd treatment. All of the staff kept telling me they were glad I qualified, in their opinions this is totally the way to go. Supposedly I will feel fantastic through about mid day on Wednesday, then I'll start to want to nap all day. Right now I am very comfortable.",

CT Scan --- I had an air bubble. They had to try to mash it out. Took 3 times, and after the 3rd time they decided to do the full CT scan imaging just in case it didn't work so they could plan around it. However, it worked so I treated as normal. I won't lie, the mashing of my flesh around the catheter did not feel great. It wasn't horrid, but it was pretty intense. However, within minutes I was again pain free. Oh, and there are 7 total catheters. I know because they didn't have one hooked up. I guess my 4 minutes of treatment is almost entirely through one of hte catheters, because they came in to make sure the 2nd one was fully attached and then I had about 5 seconds left after that.

The tumor was in the 6:00 position, so the \"tail\" location that protrudes from me comes out under my arm and tucks neatly in the side of the sports bra I purchased. The slideset I linked has a chart which determines which of the devices you get. It's based on the length and diameter of your cavity. I have been taking Tylenol all week, not that it has been hugely uncomfortable (I only really notice it occasionally) ... but I take it before I sleep (theory there, the more sleep I get the better healing I go through), and before each appointment (just in case I get an air pocket and have to be \"massaged\" LOL). Since it's a 6 hour medicine (my Tylenol) I'm covered most of the day. it does wear off in the evening and then again during the night, but I don't notice a significant change in how things feel. Will look forward to links to other good threads! :)",

The Physicist forgot to take the \"key\" out after, it's a metal rod and significantly heavier than the other catheter tubes; so when we got to the nurse and he pulled it out there I was like \"ahhhh\". The weight pulling down was a little bit touchy. So, remind the person administering the radiation treatments to remove that key before walking to the other room for dressings. Fightingirl, the catheter has 6 (I think, I'll have to ask to remember) tubes sticking out of me, that right now are bundled up and tucked under my super sexy tube top. When they do treatment, they connect the pertinent ones of those up to the tubes that come out of the machine that controls it all. Then a long wire with a radiation seed goes down the tube into the cavity for treatment - I guess they are accurate within a millimeter of where they want the radiation to land. I asked what kinds of factors go into the treatment plan and so far I was told that things like proximity to skin and chest wall are significant. Also, each one of the SAVI catheter tubes has a little \"plug\" that goes in it between treatments - it's a long, flexible wire with a cap on the end. Keeps \"debris\" out. I guess the local anesthesia will start wearing off sometime between tonight and day 3, so I will prep my handy-dandy bottle of Tylenol.",

The shower tomorrow will feel great, but I haven't had too hard of a time of it - washed my hair in the sink (the techncian thought that was a bit much on the movement, but I really didn't move much...) daily, and did thorough sponge baths. Except for the part under the sports bra I am as clean as I usually am. The mesh tube top is getting a bit itchy though. I can imagine it would have been worse with tape coming on and off my skin on that side, so I'll deal with a bit of itching.",

I wanted to toss my experiences here on this thread as well, maybe to help ease peoples stress a little. I found the SAVI treatment process to be a real breeze - so it can happen that way. Obviously not everyone reacts the same way, so I count my blessings that everything went as great as it did. Mine was inserted Monday morning - I drove over, did sim, then did the first treatment that day. Two each day, then on Friday after the last treatment they pulled it out. The one part I really disliked was when it shifted and there were air bubbles and they had to manipulate my breast to try to get things in place again. I actually told my poor RO that I didn't like her any more. LOL. Note - I had a small tumor, and thus a small cavity, and thus got to have the \"mini\" SAVI. This undoubtedly played into the entire experience going so well. I also have a notoriously high pain tolerance - but, I wasn't tolerating pain there just wasn't any. I too was on antibiotics for the entire course of treatment, and was asked not to shower. I washed my hair in a sink - they told me that might be why I got air bubbles twice (that's lots of moving around...) From reading other peoples experiences - I think another factor in my treatment going so well was that the nurses used no tape for the entire week. My nurse told me that the tape really irritates patients skin going on and off so much; so he would just pack the gauze on and then I had a LOVELY mesh tube bra that held it on there. So it was gauze - mesh bra - front closing sports bra - clothing. Probably wierd, but I asked to keep my savi. It's in a bag. On the other thread that you posted in I did a daily blog style entry for what happened each day. Perhaps that will help you? I will send great thoughts your way that everything will go smoothly and routine in your SAVI treatment :)",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2017 12:52PM - edited Jan 17, 2017 01:11PM by Pyrrh Hi ladies - a little update from me. I've been healing from my lumpectomy of last Thursday (5 days ago) very nicely - had virtually no seepage or bleeding of any kind. Even taught two TKD classes last night (mostly verbally, but hey...). Pretty much full range of motion with my affected side arm. Even the SNB incision isn't too big of a deal. Biggest deal is minor/partial numbness down the underside of my arm - I can still feel things but not 100%. Surgeon says that will resolve itself. I have found everything to be more comfortable inside my bra- regular bra, not the sports bra. Same size as always. Funny story, when I was in the \"nuclear medicine\" room (great name!), the gentleman attending to me asked if I had my wires yet and I said \"nope, no wires\" ... he did a double take. Then looked on the computer. When we rolled out of the room after the totally painless injections he said \"you are seeing Doctor XYZ. Very good. Very experienced\". However, in my brain I was going \"omg omg they forgot the wires!!!\". So when Doctor XYZ visited just before surgery to say hi I asked her if that was an oversight and she told me \"nah, I don't need the wires. Easy enough to see yours with the ultrasound.\" I told her I was pleased because it seemed a little late to get that done. Thankfully, she was right! So, no wire whiskers for my breast. The verbal results from the pathology (they haven't actually released the formal, written report yet) was that the margins are clear and the lymph nodes (3 were taken) were clear. The tumor ended up being 1.2 cm (radiology reports varied from 1.2 to 1.4). All that said, they asked if I wanted to start the SAVI brachytherapy radiation treatments Monday! I postponed a week so we can set up coverage at work and due to house guests that leave Monday morning. They will implant the catheter device early Monday, I will drive to the radiation treatment facility and start treatments immediately. Two per day, then after Friday's treatment return to the Surgeon to have the device pulled out. No weekends with attachments. I haven't yet talked to my MO regarding chemo; and I already know tamoxifen is in my immediate and long term future due to the highly ER/PR positive tumor. As an addon to the lumpectomy vs masectomy decision - for my case, which is still assumed to be Stage 1A, I was told that there is no difference between the two treatments - except for lumpectomy comes with required radiation and masectomy \"might\" not need radiation afterwards. Recurrence and survivability were stated to be the same. I do notice that at least one of the studies linked above talked about stage II and III disease. I do like BarredOwl's further review of the paper and advice to take that information to your doctors. Mine have been very willing to discuss whatever I brought to them, and I hope and expect everyones doctors to be the same. I do have to admit, that reading all of these pamphlets they keep giving me that are supposed to be encouraging is starting to freak me out. They keep quoting chances at 10 year survival. I definitely plan on being around way longer than 10 years, I am only 46. I might just stop reading the pamphlets! Like I need more things breaking down my courage. Sheesh. edit to add - DCISinAZ - that picture was HILARIOUS! Thanks for sharing :)",

Not a lot of nerves around there. I was teaching TKD classes 3.5 days after my surgery. Obviously, your mileage varied considerably. :( I can well imagine that a long incision high up on the breast would be MUCH more uncomfortable than mine. Lots more pulling and shifting for starters. I do concur about picking up the child, although anything that can be done with the OTHER side of your body would likely be very possible.",

Good to hear from you all :) If everyone can keep updating their profile for latest treatments (surgery, diagnoses, meds, etc) it will help us all keep up with who had a masectomy vs lumpectomy, etc. Also you have to make it public. That keeps the signature part under our posts updated with the latest. I taught my full, 4-hours of TKD classes last night. The adults heard me tell the kids I can't do weapons with them, and they were like \"are you broken?\" ...I'm so not telling an entire martial arts school. So I said \"yeah, a little. Working on it\". I think that is what stresses me out the most, reading all of the stories from people about lymphedema and what you can and can't do - I fully plan on using my arm heavily (sparring is my favorite part of martial arts) and the idea that even the \"trauma\" of blood pressure would be potential to kick me over into that condition is totally unacceptable. I know it's not fully in my control, but I hope that what my arm thinks is \"traumatic\" is a higher level than most due to my years of training. Sigh. Talked to my surgeon yesterday and told her that I had taught a few classes the previous night, she laughed and said \"how'd that go for you?\". I got a grin out of it because I TOTALLY asked her permission. Twice. I told her it was fine, and so far it was. Interestingly, she seemed pretty certain I would get a seroma and told me how to manage it and what to do if it got too uncomfortable. But she also stressed that having one makes the process of setting up the device for the brachytherapy easy. So she asked me not to work it too much with heat, so it wouldn't go all the way away when it appeared. LOL. \"Take care of it, but not too much please!\" I really like this surgeon. Practical and matter of fact. Oh, and someone was wondering about drains - no drains here. But I was a small tumor lumpectomy, surgeon said it's a very small cavity. Do they often do drains for lumpectomies?",

I think the one referred to as \"balloon\" is a different manufacturer/model. Mammosite maybe?   You are on the young side, very similar to me. They initially suggested standard length, full breast rads due to my age. I asked about brachytherapy specifically to keep the radiation as localized as possible, in the hopes that I can remain active in martial arts and have less potential for affecting my lungs and heart. They didn't bat an eye, got out the examples to show me, and signed me right up. I think their current \"age\" is either 50 or 45, and the only reasoning behind staying conservative with younger patients is a lack of data about REALLY long term effectiveness. Make sure to ask all of the questions though, I'd be interested in what your RO has to say about it.",

At least two weeks. She's going to talk to my surgeon and my RO to see if they can do brachytherapy later (I doubt it), or what their recommendations are for if I can do radiation first then chemo later if necessary. I told her I was frustrated at the surgical pathology report, because about 75% of it was a simple regurgitation from my biopsy pathology report. I had thought they would report on their own findings not spit out what someone else did on an entirely different piece. 4- I asked about my future in martial arts -- since my arm will both have to strike things and get hit, and the MO said \"oh, I wouldn't do that\". Dude, that's my career, my workout routine, and a good portion of my social life right there. My arm HAS to work.

When I told her I wasn't planning contact, but lots of full range motion, she was not worried. That said, I talked to her after teaching two days and told her what I had been doing and she laughed and said \"how's that going for you?\" (answer - fine). I am the happiest when teaching, there's no time to think about this other crap. Although with the residual soreness I do get reminded when moving around. I am anxious to start training for myself again and not just teach classes. Hey Bugchaser - I recently moved from northern Colorado, in fact that's where I had my mammogram and biopsy (since I was back \"home\" for a long Christmas holiday). Living in Texas now. Wish I could have stayed at the facility in Colorado, they seemed much better and more on top of things. Here I have to pull and press and insist for every step of the way.",

It's super frustrating because I had to line up a whole weeks worth of subs at the school (and there's not a large pool of qualified folks to take over a martial arts class) and now it might be postponed. Plus, obviously I knew the ramifications of an Oncotype 2 and was understandably excited about a week of radiation then on with life. Ambiguity sucks. The deal with my arm is potential for lymphedema - the arm will work just fine. Or maybe not. Invisible ghouls waiting to perhaps (or perhaps not) cause problems. <sigh>",

We've come up with a cool little group here :) Two things of vital importance .... (edited to add - I'm not so serious of a person that I truly think these items are vital, so I am hoping you read it as the joke it is intended as here! We are so glad to have the opportunity to get to know you and to support you, as well as to learn from your knowledge!) 1) Do you have a pet? We all shared photos of our kitties and puppies about a week ago. If you didn't see it you should scroll back, there are some seriously cute furbabies in this group! 2) it will help us all to support you if you put as much of your diagnosis and treatments as you are comfortable sharing into the system and make them public so they show up in the signature line. That way we don't have to remember all of the details of each other when we have conversations :) Sorry to hear that you have to deal with an infection and related issues, that has to be rough. I don't know what they will have to do for that either but I am relieved that you are treating it already and have a followup on Wednesday.",

In my personal opinion, we should be careful about all of the articles that will state various things that will increase our chance at recurrence. Of course, your mileage may vary on this, but I am super leery about sensationalist articles that say how we can increase or decrease our risk. I will stick to hard, medical facts myself. Of course, lifestyle changes that lend themselves towards proven factors (like losing weight) I am happy to give a shot; but at my age I do intend to enjoy drinks every once in a while, ice cream, cheese fondue, and all of those other things. Not daily of course, but yeah. When I took research statistics in grad school, they were very clear that you can't take a sample - find commonalities, and then draw conclusions. You can use that as basis for starting an actual study, but it is important to determine a cause and effect rather than just factors that exist in common. I didn't explain that the best, but I hope the gist came across. On a personal note, I just called Genomic Health back (they are the company that processes the Oncotype tests) and they told me that the 2nd Oncotype was cancelled because it was on the same source (same tumor). They apparently don't rerun a test even if the first sample was biopsy and the 2nd was lumpectomy, their research states that their results are valid across the entire source. I bet my doctor was fit to be tied. LOL. She better give in to my Oncotype score of a TWO, unless there's another factor (they also did genetic testing, and that could bump me into chemo land as well I think....).

My MO called (she obviously did not know I had an appointment later today) and caught me up on everything. She says she actually pushed back hard on the Oncotype DX folks, went way up the chain, and some panel in California reviewed the situation and decided to re-run the test even though they had decided not to earlier. She also called the local pathologist and talked to him about how they copied info from my biopsy pathology report straight into their report, and asked him to review our areas of concern. He confirmed the perineural invasion (said \"a tiny little bit, but it is there\"), and sent the KI-67 back out for a re-test. However, she also talked to some other MO friends of hers who specialize in breast cancer, and they looked at everything and all agreed that they were super comfortable with the Oncotype test result and wouldn't treat with chemo. Long and short, she \"thinks it looks like I probably won't\" need chemo, but we are rescheduling for 2 weeks from now so the new Oncotype and KI-67 results can come in (and so I can also heal up from radiation). Then, \"probably\" we'll start up the Tamoxifen and call it a day. Not sure I get to celebrate, but at least she did her homework this time. I also should get the 2nd opinion report from the Best Doctors service sometime today, I sure hope they concur.",

(Strangely, I didn't have to be lectured about radiation; but the Tamoxifen that they keep saying most people do fine on requires a special appointment just to review side effects.) They have re-run my KI-67, which originally was high at 23. The re-run was a 13. Quite obviously that is not a reliable marker. The MO says that I would have to get a fairly shockingly high score on the repeat Oncotype (original was a lovely 2) in order for her to even think about chemo at this point. That Oncotype is theoretically going to be done on Monday. Is anyone else finding the process of following the insurance claims to be completely overcomplicated? There seriously has to be a better way. I swear half of the money we pay for medical treatment goes to the battalions of financial/insurance people that it takes to even sort of keep on top of all of that paperwork.

It looked like something fun to do. There is also a care box service where you can list the types of things that would be helpful to you in recovery - I put that on hold until I know about chemo, as I haven't really needed much of anything special yet. CAREBOX - http://careboxprogram.org/ There are a lot of \"freebie\" services, but those were the two that stood out to me.

And yes, super heavy periods now. That Tamoxifen! I've always had really bad cramps during \"shark week\", and it seems I went into this with a thickened lining. Which is now thicker (just had a 3 month checkup with the gyno to look into it.) At the checkup we were discussing options like IUD to control the thickening, and then many options up to and including a hysterectomy. I'm fully pre-menopausal, so the hysterectomy idea doesn't really appeal to me. I might not get much of a choice, depending on what they saw with the sonogram images on Friday (stuck ovary? cysts?). I'm definitely going to throw it out there that I am fully willing to NOT take Tamoxifen (my risk of recurrance is so low already...) TW, I am really starting to dislike going to the standalone radiology centers - where they do scans but don't talk to you. I much prefer it when the physician is involved and can say \"see this? It's your uterine wall and it's a bit thick. Measuring now...\" I guess I found my side-effect to the \"Bottle-o-Tamoxifen\" (a thread I still refuse to read!)",

I finally heard back from my pelvic ultrasound that I did on Friday (had to really hound the doctors office to call me back though.) They say redo the ultrasound in 8 weeks. He's just watching the thickness of that lining really closely I think. They did find two cysts on one of my ovaries - a 2.5 cm \"benign simple cyst\", and a 1.1 \"hemorrhagic cyst\". I don't think either of those are really worrisome? I mean, I've always had serious cramps and now is no different, otherwise no pain. I wonder how long those cysts have been there. Also finally got numbers on my endometrial lining - 4mm (which, I think is the max thickness before they take action.) My favorite line (not) was \"otherwise, normal pelvic ultrasound for the patients age\". What on earth does my age got to do with it? Makes my overactive brain wonder what types of issues they saw that they disregarded due to age. I want them to treat me like a 20 year old :) Well, next week is that first mammogram. Looking forward to it and dreading it simultaneously. At least I put my foot down and insisted on going to a breast center (where they give results immediately) rather than the radiology center that did my ultrasounds. Those techs aren't allowed to tell us anything, and the questions they asked me made me so nervous about what they were seeing \"what did they say you were in for, exactly?\" followed by a frown, and more measuring of stuff. Argh. They need to know that for most of us, the unknown is worse than ANYTHING.",

Learned so much from the casual BC chatter there! I thought that my lumpectomy would be scheduled sometime next week, but they called me late yesterday and said that wouldn't work, could I come in this Thursday (aka, tomorrow...) I said yes, so now I get one day to prepare. Background: I'm 46. Found the lump December 15th, two days before I was driving out of state for a two week holiday with my family. The local mammogram folks couldn't fit me in on my schedule, so I went ahead and did the diagnostic mammo and ultrasound at my destination. Unfortunately, we all know how this story goes since I am here ... they wanted a biopsy and could do it the next day. I called back home and they couldn't see me until January 17th (easy answer there). So, biopsy out of state - got the call on our drive back home. Small tumor, DCIS with some IDC - no evidence of lymph node involvement. HER2-, ER+, PR+. Nice to meet you all, although I do wish none of us had cause to meet in this manner. Let's kick this cancer junk in the butt! Haven't met my RO yet, I am hoping that the 5 day SAVI protocol remains possible for me (my surgeon showed me the SAVI device, WAY bigger than I imagined but I think I can handle it...). I know Tamoxifen is on the future agenda per discussion with my MO and the really high results for my ER and PR (98% on both, sheesh). Hoping I can somehow find the smooth path through this jungle, I am a martial arts instructor and competitor and need to be able to stay active!

My only advice is that no matter how mad you are try not to burn bridges - set up a meeting, be the ever polite rational but SUPER SQUEEKY wheel and help him to see it from your viewpoint. Channel your inner Shellybeans and don't let him get away with changing his story mid-stream. Shellybeans, I am glad you managed to get them to see reason and approve the testing that your doctor wants you to do. It makes me very happy to know that you are a persistent, strong woman who can advocate for herself in that way! Cowboy-up, I don't know all of the specifications, but the internal brachytherapy has pretty strict ones - the tumor has to be under a certain size (2cm I think?), no node involvement, has to be within a certain time after surgery (for SAVI and I would assume balloon...) and they typically do it with older patients. I had to ask for it at 46 but they didn't even skip a beat when I mentioned my interest. The reason they didn't offer it up front (although their professional opinion was that it was a FANTASTIC option for me) was that they don't have a lot of data on longevity past 10 years or so. They don't expect it to be any different, but they can't prove it. I was fine with that, and so we went with it. I could have done the shorter (Canadian protocol) standard whole breast radiation if I wanted too, but their initial offering was standard length, whole breast. Again, only due to my (lack of) age. I say, if you are interested, just ask.",

Initially, however, he didn't say that the Tamoxifen \"might\" stop my periods, he said that it \"would\" stop my periods. Something I would have welcomed! Let's just say that the next time I talk to my gyn, and my MO, we will have long hard talks about risks with and without Tamoxifen and I'll just go from there. Plus work on getting back to actual fighting form! (I'm not in great shape, darn hamstring pull! LOL!) Vargadoll - Ugh, yes, I'm so tired of a different doc for every body part (or for every TREATMENT on a body part). I had a UTI, and my PCP said it tested negative (came out positive on the culture however) ... before we got the culture results she told me \"give it another week and if it doesn't improve I'll send you to the urologist.\" I was thinking, really, just give me the antibiotics. Turned out I was right. ",

I am impressed and super glad you are pleased :) My news - mammogram all clear. They made me wait forever (like, an hour!) after the scans because the radiologist was busy. Then, he wanted my records from surgery and radiology to make sure everything lined up.... then they put me out of my misery and told me it all looked great and they'd see me in 6 months. Regardless of the wait, I am glad to have found a place that will read and give you results on the spot. They offered to let me leave earlier and get a phone call but I wanted to know ASAP (of course).",

Intellectually I know it's not my fault, but I feel like such a let down for being the one in the family to get cancer. Yesterday was my mom's 70th birthday, so we have to figure out somewhere fun for dinner. Plus an outing of some sort, since my newly adopted 9 month old Terrier Mix is turning into some sort of a beast who only wants to play and will nip/bite you incessantly if you don't.

But, now other people will find out and I'm really really bad at being the center of attention. I guess i'll just have to figure it out. I'm glad they know. Welcome to our new friends - wish you didn't need to be here, but this is the best thread (we share dog photos!) for support :) Speaking of dogs - started clicker training with little Claire. I'm already sick of it! She, however, is doing very well. I hope she turns into a good girl, rather than an adorable tazmanian devil! We shall see. Glad to hear about all of the little victories and healing going on. Makes me happy! As for me - 1 week until brachytherapy. SLN incision is feeling better - still just a touch of numbness but I am certain it is getting better. The seroma under my arm might be getting smaller - it's definitely bugging me less. Unfortunately I don't think I got a seroma in my tumor removal area (that's the place we wanted one, to make the insertion of the catheter thing easier.) Hopefully there's a small one that helps her take care of business next week. Trying to keep the heating pad on my pit but not my breast! LOL. ",

I called the doctor to get a copy of the pathology report from the lumpectomy, and the nurse emailed it to me. (it hadn't been uploaded to my patient portal yet, and she wasn't able to do that part, but she was happy to print, scan, and email. Works for me ...) The first two pages of the document was the results of the Oncotype test (wasn't expecting that for a while...) and ... I got a TWO! According to \"Dr. Google\" that should hopefully mean no chemo for me. Other than the pending genetic testing, I feel like there's not much to rain on my parade. I will go over all of the results with my MO tomorrow and validate with her that the brachytherapy decision is the right one before I start that next week. Fightingirl, I'll let you know if I learn anything else from her tomorrow regarding the SAVI :) Dafne - ahhh Greece! Would love to visit someday. DSMom's photos are gorgeous!",

I will venture out to read and post, but you all are my \"girls\". :) Ahhhh, a cruise sounds great. Especially right now. My MO is now out of town and never called me back regarding radiation next week!!!???? I did, however, find that my insurance has a program called \"Great Doctors\" where I can put in all my info and they have a panel of doctors (supposedly in the top 5-10% of their field) who will do an expert review and give me a 2nd opinion. I filled it out yesterday, wish I had done so a few weeks back so I could have told the MO and have a plan at this point. Everything I've read corroborates what I thought - my \"high\" (at 23%, just over the border of 20) KI-67 probably got nullified by the super high ER+ and PR+ numbers (over 98% each) meaning the hormonal therapy will be so effective the chemo doesn't add anything meaningful to the risk. Plus, if we re-run the Oncotype on my surgical specimen, the KI-67 will likely return higher since my body was repairing the core biopsy as well as growing cancer. If anyone here in this thread has read (or been told by their doctors) anything different than this let me know your learnings, I am hardly an expert. Although I hate to say I felt more informed than my MO yesterday, which made me seriously question sticking with her. DSMom- a few years back I trained TKD with a man who was in the Canadian National Guard (I think that's it) - he had to go home every summer to fulfill his duties, then he would return to us for the fall/winter/spring. I think that's awesome that you serve your country like that! Glad to see that even with a mastectomy your doctor has cleared you for activity. Every time I do stuff with my TKD class I'm thinking \"this is probably so not allowed\" but I do it anyway. My arm works great, only a bit sore underneath from the armpit seroma and a bit of tingly nerve damage up the underside of the arm.",

Plus, I am healing up super super well and my breast has a nice shape despite missing a chunk of flesh. Maybe it's because the cup is holding everything in place in a normal shape? I don't know. I wore the front closing, Fruit of the Loom sports bras (two sizes too big) that I was advised to puchase for brachytherapy and found them to be less comfortable, but doable. My MO even asked me if I got a crazy post-surgical bra and I said \"no, just my normal one\" then showed her my breast and she was astonished at how healed it looked. I tried going bra-less yesterday for an hour or so, but ultimately ended putting the bra back on. I think I'm just nervous about it. Still sleeping in it too. I used to pretty much ditch the bra at the door, found them super uncomfortable. LOL.",
