Would like to have a reduction on the other side so that I don't feel so lopsided until I do reconstruction, which will be at least a year down the road since I have to have radiation too. In any case I would plan to reconstruct down several sizes for a minimal silhouette. It seems pretty logical to me to do the reduction at the same time as the masectomy but my surgeon doesn't seem keen on the idea. Has anyone else done this?

The PS said I could do the mastectomy, immediate reconstruction with lat flap plus implant (since I donÂ´t have enough tissue), and reduction on the other side all at the same time. I was surprised that immediate reconstruction was an option since I'm having radiation and fully expected my conservative BS to nix the idea, but she didn't, so it looks like that's what I'll be doing, and I'm very happy to get it all over with in just one surgery. The other good news is that they may move the surgery to the week before, depending on availability of operating theaters, so I would be out in time for the holidays. sonclem, thanks for the warning. I guess wiping me will be one more thing my dear partner will have to put up with. Does anyone happen to have a link to some sort of chart/diagram/photos of different breast sizes, not necessarily cancer related? Google has not been too helpful - mostly jokey/pornographic rather than medical. I would like to be able to show the PS where I would like to be in terms of size because I think it's smaller than what she thinks. Surprisingly she didn't have any samples to show me. (I'm in the public health system in Europe - great care but very bare bones!) thanks! Izzy",
