It is COMPLETELY red and bruised now. I am just icing it and trying not to do to much. I guess the double mastectomy next week will take care of it for me....",

I can;t decided if I look good for having cancer or if I am just really rocking the steroid swollen face, bald head look that day. As for forcing myself to \"be strong\" and put on a happy face everyday. I am still trying to do that but fail miserably some days. It is exhausting to go to work- not because my work is hard but just because it is tiring to smile and answer the questions. Hugs are another thing - I really should not be getting all these hugs b/c my whilte cells drop to zero after each treatment. I totally do not have time to get sick either. SO I am constantly trying to deflect the hugs and say that I am highly susceptible to germs. Some people INSIST on the hug and say - Oh I am not sick! Well maybe you are not sick but you have a normal immune system- who knows what you are carrying! Thanks for posting - I was ready for a good rant! ",

I think during the post-treatment phase, we all spend so much time trying to balance that fine line between psycho-paranoid-hypochodriac and smart, balance concerned survivior simply looking out for ourselves. I have been having pain in my right (cancer side) shoulder for several months. I had the bone scan and it was fine. The pain is still there - in my rational mind I just know that it is either muscular or is left over rads damage. Of course my nutty, late-night paranoid self just KNOWS it is some sort of recurrance that cannot be sen on a bone scan... sigh - such is our life.",

I am going in for a biopsy next Thursday and am in the same boat as far as pretty much keeping this scare to myself. I have told my husband and my bestfriend but that is it. The waiting is so hard. I go from one moment just \"knowing\" that it is back to the next minute just \"knowing\" that this is a silly scare. ugh!  ",

It is now a year and ahalf later and I am \"officially\" post-menopausal. I am switching from tamoxifen to arimidex this month. I will get Lupron shots for a while to make sure that my ovaries are good and shut down. I tolerated tamoxifen well (with the aid of 75mg of Effexor) and I am hopeful that Lupron and Arimidex will not be too much of a change.  ",
