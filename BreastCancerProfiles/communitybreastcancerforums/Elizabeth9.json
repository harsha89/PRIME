Having cancer put me into a whole new world that I didn't even know existed. I am stunned by how many people have this, how full the wait rooms are, how busy the chemo pods are, how nice the nurses are, and how kind people in general are, despite their misguided comments about being brave, or rocking the biker chick look. I just want it all to be over, so I can begin healing. And I am only done #2 of 8! Such a baby I am!

In other (upsetting but) exciting news, this is also being launched in Canada in October, and I am determined to spread the word. Dense breasts are the reason I am in this group, with an 'invisible' primary tumour that likely has been stealthily setting up shop in my body for over 6 years...despite annual clear mammos. I had my first chemo last week. Have a look, and please spread the word about dense breasts to your family and friends. #TellMe \u2013 HEALTH AUTHORITIES AREN'T TELLING WOMEN THEY HAVE DENSE BREASTS PUTTING THEM AT GREATER RISK FOR BREAST CANCER AND A DELAYED DIAGNOSIS 24 September 2018 \u2013 Toronto \u2013 A national online campaign to help reduce the number of Canadian women being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer is officially being launched this October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. #TellMe is being driven by Dense Breasts Canada (DBC), an organization dedicated to raising awareness, education and advocacy around women being informed of their breast density, the associated breast cancer risks, and having more options to support early-stage cancer detection. Health authorities across Canada collect a patient's density as assessed by a radiologist reading the mammogram but, in most cases, do not share that information with the GP or the patient. And mammograms miss up to 50% of breast cancers in the densest breasts. The #TellMe campaign is asking health authorities to add one line to the letters they already send to women after their mammogram, notifying women of their density category and its associated risks with breast cancer. Ontario only recognizes women in the highest density category \u2013 those with over 75% breast density. That ignores a million women in the 50-75% category who are at significant risk for breast cancer. Dense Breast Canada's Medical Advisor, Dr. Paula Gordon, a clinical professor of Radiology at UBC and Medical Director of the Breast Program at BC Women's Hospital, said it is \"patronizing\" not to notify women of this risk factor as doctors regularly disclose other risk factors to their patients such as blood pressure and cholesterol. \"Having dense breasts is a greater risk factor than having a family history of breast cancer. By the time cancer is detected, it is often larger, more aggressive and at a later stage in women with dense breasts. Women with dense breasts should consider supplemental screening, such as an ultrasound. Early detection saves lives,\" Gordon said. Women who know they have dense breasts can also be more vigilant about self-exam and mitigate lifestyle risk factors. The #TellMe campaign strives to build a community and voice for women, where they can engage and support one another online in a bid to raise awareness, share stories, answer questions and concerns, and encourage each other to take action to ensure they become aware of their own breast density. \"While we completely support the concept of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,\" said Jennie Dale, Co-Founder of Dense Breasts Canada, \"a crucial piece of the puzzle is missing. For years, breast density has been known, but intentionally overlooked by health authorities. We frequently hear from women with breast cancer, saying they wish they had known about the risks of dense breasts. When women are kept in the dark about their breast density, they are denied a chance to be proactive to reduce their cancer risk. We're seeking to do something about this through our #TellMe campaign by building and empowering a community of women committed to change.\" Last week, British Columbia announced they would begin notifying women of their breast density in their post-mammogram results letters, making BC the first province in Canada to take this important step. DBC would like Ontario to step up and be number two. Case study/interview opportunity Ontario resident and breast cancer survivor, Ann Hill, was first made aware that she had dense breasts after discovering a lump in her breast at age 36. \"The doctor told me that the lump was not cancer, but that I did have dense breasts.\" Eventually, the lump went away on its own, but no further testing was done nor was Ann told any of the implications or risk factors associated with having dense breasts. Eighteen years later, she discovered a new lump in the same breast. \"I had just had a clear mammogram six months earlier, so I thought it was another transient lump.\" But an ultrasound revealed a cancerous tumour and cancer in at least one lymph node. \"I was stunned and thought, 'how could this be?' I went from an all-clear mammogram to Stage 3 cancer in six months.\" Her surgeon told Ann that the cancer had likely been there for quite a while. He explained that dense breast tissue and cancerous tumours both show as white on a mammogram, creating a camouflage effect. The mammogram done six months earlier gave not only a false negative but also a false sense of security for Ann. \"After my first surgery (a lumpectomy), I had three months of dense-dose chemotherapy. Within two weeks of starting chemotherapy, another malignant lymph node was discovered. A second surgery was arranged, this time to remove both breasts and seventeen more lymph nodes. After that, I went through twenty-five rounds of daily radiation.\" During her harrowing cancer journey, Ann met Jennie Dale, co-founder of Dense Breasts Canada, and began to advocate for breast density awareness and notification.

I was so taken off guard it was one of the rare times I couldn\u2019t control public crying. Mine was because a heart ultrasound taken the week before showed changes from the baseline one, and I was experiencing shortness of breath. I was so shocked though with the sudden finish. I felt concerned I didn\u2019t get enough chemo, I had no closure with the chemo ward nurses...it was just a weird feeling. I\u2019m still worried and wish I was able to complete it",

The morning after I felt great, no pain but that changed about 12 hours later. I am taking my pain meds every 4 hours to stay ahead of it. I was terrified of the nuclear Medicine injections but that was a piece of cake. Mine was day surgery. I am glad to be home but need to force myself to go into my bedroom away from the hustle of the house. I find the drains, the pain and the noise of my busy house overwhelming. When alone I feeL calmer. Overall I am feeling much better than anticipated and moving more than I thought I would. No appetite. Have to force myself to eat toast. Now I need to wait for pathology results. Asked my GP to send to me as she gets them in as I know they will come in bits before my actual follow up on Aug 28.",

The pre op nuclear injection part...apparently it is the worst thing ever...and the wait for the pathology report at my follow up on Aug 28. Way too long to wait! I am going to ask my GP to call me right away, as I hear she will have the results in 5 days. Does anyone have words of wisdom for the pre op nuclear injection part? Can I be under a general anesthetic for that?? Do we have to specifically ask (in my case beg and plead?). Also I am scheduled to be at a cottage for two weeks, 12 days post op. Is that crazy? I am thinking it would be nice to lounge around and recover, away from day to day stuff.",
