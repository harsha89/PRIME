Only when they have enough patients that speak up and say what you have just said will it change. I used to work surgery. When I asked, why the men got preop pain meds and women didn't ---the responses varied, but the confused look on the doc's faces didn't. Their preception was men had pain and women didn't. Oddly enough docs verified my preception by saying that men had more pain. Cluckem",

There is a clinical study going on with a sister drug and DUH another drug. I haven't kept up to posting. I was frustrated by low viewings. What is happening I think, is that the medical community is keeping abreast of the Torardol connection, blocks, and no opioids. without the absolute scientific proof. These are three items, that can be done in surgery without big modifications of practice. Simple to accomplash The problem is that action is getting ahead of the science. When the docs see something so promising for treatment. AND they can fit it into their treatment modality. It's to them \"OKAY\". Fore Example. Rainnyc went to methinks Sloan Kettering, they were already using the modality. YOOOHOOO Where that becomes a problem is when we see a drop in statistics without knowing who is using the modality, there can be a false narrative to survival statistics. Obviously, we don't care. We care about prevention and survival. ",

Multiple cases where metal testing did in fact show Titanium as the causative factor. Once a drug or device has been shown to cause an Adverse Event, please insist that the following be done. IMPORTANT: next step in the process is that the FDA reporting paperwork for \"Adverse Event\" Should be sent in by the provider. It's a requirement, but how compliant docs are who knows. Reporting of adverse events with drugs and medical devices is under the oversight by the FDA. Once a threshold level of reports are received by the FDA, they send out a warning and or add a warning to the paperwork related to the device or drug. ",

The numbers of cancers on paternal side are staggering. 12 of 21 women: 3 aunts/7first cousins/1 twin/me; 9 BC, 1 uterine, 1 rare ca of lung found on thumb but not in lung, 1 liver; 5 of 12 have died; BC 3 premenopausal and 6post menopausal. Only three tested for Braca-neg. Most were pre-braca test available. If you caught that i was part of the stats, good catch. After the diagnostic Mammo, I received a NED report, and still have the letter. Next step was a diagnostic MRI. There was a delay from Aug till Dec between the two. There was no imperative b/c of clean mammo. BINGO MRI picked up an IDC. BX Jan 23rd 2009 Grade 2(6), BMX Feb18th Grade 3(8). No sampling error at relook of BX slides. Not even a month and i went from a 6-8. Very aggressive. So, I became a statistic in the family cancer tree. Presumptive, but I maintain I wouldn't be here if I hadn't been on the PMX track. As I wrote in my post from this morning I support Jolie. I'll add, I think she has done more this week for BC than will ever be able to measured. Only so much can be written in one article. To pick her words apart is disingenous. It's her story as others have pointed out. Not my story. Not your story. Her story will be told and retold everytime the media writes something about her from here on out. Each time it will change lives.",

      "Content": "Jul 10, 2013 09:56PM - edited Jul 10, 2013 10:02PM by sas-schatzi Edot , I'm with Kam I have know idea what PTEN is? I was recommended to get a genetic test based on types of cancers in the paternal side ---forget what it was, OH well... AND my  geneticist got it approved--full coverage. All I had to do was get a blood test. DH was dying at the time with Lymphoma, it went on back burner. Then when I resurrected the letter approving the blood test --it was out of required dates. Then called to see if it still could be done. The geneticist grant had run out and they weren't receiving further calls. Kam-I can't remember if I put family stats here or on the other Jolie thread. But as noted the females are at risk for trouble. 12/21 for cancer in some form for the women. 3/21 were the aunts.  The ten paternal aunts and uncles 3 f and 7m.  Of the 7 males, 1 died young- motor vehicle accident, 1 died at 75(dad no cancer) & 1 died at 80 cardiovasc(no cancer), N&T&D&J all had cancer from skin, colon, kidney/prostate, throat. So, of my dad's family of ten kids, 7 had cancer. Have a full second cousin who researched back to IRELAND for the greatgreatgreatfather--no cancer, just cardiovascular. Grandmother raised in Ontario farm community in the early 1900's. Pesticides were unregulated and kids were exposed. I'm taking a great leap in that statement. But no one on that side of the family has done a cancer tree. Based on word of mouth, lots of cousins on the GM's side have died of cancer and their spouses. Numbers unknown. Based on what I have told you, I empirically concluded the genetic break is on the paternal-grandmothers side. Can you believe I have not been able to get someone to study the family. Conversely, when i talk to family, the greatest concern is whether they would be uninsurable or a job risk. DUH \"What about your life and your kids\". Then there's the geneticist. She took all the information. We set up a time to talk. Had a female cousin on skype, and one on a conference call. All 3 of us are nurses. Geneticists-masters nurse. Defines risk for the the two based on a system defining this stuff. BUT she looked at it from an individual risk within a family unit, not in the total paternal group. The person designing the chart to determine risk, I am sure would have said WTF.  But too much was happening in my life to do windmill conquering. The point here is, if you have a genetic analysis, have the final analysis done by a doc geneticist. Do allot of research beforehand, do a family health tree. Another scary thing about doing my Dad's family cancer tree. I circled all that had pre dementia signs at time of death or since developed dementia.  10 siblings---1  male -Motor vehile accident-no data, of the remainining 6 m's--- 5 of 6 had pre dementia signs or full dementia at death. Of 3 aunts-- 1 had predementia, 1 had dementia, both of these are deceased. I aunt who had BC and a recurrence with individual mx's , is now in dementia.  So, of ten siblings-- 8 of 10 had dementia pre or actual.  So, hope I got my Mom's genes, . Wish I got her cancer genes. What I do know is we carry the Hemochromatosis gene. This gene can lead to dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, cirrohsis, arthritis. 1 in 12 americans carry this gene. Usually is not expressed, meaning by disease happening. Usually youhave to inherit from both parents. BUT since the family has such undeniably terrible stats SOMEBODY in the scientific community should blink an eye and say \"Hmmmm there is a cluster we should study them\"...............................",

I wrote this this morning on STFU thread and am reposting it here. 2 hours ago, edited 2 hours ago    by sas-schatzi I'm going to take the side of Jolie. She could have made the media splash a self promoting thing. In reading her words, they are carefully chosen to teach others something about BC and what may save their lives. No other actor has done it this way. Her work with the United Nations for years is well publicized. Any Power person that has done this knows the benefit of a Name being attached to a cause. In many cases the media wouldn't comment on the \"cause\" without the Star being there. Princess Diana, Audrey Hepburn, Matt Damon, Bob Hope, even Mother Theresa, countless others have done this. Jolie's present project with the UN announced the same day, or given media coverage on the day of the BC thing, is on the Un's initiative to bring awareness of, and fight against the rape of women in waring countries through the Geneva Convention rules. That rape of women in war would be treated alongside other atrocities and the prepatrators be held accountable and punished. Yes, her face and bod are photographed through these political \"shows', but the media is there in part because she is there. I know using Mother Theresa and Jolie in the same sentence sounds out there. But MT did the same thing in her travels around the world. Media would cover where she went. So, she went. This brought much needed exposure to the plight of the poor. Are there women and men today that know more about BC, than they knew the day before Jolie's announcement? Are there more that know about genetic history and Braca genes? Are there more that know that having a first degree relative changes their risk? Are there more that know that there is an elective route? I'll bring the link here again, apply the questions to what she has written. See how many things she taught in the one article. www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opi... Remember we, regretfully, are saturated with all that is BC. What did we know beyond the yearly Mammo, before we got the \"call\". How many posts and threads deal daily with the STUPIDS. Are those STUPIDS less stupid today, I hope. I believe Jolie has hepled. Looking for Jolie's link found an article by another Star, Marlo Thomas. Where would St. Jude's hospital be without Marlo as spokesperson. She's carried her Father's banner. www.huffingtonpost.com/marlo-t... There is an explosion of articles discussing the pro's and con's of the Jolie thing. It's caused allot of ruckus. How many lives will be saved because of the ruckus? Marlo's words, a domino affect. The full article is very nicely written. \"Angelina Jolie sent us a very different message this week: that even though much of her fame and power have been rooted in her beauty (and beautiful body), in making this decision she claimed a different kind of power. Knowing that she carried the BRCA mutation that raised her risk of breast cancer to an astounding 87 percent, she willingly chose to undergo a surgery that forces all of us to rethink our fear: that it's not our breasts we have to worry about, it's our lives. Angelina sacrificed her breasts in order to save her own life - the life of a wife, mother, actress, humanitarian and, yes, movie star. She came out to the world not as a victim but as a woman taking control. She reduced the odds that her children will be left motherless, her husband widowed. With reconstructive surgery, her breasts are still a visible sign of her female beauty - the vulnerable tissue that was removed from within them was only that, tissue.  It's not what was inside her breasts that make her a woman, it's what's inside her head and heart. I'm so impressed with Angelina, not just for choosing the surgery but for publicly asserting her power over her body. Not every woman facing her odds (or a new diagnosis) will make the same choice, nor should she. The point is that we have choices now that we didn't have just a few years ago. The science of genomics has made available amazing amounts of new information. Some of it we can't act on, but some of it we can -- and Angelina did. Now that is power. \"I do not feel any less of a woman,\" Angelina declared. \"I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.\"  as written by Marlo Thomas",

      "Content": "Apr 26, 2014 08:27AM - edited Apr 26, 2014 09:14AM by sas-schatzi HI, Sedakans I had a request from another member by pm as to how I felt about my prophy BMX, that BC was found half way through the process. Family stats were 21 women paternal side. 3 aunts/19 first girl cousins. 12:21 with Cancer. 9:12 BC. Braca 1 & 2  neg. Bad gene. Gene unknown yet. I thought I'd just drop off my story in passing through since I just rewrote it. I'll add here my twin had ER+ BC in 1996. I recommended we have hyster/ BSO. In 1996, Ovary removal was not recommended treatment in that time. I had been following BC at the time in my \"set\" of topics in journal reading. Then there were four family members that developed BC within  2 years. Tamox was being used then to suppress the ovaries. What my years in nursing taught me was to be aggressive. Tamox was still relatively new. We(twin and I) did a pre-emptive strike. Hysters and BSO's each. She survives today. She had 1 node/38.  I had been thinking since she had her BC in 1996 about doing a PBMX. Intensely thought about it for three years before I took action. The following is the story. Copy of PM: member name deleted, sorry for the delay, I was dealing with a new cancer--thyroid. Now in recovery. Re:PMX I am now convinced based on a recent reread of my 2009 path report, that my BC was not missed or was so small that the mammo couldn't see it, and that my BC found 4 months later by MRI was just that aggressive. This is based on the fact that I went from Grade 2 -6 to Grade 3 --8 from jan 23rd bx to feb 18th bmx. less than ONE MONTH. After BMX I asked for a pathology re-look to see if there was a grading error. There was no grading error. It was just that aggressive. If I had not been in the prophy pipeline I'd be dead. Because the mammo was clear. I still have the NED letter that says \"see you next year\". I have NEVER regretted the prophy. I have had pain and physical issues but that was b/c of PS and drugs. Jan 23rd 2009, I was dx'd with a brain tumor, BC, and lost my career in the space of 4hours. Not a good day. My DH was dx'd 3 months after me with Lymphoma. He passed in august 2010. My brain tumor started growing in late 2011. Had it removed mar 2012. It was still benign, but that wasn't known until after removal and pathology complete, but we were pretty sure it hadn't crossed the line yet. The thyroid cancer dx'd officially Feb28th/mar 10th 2014. would have been removed last summer July 2013, if the pathologist hadn't screwed up and \"missed it\" on BX. This one I am going to go to court on. !0 months of delay in treatment. EDIT: reason for court 1. He admits he missed it b/c he did a relook at bx slide and \"saw\"it'. If it were just that I wouldn't consider a suit. next 2. In analyzing the 2nd opinion done comparing line by line with the first pathologist report,  Quest laboratories did 5 stainings. 3:5 are specific to thyroid ca. the three absolutely confirmed the presence of papillary ca with a follicular variant. First, pathologist didn't do any staining at bx or on thyroid at removal. I am lucky though he sent it for 2nd opinion. The staining was available to him, he just didn't do it. Long story on colon polyps, I've been very aggressive on colonoscopies. Last one July 2013, I had a precancerous polyp in that scope. Next scope summer of 2014. If there is another precancerous polyp. There will be a new plan which may include removal of that section, or just continued frequent scopes. That chapter hasn't been written yet. The prophy route saved my life. :) sassy",

He has sent out the proper FDA reports. He has contacted Materials Management. They have been charged with the responsibility of creating a list of items that have polyurethane, isocyanates, or coating on the materials. One citation on the internet identified that the IV caths had an antimicrobial coating. They have pulled the docs \"procedure pick list\" That list contains all the materials that would be used in the surgery for me on 2/28/14. I had already asked that endotracheal tubes, bladder caths, and sutures, drains be evaluated for any common elements as to the IV caths. In the early days of the recognition of latex allergies, we created \"Latex Free \"equipment boxes for use with patients. Essentially this is what is going to be created for my surgery. The greater outcome is there will be a policy written for the entire institution. Products will be identified. Any other patient entering the hospital and ancillary areas will have available the similar materials list that is being created for me, but by the time this is completed all products coming into the facility will be categorized as to composition. That categorization will determine if they should be placed on a LIST of items not to be used with patients with this type of allergy. All in hospital units will have the teflon caths available as an alternate to the polyurethane. Perhaps there will be a change back to the use of the teflon caths for the entire system. This is just a guess, but methinks the teflon caths were more expensive. Very often in hospital evaluation of using new products, price is a consideration. Many elements are considered in the process. Safety is always the first consideration. Then other elements such as ease of use, available manufacturer teaching support, availibility of product etc. If two products appear to match in all areas, price can be the determining factor. There's no longer smoke coming out of my ears. I see this as a very positive occurrence. Positive b/c I didn't die or have an anaphylactic response. In the early days of Latex problems these events did occur. Had I not understood that what was happening was unusual, and the two nurses making the statements re: the caths that they did, I could have entered surgery on the 28th and gotten into serious trouble. I.E. Tracheal allergic response to a polyurethane tube. Uretheral allergic response to a bladder cath. Either could lead to localized tissue damage or a systemic anaphyllactic response.  Drains/sutures used in surgical area could lead to a serious wound response mimicking infection. These events depending on the occurrence could/ would have gone without recognition of causative reason.  Now it's known, and I can tell you there are many people working on a plan. Cool.",

Debated about reposting this here. The information that you will find in the two letters posted on the Toradol thread about mid page include the most important studies related to potential reduction in recurrence. I do not wish to add to your worries. But this info is Evidence Based Research. Some may not be interested, others will dive in and become immersed in it. Another BCO member asked for thoughts and I wrote this to her this morning. Thought of you all. Hi (member name deleted), Hugs and welcome back. Sorry that you are back to worrying. Hang tight and continue to work the problem. I'm going to link to a thread I worked on this summer. If you have surgery the info there is very important. They're are numerous studies. Can be difficult. The key is that Toradol given at time of surgery may be associated with reducing recurrence. Also, the use of blocks and opiods can influence recurrence. It has to do with inflammation, release of tumor cells at time of excision, circulating tumor cells present at surgery, and tumor cells that have already embedded at a distant site but are inactive till stimulated by the inflammatory cascade during surgery and in the post surgical period. I'm sure you are shaking your head already. Trust me it's doable. One of the gals Falleaves has written a letter that identifies the top studies, that can be copied and taken to your doc. Please, don't just depend on the letter. You need to understand the info. Falls, 123JustMe, and I did a round robin on linking the three topics. Reading the entire Toradol topic is important which you will see why when you plow through the material. Great way to spend your New Years--studying. Bless you. This link is to a page that includes two Doc letters. MIne and Falleaves. They both encompass what the need to know info that should be communicated to the Doc and Anesthesiologist. Read the letters first before diving into the other material. It will help you focus on what's being discussed. Analogous to reading and abstract before reading the full study. Post any questions you have on the Toradol page. :) https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/73/topics/833612?page=7#post_4496841",

      "Content": "Sep 15, 2017 07:15PM - edited Sep 15, 2017 07:17PM by sas-schatzi Just found this thread. Just because titanium is the most unreactive metal within the body, doesn't mean it's not the causative source. Let's just accept that weirdness happens. I learned through observation and good detective work that I'm allergic to polyurethane IV catheters. Was it stark no. Just caused tissue necrosis at entry. Looked like a three to four day old entry site after 24 hours with the insertion only being from 5-30 minutes. Took weeks to heal versus < than hours. I'm fine with Teflon. Is this happening nationwide. Unknown. Hahaha I'm superlative at detective work. What does poor Jane doe know about IV catheters and questions to ask and how to evaluate IV sites. The point being jdp, is you are in the ballpark. Recent cause and affect application of trouble shooting after all has been ruled out is a reasonable approach. If the titanium is removed and symptoms disappear within a year without any other factors being altered. Then you have a causative agent. A year is arbitrary. The immune system once disturbed is/ can take time to calm down. Sometimes it never calms down. BUT if the titanium serves no present purpose. Then removal is an option They may state that removal may cause further problems i.e. infection potential by a perceived non reactive agent. Just because it is the most nonreactive metal doesn't make it an absolute. For those that object to that statement, relook at the detective work that has been done on her case. If you can offer suggestions for other things to be studied, do so. I was given radioactive Iodine in 2014 for thyroid cancer. I think I'm through it's side effects. I did make a declaration at one point and was proven wrong. Was my reaction normal. OF COURSE NOT, but was I able to potentially change the world, yes. Because I alerted the controlling body on the drug that wrote the protocols for use. It was fun. No one picked up on the absence of skin protocol since the late 40's when it started to be used. Can one person make a change? Can on person ask the right question? Can your wife be one in a million with this complaint? Possibly, but then if it works out for her, someone will write a paper. It falls under the category of case study. From case studies, others look. Either doc's in specialties or researchers that do studies. Go for it, if she's willing.",

      "Content": "Aug 2, 2011 08:57PM - edited Aug 2, 2011 08:58PM by sas-schatzi Bedo--I'm an Identical. My twin had estrogen supported BC in 1996. I'm a nurse. I had a Hyster / bso(ovaries out). I suggested she do the same. She did and is now a 15 year survivor with chemo and no further treatment. It was not the recommended treatment of the time. It know has much support , but I gather that it is still controversial. My BC was dx'd officially by bx in 2009. Mri was DEC 2008. Clean Mammo Aug 2008. I had a horrendous fall in Sept of 08. Hit everybody part except elbows. Falls or trauma are not supposed to be associated with BC. Who knows if this had anything to do with it rearing it's ugly head. I was going for a bilat bmx after many years of thought. Very strong hx traced to paternal grandmother. Stats are off the chart. So our situation is totally different. What we did find out was that there was a Genetic counselor at the major cancer center in our state. There was no cost to me to go through the process. The genetic counselor was thorough, but I feel did not get that there was \"something unusual about that side of the family. 3 paternal aunts------2 of three had BC, one had a ca of the thumb that should have only been found in the lung\". All kinds of people came to examine her thumb before it was amputated. Of nineteen first girl cousins 11 have had cancer on my generation--9 BC. Of 24 first male cousins only one has had cancer to date. Obviously, something is wrong. I believed I avoided BC as long as I did b/c of the hyster/Bso. The women have ranged in age from 40-74. The 2 aunts were in late 60's and early 70's. The cousins range from 40 to 64. One other cousin and myself being 59 and 63 at onset, The rest were 40 to 46. (youngest is a guess) None of this started to show up until the mid 90's.  I thought about the BMX for years. Talked with PCP for three years. Then decided to do it. Why then, so seriously. I was pushed from within, call it what you will, I call it divine intervention. All mammo's were clear and for some reason received the clean mammo letter from August after I had the MRI in DEC. ??????Unknown why the delay. Told at time of Mammo it was clear. So, I didn't worry. But there was trauma to my Nipple from a flip binder that caught it just before the Mammo, the pain persisted for months and then the fall. Since getting approval for an elective is so difficult, the ONC used the Nipple pain as cause for the MRI. BINGO there it was. The pathology report said that the IDC included a tract up to the nipple.  GO figure.  I do worry when I read off women wanting a nipple sparing MX, but I am projecting b/c of my own experience. See if there is a major cancer center in your state that is doing counseling. But remember what I have told you. When we had our last group counseling--I had two cousins on skype and speaker phone who are also RN's. One had a mom and sister with BC and said she had less than x(think it was about 13%) CHANCE OF OCCURRENCE. That blew my mind in light of total family hx and her immediate family hx.  The counselor was using the chart that is most widely used in the USA. I wish the woman that produced the analysis was really looking at our family hx. Somehow I believe she would have said \"WHOA wait a minute.\". All that were tested for BRAC were negative. Two cousins in one family , their parents were tested and it indicated it came from the paternal side. My one cousin , a sister of the two in one family that had Bc contacted the woman that identified the BRAC genes. She was told that there were identical twins and that tissue samples were still available from my twin. Also, that I was willing to undergo any type of testing they wanted including BX, in the furtherance of science. I felt that if I developed BC, then a before and after look of tissue or whatever might lend to some clue. ------Two calls over several years. Each denied. Then I subsequently developed BC. Was it a scientific loss, don't know, pre BC data not available. You are Fraternal twins, your genetics are different. Fraternal twins are essentially two pregnancies. Two separate EGGs being fertilized. Whereas, identicals are the same Egg that at a point of splitting(the egg splits geometrically>2>4>8>16 etc) become two separate babies with the same placenta. Absent of a family history, a genetic counselor is the one to consult.",

The flu vaccine is determined by a group that meets in a European country(forget which) in Jan of each year. They review data from previous years and present data. They choose three viruses to target that year. Then the pharm companies develop the vaccine over the next months to be ready by Sept. They HOPE they have chosen wisely. According to the last CDC MMWR that I read within the last week or so. This years vaccine is only 10 % effective. Earlier this year it showed a higher effectiveness rate, but that has decreased with time.. Even in a stellar year of choice of viruses, a 60% effectiveness is considered great. This year missed the mark.",

I inadvertently found a source of light interfering with my sleep. The street light that I very, much appreciate at the end of my drive. It baths the whole front yard in this yellow light. Also, the bedroom. How I figured how it was affecting my sleep, is when I put the hurricane shutters up. I slept so good in the absolute dark room. Those shutters have never come down. Thank you, for all your suggestions",

Itching can be normal as a healing process and it can be abnormal. One tissue disruption, or two can be a symptom of something else. 2012-On my craniotomy incision with the tissue disruption. The whole thing the way it was done, caused just awful itching. Forehead and scalp. Now 2017, not so much. The first year was lots and lot's and , more lot's, but I expected it and worked with it. Less each year after the first. Probably sucked for the first several years. Yes, sucked big time. But now I'm beginning to forget what I call the \"troubled time\" Other's may say whatever about my phrase. But if you heard the story you'd puke. I'd rather just say the troubled time. This is your troubled time, If you really think it's the Titanium that was left in as a marker. Hells bells it's your body. It could be just a healing thing or it could be a sensitivity/allergy thing. SWG I know we talked something let me go back and look. I know it's within the last couple of days Duh.

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

That's how I found this whole site originally. They give the most understandable info. Since your appt. is tomorrow, you may just want to let it go tonight, but who knows your adrenaline is pumping. But even with as good as BCO's explanations are, you will still ask your surgeon ----who, what, when, where, why, what do you recommend, what other options do I have, Are you offended by 2nd opinions(know of one doc that dismisses his patients, if they get a 2nd opinion--learned this thru an ONC---said \"well he's off the list for a first consultation\") Tomorrow if you can have the 2nd person with you so you can listen, The live scribe recording device that Rockym described. At least ask the doc to talk in English. Tell him simply -you will raise your hand at half mast, if he's using language above you, tell him not to be offended , but you need to understand his words. If you start with this and say it pleasantly with a laugh , he/she will catch on soon enough.  Druanne-------find the religious segment on BCO that you are affiliated with , they can be of great support.

The estate finishing took prepartion, but then was accomplished so simply, I was even amazed. My FIL's estate took something like 9 years to finish. The family wouldn't have had a clue where to begin, but one of his and mines last talks was to ask him to write a simple list of what his assets were, his insurances, etc. They found this list in the top of the safety deposit box. My BIL by marriage not his son, was furious when I described the story to them. He said why would FIL tell you anything. I said you don't get it, I talked to him and pointed out if the family didn't know what to look for then they may miss items. I said that none of you took the time to ask these very important questions. That one list saved unknowable amount of time searching. The length of time to close the estate was because he had asbestosis. The executor sought all allowable recompense for this which is why it took so long. Apple So sorry for all your troubles. My time here for the forseeable future will be limited , I will check in when I can. Native Mariner and She have kindly said they would watch the site. They each have great insight, knowledge and common sense. This site has been pinned so there may be more \"traffic\". I intended it to be just as you described--practical stuff that while we don't like to think in these terms--If we don't, the troubles can be daunting in the aftermath of a very troubled time. WE each should try too make a passing of a loved one as untroubled in all areas as possible. When we are greiving we don't need more trouble. Blessings Sheila",

Try and obtain copies of their genetic testing before talking with a lymphoma  specialist. Try a google search -search term Lymphoma and leukemia society. They may be of some help. In my own family, there is a genetically linked something as yet unidentified for the females on my paternal side for CA particularly BC. The numbers are staggering, yet the genetist counselor used a standard chart that has a reknowned name attached to it--of course I can't remember it. What she failed to do was take a look at the total number of women who had BC in our group. Way off the charts. I had 2 rn cousins in on the consultation report by Skype and phone. The numbers --or stat probability was reasonable based on this accepted experts work. I am sure that if the expert had been privey to our family history she would have said WHoa--we need to do some special testing. To me it is analogous to the woman who identified the gene for Huntingtons Chorea.  She was a desendant of Arlo Gutherie and a genetist. She chose the field because she knew of the genetic linkage with HC, but that linkage was not yet proven by science. It was only empirically known, which means it could be traced in the family tree.  A family was identified somewhere in South  America that had a large number of family members with the disease. She studied it and found the gene.At the time of my reading she herself chose to not be tested for the gene--she didn't want to know and was very open aboutit. Well are family has that kind of micro group. But it hasn't triggered anyone wanting to take blood samples from all living family members--duh. The woman that identified the BRAC! and BRAC1 was consulted by one of my cousins. ONly cousins that already had BC were asked to submit hx's ,Path reports, and tissue samples if still available.  When The genetist that id'd BRAC's  was made aware that there was identical twins one with BC one without. My sister received the communique for info . I was never contacted. My cousin tried twice. She told her I was willing to do whatever , including a breast bx if that would help, send mammo flims and reports . NED at time. That was several years ago. What a missed opportunity because then I did develop the disease. They could have looked at the genetics of it pre disease and post disease. AND maybe there would have been something.  I have read my sis's pathreport and --splat --can't remember anything except we were bothe ER+ with the rest negative and opposite breasts. MY oncotype dx score was 30, but no other cousins had that particular test done as it wasn't available when they were dx'd One very positive thing, when I sent out word to the family that I had Bc, I requested all consider being tested. One cousin from the maternal side was tested that month--they found BC. She had a mx and is doing well. She had a sis with BC and a father  with colon CA. There were multiple CA's on her paternal side. They also likely have some genetic linkage. No one is interested in following that either. GO figuire ---it's basically Medallian genetics---follow the tree.  Need to go post something on the LE site---Namaste Sheila",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

Also, many cancer centers have their own foundations that provide assistance, but they don't necessarily tell you unless you ask. One Foundation we found out about provided 2000,00$per patient grant, but the money couldn't be used for anything medical. It had to be used for groceries, utility, mortgage, taxes etc.--well it definitely got used.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

      "Content": "Nov 15, 2013 01:20PM - edited Nov 15, 2013 01:32PM by sas-schatzi Suggestions re: grief After several disasters in the early 80's , it was found that strenuous physical activity after an event within twenty four hours, that it had a major impact on how someone recovered  physically and psychologically. This was with EMS personnel, but I've found that it works well in the grief situation too. The effects were measureable up to a year later.. Sorry that sounds so clinical, but a bit of exercise day after a death will clear the mind and help begin the healing process. Another thing that was found is that people wanted to pull away from their usually activities. and that it was important to allow time for grieving , but to keep involved too. Here the natural tendency is to want to take a break or leave entirely the things that the person was involved in. Real thoughts and feelings,  The exercise helps to produce endorphins. What was found, not intentionally at first, that when EMS personnel showed up after the first disaster with so much depression and PTSD. It was recognized that something needed to be done . A whole team was assembled from far reaches to evaluate. When the next disaster occurred they went to work. By the third they had a plan and follow up. They also provided the bosses with guidelines to watch for in their people that would indicate grieving was not going well. The worst case scenario that was identified, was the outcome of no intervention was severe depression with the emt/medic leaving the field for good within a year. From that beginning, came the \"Critical Incident Debriefing\" as it is used today. Whenever you hear of teams being brought in to offer counseling after an event. It came out of that research. The concept was to exercise first, then give the individual the time to talk through their feelings, then give them the tools to prevent depression, and allow for continued follow up to prevent long term problems. BUT The finding of the exercise was the surprise. Don't remember exactly how it fell into the plan. I just remember the presenter was very excited about this, b/c it hadn't been previously identified. There are many very good publications on grief. Offering this here in addition to those that you may have on hand already.  ",

In a do over I would have been more aggressive in his care by his docs. It would not have changed his outcome, but there may have been fewer errors. One thing I did learn towards then end was that as his mind started to change, he was unaware of how much medicine he was taking and he didn't follow my directions on not driving. I took all controlled substances and car keys and wore them in a fanny pack on my belly day and night. I had a small book that was in the FP that I could mark down what and when I gave him medicines. It really helped me keep track, And he didn't have to worry that I might not have his pain meds with me. For simplicity, I kept my drivers license,creditcard andsome cash. Therefore , I didn't have to carry another purse.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

      "Content": "Jan 9, 2012 03:21AM - edited Feb 14, 2012 09:03AM by sas-schatzi No one to my knowledge has tested charts yet. They are NEVER washed. They must be a hotbed of bacteria. Think of all the hands that touch them. I believe they need to go through a high temperature wash after each use. If a patient is there over so many days the chart should be changed and sent through a high temperature wash with chemicals etc.-------Periodically, you will see studies that show lots of other things that have been tested, even Doc's ties(awful), stethoscopes, handheld cells, phones, EKG leads, computer keyboards. Other nurses used to laugh at my OCD of cleaning at the start of each shift. I was not only trying to protect the patients, but US. Started with noticing zits, in a certain pattern on my face. I went through puberty, basically, without zits. Then noticed a similar pattern on the other nurses. Cell phones in hospital were handed off to each other at shift change. My research showed a really good study out of Israel on the topic. The four studies from Usa were all lazy studies. They all sited the Israel study versus doing any of their own microbial studies. Except one that sited a study of the Bacteria on EKG leads. Hand wiping EKG leads did little to remove bacteria. The study recommendation at the time was for disposable leads, but they weren't dependable enough at the time. Imagine my horror when waking up after my failed chemo that almost killed me, and they had put on telemetry leads across still healing Mastectomy wounds. Off they came--pronto. The nurse taking care of me reacted in disgust that I was so uncooperative with my CARE. I felt like Felix Unger in the\" Odd Couple\". I'd have a talk with all newbies about cleaning the cells and beepers before handing them off. Even for break coverage, let alown at shift change. Cleaning their medication binders, the computer and Pixis keyboards. Also. nix on fake nails-----horrible. First reports came in 1998. It took several years for it to become the rule. It only happened after Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation made it a \"recommendation\" and that they would be looking for policies  on it. If a doc comes in with a dirty lab coat send him on his way, No hand washing by anyone---speak up. Hand washing should go up to at least 4-5 inches up the arm Jewelry even wedding bands should be outlawed. Watches should be done away with in hospitals. They have clocks in every room. They just need to have a sweep hand to do pulses.  All this stuff can be googled. I should think where else this can be posted. People can't protect themselves against that which they don't know about. All IV poles and commodes should go through a big wash container. Suggested this for the new hospital-------------------------- for OR tables, they did it. iT DID MAKE A CHANGE ON COMMODES:---------after five commode brougth to my mothers room I figured the only way to get a clean one was do it myself. Considering she had aLready coNtracted a hospitaL aquired ======c-diff------ clostridium difficle- THIS INFECTION CHANGED HER LIFE FOR 9 YEARS TILL SHE DIED. -----------FOR OTHERS IT CAN KILL ALLOT FASTER [F  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR DEALING WITH........SHE WENT IN WITHOUT IT . CAME OUT WITH IT----88 diapers a week---------->>>thenhome remedidies worked versus drugs.  Anyone throwing dirty linen on the floor should be retrained. Each room should have it's own linen container ----not taken from room to room , or carried down the hall. Each person should be given there own BP cuff------This is becoming more common. Each person should be given a new phone----This is also becoming more common.  Shoe covers should be used by in hospital personnel, changed after leaving a room that has a known infection----now only done with serious infections that are in isolation status. Not even required by many hospitals for OR people. As there are many more hospital acquired infections, a return to things that were done in a previous time are being looked at for control of the spread of hospiatl acquired infections.  Lastly, I believe that all immuno-comprimised patients should be in reverse isolation for our full hospital visit. That's all of us that are receiving chemo or recently received chemo, but are numbers are \"UP\". Our immune systems are not the same after all the chemicals dumped into us. We need greater protection from what we are exposed too. Numbers being \"up\" doesn't tell the whole story. This one I can't prove by studies. Wish I could. But been there did that , seen it to often that we are more prone to infections based on our life saving drugs like Tamox and AI's. Well this chapter is at an end.",

A conversational thread is a place where wonderful BC women and men talk to you,  and support you with their writing's. In many, many cases the folks , you connect with on the conversational threads become close friends. Sometimes closer than family.

      "Content": "Aug 18, 2012 02:37AM - edited May 21, 2014 04:41AM by sas-schatzi Ginger-It is not uncommon, when people put in an uncommon situation, to act uncommonly. Now I've never said that before, but let's analyse it. It is \"not uncommon\", many people do it. The \"uncommon situation\" I have never experienced it before. Other phrases used, \"it's out of my frame of reference\", \"I'm clueless\". All of these mean, I don't know anything about the problem. I must seek someone that does. I have a plumbing problem, I call a plumber. I have an electrical problem, I call an electrician. I have a, physical problem, I call a doctor. In each situation, I am trusting that the person that I am calling, will correct my problem to the level of working order, before the problem existed. Here on BCO our problem started with Breast cancer. This is our common beginning.  Then because of the initial problem, other problems may and do occur. From our common beginning, uncommon things occur. In these uncommon situations, I am trusting that the Doctor that I am going to will give me the best information. Doctors refer me to other doctors in specialty areas, when the problem presented to them, is uncommon to their knowledge base. I then go to the specialty doc trusting that their knowledge is the best up to date information available. That what they recommend, will correct my problem, do me no harm, and bring me back to the level of health, I was before the problem occurred . Why do people \"act uncommonly\"?  Applying this to our common problem of BC, if I seek information and treatment intervention, and I perceive the information given or the treatment rendered, has caused a problem, I begin to lose trust. When trust is lost or questioned. My action changes. I then seek new information. Until I have enough new information to allow me to trust again. My action may appear to be an uncommon response, to those that have more knowledge than I. Here on BCO, I come seeking new information to validate what the information or treatment, I am receiving is correct. When a problem is posted by a member, other members respond.  Until I can trust again that my information and treatment is correct, I will seek answers. I will pick and chose the answers that resolve my question. A reminder that BCO management team monitors areas of concern of members. Out of this monitoring, many artcles have been added to the educational material on the main board. Reading the articles on the main board should be a first step. Then coming to the discussion board for further discussion of your problem is helpful. The interaction with others that have a common experiences, validates what we know. We then can begin to trust again. Common Law copyright allrights reserved. Aug 2012",

She comforts others even when she herself is in pain and she laughs with a wonderful laugh that is as pretty to hear as any bird singing. She is spiritual but never preachy and draws her strength from nature and will never lose her faith or joy in the beauty of the world around her. She should never be hurt, because she never hurts others. She's got these scars, but is prettier than any perfectly plastically unflawed super model could be, because those scars only serve to remind the ones who love her of how truly beautiful she is and how blessed they are that she is there in their lives. ",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all.

(insert Nystatin powder---that powders good. I'm talking non-medical powders as being a breeding ground for bacteria and fungus --yeast). Sorry we were talking yeast infection in vulva area, not bladder infection. Ironically everything applies. With the addition for both- culture and sensitivity of urine and vaginal opening. Should have mentioned that above, but here it is now. Yeast is a bad neighbor. It is kept in check by the other good bacteria. When antibiotics are taken, they can kill not only bad bacteria , but good bacteria(bug) too. That allows the yeast(bug) to overgrow. Elevated sugar(glucose) levels is their nirivana food, and warm moist environment. Any ways before they give you an antibiotic - try and tell them that you will only take them, if it's based on \"culture and sensitivity\". Culture --they grow the bug to see what it is. Once the bug or bugs are identified, they then test it sensitivity against all the antibiotics usually used for that bug or bugs.  Bugs can become resistant to antibiotics which means the antibiotic no longer works. Also, there is a rating system-- one drug may be a 1 in sensitivity, another may be a 8. The better drug is a 1. It's more sensitive to killing the bug. 8 would be weak. What happens too much, is gists order drugs without testing. You could be taking a drug that the bug is resistant too. The drug isn't doing you any good. Bug wins. OR the drug is weakly sensitive to killing the bug. If the bug is strong enough, it can overcome the drugs ability to kill it.. Bug wins again. Each time you take an antibiotic it affects the whole body. Antibiotics can over time affect the immune system. This is why you want to take a drug that is going to work. Less wear and tear on the entire body and the bug is dead. Know what bug it is by culturing. Know the sensitivity of the bug to the drug.  (lol just made that up it rhymes) ",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan.

These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues.

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

One thing I know for sure that happenned with many banks and credit unions after 9/11 was you were able to add POD or TOD to accounts that previously was not allowed. It took a few years for banks to set up rules. WE did this with our credit union which is our primary institution. But we did not make a provision for something happening to all of us. I agree that it can be a probelm as you have identified. I had three cousins and one 2nd degree aunt from three different families that did just as you described to the detriment of all relatives. Three of the cosignors were were also executors that just raped the estates. In each case they were cosignors/executors for bachelor uncles and one single great aunt. One was a cosignor excutor for her fathers estate.  When dear aunt asked me to take over her affairs and all her money was tied up in CD's with POD. It seemed like a slam dunk that nothing could be messed with. Wrong --each CD had more than one name . Turned out one of the named persons had preceded dear aunt in death by 5 years. She had always described him as the black sheep, but wanted him to inherit anyway. The other named person on Cd was in the last stages of CA and died six weeks after her, but he hadn't told her. All of the CD went to him. But his wife, then inherited twice the amount that dear aunt meant to go to each of her heirs. I know that was not her intent, but nothing could be done. Lessons 1. make sure all heirs are really alive. 2. If  the named person on The CD were ill, would the loved ones wish a change as re: inheritance. 3 IF using CD and TOD or POD as a means of simplifying and protecting against probate--use this \"NAME and to the estate of_____ if NAMED person is deceased\"---I asked at the time if this would have allowed the money to go back to her estate and then be probated.  The bank was unsure, but that was the year of 9/11. The bank wasn't even sure it could be done that way. It's probably clarified by law now. 4. One name POD to a CD. Then I don't know what happens. If all the above applies. I do know dear aunt did not intend for the nephews wife to recieve the money.  Dear aunt and I thought we had all bases covered ---well we didn't , but i learned alot of lessons.",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2010 10:54PM - edited Jun 20, 2011 01:15PM by sas-schatzi Nm.. It was a learning experience, the two that seriously caught me off guard were the one that was dead. She hadn't seen him since 1972 and this was 2001. They other was the one that had CA and didn't tell her, I think the wife was calculating.When ever I called she would always take over the phone, cause he wasn't quite making sense. But no red flag popped up. He never was much to talk on the phone. The worst was I had promised DEAR AUNT , I would be with her in the end. Since whenever she got sick, I was able to always get her fixed. When her time was coming near she kept telling me she was okay, She also sound okay, I didn't have any reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary.  I believe she was ready to die and was afraid I might fix it. She was 92.  She had been praying to ST Therasa the Little Flower to guide her passing. It was actually a joke between us that she couldn't start praying until I had fixed everthing, so there would be no gliches. Then one night I said to her it's okay Mary you can start praying now and we pasted the novena at eye level on her bedstand. I kissed her goodbye. She had many months of good health or fixable health. With visits in between or fix visits. Then I got a call in the middle of the night from the ER she had been taken to. Her K+ was 6.0 she was in renal failure and CHF. IT was a 3 hour drive time. Did they want me to put her on life support. DUH. How did this happen in a vaccuum. After I got over their, I find out she took to her bed 2 weeks earlier. The Director of nurses--DON- to whom I had explained all off the above about being with her in the end didn't call me and tell me of the change. She died alone . First calling my name then calling my DH name . It brings tears to my eyes. I grieved and I suppose I still am. Because I was her POA and Healthcare surrogate,  my place of employment had very early on put it in writing that it met a special circumstance for FMLA. Once she died , they said that special circumstance no longer existed. Well I was going through diverticulitis at the the time and my GI doc said for my health I had to be off the next day(3RD day after death). So, I was able to bury her and settle her estate within 11DAYS, before my own surgery 13 days after her death. I felt the neccessity to make sure her estate was settled before my surgery , in case something happened to me. It all happened because of the way we set it up, except for the 2 that I described. The estate settling all had to do with POD payable on death. I presented the death certificate to the bank. Each heir contacted the bank and followed the banks instructions and it was done. IN a do over ,  I would have established a relationship with the resident who picked her mail up daily.  She's the person that told me what I just described , She would have been my Mole. Even when I asked the nursing staff the same questions provide by the Mailcarrier, They would not provide any thing, even though I was her POA. That sucks big time. WRONG--That was what all the damn paper work was put in place for.  TWO ODD THINGS--my company recognized the special relationship as fufilling rules of FMLA special circumstances for about 3 1/2 years.  I could have taken those two weeks to be at her bedside.  BUT then they tried to deny my right to complete the funeral. Which was actually their right because she was not a first degree relative. If I had not had an illness myself, I know what I would have done, but employment wise I don't know what they would have done. Anyways they made no fuss once the doc's slip was given to them. Mary Adams  born March 13th 1908--died August 9th 2001---much loved and missed Namaste SAS",

Informational/teaching  threads  which this one is and conversational threads. Deanna 's suggestion of starting your own thread or looking at the forums for a thread where people are effectively talking to one another. I will look at the forum list and see if there is already a thread . going that I could suggest Deanna is right on mark with the suggestion to ask for a referral to a breast surgeon. Talking with your husband may be the thing to do, it depends on you. Each Significant Other relationship is different, only you know him/her well enough to know if you should tell him/her now or wait. I definitely suggest you don't talk with the kids until you have a definitive diagnosis and that can only be done by a biopsy as Deanna said. It's an emotional roller-coaster ride. The kids can skip this ride until you have all the details . Same with others. There are likely some close that you will want to confide in, but news travels fast.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

BCO gives us the best, but they don't give us everything,  What's the answer? Edit 8/18/12 Well this is what we call a rant or venting. I would delete this post, but viewing it at a different time. It's not who I am , but obviously very upset at the time. So, I will view it as a teaching tool. BCO allows us to say what we need too. That is very healthy.",

Move to place you want to leave link. I usually make it the line below where I have ended typing. like here 5. Hit clrl-v---it'll print the URL/web address. 6.This is the key that will make it hyperlink>>>put the cursor/ flashing bar at the end of the URL/web address, and hit enter. That should cause link to turn it blue. That enter is the KEY. if you don't do that, you have a url but it won't link/work. \"AH hah Watson I think I have done it\" I'm going to repost this a couple of places and see if it helps others. If you have a different system this may not work Let me know. Good Luck. Sassy",

The amount of paper that starts flowing your way can be daunting. Having some idea of how to manage can help. I can add a newly learned item. Check with the cancer center that your working with to see if they have anyone assigned to apply for grants for whatever you might be eligible for. We found out  4 months after the neulasta copays were building up that our cancer center would do the paper work immediately after we said we were falling behind in payment because new insurance didn't cover it. Now they are all covered YEAH!!!! that amounts to close to $ 2000.00.  good luck!!!  Please post any new ideas or links to assistance money. Edit:6/6/13 Found two new web sites that are a must to review. One is on saving money on drugs. Start with 'home\" page , then the really helpful page is the \"First time users\" Pg. Link is to home pge. http://www.needymeds.org/index.htm  This next link is dedicated to most of the need to know info regarding work and cancer. BCO has much information on the main board, but this link is much more expansive :) http://www.cancerandcareers.org/en  Per my resource: This is how to make the needymed.org website work or other resources work for you while receiving cancer meds in a cancer center, SPEAK UP and let them know you need financial help, best to do when you have initial contact with CC. What they then do, if they are connected like mine, they go through their resources the same we would, but would be contacting as a a provider. Grant money or assistance can be available under all kinds of circumstances. Do not assume you make too much money or b/c you have insurance, money is not available. If say you get turned down initially, rechecking with organization is a good thing to do should you're circumstances change. :) Edit 8/15/2013: submitted by Shellshine.

Start the process for social security disability. The clock starts running on the day they receive your application. Call local Social Security office- federal government office Ask your PCP or ONC to make a referral for consultation by social worker for evaluation of available resources and financial resources. They will then contact your insurance company and the insurance company will designate who and how they make contact with you.  Or call your insurance company direct and ask what services they have available. Ask for a cancer case manager to be assigned to your moms case and that they call you as soon as possible. Contact your County Social Services office and ask them what services are available. Medicare can be contacted on their web site or 1-800-633-4227.  American Cancer Society 1-800-ACS-2345. Patient Advocate Foundation 1-800-532-5274. Cancer Care 1-800-813-4673. These are just a few. A social worker will have much more. Copies of xray reports may be obtained from the facility that the test was done at, through their medical records office. Your mom will have to go in and sign a release form. and produce a picture identification. If she is unable to do this whomever has power of attorney can obtain records by presenting their POA documents and picture ID. The facility  can charge per page a fee allowed by law. Many diagnostic imaging facilities will provide a cd disc. wait until the report is added to the disc before you pick it up. This may take up to a week. All copies of patients medical record can be obtained in this way. Many oncology centers provide copies of the test they have received from other facilities ---ask Mileage is deductible according to preset rules by the federal government.Ask your tax person Talk to your tax person about gas receipts, they may be used in some fashion iIm not aware of. Please come back and post if your tax person says they can be used. CREDIT CARD--pay off completely every month and you won't have to pay any interest as long as it payed off before due date. The idea behind one credit card is there is one statement with all expenditures. You make a copy from your on-line banking site or keep your hardcopy received in the mail. Recommend to pay off monthly so you don't incur interest. Your recommendation of checking with insurance company re authorization is perfect. Put the companies phone number not only in your calendar book. Put it in your cell phone, and on a card by house phone for quick access. If a company that is contracted with your insurance does not get preauthorization, the insurance company has the right to deny the bill. Contractually if it was their responsibility to get the authorization and they didn't , they cannot turn around and bill you. If they do call your insurance company.This is also why it is important to keep all EOB.s THe EOB tells you what you have to pay. It sounds like you definitely needed preapproval for that consult visit, because you were told to write an appeal. Keep going through the appeals process. But if you didn't follow the insurance rule --you may be stuck with having to pay the bill. MY guess is your doc sent you to an out of network doc for 2nd opinion and your doc didn't get the approval.  Keep working the problem. The worst that can happen is you have a 600.00 bill Thank god it wasn't thousands.  Some lessons are hard. Always get the authorization number from the insurance company for whatever you are calling about. Write it down and who you talked to date and time Great questions Mari Thanks sas",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2010 09:13AM - edited Jul 27, 2010 10:02AM by sas-schatzi Mari,  thanks so much for bringing back memories forgotten about caring for another family member. I took care of both parents and a dear aunt. I learned so much from those experiences that is different than caring for yourself. But much of this will help an individual prepare for themselves. There is a type of small accordion type file---the one I have on hand is called a six pocket file. 1. carry your POA power of attorney document or gaurdianship papers--original, health care surrogate declaration  original with you.at all times. You never know when you may have to use them. If there is a DNR \"do not resusitate\" form same thing. Never let anyone keep your original, they can scan/photocopy and then return to you the original. Keep in six pocket file.  With a \"DNR\" an original has to be posted in a visible place in the home. So, you need to have the doc sign two originals. In the three instances that I had this responsibility, I exercised the resposibilty as need presented. When each of the persons, I was responsible for were, had their mental faculties intact--they spoke for themselves. In each case, there were times that they didn't and I had to direct their care. For example, after placement of a pacemaker on dear aunt , she came out of anesthesia with an altered mental status. They did a CT of the head. They found a brain tumor and wanted to do a brain biopsy. Dear aunt and I had discussed these general types of occurrences. Her stated wish was no. So, I refused the procedure. She recovered from the change of mental status without event---nothing happened. She could have had the brain tumor for an unknown period of time perhaps a lifetime. She had never had a head exam. The change of mental status was immediately after the sedation for the pacemaker. She was pleased I had followed her stated wishes. Three things occurred here. 1. we had discussed what she wanted done in different situations. 2. the proper legal documents gave me the power to talk for her. 3. the documents were on file. You can take your original documents to the hospitals that your mom would be taken to in case of an emergency and have them prescanned into her file. This prevents any delay of establishing your relationship to her legally and your right to know her status in an emergent situation. But still make sure your documents are on your person, not all hospitals are as effeciecnt as the next one. 2 In taking care of their bills.  Online banking is a blessing, autodebit for utilities and Auto pay of reoccurring bills reduces your stress of paying their bills. If they have multiple banks that they deal with --try to consolidate into one bank. Choose the bank with the greatest security in checking your credentials. Dear aunt dealt with six banks, it amazed me how lax some of the banks were on checking and validating my documents of responsibility. 3. Get business cards from everyone you deal with because they have contact persons name address, phone, fax.--put in six pocket file 4.Know where the will, prearranged funeral documents and burial documents, life insurance policies, gift lists outside of will, deeds to property 5 Make a funeral box with the clothes etc  the dear one wishes to be buried in. The funny story with dear aunt was she didn't want a cetain pair of shoes. I couldn't resist asking her why. She said \" I was never comfortable in those shoes\". I said \"I don't think you'll notice\". What a laugh we had at that one. Remember to identify if any jewlery is to be removed. 6.Have Tod or Pod on all appropriate items of monetary value. TOD transfer on death. POD pay on death. Applies to bank accounts, mutual funds, cd's(certificate of deposit) 7.POA should be a signator on the bank account in order to do the banking. If there is a safety deposit box you need to be a signator on it and have a key. 8 Register the death certificate with the county of residence. You will be asked by the funeral director how many death certificates you want. A few will do. In most cases people needing it to complete whatever can make a copy, but you may have to give originals to some. Anyone reading this may offer a suggestion. Time has caused a memory lapse on this.  9. Find out if all heirs are living, the black sheep had predeceased dear aunt by five years.  I'm sure this may seem bizarre to some, but been there 3 x's.  Being a POA for someone is a tremendous responsibilty and being prepared is important. I'm not a lawyer. So, seek the advice of a lawyer re: all above items. Again Mari, Thanks for bringing these memories back, I hope they help. sas",

Native Mariner and She are watching the site. They have great strengths and insight on many subjects. Your question on how to become a POA is different in each state from requirement that it be completed by lawyer to simple notary public. Having this paperwork, plus Will, plus Healthcare Surogate, in place is very important. I would not let my son go off to college without this paperwork in place. If proper paperwork not complete, you have no power to direct a loved ones  care when they cannot. Everyone thought I was overly something. You and your sister need to have these papers in place, by what ever the rules of the state you are in. All family should agree who is to take on the responsibility. There should be a sit down with mom and you and sis, and any family members that your mom wants present and have a serious discussion on what the future holds. What are the wishes of mom  in the worst case scenario. In this discussion, all should clearly understand moms wishes. So, in the situation of a turn of events, whomever has taken on the responsibility is not put under stress by family members to do something different.  If you have accepted the responsibility, you can refer to the dicussion with mom. It will take the stress off of you. The Schiavo case and the Quinlan cases are landmarks. Refer to my story about Aunt Mary.  Need to leave now for sleep__Thanks, Nameste SAS",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

First go to the main board --not the discussion board and locate the section on pathology report. BCO has  the best that I could find explanation of the different components of a pathology report. It's actually how I found BCO. Second after reading all that is offered there, come to the discussion boards >>go to main forums>>>scroll down to \"connecting with others with like diagnoses\". This should get you started. Good luck",

The consideration that better equipment can make you crazy. If the staff said that the machine was outdated, and you were only told of it after. That could be a legal problem. Attempt a legal consultation. Check the forums for the particular hormone that you are on. Each of the hormone drugs have their own nastiness. Women on that particular forum are the best to consult and commiserate with. They can help you cope with what's going on too. What drugs do they recommend for chemo. They're are general chemo groups and specific chemo groups. I suggest joining both. They're is also a Radiation group. It's a whole different thing to deal with. Talking with folks that have direct knowledge of rads is a good thing to do. Where are you being treated at? Are you getting breast reconstruction? Coping, is prayer in your belief system? I couldn't have survived without it, but it is not everyone's way. Please, go back and read from the beginning of this thread. Some is repetitive. As you go along you will be able to slide by the repetitive. You want to talk with someone now. Their is a thread I can direct you too that may help. This link is to a thread where many newbies(you are a newbie) go for support https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/84/topics/833500?page=236#idx_7059 ",

      "Content": "Apr 27, 2013 08:34AM - edited Jul 6, 2013 10:02PM by sas-schatzi If you get the AARP magazine this months issue dated may 2013,  there is a story about the safest hospitals and what safety procedures that are in place that cause them to be safe. The article cites that 180,000 people die a year due to medical/surgical errors AND 400,000 drug errors are made a year. The articles states that these numbers are likely higher b/c these are the ones that are reported. I agree. I know you've seen where I've said on the threads \"Sorry etc for too much info, just want too make you(BCO memebers) safer\". Guess I should stop apologizing for writing stuff in this regard. These numbers are higher then the last set of numbers that I had known. The problem is either getting worse OR there is better reporting. I'll go with better reporting. The article cited that one of the safety items was having an ICU Intensivist. It cited that only 35% of hospitals had Intensivist. I was dismayed at this percentage since residencies for Critical Care Medicine have been available since the 1980's. Truly thought by now that the \"industry\" would have been driven by demand for better care that this statistic would be 70 to 80%. ICU medicine is absolutely in need of a specially trained doc. Just as in all subspecialties of the American Medical Association(AMA), the knowledge and skills of this subspecialty are critical to survival when a patient is at this level of need.  My hope is those seeing this will locate a copy of the AARP article. Read it throroughly. Then question there local hospitals on each item. Based on what they elicit re:safety of each facility, they can choose the safest hospital near them for care. It can mean the difference between life and death, and or avoidable complications. Spreading the word to others regarding this may save lives.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot.

I though it appropriate to add here with qualifying info deleted. :) \"I saw the last page re: ambulance ride. I have the provider side experience with that. The outcome is cost and necessity, worded right you owe nothing. If your call was determined that you needed transport by ambulance, there are two systems 1. EMS county/or city is the primary responder and transports in all situations ...OR 2. EMS county or city is the primary responder and contracts with a private service, to transport non -life and limb threatening transports. Each is covered by insurance. But each will try to bill you as an individual. The county/ city service bills insurance to try and recoup cost. If you receive a bill after insurance payment from the county or city, respond with \" This was covered by my taxes, advise further why my taxes didn't cover this transport when the responders determined that transport was medically necessary\". Bill will go away. If the bill doesn't go away, call your council person or the EMS Community Relations Specialist. With the transport by a private company. Once county or city Ems personnel releases you to a private service. The private service will try to get you to sign a responsibility for service form. Don't. Big time don't. Reason. The transport was recommended by the Primary Responder of EMS. That means that there was a need based on assessment for transport. Medical Necessity. They have contracted with the county/city service to provide medical transport in non-life or limb situations. They are double dipping. Of course, they will always describe that they are loosing on there costs. If you call a private service, you are bound by their costs.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

Ranks the 50 worst and 50 best insurance companies. I'm changing companies b/c the company I had was AWFUL to deal with on a claim in 2013. Now I find out they rank the worst of the top 50. These insurance companies cover a mix of HEALTH, car, homeowners, and flood(administered for FEMA). See how your company ranks? http://www.badfaithinsurance.org/indexdetaillist.h... This link is to another page on FBIC---Fight Bad-faith Insurance Companies web site. This page has a listing of all 50 states that link to each states Department Of Insurance--DOI. If you study the 50 worst and 50 best page>>> then go to the State DOI page, it's VERY INTERESTING. http://www.badfaithinsurance.org/doi.html This link on FBIC is to all kinds of agencies under specific topics http://www.badfaithinsurance.org/links.html There's also, a link to flood insurance for each state on their DOI page. I've had flood insurance since 1998, it wasn't required just made me feel good. But it's managed for the government by the company that has my homeowners. Going to change that too! It seems that when you get flood insurance the plan manager for FEMA ends up being the same company as you have your homeowners is through. The question that arises from that : If the insurance has a reputation of \"DENY, DENY, DENY\" a claim, how does the same company managing your flood insurance respond in an adjusters evaluation? ------------------------------------- More research UGH! It's a learning process. May be TMI, but what I've learned is trying to find a company that can be trusted is VERY VERY hard. One of the companies suggested a couple more consumer type web pages that independently evaluate insurance companies. They felt that the FBIC reponses were from people that had only negative things to say about a company. It's not that I agree that these companies are any better at evaluation, I felt I should add them here as another option to review. Frankly, at this point I'm frustrated b/c these sites counter what FBIC states. No clue really who to believe. This link is to MSN MONEY. It's posting of the top 15 companies is based on Insure.com survey results. http://money.msn.com/home-insurance/best-home-insu...",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

Clicked on \"sent\" and we found the PM. LOL I did a cut & paste from my own PM site as an example. Then clicked to see connection. Took me to my millions of PM.s Deleted it.

Love ya'll Repost from Warm and Fuzzies. not appropriate to the site , but there were a couple of bladder leaking meme's. But this is a serious story has to do with the funny one about bladder leaking. All the docs will tell you about kegels. WELL, I inadvertently found a solution if you are a swimmer. There is a swim stroke that I can't find the name for which I learned as a kid. It's meant to be a stroke to reserve energy if lost in the water and have to swim a long distance. I have been using it more frequently b/c I had a shoulder injury and was working the deltoids. LOANDBEHOLD. The stroke increases bladder control. Takes maybe 2-4 weeks, but dependent I'm thinking on how often you use the stroke. I vary 3 strokes for particular reasons. Then I noticed better bladder control. It's a back stroke. You bring up the arms from the side to the top. At the same time you bring up the legs in a frog position. Then you snap them down and glide. I kept working the movement harder, to get the work out of the deltoids. Then TADA, head slap moment, I noticed I didn't have the run for the bathroom after the pool or the hitting of the air conditioning. It was AMAZING. I know this isn't a funny on a funny page, but I'm posting this in as many places as I can. So, hahahaha. Leaking is no fun hope it helps, spread the word.",

      "Content": "sas-schatzi wrote: My breast cancer was diagnosed in Jan 09. My husband was dx'd with lymphoma in April. The following are some things we learned on our journey. I hope they help. Rather than rewrite everything in sequence, because I missed putting the fax in the rewrite of the outline, I'll put it here. I strongly recommend you get a fax machine. In the very active phase of our diseases, not uncommon to have sent several faxes a day. VACINNATIONS UPDATE ASAP after diagnosis- shingles, pneumonia, tetanus, whopping cough. I'm concerned right now about reports being circulated about problems with the flu vaccine. Personally,, I won't be taking it until further studies are completed. DENTIST check up asap after diagnosis. Generally, can't be done after chemo and radiation treatments start A. Monthly Planner, I prefer the kind you can read 30 days at a time. Allows you see what is going on for the the whole month. More efficient than a 7 day planner. B. Monthly Planner Contents: place names and addresses in the address section of the planner. Write, doctor and secretary name, phone, fax, office hours, address. You, also, can take a business card cut off edges and tape it in. Add all your health insurance info, inclusive of id#,group#, phone#, address. Add anyonesname that you have talked with that affects your condition. Then make a computer copy of all the same. Make individual lists inclusive of all information i.e. a doctor list, insurance list of contacts. Saves time when someone asks for a list. AND the dreadful occurrence should you loose your planner. I was obsessive about putting, this in the carry binder. I kept binder and planner near phone for quick access for medical phone calls. C. Ring Binders for Information Storage: 1.medical information: divide by history & physicals, lab work, diagnostic imaging, consultation visits and report. 2. insurance: explanation of benefits (eobs), and bills. 3.Educational: information that you want to retain, organize to preference. 4.Employment: policies, communications from work, consents, disability: short and long term. File any communications from employer and disability carrier. 5.Social Security Disability: application, communications, award letter. This will keep you from drowning in paper and make things easier to find. We had nine binders between the two of us for2009. Label binders on front and side D. Carry File Binder: It is very similar to the binder sent out by the breast cancer society, but more sturdy. Put copies of following testing that were SUPPOSED to be already presented to the next doc. It's not a duplicate to ring binders. Copy of initial testing and current informatiom from at least six months. Helpful when doctor hasn't received expected information. I was able to hand it to them. Make sure you get back your original before leaving any office 1.Information to include in binder: a. Before most chemo's/and radiation, they will want you to have a bone density. Put in the first bone density ever done, this is your baseline. Put in last study done before the radiation. Have PCP evaluate this in depth to track baseline compared to newer studies. Keep for the remainder of treatment. Bone density is adversely affected by many treatments. Needs to be reviewed as new studies are done, by comparing to older studies b. Blood work--try and have labs all drawn at same facility. Ask them to run them so each week or month are in columns side by side. This makes it very easy to follow trends. Our Oncology center does it this way. Also, make it easy to keep only last 12 months on few pieces of paper. If you go to other specialists, write their lab results on this lab profile. Take labs no longer needed in the carry binder and put them in your medical into ring binder. c. Keep one copy of you bc pathology report in this carrier. d. Keep copy of genetic studies e. EKG, echocardiogram, stress tests d. xray, ct, pet scan, bone scan reports --most recent report E. Diagnostic Imaging Reorts: ask radiology center to cut a cd. Pick up only after docter report added. You'll probably have to wait a week, but it's worth it. Doctors not up to date on how to use cd's will ask for films' You then have to go to the facility and pick up. BUT if you give the facility, that has your films enough notice, they may deliver them to the doctors office for you. They always attach a paper copy to the film, but over time they can easily get lost, Getting and keeping a copy of these xray papers is important. Avoids fraud when they say they can't locate previous records. It's amazing how many screw ups are covered up by the phrase--\"no previous films to compare to\". Story: I found out they were watching my bc site for years when I went back through old records(10 years approximately) . BUT then when it became an issue the mammo's \"had disappeared.\" They denied they had been watching anything. WELL I have sequential copies that states they were watching, but I haven't decided what to do yet. F. Medication/ Allergy List: carry list in folder that you can hand them at entry of new visit or follow up. It gets old rewriting each time. Get original back before leaving office. G. Mileage: list from day one, to and from any doc/pharmacy/diagnostic center for tax purposes at end of year. Use a page in the monthly planner. Top of page:destination, miles(determine from mapquest. For taxes run copyof Mapquest, include in tax file. Make file for mapquest copy. I've used the same file for 3 years. Recopy for next years taxes. H. Receipts: Container to put in all receipts related to out of pocket payments for tax purposes. Copies of all checks written for medical treatments, pharmacy, otc items. Keep separate from household stuff, avoids sorting at end of year. I. Pharmacy mail order: Use your insurance companies mail order company for drugs.We made a huge money mistake by not using the insurance companies designated pharmacy-HUGE. At the end of the year ask for a computer run of of total spent at each pharmacy for tax purposes. Easier on tax person. J. Consultation Appointments: When someone says\" Trust me we always get the information there-\" DO NOT believe. Walk into any consultation with the informatin that the consultant needs to do their consultation. Saves you from a wasted visit and wasted money. Make a packet from your originals consisting of initial History and physical, last set of doctor notes, xray fims/cd's, labs 6months , genetic studies etc. Remember, I said make a packet, do not expect to get originals back. Big centers don't have time to make copies of your originals. Story: One time after a 2 1/2 hr drive to a big cancer center. They had nothing. This was after the cancer center guaranteed they were sent. I called the day before to the consultation center, the responding person guaranteed that they had them. I faxed a copy of all the same data myself. Think I was safe, no. The big time specialist opened the file and nothing was there, not asingle piece of paper. BUT I knew this would happen. So, I had made a second package as described as above. Did this when I was preparing the fax that I sent, the day before, with a cover sheet, identifying myself as patient and referring doctor and addresses. I handed the doctor every single piece of data he needed. Then after making my own package, I refiled all my master copies in my carrier or ring binder as applicable. Being able to hand that package to the doctor can get things moving fast. Of course, the ideal would have been for them to have prestudied the data, but I think that falls under magical thinking. Consultation Visits -follow up to make sure they send their findings. With all they have to do, it can take overlong to get their written report. You may not have the time to loose. Add copy to carry file and ring binder K. Ledger Book: Record debit/cash payout, as a company uses to see where the money is flowing. Can help if you find grant money. Section by month with sequential household and medical expenses. or separate sections for household and medical.--This sounds good, but I couldn't keep up with it. L. Social Worker Consultation: Visit to see what services and money etc. you are eligible for at the beginning, i.e right after diagnosis or first treatment. If they ask you questions that you are uncomfortable answering, ask if they are required i.e. mutual funds. Don't be afraid to say that you are uncomfortable. The social worker will inform you what is required and what is not required. Story: We did not have this type of visit until 1yr 1mos after everything started. We were eligible for all kinds of assistance and missed out. i.e American cancer society will assist with pain medication, but will not cover retroactively. The Lymphoma society will assist and will cover some things retroactively if it's in their calendar year. BCO main board has numbers regarding assistance programs. M. Notice of meeting copay limit: Watch for the statement on your EOB's that says you have met your copays/deductibles. Have facilities scan it into there systems or copy. Get original back before leaving office. Keep in carry file. Story: We missed mine by 2 months and my husbands by a month. We then had to recollect from each provider. If it was the reverse, they would have been sending us to a collection agency. Have a copy in your carry binder. Ask them to enter it into there system. This may still not work. Thats why you want to carry a copy that says you have met all copays and deductibles in your carry file. N. Authorizations: When a company is checking on your copay, and you have meet your copay/deductibles. The question, they need to ask is\" HAS THIS PATIENT MEET THEIR COPAYS/DEDUCTBLES\". VS WHAT IS THE COPAY\". This is a good time to pull out your statement that you have met all copays/deductibles. Obtain authorization number from insurance company before having a procedure done. Otherwise you may get stuck with a big bill. O. Cancer fax file: You will be faxing the same people all the time. Make a file. Obtain someones form that has the HIPPA privacy statement on it. Black out there company name. Write the name of your contact person, write in big numbers their fax number, your name and phone, then below where all the lines are just put the date your sending and re:X i.e. lab update. I've used the same sheet many times. Saves time /paper/frustration of making out knew form each time. Three and half years later I am still using the same file. P. Review Accuracy of Medical Information: of all physician history and physicals, and notes. One doctor put in a serious WRONG diagnosis and it took six months to get it corrected. Once they screw up, it's in the computer world and will affect all future contacts. Q. Mental health: PTSD and depression are a problem of dealing with cancer. Consider working with a therapist early on. Please, don't hesitate on this one. This one didn't hit my radar until I realized both of us were seriously depressed. R. Self Preservation Care: Get prayer networks going, pamper yourself, exersize as allowed, gather as often as allowed with friends and family. During chemo avoidance of contacts in a reduced immune state is necessary. Keeping contact with close ones will dispel the feelings of required isolation that is for your own safety. Read a lot of jokes, tell alot of stories, try to do the things that make you happy. Many inspirational books available S. Legal Issues: You will probably need a lawyer to review many of these. There are online sites, but risky if you miss something or don't get it right. The key is to set up every thing as to avoid probate. This is practical. You could pass at anytime from BC or falling down a set of stairs. Avoids chaos. 1. Trusts(should also have a will even if you have a Trust, handles unforseen things not covered in the Will), Wills, Durable Power of Attorney(DPOA), Health Care Surrogate Power of Attorney, Living Will are up to date. 2. Names on bank accounts include spouse. May want to include adult child name. This may be important if you can't do bills yourself. Set up as much as possible in online banking. Downside if someones's sued your assests may be attached to a settlement. Better to be handled by DPOA. 3. Beneficiary designation: Check all insurance policies, banking accounts, mutual funds, checking,savings, money market funds, compushare for beneficiaries are designated per instituition policy a. Transfer on death TOD b. Pay on death POD 4. Review Deeds to Property and Assets: house, car, boats etc. and rights of inheritence 5. Safety deposit box:determine signators for access. Location of the keys. 6. Have list that identifies all assests, and a second list of what's in the box. Allows POA/Signator/ Executer to know what assets you have and what's in the box.. Essesntially, works as a checklist. 7. Ma111 's thread an excellent resource \" A place to talk to death and dying issues\" . It's in Stage IV Forum.The information is universal to all. Preparation is for all. This was the lesson learned from 9/11. Many laws in the USA were changed as a result. T. Immunizations--As soon as you get the diagnosis and BC plan. ASK about immunizations before chemo/rads------FLU, Pnuemovax, Shingles vaccines. These can't be given in a reduced immune state. ------------------------------------------- The below link is to MA111's Topic: A place to talk death and dying issues. Pg 25-26 have a synopsis written by BON a BCO member. Being prepared should be considered by all, not just when illness strikes. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/770023?page=1 This link is to atopic thread \"TIPS ON SHOPPINGLIST FOR CHEMO\" Great and practical info,very little overlap to this thread--definitely worth a read. http://community.breastcancer.org/topic_post?forum_id=69&id=706846&page=1 All these statements are from experience, that I won't give more details than I have. I'd be here writing forever. Have faith, have hope, cry and rant when you need to, love alot. Blessings and prayers - sassy Life's journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out shouting \"holy crap....what a ride\".

The MO is the one that will determine what your treatment should be from here on out. If you don't have a MO, ask for a referral. The breast surgeon should not be figuring it out. Surgeons are cutters. MO do the overall medical management. MO's will determine risk. MO's determine chemo recommendation. Mo's determine whether radiation is appropriate and then would refer you to a Radiation oncologist.(RO). But will still be doing the OVERALL management. MO's are the center of your treatment for the next few years. Good Luck. Try when you can to look at this thread from the beginning as time goes by, MANY have offered pearls of wisdom of logistical stuff that helps.

Based on our comprehensive review of new safety information, we are requiring updates to the drug labels of all prescription NSAIDs. As is the case with current prescription NSAID labels, the Drug Facts labels of over-the-counter (OTC) non-aspirin NSAIDs already contain information on heart attack and stroke risk. We will also request updates to the OTC non-aspirin NSAID Drug Facts labels. Patients taking NSAIDs should seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, weakness in one part or side of their body, or slurred speech. NSAIDs are widely used to treat pain and fever from many different long- and short-term medical conditions such as arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, colds, and the flu. NSAIDs are available by prescription and OTC. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and celecoxib (see Table 1 for a list of NSAIDs). The risk of heart attack and stroke with NSAIDs, either of which can lead to death, was first described in 2005 in the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the prescription drug labels. Since then, we have reviewed a variety of new safety information on prescription and OTC NSAIDs, including observational studies,1 a large combined analysis of clinical trials,2 and other scientific publications.1 These studies were also discussed at a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee held on February 10-11, 2014. Based on our review and the advisory committees' recommendations, the prescription NSAID labels will be revised to reflect the following information: We will request similar updates to the existing heart attack and stroke risk information in the Drug Facts labels of OTC non-aspirin NSAIDs. In addition, the format and language contained throughout the labels of prescription NSAIDs will be updated to reflect the newest information available about the NSAID class. Patients and health care professionals should remain alert for heart-related side effects the entire time that NSAIDs are being taken. We urge you to report side effects involving NSAIDs to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the \"Contact FDA\" box at the bottom of the page.",

You run the risk of problems being created by the bacitracin. Topical antibiotic ointments can create more problems than they solve. Problem is the typical s/s's they cause is blistering which can extend to a full blown contact dermatitis. But you have blistering with the probablitiy that more would be evident in the few hours past when seeing the first ones. Follow through with what they've done now. But try and do the following. It's late now, just do what you can My computers acting up. I was trying to get pics to give you a clue what to look for. Google \"Pictures of contact dermatitis and topical antibiotics.\" I was able to get one link from Medscape for you to read. Please, make sure to read :) This is on the topical antibiotics http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735534 If you have a burn in the future or anyone around you. Strip away clothing fast. If there is any delay pour cold water over the area while stripping. If you can't do cold water immersion as I described in my first post, just keep pouring the iced water without ice over the area. You can also place a towel over the area and keep pouring the cold water over the towel. In the event of a grease burn, most commonly on the hand or arm. Run cold water over the burn area and use dishwashing liquid to get the grease off. Then do the cold water immersion. Quick action at the time of the burn is the best to reduce the thickness of the burn---1st, 2nd,3rd degree burn can all be lessened by cooling the burn fast. Real fast. If skin is burned away already though don't do the cooling. 4th & 5th degree burns are beyond the scope here. Activating EMS is better than driving to ER. They are trained to handle burns and have equipment. May seem that it isn't the best use of EMS, but better to take the safest way rather than delay by driving to ER If they want to give you a dressing tomorrow to place over the wound area. Ask about silvadine use or silver alginate. They will be able to determine best product by looking at the wound. If you have a local burn unit, they usually offer outpatient burn care. With this being your LE arm it's a good consideration if one is close. Good Luck sassy......... I'll check in tomorrow.",

      "Content": "Jun 18, 2016 09:57AM - edited Jun 18, 2016 10:07AM by sas-schatzi Chi, don't mean to rain , but Tylenol is acetaminophen also known as APAP on scripts. You got it right, but not sure someone else got that from the post. Discussion on dose has been vacillating between 2400 and 4000mg in a 24 hr time period for years. Acetominophen/Tylenol not only has liver effects, but kidney too. When the dose is overwhelming to the kidney liver system in the individual, there can be failure of one or both systems. Not pretty to watch. Hate the treatment-stinks(literally). Titrating to lowest dose is a consideration b/c the science hasn't made up the finale story. If the end story is that 2400mg is the safest, and one has been on the 4000 mg level, damage may not show up for a long time. And by that time the damage maybe irreversible. going to try to decipher the dosing you recommended. Chi from your post \"2 ibuprofen every 12 hrs. is way too low a dose of NSAIDs to maintain a clinically-effective blood level of the drug. It is supposed to be taken every 4-6 hrs., as is ES Tylenol. They are two different classes of drugs, so you don't need to alternate between them (indeed, you are probably wasting your money by doing so). When I was rehabbing after my knee replacement surgeries and weaned off opioids, tramadol and gabapentin, an orthopedic-surgery nurse in the UK who helped found the Bonesmart.org website and moderated its discussion boards came up with a combo she called the \"Bonesmart Cocktail:\" two each ES Tylenol and ibuprofen every 6 hrs. If you want to take an NSAID only twice a day, switch to naproxen sodium (Aleve or OTC generic). You can safely take up to 4 gm. (4000 mg) of Tylenol a day, but some authorities recommend not exceeding 3 gm., especially if you have liver issues. You might want to, instead of two ES Tylenol every 4-6 hrs, take two 650 mg. \"Arthritis Formula\" time-release acetaminophen every 8-10 hr. I take two of those at bedtime and switch to one 200 mg. celecoxib (aka Celebrex, not yet OTC) in the morning--as a COX-2 inhibitor, it is a much gentler NSAID on your gut.\" \"2 ibuprofen every 12 hrs. is way too low a dose of NSAIDs to maintain a clinically-effective blood level of the drug. It is supposed to be taken every 4-6 hrs\" What mg strength are you talking about? OTC or prescription strength? Total dose in 24 hours is? ES Tylenol is 500mg. Brit gal recommends 2 every 6 hours= 4000mg/24hr. Plus Ibuprofen assuming OTC @ 200mg q 6hrs for 800mg /24. Right? Tylenol be a bit suspicious of and careful. Choose the lower end of the dose. Arthritis formula timed release acetaminophen-- 2 every 8hrs @ 650 mg = 1300x3= 3900 mg. Right? \" celecoxib (aka Celebrex, not yet OTC) in the morning--as a COX-2 inhibitor, it is a much gentler NSAID on your gut.\" No Celebrex is not gentle. I'll bring back the black box warning and it'll scare the shit out of you. First the general NSAID warning in the next box. Then the next box after that the Celebrex black box warning.",

      "Content": "Sep 27, 2014 06:54PM sas-schatzi wrote: Glennie, I was rereading the posts over the last two pages. It's a perfect place to add a description of \"Surgical Stress Response\". The body undergoing any sx procedure perceives it is being attacked. The body has many protective sensors that transmit info to the brain. When the sensors indicate trouble -i.e. real or perceived. the brain interprets the signals and activates all kinds of things within the body. This is a very simplified description of the \"Negative Feedback Mechanism\"(loop mechanisms). How this occurs in the body is so absolutely amazing. One of the mechanisms causes the body to decrease urine filtration through the kidney. This reduced function of the kidney is VERY advantageous if being attacked by a saber tooth tiger, but now can interfere with recovery after sx. This reduction of filtration allows the body to maintain volume. What the anesthesiologist does is use a smorgasboard of drugs & fluids to trick the body/ brain into not closing down systems that need to keep working. Generally, lots of fluids are used from pre-op>>OP>>post-op to trick the body/brain. A usual expected affect is fluid retention. So, in the case under discussion of your particular position in sx with a 30-40 degree head down position, add to that that the anesthesiologist is working to fool the kidney/ brain etc. it may make it clearer why people appear to be puff balls after sx. Even when the surgical table is flat. What then happens after the sx is over, the bodies loop mechanisms are assessing the balance of the body. Once the brain decides the threat has passed, it sends chemical & nervous messages that cause the body to come back to balance(homeostasis). This can start from hours to days. In the case of fluid retention, once the brain decides it's not threatened anymore. Chemical/nervous signals are sent to the adrenals & kidney. This causes the kidney to start dumping extra fluid. Peeing like a race horse is the typical description. May occur in hours. May not occur for days. May have to be \"encouraged\" by a diuretic(water pill/shot). What can you do to help :) Note your weight on your home scales just before you leave home, and at the hospital in the preop area. They are usually different. But if you have had nothing by mouth---and your home scale weight is 150 and the preop area scale is 160. That's important. You didn't gain 10 lbs, it's a difference in the scales. Post-op then if you go home, you can accurately track your weight. Your home scale may be inaccurate, but you know what it was immediately pre-op. So, a wrong becomes a right for tracking purposes. Clear LOL?  IF you are admitted, then the pre-op area scale becomes the tracking device. Make sense? Does get confusing if you are discharged the next day. But when the body is under attack mode, consider it will take several days for it to readjust to a balanced state. So, if you are discharged early use your home scale as your tracking device. If post -op you are peeing allot, that's a signal that all systems are ago for coming back to normal YAY!. If there seems to be a feeling of being a puffball and there is little urine output, then the body is still not convinced that all is right. One thing that will cause the body NOT to come back into balance is PAIN. Post-op pain should be well managed i.e controlled post-op. Scale below 3. High pain scale descriptions remember when I said >5-6 chemicals are released that can interfere with wound healing. Pain convinces the brain that trouble is still abrewin'. The brain WILL NOT let it's guard down in the presense of PAIN. Believe it or not PAIN is a protective mechanism. Not seen that way when we are going through it. But in the days of saber tooth tigers and such, yeah, it was.........Think I'll stop here. Reread a few times before sx. Just as a game---I'm terrible. Ask folks as you go through the process  \"Tell me about Surgical Stress Response and what can I expect\".  Report back after with your stories :) Why do I know about it? Serendipity. Not learned in surgery--(4 years), Not learned in all the teaching I'd done on trauma for the next 6 years. How? I was prego and toxic. Searched Toxemia. Toxemia of pregnancy mimics Surgical Stress Response. I'd been in the business for 10 years and never saw the topic written or discussed. That was 1984. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system that controls all this was my favorite bedtime reading---I'm weird. Never once saw it mentioned from a surgical standpoint.  Trauma, life, drugs, oddles of other things. Not surgery. You're Anethesia folks are well versed, perhaps recovery folks. Your stories will tell me abouthow well others know. I know I was still teaching staff nurses that had gone through a 4 year BSN program, and it was never  mentioned  as of 5 years ago. Remember to do your weights pre &post and pay attention to how much you're peeing :)",

The complete absence of pain in a burn is an indicator of a third degree burn b/c the nerve endings are dead from the burn. But the tissue would look way different than you described Still worried that the bacitracin will cause a contact dermatitis. One big blister-- is it the burn or reaction to the bacitracin.  Don't slather---more is not better  :) The suggestion re: Outpatient burn center---St. Barnabas in Livingston is the only accredited burn unit in New Jersey. They have an out patient burn care unit. 973-322-5924. Mon-Fri 8:30-5:00. Seriously, if they are close get a referral for wound care. This is the highest best care that you could get in this scenario. Gold standard. But if they aren't close then.....they aren't. Never know they could be next door :) Your PCP can do follow-up burn care in the office. If this is your choice, I suggest being seen on Monday. Also, local wound care centers are a source for wound care and your PCP will guide you. Sounds like you have a fun day planned. Good Luck! sassy",

Dr Sukhatme does a beautiful presentation of the research done by Dr Forget.and Dr Retsky. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/73/topics/833612?page=19#post_4684309 my last post there today on the Toradol/Ketorolac thread __________________________________________--- Hi, All, received this from Dr. Retsky Look at this video from my coauthor Vikas Sukhatme. He is academic dean at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard. A very smart guy. OK to circulate. Michael https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8zVrYEW8vE&feature=youtu.be ____________________________________________________ This is an amazing video presentation. The fella is brilliant and he makes the info so easy. What's sad is the story of Jennifer. Spoiler alert, Jennifer is his wife. Every concern that we went through in the summer and into the fall for our small group, is addressed in this video. What I think anyone trying to digest this info should request of their doc to review this video. Folks with the knowledge that we gained last year, by talking it out, and flying by the seat of our pants came to the same conclusions that Dr. Retsky, Dr, Forget, and Dr. Sukhatme, we did good. Our research and conclusions were good. Yes, it needs to be confirmed by a prospective study. I hate the thought of a prospective study when the results mean that recurrence could be avoided by a simple < 10$ IV push pre-op. Way back when I said that being on the right side of the change when change is occurring is the side we want to be on. Dr. Forget has a study going in Belgium. Dr. Retsky is working on getting something approved in two other areas. As Dr. Retsky has said feel free to share the link.",

We avoid one and step in another one. I posted on your surgery thread and it was with misgivings. Misgivings b/c those that don't search and only follow what the doc says can be fine, they also, can end up damaged or dead. It's such a troubled time. You I think were the only one that sought out the info that we worked on in 2015. ?, do you know of any others? For those that seek info. The threads that I alerted you to, should be good for a couple of years as a basis to get someone going. Some want to research, some don't. I think you have them all linked in your topic box. I suggest, please, that you put in the topic box Dr. Vikas Sukhatme's video. He does such a great job explaining about the importance of Ketorolac/ Toradol. It comes from Dr. Retsky's publication as the primary researcher which is highlighted in my thread and a previous thread done by Falleaves. Every reason for not using it is covered in the Toradol thread, but, also, every reason to attempt to get your doc to use it is covered. Cowcakes. I say cowcakes b/c as a child running through the fields in bare feet, thinking I have great happiness, then my foot would enter something gooshy and warm. Then ewhhhhh. As a city kid visiting the farm it was a lesson :) That really is what life is like at times. Also, please, update the three threads regarding your progress. Will you continue to alert new surgery threads? If that is part of your mission, that would be great. I'm 7 years out and wearing down. Been advocating for so long, but now wanting to slide out a bit. Many blessings that all goes well.",

I think you should rename your thread \"Surgery newbies, Grandma's in and invites you to talk\" Serious. \"Pain and nausea\" doesn't do justice to what you are trying to do. All it takes is a PM to the mods. Newbies are at times confused where to post a question initially. You're very positive, uplifting, and giving attitude would be a wonderful solace for newbies.

Looking frorward to you coming back. Based on all that we know of you now, you have lead a most interesting life. Himalayas and America Indian life. You should consider a book.I know you won't be back for awhile. Protection of your neck and fatigue at the computer is a great issue. For others, what Karla and I shared is I slept in traction for 3 years in my 20's. No fun. AND lets talk about birth control measure to the extreme LOL. \"Well dear I'm going to hang up now\".   Glad for the explanation of HANTE YO. Squid-----heywhatup? TO All --do scarves. I believe I caught an infection from one of the wigs I tried on. I am still dealing with it x number of months later. It was not an issue until I went and tried on donated wigs. Then became a big issue and then periodic --bad bacteria. Now for some reason has become an issue again. It is is asscociated with flashing. I use a 10% clorox solution.  Doesen't bleach hair , but is controlling what the dermatologist couldn't. BUT IN A DO OVER I WOULD NEVER PUT ON  A WIG AGAIN. Scarves can be so much fun and exoctic and washable. But I had saved all my scarves for the 60-70's. When I went to the BC center that allowed x number of scarves and wigs. I started with one person in the room while playing with how they could be tied. Then all the staff came in and they asked where I had learned how to do these different ties. And I said --I was a flower child of the sixtes and 70's---------the 60's were different and than the 70's were different. ----------------don't put anything on your head that the can't verify that no one else hasn't. I ended up with an entrococcuss faeclias infection.  May have been self induced, But trust me ain't worth it. AND it wasn't there until I tried on there stuff. And i believe now it's like MRSA. ________________Hate to blow anyones balloon.  Karla-- to late you won't read this --but TEDS haven't been proved to show any beneficial affect either---wish I could remember the article , but can't. I was very appreciative when the article came out because could never find from young nursehood that showed anything scientifically that supported them. Then there was a report in AJN(last 2 years). Then a few months later in a medical journal that stated they could be harmful. WELLLLLLLLL that sucks doesn't it. I started in 74 trying to find out why they believed Teds were beneficial. No science behind them. Then when the science says they are in fact dangerous, I can't site chapter and verse.  AS nurses we all know Standard of Care---the problem of SOC has been it may have not been supported by science. BUT because it has been done in the past, if it hasn't been carried on, and someone gets a dvt and don't have TEDS on they have a lawsuit. It takes forever to change medical behavior. Early ambulation and foot pumps are the best prevention against dvt. Other modalities for those at risk are applicalble i.e. anticoagulants-lovenox /fragmin/ and I forget but very expensive LOL.  Bothers me I can't remember -----oh welllllllllll Standard of care------insulin sliding scale-----know one knows where it came from------A  doc I used to be able to site his name --he's from JOHNS HOPKINS--researched it. He was only able to narrow it done to the northeast. He showed how it caught on like wild fire ---with no research that supported it's use.  No scientitific evidience it worked. I think he published around 1998.  I hate memory loss. To have been a teacher, and not remember is a loss beyond a sunset.",

      "Content": "Oct 3, 2010 11:38PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:52AM by sas-schatzi PIt Pat I would say go for the port. The infection risks between each are unknown to me because I haven't done an evidence based research. But from applied experience, the complications from a PICC can be serious. DVT & infection control for two. The advent of the port in reducing damage to vascular tissue is it's greatest claim. When I asked for a port my doc denied me. Yet, my husband's doc insisted he have a port. My tx was to be for four c/t, my husbands was for six. No one could/ would /or did give me an adequate explanation why he was offered a port and I wasn't. We both had snl bx's --so, we each had only one arm for use for the rest of our lives. My first chemo, I was stuck 5x's by three chemo nurses. The final stick was below 2 of the puncture site attempts And near two others. Chemo leaked into extravascular space from three of the puncture site attempts & maybe the fourth also,  to hard to tell because they were so close. The discoloration it caused took more than a  year to disappear. I didn't have any more chemo because I had a really bad reaction. Which if you look at my post above I talked about the drug interaction.  My husband Had his 2nd recurrence chemo that had to be done in the hospital. He recieved daily tx's for four days. He  received one chemo tx through an arm vien after he indavertently pulled his iv out in the middle of the night. They reinserted a peripheral, He complained of pain at the site. His chemo nurse poohpoohed him. The next shift chemo nurse found the infiltration. The area was very dark and hard until he passed away. At least it didn't slough.Which was a real possibility.   A port put in by a competent doc , used properly, has so many saftey features. Read up about power ports. In a do over, I would have changed docs until I found one who would put in a port. Once in keep as long as you can because we would like to predict that one round of chemo will do the trick. BUT......... Just like Squid says her arm viens are shot. If you can't use the SLN bx side . Your left with the legs for labs, BP's, and anesthesia. There is the lymphedema site that discusses these problems at length.  Come to the Catholic Thread. All faiths are welcome. It's a great spiritual group.There also a an alternative treatment thread that has a meditation component. You'd have to do some sleuthing to find it. I've heard some discussion of it, but can't retrieve the memory.  What are you using in wound site Dressing care? Good luck with healing. Sheila",

Obviously, anyone who has had the metal testing done with positive reaction YAY. Improvement of symptoms post removal YAY. IMPORTANT: next step in the process is that the FDA reporting paperwork for \"Adverse Event\" Should be sent in by the provider. It's a requirement, but how compliant docs are who knows. Reporting of adverse events with drugs and medical devices is under the oversight by the FDA. Once a threshold level of reports are received by the FDA, they send out a warning and or add a warning to the paperwork related to the device or drug. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics/855809?page=1#idx_15 ",

Infection outcomes are better if an antibiotic is given one hour pre-op. Staff really tries to time it right. I linked to page ten b/c I posted about several pre-op things and then some post op things. They apply to any surgery. I noticed as I was scrolling that I talked about doing a colon prep before surgery. Most docs will have you do this and provide specific instructions. A colon prep is, particularly, important for any BELLY(abdominal- correct term) surgery. I did mention Magnesium citrate. That's one approach, if the doc doesn't give clear guidelines, but I'd do it two days before, avoids the leftover squirts, then low residue or clear liquids. A properly prepared bowel pre-op can make a world of difference post-op in comfort and pain.    Link to Port thread. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/721889?page=10 This is a thread that I worked allot on re:incision and wound care.

For Laproscopic  assisted hysterectomies, the angle of the table is only slightly at a head down angle(10-20 degrees)  or not adjusted at all. The leg position varies depending on the procedure. There  are specially designed leg mounts for laproscopic procedures. You will be on your back with legs up, but comfortably up. The shoulder pain that is experience by many has to do with a couple of things. Gas is introduce into the abdomen to effectively create a bubble. The bubble raises the abdominal wall away from the abdominal organs. That's why Laprocopic works. The abdominal wall has many muscles in it, the gas raise them away--Voila the doc has room to work :) The reduced recovery time from Laproscopic surgeries is b/c none of those muscles had to be cut. Why the shoulder pain? At the end of a laproscopic procedure, in the steps of removing the instruments a VERY kind surgeon will take an extra moment to allow the escape of the gas. Important step. ASK your doc to be so kind. He/she will look at you and ask how you know that it can help. LOL, tell them you've studied. Even in the situation of a very kind surgeon, there may be shoulder pain after surgery b/c not all the air is released. What happens then is when the patient assumes an upright position, the air in the abdomen will go up to the highest area which is under the diaphragm. On the underside of the diaphragm is the PHRENIC nerve. The phrenic nerve when irritated i.e by the gas/air in this situation, refers(sends too) the pain to the shoulder. >>>>>>It's not that the shoulder was involved in anyway except as a signal that the phrenic nerve at the diaphragm  was irritated.       :) Surely hope that was clear. Because if it was,  you understand more than even most nurses do. One of the things you can do to help the shoulder pain is to lay flat. That causes the remaining gas to redistribute underneath the belly side of the abdominal wall i.e. takes it away from the Phrenic nerve. The Phrenic nerve is less irritated and the result is pain goes away. Over time the gas absorbs into the system and is carried away. :)  Le recommendations by Binney and others are good to go recommendations. Hope my explanation of the surgical info helps. sassy",

      "Content": "Sep 25, 2015 06:40PM - edited Sep 25, 2015 10:45PM by sas-schatzi Hi Kathy, Sorry, your SIL is going through this. The info that everyone has addressed is great and you have started the process necessary to change the scenario. Just as a point in reference, what setting are you in? Home, nursing home, hospital? Not that it changes any concerns or actions, but helps in my thought regarding my response. This is written in more detail than some may think appropriate, but it can be useful to others. First Look: When you go into her room, take a look from head to toe. Stand there and look. If the patient is resting quietly breathing without effort, it's a good clue they are comfortable. That first observation is only seconds. Then to a methodical head to toe exam. Please, realize you have to apply the information to the setting you are in. So, when I say do this or that it may mean ask the nurse :) In the hospital / nursing home setting alerting staff that patient needs evaluation because your first look walking through the door tells you somethings wrong, or when you visit in those settings you know the questions to ask. In the home setting, as I was with my husband technically I was the wife not the nurse. But I have many times trained my homecare families in what I'm presenting to you. You have identified crying and head beating, but they're many more clues.. Not sure how long this will be, but here I go. Non-verbal cues to pain First Look: head to toe observation--few seconds, then proceed with taking a closer look at each body part. Once used to this process you will know how to change it as needed Head>> facial grimace, eye twitching, lip biting, repetitive head turning, arching of neck and head, nasal flaring, sounds>>grunting/crying/wimpering/ whistling/other noises, pawing, or hitting. Place your hand below the nostrils to check air flow from the nose. Nose cleaning is probably the least thought of thing in all of care. Open mouth--look at gums and tongue. Unusual redness, swelling, white coating may be Thrush. Thrush can be incredibly painful. Chest>>>breathing>>are respirations fast/slow. Is there an unusal rise and fall of the chest. Nasal flaring can apply to problems breathing or to pain. Sounds can apply to problems of breathing or pain Abdomen>>pawing at the belly, arching in any direction. This one you wouldn't likely feel comfortable doing/looking at, but it's here for completeness. With the belly exposed is their visible movement inside the abdomen. Does the belly appeared distended. Is the belly hard--all over or just in one area. (this is more in the home setting when the only caretaker is the family member). Extremities>>repetitive movement, twitching, pawing Skin:if pain is uncontrolled the body will react with a \"fright or flight\" response, skin will be cool to cold and damp/moist. Gooseflesh may even be observed. Color will be pale. Blood pressure changes: Knowing the patients usual range is the basic need to know. This can be a toughy because the origin of the pain will suggest what pressure to expect. Generally, uncontrolled pain will cause the pressure to go up( fright or flight response). But if the pain is associated with trauma, the pressure may be low b/c of bleeding. If the patient is on blood pressure meds this sign may be of limited value because the meds are blocking the fright or flight response. Heart rate: Knowing the patients usual range is the basic need to know. Generally, uncontrolled pain will cause a fast heart rate (fright or flight response) If the patient is on medicine that is blocking a fast rate change, then this sign is of limited value if it's in the accepted normal range. These above are the things to observe and access. This all can be done in 5 minutes or so. Then I would check for a bowel impaction and bladder distention. May sound nuts, but in an altered mental status the head hitting/grimacing that is easily attributable in your SIl's case to bone mets to the skull, could be b/c she's impacted. Once the first look and the vital signs>>BP/pulse/respiration has been done, assured of no impaction or bladder distention, decided whether I was going to give pain med or this is a new problem and doc needs alerting. Then I would go through all the comfort measures>>>>I will add to the bottom of this an old post that addresses what to do with a verbal patient. The approach is a bit different and they're aren't any absolutes. With a nonverbal patient, I'd get the pain med on board and let it start working it's magic before I did the comfort measures Or had the aide(family member if home setting) start the comfort measures while I got the pain med. Bestbird had a great list of comfort measures, so, I won't repeat them here. I think the key is once the decision is made to give pain medicine don't delay getting it on board.",

Probably could still use some tweaking, but it's been a long day. Jun 21, 2011 01:22 am sas-schatzi wrote: This is going to be long, sorry folks. Generic description of how to evaluate pain and what to do. Try to see if comfort measures will change level of pain. If you have been in one position too long that can cause muscle fatigue which can lead to pain. When appropriate try warming up, mild stretching, or getting up and walk around. In the hospital, after asking what when where why , how long etc to determined what I was dealing with, I'd look to see if something to tight/ restricting etc. If the patient has pushed things too much, too fast pain could be from over use---rest. Bottom line is figure out what we are dealing with first. Using the pain scale. Research has shown that the worst judges of a patients pain are doctors and nurses. The best judge of the patient pain is there own self description. Everyones tolerance of pain and response to pain is different. I know allot of people mock the pain scale, but with adequate explanation it works. The visual smiley frown face scale was developed for children. It accuracy has been proven by research. With adults the visual scale has been proven to be inaccurate. The numerical scale is the method of choice that is more accurate in adults. Zero --no pain. 1-3 is mild pain, generally tolerated well. There are people that would like relief from this level of pain. Tylenol or NSAIDS like motrin, advil, if tolerated usually work well. 4- 6 is moderate pain. The choice of pain reliever can be individual here too. Many people do not like taking a narcotic because of fear of getting hooked. So using the previously mentioned drugs are okay. Some people don't get relief with these drugs, taking the lowest dose narcotic may be a better choice for this individual. Many of the narcotics are combined with the NSAIDS or tylenol. For example, Tylenol 325 mg with oxycodone 5mg = percocet, tylenol 500 mg + oyxcodone = Tylox, Hydrocone and tylenol 325mg =Vicodin/Norco etc. Generally, pain prescriptions are written , for example, \"Take one to two tabs as necessary for pain every 4-6 hours\". I suggest try one pill at lowest dose. If relief is not acceptable, and the doc has said it's okay take the second one---do so. 7-10 is severe pain, if at home this is the range that taking the higher allowed dose versus one is a consideration. Generally, you should expect pain level to decrease below at least a four. If no pain relief or relief is unacceptable, this is the time to call your doc. Please, don't exceed recommend doses without doctor being aware because it could be an indicator something serious is brewing. NSAIDS and tylenol are not benign drugs. Taken in doses higher than recommended can cause damage to the liver and the kidney, that may not be reversible. NSAIDS and tylenol should never be taken with alcohol. Damage to the liver and kidney can be caused by mixing these drugs and alcohol. In summary, tyr comfort measures i.e position change, massage, adequate sleep, adequate hydration. Lack of proper hydration will cause the muscles to ache/pain and fatigue faster. Use pain medicine either non-narcotic or narcotic based on pain level. If they're is no response to pain reliever or pain relief isn't acceptable call your doctor. Edit: Recently have become aware of narcotic affect on immunity in cancer patients. Just mention it as an FYI to discuss with your doc.",

I agree LE's  NOT on their radar. When I had my craniotomy in 2012. They wanted to use the SLN(left) side. I refused consent with the explanation of concern about LE. The anesthesia doc stated there was \"Only a 3 % risk\". I said \"I absolutely refuse to give consent for the left arm to be used for anything\" I think I even wrote it on the anesthesia consent form. I woke up with an arterial line in the left wrist. Ended up with no complication, but I was not happy. I used to teach the elements of a proper consent. I read the anesthesia record, it stated that two attempts were made at the right wrist before it was inserted in the left. There was NO evidence of a puncture site at the right wrist. Very upset at that. What could I have done to protect my self, anything more? At least I/we can store away for future reference if there's away to make it ironclad that a SLN/ LND not be used.",

I always thought in terms that why have something that can make trouble later on--get it out. Now I would like to know long term risk facts. I'm curious to see what Binney has to say. I may try to find something on the internet. Is there a syndrome for \"Shaken Computer\"? On my being stuck on the SLN side. There was an at length discussion in the preop area. They said they were going to do it. That's why I said so strongly that they couldn't. Knowing how strongly I felt and that I was signing the consent, it would be totally with in character for me to have written it as an absolute exclusion on the consent. I never retrieved the consent from Medical Records. I would have if LE had occurred, you can bet your sweet  bippy, I woulda. Post-op in ICU when I had my wits about me. I questioned them hard. I examined the right wrist area, where the arterial line would have been attempted. The arterial line needle is a horse needle compared to a standard IV line. There would have been a mark for several days. Two attempts, two holes.  Nada. I hate to say they faked the report to be able to justify using the left side. That, oh so, goes against all I know and believe. But the facts are as stated. No marks and record says two attempts. Examined by me around 6 hours after surgery ended and in ICU. I haven't written about this on BCO before. BUT your concern, is/was my concern. I thought I had it all covered, to prevent use. DS present, Anesthiologist, CRNA, and CRNA trainee, Anesthesia resident(5 total).......it was a big debate. I even, was egotistical enough that I thought it was a great learning experience for the resident and CRNA trainee. It was the reverse. That's part of why I'm very interested to know if Binney has an opinion about this.",

Retrospectively, I describe my career as the longest residency ever--40 years.  Nurses aide med surg> nursing school. Worked all through school (floated as an aide-requested postpartum and nursery b/c they didn't wear me out for studying>cardiology>operating room>teaching EMS-Emt A-'s/Paramedics, disaster stuff> ER>Med/Surg float for ten years while doing the EMS trick> house float to any where - radiology too.  Then a surgery center besides pre-op/OR/ recovery/post-op, they, also, included pain mgt, GI, Bronchs, bone marrow bx's, and snakes under one roof and huge spiders. Must say I didn't like the snakes and spiders> then back to Surg with floating to Med. Enough ICU floating from the floor that they didn't groan>homecare '89-'92 then the last year '08-'09.  Used to joke,  I could take a patient from home to hospital to home and go to every department. This could sound like a boast. But the serious side is, I do know what is expected at each level AND what can go wrong. That knowledge can only be gained through doing, seeing, and accumulating. Circumstance allowed me the exposure. Must add,  curiousity and a willingness to learn new things.  Oncology considered it in 2001. It's such a  subspecialty of nursing that takes intense study. I chose the mentor I wanted to teach me. As fate would have it, she developed BC. I saw no one else as diligent or knowledgeable for my mentor. Oncology for me, was left on the shelf. The positive, I ran into her the other day at the cancer center. She's 13 years post dx. Her+. Long ago, she mets'd once to the liver. Then another time, mets'd to the liver and lung. With each mets, I thought we were saying our goodbyes. Remission with each was accomplished, however her docs did it. She gets Herceptin shots once a week. 13 years and she's still working full time. She's legendary in our locale. :)",

      "Content": "Sep 15, 2014 08:12PM - edited Sep 15, 2014 08:17PM by sas-schatzi Binney... OR, the education there is like no other, but my OR experience was in a teaching hospital. The teamwork is like no other area that I worked in. The standards weren't like any other area. SOOOOOOOOoo high. I've often said that if we could develop an apprenticeship program- take a brand new nurse and  put them on a med- surg floor for 1 year, then send them to the OR for minimum 2 years, then ICU or ER for 1 to 2years,  then the opposite. Then back to the floor. We could reduce so many problems. Complications galore. Infection. Cardiovasculopulmonary problems. Mortality and morbidty would go way down. Plus, by the end of the apprenticeship in most institutions the nurse would be vested, they have a reason to stay. A highly skilled person at the bedside. The future demands a really skilled person at the bedside. The past did too, but even now the least skilled in breadth of knowledge are being asked to care for more ever complex patients in standard hospital beds. It's rare that an OR nurse comes out of the OR. Why b/c of autonomy. The nurse runs the OR room that they are assigned to that day. They tell the docs what to do. It's not a power struggle. Yes, there is the schedule, but in the room the circulator runs the room. The responsibility is awesome. Safety paramount. Vigilence(sic) to the max. Coordination of the patient, anesthesia, room setup>> It's a cotillion for each case. It all goes beautifully with a well trained nurse. Let that nurse not understand, or recognize, and respond to trouble..... disaster can ensue. Plus, the nurse has to be able to scrub. These days it's a separate training program for non RN's. But the nurse that can scrub and circle, brings the best to the control and function of the patients surgery. Troubleshooting the problems is the key, that can lead to better outcomes. Being able to troubleshoot problems comes from knowing everything that's going on directly at the table. The standard of care of understanding what is sterile, clean but contaminated(i.e.not touched by blood or body fluids, but I touched it with my hand and it can't be used), contaminated, hazardous contaminated(gas gangrene)which needs special handling. Would lead to better infection control outside of the operating room. How often my standard of care conflicted with usual floor(outside the OR) standard of care----I was considered by some wonderful and others a PITA. The skills of the OR are so much higher than the rest of the world. Other specialties may or may not meet the standard. That's bitchy LOL. But I worked all the areas. The standard I functioned by was the precepts of the OR. Except when we had Lab storage problem that was going to be moved and exploded by the fire department. Then the EMS/Disaster training kicked in for relocation of patients. The same lovely young charge nurse that day of the planned explosion who was so relieved that I took over direction, was the same lovely that said after a cardiac arrest that I had to run b/c the doc \"hit the wall\". \"Oh you were here, I knew we didn't have to worry\". Well that was a lovely thought. But behind it was all the varied training. With training, we all can do stuff. Staying in one job for a lifetime has value to a degree, but does have limits. Sorry glennie this is off the topic......But it was fun. THANKS,  Binney for the question. At my age and being retired, being asked for an opinion is nice. OH, hugs sassy",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2012 02:34AM - edited Apr 4, 2012 02:39AM by sas-schatzi Laura, I'm so sorry that you have reached this stage. We may have our numbers from 1-4, but life has a way of making those numbers irrelevant. You have taken the responsibility of guiding the family. From what you have written, you have done an excellent job. A painful one, but it sounds as if everyone has turned to you as their guide and communicator. This lays a heavy burden on anyone in this role. While I'm not stage 4, I have been the guide for many. I understand your pain and fear of making the right decision.  Your words\" I 'm not sure why it's hitting me so hard! I mean is this really it... is mom going to leave soon... what about all you ladies who have lived more than 1 year with this thing... why cant i find that strength right now... how can i find it. I am the one that needs to be strong for my mom and dad... i cant stand feeling the way i do right now.\"  MY hope for you is that you have a belief in a God and that prayer is part of your belief system. It can be so much help with all that you are going through. Their are many that successfully transition these feelings without or with a different belief system. My point is not to debate these types of religious thoughts. But when you , under such a burden of thoughts ,can bring to your being , a source of help and feelings of guidance, the solace shall help you in ways yet unknown to you. You are conflicted because of fear of making the wrong decision and thus guiding your family to a wrong decision. If prayer is part of your life, this is the time to pray. Seek guidance from an experienced grief counselor that will listen to your concerns and ask you the right questions.They will help identify the \"why\" of what you are feeling. Once those questions are clarified for you---- and each of these questions and answers are different in ways that we don't realize until we can get them out of our minds by talking. It's as if taking a tumbled puzzle and putting the pieces in the right place.  Their comes a time that each of us will face this.  Being prepared for the answers are , so, very hard. Knowing what it is your MOM wants is primary. Knowing what your DAD feels is very important, but he needs guidance too. It sounds, as if they have given over to you the decisions because they aren't ready to deal with the answers. Hence, you feel the burden of guiding them. First, you need a guide as I have said above. Once your thoughts are clear, you will be able to better able to not feel paralysed in this situation. Fear of the right words to use, is a serious part of your conflict right now. Below the surface, there is a sense of guilt that we all feel , \"Am I doing the right thing\". Prayer and giving it up to God, can help.  I have had a BMX, I'm one week out from a craniotomy that did show my brain tumor to be non-malignant. One week earlier, I did give it up to God and accept that I could not change what may be for me.  The sense of peace was immense. It's not that I was giving up the \"fight\", but that I was prepared that if the words that might be said to me , were not what I wanted to hear, I could deal with what the future held for me. I recently, lost my DH. We had cancer at the same time. The decisions you are going through , I too had to be his guide. It wasn't and still isn't easy. I grieve him everyday. I do know for myself that my belief in God has been what helped me get through all the decisions. I turn to God daily and nightly. I feel enveloped in his love for me and my dear sweet lover of 38 years. However, you choose to work towards going forward, I pray for your spirit to be less burdened. May all that I have said in someway, helps in a way that warms you and brings you no distress.  Blessings sheila",

Whereas, when I haven't I lived to regret it. In 2008, after several years of thinking about having an elective bmx because of family history strong for BC, I had a gut feeling, now was the time to do it. I started through the process. 1st step was a mammo, it was clean with the letter rec'd that said the typical NED see you in one year. But I was on a quest to have them off. The next step in the process was an MRI. It was done 4 months later. BINGO there it was, and I got the phone call that said highly suspicious. At bx-- grade 2( enough sample and no pathology error)left breast. BMX 3 weeks later it had increased to a grade 3. Node negative. Obviously, it was highly agressive. Had I not followed my gut , that said \" these babies needed to go\" and kept working the process to get them off,  I might not be writing this today. My identical twin had BC in 96. When I found out she was ER+. I said \"We had work to do\". We both had total hysters and BSO In 96. So, what caused me after thinking about it from 96 to 08, to act in 08. My gut feeling.  I have kept that --All clear NED--- letter and periodically read it over the last 23 months. I'm in awe each time I read it. And enjoying being alive.",

I have two stories: one of nursing, and one of religious belief. I have been in nursing since 1969 (RN since 1974), and never have I seen someome go through the pain that Greg went through on thursday. The hospice team worked so hard to control his pain. There were so many phone calls and so many changes of mediactions.  I am guessing that the tumors in the retroperitoneal space were growing likes spirals with cabagge tendirils. Pushing on the bladder making him think he had to pee every 3-10 minutes. It was confirmed later in the day by the hospice doc who went back to the hospital and reexamined all of the data. They worked so hard. They had uped his morhine to 40 mgc/hr-pyridium to reduce the bladder spasms, but it seemed to have little affect.  While we were waiting for the next set of prescriptions to be picked up by my son, I said \"well what have I got in my aresenal\" - On hand and ordered - I gave him a restoril 30 mg. His last words were \"Sheila, I'm not going to make it.\"  He went into a peaceful sleep five minutes later. He hadn't slept that soundly in 20 years. He made the usual noises of a sleep apneic, but more restful. Only someone who has slept by an apneic patient could comprhrend that statement. He slept that way for about 6 hours.  Then he began agonal breathing - the type of breathing that can last for a few minutes or for days. Thankfully, he only did it for about 15 minutes When he went into the peaceful sleep,   I went on the  porch and prayed for a quick passing, and called is aquatics GF's to spread the word for a quick passing. I coulnd't see my Greg go through so much pain again if he awoke.  Thankfully he did not .  The hospices nurses had only seen a patient suffer this much one other time. I was thankfull they reacted so clearly to the situation.  My Greg is gone. My heart is broken. God has taken him home Throughout all his pain he neveronce swore. The one time that he happened to brush against  one of the girls legs, he quickly apologized. He even remembered to say \"excuse me\" whenever he could not help control belches. Me, I would have been swearing all over the place. One of the reasons I married him was because he was such a gentleman--- a gentleman  to the end.",

      "Content": "Oct 3, 2010 12:10AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:51AM by sas-schatzi NO no NO     WE ALL LEARNED FROM ---My Big Fat Greek Wedding ---the answer to all  problems is WINDEX--YES? On of my catashorphies last year was, I got an enterococcuss faecalis infection of rhe scalp __yugh. After studying it , I would have preferred MRSA. After 5 weeks of dermatologist treatment , I did my own research. I found an article from the pedatrics journal Apr 09. They used bleach in a tub bath, < 1 cup,  for kids with serious secondary infections caused by scratching because of primary psoriasis.. Long story short, I remembered about reading how a 10% solution is required in restaurants to wipe tables. OSHA doesn't require personnel to where gloves for protection. So, I made a 10% solution --used am/pm first day, am for next 2 days, then was recultured that after noon. Warned by derm. that there would likely be staph because it's a normal flora of the scalp skin. Results ---no e faecalis , no staph, nada. Cured. I did notice I had to continue maybe once a month for awhile. Symptoms were related to flashing. I  am flashing now because I am weaning off my pain med. So, head is wet at night. Don't know if it is in a chronic state, but my 10% solution is the only thing controlling it. But original site is painful. Infection started after using minixodil. I should have had the bottle tested , but didn't. I'm still on pain med because my docs at the time did not believe the pain I was in, was related to Arimidex. I found out in mid to late Feb through the drug checker GENELEX  that  I had been overdosed on cytoxan/taxotere, arimidex and Femara because of an adverse drug interaction with Norvasc. Those overdoses put me into a chronic wide spread pain cycle CWP-fibromyalgia. ALso, caused major damage to patellas and acetabular ring cysts.Now I'm trying to get off the pain meds to see what is underneath........Just my usual old post polio pain or  what? Lived with postpolio my whole life.  But what those drugs did last year took me too a pain level that was 100 on a ten scale. ALL because my docs and pharmacists didn't do a drug interaction run that they had available to them. Post polio patients for unknown reasons feel pain more acutely than the average person, and react to  all medication differently than the NORMAL persons.  Anesthesia can be particularly dangerous and all recommended sources on PP recommend an overnight stay because of potential complications. Handing articles to my docs never did any good because 99.9% had no direct care or knowledge of polio. Add to that the overdoses. OH well thats fucked.  For example, drug interaction checker stated that Arimidex/Femara ENHANCED by 25-75 % by Norvasc. We as nurses know what that translation is------OVERDOSE.  I was PISSED. I trusted in their care, and I was damaged. CF. So, I have had to be on Savella -classification SNRI  approved in 09 for fibromyalgia, and a pain reliever Fentanyl---which the drug checker pointed out is a Prseroternergic drug---Duh it enhances SNRI and SSRI's, ergo is a danger to anyone on those drugs if that is an unknown.. Previous to this, pain ranged from 3-7. Rarely went higher. Worst after 13-15 hr shifts. Then a 10 or more.. When I asked for someone to take me to my car in a wheelchair, they all knew it was bad. They could tell by the way I was walking or not walking  by the end of a shift. The joke on the unit was \"I feel like Sheila\".  WEll rarely did I take any pain med. I accepted this was a life long situation and \"just deal with it\" ANYOne on aromasin   It can be enhanced by norvasc by 150%.  ASked to be genetically tested to see if tamoxifen would work---Onc has never put in request to insurance even though he has it in 2 sets of notes that it was requested. The insurance company verified no such request made since January. He is being fired this week.  When I first brought up the genetic testing re:Greg---His ONC's jawed dropped and eyes widened and said \"I don't even know that stuff... In one of Greg's last visits one of the nurses was relating how they were going to have to start genetically testing to make sure the drugs the were giving would work. WELL I know they are doing it because of my questioning. the big boss_my ONC doesn't like to behind anything. It will help others , but i feel like we were left in Sherwood forrest. What will be tested is metabolic pathways in the liver that have to do with cytochrome P450. The paths that can be tested are 2d6,2c9,2c19, ANd 3 more. The most troublesome one doesn't have a test yet. It is 3A4.  Genelex is a great teaching site. It has a 30 day free trial. You can learn alot. Use the teaching video. I didn't at first. It was amazing how much easier it was after watching the video--LOL. Karla----The search term you might want to study is SURGICAL STRESS RESPONSE. Short story--whomever maybe you said surgical trauma was right --body believes it is being attacked. Sends out messages from the whole pituitary/hypothalamus/midbrain/medulla to stimulate the sympathetic system which causes the FRIGHT/FLIGHT response. All the chemicals produced in that situation are produced during surgery. Hence the retention of fluids. It's only after the body no longer preceives danger that diuresis occurs. Only know this because of toxemia during pregnancy. Same mechanism. 25 years ago it was a hard search, now a few seconds. It's a big reason why anesthiologist load patients up with fluids, they are trying to trick the kidney into not responding to all the chemicals telling it to retain fluids. Too often you just end up looking like a puff ball, then end up days of peeing like a racehorse. I believe thats a mixed metaphor, again LOL , unless it's you sitting on the peepot. Personaly, after my body decided it was okay after toxemia , I lost 37 lbs in 10 days. Ring around the butt. Squid I will go to CT and find your note. Wish we were in Vegas. Maybe we all should decide to go meet someplace like The Ta Ta's are doing this week. I can tell you I spent a lifetime of being careful and frugal(cheap). Don't  feel that's the way to go(literaly) now. The cruise last week was very good. Came home to play Scarlett again. Frigging tired of the bleeping paperwork. Flying can be dangerous if you want to avoid lyphedema. So, where do we travel too without getting on a plane? ?????? L&H&N SAS",

It can permanently interrupt healing. Found this out when Greg's had to be delayed because of a spider bite in Jan. His time was quite long 5 weeks, but I trusted the surgeon--he was the only one with which there was no foul up. He excised about a golf ball size abcess. Similarly when he put his port in in Apr, he said it could be used the same day. I'm guessing it was the difference between a clean and dirtyenvenomated wound? I would just ask the surgeon their recommendation. I'm guessing you won't let the nurse that didn't have a clue about sterile dressing changes near you again. Squid I feel your same feelings, I brought my DDad to Akron, to the hospital I worked at. In 7 months there were 5 hospital admissions, all had big screw ups which I caught except the last one. They put him on dialysis 2 days in a row , They didn't do Sat. dialysis. He died on dialysis--no suction in the room, no crash cart, nurse not acls certified, no oxygen, in a part of the building that was underconstruction---so the code team was late finding the room. His autopsy showed he had a blocked trachea. Did I say no suction. I was the first to the room and than the team got there with the cart, then my boss who was a board certified Er doc and ACLS instuctor trainer. I told him to get in there before they killed him__new residents___I'm outside the room and I hear him keep saying \"some one check the airway and suction\" over and over. I never tried to prove it, but I don't believe that Crash cart suctions, have the power that wall suction has.   The irony is my whole day was spent teaching Mega code to my paramedic students. The paramedics could run rings around the residents because of what we demanded in practice. I agree it took along time to work through those feelings.  Then I compare what happened to Greg and me. Then I listen to all the stories here and on the other threads. WTF how do we make it through any of it. Each of us aren't perfect, but some of the egregious errors I have seen and been told about I know I have never been part of. We could go one for hours telling stories. How is this happening. I advise anyone going in for surgery to have someone stay the night. With Greg I didn't for the first few because his mind was solid, but when it started to changed someone camped in. Steve even learned to recognize the errors and he has no medical background.  The last error we talked about tonight was the resp. tech trying to do a radial stick on the arm that had a limb alert bracelet. She was moving it out of the way. DUH complete breach of hospital policy. I stopped her . But her response was snippy and she said if she couldn't get it from the other arm SHE WOULD take from the snl arm. I said like hell you will. Went to the CEO with that one. 6 weeks no response. Steve's remark tonite was he could see the pain on his dads face. Don't know if her technique was intentional or just bad. Radial sticks aren't comfortable, but........ I hope when I go, I just fall asleep one nite and don't wake up in the morning. Then I won't have anything to complain about. Squid I hope you have been able to let go of some of the anger. I'll keep that in my prayers. I've kind of taken the attitude that God wanted Greg home, and trying to fix things kept him from going. I suppose it's a rationalization, but otherwise it's to painful. It's not happening fast. I still am in the bed retreat phase. But the Catholic thread and church are helping tremendously. Again your work there is tremendous. I'm not sure you even realize you are the glue for it. Since you have come on board it has blossomed like a cherry tree in spring. :) Namaste Sheila",

They best advise I can give you is demand in writing how much you agree to be filled with at final exchange. My doc from day one knew that I didn't want big foobs because I had implants in 1980 that had been to big. I didn't want that for the rest of my life . I thought I was getting 500 -600 maybe . He did 850. There heavy and they're work, to keep casules from forming. I said at one point, in a do over, that if he put more in the final fill at exchange, that i would get to put the disputed amount in his testicles. Try to leave at least close to 10 days between fills.  Two weeks even better. Less painful by far.  Did they leave a flap under your arm for the nipple recon? Can lead to sleep disruption if your a side sleeper. Be aware so you can work out alternative ways of sleeping.  So sorry on the miss. Namaste Sheila It's 6 am must sleep. ",

The circulating nurse in the operating room along with the physician has the primary responsibility for positioning. Ultimately, it's truly the doc's, but in a case of injury be assured the doc is going to displace or attempt to displace responsibility. Create a diary, Record by date. Record all before today under today's date. It's a matter of legal record. From this date forward record daily. Pain level and how it's affected your life. You may never use this record, but it will be your best tool to a settlement if that's where it goes. None of like to think suit. But an injury that could have been avoided, is an injury. The doc's accept responsibility of your care. They are schooled in care. If negligence occurred and care wasn't right. Then we do what we have too. I will link to Pain and Other things. The first page has much on pain and recording. Thanks for posting your experience on the PORT thread. I will cut and paste this response back there too. It will take a number of minutes to bring the other link back. YES, a diary is the biggest PITA, but it can make a difference Hugs, sassy https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/136/topics/839123?page=1 ",

I was dx' with firbro caused by Arimidex then femara refused further tx ---then changed onc's . he was so strong about me being on something(oncotype dx score30) I went on Aromasin---------the drug that has no s.e's--------well mininmal at first then started the same pattern of arimidex except i don't have long bone pain. Sledgehammarer for both hit in the fifth month. New developing nodules on phalanges.  All joint pain---- went back on Fentanyl 25 mcg last week. Have been on Savella 25 mg bid since arimidex fiasco dec 09. .Post Polio all my life ------original infection 1952 as a 2 y/o. Post polio syndrome kicked in in the 70's and took off in the 80's. -------------Difference with PPs is I could tolerate it without drugs.  Now ---not with the Aromasin. But I use one Fentanyl patch a week vs changing every 72 hrs. Fentanyl has serotonergic effect like the ssri's and ssnri's, but has the pain relieving effect that they don't. Problem is if you aren't real carefull with it , it can be highly addicting. That's why I change it only once a week. Everyone would tell you it can't be done this way. It can. I went through it when I was on it before. Didn't want to go back on it again . If I think I have to do it more than once a week -------it will not happen. I'm also , on Savella 25 mg bid.could go to 50 mg bid , but am afraid to do it.  So, I get the antifibro effect from savella and fentanyl ,the pain relief from fentanyl and am able to tolerate the Aromasin. AND am able to function. OXYcodone is not an answer. Nsaids for me causes Blood pressure problems. I saw someone earlier mention Savella. That's why I went back several pages. Savella was approved herein the USA in Late 08 Or early 09. It was avaialable in Europe for 10 years. FDA gave them proprietary rights vs genaric----------duh ----money.  Typical to our government---------suck the money out of us. OF course all the drugs , I'm taking have an insomnia s.e. ............. DUH it's 3:50 am I'll close now simply b/c long reads are work. -------------sheila",

Hospice tried, like no team, I have ever worked with to control the situation . There wasn't an hour that went by that they weren't on the phone trying to figuire out something to fix the situation. . BUT God was there. , he finally rested and then he passed peacefully. I thank you all for your prayers and support. As far as the hospital errors , I went right to CEO. WIth the cancer center I will follow up after the funeral.  Cathy----hang in there ---we have all been through the emotions you are going through now. Please consider going to the Catholic thread. They welcome all faiths and there prayers are all embracing of any faith.  BCO(breastcancer.org) has so much to offer for whatever your need is--to learn review the main pages, to talk we are all here. There are many threads. Going to _Just dx'd there are several topic threads that will help you get started . This is a journey none of us wanted to go on , but you have come to the right place . You WILL get alot of support here.You can seek advice , you can scream, you can rant, you can cry, you can do whatever it is you need to do here. We all understand because we have been where you are right now. You will get support here that you will get no place else, simply because they don't get what you are feeling right now . We are here for you. If you find a particular memeber that you feel can help you , you can do a PM --Private message. I didn't read all the instructional stuff way back when and it was not good. I missed many months of good support, because I didn't understand the dynamics of the BCO.  You have come to the nurses thread and there are many nurses here that have knowledge that can help you through the coming times. BUT wander through some of the other threads. It's what we call  lurking --where you just view what has been written but don't post anything. THAT is just fine. Go through the index and find what fits your need and add them as FAVORITES--you look at the top of any post and click on it and it will add it to your personal list. --you can delete at anytime also.  Check out the newbies pinned site for abbreviations and lingo. You will find such great support here . One of the beautiful nurses Karla,  starts every posting with \"Namaste\"  I could tell you her story, but I suggest you go back until you find it. It's not that many pages back. You will then understand why so many of us have incorporated \"Namaste\" into our writing. Namaste Sheila",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2010 02:57PM - edited Jul 11, 2010 02:59PM by sas-schatzi Hi all, new poster old nurse LOL. Squid--Thanks for getting me here. It was a very hard place to find. Nice to see you Native Mariner , FEELS LIKE HOME ALREADY --YEAH. A universal truity about nursing, Nursing mgt and  Institutions of Care is --they don't understand that the state and federal laws apply to them.  I guess there like the federal government that is exempted by the Constitution of the USA from the laws that apply to the citizens. Squid --We were going to have a pain discussion on PM ,but here is good. Native mariner is definitely on mark. I love her comment re: not leaving the room until the \"Whatever\" is managed. There was another poster on another thread that was told her pathology slides were missing and to go home and wait. She stated she would sit in the pathologist office until they were found---they were found in short order, but she wonders what the difference of two weeks meant to her when the subsequent written report was positive. I couldn't post back. For me, I went from grade 2 (adequate specimen -no error) to a grade3 in three weeks at bmx with immediate recon, but thats another story Squid----some thoughts on pain mgt. From researching my pain the new big daddy syndrome term is chronic widespread pain--CWP. It encompasses all of fibromyalgia and more, it's been awhile since search and short term memory sucks. Suggest that would be a good google.  We never got around to whether or not you are on aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen. AI's can be involved with widespread muscle, joint and bone pain, necrosis, carpal tunnel, bursitis of any joint, fibromyalgia, arthritis to the point of needing hip and knee joint replacement. I haven't studied Tamoxifen other than superficially.  You have the special problem of dealing with an old injury of the pudenal nerve. Working in a multiuse center --one of the sections was pain mgt. Pudenal nerve blocks were rare, but were done. The discussion between doc and patient that I remember was that it took a really skilled person to do them with success, could be an area to search. In Jan while doing a drug search for DH, I found GENEMDRX. When you go to this site it has a thirty day free trial and training video. I bypassed training video at first--don't. Why is it worth it? After plugging in all my drugs, I found the program identified multple drug interactions not identified on other sites. Arimidex effect was enhanced by 25-75% because of Norvasc--duh I had been  overdosed. Played with adding and deleting as I had learned from the training video. Cytoxan had been \"enhanced\" for same reason-- norvasc. Coulds have been the reason first and only chemo almost killed me . I was overdosed or enhanced by an ADR. WE will never know. I plugged in Femara same results as Arimidex. Aromasin would be enhanced by 150%. I was on a washout of Arimidex for 8 weeks and had been on Femara for several weeks and had just made the decision to stop it. Found DH had many drug interactions. This site has extensive description of cytochrome450 and all identified pathways--1A2&3,2c9,2c19,2d6,3a4 etc. I suggest it as one tool to use. I describe DRUGS.com as kindergarten and GENEMDRX as graduate school. Be cautious when printing --it will use a lot of paper and ink. Follow directions for color if you do print because the color coding is important as you will see when your there. RED for major,  2 Yellows, Green for normal. They have an email function even in the free trial mode ---send a copy to yourself and other docs. When 2 onc's mine and my husband, 1 cardiologist were presented with results and request for testing, the response was the same--\"-I don't feel comfortable ordering tests about something I don't know\". Tried to involved the research pharmacy division of my company which employs 5000--owns 3 hospitals/hospice/drs/homehealth/insurance/dme etc.  The Doctor of Pharmacy as well was having trouble keeping up, after what I had learned in the journey to understand liver pathways. That is pathetic. SO, for your self protection please, review site.  A yearly subscription for individual<25.00. At least after analyzing your profile, you may know if there is any drug manipulation you can persue. After 5 months off AI's my musculoskeletal issues are improving. With an oncotype dx score of 30, and  family extensive bc history of which  21 women-- 9-had bc--one is my twin--3  with other  types of ca, you know that decision was not easy.  The men--24 male cousins only one with prostate ca. There's a study in that one too --no ones interested. Now I'm in process of weaning off drugs that helped with the problems caused by other drugs.There is an irony in there.  I am not suggesting that anyone quit there AI's or tamox or whatever. It became a quality of life issue for me. My pain scale was100 on the usual 0-10 scale. I have high pain tolerance with a history of post polio my whole life. I suppose this is a good analogy '\"I was crippled once, I choose not to go there again\". What is unknown is ---would I have tolerated the drug if it was in therapeutic range. For the moment, I will sign off  with two original statements or I think they are--LOL SERIOUSLY SEEKING NORMAL PROACTIVE IS BEING SELFPROTECTIVE",

Chemo x1 failed to tolerate in april 09. Found out by own research inablity to tolerate chemo was likely a drug interaction with Norvasc. Similar interaction with arimidex. May have already written this, but memory is an issue. Started as a nursing aide in 69. Became a nurse in 74. Loved it, But can't nurse any longer because of the memory issue. Arimidex was enhanced by 25-75% , because of Norvasc.  Femara same thing. System wide problems that I am still recovering from. Did write a short note some pages ago after Squidwitch42 got me here. Hope to try and make it here more often and get to know you all. We have our special nurse language that has to often be explained so much on other threads. I probably should have checked ,before I started to write this because it's starting to sound pretty familar LOL. Yup been here congratted Hante yo-Karla about the new job-----hope it's going well So karla do you get to orient yourself LOL Rita D- sounds like you hit the jack pot with the 2nd doc . How did you get a 2nd consultation so fast?? Leanna and gunner I'll play devils advocate. Your attached to your ovaries at this point for what reason?.  Yes every one of us makes choices for different reasons.  Gunner you are not quite a month out from surgery if I read correctly, do not discount what anesthesia can do to your decision making ablities. You stated \"what should I do\". I agree with Native Mariner, that you are conflicted. One action Put it on paper ---- Do a pro/con list, with help of a friend, who will help keep you focused on getting your head to decide what column you want to put your answer on. Brainstorm questions \"what can my ovaries do for me now\"? \"What will give me greater piece of mind?. What does the sceince say? Will keeping my ovaries improve or relieve my pmdd? Am I going to have more children?  Will  having ovaries reduce my estrogen? Does the age of 50 significantly impact having ovaries out? Is that important in breast cancer to reduce estrogen? Do I have a choice about Tam?  Do i have a choice about AI\"s?  Pro(important to keep,or yes) side of list is longer--wait. Con(important to get rid of, or no)  side is longer --get rid of them. I've always believed pro/ con list can get you off the fence about anything. But you have to approach them with brutal honesty --Maybe isn't a consideration. If your going to use a friend to help with your list, her function is to say \"what is your MIND/Gut telling you?\" I would usually say do this on your own, but you still have the effects of anesthesia that is causing you to waffle. The friend is there to keep you from wandering off topic because of post anesthesia effects.You don't want to choose someone that will direct your answers. Again their function is to keep you on topic and focused. Rereading this I've actually said the same thing at least three times.  On topic and focused. Make a master question list. xerox for future reference. You may want to publish it. Good pro/conning sas",

They do CT's that aren't as sensitive to movement . Guess It was one of those things that never crossed my radar, until I had to have one. I wanted the MRI to avoid the radiation, and that's when the gave me the explanation. You've got the low D that went from 4 to 16, but what was the dose of the D and over what period of time? What was your bone density with the DEXA scan? I have had ostopenia/porosis dx with dexa scan a number of years back. Now it says only osteopenia very mild. When density levels were lower the Bone pain,  hurt for me like a deep gnawing type pain. It was definitely increased pain levels with 12-14 hour shifts. SometimesI had to be taken to my car in a wheelchair. Can you imagine, seeing your nurse going out in a w/c. D levels corrected before my only chemo and dexa scan had improved as above. I thought i'd be golden for neulasta  shot. But the pain during the week after neulasta, was as if wolves were gnawing and chewing on my bones and teaching the pups how to get every last bit of flesh off the bones. When I used this as an example for the nurses taking care of me. They just looked blank. I figuired how much more descriptive could I get.  Squid what do you mean by b/h pain, headaches and nausea are just your interpretation of the chemo? ((H))))sas",

Amitted following tues with wbc count of 1.5 and neut .5, temp 104.8 , pain off the charts, unable to eat. They then put me in acute renal failure by hanging the wrong IV fluids and hyponatremia of 127--Hung 1/2 Ns instead of NS. They used dilaudid IV, but the pain was only controled with me being knocked out. The nurses didn't do I &O. I told them second day I had all the symptoms of overflow urine. dribbling down side of bottom,small amounts, urgency, frequency ---third day they fnally cathed me for 900cc. Had cath for 5 days. All tests done for identifing any infection were negative. IV antibiotics started at admission led me to the path of yeast and skin problems that took 2 months and 1 week to clear up. 1 week before next surgery The acute renal failure/and hyponatremia  had been corrected by the nephrologist when he saw what fluids were being run.   Found out on my own 9 months later, I had an  ADR with norvasc and cytoxan. But at the time no one could /would figuire out why I reacted so strongly to the first chemo.   I chose at the time to dc rather than risk all my body systems .

In Ohio the industry, I respected the most for their rules on care of their workers was TYCO . Tiny tykes toyes.

I did think at the time the wolf description would get a profound response. Because you can almost feel it when you hear it. It didn't.  Am I reading that you also had that level of pain with neulasta? Have faith in getting your D to a normal level and a change in your bone pain. I credit the deep gnawing pain I had for years in the hip and femurs really got better when my D levels moved into the normal range.  Nurse down --hillarious. A readers digest story of a nurse handling a cardiac arrest on a plane sucessfully, overhearing a passenger say \"Imagine she knew what to do without a doctor telling her what to do\" NM It would make all lives better if nurses and docs had to experience what each patient experiences. I had 4 years in the Operating Room.  If all post surgical nurses had more than a few days in the O.R. they would understand postop pain so much better. One thing I forgot re: the pain discussion was the AHCPR research established that \"nurses and doctors were the worst judges of a patients pain\". That was a tremendous finding.  Has anyone used ginger for nausea --it can work where other drugs fail. It does have a drug interaction with coumadin though. Time with DH calls.

AT the time it was being run in the lab he was taken up stairs. The number was unknown before I left the center. I came back shortly after five from a dental appt. The comment was made his BS was 52 and the gave him some crackers. The type with peanut butter. 4 out of 6 eaten. Greg's eyes were glased, response strange. Their resposne was that it helped with his confusion. No BS recheck. No recognition that this was a medical emergency. I have since found out they have no protocol for low BS. I got him in the car gave him 3 clucose tabs and food right away starting with wendy's ice cream--then 2 sandwiches. Problem is he hasn't been right since. How many brain cells were fried I have no clue. Well , 4 nurses didn't have a clue it was a frigging medical emergency. Or they were just figuiring I wouldn't know that -----------I am frigging tired of nurses that don't know what they should know. AND in a big center like that that they don't have a plan. Well i can fix it for the next person. But another part of Greg has been taken from me before it had to be. Bollix--great english word that is equivalent to fuck. Can keep you out of trouble when you really want to say fuck. Today a respiratory therapist and phelb tech came to to a radial stick. They went for the left arm that had a LIMB ALERT tag. I said he has a limb alert tag you can't use that arm. The resp tech said okay we'll use the right , but if we can't get it we'll use the left. I repeated he has a limb alet. She said if I can't get it from the right I will use the left. I said no way will you. She got huffy and made some comment I don't remember.  They got their stick. I called both sups. The hospital has a limb alert policy. Identified by a pink braclet on the affected limb. DUH. The resp. tech was completely willing to ignore policy. Bollix . If I hadn't been there she would have breeched policy and we may have not known it. WTF. The point of a policy is? If as I have said before, maybe not here, I had tracked the amount of errors between Greg and myself through out our cancer journey no one would believe me --they would say ahhhh your making it up.  WTF---------------I am not feeling kindly right now.  I have but a short time with him. AND all the DAMN errors are PISSING me off.   )(^%#@!@$&()_+. DS is seening it firsthand--finally. he would hear me tell stories and blow them off. Now he see's it with his own dad. I apologized to DS for my reaction in the situation. AND he said no mom you were right. He normaly reacts negatively to and raised voice.-----well he finaly gets it. DS's commennt of seeing what his dad has had to go through since brain cells were fried and then todays blatant disregard of written policy. He said I can't believe what you have been through and what you have had to do your whole life.  He has been camping in the hospital with  his dad and has the short lesson of what it means. ANd then this past weekend of his dad who had to pee maybe 20x's a night, wanted to change where he was sleeping maybex's a night. last nite in the hospital I made hash marks on the reverse board.  15 trips to BR, 1- urinal, 4 wandering cause I didn't wake up until I did wake up to find him in cupboards or trying to leave the room and there was no bed alarm. Tearing of his own clothing trying to get dressed because he was going to be dc'd at 6 am. Suspenders over the neck inside torn short but not attached. We pushed the bed against the wall immediately early on because DH said lets see how this works then threw his leg over the siderail. So, I pushed the bed against the wall to prevent him from getting out that side. Then he wanted to sleep in the recliner I obsconed with. Then he decided to sleep in the double bed provided for me.--no rails. First time in a 1 year and 3 months we slept in same bed. I figuired safe--i'll know when he's getting up-----WRONG that was the count of four in the wandering. BUT it was nice to be in the same bed again. I'm supposed to be sleeping now to relieve Ds in am. BUT i know y'all will underatnd . No explanation needed. I will go back now and read and see if I can offer anything, but I just needed to get this all out.  Thanks for all the support and NM your a trouper.",

Only have done the primal scream 7 times in my life. Finally learned to do it right after I think 3rd time. Anyways it was after the time I lost my voice for a week.  Frankly, I've mostly felt unusal after them --different each time  and  the sleep was deep and long.. Wonder if there's a sceince research project there. Diagnosed in DEC 08--didn't cry until June. highly don't recommend that. Haven't stopped since, it just rolls out in the most inconvenient places i.e.walking down a grocery isle.",

I didn't understand it. It'd almost come and then it would  hold back.Why I don't now. Maybe it was a nurse thing.  Even on the day my husband was dx'd with lymphoma 2 months after my mastectomies. Then it broke loose and flowing ever since. Thank God there were only 3(4 ?) primal screams, way to hurting. BUT I did realize I was In trouble and called a counselor same week. Great move, he has been an exceptional guide. Tell me please about the exersize thing. I'm still on restriction because of hip/knee/ patellas(kneecaps) bursitis and tendonitis caused by arimidex. Ortho doc will let me know when I can start moving more, at next visit. Oddly enough the PATELAR multiple problems caused by the arimidex -- the common name given for it was \"Runners Knee\". I definitely wasn't running. I thought it was ironic. Please, explainwhat it is about the hand slap? I'm new to forums and i can surmise what you are saying, but if you can define it would be appreciated. I've read all the rules and I'm quessing its refrencing the rules. As far as the bc we are pretty close. I started in July 08 towards an elective bilateral because of family history. Aug 08 mammo clean with see you next year letter and all. Next step Was a MRI. I put it off because there was no imperitive. DEC08 had it done only because of end of year and thinking of 09 deductbles.There it was a little bulb 0.8 cm. BUt it was xmas time. Anyways couldn't get on table to mid feb. from bx to amputation <3 weeks it went from grade 2 to grade 3, <1cm to 1.3 cm. So, the way I look at it, if I hadn't been working to get them off---i'd be gone now or end stage. Very aggressive in all 3 categories. Only joined in May because I wasn't up to it. To anyone reading my comment on Arimidex don't jump to conclusions about yourself. My body failed on chemo, and AI's. and other drugs. So, it's just my body. Lots of people sail well I didn't. I'll pass through again. thanks ---everyminute how can i send you aprivate message? edit addition 5/28/10. In mid feb 2010, I found out through a drug interaction program that is way more sofisticated than the usual--named Genelex--- that norvasc, a slow channel clacium blocker for hypertension, interacts with cytoxan, arimedix,femara and aromasin(last three all aromatase inhibitors. I likely was overdosed on all three drugs. I will never know  what would have been had the docs and pharmacists used this checker and advised me. I could have found a substitute for norvasc(amilodepine). Whats worse is they had the checker, but didn't use it. ",

      "Content": "Mar 14, 2010 03:38AM - edited Mar 14, 2010 04:43AM by sas-schatzi Everyminute, I found a commercial site that one can register at. I don't think bc.org allows identifying a site like this. It' a drug crosschecker, but also includes cytochrome 450 routesand supports their findings with reference links. It's totally different than any other site.  I basically found out, I failed chemo and aromatase inhibitors because of one antihypertensive drug I'm taking .Husband in chemo now. prognosis not good. Same drug is the interferring drug. We both stopped the drug. He has 2 weeks before next chemo which is just enough time for this drug to wear ofand the enzyme naturally produced to heal itself in the liver.. Based on their database, I learned that my 1st chemo that almost killed me, this antihypertensive drug was significantly causing and overdose and the overdose with arimidex and femara. SO, what do I do now . Obviously I'll tell the onc and show him the program. It also interferred with the effectiveness of my husbands first round of chemo. The whole thing I went through from april1 2009 until this week could have been avoided ,and my husband might not be in what the doc called\"salvage treatment\".  I stopped 2 of his drugs pre last chemo because of what I had learned and then learned about 2 other drugs that are causing his chemo not to work. I\"m a nurse at least for a short  time more. I didn't do what I've done in a vacuum (which means in nurse language I talked to the presrcibing doc's and asked about interrupting these drugs). BUT once I learned this stuff and talked with oncs and pharmisists and they didn't have a clue about what I was talking about, all I could do was cry, that the pain and suffering we have both gone through didn't have to be. ON all the chemotherapeuptic drugs I was on, I was being overdosed. All the horrific side effects I've had, you take this one drug out of the equation, and it brings me back to a standard dose level. I will never know know if I could have taken the 4 recommened chemo's or the AI's without all the damage they have caused to my body. AND the damage is not going away at this point. This program is way more sofisticated than things like drugs. com. Light years ahead. They not only cross referrence drugs they check how they are metabolized by the liver and if the drugs are going to change liver metabolism or renal excretion. This is huge. The particular liver metabolism site interferred with was cyp 3A4. There is no genetic testing for this route yet. BUT I could have controlled it by elimination of drugs that affect that route AT the beginning of my therapy and my husbands therapy. Yet my understanding of this site BC.ORG is you can't mention specific commercial products. Excuse me while I take a percocet. -----------ok back, question if someone sends me a private message can I tell them what the site is? I'm now on social security disability because of the damage done by drug interactions. How do I prevent this from happenning to someone else having to go through this. I'm going to have to give up Nursing. I wasn't ready to yet. BUT I have no choice----I am crippled by my life saving drugs because my docs 17 in total plus pharmisists didn't know to look for these interactions. They all had their own body part and the average drug database does not include what I'm talking about , so, a pharm doc couldn't answer the question if asked. No one wanted to look at what I\"ve just written about---why--time---not enough time . AND they don't now about the site. So, as many others , I've come to this site seeking ideas to lead to solutions, AND I found it on one thread, someone talked about genetic testing which started me on my search. I did the search and found this organization. Well, I'll take a chance that the moderators won't wipe me out on what follows. If ----I  with bc and my husband with lymphoma would not have been on a \"slow channel calcium blocker\" our chemo drugs would have worked more the way they were supposed to period blunt. There were other drugs in the equation we could have control over , but I won't mention them. The one common drug class was the group I mentioned above. Breaks my heart, he may die because of this . Thats how serious this group of drugs affected his treatment. For me, I may have a recurrence of bc, that didn't have to happen ,because like I said previously ,I could have followed the treatments. But since I was being overdosed on each drug, I as you would expect had GREATER SIDE EFFECTS. I fell into the category of \"NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE TREATMENT-- treatment discontinued.\"  or \"treatment failure\" ---doc speak for \"we don't know what went wrong\". I won't post the name of the  site tonight I would like one of the moderators to contact me. AND guide me through the process of what to do. I will be patient enough for a short while. I also am going to notify the company of my intent to post their name, because it could overwhelm their system. They are primarily set up to work with doctors offices and pharmacies that subscribe. The subscription fee for them is much higher . For individuals it's effectively $24 for the first family member and$18 for a second family member. There is also, an extension  on subscription if you refer someone. If you decide, whomever, to PM me on this I won't respond until both of the above have been accomplished. I gain nothing from this other than it has already set my husband and I on a different plan. The basic plan now is to make his next chemo's work better. I perfer the word cured vs salvage(which is doc speak means we don't have much hope) To all my sisters out there,pray that the moderators respond and the company responds well to this.-----------I have probably opened a hornets nest. ,but I quess a few stings are better than dying when there is a chance to prevent it because of an \"adverse drug event\" ADR, that can change chemotherapy response.",

PM me if you have trouble using  the Genelex site. It can be tricky. What is the antihypertensive your on? I think I might be at my max 5 for the night. you can go to google and use this \"list slow channel calcium blockers\". The best recommendation I have is to do the Genelex site-- plug in all your drugs after you have gone through the demo video and see what kind of drug interactions you may have.  I describe drugs.com drug interaction site as kindergarten level and genelex as grad school level for sofistication. So, don't be suprised at all the info you come up with. There are thousands of drug interactions per year that can be prevented. AND yes some of those interactions may make you present as \"crazy\" and/or make you feel crazy. ",

No one ,but someone whom needs to scream it out can go. Anyone wanting to rant or vent can safely let go without someone coming in behind them and telling them how  to behave or whatever. We 've all had our moments. And there is nothing more frustrating than being in the middle of a primal scream because your heart is breaking or you're angry about whatever and you just want to blow off steam ----and someone says \"x\". that only makes what your feeling worse. If the page is named i.e. \"For ranting , screaming, venting only--Getting rid of my anger. Then it informs readers not to enter.

Continueing on the snri Savella for fibromyalgia , fentanyl, oxy, and ativan. Already moderating dose lower. Only 2 doses of oxy in last three weeks.Exercise everyday has made a HUGE difference and live with some pain. My old prebmx pain--post polio would be a blessing , I could handle that with very occassional pain meds. Now I feel like a person on drugs. Genelex coorporation is the site for the drug interaction checker. 30 day free trial. Very cheap for subscription.  The further I get away from the AIs, I beleive the damage is improving. It makes the word HOPE brighten up,sparkle and shine more---very nice. Husband and his doc's have abandon any thoughts of looking at drug interactions. They just order drugs and he takes them. Knowing full well of the interactions.  AND it's not that they know more------ the ones involved admit they don't know what the info is telling them. It's above their knowledge level. I think there's a phrase about horse and leading them to water, but you can't make them drink. You can't make someone learn if they don't want too.",
