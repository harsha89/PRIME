Even though I still have edema everywhere. Some of your posts were from 10 years ago. Did anyone get a resolution to the fluid retention??",

I go next week. They work more with diuretics. Hopefully they can help manage it for me. My last chemo was Jan. 2nd. Hopefully it will start to resolve soon. Thank you for sharing your journey. It gives me hope it will resolve.",
