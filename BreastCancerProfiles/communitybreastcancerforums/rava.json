The 20 of september I found a lump in my rigth breast. I got an apointment with my doctor and she confirmed it. The national guide lines here in Norway says \"wait and see\" for young women with lumps in their breasts ... She first told me we should wait for up to 2 months with regular check ups on the lump. I must say I was very concerned. After two weeks I went back to my doctor. She then forund a lump under my right arm as well I got a mammogram, ultrasound and a biopsy. I was told that \"this is not a innocent cyst\". The lump is 3,5 cm on it`s longest and lies under the nipple and a little over to one side. It looked like a sausage, the radiologist said.. She also did an UL og the lump under my arm...She looked concerned, but could not give me an answer on weather it was malignant or not.... Tomorrow I`v got an appointment with a surgeon at the hospital... Have been waithing now for over a week to get the results.... Ooohlala, I`m soo excited feel sick... My husband will join me, I really hope I can sleep tonight... MX 11.8.11 no recon. Medullary carcinoma. Ki67 84% starting chemo 12.16.11 FEC 100 x 4 Taxotere x 4. 17 cycles of Herceptin. 25 rads.
