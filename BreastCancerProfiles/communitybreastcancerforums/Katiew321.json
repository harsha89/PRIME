However, a few days ago when the last of my stitches came out my breast is now feeling quite sore and as if there is a lump there where the tumour was. I was just wondering if this was normal or not?

I've read on many online articles that a lot of people experience lumps after surgery, my surgeon also told me this. I wanted to post first before calling my doctor incase anyone had experienced this or if it was normal :)",
