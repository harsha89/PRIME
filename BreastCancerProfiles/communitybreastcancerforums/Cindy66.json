Have finished five years of arimidex and now in MD Anderson trial to see if taking a drug like arimidex for 10 years would help all of us. Best advice I ever got was from another cancer patient. Treat this as just another adventure on life's path. After reflecting on the past six years I have learned alot about myself and my family. Life is good as miserable as you feel some days. We were never promised a perfect trip.Â ",
