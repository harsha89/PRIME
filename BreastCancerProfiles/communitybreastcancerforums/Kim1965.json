Mine burning is front ,sides, back in my chest area and moving down towards my belly. I dont sllep much at night and am most confortable on couch sitting up. Certain fabrics are worse than others. Im told it must be from nerves and they cant do anything for me. I was hoping to go back to work after week 3 and I'm in week 10 and only working few hours a few days a week because of this burning. I seem better in my tight fitted bra for about 4 hours and rhen it must come off! Im sure hoping we can be patient, but this is exhausting",
