My RO says radiation doesn't cause nausea and so did his nurse. I've had it since Friday. On and off but different than chemo nausea. Just curious if anyone else has this. Thanks, Kate  ",

My oncologist ordered a nuelasta injection and I spent most of the week feeling like I had the flu or a cold but no bone pain. Yesterday, 1/22 my wbc was 5.7 so I received the infusion and other than a headache and hoarseness I\u2019m feeling ok. Just a little jumpy stomach. I got a nuelasta on pro placed and it should go off at 5:40 today. I\u2019m trying to drink as much as I can and sometimes I just hate the thought but know I have to do it. I\u2019m 65, and the other board I follow is starting chemo Nov 2017. Many of the gals are young, none are on CMF. But many are taking the same meds I have for nausea and reflux. I used senekot S and that has really helped. When chemo is over I\u2019ll have 16 radiation treatments. I guess the question I\u2019d really like to ask is how are you doing now? Any lasting side effects, chemo brain, or any of the other awful things we worry about. I\u2019m worried about the chemo brain combined with my 65 year old brain. And, of course, does CMF really work. My oncotype score was 26, which even surprised my oncologist and she felt with CMF I had the best chance for a cure. I never hesitated with the decision.

Some of the earlier posts on this page will give you more information. I kept a log of how I felt, what I did and drank, etc. Everyone experiences chemo a little differently. My main complaint was constipation, solved by miralax and senakot, and a jumpy burping feeling in my stomach solved by nothing. I kept my hair, gained about 15 lbs.(thank you steroids) and never had diarrhea. So all and all not bad but when you are going through treatment it\u2019s all a little scary.

When I started CMF last fall I found so little information and I was still in shock. Little by little others joined this group and although I haven\u2019t posted in a long time I still follow everyone. My 8 CMF treatments ended on April 8, 2018 and I finished radiation June 5th. I had the nuelasta onpro and regained my white blood cells by the next chemo. In July I developed a seroma after radiation. A seroma is a pocket of fluid that can develop and often resolves on its own. Mine needed to be drained a few times and finally surgically drained and debrided. I\u2019m told I had a 1 1/2 -2 inch open area that required twice daily packing. I say I\u2019m told because I never looked at it and once I could shower I showered with my eyes closed. My best friend who did the packing and the dressing kindly provided no description but she faithfully took a daily picture to track my progress and determine day to day if it was really getting better. Finally by mid September it began to rapidly heal and by mid October had resolved. At this point I feel great and go for my first ultrasound and mammogram in Mid December. At my oncologists urging I had genetic testing due to my dad having stomach cancer and all 9..of his sibblings as well. My testing came back showing the ATM gene which is linked to pancreatic cancer so in January I will have an endoscopy and alternate with MRI every other year. I hope your take away after reading this will be that in spite of the seroma and the concern over the genetic test I feel great and I survived my first year after diagnosis feeling like I am back to normal. We will all keep worrying when treatment is over but at least I\u2019ve got a target to keep checking. I\u2019ll report back regarding the endoscopy and the mammogram, and I\u2019ll let you know if I ever get brave enough to look at those pictures of my seroma Best to all, Kate",

Unlike lots of you I am not particularly into exercise routines or supplements, acupuncture or message. Maybe that stuff will help you feel better sooner than me. I can tell you this though, at the one year mark of the completion of chemo I\u2019m back to mowing our very large complicated lawn by hand, carrying 40 lb salt bags, and I\u2019m the one that carries the heavy groceries from the car into the house.

I don\u2019t have any underlying conditions, but I did have a couple vices. Drinking a beer or two a day, and smoking. My oncologist made it very clear that I needed to limit myself to 1 drink per week which we negotiated to a few a week and to stop smoking. I don\u2019t smoke much. Less than a pack a week. Initially I started on an every 3 week schedule without nuelasta. Then when my white blood count got critically low my oncologist gave me a nuelasta injection and set a new infusion #3 date of 1/22/18. By 1/22 my counts were great and I received a nuelasta pod after that infusion. A little heads up about that. It worked flawlessly and after it was placed I never felt a thing, but that happy lady in the commercials obviously wasn\u2019t filmed when it was placed. Two minutes after it\u2019s placed you\u2019ll feel a BIG prick and I wasn\u2019t prepared for that. It subsides immediately but it was quite startling. Here is what I learned. Take Claritin a couple days before nuelasta pod and a few days after. People have felt bone pain but I have not had that problem. Claritin is an antihistamine and some magic happens and it helps curb bone pain. The drugs are constipating. It took me a few treatments to realize I needed a better bowel management routine. I take a dose of miralax morning and nite and two senakot S at night. I started 2 days before chemo #3 and #4 and it kept constipation to a minimum. The anti nausea drugs and steroids are also constipating but absolutely take them as instructed and hopefully a bowel management protocol (mine or something your oncologist recommends) will prevent constipation. Get a variety of your favorite drinks, juice, water, flavored water, ice tea, lemonade and some popsicles. You need to drink about 2 quarts of water, etc each day starting a few days before your first infusion. I say get a variety of stuff to drink because even if you love ice tea you will get tired of the same drink. I\u2019m much happier alternating what I drink. I have never been a big water drinker and there are days where I look at a glass of lemonade and want to throw it across the room. Once this is over I plan on consuming less fluid but you want to stay hydrated and my oncologist said make half of your fluid water and half other stuff. The popsicles come in handy when no other drinks sound good. If you are hydrated your veins are plumper and easier to start the infusion. Bring a little blanket or sweatshirt or sweater in case you are cold and ask for a heated blanket. It\u2019s comforting to be warm. If something doesn\u2019t feel right once the infusion starts make sure you tell the nurse. The first infusion you have they will probably tell you exactly what they are doing and how it will feel. It shouldn\u2019t hurt, it shouldn\u2019t burn or sting, and if you start to get a slight headache tell the nurse. Sometimes they have to slow the infusion. My total infusion time is about 1 1/4 hours. It\u2019s pretty quick compared to other chemo. The drugs that are in a syringe and go in via your IV are timed and injected slowly. By that I mean 5-7 minutes each. Bring some water to drink, a snack, gum or hard candy. It will give you something to do. Lots of people bring their iPads, books, or magazines. When the infusion is over it will beep and you\u2019ll be unhooked. I probably could drive to and from chemo but I have a friend who comes with me and does the driving. Usually the day of chemo I feel pretty good and the day after but about day 3-6 I am tired but able to work. If your blood count is low you will feel extremely tired and you need to rest and stay away from people or wear a mask. If you can plan chemo on a Thursday you will have the weekend to relax. Sometimes that\u2019s not possible. My major complaints (aboutCMF) are all the people who will tell you how easy it is because sometimes it isn\u2019t easy. The constipation was concerning until I got on the right pre chemo and post chemo routine of miralax and Senakot S. I hate all the fluid but that\u2019s just me. I have had an ongoing jumpy feeling in my stomach causing me to burp often. It\u2019s annoying. I never had reflux but I do now and I\u2019m taking ranitidine for it 2xs a day. I have not lost my appetite, I have not been nauseas to the point of vomiting, and I have not had diarrhea. I do have general fatigue and by the end of the work day I\u2019m ready to put on my pjs. I\u2019m sorry you are doing this alone and I would be happy to support you any way I can. I\u2019d also suggest you do some shopping and get things in your house that are easy to prepare and handy. I have not lost my appetite no matter how jumpy my stomach has felt. In fact my oncologist said CMF actually can increase your weight. I\u2019m living proof, but it might be the cookies and root beer floats. Good luck to you. Let me know if you have any questions about anything. I have found the groups here to be very supportive and the search feature will point you to lots of information. Best to you, Kate      ",

My white blood count has dropped by the 7-8th day after chemo and I got a shot of nuelasta 8 days after my blood work showed the low wbc. My oncologist scheduled chemo #3 for a week later and my counts were great. I had the nuelasta onpro placed after chemo #3 and I also had it after chemo #4 and #5. Getting it after each chemo should keep your counts from going low and staying low. Now my chemos will continue every two weeks until I complete chemo #8. Following chemo and about 30 days in between I will begin 16 radiation treatments. A lot of people have had bone pain from the nuelasta and suggest taking Claritin a few days before chemo and a few days after. I\u2019ve done that and I haven\u2019t had any bone pain. The nuelasta stimulates your immune system which creates histamines. The Claritin is an antihistamine and will prevent bone pain. Don\u2019t take the Claritin D. Just take the regular Claritin. One more thing about the nuelasta. If you\u2019ve seen the commercials of the lady and her husband so happy she has the onpro I think they should show you the look on her face when the onpro sticks her in the arm 2-3 minutes after its put in place. I think knowing I will be stuck by a tiny tiny needle in 3 minutes makes me overly sensitive and each time the shock of it has almost made me jump out of the chair. It really doesn\u2019t hurt but it does startle you. That\u2019s the only prick you will feel. When it starts injecting the nuelasta 27 hours later you don\u2019t feel a thing. Drink, drink, drink as much as you can. Best of luck. You will be fine. Ask any questions you think of. One last thing. Start a daily log book and write down what meds you take,what you drink, and if you poop and how you feel. I look back on it all the time and it helps me to know if I felt well enough to go to work, or if I spent the day on the couch. Good luck, Kate ",

I had 2 infusions 3 weeks apart then I began getting an infusion every 2 weeks with nuelasta. I had chemo #7 yesterday! Chemo #8 is scheduled for April 9th then I will have 16 radiation treatments. A couple times I\u2019ve had to have 3 weeks between treatments after starting the every two week schedule. Once, because my white blood count was too low and once because I caught a 24 hour bug and got dehydrated the day before treatment. When I started treatment I was really worried about everything. Would I get sick, would I lose my hair, would I be too sick to work, would I get constipated. But my major issue in the beginning was constipation which was solved with miralax am/pm the day of treatment and for about 3 days after and 2 senakot S every morning. I didn\u2019t come up with this strategy right away. It took a couple treatments for me to realize I needed to start taking something before treatment and a few days after. My stomach has been upset and jumpy since I started treatment. Not real nausea tho. My hair might be slightly thinner. I have kept a daily log of how I\u2019ve felt each day and it helps to look back and see how each treatment has effected me and there is nothing really predictable about treatment in terms of when fatigue will strike which is often out of nowhere with a two week schedule I am barely recovered from treatment if I had it to do over I think I\u2019d go with the every three weeks By the time you get to your third treatment I think u will feel more in control of what\u2019s happening and what to expect. I have not experienced much dizziness. I would call it unsteadiness if I move too quickly. Having a variety of favorite drinks is helpful for me. I hate drinking water but I have gotten better at it. I have some sort of drink in front of me every waking hour. If you get a chance read back on this thread and there may be something helpful there. My oncologist has ordered something new to try and combat my jumpy stomach. She thinks a liter of fluid the day after treatment will help. I had my first one today. We will see because nothing I\u2019ve taken has helped with that. I\u2019m wishing you the best. You might also want to look and see if anyone started a group of people starting chemo in March or April 2018. They might not be on CMF but the day to day thoughts, experiences, etc I have found helpful. On the days I feel pretty awful and sick of this whole thing I can always find someone who feels the same way or worse. Somehow that\u2019s helped me. Ask any question you have. Good luck, Kate     ",

If you read previous posts constipation was an initial problem but miralax and senakot S have kept that problem under control. Drinking water and extra fluids is challenging.

I finished my last chemo on 4/9 and by the end I was so happy to be finished. My jumpy stomach and fatigue continued for about 3 weeks and everyday I kept wondering if I\u2019d ever feel better again. By the time I started radiation I have to say I felt almost normal. I\u2019ve had 15 radiation treatments and I\u2019ve got 6 more to go. Other than fatigue I feel pretty darn good. I have kept most of my hair, just a little thinning, and some foods taste weird, but I really feel better than I thought I would. During the chemo if someone told me I\u2019d feel good again I wouldn\u2019t have believed them but I\u2019m here to tell you that you really will feel better. It was good to have a month to recover from chemo and once radiation started I felt like I could finally see the end of treatment. I\u2019ve had 15 of 21 treatments and they are quick, easy, and painless. I have a little redness but nothing terrible and aloevera and aquaphor help. That combination is a bit greasy but I picked up a package of men\u2019s white tee shirts and they are comfortable to sleep in and I don\u2019t have to worry my pjs will suffer. My fatigue is still present but it seems to show up after I\u2019ve been busy mowing or going up and down the stairs doing laundry. The chemo does make you photosensitive so my oncologist really stressed staying covered up, wearing 100 SPF sunscreen and staying hydrated. I\u2019ve been walking everyday and that has been nice. We have a rail trail nearby so I don\u2019t have to go far to find a nice safe walking place. I do lose my balance so I carry a walking stick which really helps. Hope this helps to know what I\u2019ve experienced. Everyone is different and your experience may be better and hopefully no worse. I hope everyone keeps writing to let us all know how you\u2019re doing. When I started CMF I couldn\u2019t find a group on this site so I started this one and I hope any new people that enter this group can gain something from all of us. Good luck to all, Kate  ",

I saw my oncologist who took one look at my vacation weary breast and after squeezing more fluid out she called my surgeon and told her I needed to have the area looked at immediately. Saw the surgeon and she said the plan will be to schedule surgery to open up the area, debrid it and pack it so it could heal from the inside out. I was so discouraged at this point I wanted this over now. Had the surgery two days later and came home with a packed and draining incision. Still dont know what the cultures showed this time. My surgeon is currently on vacation and my follow up with my surgeons partner is 7/30. The PA at my oncologist looked at the area today and reassured my friend that the dressing looked good and that was a big relief I write this saga so anyone that has an infected seroma can read the process of getting rid of it and I\u2019ll keep you all updated. The last 5 radiation boosts I blame for this but who knows why it happened. Kate",

This is a great group. Any questions you have I\u2019m sure someone here can answer. I agree about having a choice, making it and not being able to even consider the risk of not doing chemo. When I was presented with information related to my breast cancer it was clear to me chemo was the route to take. Though it wasn\u2019t always easy many of us have gotten thru it with minimal side effects that were controlled through trying things people in this group experienced and tried. Everyone experiences chemo differently but here is hoping you sail through it. Kate",

Originally the plan was lumpectomy and radiation. When I started the CMF I was scheduled every 3 weeks and after treatment 2 the schedule was excellerated to every two weeks. I\u2019m 65 and in fairly good shape with no serious health concerns but I had to delay my chemo 6 for an extra week due to a 24 hour bug that left me dehydrated. I really wished I had just done every 3 weeks because every two weeks makes me feel like I\u2019ve barely recovered. So for me if I had to do it over I would say just give me chemo every 3 weeks. But, keep in mind that everyone responds differently and age, oncotype score, grade of cancer, and your oncologist all factor in regarding your course of treatment. My biggest complaint has been a reflux stomach upset issue that nothing seems to help. I had constipation early on but if you read back I came up with a routine to combat that problem. I have kept my hair, the treatment time is about 1 1/2 to 2 hours so all and all not a bad chemo relative to what others have undergone. If I had a bit more information about your previous treatment I might have a different opinion. Ask any questions you have and I\u2019ll try to answer them. I check this forum every day. Best of luck, Kate",

The first lumpectomy did not have clear margins so I had another 2 weeks later. My tumor/ tissue samples were sent to California and my oncotype score came back at 26 placing me in the intermediate risk for recurrence and CMF was the recommended treatment. I think that everyone I\u2019ve been in contact with has given me choices about treatment I really don\u2019t feel qualified to decide. Do you want a mastectomy, do you want to do chemo and radiation. More than once I\u2019ve wanted to say, why are you asking me what I want, how should I know. I\u2019m 65, in good health and my tumor was small with no node involvement so CMF has less side effects, is tried and true and been around for a long time so there\u2019s lots of research about the treatment and I\u2019m confident that CMF is right for me. I\u2019ve done some of my own research and it\u2019s helped me feel comfortable with the plan. Do you know your oncotype score? If my score had been lower I would probably just do radiation but with a score of 26 I can\u2019t take a chance. Good luck to you, Kate",

The infusion is relativequick compared to other types of chemo. It usually took 1.5 hours. Two drugs are slowly injected into your IV and the Cytoxin is a drip. Constipation was my main issue and as time went on just fatigue. I took miralax and senakot S for constipation and tried to pace myself. I have kept almost all of my hair and never had any diarrhea and only 1-2 mild issues with vomiting. The whole thing was scary and I kept waiting for awful things to happen. My white blood count did drop really low and the nuelasta pod helped with that. I needed a couple IV infusions of fluid because I was dehydrated in spite of drinking more water and other stuff than I ever had in my life. I am hoping you get through this with no weird issues. I hope you will let us know how you do today. I'll check this site regularly to be available if you have any. Questions I can answer. Good luck today. I'll be thinking of you. I finish my last of 21 radiation treatments today. Radiation has been a breeze. Kate",

After a day or two I felt ok but I always had a jumpy feeling in my stomach and reflux. Midway I started feeling like I couldn\u2019t face another treatment because I was so tired of feeling unwell. When I got to treatment number 8 if they said I needed a ninth treatment I would have said Hell No!!! Fatigue in between treatments would come on suddenly and sometimes it was unpredictable. Other times I was wiped out after doing laundry or snow shoveling. Once I finished chemo I rarely had fatigue. Now that I\u2019m past chemo that ended 4/8 and past radiation that ended today I have to say I feel much less fatigue and I\u2019m back to doing almost everything I did before. Now my only issue is occasional nausea every few days. I\u2019m not sure how common that feeling is. I do think we will all have different responses and it has all been very scary and unnerving to go through. Knowing there are other people that have gone thru CMF and radiation and reading about their experiences has been so helpful and encouraging. I will keep checking in if you have any other questions or just want to vent. Good luck to you. This is truly a club no one wants to belong to, but thank god it\u2019s full of helpful, kind people. You\u2019ll get through this. Take care. Sending positive thoughts. Kate",

The first time I thought I was getting a cold and by the second and third time I went back to my handy notebook and read what I wrote about that feeling. I hope you don\u2019t have a cold. I know we all get worried about becoming ill. I\u2019ve written before about chemo and about radiation and I was feeling pretty darn good, and suddenlywithin a couple days after oncology appointment my breast became very hard, very painful and I started to run a fever. This fell in to the \u201c no one told me about this\u201d category. Thank god for this forum. I was able to look up stuff and made an appointment with my oncologist who immediately fit me in once she heard my symptoms. I had a crazy day from oncology to hospital for a CT scan then to another hospital to be admitted and put on IV antibiotics. Everyone kept saying what I had was an an abscess, but what I looked up pointed to a seroma. Which is a void from surgery that can fill with blood, pus or fluid. I had 80 ccs of fluid drained and I was sent home with doxycycline and oxycodone. 3 days later the void filled again and I went back to my surgeon who was the admitting doctor and she drained another 40 ccs. It felt good after that but by my follow up appointment yesterday she wanted to drain it again and got another 7 ccs. She said the culture from the hospital showed staph and she changed my antibiodic from doxycycline to Bactrum. She said I should go buy a lotto ticket because I was a rare case. I would prefer being a someone who presented with a very common easily solved issue that the doctor had seen a million times, but she said I was the first. So today I have not decided how I feel yet. I\u2019m still sore but who knows. I. Write this so somewhere at sometime if a person developed this they can find this post. I\u2019ll continue to update over the course of this. Cross your fingers and say a prayer this gets better. We are headed to Raquette Lake in the Adirondacks for our yearly week of family and fun and the closest hospitals are a good distance away. I\u2019ll be armed with my cold packs, six packs and thermometer. The upside of Bactrum is that moderate drinking is allowed! Good luck to all and hang in there. Cancer opens your eyes to the good things and people in your life and has given me a very deep appreciation for both, but it does scare the crap out of you with every bump in the road. Kate   ",

I\u2019m so glad so many people have shared their experiences. My chemo ended in April of 2018 after 8 treatments and then I had radiation which ended in June 2018. Today, I feel fantastic! It took a few weeks to feel better after chemo (just in time to start radiation) but the relief of finishing chemo was an immediate emotional sense of calm and I knew I could start to get back to normal. There might be days you think the final treatment will never come, but trust me, it does and you really will be back to normal. Keep a positive attitude, ask for help if you need it,and take care of you as much as you can. You can do this and you will get to the other side of treatment and get back to everything you enjoyed before. In my case, I enjoy everything more than ever. Good luck, and I\u2019ll be checking here to hear how you are doing, 19501952, Kate",

I picked up plain ole Colgate and alcohol free mouth wash. I\u2019ve only heard from one other person who had CMF so I\u2019m going to be posting about this treatment and how it goes. Good luck to everyone.",

Stayed home next day, went to work Thursday didn't feel Good Friday and stayed home. Had some constipation issues and took Colace and ducalx which helped. My anti nausea med wasn't working well and my doctor called in a script for compazin. My main problem isnt really nausea it's reflux. At least I think its reflux. Has anyone else had that issue. I'm going to call the oncologist tomorrow and talk to someone but I just wondered if anyone had the problem and what they did about it. Other than being tired and still being in shock that I even need chemo I feel pretty good. No mouth sores but obviously somethings causing this reflux. Thanks for any advise and god bless everyone of you. Kate",

A friend I bumped into at the market told me she is starting her new job at the infusion center where I receive treatment. Maybe that will be a good thing. Time will tell. Still not hearing from many people currently or ever on CMF. cyclophosphamide, methatrexate and fluorouracil. I\u2019m just this past week feeling back to normal and we will see how this round goes. Happy Holidays to everyone. Kate",

I feel like all I do is take one drug after the other as I'm sure everyone here does too. I think if it doesn't feel a little better soon I'll take an Aleve or Motrin. The pain may also be a result of leaning over my computer as I sit on my couch working from home. I keep thinking I will wake up and all of this is a very bad dream. So many of you seem to handle everything that is thrown your way. I hope I can be as brave. Kate",

I\u2019m going to have blood work on 1/8 and see the oncologist 1/9 and maybe start on a two week schedule. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got this Christmas break to rest and not miss work. I go back on 1/2. Hopefully the students don\u2019t come back sick. I don\u2019t have a lot of direct contact but still worry. If we have any big flu issue I can work from home Happy New Year to all!",

If my temperature is 99.1 do I take Tylenol or just let my temperature raise if it\u2019s going to go up? I keep feeling worse and worse after the neaulasta shot I got on Monday. Last night dry heaves; palms tingling super tired. Today I have zero appetite and I\u2019m still totally wiped out. Is this normal? It\u2019s scary. I\u2019m never sick and this just seems crazy to feel worse and worse. I called oncology yesterday to let them know I have a cold. At least I think that\u2019s what it is but I keep feeling worse not better no matter how much I rest or what I do. If this is all normal to feel like this I sure would be relieved. Thanks for any thoughts you gals might have. Kate",

You know when I first got diagnosed the surgeon, oncologist and radiologist were so positive I'd sail right through this. After the first lumpectomy I didn't have clear margins and had to have a rexcision that produced clear results. All my doctors thought I'd have radiation then be fine. When my oncotype score turned out to be 26 they were all surprised. I wish they had been less positive from the beginning. Then setbacks and test results might be easier to take. Now I want to say, really, you're sure about that? So I'll try not to worry but that whole trust thing has been eroded. Kate                  Core ",

Rljes, I had chemo #5 on the 19th and I feel like this is the worst so far as well. I almost didn\u2019t make it walking around the market today and just walking a short distance down the road last week I was short of breath. First time in my life for that. I\u2019m happy to report I\u2019ve finally come up with a good routine for constipation. 2 days before chemo and 3 days after I\u2019ve taken a dose of miralax in the morning and night and 2 SenakotS at night and I\u2019ve had no problems! My stomach continues to feel jumpy and I burp all day which makes me a little nauseas and probably makes anyone that hears me feel sick as well. I\u2019ve been taking ranitidine 2 times a day but today I got so Prilosec and I\u2019m hoping that it works better. I also had a little issue with my oncologist who ordered cipro the last time my wbc dropped and her PA ordered it a second time when my counts were low again. She literally jumped out of her chair saying Cipro and methatrexate are very dangerous to take and who ordered that. Telling her she did seemed to make her more agitated and she blamed the PA. So, I wrote down my chemo drugs for my pharmacist so they can flag any drugs that interact. I wished I had thought of that before. Now my oncologist has cancelled all my blood work in between treatments because she said we know it will show very low wbc. I still feel awful with my stomach issues and tiredness. Hopefully I can make it to work tomorrow. I had the whole week of chemo 5 off for winter break. Good thing. Kate",

So in theory it made sense to me. The oncologists reaction to me saying I was on cipro again for a second time and telling me to stop immediately made me look up the interaction with methatrexate. What I read was scary. Not only does it interact, but it could cause your body not to show the typical signs of infection like runny nose, headache, temperature and it can cause antibiodic resistant issues. I think my pharmacist would have flagged this if she knew I was taking the CMF drugs so I dropped off a list so they would be in my record. I think it\u2019s one thing to trust your doctor, but they make mistakes and this was a serious one so I am always going to do my own research every time there are changes in my treatment. Lesson learned! I\u2019m hoping the Prilosec works. I\u2019m headed to work now still feeling crappy. Have a great day everybody. Kate",
