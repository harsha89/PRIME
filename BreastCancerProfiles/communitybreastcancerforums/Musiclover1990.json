She did not even do an Exam or even look at my breast she told to Pay attention to if they change through out My cycle and that if i was still concerned she would examine me at my next appointment which is This September so i left feeling calmer and pushed it to the back burner until now cause tonight while standing in front the mirror before my shower i could slightly see the cluster of lumps then i place hand on the back of my head the way I always have done for myself exam and i could see the lumps so clearly it looked like about 5 rocks with rough edges all together then i did it to the other side no visible lumps but on feeling i felt one single lump near my armpit the had the rock like feeling . My husband was very concerned and feels i need to call my doctor tomorrow im just thinking maybe when i described it to my doctor she knew it was nothing to be concerned about and maybe I'm just being a worry wort is it worth getting seen sooner ?
