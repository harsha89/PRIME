Radiologist said it was 2cm, then he said 1 cm then he said, it is really tiny like a pea, and finished up saying he was 90% certain it was benign. So much of not what he said bothered me but how he said it and his facial expression saying it. I read faces and his told me that his number one priority was to not freak me out. I haven't had any constant pain, but a shooting pain every now and then. I get a biopsy done Monday morning, and that was another thing, the radiologist said I needed one as soon as possible and that if I didn't that lump would grow to twice the size in no time. So I am worried also. I believe that my worry an anxiety is making me sick already. I can't even bring myself to share this with anyone including my husband of 34'years as I don't want anyone's live to change. Good luck to you youngjane, I will pray for the best outcome for you.",
