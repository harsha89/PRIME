It shows I am stage 0 - I am actually stage IV with mets to bones and liver. There is so much information I need to enter and decided to just do it later. I too, just finished up a year with mets to liver and am on Xeloda. Have been doing super and just had appointment this past Friday and markers are a tad up. I am not sure what meds you are on right now, but Xeloda hasn't really given me any terrible side effects. My oncologist is looking at Aromasin/Afinator for next treatment if Xeloda decides to stop working. There is another one he mentioned called Doce.... something. That would require a port again and I am just not feeling that!! I told him he would have to talk me into intravenous meds, because I said never again. We'll see. A word of encouragement- we are all so different and people with mets to liver can do well and live well with faith and the rightmedication. Eight years and three dx and this is my first post. Happy New Year to you and yours!  Jen",
