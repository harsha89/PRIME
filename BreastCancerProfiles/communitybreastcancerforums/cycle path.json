I don't feel one causes the other, but rather that they are both caused by the same or a similar thing. I hate it when I can't keep my digestive issues under control! I hope you're asking a doc for help with the bloating problem. ",

Let's talk about modesty. I'm all for modesty in public, but let's face it -- these doctors and technicians have seen the breasts and other so-called private parts of thousands, maybe tens of thousands of women. Looking at your breast is, to them, the same as looking at your arm. It's just not special or different to them. When they're looking at you they're not looking at something private, they're looking at what they need to look at to help you. Try to keep this in mind during your examinations. \"Modesty\" doesn't come into it - modesty is about showing and covering what's appropriate to show or cover in a particular situation. It's appropriate to cover up in your daily life, but \"appropriateness\" goes out the window when a medical examination is going on. The person examining you has seen many thousands of body parts and is not thinking about your body parts in any sort of improper way. Keep this in mind and try to relax. You'll be happier, be more comfortable, and may even get better results if you can be relaxed.",

As far as feeling strong and healthy, I think breast cancer only makes people feel ill when they are in very late stages. I never felt different, and I don't recall hearing anyone else (other than late stage people or those in chemo, etc.) say they felt ill. Estrogen negative: the reason that's not so good is that there are fewer treatments available. The standard treatment for these non-invasive tumors is lumpectomy, radiation, and Tamoxifen, but Tamoxifen is only effective against the estrogen-positive tumors, or so I understand.  It's true the cancer could come back after lumpectomy because of a small amount of tissue left. That's why they do radiation -- to fry any stray cancer cells after the surgery. The bigger problem is this: once you've had breast cancer, any kind of breast cancer, you're identified as being at risk for getting it again. It's sort of like kidney stones -- once you've had one kidney stone you're identified as a \"stone former\" and you're more likely to get another one than the person next door who's never had a stone. I hope that helps explain things a little. It sounds to me as though your situation is pretty good, since you apparently have a non-invasive cancer. You'll get through this and in the end you'll be fine!  ",

It seems a little silly to make it part of the External Radiation section, doesn't it? Further: some of the info on the IORT page is incorrect. \"all the doctors and nurses must leave the room while intraoperative radiation is delivered.\" Not true, because some IORT is delivered via X-ray and personnel need only be shielded as for a normal X-ray. \"Using intraoperative radiation for internal radiation is very new. Only small studies with short follow-ups have been done so far.\" Not true -- IORT has been available since 1918. \"Intraoperative internal radiation hasn't been compared to the standard of care: whole-breast radiation after lumpectomy.\" Untrue.   \"It's very expensive to have a radiation machine and proper shielding in an operating room. Most radiation therapy departments are far away from the operating rooms, so the equipment can't be shared or moved.\" While it's true that it's expensive to have this, it's also not necessary because some IORT machines use Xray only and no shielding is required in the OR. Also, some IORT machines are highly portable. The article is out of date and appears to have been written by a MO who is opposed to the use of IORT (probably for personal financial reasons). An updated and much less biased article should be provided, but either way there should be links! ",

IMO anyone who has BC symptoms and who has a strong family history like yours needs to be given very serious attention. It sounds to me as though you have an insurance policy with which you have \"gatekeeper\" doctors who must approve visits to specialists. Is that correct? Whereabouts do you live? What's the process for getting past the gatekeeper? Does your insurance have gatekeeper doctors who are OB-GYNs? Are you in a financial position that would allow you to pay out-of-pocket for a consultation with a breast surgeon out-of-network?   (Pardon the weird formatting above.

I have told (tactfully, I hope) a lot of women here that they were overreacting but I don't feel you're one who is. My understanding of family history is that first degree relatives are given more weight for non-BRCA BC, but I believe once BRCA is involved it doesn't matter so much if they're first or second degree. I also think, but am not sure, that if you have a whole pile of second and third degree relatives who had BC, that's equivalent to having at least one first-degree relative. The other big warning sign is a male relative who had BC. That's a pretty significant risk factor. HOWEVER! None of this means you have BC or will ever have it, so you still shouldn't get freaked out. What it does mean is that you're at higher risk, and therefore something that would be a small niggling concern for someone else needs to be taken more seriously in your case. ",

Move your non-surgical side next to the door jamb and reach up as far as you can with your non-surgical hand. Get someone to mark the highest point you can reach.  Then turn around and spider-walk up the door jamb with your surgical side. See how far you can go, marking the highest point if you wish. Do this a few times every day. The goal is to get to the same height as on the non-surgical side.  ",

Probably all of us have at least been disappointed in some way by at least one person's reaction. In the defense of these people, though, I have to say I think it's hard to know how to react. Recently I met someone who mentioned he had cancer. I was about to ask him about it but the conversation was interrupted and I didn't get the chance. A few days later I asked someone else who knows him what kind of cancer he has and what's going on, and she said she didn't know because she thought it was \"rude\" to ask him about it. I can think of people I know who got cancer and I never really talked to them about it. I wasn't sure what to ask about. Sometimes I was afraid they'd get too emotional, sometimes I thought I was intruding.   I think it's hard to know how to react. I had DCIS, and my attitude is that it's pretty much a done deal for me -- I need to be watchful for the rest of my life, but that's it. But a lot of people I see ask me, in an ominous way, \"How ARE you!???!\" Huh? I'm fine! How are YOU? I completely accept what they're doing and understand it, but I find it slightly annoying. And I almost wish I'd never told them. I think it's hard to know how to react. There was a woman on the boards a few weeks ago who wanted to develop a line of Kick-Axx Cancer Cards. Some people liked the idea, others were horrified. She had chosen one way to react that IMO would work for some people but not for others. It's absolutely reasonable to be disappointed in your friends or angry with them. You're free to react to their non-reaction in any way, and if you're hurt, it's a real hurt. I don't really intend to defent them. But I think they're grappling (poorly) with something that's very hard to figure out. They're not mind-readers and they don't know what you need. It's likely that, in fear of doing the wrong thing, they do nothing. It's just hard to know how to react! ",

From what I've read it's quite rare for a complex cyst to be cancerous but the doctors like to be certain. (And I'm sure you do too!) While 20% of breast biopsies do find cancer, the percentage of breast cysts that are cancerous is much, much lower. I've seen reports that only .3% of complex cysts are found to be cancerous. So basically your doctor is just using an abundance of caution, which is good. But the odds that you have cancer are almost nonexistent. ",

One is Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI), which is also referred to by the name of the device used -- Mammosite, Savi, and Contura are the most common. With PBI, you have a lumpectomy and a temporary balloon-like catheter is put into your breast. For 5 days after the surgery you get radiation via the catheter twice a day -- ten doses.  The other option you weren't told about is Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT). With IORT, which is what I had, the catheter is placed inside the tumor cavity during surgery and a single dose of radiation is delivered right at the tumor site immediately. Then the catheter is removed, the wound is closed, and you're done. IORT is the greatest thing ever for DCIS patients, but the disadvantage to it is that it isn't available everywhere and you'd probably have to change doctors to get it. You can get it at Mass General in Boston.  www.massgeneral.org/radiationo...  www.breastcanceriort.org/  Some doctors will tell you that these procedures are \"experimental\" or other derogatory things, but the truth is that doctors don't make as much money doing these types of radiation and that's why they don't like it. If you don't like the options you were given, check out these other two. I don't think you'll be sorry. Long story, but I fought like the dickens to be able to get IORT and it was so worth it! ",

My surgeon is planning a lumpectomy with probable radiation (either partial breast using Mammosite or Savi or the like) or IORT (intraoperative radiation therapy). I am concerned about potential fibrosis. Over the summer I had foot surgery and physical therapy following it. One of the thing the therapist did was to perform vigorous massage around the surgical area each time I went in, as he explained it, to break up adhesions. I saw the therapist yesterday and spoke to him about my upcoming procedure and the potential for fibrosis. He's a jock type of guy in his 50s and while he's great for my feet he said he didn't have any experience in this area and doesn't seem to want to acquire any. :) However, he said he thought the type of massage he had done on my foot would almost certainly work elsewhere on the body and that after I had surgery I might want to look into it. Anyone have any experience with massage therapy after breast surgery, either for the surgery alone or for radiation-induced fibrosis?  I am an Uppity Woman. Don't like my posts? Put me on IGNORE.

As far as \"how worried should we be,\" I'd say you shouldn't be too worried. However, I agree that you should get one or two more opinions until the various issues can be reconciled. When I am doing a math problem, I often do it a couple of times to make sure the answer is the same each time. If I get different answers, I do it again until I get the same answer multiple times. I think you should treat this the same way. However, I think it's entirely possible and even likely that there's nothing to be concerned about. Do NOT get ahead of yourselves.

But the medical system in the UK is different, as many of us here know, and you don't have some of the choices we have. (OTOH you probably don't have to worry about losing your home and your life savings due to medical expenses....) MRI is a pretty common part of the diagnostic process in the US but may not be elsewhere. MRI can be very useful but it can also show a lot of false positives. One of my doctors told me recently that she thinks breast MRIs are sort of a scam, and while I don't think too many doctors would agree with her I can see her point. As I understand it, the purpose of a breast MRI is to see if there are additional lesions beyond the ones found with other methods (mammogram, ultrasound). But as I said, MRI tends to find benign lesions, which apparently leads to biopsies of normal tissue and a lot of expense and worry for patients. So, in the UK, where medical costs are more controlled, maybe it's just not used much.  You might want to start another topic with something about the UK in the title of the post if you want to get input from other ladies in the UK. About \"removing the lump for biopsy.\" Some surgeons do what's called an excisional biopsy, which is basically the same as a lumpectomy. It's not uncommon. Most biopsies are just a sample of the tissue, but for one reason or another sometimes the entire lump is removed. I don't know the logic of doing one versus the other, but perhaps someone else will chime in and explain that. After the excisional biopsy the tissue will be sent for pathological examination to find out what it is. But the doctor may have an idea, once he sees the tissue, of what's going on. Pathology will give him the final answer but sometimes the appearance tells a lot. When you have the biopsy you might want to ask how and when you will receive the pathology results. It's easier to wait when you know how long the wait will be. ",

Check out the chart below -- you had the screening mammo and were one of the 10% called back for a diagnostic workup. After that you became one of the 25% called back for a biopsy.  According to the chart below your biopsy has a 25% chance of coming back with a cancer diagnosis. To be honest, from what you report the doctors having said, I'd give you a slightly higher number. However -- and here's the important part -- not all cancer diagnoses are created equal. Once you get that diagnosis (if you get it) there are degrees of seriousness and treatability. Again, from what you describe, the cancer you're most likely to have (again, if you have cancer) is DCIS. DCIS is a very early, very treatable breast cancer. It's often treated with a lumpectomy and radiation only, no chemo.   It's natural to worry about a biopsy. But do understand that even if you do have BC, it's quite unlikely you have a serious or advanced cancer. You're not on the Titanic! And don't worry TOO much.  ",

I've never received any training in radiology and when the doctors show me my images I just nod because it always looks to me like chocolate pudding. However, I've been reading the posts here for about a year and from what I've seen here, yes, there are situations in which the mammogram or ultrasound do tell the tale. Believe me, doctors and technicians don't go around telling women they've got BC unless they're pretty damn sure. The majority of women who are getting diagnostic mammos are scared half to death, and if doctors said things to scare these women unnecessarily, it would be ugly! In fact, I think doctors generally try to be as optimistic as possible, and give hope even when there's not much reason to hope. So if your doctor is not giving you any reason to hope, well, I'd say you have your answer right there. That's my honest, but regretful, opinion.  ",

The ALND is therapeutic: nodes that are cancerous, or are believed to be cancerous, are removed as part of the breast cancer treatment. There's some controversy associated with ALND. While it was a standard treatment until pretty recently, some studies last year said that it wasn't worthwhile.

I understand the financial issue, but as far as a 10 day vacation goes, having a lumpectomy and SNB is not a big deal for most women. (There are, of course, exceptions.) If you're not going to do anything really strenuous on your vacation, you could probably pretty easily start your vacation a few days after your lumpectomy. My sense is that since your surgeon \"reluctantly agreed\" to the postponement, there's some reason not to postpone. I have often seen women on these boards beating themselves up merely for having delayed their regular mammo by a few months. It seems to me that it's rather riskier to be delaying surgery when there's a chance of invasion. ",

They don't do that so they just get very, very frightened.  2) You talked about a biopsy of the sentinel node, and while \"sentinel node biopsy\" is generally a surgical procedure in which one or more entire nodes are removed, I think they can also take out a little sample. Maybe that's what your doctor is planning to do. You can ask about this -- call the office and ask whether the SNB will be a surgical biopsy of entire nodes, or if a piece of a node is going to be taken out. (The reason to ask this is mostly related to pain and recovery. A breast biopsy is not a big deal, but the surgical removal of lymph nodes is a rather bigger deal with more recovery needed.) 3) It sounds to me that your doctor has seen something in the mammo that makes it quite clear to him that you have BC. From what I've seen on these boards, it's pretty apparent to me that certain things in the imaging can cause a doctor to say, with about 98% accuracy, that a patient has BC. I think you should assume that the doctor is correct in his assumption.  4) I think it's time for your relatives to step up to the plate and come to be with your sister. Your doctor is silently screaming that you have a serious medical condition that needs to be taken care of. They need to step up so you can step DOWN. Really.  As I said above, it's no good if your sister's battle is won, only for yours to be lost. You seem like a mentally healthy and clear-headed woman, but it is not mentally healthy to be caring for your sister as you neglect your own health. Let your other relatives know that you have to stop caring for your sister now and that they must step up. ",

BTW, a while back I found this little series of animations about an axillary lymph node dissection. Please note that SNB and ALND are not exactly the same procedure -- in an SNB only about 3 nodes are removed, while in an ALND they take out all the nodes in the area. But I think the principles are essentially the same. http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/ALND/ALND_content/axillaryAnatomy.html \"I believe the biopsy is being done by the radiologist.\" Yes, that's the usual case. BTW, I usually recommend to women that they ask, when the biopsy is done, how and when the results will be available. In your case you already know a little about the results, but more info will be available from the biopsy. Some docs will phone you with the results, others want to see you in the office. Some women get their results in about 48 hours, some must wait much longer.  \"I've been told breast cancer will change my life, and I'm not sure exactly how, other than the treatment.\" It depends on many things. Lots of things change one's life. Even losing or gaining a few pounds can change your life. Part of the magnitude of the change comes from your attitude toward your situation, but part comes from the treatment, how major it is, how you respond to it, and what long-term effects it has. There's definitely a \"new normal\" after BC treatment, but that new normal may be a big change or it may be a small one. It may be hard to adapt to, or it may be an easy change.",

Second, lumps that feel immobile to us are often classified as mobile by doctors.  Third, women get lots of lumpy things in their breasts, and it's pretty rare for any of them to be cancer. Fourth, I don't ever recall seeing anyone say that chest pain or fatigue were symptoms of BC. Whatever's causing that is almost certainly something else.

As you'll see, 25% of those who get the workup are sent for a biopsy, and of those only 20% are diagnosed with cancer.  So your odds of having cancer are really very low.

So if you do have cancer and if it's DCIS (the second is more probable than the first), you've got time. DCIS is not an emergency. You should get it treated \"promptly\" but chances are your surgeon won't even bat an eye at a business trip three weeks hence. DCIS is usually treated with surgery and radiation alone, no chemo.  I totally get the \"distraction--\" at the grocery store the checker asks \"paper or plastic?\" and you want to scream \"What effin' difference does it make?\" I'll tell you a little secret.

Birads was developed as a way for radiologists to communicate their mammo findings in a uniform and standard way so that when records went from doctor to doctor and from hospital to hospital, everyone looking at the findings could understand them. Birads was never intended to predict cancer. When you get a mammo, what they're trying to \"prove\" is that you don't have cancer or anything else of concern. When the Birads score is high, the radiologist is saying, \"What I've seen on the mammo makes it impossible for me to rule out cancer (or another condition of concern).\"  Therefore, when you get a high Birads score (generally meaning a 4 or 5) the next step is to perform one or more other procedures that could rule out cancer, such as a biopsy.  So don't get too excited about the Birads score -- it's really a tool for communication between doctors and a higher number just means more tests are needed. If no one has contacted you to schedule additional testing, be sure you do so yourself! You've done the first part -- you've apparently had your annual mammo -- but your job isn't done. Make sure the followup testing is done soon. And let us know what happens! ",

Clearly it's not convenient but neither is 6-7 weeks of WBI. And the Birmingham trip would be quick since the procedure is outpatient.  The reason IORT is not popular in this country is that the ROs don't make as much money doing it as they make from PBI or especially WBI. It's much more popular in Europe where cost containment is important. It's much less expensive to have IORT than PBI or WBI. Eventually I think the US will figure out that IORT is a better use of our healthcare dollars.",

And I have NEVER before said that to someone on BCO. I went back and read what the other poster wrote and while I think what she said was rather confusing and awkward, she did NOT say what you think she said. Your anxiety is causing you to read a meaning that just wasn't there.  I think what she meant to say -- or at least what she OUGHT to have said -- is that while anything is possible, it's very unlikely that a woman your age would be diagnosed with breast cancer.   Other than what leaf wrote above, I couldn't find stats on the odds of getting BC at your age, but for ages 30-39, the odds are 1 in 233. The odds of getting hit by space debris are 1 in 3200, so while BC is more likely as you can see the odds are against it! Marie, the woman who gave you the advice that made you feel better, is one of the wisest people on BCO and her advice is excellent. Leaf is another really wise one.  Relax. Really.

I'm inclined to feel that a specialist who doesn't have a dog in the fight is going to give a more balanced opinion. On the lighter side -- yesterday I saw my GP and we were talking about specialists. He's a very witty fellow, and with a twinkle in his eye he said to me, \"We actually like to call them 'partialists.'\" Amusing, but sometimes true. The specialists sometimes get so focused on the trees that they don't see the forest. ",

As you may have already discovered, 90% of instances of nipple discharge are due to something other than cancer. So while it's not impossible that you have some sort of cancer, it's not terribly likely.  The thing I keep coming back to is the odor of the discharge, which makes me think of infection. Infections are often extremely malodorous, especially when the infection has no where to go.  Your aunt thinks Augmentin would have cleared up any breast infection, but that doesn't seem correct to me. Augmentin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but as we know many bacteria these days have become antibiotic resistant. If you have a breast infection, there's no reason to think it's not resistant to Augmentin. And as shelley said above, it could be something like MRSA, which can't be treated with Augmentin.  Here's an article about Mammary Duct Ectasia. Here's an article about Periductal Mastitis.  If you look at this page, it indicates that a discharge that's sticky and purulent is generally not cancer.   That being said, even if it's not cancer doesn't mean it's not serious. If you really can't go to a doc until 2012, call tomorrow and get an appointment for the earliest day and time available in 2012.",

Now, many women use hormonal birth control for years, even decades, and never get breast cancer. So hormone exposure doesn't cause cancer per se -- it just increases the statistical risk over your lifetime. 2) Women, particularly those exposed to hormones, get lots of lumpy bumpy things in their breasts that are not cancer. These things should always be checked out, but most of them are not cancer.  3) Note that while hormones increase lifetime risk, they increase risk of non-cancerous lumpy-bumpies while they're being taken.  4) Lumps that feel non-mobile to the layperson are often classified as mobile by a medical professional. 5) While you're not too young to have breast cancer, your age is in your favor. It's pretty rare to get BC in your twenties. IMO you should definitely follow up on the recommended tests and such, but the odds are very much on your side. ",

I think the answer depends on whether there's a physical component to your work.  I'll assume, though, that you have a desk job with no physical component. In my personal experience, the thing that requires the most recovery time is the Sentinel Node Biopsy. There's some discomfort involved with that, for a while, and the use of that arm is somewhat limited for a few weeks.  I didn't find the lumpectomy itself to be particularly problematic, certainly less so than the SNB. As far as the IORT radiation, it does cause some fatigue for 3 1/2 or 4 weeks. You might want to try to leave work early for a few weeks if you can. If you can't, plan to take it VERY easy when you get home in the evening. Let someone else do the grocery shopping, meal preparation, etc. I don't work, but I believe I could have worked soon after my lumpectomy/SNB/IORT. But I know I would have been very wiped out when I came home and would have wanted someone to bring me dinner so I could eat and go straight to bed. ",

In order to decide if the mass is suspicious enough to require further testing, your radiologist will look at the edges of the mass, called the margins. If the margins are smooth and the mass is round or oval, it is most likely benign (not cancer). If the edges are irregular, then it is possibly cancer and a biopsy is necessary to determine if cancer cells are present.\" I wasn't able to find a clear explanation of the meaning of findings of heterogeneity.

Here's what a posted there:  One of my issues early on was uneasiness about disfigurement. I had foot surgery about 5 months before my diagnosis, and the result was that my \"great\" toe on one foot is a little shorter than the one on the other foot. I've always thought my feet were very nicely shaped and am pretty vain about them. I was still mourning the length of the toe when I got my BC diagnosis. Needless to say, the toe issue kinda went out of my mind. However, I'm pleased to tell you, and anyone else who will listen, that I've had no disfigurement whatsoever. 8 months after surgery I still have a visible scar on the side of my breast, but the size and shape are so little changed as to be unnoticable. I'm sure that's not the case for every woman, but my point is that BC surgery isn't necessarily at all disfiguring. Even for people who are bothered by having one big toe that's shorter than the other.  ",

If you're a candidate for one you *should* be a candidate for the other. The reason I almost had it was that the IORT machine used by my doctor was not certified until the day after my lumpectomy. Therefore, I had the temporary balloon placed in my breast and was going to have SAVI but the doctor called and said the machine had been certified, so she removed the balloon and I had IORT instead. One of the biggest advantages to internal radiation, either IORT or SAVI/Mammosite/whatever is that you won't get burning on your skin. If you check out some of the threads here you'll find this was very bad for some women. Another big advantage is the reduced treatment time. I found the balloon very uncomfortable while it was in my breast, and I was unable to sleep much while it was in. However, I still would have chosen it over whole breast radiation. WBI scares me.  I urge you to check out IORT -- look at www.breastcanceriort.org/ and other sites -- and see what you think. IORT is not available in some states but if it's available near you, try to get it! You won't be sorry.",

My pre-surgical diagnosis was the same as yours. My understanding is that if I get a recurrence it's most likely to be DCIS again rather than invasive cancer, and I just couldn't see subjecting myself to the risks of WBI in order to lower my risk of another DCIS. And you know, it's not just possible damage to heart and lungs -- there are also women who get Shingles, squamous cell carcinomas, broken ribs, and few other nasty side effects. I'm so glad I was able to avoid all that! I know you're in surgery today but I hope you come back and tell us all how it went! ",

Though I think it's not particularly obvious, the main boards here at BCO are for those who are taking a fairly traditional treatment route. There are two areas reserved for those pursuing less traditional routes -- the \"Complementary and Holistic Medicine and Treatment\" area and the \"Alternative Medicine\" area. As far as I can tell, the areas are separate because there's regularly been some friction between those pursuing traditional treatments versus those going with less traditional ones. With respect, I have to say I think you're on the edge of experiencing some of that friction. I wonder whether you might get a better reception for your views, and meet more people who think like you do, if you were to post in those other areas rather than here in the main areas of BCO.",

As far as I can see, you don't meet those conditions. Here's my opinion: you need to stop thinking about breast cancer and start thinking about pain. Just because something is in your breast doesn't mean it's cancer. If the pain was in your toe, would you assume cancer? I don't think so. If I were you I would try to find a chronic pain specialist and see whether you can get any pain relief from him/her. Many people find that accupuncture is helpful with pain, though I haven't tried it myself.

However, someone above said something like \"there's no way this will fly with a new employer\" and I must respectfully disagree. I have interviewed prospective employees for whom I would have cut off my left arm to get them to take a job because they were my \"dream employee.\" If you decide your medical issues will affect your work, you need to give the prospective employer the opportunity to decide whether you're \"worth it.\" You sound to me like a very motivated and conscientious employee, and I think you might have been one of those people for whom I would have cut off a limb. Consider telling them the whole story and let them decide. Let them know how much *you* want to work for *them.* You may be able to come to some kind of agreement that will make everyone happy.  Recently I saw a Dilbert cartoon that I should have saved. The pointy haired boss is interviewing a really rude guy. He decides to hire him, saying, \"You must have awesome technical skills or else someone would have killed you by now.\" If you are one of those people with such awesome technical skills, an employer will put up with a LOT to nab you! ",

But if you fit that description I strongly urge you to look into it.  IORT is a breeze. The radiation is done *during* surgery so you are finished with everything in a single procedure. Trials have shown it to be as effective as partial breast irradiation. In general, surgeons who don't recommend it do so because they don't have access to it.

The surgeon (who should be willing to give you a copy of the pathology report from your biopsy) will, based on the pathology report, be able to make an educated guess about the size of the total tumor and the stage. It seems as though the surgeon's guess is correct most of the time but occasionally it's not. Based on that educated guess, and possibly some additional tests such as an MRI, the surgeon will recommend a course of action or a couple of different plans from which you might choose.  For example, in many cases a lumpectomy (usually with radiation) is sufficient. Sometimes a mastectomy is recommended, with or without radiation. Chemotherapy may also be \"on the menu.\" My suggestion is this: if you can, take someone along with you to meet the surgeon and ask the other person to take notes. Sometimes one's head is spinning and it's difficult to absorb everything that's said. If that's not possible, try to jot down some notes yourself. The doc will probably draw some pictures and write a few things down but it's a good idea to do some of your own writing. Then when you get home, use your notes (and/or your friend's) and write down everything you remember. If you have questions about something, BCO is a good place to ask them.  ",

As I understand it, the mammo and the U/S are capable of seeing different things. Sometimes something that shows up on the mammo doesn't show on the U/S, and vice-versa.  MRIs find all sorts of things and are notorious for \"false positives.\" Recently my obgyn, who's about 60 and has been at this for many years, told me she has never had a patient for which something relevant was found on an MRI that hadn't been seen on mammo or U/S. She actually counsels her patients against having breast MRIs. However, there have been women on this forum whose BC was only found by MRI, so obviously it does help some percentage of women. Regarding biopsies: to the best of my knowledge (which may be incorrect), biopsies are guided either by mammo, U/S, or MRI. Mine was mammo-guided. It seems to me, guineamom, if one of the lesions visible on the mammo was not visible on the U/S, then a mammo ought to have been used to guide the biopsy. Assuming that you do indeed have dense breasts, as the radiologist said, this does apparently present a particular problem in radiology. For example, I do not have dense breasts, and the areas of concern show up very nicely, as whiter areas, on my mammos and U/Ss. Apparently if one has dense breasts everything looks white. Therefore the areas of concern are harder to identify. As I say, however, it seems to me that if they can see an area of concern via imaging method \"A\" but not via imaging method \"B,\" they ought to use method A to do the biopsy. Do be aware that having MRIs is not without health risks. The MRI itself is harmless, but generally a contrast medium is delivered intravenously during the MRI, and there are some risks associated with the use of the contrast medium. Most people who have a handful of MRIs with contrast during their lives will be just fine, but it's not the sort of thing one ought to go through every day.  ",

The most important of those reasons is this: tissue that is under surgical manipulation has a rich vascularization, which makes it more sensitive to the action of the radiation. Brachytherapy doesn't have that same benefit.  Another important difference is that with IORT, the radiation is delivered to the cavity before any stray tumor cells have a chance to get out and spread. As Jelson says above, comparing IORT to brachytheraphy is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course the decision is yours, but IMO you won't regret it. My surgery with IORT was 11 months ago and I'm still thankful I was able to have it. ",

It sounds to me as though the study was quite poorly designed. The main points in the article were: 1. The study is flawed in that: a) The data did not report cancer-recurrence rates. b) The study states that mastectomy rates equate to recurrence rates, which is not true. c) The reported complication rates are unrealistically high and differ dramatically from better-done studies in scientific literature. 2. Patients now have access to newer and better forms of APBI that have been developed since the Medicare data was created. The MDA study was based on Medicare billing claims for more than 130,000 patients over the age of 66 who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer between 2000 and 2007 and received a lumpectomy and radiation. Researchers observed an increase of 1.8 percent in the rate of mastectomies among women who received breast brachytherapy. The older, \"balloon\" form of brachytherapy covered by the data was also associated with somewhat higher toxicity and complication rates. \"Among several shortcomings of the San Antonio study data,\" said Dr. Kuske, is the fact that it covers \"an antiquated balloon catheter with a single channel. Since that time, technology has dramatically improved to encompass the use of newer, multichannel applicators. The side effects and toxicity seen with these modern technological advances are far less than the results presented in the study.\"  The three major medical societies involved in the research and use of APBI have also issued statements of concern about the study conclusions. ",

Toward the end of the radiation you might want to be able to take some days or half days off.  Some women here have had lumpectomy and SNB on a Wednesday, Thursday, or even Friday and gone back to work on Monday. Is there an elevator in your building?  If not, PLEASE advise your doctors of this. I didn't have whole breast radiation, so I'm only going on what I've been told, but based on that I suspect it will be extremely difficult to climb 3 flights during radiation -- even if you only have to do it once a day.",

In Europe, though, it's one of the preferred ways to treat breast cancer.

It wouldn't surprise me too much if the surgeon thinks it's ok to leave it. Surgery carries risks, and there are greater risks for older people and those with other health problems. That being said, a lumpectomy is really fairly minor surgery if no lymph nodes are being removed. So if she does have the surgery done, your sister and she may find that it's really not a big deal. Many women sail right through it, though of course most are many years younger.  Lumpectomies are usually done under general anesthesia, but on the BCO boards we often hear from a woman who had hers under local anesthetic and some sort of \"light general\" or \"twilight sleep\" such as Versed. Be sure your sister asks the surgeon about this. ",

Seromas can happen with any type of breast surgery, whether or not there's radiation, but develop somewhat more commonly with Mammosite-type radiation.

The large tumor  has good estrogen receptors and fairly good progestone receptors. You didn't give the estrogen Allred score for the small invasive tumor but its progestone receptors are the same as that of the DCIS. Here's what it means: you have a fairly garden-variety, non-invasive tumor called DCIS. As you already know, the docs want to remove it, and the small invasive tumor, with surgery.  If a mastectomy is done, there may be no need for radiation. Because the small tumor is invasive, the doc will want to do more tests. It's possible, though not terribly likely, that some chemotherapy will be suggested. Probably an estrogen suppressing medication will be prescribed, such as Tamoxifen. As I said, this is a pretty garden-variety early tumor and pretty easily treatable. It's something that needs to be taken care of, but it's not something particularly dangerous as long as the treatments are completed. Here's what you need to understand: You're not on the Titanic. You're not circling the drain. Although you have breast cancer, you are not Elizabeth Edwards. You have something quite treatable, and she did not. About the pain you have: You're going through something that's traumatic to you, as it should be. The reason you still have pain is almost certainly because of the anguish you're feeling. Please take care of yourself, as you are going to need some mental and physical strength to get through surgery and recovery. When I was diagnosed, my BS gave me info about support groups I could join and places I could go if I felt I needed talk therapy. Have any of the doctors provided any such info to you? They really ought to. On Monday, call whichever doctor you've been dealing with and tell them you need help dealing with the emotional aspects of your diagnosis. Don't try to tough it out and don't ignore the signals your body is giving you. Sometimes when your mind is in pain it inflicts pain on your body, and that's almost certainly what's causing you to feel pain from your biopsy. Please do take care of yourself.   ",

There are several, though the medical literature refers to \"the first SLN\" and \"the second SLN\" and so forth. A study a few years ago showed that the optimal number of nodes to remove is two. When only one is harvested, only 87.9% of nodal invasions are found. When two are harvested, 97% are found. The third raises the number to nearly 100%. If you've been reading BCO for a while, you may have seen that on very rare occasions the surgeon finds no invasion in any sentinel node but the cancer is later found to have metastasized. Somehow it got past the first couple of nodes undetected and into the lymphatic system. However, as I say this is apparently quite rare.",

Let's say you have a tumor that's exactly 1 cm and perfectly round, and it's right in the middle of a round area that's ADH. The tumor and the ADH together measure a total of 3 cm.  So let's say they take both out and there's a margin of only 1 mm. They got all the tumor plus 1.1 cm of tissue with no tumor, but they only got 1 mm of non-ADH tissue. So what are the margins? 1.1 cm or 1 mm?",

Usually this means it's known that the cancer is in the nodes, but it doesn't sound as though you've had any nodes removed yet.   there's considerable evidence, relatively new, that ALND doesn't have any benefit (but I believe this may be applicable primarly for earlier stages than IIIc). Please read this Medscape article, this ASCO article, and this JAMA article. There is, however, as you've seen in the comments above, significant risk of complications. As the ASCO article indicates, a sentinel node biopsy should be done to determine if nodes are affected, and how many are affected. If the number is high, ALND could be done later. I see you're in Oceanside -- you might want to contact user Gabbycal, who I think is in Carlsbad. She went through a couple of doctors before settling on one she really liked. ",

But if a researcher thinks it's going to make a difference in getting someone to take a pill that makes her ill, well, then.... Well, I'm not going to say what I think should happen to that researcher but believe me it's not a pleasant fate. Here's the reason women are non-compliant with Tamoxifen. We're told that if we take it for 1825 days it \"might\" keep us from getting something that we \"might\" get. We don't know we'll get BC again if we don't take it. We don't know we'll be protected from BC if we do. It only reduces risk -- and in many cases the risk is already pretty small -- by half. And we have to take it for a long time to get that dubious benefit. Oh, and BTW, most women get at least some SEs, however minor, from it! But that report seems to think that telling us to use a little pill box is going to make a difference! Once again, I won't say what I really think of a person who gives such advice and will settle for the term MORONIC! If there were no SEs, women would be willing to put up with the uncertainty of whether Tamoxifen made a difference. Or if there was certainty -- if one could be guaranteed that BC wouldn't come back if one took it -- more women would put up with SEs. THAT'S the problem. It's a pure risk/reward scenario. Too much risk, too little assurance of reward. Instead of giving this problem to medical folks to analyze, it ought to be looked at by MBA candidates, who learn about this when they study asset rates of return!",

Four days after Elizabeth Edwards died of breast cancer, I found out I had it too. Fortunately, thanks to a mammogram, a non-palpable tumor was found. In a few weeks I had surgery to remove the tumor and internal radiation.  Without a mammo I wouldn't have known about this very early, very curable cancer. I ended up with a small scar on one breast (which should fade to near invisibility), no chemo, and no disfigurement. None. If you want to PM me, I'll even send you pictures to prove how minor the surgery was. The difference between me and Elizabeth Edwards is that mine was found early when only a mammo would detect it. I ended up with a small fading scar and, essentially, a cure. Hers was found late and she died. Mammos are what can give you the GOOD outcomes. No mammos has the possibility of giving you the BAD outcomes. Your friend has a choice: she can be me, or she can be Elizabeth Edwards. She should opt for the likelihood of a GOOD outcome and get the annual mammo. (Regarding concern about radiation: though you think it's bogus, she can discuss that issue with her doc ask that she get an ultrasound instead. Ultrasound is also sometimes also used as a first-line breast diagnostic tool.) ",

I think comparing them is a little like comparing pneumonia to a chest cold -- they're just not the same. Yes, both are cancer, but IMO that's where the similarity ends.  I think assisted living can be great. One of my mom's friends went to live in a 3 stage senior community -- the first stage was a condo with access to community dining and so forth, the second stage was more of an assisted living small apartment, and the third stage was skilled nursing. She went comfortably through all 3 stages and it was terrific for her.   So while a senior community is a wonderful option, I had thought you might want to get some kind of professional help with your anxiety sooner. ",

I don't know why this is, but I suspect it's because research is done using one or two protocols only, so they only have longitudinal evidence from those protocols. Doctors may suspect that something different would work just as well for certain patients, but they have no research to back up their suspicions. So they're taking a professional risk if they recommend something without research, because if it doesn't work... It's one thing for a doctor to fool around with different treatments for a sore throat, and quite another to fool around with cancer treatments.

Lots of women have cysts all the time, and they're not of any consequence. But microcalcs sometimes are.  I'm not a doctor, but if you were my daughter I'd advise you to be very sure that you get back to the doc in March for the mammo, and if the doctor doesn't want to biopsy the cluster then, I'd want to know WHY.  ",

So if you find a mammo to be painful, you might find being held in place during the stereotactic biopsy to be painful. In either case, though, you'll get a few shots of lidocaine to numb you before they take the tissue. The most painful part of that is the shot itself. I didn't find it painful -- it's described as being \"like a bee sting\" but I've been stung by bees and I think a bee sting is far worse. If they're doing a lot of biopsies there's a pretty good chance you'll be sore afterward, but with some Advil or Motrin or the like, and an ice pack, you'll be fine.  ",

This one sounds a little nutty, to be honest.  You say you \"want whatever it is out since it should not be there in the first place.\" That's not really true. As we age we naturally get all kinds of little doodads in our breasts and elsewhere. Some of it is normal and isn't bothering anything so there's no reason to take it out. ",

However, as Susie says an excisional biopsy may be under consideration, but I don't understand how that could be something being considered at this point in time. Mother of twins, what kind of doc was your \"breast specialist?\" All other things being equal I think I'd prefer seeing a breast surgeon rather than a general surgeon. But all other things are never equal! ",

One reason is what kind of equipment a particular doctor has and what his or her expertise is. But there are more important reasons. If a lesion is visible on mammo but not on ultrasound, then of course the biopsy must be done during a mammo. And the reverse is also true. Furthermore, there are some lesions that aren't easily reached -- a lesion very near the chest wall may be more difficult to biopsy with one method than with another. ",
