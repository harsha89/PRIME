I think the fibrocystic changes that showed up on my mammo may have just side-tracked everyone from the original question of IBC.  I will ask for the skin punch biopsy on Monday, hopefully my doctor will agree, or if not agree, then have another answer for me.",

      "Content": "Adri wrote: About a year or more ago my left breast started to itch. I got steadily worse and I kept meaning to make an appointment with my pcp and ask him about it, but I just didn't get to it.  I have other medical problems (spinal injuries, PTSD, head injury, and a severe latex allergy) that take up so much of my life that I just dread going to the doctor any more than I absolutely have to. When I had my kids (11 and 13 years ago) I had chronic mastitis while I was breastfeeding them both.  About two weeks ago I woke up with a very angry red spot on my left breast and a fever, just like the good ol' days.  It got worse all day, I developed a couple more red spots, and then that night my whole breast became swollen and red.  My husband and I decided that I needed to go to the doctor the next morning.  I was so sick that he decided to make the appointment for me.  He was told that my regular pcp could not see me for a week, so he got mad and made an appointment with a doctor in a different office.  By the time I was getting ready for that appointment my breast was already looking much better, but I went in anyway.  The doctor looked at my breast but did not do a breast exam.  She wrote me a Rx for an antibiotic, then told me if it did not get better in a couple of days I might have IBC and I should get a mammogram to find out. I had a bad feeling about her, and about the appointment overall, so I decided I would get the mammogram regardless.  Better safe than sorry, right?  It turns out she wrote the mammogram script wrong (screening rather than diagnostic), it took two weeks of phone calls back and forth between the imaging place, myself, and the doctor's office to get the correct order sent in and the mammogram scheduled.  Meanwhile I decided to follow up with my regular pcp so that he would be in the loop so that I could have my results sent to him.  I wasn't really in the mood to deal with the other doctor again, ever.  I saw him last Monday, he was concerned that I never completely stopped producing milk when I should have ten years ago so he had bloodwork done to test for a benign pituitary tumor, but also wanted me to go ahead with the mammogram and ultrasound.  Thursday I had one set of mammo pics done, then waited while a doctor looked at them, then a second set, more waiting, then an ultrasound, more waiting, then the doctor came in to tell me there was a \"questionable area\" that I needed to have biopsied asap.  The whoel process took over two hours.  We kept watching other women come in, get their tests, and leave so we were really wondering what the big deal with mine was.  They scheduled me to come in the next day for an image-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy and then another mammogram. I got to see the \"questionable area\" that they tested and then they told me that there were some other microcalcifications behind my nipple that I may need to have biopsied next (depending on the results of this one). I'm home now all taped up and bruised and trying to get through the weekend, waiting until Monday when they will call me with the results. I am more or less ok no matter whatever the outcome is.  It is just one more thing to deal with, and we will, like we always do.  My kids know what is going on and seem to be handling it fine so far.  My daughter said we should have a party if it turns out to not be cancer, then she said we should go ahead and have the party if it is cancer too.  My son has been giving me extra hugs.  I got myself through the weekend so far, and through my son's birthday party today, but now I find myself suddenly feeling a bit down.  I've had to stop myself from crying twice now.  I just really don't want to fall apart right now when I don't even know what the results are.  I don't know if I want the time to fly by or crawl by until that phone call tomorrow.  Sorry for the epic long post.  I'm just scared, and talking to my family about it constantly is only upsetting them more, possibly needlessly.  Log in to post a reply",
