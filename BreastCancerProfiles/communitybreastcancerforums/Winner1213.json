Mammogram came back on 10/4 with an area of concern. Scheduled ultrasound.  Went there on the 10th.  Tech took TONS and TONS of pics.  Radiologist reviewed them and requested MORE pictures.  We did that, and he reviewed those, THEN asked for another Mammogram.  Did that.  Review.  Consult.  One mass at about 8:00 left breast.  2 cm.  irregular shape, second mass at 3:00, similar characteristics only 1 cm.  I received the radiology report today, it stated, \"suspected malignancy\"  Biopsies on both are scheduled for Monday.   I hate waiting more than anything.  :-(  Thank you for listening, and any kind or encouraging words would help too.  Log in to post a reply",

The waiting is PURE torture, and should be entirely illegal.  My experience with Biopsy results was 4 business days.  The Dr. told us there was a 4%  (FOUR %!) chance these tumors would be benign.  There were three of them, four days later,  ALL three benign.  I am so sorry you are experiencing the pain of the wait.  I hope you will take some solace in my experience/results.
