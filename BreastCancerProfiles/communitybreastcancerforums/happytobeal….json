I have breast implants and I'm worried about the radiation treatments that will follow my next surgery. I had two Aunts die in their 40's years ago. That brings up the concern for the gene testing.  My doctor is bringing my case up in her weekly meeting with the other doctors this week in what to do. I've been reading about the Pet Scan and I'm not real happy with what I've been reading. It doesn't seem really that accurate. I can't believe how many of us that our out there. Good luck to everyone. I mean that with all my heart even though I don't know you. Thanks again for all of you that replied.  Angela. Keep smiling ladies",

I'm having more margin taken out this friday and some lymphnodes checked and then I'm off to the races with my date with radiation. I'm more concerned in having my lymphnodes removed. They're only taking 3 right now. I have breast implants now and I'm really scared what the radiation is going to do to the left breast. If I could have found a geneticist to take medicaid I would have had the gene test done and would have based my decision on what kind of operation would have  been best for me. I can only hope that I don't have the gene with having 2 aunts die of bc in their 40's. I'm only 46 as it is. oh well, We'll get through all of this. Huggggggggggggggggggggs to all. Angela",

I've been doing a lot of reading and I had a lumpectomy and will be following up with radiation. From what I've read from creditable sources is that it's just as affective as having both breast removed. Once they're gone they're gone but reconstructive surgery is also an option. I can't say I would have ruled it out if I had children. I wish you the very best. Talk to the women on this site. I'm just a newbie and like I said I don't have any children. Take each day one day at a time. I've slowed it down a bit myself. When I start projecting I catch it fast and I say to myself. NO! Stay in the day! That old saying rings true. \"Today is a gift, that's why it's called the Present\" Take a deep breath, stop and smell the roses today, tomorrow and all the days after.  Hugggggggggggggggggggggggggs Angela",
