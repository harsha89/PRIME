What questions should we be prepared to ask the surgeon?  My list so far:  - stage & # of lymph nodes involved? - extent of lymph node involvement (micro?  macro? extra-capsular) - likelihood of needing rads?  - margins (she had a skin saving mastectomy) We will also get the results of her mammaprint test.  Is there anything else we should ask about?  We meet with an oncologist on 11/3 to determine next steps. Thanks in advance.",
