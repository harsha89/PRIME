I think I got off to a bad start all together. Beacuse of my chest cold & all I had a hard time. Just glad I'm out of the hospital, they were all great though! & I was too sick to care about anything for awhile. WaveWhisper, I also got the red cheeks, family likes them, they make me look healthy! LOL Hope its a good day for all! Madeline",

I tried to go out for a short walk with my daughter. I didnt last long, i got shortness of breath & chest pain, with a racing heart. Did call the Drs & figured out that it was pain in the sternum not the heart. But I have to keep an eye on it. Feel a little better today/ As they say...1 day at a time. Madeline",

Startied chemo on Jan 13 20111 with Adriamycin, Cytoxan total of 4 treatments every 3 weeks, then Taxol every week for 12 weeks. My 1st treatment was hell. I got thrush then a cough ended up in the hospital for a week for being neutropenic. 6 days later getting my next treatment with a booster shot of neutropen to raise my white blood count. The shot has given me a few side effects. Has anyone else received this? Thanks for listening. Hope everyone is doing ok. Madeline",

I would like to know how long it takes for the Taxol infusion? Also, for those that are going to, or have had both AC & TX which one do you think has the worst side effects? Thank you, Madeline",
