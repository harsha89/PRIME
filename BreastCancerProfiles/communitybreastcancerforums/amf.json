I totally get how stressful (and anxiety inducing) a lump can be.  I don't know whether you need medical help for your anxiety or not - i'm not a psychiatrist.   I do, however, know this: you can tell your doctor what you want and ask them to provide it for you.  Most doctors will follow your wishes and if they don't you should find a new doctor. If you are still not convinced that you do not have breast cancer, here are a few of things you can do to ease your mind: 1. Get a Breast Specialist 2. Demand an MRI   3. Get a Thermogram I don't believe you have had either of these diagnostic tests yet (MRI, Thermogram)?  Go out there and get them! If you have to pay for it, you have to pay for it.  Peace of mind is priceless.",

This week, my new breast specialist did an ultrasound and said it was likely just dense tissue, but she couldn't guarantee it wasn't cancer.  So she did a fine needle biopsy guided by ultrasound.  It was virtually painless. I wish I could say the same about waiting for the results!",
