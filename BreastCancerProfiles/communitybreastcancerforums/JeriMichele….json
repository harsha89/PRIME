I went to the health food store and purchased Pharma GABA that is a Stress-Relax pleasant chewable tablet that allowed me to relax and have mental focus (not the negative variety) and it honestly helped. Attitude is everything for me. I have no connection with Pharma Gaba or anything else in the health food store, but this provided what I needed without doing damage. Lymph nodes can be aggravated by a number of things that have nothing to do with your breast/s. Mine got very angry at the biopsy and I also had a sebaceous cyst removed from my back that made 'em mad too. That sentinel node is called that for a reason, that little sentinel guard protects/fights against metastasis of cancer and other infections to keep it from sneaking past it and into the other parts of the body. So prayerfully you have good surgeons/diagnosticians. My thoughts are with you and if I can be of assistance in any way, let us know. Us women are tough and frankly, since my bi-lateral mastectomy (with very, very minimal pain) I feel better than I have felt in a long, long time. It has been 8 days and I'm back at work. I could have came back 2 days ago, but decided that I was going to do some fun things for me (I take care of my 84 year old Mom) and just went around and looked in stores, Goodwill, bonded with my 4 daughters and while I know you're scared, there is wonderful life out there.",
