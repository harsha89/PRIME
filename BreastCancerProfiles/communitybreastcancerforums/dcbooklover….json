Got my port this past Monday, and I start my chemo on Jan 25 (4 sessions of A/C every other week and then 12 weeks of Taxol). I am thinking I may just go get my hair cut really short next week to get ready for the hair loss. And I have to get all the items on the chemo list (not as much fun as other shopping trips I've had). I'm having my chemo before surgery and radiation, so this is my first stop on the bc treatment train. thanks for all your posts and good cheer -- glad we're in this together. XOXO, Diane Dx 12/27/2017, IDC, Right Breast and 1 node, ER+/PR+, HER2-",
