I wanted to get myself checked out and to my surprise they found a mass that looked suspicious on my ultrasound and I was referred to my mom's surgeon at the hospital. After doing a bunch of tests at the hospital they were pretty sure that the mass was a Fibroadenoma but to be 100% sure they wanted to biopsy it. I was a wreck for a week (even though they didn't think I had anything to worry about). My results turned out to be a Fibroadenoma :) from my experience (especially seeing my mom go through all of this) I think if the doctors aren't worried they're usually right. They deal with this on a daily basis, so even though they can't be 100% certain until the results of the pathology come back I think they usually have a pretty good idea of what they're dealing with just by looking at what they see on the scans. Your mass has many benign characteristics which is also a good thing :) I am praying for benign results for you! Keep us posted. The odds are really in your favour :)",

      "Content": "J92 wrote: Hello everyone, I am posting on behalf of my mom. In December she was diagnosed with Stage III tripple positive IDC. Since then she has had a modified radical mastectomy and she has completed 6 rounds of FEC-D chemotherapy and she has a week left of radiation. Her skin has been very red and tender from radiation and she is experiencing some firmness and tightness under her arm which from what I understand is quite normal. Also, about half way through radiation she has been having some slight rib and collar bone tenderness when she touches the area, she says it feels like a bruise. She has brought up the rib and collarbone pain to the RO and he said that it is completely normal and should eventually subside. The reason why I am posting is because I am more worried about the collar bone pain just because I have seen several posts about rib pain during rads but not many posts about collar bone pain. Her collar bone area is extremely red, so she is definitely getting radiated there and the RO was not concerned. I just turned 21 and I've always suffered from some anxiety, but since this diagnosis my anxiety has been through the roof and I'm always worried sick. When my mom brought up the collar bone tenderness to the RO on Wednesday and he said \"you're getting radiated there too so that tenderness is normal\" I felt so relieved, but now that I am thinking about it I cause myself so much anxiety and worry. Has anyone heard of or experienced any of this during radiation? I am actually more worried about this and think about this more than my mom does. If someone can help ease my mind that would be great. Thank you :) Log in to post a reply",

Since then she's completed surgery (mastectomy), 6 rounds of chemo, radiation, and she will be finishing Herceptin in March 2014. :) Tomorrow is my mom's first mammogram since diagnosis on the \"good\" breast. I find that I am extremely nervous and worried about it. I am going with her tomorrow. I was just wondering if this is all normal? This year has been extremely, extremely hard for me. My mom is my best friend and I don't know what I would do with out her in my life. I've been to every appointment since day 1 and I've been her primary caregiver. Even though the worst is behind us (I hope) I still find myself having really bad days....I have plenty of good days, and of course I am doing much better than I was earlier this year, but when the bad days come, they're really bad and it sucks. I am a big worrier (lol) and I am really trying to work on that. This site has helped me so much even though I'm more of a lurker. I just wanted to post this to vent and I am just wondering if all of these feelings are normal? I feel that now that a year has passed I am feeling anxious. Thanks for taking the time to read this :) Log in to post a reply",
