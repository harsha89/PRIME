In some listings, we specify that we will consider your impairment to be disabling until a particular point in time (for example, at least 18 months from the date of diagnosis). We may consider your impairment to be disabling beyond this point when the medical and other evidence justifies it. 2. When a listing does not contain such a specification, we will consider an impairment(s) that meets or medically equals a listing in this body system to be disabling until at least 3 years after onset of complete remission. When the impairment(s) has been in complete remission for at least 3 years, that is, the original tumor or a recurrence (or relapse) and any metastases have not been evident for at least 3 years, the impairment(s) will no longer meet or medically equal the criteria of a listing in this body system. 3. Following the appropriate period, we will consider any residuals, including residuals of the malignancy or therapy (see 13.00G), in determining whether you are disabled. If you have a recurrence or relapse of your malignancy, your impairment may meet or medically equal one of the listings in this body system again. got this off ssa.gov. does that mean NED? i mean, since we're always in treatment...
