I truly would like to know the diagnosis and the plan of treatment asap but I know it will be a few more weeks before I will get there. So, praying and hoping for the best. Luckily, I can sleep. I am so exhausted from this emotional roller coaster that my body shuts down. Planning on watching Nebraska tonight. Heard it is a very good movie. Best wishes to you and your family! ",

I was diagnosed on February 25th, after the routine check up turned into the suspicious mammogram and then the biopsy.  At first it was DCIS and then the next day the doctor told me is IDC as well. Juggling between doctors' appointments, trying to be a mom to my 16-year old daughter, and working. My husband is very supportive but I can tell he is in shock as well. Bad news keep on coming for the last 10 days - I am now afraid to pick up the phone. There is no official diagnosis yet because doctors are waiting for the results from the surgery. But everything changes so quickly. At first I was told it is probably stage 1 because they cannot feel (neither can I) any lump. I was told that there are microcalcifications shown on the mammogram. Then after the biopsy: DCIS and IDC. No lumps that we can feel, no discharge, nothing. Surgeon opted for the lumpectomy that is scheduled for next Friday, March 14th, but then she called me and told me that the MRI that I took last Tuesday shows \"mass\" over an area of 6.5 x 1.5 x 3.8 cm, and at least one lymph node looks suspicious. They believe it is DCIS but they also told me earlier that I have IDC based on biopsy (confusing to me) - where is it then? Doctor still opts for the lumpectomy to see what is going on inside because they don't know what part is malignant and what benign. I went for the second opinion (oncologist) and he told me that with such a \"mass\" he would opt for mastectomy and referred me to the surgeon. I will be meeting him this Monday and deciding between lumpectomy versus mastectomy. It has been nerve wrecking, shocking week. Thank you for listening!",

Diagnosed on February 25th, went to the right breast mastectomy on March 12 and getting ready for chemo, radiation and hormonal treatment. My CT- scans for bones, abdomen, pelvis and chest along with heart echocardiogram will be on April 3rd. My doctor doesn't expect to find anything there but he needs to rule out a few percent of possibility before we start chemo in the beginning of May. I hate all of these tests and awaiting results is a plain torture to me. I am still on the emotional roller-coaster as I went from a very healthy woman in her 40s to being diagnosed with breast cancer within the matter of 2 weeks. My cancer was discovered during the routine annual mammogram, no prior symptoms, I didn't feel anything etc.  This is great forum and I am really grateful that I found it. Even though my husband and my 16-year old daughter are extremely supportive and compassionate talking to others with similar diagnoses is very helpful.  Best wishes to you all!",

Hate this cancer roll-coaster. Went to my radiation doctor for the first visit before my treatment starts. Since my chemo will start first week of May and will last 18 weeks radiation will be scheduled no earlier than late August. I was diagnosed with both DCIS and IDC, with clear margins for IDC but positive margins for DCIS. My medical oncologist ignored the fact of the positive margins for DCIS but radiology doctor didn't. He said that he wants his pathologist to review slides from my surgery, particularly that positive margins go into muscle with lymphovascular invasion present. It freaked me out completely!!! I asked him how DCIS (which is non-invasive) can have positive margins with lymphovascular invasion. It is contradictory and he agreed - that's why he wants to clarify this pathology.  Has anyone found any info or had the same problem?",

I am new here (diagnosed Feb. 25th) and going through endless doctors appointments and testing is a very shocking (still) experience to me, as I used to be a very healthy person. Am I overreacting?",
