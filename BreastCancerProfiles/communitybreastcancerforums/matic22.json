I hope you already have got the results and I think because your grade was 2 and the other prognostic factors were great, it should be low.The size does not matter, grade matters, so I think it is going to be okey. Would you be so kind and write down your scores.I am interested in your scores. I hope you are doing great and when we get the results, I will let you know.",

I think that anthracyclines and also taxanes would be of  NO benefit for you because your tumour profile is really favourable and lazy and it is not relapsing one. It does not matter if some cells have already gone through the blood, because every breast cancer is systemic disease but it never cause macrometastatic disease if the disease is not aggressive,so I think you would benefit mostly from tamoxifen and later on from aromatase inhibitor.Of course it is up to you but with these scores of oncotype and grade I highly ER,PR, tumour I would not do chemo because it would not bring any benefit but ses can be severe, with chemo, not only temporary, but later on permanent.No oncologist tell anyone what chemo can cause (also leukemia, especially with high donse doxorubicin and cyclophosphamid), so think rahter twice than once. Kind regards and wish you best. P.S.:I have also one comment on this jOHN hOPKINS site >\"ASK THE EXPERT\".,mAybe I am more knowledgable but I have not found this site very helpful in decision making.This lady stresses out the size and nodes, which is definitely old-fashioned, so I would not ask her because I think she does not points out so much this molecular stuff.Think about that!

Yes, she was diagnosed in February 2004, she had mastectomy and chemotherapy and now for 3,5 years on hormonal therapy.BUT we would really like to know her recurrence scores so that we could decide correctly beyond 5 year mark if she needs additional hormonal therapy or not.She was stage 2, ER/PR highly positive, but grade was 2 with mitotic count 1, so I think she could skip chemo, but we will see if I am correct. In 2004 I did not know so much about lobular carcinoma ,and did not know about oncotype, so I could not even ask an oncologist about that.Now her specimen is already in the lab, so we are waiting to get results.We will see how much and which therapy/if any is needed more based on her recurrence scores.I believe in your case(despite your tumour size) I WOULD do the oncotype if I were you because I am sure that prognosis mainly depends on the gene expression and biology of the tumor and NOT on tumor size, so please, if you can afford this test, order it(I had some problems here in our country, because some oncologists are so old fashioned and they strictly do on old prognostic factors, BUT then I had some argue with some of them and there are also some good oncologists who know that biologic profile of cancer is the most important thing for prognosis, and they helped me to form in the requisition form and the pathologist prepared the tumor block). I have also read recently that this test was done on stage 3 patients with 10 and more positive nodes(and those in the low risk group, only had about 28 % recurrence rate at 10 years),so if that would be true(that 10 positive nodes is independent very bad prognostic sign),all these patients would be dead in 10 years after the mastectomy. Well , I am so sad sometimes when I see many oncologists prescribe chemo or other therapy based on size of the tumor and nodes, and then patients with small tumours and negative nodes do have recurrences after 2 ,3 years in vital organs(because they do not get chemo or other suitable therapy because they are considered low risk group just based on size and nodes).I think this is totally wrong! Kind regards! MATIC",
