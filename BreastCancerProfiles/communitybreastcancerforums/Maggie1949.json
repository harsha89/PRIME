My mom passed away 8 years ago of pancreatic cancer while I was going through chemo. I am also not married no children and no siblings My dad died 6 years ago, so I have been through a lot, but never give hope.. there is always something that can be done. In lymphoma, we can get the cancer in the bone, it is not the best thing for it to happen, but we just adjust the chemo for it.",
