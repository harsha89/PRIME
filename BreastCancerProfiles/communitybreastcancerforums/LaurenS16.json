I've heard that the anti-hormonals, especially the AIs, can be really tough on your joints. I've been seeing a rheumatologist for years. My standard treatment is glucosamine/chondrotin supplements and fish oil supplements daily, and a two-day 40mg / day dose of steroids as needed. The supplements really do help. I haven't needed to take the steroids for over a year!",

Ok, I'll be honest, I'm trying to figure out if there is anything in the cafeteria I can eat at lunch that I actually WANT to eat.
