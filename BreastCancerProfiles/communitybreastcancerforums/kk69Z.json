As a matter of fact I was at my radiologist last week (last appt. to see her -goodie!) and she asked if I do self breast exams. I told her I probably wouldn't know what a lump feels like. Mine are dense and there is so many little bumps in mine. And when I told her they are dense, she said I probably would never feel it. Nice to hear. I wonder what a non-dense breast feels like. Anyone else with the dense problem?",

It wasn't until 5 months later did I find this site. I also had a lumpectomy (actually 2 for clean margins). I knew that cancer could spread to the lymph nodes, but I didn't know about auxillery and sentinal nodes. When I went into surgery I really wasn't even thinking about that. I was a stage 1. All I remember was the nurse telling me after I was out of surgery and wasn't even fully awake that they took out 3 sentinal nodes and it didn't go to any sentinal or auxillery nodes. I was very relieved to here that. I know you are thinking.  You will worry yourself to death until your surgery. Think positive and even if it did there are treatments and alot of support on this board. So many great women here. Very kind and supportive. Good luck",
