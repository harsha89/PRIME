This is what we call it at home since it sounds less scary to my boys (13 and 12) than \"chemo\". Sounds less scary to me too. ; ) The whole thing, including the cold cap, was a snap. (I had to ask if cap was cold enough... it was an initial shock when she plugged it in, but then, it was fine. I did take one ibuprofen before coming in, but it was a long time between that and getting going. I'm sitting here during my 90 minute cooling after treatments. I have very thick and somewhat curly hair, which maybe insulates too much, but also might give a benefit when I shed as I have a lot to spare. I brought stuff to ice my hands and feet, but decided to skip it and get work done instead. I think I'll wait til I feel tingles and then jump on that? Not sure. I worked through the whole thing today, even though they assured my the 50mg of benadryl would knock me out. That didn't happen - I was looking forward to a snooze! They also told me I would need a ride home, but I won't at all. I'm doing this on my own, and hoping to keep my diagnosis all to myself through whole thing (long story). My husband was on-call if I did end up needing a ride, but no need (he is buried at work due to flooding we had in our area, so it's better to let him work.... I know the worst is yet to come, but this was easy. According to my docs, I'm in a gray area as far as tumor size and diagnosis. They said it would be fine if I decided to forego chemo. Looking at everyone's diagnoses here, it seems everyone in my situation gets chemo. so I'm sure I made a good choice. Chemo will give me maybe a 2% benefit, they told me. I did NOT want to do this at all, but would hate to look back and regret not doing it, so just plowing through. Maybe when side effects set in, I can stop if need be, and still feel ok about getting whatever I got. Couldn't wait to come in and get this going. I just want to fast forward to the end. I'm sure everyone feels this way!",

I'll start using it on my cuticles and hope for the best.",

In a nutshell, I had no terrible side effects, aside from a bout of hives after 2nd infusion, and kept 99% of my hair (cold capped with paxman). I realize more shedding and side effects may come now that I'm done... time will tell! Tomorrow is my planning appointment for radiation. I'd considered skipping radiation and getting a double mastectomy instead, but when I met with my surgeon, he basically told me I'm crazy and talked me out of it. Still not sure what I *should* do, but I'm going to put my trust in my doctors (for once : ) I thought the end of chemo would never get here, and now I'm done!..... phew!",

      "Content": "Oct 3, 2018 07:47AM - edited Oct 3, 2018 07:50AM by umakemehappy Hi all! I am not a big board-poster, so I think this will end up being a loooooong post. I'll bullet-point it so it's easier to just skim over! ; ) I liked reading everyone's experiences, so I'll just plop mine here in case anyone else is like me. I'm now sitting here the day after #5 out of 12 taxols/herceptin and 30 days into all this. INFUSION DAYS: Infusion 1: easy-peasy. no side effects. Did get a few stomach cramps, but I think it was from neglecting to take my steroids with food or milk. Once I remembered to do this, no more GI issues at all. Infusion 2: ditto. easy , unitlllllll\u2026\u2026 5 days after this one, broke out in terrible hives! They don't think related to the chemo. No anti-itch creme or spray remotely worked. Loaded up on benadryl, and when that didn't work in the overnite hours, took even more. Right after that, seemed to get even worse. So following night, used allegra instead, cut out all benadryl, and they cleared right up. I googled, and it does seem as tho over-the-counter benadryl can have fillers/dyes, that CAN cause allergic reactions\u2026? Who knows, but I will never take OTC benadryl again! The benadryl I get in IV at infusion is ok since no fillers or dyes. This is probably not the cause of mine, but I'm not risking it. ha! Those hives lasted into infusion #3, but luckily it was not delayed for that reason. They lasted a week in total. Had bruising up and down my legs for several days after hives cleared up. Hives were EVERYWHERE, face included. My face was swollen as well as my hands and feet. I now take an allegra every night before bed. Infusion 3: easy. Infusion 4 easy. But after this one, was too tired to do the usual walking of the dog when I got home. Not sure if I was just beat, or if from the infusion itself. Infusion 5: Had a busy afternoon planned: had to get my sis to the airport, had to drop one kid at golf, pick up other kid up from ultimate frisbee, had to pick golf kid up, had to feed family, had to bring other kid to swim, had to pick that kid up from swim\u2026. You get it! So asked for reduced benadryl just to avoid potential fatigue like last time. They instead switched me to Atarax? Hoping hives don't come back for any reason! But was not tired and was able to walk dog as usual AND get all that other stuff accomplished. ; ) NEUROPATHY I have not iced at all to this point, as I have to work during treatment, and I stand up. I think I will wait til I start feeling tingles to jump on this. So far so good. I do take B6 every day. I have all the icing stuff when/if needed. I hear after #8 or 9 this could be a big issue. WORK I have only missed one day of work, and that was the day I was overmedicated and loopy from my hives! I work from home, so this has been easy for me. On infusion days I work throughout treatment (at a standing desk - it's great!), so literally have missed almost nothing. EXERCISE I continue to walk the dog 2 miles per day. I also do HIIT training 6 days per week for about 20 minutes. This is 30-45 seconds of cardio, followed by 30 second of weights, planks, pushups, crunches, etc\u2026then cardio again\u2026 back and forth for 20 minutes. It's great since I don't get too sweaty on my scalp, as I am cold capping. Wanted to ramp up the yoga, but find I am not having (or not making??!) the time to fit this in as well. DIET I do not eat red meat. I do eat seafood however. So far all my labs have been good, but I wonder if the red meat thing will change this at some point. I do have a smoothie every morning with lots of dark leafy greens in it. I'm worried about all the antioxidants I eat as I read that those also protect cancer cells and therefore fight the chemo. I reduced my daily vitamin by half due to this. I cut down on my coffees (now twice a week instead of every day, and I do decaf now (ugh!) to avoid any added sleep issues). Also - I have stopped my beer/wine/cocktail intake cold turkey! I KNOW!!! This SUCKS!! I drink tons and tons of water (with a lemon slice), and I feel like for the duration, I'm going to baby my liver while all these toxins are swirling around inside of me. I have had two non-alcoholic beers over this time. It is football season, after all (Go Pack Go!! ; ) HAIR I am cold capping with Paxman. So far so great. (But I will not rest on my laurels as I know this can change at any moment!). I have been taking Biotin daily since a week before I started any of this. I rinse my hair the day after treatment, then wash 3 days after (with the paxman shampoo/conditioner), and that's it. Always with cold water. I comb out gently with a wide-tooth comb ONLY before rinse or washing showers. I grip my hair at the scalp and comb out the ends to avoid pulling. I have NOT used the brush thing that came with the kit. My hair is way too thick for that thing! After the 3rd treatment I started also wrapping the outer cap with an ace bandage to make tighter, as I learned from a girl I met there doing same. She was on treatment 9 with a full head of hair, so\u2026. yeah. I was worried I didn't have things tight enough for my first two, but time will tell I guess. The ONLY cold capping rule I broke is that I do scrunch product into the ends of my hair as I have very thick frizzy (half-jewish) hair. With product it's a little more curly than frizzy. I am also doing satin pillowcases, and thanks to the girl with the ace bandage tip, I also now wear a hair net at night to avoid extra tangling. Anyway, so far, I seem to have lost LESS hair daily since I started than before this all happened. Maybe 30 hairs total? yay! I ordered that EES stuff for brows. Hasn't been delivered yet. Got an Rx for latisse from my dr., but I keep reading it doesn't work so I haven't filled it\u2026 I may just teach myself how to do false eyelashes when that time comes. It looks like my nose hairs are gone. I still have arm hairs, brows, lashes, pubes.. I haven't had to shave my armpits or legs for the last week tho, which is a huge change as I am pretty hairy and things grow fast and I have to shave every single day normally. NAILS I am taking biotin for hair and nails, and am also applying OPI Nail Envy every now and then. I only started the polish two weeks ago. I also think I'm going to start rubbing something into my cuticles but not sure what yet. And I keep all cut as short as I can go. So far so good. ATTITUDE This SUCKS, but in time, it will all be behind me! There is always someone worse off, so I do not complain. Some babies so sadly have to go through chemo, so I can certainly do it. On another note, I'm still hoping to go thru all this with no one knowing. My husband, sister, and kids know. No one else knows, even my best friends. My mom has terminal cancer right now, and if she knew this about me, it would devastate her. I also HATE attention, and don't want anyone making a fuss, which would just make me feel \"more ill\". RADIATION DOUBTS: I am almost sick about putting radiation in/on my body after all this, and I am going to bring up to my doctor doing a mastectomy of some sort instead (on both sides). I tested negative for like 80 genes, but nonetheless, I want to put all worries behind me. I know nothing about the types of boob jobs that are out there. Tried to look into it a bit on this site but was unsuccessful. (I don't wanna see any photos yet!). I'm a pretty tough chick, so I'm not too worried about surgery or recovery. I'd rather have a short hospital stay than, what? Like 30 daily trips into the hospital for radiation treatments? And lots chicks get boob jobs purely for vanity, so I can do it too, right? To save my life? As it was, my chemo alone was somewhat voluntary as I was in a gray area, I guess, so, gonna hit this with all I've got and then put it all behind me as best I can. Advice on all this welcome!!!",
