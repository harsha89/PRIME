It didn't show up on two ductograms, a mammo, an U/S, or MRI. It was incidental due to some very dark discharge that tested positive for blood. I have had an MRI every year since, and have had mammo and U/Ss every 6 months the last 2 years. I had spontaneous discharge three weeks ago from my right breast , lots of pain, was told probably mastitis by my breast surgeon and put on antibiotics. A few days later had my scheduled mammo and U/S and was dismissed by the radiologist as \"Looks fine. See you in a year.\" He was very quick and dismissive (thats what I get I guess for scheduling late in the day??) , and this appt was a 6 month follow up to \"3 areas of interest\". (report said \"extremely dense breasts and not abe to see anything due to this\") I go for a 6 month follow up MRI in 2 months for another area of interest in my right breast that gave me non-bloody spontaneous discharge 3 weeks ago. Oddly, today I awoke to blood on my shirt, and much more after slight manipulation on the right side. I was never offered drugs for the ADH. (I am 55 and post menopausal.) I would have it looked at if I were you. Better to be safe. Please update when you can. (I called my BS and left a message today about the bloody discharge so I'm not sure what her protocol will be...)  Cat",

His mom, my grandmother, was 95 when she died of colon cancer. She had a 30+ yr history of diverticulitis but no BC diagnosis. One interesting thing is that my dad was an only child so no telling if he had had sisters...would they have been diagnosed with BC? Hmmmm... Also, I am 50 and had my first colonoscopy Dec. 2011.

I am wondering if others diagnosed with ADH have an experience or input for me? Understanding that not everything is picked up by every imaging tool, my ADH was not seen on a mammo, ultrasound, MRI, or initial galactogram, nor did it show calcifications. I do not think a mammo, see you next time, is is going to be very helpful. Unfortunately, the meds mentioned have side effects and can cause health issues. I have too many issues that prevent me from taking them. >",

My right breast is \"achy\" as is my underarm. They found nothing in the u/s or mammo. About as week later I had spontaneous black discharge from my LEFT breast. I called my gyn' s office and they made an appt with a surgeon who wanted a galactogram and ultrasound of the LEFT breast. Both looked fine; no blockages. Some ductal ecstasia noted (like in 2006.) Anyway...the bloody discharge never resolved and the MRI report noted fluid, blood, proteinaceous debris so I could do another MRI in 6 months or excise the duct. The surgeon is a not \"wait and see\" in cases like mine so the excision and lumpectomy happened last week. That's where I got the ADH diagnosis. (Also, preoperative galactogram followed by a wire loc now revealed a blocked duct.)",

I did see the U/S when they did it, of course. Looked like a bunch of black holes, a lot like what cysts would look like, some round-like, some not so much. I go back in 5 months for my follow up. The tech said it could take 6-8 months for the huge, painful lump to go away. I have been on WW and wanted to start Zumba classes...guess not.

My periods were so heavy that when I had my R ovary and tube removed due to monthly cysts, the gyn did an endometrial ablation. Periods stopped within months. Ovary removed threw me into menopause at age 45. I had a tiny bit of bt bleeding a few times due to the fibroids after but maybe once in the last 3 yrs.

Mammo, u/s, galactogram, and MRI looked okay. Because the MRI said \"proteinaceous debris\" just where it is coming from the surgeon suggested an excision instead of another MRI recheck in 6 months. I have the ductal excision next week. (In 2006 the specialist said \"probably ductal ecstasia.)",

I posted last night to another thread: I have a diagnostic mammo and possible U/S this week. I have had many years of \"stuff\" going on: lumps, benign lump removed in '98, blood in discharge twice, MRIs, biopsies on both sides, ADH removed ( 6cm X 5 cm area) summer of 2013 on the L side. Now pain just below nipple on the R side that sometimes \"zaps\" to my tissue close to my underarm. Both Ns itch and R is extremely sensitive. Also, have some dull stabbing like pain that made me wonder if it was a heart issue at first but it's the L breast. That may be just ductal ecstasia stuff. This is an interesting thread. When I mentioned pain my BS scheduled a mammo and U/S. She is pretty thorough and doesn't like to mess around. I will update after mammo and U/S. Not to sound weird but my R nipple gets an area that draws together, thickens. It didn't do that before a few weeks ago Anyone ever notice something like that?",

Recap: I had a lumpectomy with excision in July. My initial mammo and diagnostic U/S in April were negative (I have pretty dense breasts)...In May I had brackish spontaneous nipple discharge from my left breast. MRI showed some bloody debris, galactogram negative. After waiting for an appt, they did another galactogram two weeks later (July) and the wire was now blocked. An excision and lumpectomy resulted in finding ADH. The surgeon removed a 6.5 x5.5 area. My right nipple area has been bothering me now with the same sharp pain when touched/bumped lightly. (Can't cross my arms, etc) I have some brown expressed discharge. My recheck mammo is in December....just wondering if I should call the surgeon earlier?",

(I have a long history of benign issues, surgery, Bx, etc. ADH in 2013 excised in left breast.) I had bloody nipple discharge on the right side 3 weeks ago. Had a galactogram, 3D mammo, and an ultrasound done and last week an MRI. The radiologist noted enlarged ducts as usual, bu no enhancements, etc. YAY! I mentioned that all of the same tests did not pick up the ADH in 2013 and she wants to send me for a surgical consult (same surgeon from 2013 whom I see regularly.) I am praying for this to happen over Christmas break as I teach. I had pneumonia all last week, and have had some of this breast testing done during school hours. Boss isn't very sympathetic. lol Just good thoughts and prayers, please. If this side shows atypia, what do you do but keep excising it?? Thanks everyone. :) XO, Cat",

Nothing really showed up on the mammo, u/s, or galactogram (very dense breasts). The discharge comes from the same duct, spontaneously and expressed. When expressed that side of the areola is painful...at 3 o'clock. I also have a \"dent\" just below the nipple tip at 3 o'clock when the nipple is erect. I can fit my pinky finger tip in it.",

Now having the dark discharge and a lot of pain in the same breast again. Wondering if I have more ADH. Discharge is from a different duct this time. I go in April for my mammo...My breast tissue is extremely dense. They never see anything. The BS wants me to have another MRI this June but I don't know if insurance will allow. ",
