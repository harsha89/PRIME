I found out last week it is a progesterone factor positive type of cancer (not sure of all the terminology yet, sorry). I am struggling with the choices I am suppose to make regarding preventative actions. I was told my choices are radiation or mastectomy. I am 42 and will be 43 in July. I am a single mom who works full time. I keep looking for answers as to what's best for me and I feel like I am not getting any where. I am alone in all of this. I have no significant other to help me hash out all the info.  My family tries to be supportive but none of them go to any of my doc appointments with me. So I am asking here to women who are dealing with or have dealt with making the choice:  radiation?  mastectomy?  or nothing? Now I don't know very much else about my cancer. I know that is sad. I know that it's not genetic and it's contained to only my left breast but there is a benign mass in my right (which I am told to follow up on in 6 months). I know that my bone scan, MRI, and my CT scan all came back with good results. I know that the tumor removed was the size of pea (as per all the docs I have seen \"you caught it very early!\"). So now what? Why do I feel like radiation or mastectomy are so aggressive for something that was taken out of my body and was so small? Any feedback, personal stories, or insight would be greatly appreciated.   Dx 6/1/2017, Left, <1cm, Stage IA, ER-/PR+ Surgery Lumpectomy: Left Log in to post a reply",
