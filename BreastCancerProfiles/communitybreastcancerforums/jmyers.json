I've decided to take my MP3 player with me.    I'll be back on after the appointment. Laughingwater,   I'll be thinking of you tomorrow as well.  My appointment is at 8am.  Thank you for kind words about my Dad.  Dad is doing much better.  He has his follow up appointment tomorrow as well. My husband is taking him for me.  (Since we have decided not to tell him anything until we know more what is going on.)  As for the brother-in-law who is the dentist sign me up for the happy gas as well.    I've not heard if they give us anything for pain afterwards. ",

Durning February he was in the ER four times.  In the middle of that is when I went in for my first mammogram.  So I've been dealing with him, work stress, and the stress of not knowing.  I just wanted the roller coaster to stop so I could get off for a bit.  Now that I've had a few days I'm doing much better.  I'm sure tomorrow the day before the procedure or the day of my nerves will kick back in. I would be happ to hold your cyber hand through this.  Sounds like we are having the same procedure done though.  I will be back on later that day and let eveyone know how it went. I to would like to thank all veterans for their thoughts and wisdom through this stressful time.",
