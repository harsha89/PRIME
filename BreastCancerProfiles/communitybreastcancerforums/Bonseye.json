Mine did not image on my Mammogram-10% of cancers, Lobular, do not image, Didn't show on my ultrasound either. My radiation oncologist couldn't figure out how iI found it, I had pain,..felt that it was different and after losing a friend to BC that had pain called my Breast Navigator that got me in right away. I had a biopsy the next day and the following day found out I had cancer. I had three positive nodes, only small amounts...but enough i needed chemo and radiation. Good thing I followed my heart and went to the doctor....I hate to think where I would be at this time had i ignored my pain. Even when i had the biopsy the doctor said the tissue was not a concern. Turned out it was....he was in total shock! Thank God for him listening and believing in me that I knew something was wrong. I am not an alarmist but knew the sharp stabbing pain was a concern. I need to be able to give back and help others understand the need to listen to their bodies. No need to panic,.,have mammograms for sure but if something is different-follow your heart. My husband and I try not to think too much about the \"what if\" I had ignored this...take a breath and get a recommendation for a good breast surgeon-GP's are not informed enough from my experience. A Second Opinion from another Breast Surgeon may put your mind at ease. I got two opinions for every step of this journey. Please don't panic as implants do have complications and being pregnant takes a toll on the body.....keep us up to date",

This has been a major set back for me. For some reason in December I had a 102+ fever and spent 5 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics and just 8 weeks later (two weeks ago) I had it hit me hard again.I spent another 5 days in the hospital. No one can figure out where this came from. I am so very careful, electric razor, hand sanitizer......I have 5 amazing doctors very perplexed. This last infection has left my arm still red (after 2 weeks on oral meds) and they have me on oral antibiotics for a full month since this happened so fast again.  Today I picked up my sleeve that was ordered for me.  I got a Juzo sleeve and am waiting for my guantlet to come in.  I put it on in the store and the women who runs the medical supply part was so helpful.  When we got it on properly my arm almost felt \"cold\". I wore it for 5 hours. I couldn't take it any more so I removed it and my arm is killing me.  I had a Lymphedema PT specialist that measured me. I know that she said it would be really tight but once the fluid goes down it will be a bit more comfortable.  I am guessing this is \"normal\"  but I did feel my arm also was a bit more red after removing the sleeve.  Just another torture to endure.  I am so trying to deal but after 17 long months, this is so painful.  Any advice to survive the \"break in\" period?",

I too am nervous and my friend whom went through it three years ago said it really wasn't that bad. Make sure to ask questions and let them know how you feel so they can help you. Let us know how you did and it is great to have others to share with. Hope you are feeling well !",

When I had my IUD out I almost bled to death...had emergency surgery, had got my period like I was bleeding to death at that time too but they did let me leave on my underwear. It was a short surgery so i was relieved! It better stay away-LOL!",

The last patient that was sent with less then four nodes didn't need radiation. I soooo don't want it as i need to have a re-construction of my right side that had a staph infection. They took out my expander and if I need radiation then they have to use my back muscle to reconstruct that side. I am physically in pain from rheumatoid arthritis and need an easier road. As it is now I wake up with such bad back spasms. I feel like I will live on pain meds. At this rate will my life be pain free? ! I am trying to stay opened minded and if I need it...then i need it...we shall see what this next chapter will bring. I have a glimmer of hope and am holding on to it with the belief that there is always a chance. I feel like they removed everything (bilateral mastectomy and nodes removed) and having chemo....what are they radiating? Just curious....there are side effects with that too. Can't wait to ask. One of my opinions is Sloan Kettering one of the leading Cancer Institutes in the US. Based out of NYC they have a satellite 6 minutes from my house here in NJ. Trying to not get ahead of my self....small steps.......",
