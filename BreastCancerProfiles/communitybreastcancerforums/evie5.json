I've been checking out Cedars-Sinai and City of Hope.  This is what is happening: I'm having trouble lining up my preferred PS with my bilat surgeon. I was diagnosed in early April and my surgery, which was finally scheduled for the last week of May, was postponed again by the PS for at least another week. Now I'm seriously considering finding another hospital. Thanks in advance for any recommendation! Or tell me who not to see....!! Log in to post a reply",

When I was first diagnosed with having DCIS in only one breast, my plan was to do a muscle-sparing DIEP reconstruction. Now that my other breast has been diagnosed with invasive cancer, I was told that a bilat mastectomy plus bilat DIEP would run about 12-15 hours. Since I did not want to put myself through such a long surgery, I decided on implants.  Did you consider Cedars-Sinai at all, or was it always UCLA?",
