I had mammograms, ultrasounds, xrays, CT scans, MRI's and bone scans but they couldn't find the primary source. I was then presented with two options, further testing to try and find the primary or mastectomy to see if it could be found that way. By now it was 2 months since I'd found the lump in my armpit and nearly a month from my dx. I opted for a mastectomy (right side) knowing there was a possilibity that the primary would not be found in the breast because I knew the cancer was in the nodes and wanted to get my treatment underway. In August I had radical mastecomy (ironically, on my birthday - I call it my rebirth day) and sure enough, they were unable to find the primary in the breast. I did have 15 involved nodes though. So, I've got stage III ER-, PR- Her2+ occult breast cancer. Does anyone out there have any experience with occult breast cancer? I avoid googling - too much contradicting info out there.
