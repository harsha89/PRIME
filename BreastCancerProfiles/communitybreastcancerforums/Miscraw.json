Last week I finally had my hubby cut (not shave) all the long strands that were left. I've been using Nioxin since I finished chemo & taking 5000 biotin. I have some regrowth on top, but none on the sides yet. I bought some minoxidil but haven't used it yet. I've read that if you stop using it, that hair will fall out again. Has anyone found that to be true or have a better suggestion of what to add? I was really hoping for a cute pixie cut for a June Vegas trip!",

I just wish my sides would grow more. Anyone have an idea why the sides aren't really showing new growth, but the top of my head is full and thick as can be? I have hair on the sides, but it's mainly what I didn't lose in the first place.",

I was worried that it I started it, that I would lose that hair if I stopped. Are you still using it? MinusTwo- yep! On Herceptin for another 6 months. I wondered if that could be hindering things. It's just weird though because the top of my head & the back is growing like crazy.",
