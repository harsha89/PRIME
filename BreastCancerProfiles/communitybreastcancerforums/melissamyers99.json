The ONLY reason she had scheduled a diagnostic mammogram was because of past members of my family had BC. The dr told me not to worry because of my age its probably nothing..i had the mammogram done a few days later and needless to say the tech could not find lump and put sticker where she thought she felt it..i explained it wasn't the right spot ..but the spot she took pic of did show a small lump size of a bb. When i had the ultrasound the tech had me lay on my side and she could not find the lump..i had asked if i should lay on my back and she had said no..she finally asked for me to lay on my back and show her where lump was and she felt it as well it just wouldn't show up on ultrasound ..she did hightlight and measure a spot off from the lump (closer to armpit) i had asked what she highlighted and she told me a \"nodule \" and left the room..next day report said nothing showed up in ultrasound and not to worry probably just a cyst and to watch it..when i asked them what tech highlighted they said a lymph node and it was of normal size.. so now im really confused have no idea if im doing the right thing by having lump removed or if im over reacting (i have been getting this lately) is there any advice anybody could give me?
