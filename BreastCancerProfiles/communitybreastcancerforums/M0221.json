I was happy to not have to go back the following day for the shot, but if I had to the drive is only about 20 minutes. I would see if they can do your chemo education before your first day of treatment. There is a lot of good information and things you may want to get ahead of time. Please keep us postedon how you are doing. Sorry that we all have to take this crazy ride together.  Melinda0628 - I am so sorry you are dealing with all of this. I had a 'losing it' moment when they told me last week I would need radiation when I wasn't counting on that at all. Some days are better then others. Just know that it is ok to lose it from time to time... you are entitled and you don't have to keep it together 24/7. Your chemo dates will be close to mine, I start on the 28th. Keep us posted on how you are.",

I know my friend wouldn't care if I came wearing jeans and a gigantic sweatshirt, but it just made me sad. Decided on a very pretty tunic with a skirt. The tunic hides the fact that I am without breasts for now. Port update:My neck is getting incredibly sore now about 8 hours out of surgery. Mostly when I turn to the left or cough.

I definitely thought about fleeing chemo treatment today, but then common sense and a belief in medical care took over and I am set to go. I heard the same about feeling pretty good the first few days before side effects kick in. I only worked PRN part time and my office has been so amazing with me just showing up when I am up to it. I am the insurance coordinator and billing advisor in a small dental office so the world doesn't end if I'm not there. A lot of what they need they can call me at home and I can either talk them through it or get online and handle it from my recliner. And I am very blessed to have people that are helping through this. My heart goes out to anyone that doesn't have a strong support system. I'll be praying for an easy port placement for you tomorrow! And YES for the meds!I've never taken any meds but I figure I may as well take what they are offering now! No need to try an tough this out. Provence, Thanks for the thoughts and prayers! I'll let everyone know how it goes. Time for all of us to start kicking cancers butt! MJ aka M0221",

It wasn't terrible nausea and I never felt like I would throw up. My GI tract is messed up, lots of stomach rumbling with no bathroom success. And burping, which is odd because I am on an antacid and I never burp. My Neulasta injection went off today at 4:30pm...hoping I don't get any of the bone pain. Preemptively taking 600mg of ibuprofen twice per day for seven day's at the advice of my MO. She said if I feel that doesn't help move to pain meds. So far so good! Worst part so far is I can't believe how tired I am! Absolutely exhausted. I did get out to take the kids to the orthodontist this morning and I ordered a new wig.

My MO believes in giving everything up front so if I need it I don't have to call and wait for it or worse have it happen at night when the pharmacy is closed. Hoping I won't need most of them. They insist on the vitamins, the steroid, Zantac, and Zyrtec. Highly suggest the Ativan and insist on 1 mg an hour before chemo. The rest are there for just in case side effects. I have a really high pain tolerance so I am not anticipating needing much for the bone pain from Neulasta",

It looks like we have 13 posting for themselves and 2 that are reading posts so they know how to help loved ones starting in January. Sorry you have to join us, but glad we can be here for each other. And I am thrilled you have a good support system. I am 49 years old and I have 15 year old boy/girl twins, a husband of 25 years and amazing friends. I cannot imagine this journey without them. I had no trouble at all with port placement. No pain, minimal bruising and mild neck stiffness for a few days. You'll do great",

That happened to me with radiation. I was sure that a bilateral mastectomy with negative nodes had me in the clear and then I got the report of a 'close and questionable' surgical margin. Better to be safe though, so I will Forge on with a smile. I hope you will be given some chemo education. It was helpful to me just so I knew exactly what meds to take when and to be able to have all the prescriptions filled well in advance Chemo for me was because of my oncotype score, premenopausal age and grade 3 tumor. Keep us posted! Merry Christmas!",

I also re-did the meds list they gave me at my chemo education visit into something that was easy to read for me or any caregivers at a quick glance. I bought a basket and labeled all the kids of meds with a black sharpie so they are easy to find. I also bought a pill box with morning and evening boxes. I loaded it for a week. That way I will know if I have forgotten to take a med. I set an alarm on my phone for daily reminders to take meds at 7am and 7pm. Any meds I need for nausea or constipation/diarrhea etc... are in the box and at my fingers tips if I need them. I ordered headcovers from headcovers.com and will be ordering my wig Thursday. I had very long hair and went chin length last Friday so the change would not be so drastic. I will get a pixie cut 14 days after first chemo. For now I am as ready as I can possibly be",

People tend to post when they are having side effects and not so much when things go well. It got me scared several times for no reason because their experiences thankfully were not what I experienced. I was SO thankful when I felt nothing from the nuclear medicine injection for the sentinel node biopsy and I had no pain what so ever with my port placement. I am honest scared to death about tomorrow. My husband and closest girlfriend will be with me. I feel like I watched to many Criminal Mind episodes...I feel like I am heading into a leathel injection and I won't come home. Sounds overly dramatic and I am hoping once the initial infusion happens I will be less afraid. Fear of the unknown. I honestly don't know why we all get different drugs. I know there are so many factors and the chemo is very specialized for each person. Depends on age, grade, hormone + or neg, Her2 status, oncotype or mammoprint scores and many other things. Feel free to send me a PM if you ever want to chat. I'll let you know how tomorrow goes. Oh, I will get IV steroids and Benadryl tomorrow as well. I believe Taxotere depletes vitamin D and something else takes the B vitamins.",

I am having a reaction to the steroid. They lowered the dose to see if it will help. I don't want to totally have to come off of it because it will help with me not getting neuropathy in my feet and hands and will also prevent swelling of my legs and abdomen. I should be good today and tomorrow. We will see how Friday goes. Praying for minimal and very bearable side effects. Hope lowing the dose will work and I won't have to completely come off the steroid. Splitting headache for the last 18 hours that won't go away with meds, stomach cramps and nausea, and a very bright red flushed face that is hot to touch. They said it is definitely the Decadron. Lowering to half the dose. We can do this ladies!",

No complications, really no pain. I went into chemo overly optimistic, naive and unprepared for the side effects. My second infusion is January 18th and with the help of my MO we are hoping to avoid complications and the side effects of the first infusion. There were so many and I try and only post positives here so I won't list them all but geez it was rough. My thoughts are this: I have chemo every 21 days. I had 10 absolutely horrible days. That means that I will have 11 days that are good or at least tolerable. That means I am having more good days then bad days. Which means I am WINNING. The hardest part is watching my son and daughter (15 year old twins) watching me go through this. I feel like I have (the cancer has) stolen some of their innocence, their carefree life, their joy. That makes me sad. I pray for each and every one of you and I hope that treatments are going well and are bearable.",

My PS wanted to do a delayed reconstruction so I won't even get expanders until treatments have finished. You will do fine with the port. I honestly had no pain with it at all. Sore throat and a bit of a stiff neck for 48 hours. Other then that just bruising. Hope you have a wonderful holiday",
