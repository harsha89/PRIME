      "Content": "canuckintx wrote: Good Morning, everyone: I was involved in a car accident late last Saturday evening.  At the time, I was very shaken up - I was driving and the seat belt and airbacks came into direct contact with the area where I had a lumpectomy 6 weeks ago.  I have some bruising and abrasions, but until this morning, nothing to be concerned about.  When I was showering this morning, I noticed an indentation where the surgeon had removed the tissue during surgery - this was not there prior to the accident!  Also, my breast is sore today.  I'm concerned about the tissue being redistributed and any left over cells running rampant - am I over-reacting?  I don't even know what doctor to call - my PCP, surgeon, or oncologist?  I haven't started any treatment yet...waiting for oncotype score.  Any comments/advice would be appreciated.

My tumor is 1.2 cm, low grade, stage 1 according to the initial pathology report from my core needle biopsy.  The surgeon I met with today seems very competent, pretty much told me that he would perform a lumpectomy with a sentinel node biopsy - and refer me to an oncologist following the surgery based on the pathology report from the surgery.  In the midst of our consult, he got paged, and for the remainder stood up and quickly answered my questions.  In a nutshell, he indicated that my cancer isn't very serious, and that I have a 95% chance of not getting any further breast cancer.  Can he honestly predict that before conducting surgery?  I really felt like he was minimizing the seriousness ofmy cancer.  I know that in the big scheme of things, that my cancer is probably less serious than many on these boards, but it is still weighing heavily on me.  Also, the local \"community\" hospital is small.  I know that I shouldn't base my decision on the hospital facilities, and that big doesn't mean better, but it makes me a little nervous.  When I asked him whether I should have a diagnostic MRI, he said \"no\" because my tumor is so small.  Any thoughts on this from those of you who have been through the process?  I am planning to get a second opinion from a surgeon at Baylor in Houston for comparison purposes.
