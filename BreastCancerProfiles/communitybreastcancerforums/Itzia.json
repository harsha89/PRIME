When my OB-gyn was doing a physical exam I experience a bloody secretion from my nipple. She ordered a mammogram and sonogram. The two studies revealed very dense great tissue, calcification and a lot of cysts but nothing that was of concern for the radiologist and they didn't find a reason for the blood. I had an MRI done last Saturday and am waiting to hear back from the surgeon about those results. I'm a little more worried this week because my breast started hurting yesterday and when I checked I found a vey large bump behind my areola area that is very painful. I don't know anyone who can advise me on this situation other than my doctors so I would really appreciate any input from others whom have gone through something similar. Thank you in advance.",
