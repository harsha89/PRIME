I just wanted to lay in bed forever. Actually having a cut in the abdomen to me was a little worse and inconvient than the BMX. Almost every body movement is affected by your abdomen muscle. Walking, sitting, lifting, was all affected. But for the BMX, I just try to limit the use of my arms right after surgery and it was fine. With a C-Section I carried a very excited and happy feeling so the pain didn't feel that bad even though it was.  But the BMX, I was depressed and scared, so it made the pain worser than it really is. In truth, the pain is manageable and most people are up and around by the first week. It goes by quick. Just make sure you take the pain relievers and rest up.",

Reading your posts reminded me of the nightmare of getting BC. The BS told me the same thing, about chemo and age, etc... But they won't know the cocktail until after the surgery when you get your pathology report. I got thru it fine with lots of preparation mentally and physically. Lots of sisters on the forum can give you realistic advice. Once you get thru surgery, everything else will fall into place and life goes on. Good luck and will be thinking of you.",

I was diagnosed at 36 through a routine mammogram, which my gyn did not feel was even necessary at my age. If i did not do that mammo, i would walk around 4 more years not knowing. You are way younger than me, but I feel everybody still thinks BC happens mainly to older women or women with BC in the family. I was neither, so it caught me by surprise. Definetly get a second opinion and get answers. And keep a close eye on any changes and report to your doctor right away. I have a young toddler too, so I understand the feeling of having to be responsible for your baby and the need to stay healthy for them. Good luck!",
