      "Content": "Jan 25, 2019 01:55AM - edited Feb 13, 2019 04:55PM by Ldc1 I am in an almost identical situation. Stage IIa, 4mm tumour removed by lumpectomy and sentinal removal showed macromets 3mm tumour in one node. 100% receptor positive and her neg. Grade II. Waiting for onctotype score but drs are saying depending on the score, possibly no chemo and no rad on the nodes. I am nervous. I feel like I want to throw everything at this. 47yrs old with one daughter. I am so stressed about this decision. Oncotype is not yet validated for node positive, nothing yet published. Did you have any regrets? I would be willing to do cold caps also on chemo, likely 4 cycles of Taxol unless onco come back high. Thx",

Use of oncotype on node positive women to predict recurrence is new and not yet validated. The acience is there but not yet published,I am told. And standard of care wothout that score would be chemo and full rad. Still waiting for my oncotype but my decision won\u2019t change.",
