I consulted with a lot of doctors concerning the SAVI and in the end I realized it's not the best treatment for me. I was very focused on whether or not the device could fit in the area of my cavity, because there's not much space there. The answer seems to be it can, but I'm not an ideal candidate because the area that surrounds the cavity is not all breast tissue. It would be close to the chest wall and the skin, and for optimal treatment it should be sitting in the middle of breast tissue. I'm starting traditional radiation in about a week:( Also, my lumpectomy was on July 30, NOT June. I'm so glad SAVI worked out for you!",

Others are singing the praise of brachytherapy. I have done a ton of research, which only makes me more confused and scared. The only type of brachytherapy I can do is with the SAVI device, because I am smalll and my tumor cavity is 5mm from the skin and right against the muscle.

Should I try to get my seroma drained before radiation??? ",

I'm glad you're getting more opinions and hopefully someone will figure this out so you can continue with your treatments. rcca- I didn't know they took a blood count to show you're menapausal. That's great news because I was worried I'd get the wrong drug when the time comes. I'm somewhere in between. Questions- I have a soroma from the surgery which has been a little painful throughout and is getting more so with radiation. I wenet to the surgeon before radiation and the onc rad to make sure it was a good idea to start rads. They both thought it was. Since I've only had 8 treatments and am in pain now, I'm worried about the future. Does anyone else have this situation? Also, I bought Rad-x cream for $25 and realized it's basically aloe vera and lidocaine. I want to buy 2% lidocaine and mix it with my lotions. Then I'm not stuck using one thing. Has anyone done this. Does this make sense to you??",

It only takes 3 minutes to do the treatment. Is that less than with other machines? CT124- My story is similar to yours. They were watching calcifications with mammograms and ultrasounds every 6 months for about a year and a half. Finally, a radiologist suggested that I get an MRI. The cancer was glowing on the MRI. They could see it on the mammogram after they knew where it was from the MRI. I'm going to get an MRI every year now.  KaeB- I'm so sorry you are dealing with this a third time. I hope your treatment goes smoothly! Bambaloos-\"fat, bald & have tatoos.\" You're also really funny! Totally cracked me up!! Bubbalu- I wish you NO MORE BURNS!!! With regard to red wine, I imagine it helps the skin because it's an antioxidant. They tell us not to eat too many antioxidants, but what's too many. I find this to be confusing.  They put an \"X\" on my affected breast with a sharpee and covered it with tape. That stays on throughout the treatment, and the tape will be changed as needed. Do others have tape on their boob? Obviously I can't put lotion there and it's a pretty large area. Good luck to everyone going through this. Let's hope September is an easy month! ",

Is the cornstarch instead of deoderent? Has anyone tried Burt's Bees Honey & Shea Butter Body Butter? Seemed like a good idea when I was at Walmart today, but not so sure now.  ",

I don't know how long you have to wait after radiation to get it. I'm certainly going to look into that. As far as a flu shot, I got one pretty early on during radiation. With all that's going on I didn't even feel any ache from the shot. I hope your treatment goes smoothly!",

On monday I was set up and the doctor came in to check the set up that he was approving for the rest of the week. He looked at me, asked who my surgeon was, and commented that he really did a lot of cutting. I was puzzled because my surgeon was very precise and an excellent surgeon. When I finished and saw myself in the dressing room, I saw the area that they drew on it. IT WAS HUGE, STARTED JUST OUTSIDE OF MY TUMOR CAVITY AND CONTINUED BEYOND MY BREAST BONE. I went to talk to the doctor and he said I'd have to talk with the physicist as well. To make a long story less long, he totally messed up on the planning AND even with the bad plan I was lined up about an inch off of the plan to make it further away from the tumor cavity. I came back later to talk with him after he reviewed it and he once again blamed his bad plan on my susrgeon because he said the surgeon put little metal markers in which he was following and a wire over my scar and he accidentlly followed the wire so his plan was just too long. This wasn't at all true becaue his plan didn't even go near the cavity, my surgeon did NOT put metal markers in (some do), and the cavity is easy to see on the computer. So, he revised my plan and my husband (a doctor) went with me the next day and we spoke to the doctor who was covering for mine as well as the physicist. This doctor was so nice, didn't make any excuses for what happened, and helped us go over the plan with the physicist. My husband asked the physicist to come in for the set up. The doctor checked the set up and made little changes and was so careful. On wednesday another doctor was there and she also was so careful, touched me to feel the cavity.... (My husband told them he wants the doctor to check me every day as well as the physicist). Today my doctor will be there. I'm worried that I might jump off the table and strangle him. I didn't know doctors touch and look and make adjustmenets to the set up. DO YOUR DOCTORS MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SET UP AND LOOK THROUGLY??? If my doctor just glances at me today, I'm going to say something.",
