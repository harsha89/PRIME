If our badge reading is high we are given notice and it is investigated. I have been in the field for 25+ years working in the rooms where \"fluoro\" is used and have never had a high dose letter or any need for further investigation. The newer CT scanners that are out have the ability to monitor dose and record it in the system. I think this is excellent for patients such as us that may require multiple exams throughout our lives. I have had multiple CT scans and have even signed up for research programs using CT. I don't attribute my cancer to the scanning but I did have a cardiac CTA last year and my breasts weren't shielded. My dose was low so I never gave my CT exposure a second thought. I figure there is always MRI or PETCT once I've had enough CT. Those are the other options. Always ask for shielding of areas that are not being scanned. The facility where I work is now investigating a breast shield during scanning for women so that it is fit to the area and the scatter radiation is not going up under the shielding. I can definitely say that the staff where I work have always shielded me of which I am thankful for. Julie ",

I just had surgery on August 11th and the left breast, the one with no cancer, has been swollen on the lateral side and around the underarm. I showed it to the plastic surgeon the day after surgery while still in the hospital but he said it is early yet and not to panic. It is almost two weeks from surgery and it has gone down and is not as painful but I worry about that for the future. Did you have problems on that side right after surgery and it was dismissed because it was so close to surgery? I also thought that I would not have problems on that side because there were no nodes removed from the left.",

I have an appointment with my plastic surgeon and a medical oncologist this week and will ask both of them to check it out and recommend a lymphedema therapist for me to see just to check it out. Thanks again and I hope that your therapy helps you. I will keep you posted. Julie",

I know some people just can't seem to stay out of other people's business even though there are HIPAA regulations that we all follow. Some people think they are just being helpful but there are butting in where they have no business. Now, don't get me wrong. Some people that I thought would be there for me no matter what turned out to be real turds. They couldn't look me in the eye or they wouldn't talk to me the way they used to. I guess it was just a way to weed out the bad seeds in our lives and focus on the people that stuck with us through thick and thin. My real friends let me sob on the phone or would come over and make me laugh. Hell, sometimes I would be laughing while I was crying. It was all so surreal. Wabi-sabi.....keep us posted and I'm praying for you. Waiting is definitely the hardest part.",

I wanted them to be on the same page that I was on because I didn't want to blindside them by telling them that I had cancer. I kind of wanted to prepare them whether it was good or bad. My mom and my sister are both RN's so I knew I would hear it if I hadn't said anything to them until I found out I had cancer. I think I talked to them both so much in the two days that I waited for the results that it kept my mind off of what I was waiting for. They were both with me the whole way. This was my second episode of cancer so I think it scared both of them. I also work in the medical field, of course in the Radiology Department. The radiologist called me on my office phone and gave me the news. The first thing I did was call my boss who came to my office immediately. I was fine because it hadn't hit me yet. I have some very close friends at work so I informed them individually. There was so much support I really couldn't believe it. They implemented every Wednesday as Breast Cancer scrub top day and everyone wears the same scrub top on Wednesday. They even brought me one while I was in the hospital for my mastectomy. That was in 2009 and every Wednesday everyone still wears their scrub tops. You will know who to tell and who not to tell. It is very personal.",

They both said to use mederma????? (I think that's how you spell it) I haven't purchased it yet but plan on getting it tomorrow. They said to use it only on one of my breasts because I had to have some of the sutures redone on the other and you can't use it until you are healed. But, my dermatologist suggested the silicon sheets so I may try both. Good luck in your recovery. Julie",
