It is firm and rounded with no pain. I kept putting it off but have finally made an appointment to get it checked out. I guess Im just nervous... Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 3, 2012 01:59AM - edited Jul 3, 2012 02:02AM by samico51487 I had my ultrasound this morning and the radiologist found 3 lumps... not just the one that I felt originally. He said that one has the characteristics of  a fibroadenoma but he was unsure about the other two. He said they are not shaped like fibroadenomas. He did reassure me that they are all probably fibroadenomas but is requesting a biopsy just to be sure. Luckily he said he would be able to get to all three lumps with one incision. I believe he said it would be an ultrasound guided biopsy. I'm only 25 and I know chances are slim but I can't help but be a little worried. There isn't a ton of family history but my grandmother on my dad's side did have breast cancer. I did some research and that didn't really ease my worries much. I have no pain and one of the lumps had edges that were really undefined. Has anyone here ever had a fibroadenoma that wasn't oval in shape with undefined edges. I am however glad I did not have to wait an entire week for the ultrasound results like my doctor originally advised me.. Now I'm just waiting to find out when I can get my biopsy done",

Nothing has changed so I will being getting an ultrasound on Monday. Keeping my fingers crossed that it's nothing. I almost hate the internet because its so easy to look up symptoms and over think everything. Thank you for the comments they calmed my nerves I guess it's just a waiting game now. I was told it would take about a week to get the results after I have my ultrasound.",
