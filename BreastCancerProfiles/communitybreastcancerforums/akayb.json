They did note that because of where I was in my cycle I had a lot of background uptake. They still felt like they were correct in their biopsy sample. They numbed me up pretty good so I could have driven myself home if I hadn't taken xanax. I had to ask my doctor for the xanax to take for the procedure. I would highly recommend asking for a dose. Good luck to you and hoping your results come back all normal! AKB",

It hasn't changed since I originally noticed it a little bigger than it was when surgeon saw me in February. One one hand I don't want my MRI to show a false stable (so not enough time between to show a change if there really might be one) but on the other hand I don't want to give a chance to spread if there's something there. Also, my first biopsy was a bunch of terms for fibrous and dyplasgia (not atypical) and my surgeon said discordant with scans. Then on second biopsy got focus of fibrous tissue and she was ok to wait six months for repeat MRI. I'm also worried the correct spot wasn't biopsied. I've heard breast tissue easily moves. Thanks to you both for responding to me. I wish this would all go away and there would be a way to know for sure. Wishing you both the best.",

Plan wasn't to follow up in 3 months. My follow up is March 1. So soon, but this weird lump/fullness is scaring me. The other thing is since my scare in nov I have been doing regular brear/lymph node exams and this is a definite change. I've already called my doctor's nurse for their opinion and to see if I can be seen sooner. My question is those with palpable lymph nodes - could you feel a single node, or was it more of a general fullness Thanks for any info possible. Log in to post a reply",

MRI had BIRADS 4 for the following findings: 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm linear non mass enhancement, subtle asymmetric clumped non mass enhancement retro areola, 0.9 cm oval mass. US negative so MRI guided biopsy completed. So that was basically a second MRI. Oval mass was a fibroadenoma, linear non mass enhanacement came back as proliferative fibrocystic changes, pseudoangiomatous strongly hyperplasia. My doctor said these results were discordant with the MRI and she had me repeat the MRI guided biopsy. (So third look with MRI kind of) second MRI biopsy of the linear enhancement came back benign focally fibrotic breast tissue. She said she believed it this time. Follow up in 6 months with MRI No lymph nodes mentioned as enlarged on the reports. Nothing palpable. Now here I am 4 months later and the fullness to my right axillae going on about 6 weeks. Saw breast specialist who noticed it and felt a few nodes but said not pathologically enlarged. And the fullness was superficial and wasn't worrisome. I didn't think normal ever to feel axillary nodes. And it's a change. The fullness and nodes weren't there before. Trust me, I have been checking regularly. The fullness has increased since I saw her Feb 6. Not sure about the nodes but seem same and small. Nothing majorly different. Just overall fullness is more prominent. Why is 6 months the standard follow up? It seems so long. I would really like one now to make sure nothing new in my breast is causing even physiological enlargement. Even if the nodes aren't involved with CA couldn't they be a sign on something going on in my breast. Should I push for the MRI to be done sooner than May? Thanks so much for your help",

I'll try to make this brief. :) My story started this summer: Red, painful, itchy nipple for days. Improved, but not resolved. GYN saw me, wasn't too concerned and said she would watch another 1-2 months and if doesn't go away we should image. Oct rolls around and it's better, but still hyperpgimented and slightly thickened. Mammogram and US both normal. Breast Radiologist examined me that day and referred to breast surgeon because right nipple definitely different. Nipple biopsy done, I requested to go ahead with MRI and not wait on results just to be thorough. Nipple biopsy negative, yay! MRI has three abnormal areas of concern BI-RADS IV. - clumped non-mass enhancement under my nipple with thickened skin. Felt to be more than would be expected from recent nipple biopsy. Biopsy of area recommended. - \"oval mass\" 9mm. Possible node but did not enhance exactly as a node would. Biopsy recommended. - linear non-mass enhancement almost to my chest wall. 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm. Biopsy recommended. I had my MRI guided biopsy last Thursday (11/17) ouch!!! They were unable to do the area under my areola due to close proximity to the skin. But I'm told got the other two areas. I go tomorrow am for results. I've been stressing all day - did she get the right area. Can she be sure. I know they have the scanner I'm just worried about her getting a good sample. Anyone with a similar story, or thoughts on this. I've tried not to worry hut the area of linear enhancement is so large. It makes me worry. I go from being very positive thinking this is nothing, to the opposite and freaking out. Zero family history and I'm 34 years old. :( Any advice or similar stories are welcomed. Thanks so much!!

Not because I have to repeat the MRI biopsy, things happen. Not that I have to pay thousands more to have it done. Not the pain. But because I'm basically back at square one and they can't do the biopsy until dec 1. Which means I am back at square one. Then around 6pm the nurse called me back. Bless her heart I'm sure she was ready to go home for the day. And she explained things better than the surgeon. Imagine that. :) I asked how they caught it. How they knew it wasn't the right area. Do they look back on all patients? She said no, my physician didn't believe the normal path report. She reviewed with the scans with radiology and they agreed, the results didn't match the way the area looks on MRI. They are expecting abnormal cells. She went on to reassure me that doesn't mean malignant cells but of course still makes me worry..a lot. Plus the fact she feels that strongly to repeat the biopsy while my breast is still black and blue makes me feel like she's leaning towards malignant. VERY thankful the surgeon was aware enough to know that wasn't an expected result and to repeat it The nurse said my surgeon is working with radiology and the interventionalist to get the biopsy moved up sooner. You said in your last post you were praying, if that's ok. Yes, it's ok. Thank you so much. And please also pray they can move the biopsy up sooner. The wait is terrible. Although I do feel a sense of calm hearing the nurse say they are expecting abnormal. Before they kept saying could be fibrous changes etc. but knowing it showed fibrous changes today and the physician doesn't think it's accurate at least makes me feel better in terms of he back and forth in my head. Now, a diagnosis and plan would be great but tonight I'm thankful for what feels like a small amount of insight. Thank you for checking on me.   ",

The GOOD side that had no abnormalities on the MRI. No biopsies done on this side. So why is it pulling in?? Ugh. So much so that my breast isn't smooth/ round anymore underneath. I do have implants so have wondered if it's an implant leaking. My breast seems the same size. Maybe a little more full feeling but nothing major. And it shouldn't be cancer. I mean the abnormalities were on the other side. I posted about this on a separate theead tonight. Thought I would mention here too. No reason to worry right",
