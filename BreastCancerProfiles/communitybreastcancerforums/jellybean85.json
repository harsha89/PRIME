I went to Urgent Care three weeks ago with a terribly itchy and red breast and some puckering, but mostly the itchiness is what made me go in to UC rather than wait a month to get into the Dr. I was (am) going nuts and itching in public is not a good look - but I do it anyway because who can blame someone when they are going crazy?!I've has poison oak, chicken pox, allergic reactions and nothing like this before. Anyway, I went to the UC and they gave me antibiotics and called my Dr. to get me an urgent appointment for the next day. Amazing how they can squeeze you in when another Dr. calls! They are trying to push me through the testing/imaging as fast as they can because my mother, sister, and one grandmother have had breast cancer and my paternal grandmother passed from ovarian cancer at 43. Â I go to a university medical center and a third year checked me out, but called in her attending and he prescribed me hydro cortisone cream and Motrin and told me to come back in 10 days. I lasted 7 and got back into the office. They found a lump and now I have an ultrasound on Tuesday morning. So that's all setup ,but over the past 2 week I have had weird spotting, mood swings, and over the past few days I have had sever acne develop on my chest, shoulders and neck. I never really had bad acne on my face and none of this has started any further up than my lower neck. Has anyone else experienced that with your breast symptoms? This whole thing is making me a beast to live with and my husband is a dear, but I really am trying to be calm. Log in to post a reply",
