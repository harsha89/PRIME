Thanks, Newbie20111 Examples: Recent medical literature has highlighted red rashes which ended up being intradermal ( staph) infections or flat red non itchy rashes which can be cellulitis, or can be an intradermal reoccurrance of invasive ductal carcinoma on the front chest wall. . ( Hard to distinguish between the two). [Staph usually itchy and tends to look like a boil not flat.] Also on Perjeta/Herceptin ...anyone with pin piprick flat birthmarks ( not itchy) ...where they never had them before....( ex. upper arms and on chest in two places) . Also oldage spots on hands and arms if 65 plus. Also anyone dx with cellulitis of the chest while on Perjeta/ Herceptin? Thanks moderators.... Newbie20111 Log in to post a reply",

Anyone can get one, they take time to reabsorb,etc. Some of the descriptions are rather extraordinary and seem like way more than your average seroma.....seems like bad surgery, microbleeds, reconstruction mishaps,etc. Guess there are simple seromas ( those easily drained, or eventually reabsorbed) . Complex seromas...those with large volumes of lymph fluid, microbleeds, reconstruction issues, etc. It would be useful to know whether most seromas are simple or more problematic for the premenopausal crowds, botched surgeries, reconstruction, vs. no reconstruction. When you get one they are kinda creepy, feel like a small silicone implant in the wrong place. For example: I am very post menopausal at 60 plus and I had a very large breast cancer on a large breast and neovalent chemo in right breast and breast and nodes removed. Hardly any bleeding, and no seroma issues. Had radiation after that. Fast forward a year later. Same hospital, same surgeon. Had prophylactic mastectomy, no nodes, extensive bruising ( fingermark bruises ) on chest had a good sized seroma easily drained in breast surgeon office but to this day have slight microbleed discoloration from trauma or perhaps better blood supply or perhaps surgeon used contracted operating help and not as good a job. No reconstruction. (Skin Mets on chest plus local chest wall and subclavian nodes a half a year later after rads and chemo. Seroma side ok. ) . Now NED on Perjeta/Herceptin after doxitacel.

Sort of like an explorer climbing K 2...Or Everest. Some climbers make it, some dont. All make an effort. Even doctors and hospice personnel can't really guess when a person will start the dying process or die. Organizations like Metavivors ( locally started in MD where I live) are trying to use good science and get researchers to focus on the 30 percent of us whose METS cancer gets 2percent of funding...not the C for Cure word, but treatment so we hang around longer and with better quality of life. For example, In 2009 I was dx with microcalcifications that a major university breast center said wasn't cancer but to \"keep an eye on it.\" Fast forward to 2012...Dx with Stage 3 with a humongous tumor in a large dense rt.breast and had port installed. Neovalent TCH and additional Herceptin, Rads, nodes,rt. mast, etc. Lymphedema fall 2012. 2013 Issues with balance etc. because of my uni. NED.....short term memory issues more or less resolved... 2014 June Had propy. left mast, port removed. NED ....Balance great. Breast free great. Got my life back. 2014 Sept -Dec Reoccurrence and Dx Mets: axila lump mets, axila mets,chest wall mets, subclavian all on bc side Jan-March TPH ( doxetaxel/perjeta/herceptin). Finally bought a wig...Makes me look 30years younger! 2015 Clear scans, all mets cleared up first month...Now NED..Continue on Perjeta/Herceptin. Think it was the doxetacel not the PH that worked mostly. Toxic fingers, thin hair, very dry skin, some lower body edema with perjeta, some dumping. Lymphedema some better. Veins on left arm worn out. Port to be installed on Monday. Running out of body real estate.Some PTSD..hardly worked through the 2012 treatment. So what should I expect...My spouse the optimist is shooting for upwards of 10 years. I am facing my mortality and tired of undergoing treatment. My psyche has really taken a hit with this reoccurence which was not unexpected, but really has left me wondering. Have several chemo buddies on their third tour of duty.....some fourth.. How much can a body take..Have a friend with bone mets on a clinical trial getting good results with minimum side effects.. Chemo treatment may be coming out of the dark ages 20th century to the light of day of the 21st century but the cancer within always wins..or something else gets us. Have a friend who is 93 made it through WWII, still living, early melanoma,whose son came back from Viet Nam wounded with friendly fire shapnel and malaria only to have a car wreck on Mother's Day while driving drunk...still living...Had a 90 year old friend whose sister died in the 1918 flu epidemic. Friend died during a nap waiting to go party on Valentine's Day. No cancer, ate horribly. Lived frugally in the house she was born in. Life is for the living. Winston Churchill said \" When you are going through Hell, just keep going\" . Guess that's us! Let's boycott the 5 year rule ..Ha! Let's make up our own rules....Carpe Diem! Seize the Day! We need to be thinking NOW.....That's all we have. Thanks for being here. Family just doesn't get it. Docs really don't know especially with the newer treatments for those with old breast cancers...or oldies with new breast cancers. Turning 65 this year. Doubt I will reach 70. Family members died of old age. Old age ( and cancer treatment) is not for sissies.  ",

Get it checked out, get a second opionion, and if you have cancer treatment expect some pretty radical changes. Be kind to yourself and work with your body. After initial healing seek complementary treatments such as lymphedema therapy,acupuncture, safe exercise and get off the couch, walk the dog, take the stairs, and go live your life.
