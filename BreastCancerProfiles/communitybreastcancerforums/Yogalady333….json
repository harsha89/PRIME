Followup diagnostic mammography and ultrasound also suspicious. My oncologist who is highly experienced does not think it is cancer. He ordered a breast MRI before just automatically having me proceed to a core biopsy. That came out \"highly suspicious for malignancy.\" The oncologist still thinks it is not cancer but possibly fatty necrosis. The suspicious area is adjacent to the original surgery lumpectomy scar from almost five years ago. There has been no trauma recently so wondering why something new would appear in that area. I am not keen about having a core biopsy--would rather have a single needle biopsy or watchful waiting. Has anyone been in a similar situation?",
