Well, I am young, will become 30 yso in couple weeks, no kids. After got diagnosed, i was shocked. No one in my family had BC, and I have 3 aunties, 2 sisters, and 5 female cousins. But I did lived a super stressful life and pushed myself too hard on my study and work. So, probably my body is warning me to stop, and to slow down. My cancer is in stage 1 (less than 2cm), triple +, and the first two ultrasounds didn\u2019t show any abnormal lymph nodes. Well, the latest ultrasound shows one suspect abnormal lymph node, and my surgeon said he will remove anyone that\u2019s tested positive during the surgery. So, fingers crossed. :) I will have my genetic test next week, and finger crossed again. Not yet seen my oncologist, not sure what chemo will be given, or how long it will be given. And still absorbing all the new info and reading articles about BC. So grateful that I have a wonderful husband who supports me and encourages me all the time. Well, let\u2019s fight ! :) Log in to post a reply",

The only thing that's \"unhealthy\" is the stress i put on myself. Well, actually, I am willing to change that, I want to be happy. My husband always says that I don't have to push myself that hard. After I got diagnosed, I started to rethink and look back, and felt that this is a perfect time for me to start a change, to be nicer to myself. I will try my best to stay positive, to fight and to win. :)",
