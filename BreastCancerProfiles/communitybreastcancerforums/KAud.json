So, a regional reoccurance is a possibility. Generally speaking, I think that if it were to come back it would likely do so in a distant organ.  Some stray cells that got out during treatment and decided to be an ass and start a colony on our lungs or liver or bones.  Gotta hate cancer. Hopefully, treatment got them all and we will live long and happily with NED. Karen",
