I was also told the body will eventually absorb the fluid. Regardless, call your doctor. Good luck!",

I had a seroma and cording, but those issues were taken care of.",

I've noticed that once my blood is pumping, my upper arm feels numb and heavy. It's still numb to the touch normally due to node dissection performed a week after mastectomy. I only had 6 nodes removed, and my surgeon didn't seemed concerned with lymphedema risk. My node removal surgery was appx. 6 weeks ago. I need to exercise, but want to be aware of my limits.

There's an area behind the incision that is hard. Is that normal, or could it be an infection? I see my surgeon tomorrow. If its a clot, how would they drain that? I hate the thought of going through more pain.",
