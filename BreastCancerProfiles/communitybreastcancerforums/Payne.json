Am I the only one who is doing chemo before the mastectomy? I was just wondering if it is because of the size when it was found. Also I am only 24 and do not have any kids. One day I would LOVE to have one of my own. My dr has told me it just depends on how my body reacts weather i will be able to have a child of my own one day. Just wondering if there are any women out there who have had a child after chemo. Log in to post a reply",

It was almost the size of an orange when I found out that it was cancer!  However the chemo is working! I go for my 4th treatment in the morning. Id say its shrunk by atleast half! I wish my onc. would have told me about the option to freeze my eggs. It all happen so fast though. I found out that it was cancer on 7-10-08 then had my port put in the very next day and my first chemo session 7-15-08. It was like I had no time to process anything. Im glad to hear that others have had children. Gives me hope that one day I can too.",

Im looking for reconstruction options now. I know that they can do skin and even nipple sparing mastectomy. I will be talking with my dr to see if he thinks those might be an option for me. I do know that I want to have reconstruction done at the same time of mastectomy. I think I will be able to handle the whole thing alot better if I do. I am now looking to find a surgeon. I live in owensboro, Ky so the hospital here does not even do mastectomys. I just want to be able to go to sleep with my breast and wake up with one. So my search for the right surgeon has begun. Any sugestions as to where to search would be great. Wish me luck. And thank you all to take the time to answer some of my questions. :)",
