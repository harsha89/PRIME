Ask your onc about it.  Had heart-lung specialist do procedure.  I send him a Christmas card every year.  Would like T-Shirt for myself, my onc, my lung surgeon, and the Sea Sponge.  \"I can be changed by what happens to me.  I refuse to be reduced by it.\"  Author, Maya Angelou.  Love to all, keep laughing; I don't have to tell you to be strong. Good Luck Hidingfromit.  Thank you Paula from Waco.  I will pray for you both tonite.   OklahomaPaula          ",
