They found a mass and a swollen lymph node they wanted to biospy ( Birad 4a ) I went in later that day for the biospsy. The mass ended up just being a fluid filled cyst- which was great!! Then they took what felt like 100 biopsys of my lymph node, core and needle. I am still waiting for the results and I feel like I am going crazy. I can't stop worrying and crying. I have an almost 2 year old and can't keep but thinking- what if.. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "May 22, 2015 12:32PM - edited May 22, 2015 12:37PM by Ssill Thank you for your support. This waiting is just so horrible. My biopsy was taken Monday afternoon. The radiologist said I should have the results in 2-3 days,  Today is day 4. I have been in contact with my GP and he said that they have not reviewed my case yet. I keep thinking- is that because they found something, had to run more tests and that was the delay in getting the report to the Pathologist to review.... The fact that it is a Lymph Node in question is FREAKING me out.",
