Congrats to those of you who have the end in sight!  Awake at 4:15 this morning!  I should be able to have a relatively normal day today; usually I am down for the count on Saturday for a Thursday treatment.  I have been planning about a week's recovery time for each.  It seems excessive and it isn't that I'm not functional; just need more rest and help with my 19 month old.  I am hoping to shorten that time this round as my Nuelasta is the day after treatment.  Good luck to you all and thank you for sharing your stories!",

Thanks for sharing your stories.  It has helped me to know what to expect from people who have actually been through it.  Hope you are all healing well!",

I had a follow-up appointment with my PS this morning and he removed the pain pump, stripped my drains and gave me a fill.  I would say that I am usually a good patient, but I nearly passed out.  It was embarrassing!  I waited too long to take medicine before my appointment, so it hadn't had a chance to kick in while I was there.  I will definitely make sure I do it right next time.  He didn't clear me for a shower yet, but I am going to see him again on Wednesday for another fill and he will take a few drains out then if he thinks it's the right time.  I have been keeping track of the output.  Thanks for the tip on the ribbon/string.  I will try that when I get the go-ahead for a shower.  Hope you all are doing well!",
