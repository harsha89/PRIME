She suggested that radiation may not even be necessary. They're certain they got all of the cancer since the biopsy of the lumpectomy had no cancer cells in it.  I would be a canditate for the internal SAVI radiation.  I meet with the radiation oncologist tomorrow but would appreciate some thoughts.  I certainly would love to avoid radiation if I can!
