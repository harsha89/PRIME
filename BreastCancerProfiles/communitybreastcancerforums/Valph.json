I am scheduled for a lumpectomy on Friday, and I'm pretty much scared to death.  Everything I read says a fluid-filled cyst that disappears on aspiration is benign - which is what this one did.  But they did a culture, and it came back atypical. I asked the Dr. for some sort of possible diagnosis, and he said intracystic neoplasm.  Anyone ever heard of this, an/or had this before? Thanks for all your great information.",
