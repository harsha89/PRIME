I have IDC and DCIS plus one lymph node out of 25. They did a LND and only one came positive. I noticed you wrote TNBC and Her2+, are you negative on the three? If so, why positive on Her2? I don't mean to be nosy, but it is important for you to know what you have and what medicines they give you and for what reason. We don't want to be doctors, but we do want to have piece of mind and knowing what type of cancer we have, what percentages Ki67, Oncotype factor (I didn't want to wait and went ahead with chemo) will relieve you from anxiety. Just a few suggestions of what to do before chemo, and I am sure more ladies will add to this: Get a flu shot before chemo. Call you MO and ask if you can have one and how close to the first chemo. Go to the other forums and look for how to prepare yourself for chemo, they have a number of suggestions, here in this thread as well. Buy books related to chemo and nutrition. The better you eat, no citric, no tomatoes, no alcohol, no caffeine, the better you will feel. Nothing that bothers your body. Your body will have enough strong substances to deal with, you don't want to stress it more. Decaf Ginger Peach Tea is great for me and helps with nausea. I just feel fatigue. They will give you medicine to prevent any discomfort. When you feel good, don't think you are normal, be careful in what you do. You body will be tired, listen to it. I had my last chemo yesterday, it is a great feeling, you will be there too!",

I started working on week 4 and started Tamoxifen on 12/25. Very tired, is this a SE and what can I do about it? I feel tired, mainly from work driving to meetings back and forth and catching up after four months of being on medical leave. Lots to do and somewhat stressed for being so behind. My hair: they are growing but I don't see a full coverage yet, they strted to grow a week or so ago but again, thin and not the full head. They must be now a quarter of an inch long. I am wearing the cutest wigs and they look so real and always perfect I love them. They are synthetic. My nails: they were dark after chemo 2, like a black shade. I had them cut very small. Now I am leaving them longer and with dark nail polish. A friend who owns a spa gave me organic nail polish and I am using that. They are growing long and healthy! Still not going for manis or pedis. I just got too scared of getting germs from places and my DH actually got Mrsa from one pedi place! That hapenned two years ago, but after that and now my BC I am doing them myself, at least for now until my strength come back. As I said, I still feel tired. My weight: I gained 30 lbs total, between getting the bad news of BC (10lbs), BMX (5-10lbs) and TC (10-15lbs). During the BMX I gained lbs mainly because I wasn't moving, the pain is indescriptible, you ladies know what I mean. Fluid retention is also an issue with the chemo and steroids. During TC I was earing mashed potatoes for breakfast, lots of carbs (noodles, potatoes, bread) that helped with the stomach cramps. I took Nexium and still do, but because of the past ulcers my stomach suffered. Now I am on a diet, only vegetables and fruits with small portions of meats. Nothing fried, no carbs, no sugars. I have lost 7lbs without starving myself. I am still swollen but that might take more weeks? Who knows... My skin: I had dry skin during chemo and for that I used Neutrogena sesame oil after my showers on damp skin. It worked very good plus the smell is very nice. On my face I was washing it and right after I used any face cream I had, still do the same. I still have to ask my MO about Botox but I will see him in two months so I don't have nothing to report on that topic. Oh! I shaved my legs for the first time! Those little suckers grow faster in my legs than in my head! I am using an electric shaver and won't use a razor anymore. I read somewhere that shaving the armpits and using deodorant right after is not good. I am using a deodorant I found that doesn't have aluminum chlorohydrate. The brand is Crystal Essence and has a pink ribbon on the cap. Look Good Feel Better: I went there this past Tuesday and the ladies were great. Lots of freebies and some good make up and tips. I still have my lashes, but they are thinning out. Same with my eyebrows. I am not sure if i will lose them all at week 8 like somebody mentioned, but at least I know now how to do them in case I lose them. TE: I have my exchange scheduled for January 31st and I am thrilled about that. It is so uncomfortable to sleep with the TE and can't sleep on my side, the muscles hurt. Some people say with the implants I will be able to move freely! Well, that is all for now. I will keep reading all your posts and keep us up to date aith your progress!",

Need to take vitamin D for a month, 2000 twice a day, then tests again. This pm went to PS and he was very lleased with the healing, although he told me to not to exercise or move my right arm up (the one with the sutures) for another three weeks. I will see him then. I also asked about the lump I found in my lower ab and I got different answers: hernia and fat. I will call PCP to make appointment and figure put what that is. The three drs. that saw it told me not too worry but i prefer to at least know if it is a hernia. I feel I am finally finishing tests and going back to normal, a normal much better than before, more thankful about all things and people around me. Before I forget: GE told me Advil PM is bad and gives you ulcers! Do not take it! That's all for now, going to bed. Good night!",

My implants are Natrelle 20, 550cc and the muscle pain is terrible. I am taking OxiCodone every 4 hours and doesn't really help. The cuts don't hurt, just the muscle. I am wrapped in a large bandage and I am supposed to stay that way until I see him on Tuesday. Only sponge baths without making bandage wet. Instruction says no lifting and if with OxiCodone, then no driving and not making important decisions. I guess my PS didn't think I would have pain and be able to drive to work, but getting larger implants have made me have a LOT of pain. It is even hard to type. Good luck for the ones getting surgery this coming week. I am positive this pain is worth it. I am on the squishy side now! Yay!",
