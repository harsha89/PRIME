My sister decided to get tested for brca as part of a study that was going on in her area. She is also a bit cancer-phobic. To our shock, she tested positive, I then got tested and am also positive. I was 58 at the time, and never had any cancer. I always did my routine mammograms and gyn exams. Yes, I did have some call backs after the mammos and 2 biopsies in 18 years, but they were both neg. I opted for bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with diep flap reconstruction in Dec. I personally don't have the personality to live with the fear of cancer hanging over my head. I also had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in a separate surgery. Although I am not totally thrilled with the plastic surgeon that did the breast reconstruction, I am thrilled with the fact that they used my tummy fat to make the 2 fake boobs. My tummy is nice and flat for the first time in 25 years. I will go to another PS for my revision. Although I can still get breast cancer because some tissue does remain, the stats say I reduced my risk by 90% and now I can sleep at night! This is a very personal decision. Think long and hard about what is best for you.",

I never had any type of cancer and since I am approaching 60, I decided I am playing with fire (the older any woman gets, the greater the chance for getting breast cancer). The 6 months that passed from the time I learned I had brca to the time of the prophylactic mastectomy (just done this month) were agonizing. All I thought about was BRCA and cancer. I had 4 consults with 4 different breast surgeons and 4 different plastic surgeons. I knew from the start that I wanted diep flap since I didn't like what I researched and heard about implants. The idea of a \"tummy tuck-like\" procedure had great appeal for me as well.  I have been living with a big belly relative to the rest of me all my life. Plus I did not want the \"upkeep\" involved with implants.  I am at home recovering from bilateral mastectomy with  diep flap reconstruction (it actually converted to a free tram flap as the surgeon had to remove a small piece of muscle on 1 side). I did nipple sparing and they are not looking too great at this point..hopefully the survive, but will know more at my post op visit. All I can say is that I am totally relieved that this is history now and that I can recover and move on with my life without obsessing over brca and cancer. Of course, there is a small chance I could still get cancer but it is less than the risk for the average woman (I was told 5% lifetime risk of still developing cancer in the remaining breast tissue, as not every single cell can be removed). I suggest you read up a lot online (there is a lot of information online from the American Cancer Society and the Susan G. Koman foundation, and other reputable sources) and DEFINITELY see at least 2 surgeons for opinions.  All of this will help you make a decision that is right for you. Best of luck with whatever you decide!",

      "Content": "May 29, 2016 06:08AM - edited May 29, 2016 06:09AM by Ramonica60 I am also Ashkenazi Jewish on both sides. Albert Einstein in NY is doing a study and subsidizing the cost of BRCA testing for Jewish women. They are only testing for the 3 mutations that affect Ashkenazi Jews. My sister (being cancer-phobic) went and got tested and came up positive for BRCA 2. The point of the study, I think, is to show insurance companies that testing for all Jews should be covered since 2% of jews have the mutation, and most dont' know it. There is no breast or ovarian cancer in our small family, so this was quite a shock. Ni history of pancreatic, colon or melanoma either. My chances at that point were 50% so I decided to test and also learned I have BRCA2. This happened all within the past 10 months. We both had our tubes/ovaries removed and both had bilat. mastectomies with reconstruction. Unfortunately, my daughter also has the mutation. I still cannot believe all of this happened!",
