This past July I went in for a mammogram and they found a 3cm mass that ended up with my diagnosis of IDC. So I am going through AC-T treatment for that and then then plan was radiation. But I have been limping since May (when I had my mammo, i also had an order for a plan old X-ray that showed nothing) so I finally went for an MRI in October where they are finding bony mets in my hip.. I'm now looking at stage iv breast cancer and my goal of cure has been downgraded to: prolong life. I got my hands on my 2016 mammogram and the CAD had markings for calcification and mass in the area that my mass was found this year. But my report stated: \"no dominate masses\" or \"worrisome clusters of micro calcifications\". What is typical protocol for a Radiologist when these markings show up. Thanks for your thoughts on this. Tina",

So the LVI explains how cancer could spread without the node involvement. I looked it up last night after you mentioned it.. and it all came together. My next question is.... if it is bc... would that be a very quick progression from clean mammogram in 2/2016 to stage iv breast cancer the following year? That just blows me away. Also thank for your kind words about my mil.. my brother in law had stage iii esophagus cancer dx in January as well. So it has been a rough year, especially for my husband. My BIL is now in remission and had the same Oncologist. Hoping he can do the same for me.",

      "Content": "Oct 5, 2017 10:33PM - edited Oct 5, 2017 10:35PM by tina_marie Thank you Deanna.. Well here's my story... In June I went to my regular doctor's office because I had pain in my hip and had been limping for 3 weeks at that time.. but at the same time I was taking care of my elderly mother-in-law in end stages of metastatic lung cancer so I just figured I pulled something. DO (doctors office) gave me an order for an X-ray, but i had to wait another month as my MIL was getting sicker. After she passed I had a day off in early July.. i walked into the imaging center and showed them my order for the X-ray and told them i was due for my mammogram. They saw me and discovered the breast cancer. they said the hip X-ray was fine. So 2 months later after being in the care of my Breast Surgeon and Oncologist.. my Internist decides to call me one day to check in on me and see how i'm doing since he knew what I was going through... I told him good.. managing as well as can be expected, but that I was still limping, even tho the X-rays came back fine.. he told me to give him a half hour so he could check them out again, he'd call me back. a half hour later they wanted to see me the next day for eval, where they set me up for an mri. I got my results of that yesterday the Oncologist and their radiologist tell me the are seeing three areas in the hip that are under 1cm each that are very suspicious of cancer.. biopsy and full bone scan next week. It was the limping that started all this!! I just checked my surgical pathology and it states: size of tumor, GRADE 3 AND Lymph-Vascular Invasion - Present What does that mean?? They told me it wasn't in my lympnodes. Does any of that make sense? ",

This is nice because the MO basically says this is what treatment we are going to do and why... then they set up the teach with the PA to go over all the details. So what I learned about Doxil is it is in the same category of the AC treatment... which I handled very well except for becoming nutrapenic (sp?) where my wbc would drop considerably. This was good news for me because I'm coming off Taxol which I wasn't handling well at all. So today at 12:15 I have my 1st treatment... she said they give me the drip very slow the 1st time to be sure there's no reaction. I told her I was going to take a lorazepam, but she offered to add that to my premeds in the IV.. Good luck with getting your scan's approved...

I didn't hear anything after a day or so, so I called a center here locally that does it and they said that I need a referral for a consult. So I pushed my MO to set up the referral. He said he was \"somewhat doubtful\" that I'd be a candidate, but he'd set it up anyway.. GUESS WHAT? I'm a candidate!! I don't have cancer in any other organ and my liver isn't failing even though it is full of cancer, But they can do it..

What's coming down soon?I have a google alert that i get everyday, but I'm struggling to put it all together... and sometimes understand what i'm reading. I think in spreadsheets (accounting background) and I want to start organizing what is out there. This is important to me, as i am sure it is to all of you, as I keep being told that my MO goal is to keep me going as long as possible to then take advantage of new treatments as they become avail. I am going to be 2 years this summer, I'm doing well and my cancer is somewhat regressing. I would love to hear any of your thoughts on this, thank you!",

She told me this means... there is nothing receptive on the cancer that work's as a beacon to let the immune system know where the cancer is. When I get home tonight.. I'll be able to look up what I was searching for the day she told me about it. ",

I have also traveled to become a patient there as well.. they just wrote out a plan on a yellow legal pad of paper, then handed it to me and said my MO should be doing this. That was it for my second opinion. If things go bad here, i just may ask for another MO down there. I wasn't crazy about this one. Has anyone else made it past 3 years with TNBC?",
