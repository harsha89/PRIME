Before Chemo, they did a PET there was a spot in her bone and they concluded that it was Stage 4 with met to bone. Then Chemo ( 6 cycles ) . She was then put on daily pills ( Tamoxifin) . In the last PET scan , it shows that it has spread to her lung, liver and one more spot on bone. She has wheezing problems due to lung . The doctors are recommending Hormone therapy instead of chemo as they say the life expectancy is the same in both cases ? Any experience would help .. any advise ? This is just so devastating and I dont want to loose my mom..please help .I am sorry for venting Log in to post a reply",
