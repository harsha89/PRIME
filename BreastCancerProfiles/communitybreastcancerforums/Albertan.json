My single mastectomy was about 5 1/2 years ago and I am still bummed. It was my choice not to have reconstruction - totally my choice because I didn't want to undergo more surgery. But I'm a C cup, so I'm pretty lopsided, and there are few prosthetics that will work - the really expensive ones hit a rib or breastbone or something and end up irritating a ligament so much I can't wear them long. So I end up with a very lightweight prosthetic and then end up lopsided too because it tends to ride up. Charming. To hide this, I wear patterned tops almost all the time, because then this lopsidedness isn't so noticeable. The biggest issue? I feel SO unsexy. So unsexy. I can't stand even looking at myself in the mirror after I shower. Still. 5 1/2 years later. However, after reading this forum, I realize I need counselling. I thought all this would go away. But when I hear things like \"every body is beautiful and so is yours\", it just seem so glib. And sorry, but I don't believe/see it. And I am in good health now, so I've got to appreciate that. Thanks for letting me vent.   ",

I just had my first chemo last Tuesday - ended up with such bad diarrhea that I ended up in Emerg on Sat night for 6 hours getting 2 litres of fluids pumped into me for dehydration.  When I checked in with triage this morning they said it looked like they needed to reduce my dosage - but at least it showed the chemo was working!!  Guess that's a better way to look at it.  Plan is to get 4 chemo and then Herceptin for a year due to HER2+ status.  Keep wondering what I'm supposed to learn from all this - but just chatted with a friend who said that that learning comes with time.  Take care, all.  Susan",
