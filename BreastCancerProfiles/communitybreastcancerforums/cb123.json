They have a \"team\" approach going on and work very closely with my each other. They're all in the same building. I met the oncologist today. He did seem upset, I told him that I was remaining open minded this time and had several more tests in mind. He ordered 4 more tests and has referred me for genetic counseling. But the angry facial expressions and the \"Dr Gynecology will tell you the same thing\" attitude was there when I said I would not be having a preventative hysterectomy and would only have medically necessary surgeries. He's a lovely man and if I decide to go with chemo I'll be fortunate to be in his care. I try to be patient with his point of view as I see he is being with mine. My mother had chemo, as did my younger sister. My grandfather chose not to. I'll be making an informed decision based on the information available to me, my specific medical condition and family history. One of the questions I had for him today was \"What is the desired outcome for this chemotherapy plan?\" The answer was, \"To reduce the risk of recurrence.\" With my family history, BRCA positive, and aggressive cancer, I thought reducing the risk of recurrence was not worth the chemo because there will be recurrence. But there are more tests to be considered. One of them will be to determine if I have bone cancer. There's a suspicious looking something on one of my vertebrae. A positive test for bone cancer would immediately change my mind. Thank you again, Gracie. I get a little crass in my speech at times and having this article to share with team will be a big help. cb",

Similar to the other stem cells in our bodies. Current chemotherapies cannot penetrate the stem-like cells to deliver their poisons in the same way the regular cancerous cells are penetrated. So when chemo shrinks a tumor, it's killed a lot of cancerous cells, but probably not many of the stem-like cancer cells. Leaving a larger percentage of stem-like to regular cancer cells in our bodies. There is research from Ohio State University and they are working on this problem. Here's the link: Chitosan-Coated, Chemotherapy-Packed Nanoparticles May Target Cancer Stem Cells Chemo has come a long way with Targeted Chemotherapies. We have a very long way to go with cancer research. Cancer is a tricky little critter and things that work on one cancerous cell may not work on another cancerous cell. While I still believe chemo will not work for me, I still believe chemo will and does work for so many others.

(non-assisted suicide is my choice - we'll see what I can get away with) My family had 5 deaths in 2 years and each one was different from another. Some of the people chose, some had others choose for them and one was unexpected. For me, being in a hospital is just like being in jail, in that your freedom is taken away from you. Simple freedoms, like breathing. If you're in a hospital they make you breathe through a tube. After my double mast, a nurse literally tied my feet to the bed and set the alarm on the bed to make sure I wouldn't try to get up on my own. I could barely raise my head let alone try to move my whole body. It never occurred to this nurse to have the opioid pain medication adjusted so that I could stand up on my own. Just tied my feet to the bed! Hospitals, doctors and nurses are far too extreme for me. I'm much more laid back and carefree and willing to accept the consequences of my actions. For me, QOL means not having to breathe through a tube as I die. I have a horror story about hospitals and my younger sister's death that I'm not sharing on purpose. Please don't think lightly of the examples I gave, they're \"polite\" examples. I think we're very fortunate to be able to choose. cb PS Stephanie, Thank you for sharing the video for Being Mortal. I hadn't had a chance to read the book. I know the story and book were very popular and I'm so glad. I don't think enough people realize the limitations of modern medicine and because of that, they fail to plan. For me, being goal oriented, the death I have planned is just another goal to achieve. Some goals in life I've achieved, some not. My goal in dying is a peaceful death in solitude. Fingers crossed that I do it right and that nobody steps in to muck it up. cb",

This is currently FDA approved and available, you might talk to your oncologist about it. It's just new and I'm not a chemo fan. I think you take it orally, in conjunction with a certain kind of intravenous chemo. I don't know enough about it yet. Here's the link: Olaparib Best wishes, cb",

When you're genetically predisposed to something, you feel as if there's no hope, your fate has been cast and there's nothing you can do to change it. Not just my fate, but the fates of my loved ones. That has been one of the most horrible thoughts of my cancer experience. That those beautiful kids will have to endure this one day. Repairing the DNA gives me hope for all the beautiful youngsters coming up behind me. All the nieces and nephews and grands. I LOVE this approach to finding a cure.
