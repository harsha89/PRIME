I'm usually the one showing the Dr. things that turn out to be nothing.  I'm not used to this.  :)  Now I'm thinking about all the things that could be \"symptoms\".  I'm a little anxious by nature anyway.  lol",

Believe me, that's something coming from this man who obviously doesn't want to give anyone any false hope.  He did go ahead and do the biopsy just in case because he still didn't like something about it, and said he got all of it.  But atleast I have a little more hope now, right?
