Had additional discharge again in Fall of 2003, mammo was normal again.  Had always watched this right nipple.  In the Fall 2006, one day noticed a ' dimpling effect ' near that right nipple where the ' blocked duct' occurred forming mastitis back in Feb 2001.  Dimpling or indentation of skin could imply a mass or tumor pulling etc.  Had a mammo in Nov 2006, turned out to be breast cancer ... IDC  1.3 cm  Grade 1  which is a very slow growing cancer and can take YEARS before showing up on a mammo etc.  The cancer was in the very same area where the blocked duct occured 5 yrs earlier.   It could very well be just a cyst or benign mass, but keep the appt.  I had the same as you from bloody... to leaving a yellowish crusty like residue with my night wear tops.  It also would come and go... and being aware of your breasts... will help esp when you notice something in addition such as a dimpling/indention of skin where something is tugging or pulling due to growth inside. Good luck, let us know how things pan out or if you have further questions. Hug ",

She was a beautiful, loving, valiant woman. Her courage shone out, and we will miss her presence among us. Susan was born in Columbia, S.C., on March 26, 1965, to Tom and Sally Gillespie. Her sister, Emory, was thrilled to have a little sister. Her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins welcomed her into the family. We called her \u2018glad eyes.' In 1983, Susan graduated from Winyah High School in Georgetown, South Carolina, with her beloved classmates. She attended Salem College, where she made life-long friends, graduated in 1987 and was selected as a member of Mortar Board. Susan savored the friendship of her schoolmates and enjoyed working in many arenas including marine biology, interior design and the paper industry. With great joy, she married Tim Elliott in 1990 and treasured the warm reception she received from his family. Tim and Susan had three awesome sons, Austin, Wesley and Julian. Together with Tim, Susan launched several philanthropic projects, most notably a medical relief effort in Kenya through their church and a creative endeavor called Peacehaven, a working farm which will provide permanent homes for adults with intellectual and physical disabilities. Peacehaven will be the future home for their son, Julian. Susan lived a joyful life. Although she had cancer, she showed us all how to live a large life that was loving and generous. She had a great appreciation for nature, gardening, beautiful things, critters, gourmet cooking, travel, art, rock music, fiber arts, sheep raising, beekeeping, mosaics, and liturgical art, and she shared these passions with her children and wider family. While Susan always had a strong religious faith, she found an impressive voice in later years. Through her impassioned speeches and her quiet acts of love, she inspired others to adopt her projects, which, with God's blessing, will continue to be beacons of light in a better world. We, Susan's family, would like to thank Dr. Gustav Magrinat and his staff for all they did to extend her life, giving us many priceless days with her that we will cherish. We also thank Hospice and Palliative Care of Greensboro for helping our family give Susan great comfort and peace in her final days at home. A celebration of Susan's life will be held on Tuesday, September 15, at Westminster Presbyterian Church, 3906 West Friendly Avenue, Greensboro, NC 27410. An inspirational concert will begin at 1:30 p.m., followed by a worship service at 2 p.m. The family will receive visitors after the service in the fellowship hall They request that memorial contributions be made to Peacehaven Farm, P.O. Box 68, Whitsett, NC 27377, http://www.peacehavenfarm.org/ Offer condolences at www. news-record.com/obituaries",

But regarding the TAXOL PAIN  -- boy oh boy did I also have that .... I was able to get thru 4 dd of AC with flying colors and expected a breeze with the TAXOL ....  But after the infusion around the start of day 3 and lasting a good 4 days... I had terrible bone pain in my legs. I too was on the verge of tears... wait I was crying after the first Taxol infusion and experiencing the leg bone pain   ooooooooooooooooo MMMMM   GGGGGGG ..... what did I do .... Percocet helped with the pain  didn't cover it totally but helped..... also many warm, hot baths to soak my legs also helped a great deal. Thes reason why I was able to stop after my third TAXOL is bc I was starting to develop ULNAR NEUROPATHY ....... neuropathy in GENERAL is common with TAXOL ...... and I had that in my hands and feet ...... BUT Ulnar Neuropathy is less common and could be IRREVERSIBLE ,,, and the oncolgist didn't want to risk that with me.  I have no issues now with any neuropathy.... even 3 mths out from TAXOL there was no visible sign of any neuropathy for me. Regarding my FEET and neuropathy -- for me it felt like I was walking on ice cubes ...  BUT if you were to touch them they were NOT COLD........ some ppl have the opposite effect with their feet in feeling like they are walking on Hot Coals.  What helped me with my ice cube feeling feet was to were slip on shoes in the house all the time.... slip on tennis shoes (light weight) shoe worked best for me as I'm a bare foot type of girl in the house.  Oh another help for the feeling of cold sensation feet in BED that helped was to put VASEOLINE on my FEET b4 bed along with socks. Gentle hugs to you -- let us know if you have any other questions.      ",

I had a partial masectomy with my sentinel node removed. At that time the surgeon felt from the appearance and how it felt that it didn't contain any cancer cells in it.  Well about 3days later I get a call from the surgeon -- that indeed that sentinel node DID HAVE CANCER CELLS in it ... macrometasizes and even some extranodular extension ( meaning that cancer cells exploded out from the node)  Because of the postive sentinel node -- surgeon indicated I would need to have further surgery and have more nodes removed and tested...... From all my research, and the fact that my tumor was a GRADE 1 cancer....... I didn't want all my nodes removed out from under my armpit..... because of the increase of developing  lymphedema... So I researched and found that --- we have TWO LEVELS of nodes located under the armpit ..... Level 1  and Level 2 ............  I idicated to my surgeon that I only wanted to have LEVEL 1 NODES removed... and he agreed that would work.  Now  with Level One Nodes typically the average number of nodes found in that fatty specimen that is removed by the surgeon  is 15 average .... some women have 7  some have 20 ... it varies.  My fatty pad of nodes removed had a COUNT OF 21 NODES  found in Level One........ I still have level 2 nodes intact , But I also have mild lymphedema ( LE )...... as you can imagin when the lymph flow circulates through the body and the arm once the fluid attemps to travel up the arm to the armpit -- it gets congested -- like a traffic jam -- not knowing where to flow to since I am short 21 nodes in that area ... grrrr Since the sentinel node is positive in your mother's case --- then chemo is advisable.  I had chemo - radiation -- and now on tamoxifen since the tumor was estrogen positive.  Cirteria for chemo -- is when nodes are positive. hope this helps in some of the questions/concerns you have.  Keep asking the questions... many women are here to assist based on their previous experiences.

Love for others to share their stories when first fitted with glove and sleeve... thank you -- I soooooo didn't want this to happen.. hoping catching the indention effect will prevent this from getting out of hand.... thanks girls Dx 11/20/2006, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 1/21 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The NP went and asked my oncologist .. he steppped inside my room and since I haven't had my period for 3 yrs and typically he will switch women over to AI  after they have been on Tamoxifen for 2 - 3 yrs.  Since I was at 2.5 yrs  he said lets check your hormone levels to make sure u are indeed in MENOPAUSE  ... well the blood work shows that I am  ... big time actually  ... geeez at a tender age of just turning 45 !! lol    The doc typically switches the Tamoxifen users over to Aromasin since its close in the list of side effects  and those who tolerated the Tamoxifen should also do well with the Aromasin .. the other AIs can cause a greater increase in side effects... Aromasin is an expensive pill to take $426 here in WI ... but $15 copay works for me ... only thing I have noticed with this Aromasin in my body is stiff knees if I'm sitting.  No more kneeling  or sitting indian-style -- I'm sure will help that achiness.   and who knows if Aromasin begins to cause more issues  I can always go back to the Tamoxifen ....  ",

I had  IDC ( ductal ) and was able to have a lumpectomy on my right breast and the sentinel node biopsy.  My results also indicated that the cancer cells reached my first sentinel node. I have a GRADE 1 tumor which is slow growing - less aggressive.... but yet found its way to that node.  This was Dec8 2006 ... so I too had to have another surgery to have more node removed BUT the surgeon only removed teh LEVEL ONE Nodes under my pit - since with grade 1 typically you aren't going to see a high number of invasision in the nodes......  ( we have TWO LEVELS of nodes under our armpit- fyi )  Typically the average amt of nodes in LEVEL ONE is 15 nodes  some women have 7  some have 20  -- varies --    I had 21--- yes 21 nodes in that LEVEL ONE --- all NEGATIVE for further cancer spread, thankfully.  I didn't  have this surgery until after Christmas 12/29/2006  - and during this surgery they also placed my PORT in since  with a POSTIVE NODE I needed to have chemo.  I believe that is a good call  -- to have the PORT placed  during that removal of further nodes.  I started chemo 1/23/2007-- finished mid- april,,,, then onto RADS finishing those end of July 2007.......  I did very well with everything -- few issues with the one type of chemo TAXOL -- that followed my AC txs.  Now IM popping my daily Tamoxifen pill - since I'm Estrogen positive......  So since I had that one node positive  -- that stepped me into Stage 2a----  1.3 cm  IDC   Grade 1   es /pr + , HER2 - If you have any further questions please ask -  many gals will be here to assist you and share info and tips...  I healed very well after the further node removal and was back to exercising 10-14 days aft surgery.... Most imp thing with the node removal  is little by little  increasing your full range of movement in that arm ---- Hugs to you ---",

I just don't want to be ' pinching' too much sleeve fabric that it comes back being too tight! So as you indicated, Otter once your sleeve is on..... you really can't ... if you tried pinch the fabric and pull it up off your arm ?? I do have a silicon band at the top of my sleeve, my bio-concept sleeve .. has a seam all the way up from the back side of my wrist, behind my elbow to the top... and pinching at that seam I can gather excess fabric esp staring at the elbow area. This is the beginning area to the shoulder I feel needs to be adjusted tighter .. yet I don't want to pull too much excess....and have it too tight in that area. I am anxious to see my therapist Friday morning and get this resolved.... us girls spend too much time at the appts... and wrapping constantly ... to then have a sleeve be too loose and allow the arm to increase in centimeters........ thanks again .........",

The guideline generally is - for the surgical site to be completely healed prior to starting chemo.  I had 4 dd of AC  and 4 DD taxol... Taxol was added bc of that 1 node being positive  -- all remaining nodes taken on dec 29 were negative. Good Luck with your surgery, and tx plans..... come back often.. and I would highly recommend the chat room - for additional support and tips  - the chat room ladies - are wonderful and got me thru this journey with ease and comfort.
