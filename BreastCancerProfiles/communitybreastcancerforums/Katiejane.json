It kept the area too moist and would cause the top layer (or 2) of skin to come right off leaving raw areas.  I found a product, Pure Emu Oil that worked wonders!!!  It penetrates 3 cell layers deep which promotes healing.  My Rad Onc, Surgeon, and Oncologist are really impressed with the way I have healed and the lack of scarring. I still use it on my bilat. mastectomy scars and the skin that had broken down with Rads. that is now healed with no scars.  Everyone seems to have their favorites and I did try several different products.  Good luck in your search.",

I immediately went to my surgeon, totally freaked out that the Ca had returned. It was an enlarged node that I have since learn to drain with massage.  It was clogged and in-turn filled with lymph fluid.  It was firm to the touch but moved around alot(was not fixed to one spot). My cancer side also had lumps under my arm. They were as hard as a rock and did not move when I touched them. Also, they were not tender to the touch as the other node was. I would get in to see my surgeon if I were you but please try not to panic.  I know this is easier said then done!  As far as the IV'S go, I had anesthesia put mine in my neck just to avoid all arm punctures.

Anything I can do to manage this mess I am more than willing to do but the lack of available treatment facilities makes me feel like I'm beating my head against the wall!!!!

When I removed the sleeve it was a bright reddish pink with spots that pretty much covered my entire arm. So I headed to the ER and they stared me on IV Ancef. I was allowed to go home but had a saline lock so that I could administer my own IV meds every 8 hours for 5 days. When the IV meds were done, I started on oral Keflex for another 5 days. You definitely need to be checked by a doctor and see your Le therapist. Do not treat this lightly as it can spread very quickly.  Hugs!  Katiejane",

My question is--is this a running IV injection, is it just a needle/syringe injection into a vein? I have already told them it can't be my arms(bilateral LE) and I need lidocane for a foot stick. I was told they will not use lidocane as it causes the veins to constrict but that they work with cancer pts. all of the time and not to worry, they'll find a place to inject me!! Well, that put me off just alittle and I am concerned!!!  Anyone ever have this done?? Where did they inject you and how much fluid was injected? Is this a radioactive solution?

I was told to wrap and leave it on day and night for 2 days and then remove it to check skin, circulation, etc.  I also suffer with carpal tunnel syndrome. Is it alright to wear the CT night brace over the wrapping???  Also, should I have night arm garments to wear after I get the swelling under control in my arm?  What are the best night garments? One more question?  Has anyone heard of a compression sleeve made in Australia-maybe called \"new skin\"? They are supposedly made from a much lighter, more breathable fabric and the elbow area has an added piece so that it's not tight and leaving creases in your LE.  Thanks!  Katiejane",

Much to my objections, she wanted me to use Estrase Vag Cream, .5-1 gram every other day for 2 weeks. This is suppose to help things heal and stop the erosion. It was either use it or loose the sling..   This will be the only time I will use this product.  With this chemo brain I now have, it just dawned on me that maybe the estrogen in the cream is causing the fluid retention??  I remember retaining 3-5lbs of fluids with every monthly cycle.  Any feedback?    Thanks,  katiejane",

They even allowed me to position my arms and neck before they knocked me out. IV was started in my foot (temporary) so that I could be put to sleep when another IV was placed in my neck.(the foot access was d/c'd.) Now that I'm 2.5 weeks out from surgery, my LE has started to swell more than it has in a very long time.  I have continued with my massages here at home and with my therapist. Nothing has changed other than my activity level. I really believe this may be the cause of this flare up but it scares me just the same.  Does anyone have any other ideas as to why I might be swelling?  Thanks for any input.    katiejane    P.S.   All bp's were taken in my legs.

I have seen 2 different Ortho's regarding the pain and possible surgery to repair my rotator cuff. I also spoke to my surgeon who did my DIEP and lymph node transfer. One surgeon said it wouldn't be a risk to have surgery or and injection, one surgeon said no way-he would not do surgery or an injection, and my reconstruction surgeon spoke to many Ortho's in her area and all said they would never do either procedure on a LE patient--period! I have chosen to live with the pain and limited use of my arm. Unfortunately, if I over use my arm it swells from the shoulder inflammation on top of my LE swelling. Kind of a no win situation but I have accepted it and moved on. Just another gift from the cancer journey! I wish you well and please let us know what you decide and the outcome! Best of luck!!!

I have no problem with a flat chest but my cloths do fit differently. People who haven't been through this can't understand why I have chosen not to do reconstruction.  Many don't understand that implants aren't just a 1 time surgery.  For me, comfort is the name of the game! Who knows, maybe down the road I'll stuff some tissues in my prosthesis bra!
