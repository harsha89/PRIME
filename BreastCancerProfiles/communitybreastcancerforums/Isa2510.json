The doctor told be they were fibroadinomas and very common in young girls. I was relieved. I have about 6 of them. Five in my right breast, and one huge one in my left. My grandmother had breast cancer, so of course I had to get sonnagrams and core bilateral biopsies done. They're all benigne, however after seeing a sergeon, he suggested that I remove two of them. The one to be removed on the right isn't too much of a concern to me. It's only around 1.5cm. The one on the left however is really big. Inches big. And I have a small chest to begin with. Only a 32B. I'm terrified that having this removed is gonna leave me with a three inch scar and a deformed, uneven, chest. It really does take up a good portion of my boob. Will the breast tissue \"fill itself back up again\"? How long would that take? Or will I just have a huge indentation in my boob? I'm also afraid that they'll come back and that these lumps, as well as my genetics, will make me more prone to getting cancer when I'm older. Can anyone who's had this operation done give me some insight on what I'll be dealing with afterwords? Is it possible that they'll just grow back? Will my boob be \"deflated\"? Does this increase my risk to getting cancer? Thanks in advance! ~IsaÂ  Log in to post a reply",
