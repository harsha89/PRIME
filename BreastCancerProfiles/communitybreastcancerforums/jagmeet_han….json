Thanks a big ton! It is you and Linda and others in the forum that show us light at the end of the tunnel. I wish and hope my Mom gets through this ugly phase too... But, I ask for an apology, for what I mentioned was from the article I provided the link for and not my own words or research. However, besides that I did mention what we tried and what helped us. Like you say, \"Eveyone should do what suits them the best\".  Regards, ~ Jagmeet ~ ",

The doctors said surgery and chemo went fine and her health is ok too :-). She would have to go through some more regular check-ups in coming weeks. Just wanted to know what kind of regular checks are you or your contacts following after chemo, like yearly or monthly. I hope everybody is doing fine here and thanks again for all the support.

      "Content": "Aug 31, 2009 01:58AM jagmeet_hanspal wrote: I read your post in the morning but it took me some time to reply. I have put my answers to your questions below and tried NOT to miss anything important. Ques: What all problems your mom faced after mastectomy? Ans: Well, I would say our doctors were very supportive in this regard and surgery was our first priority too, as we wanted to get the tumor removed at the earliest before the malignant cells start spreading into the rest of the body. The doctor provided all the medication needed for recovery, and we were given enough time before the Chemo would start. The doctors advised the food/drinks pre and post surgery and the hospital took care of it. We were really appalled when my mother was brought out from the operation theater and the recovery unit after the surgery. She was all drowsy and would throw-up due to all the anesthesia and suffered pain in the operated areas and around. There was discomfort for sure, but the pain-killer and other medication really helped. They had a small plastic bag attached through a long pipe to the operated area for draining out the unwanted fluid and blood. It had to be washed daily and compressed to generate vacuum for sucking out the unwanted liquid from her body. Someday a damaged/cut nerve/vein would get sucked in the pipe and would have to be removed manually, but doctors said it was nothing to be worried about, although it was upsetting. She was bed-ridden for 2 days and the docs advised not to lift anything heavy from that side of the body. Also avoid taking Blood-Pressure measurements on the affected arm or administering any injections on that particular arm. Another extremely important point, which Linda and our doctors suggested was the exercise for preventing Lymphedema. During the surgery a chemo-port was implanted in my mother's body which is really helpful for administering the Chemo-drugs to the body. My mother was advised not to sit idle considering herself sick when she was discharged. Besides proper rest, she was told to do her regular work but just prevent heavy work and strictly avoid getting any kind of infections... Also, after the mastectomy, my mother had started the Ayurvedic alternatives, so that really helped in recovery too... And, steadily in about 4 weeks she was healed enough to get started with the Chemo-Therapy. Mastectomy was important and inevitable. Ques: Where in india are you going for alternative medicines? Ans: We consulted the \"Swami Ramdev\" centers for the Ayurvedic medicines as an alternative treatment. These centers are very popular now-a-days and you should be able to find one in (or near) your town too. This was besides the surgery and Chemo-therapy that our oncologist had suggested. A positive frame of mind, with regular yoga helped us tremendously. They also suggest the food/juices and other things that help maintain a healthy body. The consultation is free and they only charge for the medicines/potions and tonic, that you buy from them. Very Very helpful. Although the person whom we met in the Ayurvedic center was quite young (and seemed naive) and we didn't know whether we could trust him, but we realized they had standard-package for cancer and other diseases, which mostly consisted of health potions/herbs etc and certain other medicines, and they would modify it based on the patient's condition, state, stage and preferences. Ques: Where do you reside in india if at all and where did you get your mother operated? Ans: We got all the diagnosis, surgery, chemo-therapy (still continuing) from Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi. We didnt want to take any chances with such a disease so wanted to go for the best that was available. Also the medical insurance helped us offset the cost of treatment. We reside in Faridabad, its a satellite town to New Delhi. This forum has a lot of information, helpful members and personal expereinces which is indispensable. You can also post the FNAC/Mammography reports and PET scan reports, if that has already been done, and check with other members who had similar diagnosis and what kind of treatment they followed.  I wish you a lot of courage and good luck.  Best Regards, ~ Jagmeet ~",

Tiny sclerotic focus noted in the left sacral ala likely bony island. Rest of the bones under survey appear normal and demonstrate no abnormal FDG uptake. PET CT scan findings are suggestive of FDG avid multifocal parenchymal lesions in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast with FDG avid right level I axillary lymph node. No scan evidence of FDG avid disease noted elsewhere in the rest of the body surveyed. Overall PEt CT scan findings are suggestive of Stage II A (T1c N1 M0). Please correlate clinically. I think the PET CT legend (T1c N1 M0) summarizes it all, and I am going to take the doctor's opinion on this tomorrow and get my mother admitted and oprerated upon asap. I am really happy that I found this forum and the right people all the way till now. I hope everything will be fine and she gains her good health again. Regards, ~ Jagmeet ~",

As noted, this was, but, an alternative track, a parallel track. The main track being what the doctors/oncologists suggested. However, there are certain natural/herbal things that are good even for an otherwise healthy person. Things like Neem, Tulsi, Jowar, Aloe Vera, Ghiya (Gourd)  can be taken by anyone, it just helps anyway, not specific for cancer. So we had chosen from the list the ones that are but health/energy or immune boosters. As we know the immune system, besides other dynamics, is the one that suffers tremendously from the harsh Chemo drugs. And most of these we could grow at home just to avoid getting adulterated/inorganic food from market/ayurvedic center, which is very very common here in India.  And, I am sorry, I didnt want to annoy your belief system. Even I shared your perspective before this happened to us, however, I just wrote here what helped us. Even the doctor seemed surprised when my mother went for her first chemo-session that she had recovered so well and had that glow on her face which not even some healthy people have (touch wood). But, anyways, everyone is free to choose. There are other sites which say about \"curable cancer\" like Munir Khan's CancerCurable.com and others that try to cure it through balancing the pH of the body or even through Reiki and distance healing. But, what matters is what helps particular patient. Each diagnosis and prognosis is different and even for oncologists today, adminitering the quantity of medicine is selecting a particular medicine is a \"statistical\" process. Oncologists have annual meetings where they disucuss the improvement in the results by changing one out of many factors that affect, and then follow the new model for treatment, only to come back the next year with the new results. What I mean is there is no sure-shot way, \"yet\". I even provided a link to an article which stated that whole BC thing is a scam as you are deliberately scanning over 2900 women and exposing them to X-rays to save the life of 1. And even that survivor does not lead a normal life as she is undergoing chemo or radiation and having all those Chemo/radiation adverse-effects.. Somebody researched this and posted it here: http://www.naturalnews.com/026536_cancer_brst_cancer_cancer_patients.html However, thanks for the link. I think we will contact her too. Anything to help her get better. This forum is wonderful. :-) Regards, ~ Jagmeet ~",

Towards the end some reports suggested HER-2 positive so I had asked doctors why could/should we not start administering Herceptin. But in 2015 she had become too weak so doctor did some risk-analysis and administer a variant of Herceptin (from Biocon labs). In retrospect, I am not sure why the recommendations from doctor for Hormonal tests were so delayed in treatment (they got done only during re-occurence) while the doctor's protocol remained focused on surgery and chemo-therapy earlier (don't even have a count of number of PET scans and chemo-sessions now she had to undergo). Now that I read this thread back from top, I see the comments from Eldub (Linda) mentioning HER-2, but we were too stressed following our doctors prescriptions and treatments (and also quite relieved with the 2009 treatment results) and thought she was getting better and going to be fine (she did remain happy and healthy and everything was ok after 2010 until 2015 when BC re-occured with a vengeance) and then lost her.",

Also, we are still following standard treatment protocol for my mother, and whatever our oncologists suggest. I think that's the best bet too, and \"alternative\" is still an alternative. However, one fundamental difference is while \"standard treatment protocol\" focusses on tearing the body down to \"treat/kill\" cancerous cells, the \"alternatives\" focusses on building the body up to \"cure/prevent\" cancer.
