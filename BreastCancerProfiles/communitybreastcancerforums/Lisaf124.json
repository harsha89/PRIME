During the surgery they biopsied my sentinel lymph node, and they thought it appeared clear. After pathology reports came back it had a trace of cancer. So that sent me to Stage 1b or early Stage 2. I am very nervous. My team has decided to give me 12 weeks of Taxol with Herceptin and Perjecta every 3rd week. I will then follow up with 6 weeks of radiation. I am triple positive. As I have been reading various blogs, I am always worried if this taxol will be strong enough to rid me of this cancer. I am handling taxol fine, except for fatigue and diarrhea. I will have my 6th treatment of Taxol this week. Hair was thinning a lot during week 4 so I just got it buzzed. Wondering if that was the best decision because a I read, some warriors have not lost hair with Taxol. Once mine started coming out in the shower, I just wanted it out. I would love to hair/hear from some of you. Pretty lonely feeling. Thank you! Good luck to all of you.  ",
