I will have a BMX and axillary node dissection on June 26th. You are all in my prayers and please include me in yours. I know how scary surgery is and recovery is tough, but you will come out of this experience stronger and with more confidence than ever before. My biggest piece of advise to you is to get to physical therapy as soon as your surgeon will allow. It will be a turning point in your recovery. Hugs",

I have had radiation and it was not bad at all. I wanted to let you know that I had one of my drains taken out yesterday and it was a breeze. I was scared to death, but it was no big deal. I am sorry you are sad and crying, but I think it is better to let those feelings out. It is great news that you have good friend and family support. You should consider adding a counselor to that team. I did with my first dx and it was very helpful. I am praying for you.",

I went to a lymphedeema specialist prior to surgery because I wanted to be fitted for a compression garment so that I could nip it in the bud if it showed up. She explained that swelling in the first six months post surgery is not lymphedeema, she completely put my mind to rest on this issue this time around. Once I get cleared for PT by my PS, my PT will monitor me for the condition. Having said all of that, I would still mention this at your appt Monday. I hope this makes you feel a little better.",

You need to be able to rage if you want to with someone trained to handle it and guide you through it. In an earlier post I said my biggest piece of advice was to get to physical therapy as soon as possible; I think speaking with a mental health professional is also very important.
