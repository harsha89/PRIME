When did you start your chemo treatments? I hope you\u2019re feeling better today",

I usually go to their houses but now I have asked them all to come to my house and they cancel if they think they are bringing germs in. I have each student sanitize hands b4 the lesson and I wipe down the keys a lot. And I have used clorox wipes on door and cabinet knobs. We have children ages 6 and 12 and I am sure they will be bringing stuff into the house once \"sick\" season goes into high gear. Am I too cautious?",

I've been trying to live a \"normal\" life inbetween AC #2 and #3 - squeeze in housework, family time, teaching piano lessons and a lot of make-ups. And the weather in Philly was nuts for a while - kids were home A LOT from snow and holidays. I got my hair buzzed by my hairdresser last Friday. She didn't charge me for that or when I had my hair cut super short right before AC #1. I watched a bunch of videos on how to tie a scarf and I've been having fun with that. My friend gave me a few bamboo soft caps to wear to bed or as a liner - they are super comfy; I had some razor stubble for about a week - I guess there were some patches that just didn't want to give it up. #2 was hard but a little better than #1 because they made adjustments. Unfortunately I lost 7 pounds again and have only gotten back 2 so far. I've had to keep an eye on constipation - colase and milk of mag. seems to help. The other day I was really backed up and when I pushed, a bulge popped out of my stomach - almost like a knot of muscles. It was really scary. I was able to massage it back in. Called doc - they weren't concerned b/c I had no other symptoms. Muscles tender for a few days. Haven't worn my wig yet in public. Just not feeling it - doesn't really look like me. I had a LOT of hair before. I am blessed to have a job that everyone has been super-supportive and non-judgemental - so I can be pretty open about it. My 6 YO was pretty frightened by my bald head but she INSISTED on seeing it. She loves to have me read Chemo Cat, My Mother Has Cancer, Polka-Dot BooBoo and Nowhere Hair. When I think of #3 coming up on Wednesday I get so sick to my stomach. ",

I'm having a port installed on December 21. I wasn't worried about it until I started reading some of the posts. We bought our plane tickets to visit family in Nicaragua this upcoming February (12 days) before I was diagnosed. We have trip insurance But I'm really hoping we don't have to use it. I'm hoping the side effects won't be so bad. My oncologist seems to think we can time the treatment so I can make the trip assuming I don't have any allergic reactions. I wonder if others have had allergies to the meds? Also, I'm just getting my bearings after surgery and helping my children ages 6 and 12 to cope when my roller coaster is down. I'm wondering if you go alone to chemo? Bring spouse? Friend? My right breast (reconstructed using free flap from abdomen) is definitely larger than left breast. Plastic surgeon tells me she does that to allow for shrinking from radiation and will do a revision 6 months later. I think it is causing muscles in shoulder blade to spasm.",

It is to raise white blood cell count what causes bone pain, so they told me to take Claritin. They also told me to take Pepcid AC to help with acid indigestion. Within about 5 hours the nausea sudden and by 8 o\u2019clock I had to take Compazine... made me drowsy but didn\u2019t help the nausea. I took Zofran and that helped a lot.

I got some pretty knit hats that my friend's mom made for me and they had PILES of free knit hats at the chemo place (made by a knitting circle) - I took one with Christmas colors - really cute. I figure that I will get buzzed as soon as I can after it starts to fall out. I can't bring myself to do it sooner. I have really thick hair.

I was really down under for the first 6 days, first physically and then emotionally/mentally. The overall experience getting the chemo treatment was okay. I was really creeped out by the Adriamycin, though; The nurse had me suck on ice the whole time while it was being pushed (directly into my port and not through the drip). It is to constrict the blood vessels in mouth to avoid sores. Next time I will bring pops with me. I opted for Benedryl pre-med which really helped me a lot. Cytoxin gave me an immediate headache. As I was leaving, the nurse told me not to bother taking Zofran until 8 AM day two, but nausea started five hours after drip. I took compazine, but that didn't help much, just made me tired. Three hours later still suffering...took Zofran at 11 pm (helped a lot, but then after that not as much), Other SE:dizzy, weak, fatigue, pounding headaches, nerve twitches, bone aches (especially in ribs - from the Neulasta patch). I took claritin for 6 days to offset the patch. I also took Pepcid AC for 4 days. Most foods gave me acid or regrets. Hard to find things I could eat or drink: here is my \"good\" list...dry toast, orange, avocado, unsweetened apple sauce, cheese sticks, chocolate sea salt popsicles from WF. Most things I would only eat one or two bites. I lost 6 pounds in 5 days. My DH prepared so many different foods out of the Cancer Fighting Kitchen to try to get me to eat. I spent a lot of time in bed listening to religious choral music - it really soothed my soul. End of day three I was craving a mint milkshake and I downed the whole thing and felt SO much better. Day 4 I was eating hummus and carrot sticks! In general I was afraid if I ate more than a few bites I would throw up, but I never threw up. Thank you Hariry for the recommendation to use cold compresses; that was one of the most helpful antidotes for the nausea and overall bad feelings - I kept a rag by my bedside the whole time. Also Xanax helped me to sleep and when I had a meltdown on day five. Overall I slept really well. but when I was awake it was rough. Day 4 I felt a bit better but headaches were really bad and it was Christmas, so the oncologist on call (not my regular doc) had me go to ER. They did CAT scan, blood and chest X-ray because I had pain in my bones. My WBC was up to 32K which is REALLY high. normal range is 3-10K. Mine was 5K the day of infusion. My MO thinks the headaches are from the Neulasta patch. They gave me a patch bc it was a holiday weekend - usually you go back the next day and get a shot and they will adjust the dosage; she said the patch is \"one size fits all\" - it did NOT fit me.... Also, she said they will adjust the pre-meds and steroids in the drip. I went to acupuncture on day six and I went again today. My friend had bilateral and said that this really helped her with chemo SE. One terrible SE for me was on days five and six I fell into a terrible funk - yelled at my kids, hung up the phone on my sister and stayed in my room with shades drawn feeling hopeless and wanting to give up. I felt scared and alone and terrified of going back for another round. I even considered trying to find another MO who would tell me I didn't need to to any more Chemo. It was a dark place. I am happy to say I am feeling strong again and ready to enjoy these next days before round two. Trying to focus on the positive, the love, the prayers and trying to stay close to God. Thank you ladies for all of your entries. I read each one with love and care and wished I could join in the discussion, but I just didn't have the energy or peace of mind to respond. Laura",

My nurse said that sometimes they are defective, but you would know because the green light would stop flashing or something. IDK, I feel like there are so many variables. I think it is worth asking.

So now I mostly just wear the cap because I get them about 10 to 12 times a day and I get so sweaty! Then a few minutes later I'm very cold... and put on a sweater and then about an hour later I'm burning up. So crazy; But I'll take this over nausea any day! I've been getting constipated and pain with stools- I wonder if this is the Taxol? Did anyone else get this SE? I think I'll start taking colase. I started to get a rash on my cheeks - it sort of looks like acne. Also I'm a lot thirstier and my fingertips are all dried out. Daniz- I'll bet the headaches are from Taxol. I'm not taking steroids except with premeds. I got lay-in-bed-all-day headaches with Taxol #1 on days 3 and 4. I haven't done anything about fingernails... just hoping I'll be lucky and not have to deal with it. My energy is finally back. Unfortunately i've been getting sharp shooting pains in my surgical arm. I was discharged from PT last Wednesday and now I'm getting pains. I'm terrified of getting lymphedema since I had nine lymph glands removed and I am at risk. I have Taxol this Thursday and I feel much stronger about it ... notnearly as anxious. Hi Hariry! Nice to be back! I like the way the wig looks for me but it makes me sweaty and itchy if I have it on too long. I\u2019ve even pulled it off my head in a restaurant twice...I was so hot.... I\u2019ve just gotten to the point where I don\u2019t care anymore what I look like; I just want to be comfortable.  ",

In the end we postponed one week and I went in this past Wednesday. I\u2019m taking B6 and L glutamine and I did icing on hands and feet. I just think it\u2019s so weird they didn\u2019t recommend that to begin with. So far the neuropathy seems to be staying the same and not getting worse. I think I\u2019ve been very lucky with the white counts. When I started chemo they were pretty low around two. But they gave me the Neulasta shot each time and it\u2019s been holding steady around seven. Also I don\u2019t do any of those oral steroids. Just Decadron in the drip premed Not sure why it\u2019s different... I guess different docs two different things. I\u2019m so over this chemo. I completely forgot to take the Claritin yesterday and all of my bones are hurting. Also I stopped taking the Prilosec and Pepcid AC thinking that that was more for the AC treatments. Now I am suffering terrible acid reflux. So I\u2019m going to go back to taking all those drugs again. I have one more treatment on April 12. Feels good to see the light at the end of the tunnel. JVP - i\u2019m so sorry that they sent you home and you had to postpone your treatment. What a bummer. Hang in there everybody. Sending you all big hugs. Laura",

And, I too started to eat on the same day you did and also scared it wouldn't stay down. We are just a week apart and so much in common. I too lost 6-7 pounds in just 5 days, but I have gained 3 pounds back eating milkshakes lol! Hang in there...it really gets better. Also, the first round is really the worst from what I hear, bc your body is shocked and you don't know what to expect, how much to take and when and what works and doesn't work and the docs have to tweak things. The only reason things are \"cumulative\" is not bc the meds build up, but because your body gets weaker from the treatments. And, this means that the meds are working. I admire you for posting even when you were feeling so awful. I wish I had posted, maybe I wouldn't have gotten so depressed. But the headaches were so bad, I couldn't even look at a computer screen. I have felt so great since Friday. Full of energy and getting things done. Enjoying my children and DH. Now I am watching comedies. I read that laughing is really good for the healing process - good belly laughs! I hope you had a good day. Laura",

I had shrimp and broccoli and wonton soup and it was the best feeling being able to eat hot yummy food and the broth felt very nourishing. I think I had the same kind of Neulasta patch that you did. It was on a timer and it went off 24 hours after the infusion. It's a 45 minute release and then you're supposed to take the patch off . I was so doped up on Benadryl after my drip that when they gave the exit instructions to take the patch off I wasn't sure if I had heard it right, so I didn't take it off until another day later when Ibspoke to the on call\u2013 I wonder if that's why I got such a bad headache? I'm interested that you're getting bloodwork a week after your first infusion. The only reason I had blood work done on day four with because I went to the ER. But there was no schedule a follow up to get blood work done. Now I'm wondering... is it standard procedure to get blood work done a week after? I thought they just did it the morning of the infusions",

      "Content": "Dec 18, 2017 03:26AM - edited Dec 18, 2017 03:31AM by Laura644 Hi Daniz1983, I'm pretty new to this site. I didn't even sign up for BC.ORG until two months after my diagnosis. I have an annoying pathology story. Took several weeks before I got my HER2 status: First sample was 2+ equivocal. They re-tested it with FISH analysis and it still came back equivocal. My oncologist ordered a second tissue sample and requested that the testing will be done by a different lab. She was hoping that it would come back HER2+ so they could use herceptin and do chemo first to shrink p the tumors. But it came back negative and so MO and BS decided that surgery first would be best. After surgery I asked MO if they could retest my HER2 status with the tissue samples from my surgery and they said Insurance probably would not pay for that because the 2nd lab result was considered definitive. For anyone who's interested in my story... I feel like I need to get it off my chest tonight. I found a lump in my right breast on August 30th. I immediately went and got a mammogram and sonogram. I'm 45 years old. I was scheduled to get my first mammogram done this summer on July 11. I fell on the way to the hospital and broke my left foot. I took a wheelchair to get to the mammogram. They told me I would have to stand for the mammogram and I said I can't stand. They told me I should probably go to the ER instead. Looking back, I'm glad I didn't get my mammogram that day. My husband was out of the country for five weeks. I think it would've been devastating to have gotten this diagnosis during that time when he was away. The next day I went to a breast surgeon who biopsied my right breast and axillary gland. She sat me down and looked at the mammogram with me. She showed me thousands of white dots on the screen for my right breast ( they were only a few calcifications in the left breast and so she was not concerned with left breast) and explained that although she would have to wait for lab results to confirm, she said that it looks like cancer, and that my whole breast was filled with disease and that I would have to have a mastectomy. On September 5, she called and said that the results came back for the right breast (IDC) but not the axillary gland. She also told us that the HER2 status was equivocal and that they would have to do a FISH analysis. Three days later she told me that the results for the axillary gland had come back with the original report and that the axillary tissue sample had been mislabeled as \u201cright breast\" and that the axillary had IDC as well. This made sense to me because on the lab report there were two sets of results and they were both labeled \u201cright breast\". On Friday, September 8 I had a breast MRI and pet scan- BS called me that evening to say pet scan showed cancer in right breast and axillary gland and a spot on the abdomen and MRI had some suspicious areas in left breast and so she ordered a breast MRI biopsy. The following Tuesday I had genetic testing. On Wednesday I went in and had the MRI biopsy on my left breast. It was excruciating and scary and I almost had a panic attack I wish they had told me to take Xanax before hand. I was lying facedown with tears and snot falling directly below. I felt so humiliated. There were four people in the room with me. One of the nurses kept rubbing my back and assuring me but I was doing a great job. It seemed like I was in there forever. They took two samples. When they shot some sort of medicine in the my left breast, it went so far through that I cried out in agony; I was whimpering and shaking . I had bruising and a hardness in that spot for a month and a half. I could barely get up afterwards. The nurse had to apply deep pressure for at least 15 minutes afterwards to stop the bleeding. They put cute little pink ice packs, taped onto my breast. Then they did another mammogram. Then they took me to the biopsy room where they did an ultrasound and another tissue sample from my right breast so that they could do another HER2 test. I was pretty knocked out and exhausted. I have been in radiology for five and half hours. We went to lunch and then met with the plastic surgeon that afternoon. It was really rough day. ",

I am a pianist and I played for a Christmas concert last night and have been tied up with rehearsals (a welcome distraction). My MO had originally said we would start AC+T 5 weeks post op, but I really wanted to play the concerts for my daughter's school and it would have overlapped with treatments. She said it was fine to delay chemo until 8 weeks post op. I had my port installed today. It is achy and feels like I have metal weights on my bone and it really hurts when I sneeze. Weird....I remember talking to the doc the whole time during the procedure, but now I can't remember a word of it, LOL. Even the bags of frozen peas hurt:( Tomorrow is my first treatment. When I was diagnosed in Sept, my hair was 3/4 the way down my back. I had it cut shoulder length in October before surgery. Yesterday, I got a pixie cut - got a lot of compliments, except my 6 year old daughter, \"mommy, you look like a BOY!\". I figure I won't feel so shocked when it all starts falling out.Last night I started to feel nervous about it. I keep reading everyone's posts to see if I can predict when I will feel lousy. I guess it's just wait and see. I am worried that I will be in really bad shape for Christmas.",

The MO had me come in so they could look at my mouth to see if it was thrush. The PA counted 12 sores in the back of my throat. I used Magic mouthwash which helped a bit, but there were some sores inside of my lip and cheek for which I used kanka - that helped keep me sane. I also ate soft and liquid foods for a while. And they told me to stay on Prilosec and Pepcid every day, period. Anyway, I was surprised that I had pain with swallowing after Taxol #1(feb 23). I have to stay away from spicy and citrus. Usually a glass of milk or yogurt will help me neutralize the pain.",
