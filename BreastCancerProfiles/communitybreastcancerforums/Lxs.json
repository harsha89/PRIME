I do have pain for the times it comes out and goes back in, best way to describe it would feel like im being stabbed from the inside out through my nipple and they pull it back in, it\u2019s such a sharp pain. I told my dr at my physical and she looked and did an exam and she sent me a referral to the breast clinic. I had my ultrasound done at the imaging center Friday. Said my dr would have results on Monday, the latest Tuesday. The ultrasound was quick, I noticed she spent more time on one specific area. Anyways I was curious as to what it would look like since the only ultrasound I have seen were from my pregnancies. I looked up and noticed a small area that a bit of flashing in red and blue. I may be wrong but isn\u2019t it the blood flow? I used to see a prenatal cardiologist and that was always what they would point out. Anyways she took the pics and told me she would have the radiologisr confirm It was enough, came back and said it was enough and. Told me she was sending the results. IM in the waiting game now but I\u2019m really worried. My husband keeps reassuring me that if it were anything serious they would of told me then and there. I slightly disagree because I don\u2019t feel the imaging center isnt the best place to tell you since they have to see a few people a day, makes more sense to have your dr who order the test to go over results. Does anyone have an idea what the blue and red could mean? Has anyone had an ultrasound with that on there or experienced similar changes like I have? Thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",
