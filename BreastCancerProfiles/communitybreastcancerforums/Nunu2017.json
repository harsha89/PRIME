    "Content": "Nunu2017 wrote: My mammogram showed architural distortion. I was told I need a MRI. I went to another radiologist for second opinion and they said I need another ultra sound and biopsy. My first sonogram showed no masses and it was completely normal. I saw a breast surgeon who said he is not concerned at all after looking at my mammo and initial sonogram. He told me to come back in 6 months for another mammo and sonogram. So who should I believe the radiologist or surgeon.? I am anxious and worried. Any advice as to who I should believe more the radiologist or breast surgeon? Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
