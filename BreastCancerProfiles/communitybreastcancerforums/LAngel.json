I am post menopausal, 61 years old, and all my life have had very dense fibrous breast tissue and still do after menopause. I know a regular mammogram doesn't pick up everything with this condition called \"fibrocystic breast condition\". My sister died at age 61 from breast cancer with this condition and it was never recommended she get a breast ultrasound until it was to late. Does anyone else want to talk about this?

They have to find something first on a regular mammogram, then they will pay for an ultrasound if you ask for one. This has been my experience for years. Seems like it should be the other way around. Prevention should come first. It would be less expensive for the insurance companies if cancer is found earlier. Thank You",

A lot of women have very dense breasts and it should be a no brainer for them to see that we need both mammogram and ultrasound. I just think it's a way to make more money for them. If a women has advanced breast cancer it's more money for the medical industry, so why should they try and prevent us from finding it earlier. They don't care about us, just about making more money. That's what it's all about in America, people don't matter, just money.",

And I guess we have to educate doctors about this issue as well, so they start to tell us what condition our breasts are and not keep it a secret any longer.",
