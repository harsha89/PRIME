I am sooooo sorry you were in the hospital for so long. I didn't have that ...thank God. Eileen, everyone is different. I had my bi-mast on 3/21 first thing in the morning. I was home by 11:00 am the next morning. Everything was numb. I was very stiff and uncomfortable but really no pain. I can't really answer the question about work because....I closed my business after my diagnosis. I think the stress I was under helped my cancer rear it's ugly head. But, I was up walking around the next day. I did sleep alot for the first few days though. Getting up out of bed was bad. Hope you have strong stomach muscles!! So emg is right about propping yourself up. To this day, I sleep on my back because of my expanders. Can't wait to sleep on my stomach. Wait....can you do that with implants??????? Anyway, my best advise is to go and buy the softest.........button up jammie or other tops you can find. My sister bought me a pair and I swear...I laid in bed while she washed it for me. It was the only thing I felt comfortable in. I drove myself to church after a week and a half. Don't forget to stretch. Stretch and hold. That really, really helps. Good luck girl. Traci oh yea....your question about washing your hair. Hopefully, you'll be like me and be able to lean over the kitchen sink while someone washes your hair in no time.",

I have an idea though.....ok...you said you don't have \"much\" help...but, I'm sure you can find a neighbor or one of your kids friends to get the boys out of the house for few hours. Right? Plan a early dinner to be delivered at a specific time, doesn't have to be anything fancy.....(even places that don't deliver will, if you ask them at a non-peak time). And before that, have two massage therapists come over and give you guys duo massages!! You can do this for as little as $100 (each of course...) here. They will come to your house  with bed and all.....but...before that, bath maybe......candles and soft music! So you have a nice bath, massage and then a relaxing dinner that cleans up in as much time as it takes you to throw it in the garbage! I've heard you talk about him.....I feel in my heart, you guys will be o.k. girl. Just another bump in the road. In my humble, opinion. Hugs, Traci",

So Sorry. I'm right with you....I never.................want to do chemo again. Fact is, there are women on this site that have done practically non-stop chemo for YEARS.....trying to find one that works. I mean....literally...a break of several weeks here and there but other than that....chemo...every week, two weeks, three weeks, whatever. Again, I don't mean to sound negative. My point is.....they are still living (and, having fun) and fighting......if you have to do chemo again...yes, your body can handle it and, it will hopefully kick some cancer butt...just like your last one did. NED (No Evidence of Disease) for six years!!! You can do that again! You might want to check out the recurrance thread. Almost everybody there has had a recurrance of cancer and subsequently, chemo....again. And, you'll find that everybody....who isn't having a bad day.....(which we all have) has a super positive attitude! That thread has comforted me in more ways than words can describe. Good luck girl. Know we are here for you and know that you can....do it again. As some say on here...I am sending you great, big, giant, gentle cyber hugs. Traci",

I literally slept with a scarf on my head just in case somebody came into my bedroom univited to see if I was puking from chemo. My mom didn't see me bald, my siblings didn't, my best friend in the whole wide world didn't, my roommate didn't. NOBODY besides that wig lady did. When I had my implant surgery, I told the nurse and doctor, \"this bandana better still be on my head when I wake up\". I meant it and, it was. It was as far from a laughing matter as anything I have ever experienced in my life. Call it vanity, call it lack of self esteem, call it what ever the hell you want, I don't care. I HATED IT. I still hate my hair although, I am thankful beyond belief to have at least some back even if I do look like the guy in Knocked Up. Every single day, I wake up and look in the mirror and get pissed. I don't want to go anywhere and I REALLY didn't want to go anywhere when I was bald. I tried the wigs, they didn't work for me. I spent my 10 months of baldness with bandana's on my head. 24/7. Short story, then I'll stop. We had sort of a family reunion/party at my house. Most people there, had not seen me since I lost my hair. Now, I never shaved my head. I refused. At this point, I had maybe 50 hairs sticking out from my bandana. EVERYFREAKINGBODY at that party was saying things that you all have mentioned; \"It'll grow back\" blah, blah, blah. I was so tired. And, sick. I was sick and tired of people trying to make me feel better about being bald!!! So, I decided to \"hide\" for a minute. I had a little sitting area outside. I was sitting there when my bro's girlfriend (who I love) came up and sat down. She said \"Is that all that's left of your hair?\" I said \"Yes.\" She said \"That sucks.\" and she cried with me. I love that girl. Kudos to you Hasling. For me, what I hated most about being bald was EVERYTHING. Hugs everybody, Traci",

I hope and pray the your DIL changes her tune sooner, rather than later, and lets you embrace those grand-babies again real soon. Vent all you want LuAnn. That's what we are here for!! As far as your scans, I'm reminded of a scene in Steel Magnolia's where Truvey says to Malinda \"I wish I had some words of wisdom, but I don't so, why don't we focus on the joy of the situation!\" They can't see the cancer progressing!!!!

I would call the Oncologist's office and ask to speak to the head chemo nurse. She'll know. My sister was sick with a cold - not the same kind of infection, of course - but they gave her chemo anyway, and it knocked her on her *ss. She had a terrible time with it, so much so, that she quit chemo. I know it's not the same situation, I'm just saying that I think you should be totally okay (cancer aside...lol...not) before you do chemo. On the other hand, maybe the chemo will kick the infections butt too!  Wish I had a better answer, and I'm sure somebody will come along soon that knows, but just wanted to give my two cents, and wish you the best of luck.

He said that she's not able to get online to chat with us however, he does read our posts to her and she is able to enjoy cards and such that come in the mail. Having said that; the address that I gave so many of you that wanted to participate in a card shower was a physical address that John gave me when I sent our beautiful Deb some flowers when her eye probs first started. They do not deliver mail to that address. I am so sorry for that. I didn't realize. He gave me a PO Box # for card delivery and said it was o.k. to post it. Please, re-send those cards to our Dear Deb. I still have mine that came back and will send it tomorrow. The address is: PO Box 1151, Soldotna, AK 99669. If you need a last name, just PM me.

You are entitled to a copy of every single piece of paper all of your doctors create about you. Every scan, every mammo, every everything, and I encourage you to get those copies so you can do your own research and get a second opinion if you want.  That is YOUR file, not theirs. Second, yes....some doctors absolutely leave out details. Recently I was with my Mom at her Ocologist office and he said something along the lines of: \"some of the tumors are smaller, and some are larger....\" when we got home and I finally had a chance to read the most recent path report, which I simply had to wait for a copy to be made after the Onc was finished, I discovered that she had two NEW tumors! He didn't bother telling us that. (Perhaps because he new she was near the end of her life and thought that telling her that would benefit no one, but whatever.) I hope that what you felt is nothing, but you have to be your own advocate. Get copies of everything so you can read all the results, comments, etc., with your own two eyes.

I am brca+. My little sis who had bc 9 yrs ago got tested after my bc dx and she too is +. My older sister who had uterine and cervical cancer 2 yrs ago is negative. My other sister has yet to be tested. We all have the same mom and dad. I have 9 neices 18 or younger. So far, 3 have been tested. 2 positive, one negative. The negative one, 16 yrs old, has already had a scare with something on her ovaries. Thank God, it was not cancer. Honestly, I don't think any of this matters really. I believe cancer is a part of our make up as a human being. (A doctor (onc) told me that when I was on a plane going to see my little sis after her dx.)  Whether or not it rears it's ugly head is a crap shoot. I wish you the best of luck. Sincerely, Traci",

We'll be thinking about you on the 15th. As far as the anti-depressents....I take xanax. When I first felt my lump I shook on the inside. I couldn't shake on the outside...work...family...friends...you gotta be strong..but, on the inside, I was losing it. The xanax really, really helped me. But, like badboob says, they do not work for everybody. I hope you find what works for you to keep your stress in check. Geeta, Good thing your not near her old onc!! After the shaking I can see a kick in the jaw! Diane, I love your post about shoes you have to tie. Really. I swear, I am going to try that. Some mornings it is so hard to keep going after that initial awakening. That is an awesome idea. And btw, I cringe everytime I see your posts about your lost films.....gawd...are they still looking for them? I mean, in my business there are tons of files too and yes, files do get lost. However, we always find them! One time, (true story) after a girl was let go, there were numerous files missing. We looked in every inch of the office. Including......are you ready......the ceiling tiles. This girl was hiding files in the ceiling tiles!!!!! Someone had seen or heard of it and sure enough.....there they were. Funny but....not funny. Good luck Oz. Please keep us posted. Night everybody. Hugs, Traci",

How do I tell a man I just met that I have concrete, flat hamburger buns for boobs from a botched reconstruction job, a massive 'muffin top' that I blame from being thrown prematurally into menopause, (well that and laziness developed from fear, chemo and depression) and zero if any desire for sex because of both?  My Sister, also a BC survivor, says she's looking for an impotent, international pilot for her next husband. LOL I love Kim's idea of taking a class. That's what I did and man, oh man, has having a new hobby filled some lonely nights.

My older sister who had uterine and cervical cancer 2 yrs ago is negative. My other sister has yet to be tested. We all have the same mom and dad. I have 9 neices 18 or younger. So far, 3 have been tested. 2 positive, one negative. The negative one, 16 yrs old, has already had a scare with something on her ovaries. Thank God, it was not cancer. Honestly, I don't think any of this matters really. I believe cancer is a part of our make up as a human being. (A doctor (onc) told me that when I was on a plane going to see my little sis after her dx.)  Whether or not it rears it's ugly head is a crap shoot. I wish you the best of luck and, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. Sincerely, Traci",

I forgot to tell you guys that he mentioned they had received \"so many cards from all over the world\"...so thanks to everybody that was able to participate in her card shower. Lisa, it's brief now but, John mentioned they would probably be writing more about her. It's not a huge town and I'm sure Deb was loved even more by people there that saw her every day. I found another story about her: http://www.peninsulaclarion.com/stories/093007/people_4048.shtml Be forewarned....the title to the story threw me back a little but reading Deb's quotes in the story was great.

Some days after my bi-mast, I went out to my front porch to take in some outdoor air. Two teenage boys (16ish?) were riding by on their bicycles. I waved, smiled and said hello and they turned around as if to \"check me out\" and when the one kid got a better look he said \"Man, you are flat chested!\" I was shocked. I yelled back \"That's because I just had my breasts cut off thanks to cancer!!!!\" You should have seen the look on that kids face. I know he was mortified. I doubt he ever makes another comment like that again in his life. I also doubt that your neighbor let that go. I'm sure she gave that young man a lecture about what he did, impulsive reaction or not, and I'm sure he feels very badly about what happened. Or, maybe he doesn't....if he doesn't, then God help him. Like you, I was crushed to tears. I cried for a long time. I'm so sorry you had to have that happen after all you have been through.

I'm so happy to meet you although, I'm sorry it's under such shitty circumstances. I'm not having a good day either but mine is nothing compared to yours. I read your post three times, and just cried a really needed cry. It hurts my heart that you are going through this at such a young age. I mean, it sucks for all of us but...you are so young. I'm so sorry. You make me think of this girl I sat across from in that cold chemo room. She was so young. She was thin and pretty with long blonde hair. She was so scared. She didn't belong in there. She looked really out of place. She looked like she belonged in college, surrounding by boys. They couldn't find a vein in her tiny arms. She started to cry. Finally, the awesome nurse (they were all great weren't they...but isn't there always one that is awesome?) came over to her chair to try. I don't know what she said to the girl but, she made her smile through her tears and she rubbed her arm gently for a few minutes to warm her up, and her blood. She found a vein with only one stick. I'll never forget that girls face. Never. When I got my last blood work done, I asked about that girl and was told that she was finished with treatment and doing o.k. I forget what the point to that story was......I guess I was just....I don't know. I'm sorry your having such a terrible time. It breaks my heart today. I wish there was something I could do. Please know that you could never write a post that was too long. I loved hearing your love story. We are here for you; to listen, to lean on, to love. Love, Traci",

I've got three words for you girl: keep a list! I write everything down. If it's something I need to do, I put it on my to do list. It REALLY helps. Last night I was talking to a friend just before going to sleep, I was in bed. She asked me to email her something the next morning  and so I got up, went to my home office and put it on my list. Regarding your second post....sorry but, that one made me laugh too especially the part about not knowing whether you were going out of a room or just came in!! That happens to me all the time. I'm walking and all of the sudden I stop and have no idea what I was doing. Your right though, it is really not funny. (Though if we can't laugh at it sometimes.....) I forget entire phone conversations. It's like I've started to precede every thing I'm about to say with \"Did I already tell you......?\" It does get very frustrating at times. Lori, you getting the fact that you're not alone!!?? My little sister had chemo 9 years ago and I'm sorry to tell you guys that although her memory has gotten better, it is not what it use to be. She still writes stuff down. She's o.k. though!! Hugs, Traci",

I don't think it's God's fault that I have cancer. Or his fault everybody on this board does or two of my three sisters or my dad who just died at the young age of 65 of cancer.... But yes, I have all but lost my faith. In fact, my boyfriend and I recently split in no small part because of our arguements on faith. I still pray I'll get it back though. Hugs, Traci",

The only problem is, the search results start from oldest to newest so, be sure to hit the \"last\" on the # of pages unless your looking for something really old. Also, it posts every comment. So if you look for a poster, it will show every post where anyone mentioned there name. Not like the old search engine but also not enough to gripe about in my humble opinion. This site doesn't cost of anything and is priceless. Hugs, Traci",

It helped me immediately. Honestly, I don't know how I would have coped without it. She warned me of the addictiveness of the drug, and I headed that warning. I only took it when I could feel the anxiety coming on. And in spite of the fact that kids today are paying $20 for one pill, it didn't do anything to me except calm me down. I can't remember the dose, but I'm sure it was the smallest available. I never felt loopey or high or anything like that. It's hard to describe...it just worked. My Sister Debbi takes Zoloft. When our big brother got married recently, everybody was shedding tears of happiness for him during the ceremony. Debbi was sitting next to me and I said: \"I can't believe your not crying.\" She said: \"I want to cry, but I took my Zoloft.\" Our big Sister Denise is a major stressoholic. She takes everything too seriously, and is just so melodramatic. It was starting to weigh on her life/marriage. Debbi convinced her to try Zoloft, and now she's a happy camper. Really. Find one that works for you my friend, because they do work. Traci PS: I haven't taken Xanax regularly, or even often, for a couple of years now. I just needed something to get over those massives freaking hurdles, treaments, etc. Now I just pop one if I get stressed, like during football season when the Cowboys play the Eagles or Giants.",

I can imagine it though.....I'm sure it pulled at your heart strings like nothing else ever could. I hope that the joy you must feel of those kids being yours, overcomes your feelings of sadness for having to talk to them about this awful cancer, as soon as possible. You will live on forever, through them and their kids, and their kids, etc. I hope this note doesn't upset you in any way. I only mean to say something to make you feel just a little bit better.

They've got the super soft ones now in the jammy section that I highly recommend, and if you get the ones with pockets, you can wear it inside out and put the drains in the pockets. That's a tip I got on this board that worked wonders for me. It beat the heck out of safety pinning the drains to whatever I was wearing. Another girl got button up 'moo moo's' with pockets and wore them inside out. I never got one of those, but that too is an awesome idea for the drains and all the stores like Penny's etc., have those. Like Barb, I didn't experience any real 'pain', just very stiff and tight torso. Another tip I got on here was for exercise. Stand next to a walll and crawl your hands up the wall like a spider to slowly stretch your muscles. That helped a lot too. Good luck, Ladies!!! Like Barb said, it's not near as bad as your brain would think. I was actually shocked at how little it 'hurt'. :) Traci",

I wanted to address one of your original questions though. My 'lil fellow bc sis...had a bone biopsy of her t-7 and another vertabrae (sp?) and unlike LuAnne (God love you girl) it was horrible for her. If...you have to have this procedure, make them put you under. They may tell you they \"need you awake\" but you tell them, you do not want to feel any pain. My sister came out of there broken up and she is a strong girl. She was really crying hard about the pain she endured. She battled chemo 9 years ago when they didn't have the meds to make you not throw up. Thank God, they said it wasn't cancer in her spine. Only degeneretive (sp?) stuff. Anyway, I'm happy for your good news!!!! Hugs, Traci",

Daily, I wish I had a child to write one for and daily, I wish my father would have left one for me when he passed. Don't know if you remember or not but, when 'ForTheMoment' aka Erin died, I went to her service and they had a letter from her to her 2 yr old daughter up on the huge screen for everyone to read. It was the most beautiful letter I had ever read. It brought me to uncontrollable tears. I just know that when her baby is old enough to read and appreciate that letter, it will always mean more to her than anything else she will ever encounter in life. It was breathtakingly heartfelt.  Having said all of that...remember what Lisa40 used to say: fists up!! Love, Traci",

Some people are just busy bodies. My brother has two bad knees. He has a handicap permit as well. I went with him to the grocery store one day. We had been at his house, sitting, watching football. When we got to the store, he was able to walk in with no problem. Someone also approached us. It was a much older man and boy, was he is lecture mode. My brother who is hysterical (like Geeta) started saying stuff to him in a foreign lauguage that he made up. It was so funny. Thanks for bringing back that memory and making me laugh. Anyway, the old man ended up walking away scared. lol.... And, the end to the story is...by the time we were done with the shopping, my brother practically needed a wheelchair to get to the car.
