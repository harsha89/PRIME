I didnt have to have chemo so i feel like everyone thinks i shouldnt be tired. even though it affects everyone differently, dr told me some people that didnt have chemo have a harder time with fatigue during radiation because your body isnt used to changes in cells and stuff. who knows. Either way it goes by fast so I hope to get back into the swing of things soon. sore throat too. rad onc said it could not be from the radiation because of the angle but i truely believe it is. Marcia1111 good luck",

How weird is that! i should say see yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa lol. I forgot about labor day as well so i thought i would finish wednesday, the day before my kids start school. Now i have to go on there first day of school. Bummer. As for me no redness at all and havent used a drop of lotion. I have sensitive skin even with plain lotions i break out so iÂ was told not to put anything on until i felt the need. I cant believe i havent needed it because i have fair skin. Well i guess 1 thing can go my way. Hope everyone is doing well. Karen that is wonderful you were able to get done in time for the wedding :) ((((((((((((((hugs)))))))))))))))) to all Theresa",

I didnt even get pink until the last 3 rads and i feel worse after its over. Weird? i am thinking that my expander was so stretched after my fills that when they took out half of the saline for rads that i need more cushion? or maybe my skin just tightened up so now its rubbing on it? i dont know but i wish i could just take them out at this point. Congratulations to all who have finished, stay strong to those still going at it, and good luck to those starting.",
