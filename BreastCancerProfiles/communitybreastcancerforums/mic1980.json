      "Content": "mic1980 wrote: Hi everyone, I posted here a few years ago about what turned out to be a fibroadenoma in my left breast. I am 34 and this is my 2nd benign lump (other was on the right). This one was benign on a core biopsy and so I had ultrasounds multiple times over the past few years at a breast center in NYC, no changes. Last time I went it had been 3 years and the surgeon told me that he didn't think I needed to come back for that lump until it was time to start my regular mammos at 40. At that same last appointment I pointed out to the imaging tech that I also felt a thicker area in the left upper outer quadrant. She went over the area pretty thoroughly in the US and said she didn't see anything. When I went to speak to the surgeon I mentioned the thicker area to him as well, he felt the area and said it didn't concern him and that it's probably just asymmetric breast tissue. Fast forward 8 months, that area is still there, and when I went to my gyno today she noticed the thicker area (without me pointing it out). I told her the backstory and she said something along the lines of, that surgeon is one of the best and if he wasn't worried than she wouldn't be either. Here's the thing, no doctor has ever mentioned this area to me on their own before, which makes me think it's become more prominent. Whether it's gotten bigger since I saw the surgeon 8 months ago, I couldn't be sure. Sometimes I think I've just become so paranoid about this breast due to the fibroadenoma that I'm making myself notice things that may have always been there. Should I go back to the surgeon again, or just try to stop worrying about it? Thanks for reading all, sorry for the long post! Log in to post a reply",

They looked closely at the thicker area and showed it to me on the ultrasound screen. There is nothing abnormal. The way the radiologist described it is that the tissue in the upper outer quadrant of this breast is \"more organized.\" He pointed out how when he moved over it with the wand, this section of tissue moved under the pressure of the wand more quickly, sort of as a unit. I hope I'm describing that in a way that makes sense :) But yeah he and I could see that it was just normal tissue. They said to make sure I check it regularly in BSE but right now it's nothing to worry about. I had a cyst in that area too so it may just be fibrocystic tissue, though it doesn't change with my cycle that I can notice.",

I decided to go back to the surgeon again since I already had an appointment to do so...I bumped it up, so it's a week from today. Lately I've been having occasional pain in the armpit on that side as well, which is disconcerting, though it may be due to my repeated obsessive BSEs. I will post again after my appointment.",
