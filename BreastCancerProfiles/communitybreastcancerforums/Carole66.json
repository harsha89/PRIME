I did 4 rounds of AC and 4 rounds of Taxol fininshing on July 8th.  Withing 2 weeks of finishing the Taxol I starting notcing my hair filing in as I shaved my head when it got really thin and what was leftover never fell out. It's mostly growing on top and the back right now. I had frizzy curly hair before so I guess it looks like it might be the same growing back by everyone responses. the eyelashes and eyebrows I noticed thinning out but around my 6th round of chemo. I have maybe one or 2 eyelashes left and about half my eyebrows which I fill out with pencil. I started wearing fake eyelashes. It took a while to get used to putting them on correctly but getting the hang of it. I can't wait for the hair to grow back. we have had such a hot summer here so far, wearing the wig has been really hot.",

After 2 weeks I was still putting out 50CC in my left drain but my PS said he couldn't leave it any longer because of risk of infection. I went in Sept 8 for what was supposed to be my first fill and instead ended up having a ultrasound guided aspiration to remove the fluid build up in my left breast. It took away the pain but my left breast is still getting bigger. So I went back yesterday and I am being scheduled today to have fluid removed again but if this time it doesn't work. My PS said he will need to remove the TE and replace it but if during surgery it doesn't look good he may opt to leave it out completely for a few months. I hate not knowing what I will wake up to if I need the surgery. Has anyone had something similar happen to them? Dx 3/5/2010, 4cm, Stage IIA, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

I had a BMX on Aug 12 and shortly after my eyelashes started growing now both are fully grown back. I did use the Loreal lash booster and they are now longer than they were before chemo. Now if only my hair would grow back that quick. Its still short and I gel it and it is growing back kinky and curly of course. I colored it my natural dark brown about 3 weeks ago and it looks much better.",
