Perhaps you could do the leg work for her and contact the breast treatment centers in her town and see if they have a similar program that she could utilitze. If they do and she qualifies then she wouldn't have to have the financial worries.  Just a thought.  :) And I'm really sorry about your friend. I lost my Mom to breast cancer a little over a year ago. It really is diffiuclt and I wish you didn't have the pain of losing your friend. I'm sending warm thoughts and hugs your way Lynn! I wish there was more I could do.  *hugs*",
