I know that when you get that far out you believe that you have beat the breast.  In reality, those of us that are hormone positive can tend to relaspe 8 to even 20 years out.  The pills we take work at first but then the cancer sometimes seems to figure it out.  The fact that she has had eight years generally means that she will respond to the new treatment..slow growing cancer helps......sounds like she is getting Faslodex which is a good drug as well as Zometa.  Let's hope this kicks the cancer's butt back to remission. It is possible and she should have hope.  Bones is the best place (not that we want it)  for cancer to come back....it is usually quite treatable.  She is blessed to have you.  Jacqueline",

I too don't want to be the cancer girl.... I never wore the pink ribbon pins or bracelets people gave me. If I could keep it all a secret I would. On the other hand, I know how much speaking to several people that had a big tumor and multiple nodes \"saved\" my sanity in the beginning of my diagnosis.....those two women helped me more than they can ever know. They gave me the hope I needed so much the first couple of years. So in my case, I do take the calls & offer to help those that need a positive voice in the wake of cancer darkness. It's one of the many reasons I come back here 13 years later. My cancer was so bad.......honestly everyone can be hopeful:) But this is a personal decision I chose and it should be up to the individual and not be forced on.... for sure. Jacqueline",

My funny wig story is that I bought a beautiful long hair wig.....I was walking down the street downtown outside of my office and a good looking guy came up to me and told me just how beautiful my hair was and how I should never cut it.... I just smiled & said thank you..... so tempted to just pull the wig off!!!  LOL. Keep the faith and fists up! Jacqueline",

My cancer was huge...ILC mixed with IDC over 8cm.....I had at least 17 nodes positive with two with cancer bursting out of it... I had it in my skin.... I had LVI..... I had COX 3+++....didn't have clean margins.... I actually had a doctor cry in front of me knowing that my youngest was in first grade. Flash forward: I have seen two of my children graduate high school and one from college.  I have one more (my first grader) that will be a senior in high school. In the beginning I was sure this day would not happen.....but hope is a beautiful thing....and with hope all things are possible. My children gave me a bouquet of ten roses.....each with a memory I was here for these past ten years.  I can't describe how great that felt to read each one. And to my husband I told him that he was my rock.....the one that pulled me up when I went to a dark place.....who went and still does go to every doctor appt. Who helped me build memories with my children.....just in case. We have something called YATCOMW.....stands for \"You are the center of my world\"....and he is. For those just starting out.....find hope in this long list of people doing well.  We clung to those that were in front of us.  Life does pick up and move forward albeit slowly. Soon you will be adding your name to this long list of those before you! God bless, Jacqueline",

Risk of recurrence persisted from the first treatment to at least 20 years after treatment, and the risk is significantly increased even in patients with lymph node metastasis occurring >10 years. Regarding the biology, a reverse phenomenon was seen compared to early recurrence. The recurrence risk ≥10 years was high for the patients positive for ER and PgR, with low Ki-67 index and luminal/HER2- subtype, and negative for HER2 and p53. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis and PgR positivity are significant factors for late recurrence in all the tumors as well as ER-positive tumors. The recurrence rate beyond 10 years was low, and as a result the power of statistical analysis may be limited. However, the results indicated that late recurrence would occur in the PgR-positive patients with lymph node metastasis. The full article at https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/353099",

Men like to be \"the\" one...it is in their DNA......they really want all of our attention.....When you marry it is all about them.  But as the years go on our careers take hold of our time.....then add the kids.....then add the soccer mom and football mom.......we're about 40 at this point......and so what happens to that guy who wants all the attention?  He is in many ways not getting it anymore.  So he looks for someone that doesn't have all those other committments and where he can be \"the one\" again... I think for a marriage to work the test of time it takes a concerted effort to make sure that you find \"him\" time---whether it be taking him away for a weekend....going to a football game with him....whatever that will make him special. There are statistics out there that say that 70% of all men cheat at some point.  My sister says the other 30% would but they aren't good looking enough (smile).  We can hope that these statistics are wrong......I'm fortunate to be married to a great guy that I met in college....we have been together for over 30 years.  I can assure you I could have not gone through this journey without him!  I do try to make sure that cancer doesn't make this all about me and work hard at making sure he gets his time...

I don't know if the aggressive chemo worked on my cancer or not since I had surgery first......but I have always believed that Femara has been my wonder drug. I would get a second opinion on whether you can't have children now. I know plenty of women that have gone on with having children with your stats. I saw no less than 6 opinions with my cancer....there is nothing wrong with speaking with someone else particularly at a good cancer center. Hang in there.....it does get better.

Honestly I think it is great that she got ten years and then almost another ten.......should mean we should get 30 and 30 and die of something else like old age!!! Jacqueline ",

The list goes on.......you immediately think cancer......and although I hated to get scanned as I like living in denial......once I finally do get it done...it does provide peace again.........until the next strange pain. We have all been through hell and back and our body continues to remind us of that.  I am sure you are fine.....but maybe the scan will give you back the peace. Fists Up! Jacqueline",

But I wanted to jump in and tell you I had tons of nodes positive too.....at least 17....and my tumor was 8 cm X 6 cm....so all pretty close to what you got.....in fact I had some other not so postive characteristics on my path report that you don't have. I will also tell you that I am over 5 years out.....there are a few ladies here ahead of me....and we've got Sherri G and others coming up on their 5 years in a few months....so hang onto that... I know I did when I was first diagnosed.  It looks daunting at first but you will find a lot of us are moving on and getting our life back after a very scary path report! Hang in there!!!  We are all here to help. Jacqueline",

I also don't get scans unless I have had a pain that doesn't go away within a couple of weeks.......it really isn't good to get all of these scans so I would save mine for when I have a concern.  Just my two cents.  Hope this helps.  Jacqueline",
