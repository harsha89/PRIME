Could only see 1.1 cm tumor on 3D tomo, so stereotactic needle biopsy failed, US biopsy didn't work. In the end, it was better as I know. I will have a lumpectomy, lift, reduction, node biopsy on 3/22 then bilateral MX in June with implants. So far stage 1 grade 1, but this was in my left breast. For 13 years, all the issues were in my right. Right: fibroadenoma, atypical lobular hyperplasia, calcs, 4 core needles, 1 fine needle, and 1 excisional over the course of 13 years. And.....cancer was diagnosed in left. Terrified of MRI. :( ....before surgery. One day at a time...one foot in front of the other.",
