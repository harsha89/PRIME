I have posted on this site about how lonely ovarian cancer can be.  You don't have the support or the attention.  There are few women to support you because so few make it.  A Toronto television show a few years back had their entire audience made up of women who were going to walk in the annual \"Weekend To End Breast Cancer\" in support of the Princcess Margaret Hospital.  I politely emailed them asking if they could include other women's cancers in future especially as September is Ovarian Cancer Awareness month and this show aired in September. I received a polite response saying they would consider it and, of course, nothing happened.  I am pleased to report however that the walk has this year changed to the \"Weekend to End Women's Cancers\".  Now that's progress. As annoying as Pinktober is, it's better than being ignored.  I remember walking in Costco a few years ago and stopping dead in my tracks.  An ovarian cancer PSA was running on a TV and I had to stop in shock to actually hear anything about ovarian cancer. So thank you again for sharing.",

My mother died in 2001 after several recurrencies and a year later I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  My sisters and I had the genetic testing at that time and I was referred to a high risk breast cancer clinic.  At that time the doctor mentioned the possibility of prophylactic mastectomy but said I should find out my prognosis first; in other words, why put yourself through all that if you aren't gong to be around much longer. He left and I was referred to another doctor and, when I asked her about it, she didn't recommend it.  Fast forward to October 2007 and I was diagnosed with breast cancer, late stage three, lymph nodes involved and because the lymph nodes behind the breastbone were involved and couldn't be operated on I started with chemo, followed by surgery, soon to be followed by radiation and Herceptin is also ongoing.  I can't have reconstruction until after the radiation and have to wait to make sure it doesn't come back. So the right mast was prophylactic.  I wish someone had hit me over the head  and told me to have the double mastectomy several years ago.  I could have avoided all of this.  I think my doctor should have told me to have it.  Obviously hindsight is 20/20 but I was at HIGH risk so why didn't anyone lay it on the line? My advice would be to have it done if you feel you are high risk.  I thought I would be devastated losing my breasts but, surprisingly, I'm not that bothered (I'm 55; maybe that helps, but still was very happy with my breasts!).  I'm glad I had both off.  I think just having one breast would be more difficult to deal with.  This way I have a matching pair. Best of luck with your decision.",

The whole Oprah thing makes me seethe.  She likes happy endings and positivity.  It's not always possible to be positive no matter what stage you are but no one wants to hear about that.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if Ellen stepped up to the plate.  A few years ago Oprah had a breast cancer special and the Komen sister was on and it was very moving.  Then Christina Applegate came on with her new breasts touting that she was cured!  Wow, it was hard to swallow. People want to sweep Stage IV under the carpet.  No one wants to think it can happen to them.  What's awareness if we ignore those people who need us the most?",

I knew in that moment that I had cancer.  When I arrived the next day I was given a form re Care After Biopsy.  I said \"I'm getting a biopsy?\".  The receptionist said \"That's just in case they decide to do one.\"  Nice recovery.  Then when I was in the waiting room waiting to be called two ladies came to talk to me about being in a clinical trial!  It seemed like everyone else knew what was going on before I did.  Anyway, I didn't qualify for the trial as I'd had chemo before (for ovarian cancer). So I had a mammo, ultrasound and biopsy of the breast and node.  I asked the doctor if she thought it was cancer and she said \"Yes\".  It just confirmed what my gut was already telling me.  So like most people in my position I was hoping for Stage I.  That was dashed when I found out I had at least one node involved.  Okay, I thought, so Stage II.  That was crushed when a cat scan revealed that the lymph nodes behind the breastbone were involved and they can't be operated on.  The surgeon, when pressed, hesitated and said a late stage III but I felt like he was hesitating because he thought maybe even Stage IV.  I thought at that moment that it was the end of the road for me.  Luckily for me the chemo shrunk the tumour as well as the lymphs and the surgeon was thrilled with the results. So here I am one year later with more of my innocence dashed and having had to face my own mortatlity yet again.  You see, I had Stage III ovarian cancer six years ago.  What is it with the number III.  I still feel like I'm in a bad dream and can't believe that I had to go through all of this again.  Will I ever feel normal again?

My nurse recommended that I take the nausea meds before I felt nauseated, so preventatively rather than after the fact.  It seemed to work better.  Water is the best thing to drink to flush your system.",

I won't lie to you.  I found Taxotere to be brutal.  I also took steroids with it:  the day before, day of and the day after.  What I found was that I had lots of energy due to the steroids for several days after chemo.  By about four days after I crashed.  The nurse said it was due to coming off the steroids so the second time they weaned me off the steroids by reducing the dosage for several more days.  What this did was just delay the crash so I think the Taxotere had a lot to do with how I felt. For about four days (give or take a day) I would by almost comatosed in that all I could do was lay on the couch.  Some days I was lucky to have the energy for a shower.  One time I almost passed out.  By about one and a half weeks after the chemo I would feel better again. I also got bad mouth sores.  Each time they got worse and lasted longer.  The doctor prescribed a mouth wash which you swish around and then swallow (to get the sores in the very back of the mouth).  By the third treatment I was drinking the mouthwash many times a day! Taxotere also weakens your nails.  I had several fall off.  This isn't as bad as it sounds.  By the time the nail falls off you have a new \"baby\" nail underneath.  Several ladies I see when I go for Herceptin were just recently on Taxotere and two of them ended up in the hospital.  This was due to getting a fever so just watch her temp and go to the emergency if she gets a fever. I don't want to scare you but just make you aware so that you know what to expect and know that she will get through it.  After all, I did. Best of luck to you and your Mom.",
