I had a pretty fast and semi easy surgery and recovery. I went back to work full time 3 weeks after BMX and TE placement. My PS did slow fills 60cc every 2-3 weeks. It took 6 months until exchange, which was on June 13. I feel good and went back to work after a week off. No drains with exchange and the 45- 700cc look good. I have to say that over the last 8 months emotions have run high and low. Friends interact to the level they feel is fine- we cant control what others feel and do. My work support has been great. I don't know if I needed to know anything different. I take one day at a time. Try to stay positive and self motivate. Reading these boards helps the emotional side. No one knows what we go through, only if you've gone through it yourself. Keep your heads up. Stay positive. Love yourself. Love others.",

Somewhat the same but different. Your mom is a gem, what good advice. You've been married a good long time. As a military spouse you just suck it up and deal with any situation. Giving him clear expectations and realistic duties may help. He's use to that. Glad you found this board to vent and get some others perspective and listening skills. I will be thinking positive thoughts and prayers for you and your family!",
