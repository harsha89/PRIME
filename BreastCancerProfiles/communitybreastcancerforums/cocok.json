I was in so much pain. I was only taking one dilaudid every 3 hours-I should have been taking 2 or 3 every 3-4 hours. Don't make that mistake. It took me about 18 hours to catch up and get the pain under control (i.e. a 4 on a scale of 1-10). Since Thursday, I am only taking tylenol, advil during the day and one norco at night. The narcotics made me too constipated in spite of the arsenal of drugs/herbs/food I took to counter-act that. The TE feels a bit like a vice, but I am out walking a bit and doing light chores. The foob doesn't look as bad as I thought it would.  Prayers to all of you who are dealing with worse scenarios.",
