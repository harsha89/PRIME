Ultimate results post-surgery were left side .6cm, grade 1 tumor, no nodes. Right side, 1.1 and 1.4 cm IDC, both grade 3, DCIS 1.0cm, grade 3, and 1.6mm in right sentinel node. No other nodes removed bc biopsy during surgery was negative. All ER+, PR+ and HER2-. Oncologist has recommended AC+T, but standard schedule over 24 weeks (ACx4/3weeks and Tx12 weekly). He said that he wasn't convinced about the dose dense studies because they used multiple variables and he felt the harshness of the treatment was not justified. I have a friend about 3ish years older than me who had very similar tumors and received AC in the dose dense (every other week) with a different doctor, same hospital, just last year. So...who knows. I start in May.",

My HCPs have seemed surprised by how quickly I am recovering, but I got my drains out one week post surgery and have been doing very well. I do tire easily but my range of motion has been very good. I can raise my hands above my head pretty easily and have been able to do so for most of my recovery. I had sentinel node biopsies on both sides but no other nodes removed. I also had the tissue expanders placed over the muscle rather than under (because my repair later will be flap surgery, sub-muscle was not necessary.) I think both of those things have helped my recovery. Anyway, I don't know what you do, but I could go back to work at least part of the day at this point. I am an attorney so I mostly sit at a desk all day. And I can shut my door and be \"off\" for a little while if necessary. I wouldn't count on being able to return and would make other plans, but it could happen.",
