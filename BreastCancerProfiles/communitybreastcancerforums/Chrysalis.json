He also started on Lexipro, which has been a godsend.  I can't speak to the Zoloft withdrawal (although my daughter was on it and when she was titrating down to go on a different SSRI, she didn't really have a problem), but maybe it's worth another try if a good alternative is determined. I think it's great that your husband reached out to you to confide his difficulties.  That's a huge first step.  I don't know if he'd consider any counseling - does your treatment center have a social worker or someone who is accustomed to dealing with cancer issues?  I know ours treats patients and their families for free.  Maybe that's an option. Just when things started getting better for us, I was hit with bone mets.  It's been a year and a half, and I was mostly worried that my husband would come unwound again.  But now we know what the signs are, and we just keep talking.  When he's down, it kind of gives me strength to be there for him, and vice versa. I wish I could give you the magic solution.  It sounds like the two of your have an awesome commitment, and if you have that, you can weather this together.  I'll be praying for both of you and sending positive energy your way. Renee",

Please know that there are so many options available for bone mets (I've had bone mets for about 1.5 years and just found out I have some progession).  You have definitely come \"home\" to the right place for love and understanding. I'm wishing you lots of good luck and sending positive energy for good scan results.  Please know that things will get easier. Love, Renee",
