I came to this site back in march after a SBE turned into an ultrasound which turned into a needle biopsy which turned into an excisional biopsy. results then were complex fibroadenoma with sclerosing adenosis.  i went a couple of weeks ago for my yearly and my doc found 2 more lumps.  I met with the surgeon yest.  who is referring me for an ultrsound.  i know the statistics that 80% of all lumps come back benign.  however, all that keeps running through my head is this will be the 7th biopsy (if it gets that far) that I will have had... aren't the odds gonna eventually catch up with me?  I am so sorry this is so long.  I try to keep my mind off of it but...  also, i know that sclerosing adenosis is not an indicator of cancer or precancerous but I was wondering how often it appeared along side cancer.. anyone know?  thanks for taking  the time to listen to the incoherent ramblings of someone who probably is just a hyprocondriact(sp)  thanks again Log in to post a reply",

I had the u/s this morning and everything was ok.. i will just go back in 6 months and then every year after (can't wait) I just feel everytime I turn around they are finding \"something\" in my breasts and because I am so young I just know that there will that day when I run out of good news. i know I am kinda a worry-wart.. anywho, thanks again to everyone and I wish everyone a LONG and happy life AWB~ I hope your results are B9 and you can breath again (at least for 6 more months)",

      "Content": "nolechic wrote: I found a lump in my left breast in early March. Went to my gyno who then referred me for an ultrasound which then turned into a needle biopsy. The morning of my biopsy I acutally found another lump in the other breast. I asked the radiolist(sp) if he could look at that one, he agreed and than requested a biospy for it as well. They called me the next day and told me the lump its self was a complex fibroadenom which on its own is fine just puts me at a higher risk. BUT then he tells me the cells surrounding the are of concern so I am scheduled for surgery this friday (the 13th yikes) and naturally because I have the worst luck ever, I developed a hematoma after the first biopsy so they will have to do a needle localization prior to surgery to locate the spot. I keep telling myself I am but am pretty sure I don't beleive myself or I wouldn't keep ending up at websites like this.. UGH! Log in to post a reply",
