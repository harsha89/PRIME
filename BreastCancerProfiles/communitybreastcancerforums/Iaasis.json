On the good side, I've learned so very much from reading this wonderful site.  The priimary doctor made me feel so hopeless but now I'm seeing a lot of you wonderful ladies have been living with stage IV for years, that gives me a great deal of hope and I am so thankful to be blessed with your courage and information.  So thank you all!",

How to explain this all to my 5 year old?  My mother lives with me so I'm thankful that I'll be there to help her through this, I just hope I can stay strong now for her. Log in to post a reply",

(Anyone but me concerned yet?)  So, bless her pea pickin heart she said she would have someone call us for the appointment. So we get home and we get the call and are told before she can start chemo she has to take a class?  (Really, a class?)  So this girl says \"I have an opening for a class on November 29th\".  Really?  November, are you sure?  She giggles and says \"Oh wait, December 29th; Oh no wait there's no openings for that.  How about January 15?\"  At this point the cute is over for me, I then remind her that the doctor wanted my mom to START chemo in the next few days.  She tells me we HAVE to do the class first.  I advise her she needs to find a class sooner then.  She tells me it's the only one she has, we continue to go around until she gets me her supervisor.  She had a bit more intelligence to work with and found another class in a different office for this coming Monday. Has anyone else taken this class?  I mean if you have to have chemo you have to have chemo.  I suppose the real purpose of the class is to tell us what to expect but if no one handles chemo the same then what is it really going to tell us?  I'm already getting frustrated with these people and am about to suggest to my mother to go somewhere else.  SIGH",
