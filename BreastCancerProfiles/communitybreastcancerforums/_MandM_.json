Over the past few weeks I've been feeling a slight burning/tingling sensation in my right breast. I freaked out and started performing back to back exams and i'm sure that didn't help. I have since stopped, tried to get a grip, and scheduled my annual mammogram. Intake scheduled me for a diagnostic exam w 3D mammo and ultrasound because of my concerns. My breast are extremely dense, and i'm now more suspicious of the letdown feeling, so I googled it. I'm sad to hear the feeling can be linked to cancer. My exam is scheduled for next week, two weeks post hysterectomy (I still have one ovary, but have been perimenopausal for a year now). I hope the feeling is indeed hormonal, even the tingling I'm feeling. Question, are there any other tests I should look into other than the 3D mammo and ultrasound?",
