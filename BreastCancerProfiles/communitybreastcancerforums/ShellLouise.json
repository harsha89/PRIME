I had a 2cm cyst aspirated in that area and it hasn't made a difference after 2 days. Breast surgeon said it wasn't related and says it's from underwire bras. So I'm to only wear sports bras for 3 months and see how I go. Has anyone else been told this? Thanks, Shell Log in to post a reply",

I have fibrocystic dense breasts, and felt a new lump a month ago. Had a mammo and U.S. and it was all clear. At the area of concern, there wasn't anything found, (possibly felt a duct they said) but other areas showed cysts. Since then I've still had a sore armpit, intermittent pain in the same spot where it feels like a very small lump (not picked up on the US) and now I've had 2 occasions of small wet spots of nipple discharge I noticed on my pyjamas this weekend. I guess my question is, is clear discharge something to be concerned about and I guess I just wanted to say yep I'm a bit worried too! I'm 46 and had a hysterectomy 6 months ago for an estrogen dominant uterus condition. Still have my ovaries. (But no periods. Woohoo!) :) Log in to post a reply",
