On the table 50 minutes in \"the position.\"  Was told I could not have a break for my arms as that would mean starting all over. During my time on the table I could hear the techs paging my oncologist over and over and over to come to the simulation room.  I'm not sure if he ever showed up.  I did finally hear the tech page for a doesimitrist to call or come to the simulation room.  Somebody tell me what that was all about.  I know what I think, but want to know what you all think.   I was in so much pain at the finish that I cried for 30 minutes before I could drive my car.  I was also told not to even consider using anything on my chest...just to leave it alone.  She said, \"you won't need anything until at least the end of three weeks.\"  I have 7 round pieces of tape over all of my marks.  I was told that if the time comes to use a lotion that I was to stay 2 inches away from all the tape circles.  Now... they are scattered all over my left chest wall with one on the right side.  How could I possibly use anything and stay 2 inches away from all of the marks????  Help you all....I'm kind of freaking about this. Had my first actual tx yesterday (Friday).  Again, a long time on the table because they take a lot of pictures first and then treat.  The tech said they would repeat the picture taking every 7-10 days.  Total time in the position yesterday, 35 minutes. Diane...If I had 2 busy children I wouldn't even consider working 32 hours.  I think you're very smart to ease back into the work place and still give yourself time for family.  I guess I will have to wait and see what my fatigue level is to really determine if I'll be able to continue my hours.  Kajo....So glad your surgeon called and relieved your mind!  Isn't it awful the places our minds carry us to when we're in panic mode?  Only someone who has had our experiences would truly understand that feeling.  My best to everyone, June PS...Hey DeAnn...glad to see an old 'neighbor.'  :) ",

I was also told by my Rad. Onc. that smaller, thinner chested woman don't seem to have as much skin reaction.  I am not large chested but without my bra I suddenly have 3 navels!!!!  Anybody know what I mean?  :>   There is no way possible I could go without a bra and work!  Give me a break please!  I'm looking forward to new companions on yet another journey for all of us.  I'll post again after Friday. Best to all...... June",

KarenX......Just wanted to comment on your comment regarding your company that can't accomodate a reduced work schedule.  Are you in the states?  If so the American Disabilities Act covers you in the workplace.  It clearly states that cancer and cancer treatment is a disability and your employer must make accomodations for you.  Google their site and read more if you're interested.  It gives clear examples of the type of accomodations that are considered normal and justified.  I'm not trying to tell you to start a war with your employer but if you're an American citizen you do have some rights.  Good Luck to you. My best to all and lets keep writing. June",
