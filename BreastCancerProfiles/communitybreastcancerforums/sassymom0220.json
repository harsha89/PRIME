I made appt with PCP who said she didn't feel any lumps but was a bit baffled by this indent and has scheduled me for a breast ultrasound on weds 6/12. I was told if anything is spotted, a mammogram will follow the same day. I have been researching and haven't found anything close to the indent I have. It is almost a perfect vertical line that runs along the right side of my areola. It starts about an inch above the areola and goes down about 3 inches. The first inch is the deepest and widest, then thins out slightly the rest of the way. Its very hard to see while standing normal but is extremely noticeable when I start to raise my arms. Sometimes it seems like the deepest part has a tad bit of shadowing but I can't be too sure because it isn't very dark. No other issues with breast other than this weird indent. Literally looks like I leaned against a counter and it left an almost perfect line. Left breast looks same as it always has. No BC history on dad's side, Great Grandmother had BC on mom's side. No trauma, no procedures, weight has been consistent, never really breastfed (tried but milk supply caused issues). I'm not stressing because chances are its nothing serious and if it is, well, I'll deal with it. Just trying to reach out and see if ANYONE has had or has heard of an indentation like mine, because I can't find anything at all. Just want to get an idea of what it could be and have some sort of knowledge before my test is completed and results come in. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.
