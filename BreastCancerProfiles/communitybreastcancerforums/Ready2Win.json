They called and said everything was stable. Well when I read it the report say there is no FDG uptake in the liver and one tumor cannot be measured and the other is 18mm. Well that is different than 6 weeks ago scans. So I would call that regression not stable. Thoughts???",

I cant believe the company that I have been so loyal and dedicated to has treated us some badly.  Did I mention that I didnt take one day off through all my treatments?  I am so hurt.  I need help with the kids.  The side effects from the treatments have me very achy and sore.  The damage to my hip has me walking with a limb and my entire left leg is numb.  I dont know what to do but I want Verizon upper management to be aware of this without negatively impacting our jobs.  We still have to work for them.  Any suggestions?

Now I just got a copy of my PET from last week and I find out that I have 2 lessions on my liver 1 on my hip that I knew about and \"increased FDG AVIDITY of BONY METASTASIS INVOLVING THE T4 SPINOUS PROCESS AND LEFT LAMINA\"  What does that even mean? WHere is that in my body? I am waiting to get into a trial comparing TDM1 and Xeolda&Tykerb.  ANyway.... I have been trying to watch what I eat and juice alot but at this point I am about to have a bacon cheese burger.  I hate this disease!

I am on TDM1 since and the liver is almost clear. 1 tumor left only 18mm. It is given every 3 weeks by a 1/2 infusion. It is very well tolerated with minimal side effects. It hardly slows me down.
