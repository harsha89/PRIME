As the doctor told me not to directly remove it instead observe it for 6 months. If it getting enlarged progressively, he then considered to remove it. But today i feel like its getting closer around my nipple (probably 2 fingers away under the nipple) but thankfully i don't feel any pain or sore. Does anybody feel the same? Should i worry regarding this matter? And should i undergo surgery? Words would be helpful ðŸ˜ž Thank you.. Log in to post a reply",
