It was in response to Surgarpea.  (deep breath) well, I would write it over but...to be honest with you ...I was surprising myself by even writing it the first time.  I am sure everyone can relate to loosing something like that.  It's just annoying.  ok i am over it:) Well, I will pray that your \"armpit\"  is not cancer.  I am glad you are being an activist with your health.  Please get it checked out throughly!!! My cancer journey started with an \"armpit\" issue.  & that's  all I thought it really was.  Listen to your body. Is all I can say to you.  Not just the \"good news the doctor might say\" ...and we all would like to belive and call it a day.  Like others said everyone is different.  But my story starts with the armpit and that is why this question caught my eye.  I was thinking....If i would have heard of someone else with my story...I would have made sure I had it checked out right away and would have taken it more seriously, then what I did...when i noticed a raised swollen armpit...(that I thought and was told...\"it's just an ingrown hair'  I am new to this bc.org.  I would like to say thank u...  I am finding I am  encouraged by all the Strong, kind, helpful women who post their \"realness\" in here.  Thank you.  ( I am  still trying to figure out how it works exactly....but I am glad i am here. Sugar p.....truly wishing the best to you.  i hope it nothing.  Praying for all of u!  keep positive and remember God is in Control. Peace, Divine www.caringbridge.org/visit/divineintervention",
