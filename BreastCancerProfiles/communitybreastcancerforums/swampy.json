On Thursday, last week they couldn't get my mold on because there was so much fluid build up in the seroma. They did my tx that day without the mold. I told my technician I felt like I was having \"unprotected sex\" because  I really didn't think they knew for sure where they were zapping me. Friday, I found a doctor that will work with me in keeping the seroma drained. The mold fit just fine for tx. The doctor put me in a compression bandage (Ace bandage) around my chest to try to keep the seroma from refilling. It seems to be working, but I will know for sure when I go in this afternoon. I'm supposed to wear this thing for a week to 10 days. It makes it a pain to apply the Aloe Vera and I need someone to help me \"wrap up\" again. hugs, sistahs!",

I had rads Monday at 2:00 PM then drove to Tampa to spend the night with my sister so I could do Herceptin at Moffitt South Tuesday morning. I was in terrible pain Sunday and Monday nights because I had developed a seroma in my right mastectomy incision and axilla area. I didn't know what it was, but my oncologist's PA looked at it and called my surgeon and got me an appointment at his office as soon as I could get there. The PA at the surgeons office drained 230ccs of fluids from the seroma! by needle aspiration. Then it was in the car and playing Mario Andretti to get back to Sebring (125 miles from Tampa) to do rads on Tuesday at 3:00. When I got there the machine was down!!!  ARRRRGH Here it is Thursday and the seroma is filled up again. At rads today they couldn't even get my mold on so they did radiation without it. My Rad Onco called my local surgeon (who did my gall bladder removal several years ago) to see if he would work with me in keeping the seroma drained. The surgeon said NO (the SOB). Some excuse about not wanting to touch another surgeon's 'field of operation'... Probably more like he's pissed he didn't do the mastectomy and make his big bucks. If this thing keeps filling up every two days there is no way I can continue to drive back and forth to Tampa every other day to get it drained so I can get my rad mold on. Draining is a very simple procedure... wipe down with lidocaine then remove the fluid with a needle. I went to my family doctor who called a friend of his who is willing to work with me and it is right on the way to the rads clinic. It's a monkey wrench in the works, but ya do what ya gotta do. hugs, gals....",

I''ve got 7 more tx's to go, but have been put on hold for a full week because my skin has broken down so bad (under arm and along mastectomy surgical line). My under arm looks like a badly burned marshmellow. My rad onc prescribed Sulfa Silverdiazine cream with instructions to debride the area with a mixture of 50% hydrogen peroxide and water using a gauze or cotton pad before applying the cream 3 times a day. Dead, black skin just rolls off on the cotton pads and it is gross! My entire left chest is itchy and the \"new\" underlying skin \"stings\" when anything touches it. The sulfa cream does nothing to ease the pain and itching and I'm not supposed to use any other remedy like Aloe while on this regeime. Vicodin helps me sleep at night. I return Monday, but my rad onco will not be in until Tuesday so I have a feeling I won't be able to resume treatments until he checks me out. Another day lost...sigh. I just want to get this over with. I have no idea how my skin will react when tx's start again.  I dread the thoughts of doing 1 or 2 tx's then laying off for 3 or 4 days then doing 1 or 2 more until the process is completed. I also thought I had done my last \"double duty day\" (Herceptin in Tampa in the morning and rads back home the same afternoon), but now it looks like I will have to pull the hat trick off one more time because my next Herceptin is scheduled 12/22. I don't know how much this 67 (68 next month) year old body can take.  Thanks for letting me vent.",

I spent a week in a compression bandage for a seroma that devloped along my right (non cancer) mastectomy incision line. I'm hoping that the fluid build up has stopped and I won't need it drained again. I have found a wonderful device to help spread the pressure of a seat belt across my chest area. It is a heavy duty nylon thingy that you slip the seat belt through and secure with self contained velcro tabs to hold it in place. I got it at an auto supply store for about $15.00. It's easy to move from car to car or driver to passenger side.  It was designed for short people to keep the seat belt riding up on their neck. I love it. I've conquered my fear of the whole rads process by asking questions and more questions. (I'm such a geek.) My technician is wonderful about answering them and seems to take pleasure in educating me. My macine is one that rotates around my body. It makes four stops, but I wanted to know why she flipped the lense after position #3. She showed me these shaded areas along the edge of the lens and explained that those edges deflect the rays and cause them to curve along the shape of my chest. The angel is reversed after stops #1, #2 and #3 (left side) which has to curve up and she has to change it to curve down (right side) for stop #4. She also explained about the \"gel pack\" she lays on top of my mold for \"shots\" #3 and #4. It acts as extra layers of skin and fat so that the dept of ray penetration can be adjusted so as not to adversely affect lung tissue. My technician will let me use my iPod, but I find I'm only on the table long enough to listen to one or two songs so it's hardley worth it. She does let me know the times she's going to have me on the table longer for taking xrays or films so that's the only time I use the iPod. The one thing I haven't heard anyone else say is if they feel dizzy when they sit up after treatment?",

My surgeon (Dr. Charles E. Cox formerly head of breast cancer research at Tampa's Moffitt Cancer Center) is now convincened that this is the way to go. He's been holding fund raisers to buy the new equipment for his new location (Morsani Center).

My tumor was 4.5cm when first measured. Even though the surgical pathology (after chemo) showed no cancer in breast or nodes, my \"fate\" was set from the start. The need for radiation is not determined by where you \"end up\" after chemo/surgery, but by where you started. I'm comfortable with that explanation so onward we go to radiation. My thanks to all who have posted their experiences here. I have a better understanding of what is going to happen in that \"lonely room\".
