I met Eileen, she's a breast cancer patient advocate for the medical center and she was with me all the way. I got a copy of my Path Report: Final Diagnosis: right breast mass, 9 o'clock, 3mm from the nipple, biopsy - Benign breast tissue with prominent fibrosis. Comment: A fibroadenoma is in the differential diagnosis. The surgeon told me that it's all up to me. I can ask to get it taken out right now or just leave it there and come back for my 6 month follow-up. Either way. If it increase its size (from 7mm) then it would be a good idea to take it out. I'm pretty much in pending mode right now since I'm waiting to find out if there is BC in my father's side. If there is, I would be more inclined to have the surgery since it's the only way to be 100% sure. Thanks for all the response!",

I had biopsy that same day. The Dr. kept on reassuring me that it's most probably benign (fibroadonema) since I'm 22 yrs old and have no family history. I got the result earlier today and yes, it's benign. Now I have two choices, to get it taken out or to just leave it there and just monitor if it gets bigger. As of now, I'm waiting to get an appointment for surgery consult. I just really don't know what to do... Log in to post a reply",

I'll just keep on doing my monthly self-exam and hope for the best. One more thing I want to add is that I've been using birth control pill (Ortho Tri-Cyclen) for about 3 years now. I thought, based on product description, that it reduces the chance of having fibroadenoma but it's looking like the other way around. What do you think?",
