To try and put your mind at rest a bit I have suffered since the age of 15 with many breast lumps, all of which have been benign cysts etc!  There are lots of reasons why a lump would just appear in your breast they could be cysts, abcesses, benign tumours, fibroidadenomas etc and the likelyhood is it is one of those easy to deal with conditions!  It is useless saying try not to worry because until you have been thoroughly checked out you will, but that is the important thing, getting checked out!  Never assume it is not a problem until you know for sure and try to think it is benign until someone tells you differently   Easier said than done on that last bit I know.  I hope this has helped and the women on these boards are amazing at offering advice and support and are much more knowledgeable than me so I am sure you will get lots of other posts.  Please let us all know how you get on and am praying for you xo ",
