I have read so much, I realized my Radiation Oncologist knows less than me in regards to my particular kind of breast cancer and also most definitely my particular case. I realized she had absolutely zero interest in fully informng me, its something we all have to do for ourselves, each cancer is as different as our own personalities. I am refusing radiotherapy, but that is just me and I advise no one to do anything except find out all that they can about the particulars of their own case, statistics that apply to them in particular and ALSO the combinations of therapies doctors are offering - they forget some important details sometimes, which is what your question is about.   My blog is all about my decision and why, it may or may not be of interest, but doctors sure can be arbitrary and disinterested, so don't preclude that they care. Its clear to me, many don't.  nzmermaid.blogspot.co.nz ",

You will find a lot of figures on there about risks.  There is a .05-1% risk of lung cancer induced by radiotherapy, which wouldn't normally show up for ten years afterwards. There is a risk of luekaemia also, but that tends to show up sooner starting at three years, once again, very small risk. There is an increase of heart attack which is more, depends on your current state. A woman with no heart problems aged 50 has a 1.9% chance of dying from a heart attack before age 80. Radiotherapy adds 2.4 percent and 3.4 risk to this. nzmermaid.blogspot.co.nz  My blog is relevant to my situation, but there is tons of information about radiotherapy on there. ",

I have so many questions AFTER I left the RO and I couldn't think what to ask when I was with her in the appointment. I am very anxious now as I don't understand the treatment I am getting. Why I am getting 3gys a day, when most people get 2, for example.  What are the advantages of the shorter, stronger radiation other than using less time and petrol and less hospital resources?  I go for my simulation on Wednesday.",

I found a mistake on my histology report which has upped my risk artificially, as in the Nottingham Prognostic score, someone added an extra digit to it (.32 +1 +1=3.32), so putting me in the moderate risk range when my real score is 2.32 and the radiologist is basing the treatment at least in part on this?  I can't even get hold of anyone, so left a message to say I won't be at my appointment. I'm not going thru with it until this has been looked at.",

I really appreciate it  This is one place I can talk about it without boring people who are in a different headspace, as it can be in the real world. Like you, RunFree I was more afraid of Tamoxifen than radiotherapy, because I fear depression more than cancer, so I was quite relieved when my surgeon said I didn't need to take it. I had no idea how bad clinical depression was until I got it and I never want it again.  Runfree, you said you enjoyed rads in a curious way - I know what you mean, so far I have found a way to \"enjoy\" each step in the process so far, count my blessings and finding silver linings, which there are - for example, both boobs are the same size now as my surgeon took big margins from my larger breast that had the tumour, so that worked out nicely. I also kind of enjoyed the processes of the operation, and found the nuclear medine scan interesting, even the hook wire on the morning of the op, watching them put the wire into the tumour on the screen. I hope I find rads as interesting, and the machine. But having got off the Tamoxifen now I am wondering about radiotherapy? Yes, partly fear, but especially worrying about overtreatment. When I was first diagnosed they said \"if you are going to get cancer, this is the one to get\". I had no idea what they meant except that the biopsy was very much grade one, low mitotic count, mild neomorphism. Post operation I read my histology thoroughly and found out I had tubular subtype of IDC, which is only 2% of cancers and not as well researched because numbers are smaller to get information from, but it appears it is about half as active as most grade 1 cancers. For example 30% of women having their sentinel lymph node removed will have something found in the node, but only 15% of women with tubular will have cancer in the lymph node. It rarely travels, but can kill, of course. Mine is absolutely typical right down to the description of the tumour and the fact that it was next to some cribriform in situ cancer, which brought up the actual area to 2cms in all (the tumour was 1.6). Its neomorphism had gone up a notch since the biopsy sample, so it was a 2 instead of 1 on the scale, but still put it all into the Grade 1 category, just.  This may be the reason why I have, what now seems to be, a lighter dose of radiotherapy coming up, but it is at a rather high daily dosage at 3 grays. And that can have a worse outcome ten years down the line, according to some research. But hearing what you are getting Runfree and comparing it to mine, seems to make a kind of sense, with your dot of bad stuff in the lymph node and my tumour being bigger, but a fairly slow cancer. Thanks very much for all your advice and encouragement (Cindy - thanks for your upbeat intro ). I think I will feel much more comfortable when I find out why exactly I have been given this particular regime. I will pester the Radiation Oncologist some more about \"why\". What is an MO? a medical oncologist? is this also a kind of doctor? what role do they play in treatment? My main problem is right now, a month on, my lymph node incision has only just healed over as it was infected and oozing up until a couple of days ago and now it looks settled down but has a really painful tender, very tight, hard lump around and adjacent to the incision site, as well as a strongly corded vein leaving that area running down the side. I feel like its all blocked up, or else the hard bit is indeed some more gunk trying to get out. Not sure what to do. Nurse said anti-biotics, my GP said hot salt water soaks - which got it to heal over but now something is trapped under the healed bit . . . our bodies can just get rid of stuff like that without it being lanced?  They won't give me radiotherapy if I am not completely healed. ",

I have been reading up all over the place and it seems I am getting quite a large dose, 3 weeks, 5 days per week of 3 gys followed by several boosts to bring it up to 56 gys - is this normal? I have read that these hyperfractionated schedules have worse fibrosis results down the line? I didn't think my prognosis warranted maximum radiation, but apparently 50 is \"young\" to get cancer. I am getting more and more fearful as it approaches. My technical run is next Wednesday. ",

I get the feeling that doctors tend to express their own personality a bit with their treatment regimes! for example the RO who told me what I was going to get, told me I should also be going on Tamoxifen - yet my quite relaxed surgeon said the benefits were small and that the drug had side effects so not worth it for me. It seems I would only get a reduction in reoccurence of 1.7%, yet the RO think I should be doing this (not really her department though). I am surprized at all the different things different medical people say.  I googled gys for breast cancer and mostly they seemed to be between 39 and 50 gys, so I wondered why my total was 56? but its good to know its just average?  I feel like I know nothing, and as someone else on this board said, information is almost given to us, who are receiving the treatments, on a \"need to know basis\". I do feel rather processed by the public health system (which is at least, free, in my country)",
