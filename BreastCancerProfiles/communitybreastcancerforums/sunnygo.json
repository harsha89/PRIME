I was diagnosed with IDC, HER2+, Stage II just about a year ago. By the time I went through neoadjuvant chemo and a unilateral mastectomy, I was Stage III. I had 3 lymph nodes (16 removed) and clear margins, but my tumor just didn't respond (like not at all: chemo, it laughed, what's that?) to treatment. Anyone else have that experience? Do you have a good explanation why some tumors don't respond? Finished up radiation in January and am on a clinical trial through the end of this year. The old joke about every headache is a brain tumor? Guess that's what I'm coping with right now, a lot of fear and anxiety that it will spread. It's a strange juxtaposition, to be \"getting on\" with life--feeling decent, making meatloaf, taking kids places--but not really know what's next. Do you get used to that? Best to you all!",
