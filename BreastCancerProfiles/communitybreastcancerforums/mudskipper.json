And I have had chronic mastectomy pain ever since. My diagnosis is Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome: http://www.cancerlynx.com/syndrome.html I have been in chronic pain every since my surgery.  In the past three years I have tried nerve pain meds, physical therapy, and acupuncture.  Unfortunately none of those have stopped my constant pain. And so out of desperation I decided to try nerve blocks. Yesterday I had my first round of blocks. Afterward I felt instant relief. Unforunately the Novacaine is fastly wearing off and I'm almost back where I started. But my doctor already told me in advance that I would need multiple injections 4 weeks in a row to calm my nerves. Regarding the injection site, I had some pain that felt like bruising last night but today it's completely gone. What have your doctors said about your pain? I hope it subsides soon!! Good luck! ",
