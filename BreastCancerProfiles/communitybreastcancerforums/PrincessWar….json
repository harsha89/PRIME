Nausea but no vomiting but I was loose with no control. Didn't dare leave the house for the next 5 days. Lost 8.5 pounds. Then that all stopped. I could eat and drink just fine and gained 1/2 the weight back. No problems with sores in my mouth probably because I wear dentures but rinsing your mouth frequently and driking with a straw helps with the metallic taste, Sleep has been a big problem for me and the Ativan isn't helping so I got a script for Restoril. I lost all of my hair on day 20, I had shaved it a month before so it was a surprise to have a storm of hair all around me on the bathroom floor. Had my second dose of Chemo 4/2/12 and today I will get Neulasta. My reconstruction is on hold until after the chemo and radiation are completed. I have stared a virtual support group out of my Facebook Page. We call ourselves Princess Warriors. Our Theme song is Staying Alive. I am Madmaw on Facebook but am considering creating a separate profile for the Princess Warriors. My Diagnois didn't load but it is isdc/idc 2cm, Stage II Grade 2, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+",
