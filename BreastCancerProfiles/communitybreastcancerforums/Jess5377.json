It doesn't make the wait any easier, but the biopsy has now been scheduled. It's Wednesday morning at 10:30 am. I'm hoping to have the results by Friday so I'm done with the waiting game. Lol. Thank you for telling me how yours went :)",

      "Content": "Jess5377 wrote: My name is Jess. I will be 24 next month. Last week while taking a shower I notice a lump on the top of my right breast. I've never noticed it before, however it is not small. My doctor sent me to have an ultrasound done, and I expected the results in a couple days. To my surprise, I got them right then and there. I knew this wasn't a cyst because it is not round or oval. It is also very hard. I have some medical knowledge so I had a general idea of what to look for on the screen, but I wasn't seeing what I expected to see. I asked the tech if she saw the mass, she said she could definitely feel it, but she needed the radiologist to look at it before anything could be said about it. She brings him in and he confirms that it's not a cyst. He then tells me that the mass has no definitive edges and it's too dense for the ultrasound waves to see it clearly. And there is obviously some signs of abnormal tissue. I'm now waiting on a core needle biopsy to be scheduled. Anyone have anything similar to this? What was the outcome or diagnosis? Any info is helpful and appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
