The BMX pathology of the RIGHT breast showed 3 sites .2, .3 and 1.8cm and a positive node...they are doing more tests to see if it was affected by the chemo at all. A good point was that she had large clear margins all around and clear vascular channels Her Dr is thinking more chemo, then radiation ...but not sure what kind? Anyone heard of more chemo after chemo and a BMX? Log in to post a reply",

(Very fast recovery!) The pathology we just got back showed 3 sites in the RIGHT breast all under 1 cm, 1 node involved with clear margins lymphovascular invasion in both, the breast tissue as a whole had clear margins.  She is slated for radiation but this news has taken us aback...any thoughts? Would treatment change?  Prognosis? The news really threw us for a loop as we thought we were entering the clear! Log in to post a reply",

The original tumor was 2.1cm, the 3 sites they found in the other breast are .1, .3 and .9 mm.  So I guess that makes sense they weren't found. I don't know what that additional node involvement or the presence off vascular invasion all means now that the breasts are gone with clear margins....I guess the surprise is that cells remained after chemo...and what does that mean...sigh",
