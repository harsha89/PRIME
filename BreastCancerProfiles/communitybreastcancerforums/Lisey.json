Studies show many women are over treated with chemo - and that is where the genetic Oncotype or Mammaprint tests help. Once you know the hormone status of your tumor, you'll have more to go off of.

Grade 1 and 3 show more reliablity. For example, one major study sent the same samples to different top pathologist and no two pathologist could agree on a Ki score. One specimen had several say it was a 5% and others say it was 35%. My oncologist completely disregarded my 'high' ki score and the mammaprint proved I was low risk. However, we found very high inter-observer variabilities (Kappa 0.04-0.14) in the read-outs of the G2 carcinomas. It was not possible to explain the inconsistencies exclusively by any of the following factors: (i) pathologists' divergent definitions of what counts as a positive nucleus (ii) the mode of assessment (counting vs. eyeballing), (iii) immunostaining technique, and (iv) the selection of the tumor area in which to count. Despite intensive confrontation of all participating pathologists with the problem, inter-observer agreement did not improve when the same slides were re-examined 4 months later (Kappa 0.01-0.04) and intra-observer agreement was likewise poor (Kappa 0.00-0.35). Assessment of mid-range Ki-67-LI suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability. Oncologists should be aware of this caveat when using Ki-67-LI as a basis for treatment decisions in moderately differentiated breast carcinomas. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225098187_How_Reliable_Is_Ki-67_Immunohistochemistry_in_Grade_2_Breast_Carcinomas_A_QA_Study_of_the_Swiss_Working_Group_of_Breast-_and_Gynecopathologists",

(with obvious we're not doc disclaimers) They tested my biopsy, not my tumor for ER/PR.. so the numbers at my tagline are based on the IHC biopsy numbers. However, the OncotypeDX shows widely different percentages (me thinks).. but I can't figure out how to actually translate the Onco numbers into percentages. I've done some google digging and most say the IHC is more accurate. I asked my doc about the disparity and she blew off the oncotype numbers saying the IHC numbers were more important. Here's my numbers: IHC (from Biopsy)_OncotypeDX (from section) ER= 95% _______8.8 Positive (in the positive range it lands about here on the scale l__________Y______________________l - certainly doesn't look 95% to me. PR= 5% ________6.6 Positive (in the positive range it lands about here on the scale l_______Y_________________________l - looks more than 5% to me.  So I'm now growing concerned that maybe I'm much less ER+ than I thought, which would mean that Oncotype score of 20 and Ki-67 of 30-35% is saying chemo is warranted moreso than I thought. I figured I'd just double down on the estogen blockers if the mammoprint is high, but if the ER is lower, then maybe I should reconsider the chemo. If the damn IHC was done on the tumor rather than the biopsy, I would feel better too.",

The article describes the results of a Phase III trial following almost 7000 patients worldwide. In 98% of the cases for which MammaPrint deemed chemo unnecessary, the Distant Metastasis Free Interval (DMFI) was achieved. This is the equivalent of a primary endpoint to evaluate the prognosis and benefit of a typical drug. Amazingly, MammaPrint was able to evaluate these as a result of not using a drug (chemotherapy) in order to distinguish cases that don't require it. The test, as described in the journal article, analyses a sequence of 70 genes, and it can be tacked on to the standard procedure for identifying patients in need of chemotherapy. The team of researchers found that approximately 46% of women with breast cancer at high clinical risk may not need this highly toxic therapy, and this new technology would save them the physical and financial burdens of undergoing chemotherapy.",

Apparently they match for Positive V. Negative around 95% of the time, and in the 5% that don't match, the Oncotype is usually the one that's wrong. If you look here... it shows that a lot of women had even LOWER oncotype scores and were still considered high ER+ by the IHC. Makes me feel helluva better to know that I shouldn't look at the Oncotype Score as a percentage of my ER. PLEASE someone correct me if I'm off base here. If I have a lower ER, I will do the damn Chemo. I'm banking on the high ER+ level that my doc told me to use.    http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v25/n6/full/modpathol2011219a.html",

They do the mammaprint results twice to confirm, I've had both the oncotype and mammaprint done. My oncotype was intermediate and my mammaprint low risk (which was surprising to me given the ki value - which the doc told me to disregard as I was a grade 2)... In any case, I would trust the mammaprint. Juniper, as a grade 3 / high risk mammaprint, I'd seriously consider chemo unless you have other medical conditions which would change your risk.

It's saying low clinical risk (by the standard definiition of size, nodes, grade) do not benefit from Chemo, so mammaprint is unnecessary since even if it came back high risk they wouldn't benefit? That doesn't make sense to me. People classified as low risk cliniically but high risk via mammaprint should have chemo, right? Therefore if they don't get the mammaprint - they wouldn't know. What about someone like me, classified low risk, but got an intermediate oncotype... Mammaprint I was low risk, but another poster with my identical stats (low risk clinicially, intermediate oncotype) had the mammaprint and was high risk, so did chemo. I trust the genomic testing more than classical staging.. so I'm not sure why they are saying not to do testing if you are appearing low risk.",

I hated it... 3 weeks later, it was WORSE than at first. So I had them remove the TEs and now I'm 8 days out and doing well with no pain, just soreness and tightness... no bra of death, no stabbing.. more like a sunburn on my chest. Also, I had to have my husband and mother forklift me to a sitting position a lot and they had to help me for about 2 weeks in that going from laying down to getting up. I'm doing better now, but still have my husband help get my bed into 'office chair' mode every morning before he leaves for work because I'm not allowed to raise my arms over 90 degrees or lift anything more than 5lbs. If she's on oxycontin or any codeine she can't drive. I was left alone, but wasn't expected to do anything for 2 weeks.. my mother would bring me drinks and food.. I just worked from my bed. (I couldn't move due to the TEs hurting so bad).. I've been told 1 week after surgery is when you just being to start stretching, but I have a small seroma, so I'm delaying it until it's gone... I still don't do much and it's been 1 month since the first MX/TEs disaster and 8 days since they were removed.",

It said that switching to an OS/AI really only helps in a statistical way younger women who have more aggressive cancer and need chemo. Those premenapausal women who have less aggressive cancer and no node involvement are fine on just Tamoxifen. There are a lot of reasons to stay on Tamox versus an AI as well. Tamox doesn't have bone issues and still gives you some estrogen. As long as your uterus stays good and your side effects are mild, my MO recommends staying on Tamox for me rather than switching. The Study regarding intermediate oncotypes isn't out yet. (TailorX) HOWEVER, the information you've been told isn't accurate. Oncotype is still effective for younger women and MOs do rely on it. My 20 score (I'm age 41) had my MO excited that I didn't need chemo - but it was my choice. I got the mammaprint as a second opinion and it confirmed I was low risk.",

      "Content": "Aug 4, 2016 02:13PM - edited Aug 4, 2016 02:14PM by Lisey Hi Everyone. I called and spoke to the chief Pathologist at Agendia. She told me they test all samples TWICE to confirm the status. (including mine which was only 0.009 outside of the borderline) If there is a discrepancy, they test it 2 more times after that. She confirmed to me I'm in the low zone (twice) and while she agreed that logically, my numbers are 'more risky' than someone not so close to the zero, but she said the numbers they give are AVERAGES for the entire spectrum of Low Risk with the variances given. She also mentioned the numbers are for no chemo or hormonal therapy, so there's that. So in a way, our assumption that those of us closer to zero are right to think we have more risk (in the Low Risk group) than someone farther from zero. It would be inverse for the High Risk group, is accurate.. but they don't have a way of quantifying that difference so they just use averages. I think it said 1.3% (0-3.1%) for the first 5 years for Low Risk. FFPE samples are only for 5 years at this point, since the technology is more recent. She also said that Agendia has phased out their Targetprint as well because they are doing the 'mammoprint/blueprint' suite for everyone instead. I am glad I was tested more than once and both times was in low risk. But my risk is probably more in the 3.1% rather than 1.3%.. but I\"m good with no chemo.",

I'm so much looser than I was last week - there's just a couple of stuck points now.. that they will focus in on. I can almost raise my arms straight up over my head on my own now. The lead therapist also explained that sometimes lymphatic fluid gets blocked due to not being as mobile and while it's not technically LE, it DOES cause pain and makes the muscle not be able to heal. They work the muscles but also my arms and such to really get the lymphatic fluids moving again. When you've not really done a ton of normal motions with your arms for a few months like I have, the fluids stagnate and cause problems. I\"m really a believer in what they do. ",

Plus they gave me suggestions because they specialize in cancer / LE healing that my plastics nurse didn't. They told me NOT to do the exercises the nurse told me to do, as they will upset my muscles. I'm going back to them on Monday and will probably have a couple more sessions. I'm very very impressed with these specialists... they didnt' 'rub' or do any of the typical massage.. they basically pushed in and held... and had me put my hand on my forehead while lying down and they worked all the scar tissue with very gentle pressure.

I'm STILL feeling so much better... so I really think this is the trick for me to get rid of the iron bra. It's amazing how much less tight I feel and the metal cookie sheet stuck to my chest is GONE. Also the main exercise she said not to do was wall leaning. Where you lean with your hand out 90 degrees on a wall. She said if your hand is in an incorrect position it could harm your muscles. She said to stick with spider wall climbing, but no leaning weight into it. One exercise she told me to do is to lay down and hold a dowel with both hands and raise it over my head, but allow gravity to help with doing this lying down. 3 times a day, 3 reps, 3 seconds each time.",
