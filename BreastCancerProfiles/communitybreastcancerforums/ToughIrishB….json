      "Content": "May 2, 2011 04:10AM - edited May 2, 2011 02:21PM by ToughIrishBroad I'm new to this forum.  Wish we could all have met under different circumstances!  I just started Halaven on Thursday - first dose.  Anyone have/had any intense pelvic pain with it?  If it keeps up, I'm calling doc tomorrow. My oncologist is so excited about this drug - hope he's right - this time.....  My original diagnosis was in 1996 - 2.5 cm tumor ER+ at age 37.  Did 4 months of Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  Was good for 7 years then BAM - the news/phone call you never want.  The tumor markers are on the rise.  Scans show activity in the supraclavicular/mediastinal area.  Biopsy shows same breast cancer - and later determine it is also HER2/neu +.  Since 2003 I have been on so many chemos and had radiation twice - first to the neck and chest area in 2006 just to zap some of those pesky nodes that kept resurfacing since 2003.  I think I've done most of the chemos out thre but my oncologist (prior to now) kept telling me there was a whole arsenal left to try.  Over the years I've been on and off and on again Herceptin.  Sometimes mixed in with something else - sometimes just by itself on the rocks!  Cancer would usually leave me alone for a year or so in between recurrences - am now on my 6th!   August 2009 went to ER with abdominal pain, extreme fatigue.  CT of abdomen showed pericardial and pleural effusions. Admitted and sent to OR next day for pericardial window, had VT treatment with Amiodarone during pericardial evacuation.  800cc of pericardial fluid drained and 2 liters of pleural in the OR - coded on table.  Returned to CCU with left chest tube and rigth sided portable Pleuravac.  In CCU for 10 more days. Post op LV EF lows 20s. EF rebounded 48 hours to 55%.  Developed acute SVC Syndrome post-op - hands, upper torso and face extremely swollen and bluish in color.  CT of chest showed large left subclavian thrombus - treated with Heparin and discharged with daily Arixtra injections.  They didn't expect me to walk out of that hospital but I did.  Pericardial effusion positve for malignancy, pleural fluid was benign.  Had Pleuravac in for another 4 months until fluid down below 50 cc/day.  Put on Xeloda and Tykerb - then switched to a combination of other drugs.  First PET/CT scan was clean, so was second - 3rd not so good.  Cancer was spreading even while on chemo - frustrating!!  In December, 2010 5 cm mass shows on cervix/uterus - biopsy shows from original breast cancer but yet it is ER-.  Plus mass is putting a kink in my right utereter and kidney is blocked - nephrostomy tube put in January, 2011.  Has it morphed into something else over the years?  Apparently, the original recurrence in 2003 was part ER+ and part ER-.  They treated me drugs that work well with ER+ I guess because this thing is now ER-.  Started 3 weeks of 5FU and 26 radiation treatments in January - they were confident they were going to be able to treat this thing.  It only shrunk a bit and latest PET/CT shows the cancer has continued to spread - now starting to show up in bones/hip, internal mammary chain and the heart.  CT and TEE shows a 3cm mass extending into the right inferior vena cava.  I go to oncologist this past Monday figuring he's coming in to have \"the conversation.\"  But, he's hot on Halaven - mixing it with Herceptin and Arixtra again (to prevent anything breaking off and going into the lungs).  So, we'll see.....  They didn't expect me to survive in 2009, so what the heck.  I say, if there's a drug out there that I haven't tried yet, bring it on.  I keep reminding them you just don't get me - everytime I get knocked down I'm gong to keep getting back up..... until I just can't anymore....  Best wishes to all who are going through this horrible disease and to those who love, care for, and support us during this journey!!  Enjoy your day - it's a beautiful one here where I am......  There's a great Hooters Song called I'm Alive - YOUTUBE it and listen to the words......   I'll give you some anyway...... I've got a condition for which there is no cure. I'm in a position that everyone prays for. Got a sound in my head that could wake up the dead. Like The Who singing Summertime Blues. Got no thorn in my side, got no secrets to hide. I'm completely and utterly amused. I'M ALIVE..... I'M ALIVE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY I'M ALIVE..... I'M ALIVE AND WHEREEVER I GO IT'S AMAZING TO KNOW I'M ALIVE! <SMILE>  So sorry for the length of this!  I do tend to go on and on and on.....",
