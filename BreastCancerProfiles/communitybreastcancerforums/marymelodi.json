Anyway, she invites anyone on radiation to ask her questions about it. Right now she is on vacation and some questions are piling up, but the beginning of the thread has information that is useful and when she gets back, she probably get caught up. Check it out.",

She had lung cancer, but was never a smoker, and was only diagnosed last fall. I listened to the story on NPR on the way home from work and got incredibly sad. Her son is only 12-years-old and now has lost both father and mother in less than 18 months. I know it wasn't breast cancer, but cancer was her killer and I can't help feeling some of my own fears wiggle their nasty little heads in the back of my mind. My husband shut me down when I tried to talk about it. \"It has nothing to do with you,\" he said. I must have touched on his own fears by speaking of my own. He cannot talk about \"what if\" in relation to me and cancer and death. In the story, they said she had been telling everyone she was doing fine and beating the odds, but then in the last 2 weeks, she became very ill. So, I thought you all would understand how I feel tonight. I feel sympathy for her son, family and friends, awed at the way she devoted herself to her disabled husband, and now so sad for her lost life. Hope I haven't increased anyone's burden tonight. I just needed someplace safe to say what I've been thinking and feeling.",

I was worried about the tylenol and liver effect, but she reassured me it would only be for a few days and I would be okay. They will check my liver tests carefully to be sure. But, I made the mistake of taking a dose on an empty stomach and paid for that with vomiting off and on today. Dumb, dumb. I knew better, but pain has a way of fogging my brain. Anyway, hope this only continues a short time. I am beat and just want a few hours of peaceful sleep. Take care and hope all is well for you,",

My pattern seems to be that I have a week of side effects and misery, followed by a week of feeling better, up to the next treatment day. I'm having chemo every other Thursday. So, today seems to be the beginning of my \"feeling better\" week. Not that I ever really get back to my \"normal\" self - whatever that was. But, it sure beats the week following treatment. Yesterday I just wanted to lay down and cry because the prospect of two more cycles of treatment seemed too much to handle - and I felt so-o-o tired, worn out, and miserable. Today, everything seems much brighter. It's probably the effects of 7 hours uninterrupted sleep (a miracle!) and a nice Chinese food meal with my husband (he often works late and I have dinner alone). Those two things alone would probably make anyone feel better. It certainly made a difference for me. Anyway, hope you all have a good day and if you are feeling some misery today my heart goes out to you and I wish you a speedy improvement!",

She had another friend who had walked the BC road several years ago.  He was a quiet and charitable soul.  I remember him in the adult Sunday School class as someone who seemed to know so much about the scriptures and doctrine.  My husband remembered how generous he was with his time in service to others. Needless to say, church today was very somber.  Alot of the teenagers took the news of the young man pretty hard.  There were many hugs and tears.  It's good they have had strong friendships, even though to lose a friend is a hard thing to go through.  The son of one of my best friends was very close to the boy who died.  They accomplished their Eagle Scout awards together and had plans for their lives as friends.  She was pretty sad because her son is grieving so much. It is true that sorrow visits us all in life at some time or another.  I believe faith and prayer can get you through and I told the girls in my youth class today that I know they will find comfort and peace this way.  I hope they won't have to find out this lesson for themselves too soon in life.  Now, in a couple of hours we are going to the wedding of other friend's son.  He has served 3 tours of duty in Iraq and now is home safely to marry his sweetheart.  She is also in the military, but did not go to Iraq.  So, there is happiness in life also.  This young man's older brother was killed in freak accident earlier this summer and the mom (our friend) has been fighting stomach cancer for 2 years now.  She was diagnosed 2 months before I was diagnosed.  Her chemo was about a month ahead of me and we used to trade stories.  She had a much more difficult time than me.  So, this family is due for alot of happiness today.  Finally, I'll get to meet the grandkids our friends talk about whenever we see them. It's being held in a place called Belhurst Castle on the shore of Seneca Lake in Geneva, NY.  Here's a link www.belhurstcastle.com/wedding...   if you would like to see the place.  It's fancy-schmancy . . . and we are looking forward to seeing this grand nineteenth century hotel up close.  It has a fantastic reputation so I think we may just have fun.  Also, since we never did go out for our anniversary we think this is a nice way to celebrate by attending a fancy wedding.  I'll be wearing a nice dress but wish I would have purchased something really sparkly for the event.  Oh well, I'll just let my smile be my umbrella, as the saying goes. Hope everyone has had a nice weekend,",

I think that is a terrible thing.  So, being more open and activist in this respect is a good thing.  But, I do agree . . . . the pink ribbon industry is a bit too much.  I often wonder if the money rerally does reach the research scientists who need it.  There are some agencies you can trust and some you cannot. I also understand the reluctance about using another service for our communications.  My primary motive, as I stated before, was being uncomfortable with arbitrary monitoring of our conversations here at this site.  So, I am glad that we will have someplace to talk freely and even disagree, politely and kindly, without babysitters.  If I need to log into 3 places each day it will take more time, but I am commited to all of you and so I'll do it. Please, lets start a rally to LET MARK OUT OF THE CRATE.  He is too cute to be locked up.  Surely he did nothing that terrible!!!  LOL love you all, Mary",

I keep comparing my experiences to yours to see if I am \"normal\". So, as you move out through the \"no treatment\" phase and pop your Tamoxifen, I still want to know what is happening. The decision on whether I will take Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors is not made yet. Will depend results of blood tests to be done in 4 weeks, before my next oncology appointment. My doctor told me yesterday that she would be comfortable with starting on Tamoxifen until the blood tests show I have definitely gone into menopause, and then switch over to the aromatase inhibitors. I have had endometrial hyperplasia for several years so Tamoxifen carries a bit more risk for me, but with close monitoring, we should be able to catch any adverse effects. I'll be interested to know how it affects you.",

I had a long talk last night with a friend (male) about the almost certain conclusion that chemo finally pushed me into menopause. I had a endometrial biopsy last week and the gyn told me the biopsy shows not sign of hyperplasia or malignancy and has the appearance of cells that are not being affected by hormones. In other words, no monthly cycles. She thinks chemo just shut down any activity of the ovaries and that it probably will not begin again, given my age (53). My good friend asked, \"How does that make you feel?\" It's mixed. I know you'll all understand. There's a certain amount of fuss & bother that won't occur, but the loss of estrogen and the other hormones brings other \"yet-to-be-understood\" experiences. Mostly, I see this as one of my developmental milestones. I don't think I can have any claim on youth - probably haven't been able to do that for a long time - but now it is certain. The beginning of menstrual cycles 40 years ago marked me a woman, now am I less a woman? I think not, but it is something to contemplate. What makes us women? Not just having periods. Having breast cancer? Not that either. I am pondering it all. Trying to understand my feelings and reactions. I do agree, after this winter's arduous journey I also feel enriched and somewhat wiser than I was before. Wisdom that has a high price, but worth having.",

Got some sad news yesterday.  A young man from my church family started college last week in Provo, Utah and Thursday night was found dead in his dorm room.  The person who informed me did not know the reason why.  He was the youngest son of a much respected member of our congregation.  This young man's mother died some years ago and the father had raised him alone.  The woman was this father's second wife.  He had buried his first wife after having a family of 6 kids with her.  Those kids were all older and pretty much out of the house before this man married the second wife and had this younger son with her.  So, now this gentleman has lost both his wives and his youngest son.  It is really sad.  I taught this young fellow in a Sunday School class a few years ago and he was very bright and musically talented.  So once again, we're having a funeral in our church for a young person who has died much too soon. Tomorrow, they are having a special meeting for the youth of the church because, of course, many of them knew him well.  But, the younger girls in the class that I teach probably did not know him as well, being 5 or 6 years younger, so I will be teaching my usual class.  The topic is about communicating with God through prayer.  A timely topic, as it turns out. It's great to read one of your thoughtful messages, Michele. I'm always impressed with how you care about each of us. best wishes and prayers for all of you,",

Thanks for just letting me get that out.  I'll be okay. bye now, Mary",

I'm assuming if we all have a g-mail account and we only give the e-mail address to each other, that's the way we will be able to keep privacy.  However, if we give our g-mail addresses out publicly, then we potentially can get e-mail from anyone who has the address or looks it up.  That's why I will send you my address privately. I plan to use my g-mail address only for Rocktober girls communications.  My pre-existing e-mail at Hotmail can carry the traffic for my family, other friends, church, and knitting . . . along with all the blankity-blank spam! If I have the wrong idea about how this will work, please st me straight.",

I've always had a great love of history.  I especially love stories of valor and courage in times of adversity whether they involved pioneers going west, soldiers in war, politicians taking a moral stand, or great achievers surmounting odds.  That's what I like in sports, also.  Those people, and some of my own ancestors who were ninteenth century pioneers going west to Utah, have inspired me with that same quality.  They had troubles, but the kept putting one foot in front of the other, and did what had to be done.  About ten years ago the 150 anniversary of the pioneers arrival in Utah was celebrated.  One of the themes of that annniversary was that the pioneers walked across the plains and the mountains with \"faith in every footstep.\"  At the time, I got a keyring with the logo and those words on it.  I carry it everyday and when I was in treatment, I looked at it often, thinking that in my way, I was now walking with \"faith in every footstep.\"  Sometimes they were faltering, weak, and I needed help, but I kept on walking.  As did we all!!",

      "Content": "Sep 17, 2007 09:27AM marymelodi wrote: Hi, everyone: Hope all is well for each of you today. I had a semi-good weekend, but got ill at the end with tummy trouble and a headache. I stayed at home today to get feeling better. I wanted to answer TracyNY's question about another forum. As I recall, there was some concern a while back that Rocktober sisters did not feel comfortable opening their private experiences, feelings, and thoughts in a very public forum. BC.org is totally public. Anyone can sign up and read anything and comment and pretend to be someone you think you know. There is no way to shield your messges or direct them just to your trusted friends, other than individual private messages. Also, there was discontent for some because of the monitoring, deleting, and censorship of messages on the BC forum. If someone complains about you, your message can be deleted and you can be blocked by the moderators. I was one who found this pretty upsetting. So, a couple of us began to explore ways to communicate as Rocktober sisters more privately. That is the purpose of the Yahoo October Women group. Only Rocktober sisters can join, read messages, and post messages. When you are looking at messages you can have them grouped by topics so if you want to participate in a conversation about a particular topic, you can follow that one. Or, like I do, you can read everything and respond where you wish. You can choose to receive an e-mail of every message, or a daily digest of the messages for the day, or receiving no e-mails and just go to the group site to read what's being said whenever you want. We had difficulty at the beginning, primarily because I leaped before I looked, and failed to read the instructions before starting off. So, for a few days, every message that was posted had to be approved by me (only because I started the group). So, when I did \"read the instructions\" I fixed the problem (a simple click of the keys) and now messages can be posted at will. NO moderating, monitoring, censoring, deleting or blocking of a Rocktober sister. I'm terribly concerned that the existence of another place to communicate will split the group in some way. That is a great fear I have. Many of us seem ready to move beyond BC talk as the basis of our friendship. To me, this is not a rejection of anyone or especially, anyone still dealing with the aftermath. But I see, as many do, that we spend less time talking about BC and more about our day-to-day lives. I suppose we could agree to use the October Women group as our \"private spot\" while continuing activity here at BC.org. However, for myself, I have trouble enough participating in one location. I would ultimately, I think, carry on in one place or the other. Originally, I proposed that we try Yahoo for a couple of weeks and then assess how we feel. However, Rosemarie's comment, \"I don't know where to post\" brings up an important point. If we don't use the October Women group, how can we know if we like it or not? As we have become better friends I find great pleasure in your company, limited as it is by distance. I would not mind the group e-mails that flourished just before we went to Chicago. But, they fill up an in-box very quickly. And you have to deal with everyone, one way or another by reading, saving to a file, or deleting. Also, there are some of us who prefer to keep their e-mail private and participate through a site, such as BC.org or October Women. Let us continue talking about what works, what we want, and how we can best continue this precious network of friendship that we have built. Love to you all~",
