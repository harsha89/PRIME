I was not sure if I am a Winter person since my rads start next month, but decided to post anyway :) I go Monday for my set-up. Holding my arms over my head for 2 hours does not sound like fun, at least the actual treatment should be quicker. My RO was great in explaining everything. She actually pointed out the areas that are likely to burn after the first 2 weeks. I will have 28. She said not to buy any creams, they will give as needed. And they will tell me what over the counter stuff to buy if those don't work. She did say to get cornstarch and aloe vera gel.

I have my port placed this Wednesday. My pre-chemo session with the nurse was very helpful, but I was overwhelmed with all of the meds I will need to take pre-infusion. The nurse also suggested tree tea oil for my nails, will look on amazon to see if there is a nail polish type. I will also be getting Neulasta injection the day after infusion, I see there is a variety of reactions from the ladies so hoping my bone pain won't be bad. I am supposed to take Claritin for 5 days after. My plan is to work during treatment, really concerned that I will be able to function and think during chemo. My infusions are on Thursday, not sure when the worst days are after chemo but will have the weekend to recover. For now just making sure I have my laundry list of prescriptions filled and hoping the port procedure goes well. Cherice ",
