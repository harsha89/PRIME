      "Content": "May 31, 2018 03:29PM - edited Jun 1, 2018 04:38PM by r2d2chelsea I am scheduled for a Preventative Bilateral Mastectomy and ovary removal on July 19th! My last mamagram (two months ago) showed a lot of breast changes. My oncologist and B.S. are wonderful. They are both being cautious and acting fast.They are doing both surgeries on the same day while I am under. My mom was diagnosed with aggressive 0varian Cancer at 35 and had DCIS before 50. My grandmother and great grandmother died of breast cancer. I'm working hard to get physically and emotionally ready for surgery! I am so thankful for this site. It has helped my husband and I process and absorb all the information that is coming at us fast. I'm learning so much! Let's Do This!!! :)",
