But it is always a good idea to get it checked out for peace of mind. For those who can\u2019t be as active during these trying times, it\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. Everyone is different. Our bodies do things differently. You should be fine with whatever you are able to do. Even if it\u2019s a 10 minute walk, hey you did something and that is a huge accomplishment! This is your time to heal, not push yourself too much to exhaustion I see number one concern for most woman is losing hair. Mine too. I guess we just have to accept this as another unfortunate side effect of this terrible disease. My fear also is that if people see me bald, they will see me as sickly and feel bad for me. I don\u2019t want that. Lookup09- welcome! My biggest suggestion to you will be to make sure you do everything you can to combat the possible side effects. This can also mean taking medications a few days before chemo, eating or not eating a certain foods the week of chemo and on chemo day that will bother you later. Make a daily medicine chart. There\u2019s a lot of great advice on here about controlling SE\u2019s or talk to your MO or infusion nurse in detail about it all",

However, after seeing how much fall out I had after just the first chemo, I decided to order a prosthetic wig. I just couldn\u2019t deal with the stress of trying to get better and having to deal with hair loss. I didn\u2019t want the uncertainty of not knowing how well the cold cap will or will not work. After my second chemo A LOT more hair fell out. I am lucky, people can\u2019t tell how thin my hair has gotten and I\u2019m able to cover up the little bald spot I have on top, but I\u2019m glad I opted to get the wig and notworry about cold capping. My third infusion is next Friday and I won\u2019t have my wig till mid October so I\u2019ll still have to cold cap for that infusion. I just hope I don\u2019t lose too much More hair before the wig arrives. I honestly would\u2019ve loved to still have all my own natural hair at the end of all the chemos, but managing hair and chemo side effects at the same time is too stressful",

But I hadn\u2019t educated myself on how to minimize SE\u2019s. The third time around my husband and I did a lot of research on what to do and take even before chemo day and the 3rd time around was different. The worst thing I feel so far third time around (I\u2019m day 10 after the third chemo), is my mouth became EXTREMELY dry this time, not even biotene was working. My husband can see white dryness on the roof of my mouth. And the taste in my mouth this time around was way worse, also. Due to all this, my gag reflex was heightened and I puked twice on Saturday. I also haven\u2019t been been able to eat or drink properly since Friday. Buthopefully today all this is subsiding. I also can\u2019t sleep night. I sleep more in the daytime. But all in all, keep up with all the possible side effects medications even if you don\u2019t have the SE\u2019s and that should help. I\u2019m thinking that because I took so much medication, that may have caused the bad dry mouth.",
