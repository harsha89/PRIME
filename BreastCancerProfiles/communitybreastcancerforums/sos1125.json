My issue is I'm not really having incision problems and don't want to fly from Michigan to Boston just for an incision check (I figure I could go to my PCP just to ensure nothing looks infected if a check is truly needed). The surgeon's office has set up appointments with not only surgeon but medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. I can't figure why the heck I am seeing them if the pathology report isn't ready yet. I figure the radiation oncologist wouldn't necessarily care about the hormone receptor status information, but would need the rest of the report to actually plan anything. I just don't want to make a very expensive and time-consuming trip to get very little new information. Thanks again for the input. I have a call in to the lab to see whether they will at least release a partial report by Friday. I would really rather reschedule while I still may be able to salvage part of the cost of plane tickets. So frustrating.

Just asked the surgeon's assistant whether my final pathology report will be available by Friday and was told the lab shows pathology testing is \"in process\" but there will likely be some results. Called the pathology lab and was told results likely would be ready, however, if \"stains\" are needed, that could hold up the report. Belatedly occurred to me to ask about the stains as I'm pretty sure they would be required to retest estrogen- and progesterone-receptor status and her2/neu, and also forgot to ask whether lab would release a partial report to provide whatever information is available by 12/18. I'm going through all this because I travel to a different state for care and really want appointments to be productive. My surgical incisions appear to be healing fine, so I think a couple days of delay on surgical follow-up would be okay in the interests of proceeding with needed pathology information in hand. So my question is: can anybody tell me whether the typical lumpectomy pathology report does include \"stains\" and whether a pathology lab will release a partial report ahead of the \"final\" report if the stained tissue takes forever to process? Thanks for any info. you can pass along, I really don't want to travel for hours only to find can't do much because information is unavailable.

For those of us in the \"intermediate\" range of the Oncotype DX test, the decision about chemo becomes quite complicated as medical oncologists may \"strongly encourage\" chemo and yet at the same time they cannot advise what the benefit will be; meanwhile, chemo is basically poison and there are significant long-term risks to consider. I am at the top of the \"intermediate\" range and have had three opinions re benefit: 2-3%, 2-4%, and \"there is no way to calculate benefit accurately, you are in a 'gray area.'\" All three oncologists said there is no real data to assess what chemo benefit will be, they are making the best educated guess they can make. The online calculators don't factor in Oncotype DX score, so it's hard to figure how much you can rely on those stats, which give me a much lower recurrence risk. As you indicated, response to chemo and SEs are very much a crapshoot for anyone, so risk vs. benefit is anything but clear, but it's important to think about risk vs. benefit. I'm not talking about \"inconvenience,\" more about potential serious long-term effects. Since my tumor size is fairly small, I'm guessing I'm at or near the bottom of the 15-24% recurrence risk Oncotype DX shows on the first page of my report. Who wouldn't like any percentage decrease in recurrence risk, but I want to make an informed choice about my treatment and all of its implications and not just go into chemo in a blind panic and unaware of the risks. Some kind soul on this board suggested that I inquire whether CMF would be an option in my case (rather than TC), and oncologist said that could work. Have just begun my research, but so far, CMF seems close in effectiveness and the potential side effects seem less severe. I really appreciate all of the information offered on this board. I know some folks can just take their oncologist's advice right off the bat and be comfortable with that. I have to do my own analysis and look at treatment in a more holistic way. In my experience, cancer docs are laser-focused on cancer and less so on the whole person and the broader implications of treatment choices.",

      "Content": "Jan 20, 2016 08:54PM sos1125 wrote: Hi, JuniperCat, I ultimately decided to skip chemo. Had a pretty confusing situation with my score of 30: first oncologist used a \"physician calculator\" on the Oncotype DX website and told me my benefit from chemo would be 2-3%; second onc said chemo benefit would be 2-4%; third onc said couldn't calculate benefit, but strongly encouraged chemo. I researched the recommended TC protocol and decided the likely side effects were too severe and I would not do that for a small benefit... But was still afraid about the score of 30. So asked about an older CMF protocol that was slightly less effective (so I figured maybe a 1-3% benefit), but had slightly less severe side effects and was told by all three oncologists that this was possible. But when I stepped back from the fear for a minute, on a gut level I had a problem with using this one test conducted by just this one company that promotes the crap out of their product to the point where you basically cannot find any information on the web that didn't originate from one of their press releases as the sole basis for making a decision to do something as potentially life-altering as chemotherapy. I did do a lot of searching for more information about the test and the basis of the assumptions it uses. Eventually I realized/learned the following about the Oncotype DX test: 1. The patient cohorts they used to come up with the recurrence score charts include people with stages I and II cancer, grades 1-3, and with tumor sizes up to 5cm. So within the category that matches some biological markers of your tumor, there is a wide variation in degree of disease. 2. Physicians have access to a \"Recurrence Score-Pathology-Clinical Calculator\" in which they can input patient age, tumor size, tumor grade, type of hormone therapy (tamoxifen or AI, they assume ER+ and node-negative). That's where my oncologists got the 2-3% or 2-4% benefit, because my recurrence risk on tamoxifen is estimated at 11% and on AI at 9%, and chemo is supposed to reduce recurrence risk by around 1/3. Genomic health states that the recurrence score obtained using the calculator is more accurate for the individual patient than using the recurrence score alone or pathology findings alone, however, they also state that the calculator has not been validated according to industry \"Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\" standards. You can read more about the physician calculators and access the user guide here: https://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Profess... I was curious what my 11% recurrence risk on tamoxifen alone would translate into as a recurrence score, and eventually found out that this would put me at a score of 17, or at the top of the \"low risk of recurrence\" category. Reviewed all of this information with my PCP just to get a reality check, and she agreed that my recurrence risk really isn't as high as the score of 30 implies and it would make no sense to hazard chemo for such a small benefit. So after two excruciating weeks, finally had my answer. Phew. On to radiation therapy, dreading that, but it does appear to offer a clear and significant benefit for the risk involved. BTW, while reading Susan Love's \"Breast Book\" as part of my research on minimizing recurrence risk, found out that a program of pretty moderate/doable regular exercise can reduce recurrence risk by 6% (or more according to some estimates), so I am swapping out exercise for chemo, and very happy to do that. ;o)",

Scares the bejeebers out of me. Also, did TC mess up your eyesight? I am pretty nearsighted, wondering what kind of damage occurs. I've only read that sometimes people develop a twitch or get runny eyes, hopefully that all resolves after treatment. Thanks for any insights.

Glad you feel any \"chemo brain\" is resolving in your case and that there won't be permanent effects. Was very freaked out at the oncologist's \"5% have debilitating problems\" statistic, but it does occur to me that those folks may have other health issues that exacerbated the brain effects of chemo. I've thought the same thing re \"what if I can't tolerate the hormone therapy drugs\" (which also scare me and I figure those likely harm the brain, too, since they starve cells of estrogen). If I had chemo and radiation done, then at least I would have pared the recurrence risk down some. I really wish there were more studies to prove effectiveness of non-toxic prevention. But with a life-threatening disease it's pretty hard to disregard the medical community's \"standard of care.\" Thanks for sharing your experience and for the support, I appreciate it.",
