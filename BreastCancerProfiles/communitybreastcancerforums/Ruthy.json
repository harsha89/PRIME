I wish I had known of it when I was dx 6 yrs ago. I noticed some of you were and were not taking tamoxifan. I had terrible hot flashes, felt depressed, and just did not feel like myself. After a lot of reading including Dr. Lee's and Suzanne Summer's books, I got up the courage to throw out the tamoxifan. I was scared to death, but I began using many supplements and also started using bioidentical progesterone. My hot flashes went away, I began sleeping through the night again (which I had not done since my treatment). I really prayed about my decision also. I would never go back to taking the tamoxifen. In fact I believe ther is a lot of harm being done to people by the pharmaceutical companies. In fact, I am convinced that my 10 years of birth control pills led to my cancer. They contain the same synthetic hormones found in HRT. I am now 49 and continue to work in a busy ER. I am grateful to have my health and try to do everything I can to keep it. I had no concept of how horrible it was to be dx with cancer until it happened to me. Sorry this is so long, it's just not often I find people who have this ordeal in common with me and it is wonderful just to vent. Anyway, check out those books I read and for your own opinion about the bioidentical hormones. For myself, I want good quality of life. See ya'll online, Ruthy",
