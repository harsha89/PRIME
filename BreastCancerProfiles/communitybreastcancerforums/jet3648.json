Mon.  She says yes to Chemo   6 cycles of Cytoxan and Taxotere  she has a criteria of  3 points for Chemo and I hit on 2 of the 3.  I have asked for Oncotyping DX  so we are waiting for that but I doubt thatshe will change her mind even if I get a low number.  So I am expecting to do Chemo,  I see her next on the 26th.  I will need a port so expect it will be Aug before Im ready to start. Did not ask as many questions as I might have as I was stunned by her statement.  Have lots now so will wait till I see her.    After Chemo I will have 6 weeks of radiation. It will be great to have friends to walk along this journey together. Jet.",

I will know for sure on Monday about my schedule and will let you know for the list. Thanks for all the info and tips about dealing with side effects.  Dont know how much help/info I will get from the nurses at my hospital. ",

I have not decided about the hair situation yet.  I have had thinning hair from psoriasis for several years and have worn a hairpiece for some time so I probably will just deal until I get tired of dealing.   I will just see what happens as I go along.  Jetta ",

SOOOOOOOOO!!! See onco tomorrow  and   will see if her plan of T/C 6X changes now.    I will let you know what I find out. Jet",

I guess Im getting kicked off this thread.  I do not have to have Chemo.   Only Arimidex for 5 years, and rads for 6 weeks.   This is a great website. I learned so much and knew what questions to ask.   It also helped me understand other websites that I read that were not so easy to understand. I will check back to see how you ladies are doing.    Good luck to all and stay strong. (((((hugs))))) and prayers to all. Jet",
