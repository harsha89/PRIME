You can have your slides sent to him for review. I was dx with ALH, and chose not to have surgery. If you are dx post menopause your risk may bit lower, there is something called Minimal ALH, jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/f... www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/con... BUT Look at all you risk factors Dense Breasts? When you had your children? Breast cancer in the family? Genetic testing results? Post Menopause Hormone use?  Radation Exposure at a young age to your chest? Overweight? Alcohol use? High Fat Diet? No Physical activity? Smoking? Nightwork? www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/con...
