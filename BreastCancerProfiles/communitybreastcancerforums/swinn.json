When I was in the hospital for something other than bc the hospital doc said \"so you're taking ativan, then you're addicted\". I didn't appreciate her comment. I wanted to say \"you try getting through bc then diverticulitis and tell me if you don't need something to help you\"?Â  Some docs can make me so mad. Just glad my pcp doesn't feel that way. Unfortunately he wasn't the hospital doc I had to deal with when being hospitalized. Sally",
