I chose free tram flap reconstruction because I was a little nervyabout implants. My \u201cfoobs\u201d are hard and look weird. I was a full double D my whole life and I think I\u2019m a B now. I\u2019m frustrated that I\u2019m so sore I\u2019m frustrated that my boobs look ugly I\u2019m frustrated and I want my body back I still can\u2019t drive. I\u2019m a nurse and I\u2019m praying I can go back to work in 3 more weeks (6 weeks off). Anyone out there go through this kind of surgery? Does this weird under arm swelling go away? Will my foobs ever feel like normal soft boobs again???

They increased my dose to 600mh every 8 hours and it has helped. I guess I\u2019m at that three week annoyed phase you mentioned. I want this last of my six drains OUT! I just want to start feeling better. I\u2019m poor because I\u2019m on leave from work as a nurse and I still haven\u2019t gotten a disability check so I can\u2019t pay bills.
