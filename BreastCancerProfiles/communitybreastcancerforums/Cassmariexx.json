I go the 30th of this mon to have a guided ultrasound and they're using a vacuum needle and I am so scared. I am terrified of needles and blood work and my nurse thinks it's funny. She refused to give me anything for anxiety and now I'm thinking about canceling last minute because I don't trust my hospital and I'm not comfortable at all with my nurse or surgeon. I don't know what to do and I'm making myself sick. Log in to post a reply",

As for the volume I am going to take one but I'm afraid of how that will make me feel because my anxiety is so bad. As for the nurse I am going to say something to my primary Doctor about her, she isn't my main nurse she's just from radiology. If she says anything like that to me tomorrow I'm definitely going to tell her that I don't like how she's talking to me. I definitely didn't deserve to be treated like that, adult or not I can't help it if I'm anxious of needles or afraid.",
