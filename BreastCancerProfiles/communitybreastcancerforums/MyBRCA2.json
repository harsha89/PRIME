I called the surgeon and they just said to go to my doctor to discuss birth control pill or HRT (which I am already taking). So they gave me a note for 2 weeks off too originally but I don't know how I will be able to work with this bleeding. It's constant and I am not allowed to wear a tampon!! ",
