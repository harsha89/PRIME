He said there might also be experimental treatments eventually, but wants to go with what he knows to work and hopefully we can delay my hair all falling out again. I know that's the least of the worries but it was just starting to grow several inches and my daughters have been so excited to see it grow back! Maybe at my second opinion appointment they might have some information for more treatments too. What are others thoughts on birth control? My onc and my gynecologist both said that having the mirena iud is ok since the cancer isn't hormone positive.",

This is my first post, I just received the news yesterday that I have a reoccurrence & there is now cancer in my lumbar bones & a lymph node on the left side by my clavicle, original cancer was on the right. I was only NED for 4 months after having chemo, mastectomy, radiation & 2 rounds of preventative xeloda. My oncologist wants to do a biopsy this week to check if the bone mets have changed to her2 positive. If not then I will have my port put back & start an iv chemo for 3 weeks on, 1 off, indefinitely. I don't remember the name of the chemo, but does anyone know if that is pretty standard for bone mets? I'm getting a second opinion at an NCI accredited clinic next week too, but it's 3 hours from home. Very emotional for my family this week & pretty devastated. I thought bone mets were more treatable & had a longer prognosis but the dr seemed to indicate that it only has a prognosis of 2-3 years. That we would go to one drug then when it stops working, go to the next. Does the chemo always stop working? It's just so hard to comprehend right now.",
