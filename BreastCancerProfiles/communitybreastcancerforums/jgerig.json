That doctor told me that he believed the adenomas would disappear completely within a year. I had several follow ups and he seemed pleased with the progress. A year and a half ago we moved across the county and I left that doctor behind. For the last year and a half I haven't seen a breast doctor. My husband and I have decided to try for one more baby so I thought it was time to find a doctor to follow my fibrocystic breasts. During her initial ultrasound she located 3 fibroadenomas in my left breast and 1 in my right. 2 of the ademonas in my left look like classic fibroadenomas but one of them looks \"slightly irregular\". It is VERY close to the same place my original ablated adenoma was but there is no way to know for sure if it is the same because my previous doctor did not put a marker in. The new doctor says that it does not look like cancer and probably look \"slightly irregular\" because it has been previously ablased. She was comfortable with a wait and see 6 month follow up but said that if I wanted to be sure, she would biopsy it. I opted to have it biopsied. This happened today. Doctor said I will probably have results by Friday afternoon. I am scared out of my mind about the results. My previous doctor told me that the cyroablation would remove it completely but this doctor is saying that she used to offer ablation but quit because it wasn't making them go away 100% and she really believes that this is what that is. She even looked at the tissue samples and said that based upon what they looked like she believed that it was another fibroadenoma.... How would she know that????? I'm freaking out. I'm 31 and I have 3 young children Log in to post a reply",
