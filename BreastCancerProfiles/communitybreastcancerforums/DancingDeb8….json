I'll loose it if they find something.  I can't do this ever again. ",

Tomorrow I have simulation and start Monday for 35 Treatments.  5 weeks of the entire breast and 2 weeks target area.  I'm really scared to begin.  Everyone says it's not as bad a chemo and maybe I'll just be tired.   Can you clarify and be truthful.   Don't know what to expect ",
