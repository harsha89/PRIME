The worse symptoms have been hot flashes, insomnia and the dryness.  The Aromasin has definitely made the dryness worse, but the other issues could be getting worse all on their own, or maybe are related.  Who knows? (I've about decided the hot flashes are worse. . . I'm sweating more with them too. Fun!) I've been using Vagifem which some doctors don't want their high risk patients to use.  My oncologist said it is a minimal amount of estradiol and he appreciated the quality of life issue that it represents.  It isn't enough, though, so I've been using Luvena which you can get at any drug store.  It comes in prefilled applicators.  That is all I've been doing, but it isn't enough anymore, so I'm going to hunt down something else. I've used Replens before too. I'm taking 1000 mg Calcium, and that supplement has 600 IU Vitamin D3 included.  I take another supplement of 1000 IU D3. I haven't even talked about supplements with my doctor, so I guess if I need to do something else I'll find out! That's great that your pain has been better for a couple of days. . . maybe it is a new trend! Are the mood swings very bad? Hang in there!",

You mentioned that your husband is worried, but no one else is supportive. When I got word of my call back, several people told me that they had been through it too, and that nothing was ever wrong. Others would say, \"You'll be fine! No big deal!\" It seemed to me that no one would acknowledge my worry, even though I knew the result could be a good one. I don't know about you, but it is more helpful for people to acknowledge the fear, than to act like nothing could possibly go wrong , which implies it is an overreaction to worry. I ended up needing a biopsy, had one failed procedure, ended up having a surgical biopsy then finally got the pathology report that there was no cancer, but I do have atypical hyperplasia (ductal and lobular). I'm about to go on Tamoxifen or an A.I. So while the report was good, it wasn't totally good and I'm facing 5 years of a drug that has unpleasant (and possibly worse) side effects. I hope the best for you, and I also hope some of the people in your life will be supportive and will let you vent your worries, and not try to sugar coat them and pretend it is certain that all will be well. Sometimes people mean to cheer us up, but it feels like they are denying the reality of what we are facing. I do hope you get a good result! I'll be checking back to see how you are. Please update us!",

So for some of them it's hard to tell if they would be increasing in intensity anyway, or if Aromasin is making them worse. I am having aches in my wrists and hands, but am waiting to see if it is an unrelated temporary event or a side effect. I've heard that some don't develop SEs until they are a month or so into the process. Of course, you, Jld03, are almost 2 months in. Are you having the same effects now that you had right away? I have noticed more severe vaginal dryness, which I am already working on with various treatments, but I think I need to find something else, too. That was true even while in HRT, then got worse when I quit, and now even worse. So I guess I'll take it a day at a time and see what else happens! How are you dealing with your SEs? Are you able to still do everything you need to do? Good luck with your decision, MelissaDallas!",

Momcat, I've got a few years on you.  I was 50 in 2005 when I had ovaries removed.  I had horribly painful cysts in my right ovary all the time (and for years) so the dr decided to remove it, but wanted to take the left one too to avoid ovarian cancer.  I wasn't thrilled about that, because I didn't really want to go into instant menopause, but that is what we did.  I had horrible hot flashes and went on HRT right away.  It was wonderful.  Two years ago I went off HRT with the intent of going on Evista at my doctor's recommendation, but had such horrible hot flashes still that I begged to be allower to go back on HRT.  He had said that Evista causes hot flashes and I couldn't imagine going through that.  I also had no family history of breast cancer, and didn't really understand other risk factors.  So I got back on HRT until the day my mammogram showed trouble (June 13), and he told me I had used my last HRT patch.  Now I'm back into the horrible hot flashes!  And I'm facing taking either Tamoxifen or an AI both of which can cause horrible hot flashes (among many other side effects). I wonder now what would have happened if I had stayed off HRT two years ago and had gone on Evista.  I wonder if I would have avoided the ADH/ALH and wouldn't be facing needing the stronger meds.  Oh well!  I'll never know.  Let me know what your surgeon says about a consult with oncology. ",
