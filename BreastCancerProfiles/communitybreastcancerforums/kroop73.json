Fightingirl and Pyrrh I did find out the name of my brachytherapy is \"Mammosite\" which is the balloon therapy. I should be able to give a better description after tomorrows placement. Fightingirl, I will be taking tamoxifen for 5 years I think. :-)",

I had my balloon catheter implanted today. My type of catheter is called a mammo site. They made an incision, inserted the balloon and inflated it. I was put to sleep for the procedure. My BS said she left it open to drain. She gave me Levaquin to take for the duration of the rads. She also prescribed more pain meds. I have a surgical bra that zips and hooks in the front. I have one tube protruding from the incision with about 5 lead wires and 2 tubes (sorta like IV tubing) inside that tube. I go to the onco radiologist on thursday to have the placement checked and who knows what else. I will wear this bra for 10 days. I start the rads next week, Mon-Fri 20-24th. Now the interesting part begins..... how to sleep and sponge bathe. I will admit its tight, uncomfortable, itchy, and I'm in some pain. Thanks ladies for the encouragement. I will do my best to share my experience everyday. I encourage all of you as well to keep fighting the good fight! We will conquer! God Bless you all! ",

They were able to use the exact same incision from the lumpectomy in Dec to remove the tissue from my breast. But the lymph node removal required a second incision, which is under my left arm pit. I am very sore with both but I believe the arm pit is just a little more sore than the breast. I wish you the best with your surgery. It is not that bad at all. I was only down about a week. I don't work a full time job so I was able to take it easy and go at my own pace. Sleeping was the hardest thing... trying to get comfortable. But again, it was only about a week or so of discomfort. You will do fine.... I will be praying for you! Let me know if you have other questions. We will get through it together! God Bless! Kandi  ",

It wasn't and they didn't get a clear margin. So this past Friday, I had more breast tissue removed to obtain a clear margin and one lymph node removed. It appears from initial pathology done in the operating room that the node is clear of cancer. However, they have sent the tissue and node off for further testing. I have two incisions, one in the exact same place the lump was removed (bottom of my left breast) and another incision under my left armpit. I am doing well, holding my own with some soreness and little pain. I should know my pathology results by Tuesday 2/14. My surgeon did tell me that my oncotype dx number is 16 which is low and good. If the lymph node has no cancer cells, I will get to skip chemo. We are planning on brachyradiation (aka balloon radiation). I might be ready to start that in the next week or two. I thank God for every little piece of good news! Thanks for sharing your stories ladies! Its nice to be here to encourage and simply be here for one another. God Bless!",
