My G.P. has assured me she'll have me seen as quickly as possible, two weeks at the very latest but right now two weeks seems like an eternity. The clinic I've been referred to has a fantastic reputation so hope they fit me in soon.  Thanks a million for the support Mimi, it's great to speak to people in the same boat, that in itself is grounding.",

Aw I'm so sorry you have to go through this when you should be off having the time of your life on honeymoon, that's just so unfair. Try to use the time to unwind, maybe a few spa treatments and rest and relaxation and down the line book a second honeymoon but fingers crossed you'll get the all clear before you go and you can have a double celebration xx",

I think I've been in a state of shock for the last few days and was moving around a lot but getting nothing done. In Ireland the protocol for assessment is straight across the board, the same for all breast clinics in the country and the exact same treatments,waiting times and personnel whether you go public or private and actually I've been researching and apparently you're better off going public so I'm going to take it that my case is less urgent than others and that must be a good sign. Thanks once again for the support x",

I'm 43 with no BC in my immediate family and here breast check is offered to over 50s. I did have a patch of skin that looked like a mole (but wasn't a mole, I was doing sunbeds at the time and this patch of scaley skin appeared beside the nipple) removed with a few rounds of cryotherapy in that area of my breast approx five years ago, I don't know if that's relevant. I'm fairly positive this lump was not there six weeks ago. I give myself breast exams regularly and have b-cup non dense breasts. This lump is so obvious, I can see clearly that my breasts are different shapes and the one with the lump is heavier, if I bend at the waist it hangs lower. I can feel the lump with my arm if I press my arm to the side, it's not painful but when I press it a certain way it's tender like the feeling of my breasts just before my period. I can't feel any lumps or bumps under my arm. I did have weight loss but went on low carb to lose weight and lost maybe a kg per week. No skin changes, nipple discharge or anything like that. I have noticed that if I lie a certain way in bed my right arm throbs a bit and gets tingly but iv suffered on,and off with carpal tunnel since my pregnancies so put it down to that. I will keep you guys informed and thanks again ",

She did a very thorough breast examination and measured the lump. It's 8cm x 3cm, rock hard and doesn't move. It feels ridgey to me I did a self examination about 6 weeks ago and don't think it was there then but iv lost about a half stone in that time so think maybe with less fat on the breast the lump is more pronounced. My doc has referred my for an urgent triple assessment with the symptomatic breast clinic but could take up to two weeks to get an appointment. Aaaargh I don't know how I'm going to keep calm, my mind is in turmoil. As soon as I felt the lump I got an intense feeling that something was wrong, my whole body shook for about two hours. I have calmed down somewhat but wow this is scary!! Any words of wisdom? Log in to post a reply",

I'm going to ring the clinic tomorrow to see if they can fit me in sooner. On a positive note they do the mammogram, us and biopsy all on the same day here. I just need to find a calm place because if I've learnt anything from reading about other people's experiences it's that it's all a big waiting game, I've never had the gift of patience though. Well done on pushing for an earlier assessment and I hope you won't have to wait too long for the results, did they give you a time frame for biopsy results, I think it's about 10 days here.",
