I first noticed it when I was playing with my daughter it oozed out and was yellow I requested an appointment with my doctor in TX. they brushed it off and said it was nothing to worry about. A few months later I had blood lots of blood coming out and it would not stop I then went to the ER they did and ultrasound but just said it was a cyst and nothing to worry about. I moved back to Utah in January of 13 and had lots of pain from my right breast I yet again went to a doctor but this time they did and ultra sound and same day biopsy I waited over a month for the results and found out it was just really fibrous. I went to my scheduled appt with a surgeon a couple days ago and he recommended a major ductal excision. Im really nervous Im not sure what to excpect exactly they say im too young to be going through this and Im not sure what its going to mean for future pregnancies can I not breast feed again out of that one? they are removing all the ducts and doing a wedge? But during the biopsy they radiologist couldnt even get the needle in because of how fibrous my breast is would they have to remove the fibrous tissue as well?? Im kinda freaking out I have my surgery on the 15th. Any Answers would be helpful. I am still having tons of pain sometimes it almost takes my breath away.Â  Log in to post a reply",
