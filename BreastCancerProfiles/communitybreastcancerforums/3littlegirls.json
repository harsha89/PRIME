Thought it sounded promising and wanted to share.  Hope everyone can turn their cancer voice down real low for the day after reading this. I know I could use the break. Cheers, Michelle  CALGARY, AB, --- August 2, 2011 - Oncolytics Biotech Inc. (\u201cOncolytics\u201d) (TSX:ONC, NASDAQ:ONCY) announced today that an international team of researchers has reported on a study in the online version of Molecular Therapy, a publication of The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, investigating the timing of chemotherapy delivery that optimizes the efficacy of systemic REOLYSIN®. The paper is entitled \u201cPrecise Scheduling of Chemotherapy Primes VEGF-producing Tumors for Successful Systemic Oncolytic Virotherapy,\u201d authored by Kottke et al. The report describes when best to administer taxanes with reovirus to optimize viral delivery to the tumor mass. The researchers demonstrated that this drug combination was superior to either treatment alone, and were able to reproducibly cure nearly half of the treated animals by employing this optimized schedule of paclitaxel/REOLYSIN.  \u201cThis research supports and further rationalizes the dose schedules currently employed in our ongoing clinical efforts in the phase II and phase III setting,\u201d said Dr. Matt Coffey, Chief Operating Officer of Oncolytics. \u201cThese data will allow us to refine our planned studies for additional tumor indications.\u201d About Oncolytics Biotech Inc. Oncolytics is a Calgary-based biotechnology company focused on the development of oncolytic viruses as potential cancer therapeutics. Oncolytics\u2019 clinical program includes a variety of human trials including a Phase III trial in head and neck cancers using REOLYSIN, its proprietary formulation of the human reovirus.

I know there could of been worse news but their was that tiny bit of hope for some shrinkage.   On a good note my Onc, (who never gives out any hopeful comments) said since I have been stable for this long on Tamoxifen, that I should have similar results with other hormonals, once I need to switch.  I figure that should keep me going long enough for those lab rats to find the cure.  I don't think I will be going back to Mexico for any follow ups but I am still glad I went.  It certainly gave me all my energy back.  Just a very expensive way of doing it.  And who knows maybe it has helped.   Anyone been on Tamoxifen for a really long time?   Just curious how long it can work for Stage IV.  I know it's 5 years for lower stages.    Michelle Dx 4/19/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 5/18 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I remember when I first started coming to the boards at BCO and feeling so bad for those a few years into their fight. Thinking at least I am not them. I still have my 2 years in front of me. Well in a blink of an eye, I am now one of those \"lucky\" women who has managed to survive the 2 year mark. And I didn't even remember it was the 19th until it had come and was well gone. :) Thanks to 3 kids, an old sick dog, a tired husband and the stomach flu.  My oldest made it to Provincials this year in gymnastics so we had to travel to Edmonton for the competition on Thursday. The day I decided it was my turn to get the stomach flu (now that the rest of the family had run it's course) My poor husband had to stay home get the kids to school, then go to work, come home early and pick the girls up from school. Drive my oldest to a town outside Calgary where she trains (another story) and then head to another town 20 mins away from the first one to get the dog's drugs (another story) and then pick oldest daughter up and bring her back so we could all pile in the car and drive another 4 hours (What a long drive with the stomach flu). Anyway made it to a dive of a hotel and crawled into bed while husband battled the girls to sleep. Up at 6 am to get ready for meet and so on. That crazy Thursday was my anniversary. I was too sick and distracted by that and packing. I hope I can forget all my anniversaries (hopefully I have loads to forget) because I am too busy living. Thanks for listening.

I took her camping in the mountains, rock climbing, shopping,museums and had a wonderful time.  She left today :( I have had a few of these visits, another couple of my besties come 2 years ago (while going through treatment) we hadn't been all together since 16.  They're Irish (Ones in Beirut and the other Kilkenny) and again we all lived in Lesotho.  Magical years for all of us (International high school with 47 different nationalities, such an amazing experience). Those friends I made back them all have a deep special place in my heart and I have been so touched that they have made the long treks to come see me.  It is sad that it's because I have cancer but so touching.  It is so hard to think I am dying but what a gift to be able to have those friends from my pass come to see me.  We always make plans to see each other again but who really knows if there will be a next time.  I have been feeling invincible hiking and climbing mountains lately.  I know the future is unsure but it has been 2 years and I have no symptoms.  I think, maybe I will be around for the cure.  But then I come on here and see how all you wonderful ladies are doing and I am devastated to see so many wonderful souls that have been struggling and have left us.  It is so hard to read these posts, I care for every one of you. It is a sad bond we share but one that is so strong.  The support and love on here cannot be matched.  I will be back but I am off to Vancouver and Oregon for the next 3 weeks.  I am looking forward to meeting you Kim!  Looking forward to a relaxing vacation with the family.  Once the 11 hours drive to Vancouver is over. I get to do that part on my own so hubby can save 4 days vacation for another time.  Sorry I am not as eloquent a writer as most of you ladies.  I was the kid cracking jokes and talking.  I should of payed more attention to grammer and all that noise. ;P I hope everyone can find some reprieve from this beast and enjoy your summer.  I intend to give cancer the finger every chance I can.    Michelle Dx 4/19/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 5/18 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I just found out last week her limp in her front leg is not a torn tendon but in fact cancer.  She has a large tumour on her shoulder.  I took her back to the vet and he basically said there is nothing he can do except amputate the whole leg and shoulder.  SHe is almost 13 and a large dog so that woud be out of the question. He said she is in pain and should be put down.  Yes she limps but she has never whimpered or shown signs of pain except the limp.  The vet gave us morphine and she seems happy. I guess I just have issues when I myself am doing everything I can to stay alive and then I just go off and put my dog down?  I don't want to be cruel and keep her hanging on if she really is in pain but I also don't just want to end her life.  I am so torn and sad.  I hate cancer!   Michelle Dx 4/19/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 5/18 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
