To All:  I keep reading that you all are having blood work done prior to your rads and MO visits.  What are they drawing?  I have not heard any mention of blood work from mine, and haven't had any levels drawn since my last chemo tx.  I think I will call my RO to see if they will draw before my first rad tx. Leesa:  I understand how you feel about being \"cut loose\".  I am not done yet, but already I can feel the distance from some members of my team.  When I was diagnosed, I was assigned a team of docs with their residents and fellows, and a nurse practitioner, and we met all of them a once.  It was overwhelming to say the least.  I was in constant contact with the docs, nurses, fellows and residents.  As they explained it, throughout the periods of my treatment they will \"fade into the background\" until I am ready to see them again.  It is a little unnerving.  Being at a large teaching institution, I end up seeing the fellows, nurse practitioners and chief residents more than the \"big\" docs.  I do have a plan to see my MO's team every 3 months, my surgeon's nurse practitioner every 6 months (for now) and I don't know about the RO.  I have a mammo scheduled for my healthy breast and a follow up MRI scheduled for my right breast which had the cancer.  I had a questionable area prior to surgery that was studied extensively and deemed healthy.  So this is another precaution.  I pray that it is still normal.  But, even though I have these things scheduled, I feel the communication is less frequent.  I met my RO back in October and haven't seen him since...just his chief resident who assures me that they are working together on my plan.  I know I have to shift from one doc to another, but It is hard letting go.  I will be taking tamoxifen and have been offered the chance to participate in a study for metforim.  After reading your posts about the tamoxifen, I think I should seriously consider the study.  I would monitored more closely and it would offer greater insurance against reoccurrence. ",

Karmil:  Glad to hear that you are doing well on post op day 2 and pleased with the girls! I was given \"Emperor of All Maladies\" when I was first diagnosed and encouraged to read it, but I haven't yet.  I also found it hard to concentrate while reading and thought it was a big undertaking.  Maybe now that I am feeling more coherent I will give it a try.",

I was given cytoxan/taxotere for 4 treatments every 21 days with the steroids before, during and day after my txs. I was also given Zofran IV during treaments and it really helped with my nausea.  So maybe it would have helped you also.  But, we are all different, so who knows.  I am glad that you have it now and it is helping with your nausea.  I know that you don't have much of an appetite, but try to eat.  I would get nauseous before hungry.  I found if I ate small portions of food the nausea would subside.  As with the baldness...no one likes it.  I agree that flashy earrings help!  There is a program offered by the American Cancer Society called \"Look Good, Feel Better\"  that I found helpful.  They teach you about skin care, make up and scarves/wigs/hats.  My local hospital offered it and it is free. It was nice to talk with other ladies, and they give you a bag of skin care and cosmetic products to take home.  I learned how to handle my thinning eyebrows and eyelashes which was helpful for me. RachelK: Good Luck with taking your Decadron. I hope your climb is an easy one!  Just remember it is the LAST time! I am off to my simulation today...hope all goes well.",

Normal...I'm not sure I will ever feel normal again. I am a 4th grade teacher and when I met with my MO, he told me that I would in no way be able to take the rigor of the job and keep up, so I needed to just take the rest of this school year off and get healthy for next year. So, I did. Since then, I have questioned my decision so many times. But, in reality, I know that there is no way I could have managed. Even now, a little over 2 weeks past my last treatment, my legs and arms have so much muscle fatigue, I feel like I am 90 years old! I have gained 10 pounds and nothing fits, my body is retaining so much fluid that you can't even see my ankle bones by the afternoon, I still get nauseated, and the list goes on. I am tired of feeling sick too and just want to get on with my life! This morning, I am going to try for another wig. I bought one...hate it! So I just wear scarves. I feel comfortable in my scarves and have gotten used to wearing them. I try all different styles to look stylish, and pair them with cool earings. Anything to feel better about the baldness. We'll see how it goes. Tomorrow, I go for my simulation and to meet again with my RO. I don't really have a date for the onset of the treatments I am thinking some time after Easter. I am planning to have lunch with my daughter earlier that day...mix a bit of good with the bad and ugly. I am trying to go in with an open mind. I, too, have people telling me that this is the easy part. Then, my nurse practitioner on my team tells me to make sure I get medicine to put on my skin for burns or blisters. It doesn't sound that easy to me. Oh, and the fact that my right breast will shrink from the radiation. That was news to me. I wonder how much?",
