Will probably meet with a MO the week I have my radiation treatments since his office is just around the corner from where I'm having the radiation.",

Due to the radiation, just about all of the scarring from my surgery is gone!  Kinda wished they could have hit the SN scar a few times while I was there.  No antiobiotics needed and the care from the nurses in cleaning 2x day and putting some extra gauze around a few of the more sensative the sites kept the redness down between treatments. Am now 2 1/2 mos since radiation and almost 3 weeks on arimidex (generic) and doing great!! Would be more than happy to \"speak\" with anyone that wants info about brachytherapy and APBI and the Az Breast Cancer group.  Kuske was the doctor who trains most of the doctors around the US as well as from outside the US on these type of treatments and was the guy who invented the SAVI.",
