It is almost impossible to imagine what THOSE women went through.   Next, there is no difference between an addiction and an addiction, and smoking is no different of a comfort to get through something awful any more than sucking you thumb in the corner with your Blankie would be !   Smoking is a real medical problem and should be addressed as one, with help and aids, and something other than the \"You are weak and stupid\" act, or worse, \"Go ahead, eat instead ?  That is a great one, Chemo didn't put enough weight on you ?     The Rad-Onc should be personally responsible for that decision that the \"QUITTING\" is complete and the woman is back into some sort of comfortable mode * before starting * ...... how hard can THAT be given today's resources ?  OK, OK, I do know that every step is even scary than the one that proceeded it, but where is everyones priorities ? ? ?    May God Bless all of these brave women, and give them inner courage beyond what they need.  Hang in there Kiddo !  Love, Bambers88 *Mother*  ~ ~ ~",
