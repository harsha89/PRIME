Usually when the fluid volume is 30 ml or less consistently for a period of 24 hours, you can have the drains removed, but that also depends on your PS.  And by the way, I had no drains at all for my exchange.  But some people do... Your mother is very sweet to be thinking ahead, but there are other things you'll need more than a drain garment.  You can make do very nicely with a set of big old safety pins (the two or three inch kind) and some sort of lanyard for around your neck.  I just pinned my drains to whatever I was wearing or put them in the pockets of my robe.  You can also fasten them with the safety pins to a lanyard (or a couple of shoelaces tied together for that matter) and they can hang from around your neck.  Personally I would have been pissed to have spent money on a garment I only used for less than a week... but that's just me.  I don't know if you have a recliner, but if you don't, maybe ask your mom to rent you one.  (You can thank me later.)  Most of us slept in a recliner for more than a few days after BMX.  I think I graduated to my bed after about a week and then was propped up with a pillow under each arm and about a dozen pillows behind and beside you.  Hope that helps you a little. ",

The answer to your question isn't as black and white as one would think. First, you need to take a deep breath. We've all been right where you are; and yes, waiting IS the worst part of all of this... Once they have your pathology report and you've agreed upon a plan, things get a little easier. Generally, you'll have a follow up with your surgeon a few days after your surgery and the pathology report should be ready by then. However, I have read where some women were able to access theirs within 24 hours; so it all depends on the facility and your doctor. Just be sure to request a copy for yourself and start a book / or box for all of your medical records. Take someone with you to your appointments if at all possible, because they'll be throwing a lot of information at you hard and fast. It really helps to have someone else in the room either taking notes or listening intently. Because believe me, you won't remember half of what you're being told. None of us did.

If at all possible, take someone with you when you get the pathology results from the biopsy.  (And ask for a copy for yourself.)  Not necessarily because it will be bad news, but just so you have another set of ears in the room.  This is all a big emotional roller coaster and you'll want to know exactly what was discussed.  Sending you a huge hug and a bigger prayer...

Also, I learned early on that it is a great idea to take someone with you to these kinds of appointments because (at least for me) my brain went into overload and there were things they said that I missed, but my friend was able catch.  Good luck and try not to worry too much.  You can do this!.  ",

Please know that there are hundreds of us who followed this thread and did what we could to encourage dear Cindi as she traversed the path she'd been given. Her raw honesty and emotion, not to mention her humor, charm, wit, and compassion, resonated with all of us. I'm so very sorry for your loss, but Rose fought her battle with everything she had and then some. Now she's free of pain and has shed that earthly body that had betrayed her for so long.

Sending a hug and a prayer.",
