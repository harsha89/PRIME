So far it hasn't been as bad as I was expecting, other than lots of bone and muscle pain. Well, and hair loss but I had fun with that part so it wasn't so bad. I've been having trouble finding places/people to talk to about everything that's been going on. It's nice to hear the stories of some people who know what this is all like.",

I am also from Canada and have found my treatment very agressive and fast and COVERED which is a godsend since I'm a student with no income, and had to drop my semester which means I loose more drug plan through school but the government has special plans for people with low income in my type of situation. I was 26 when Diagnosed. I found the small lump myself. I called my doctor who saw me 4 days later. She felt it and said \"there's definitely something there, given your age it's probably nothing, a calcium deposit or cyst or something, but let's get an ultra sound just incase cause you never know!\" So we did like 2 days later. Then they said we can't quite tell so just incase we're suggeting a biopsy. So that happened another 3 days later. Then I got a call less than a week later with results to come in and was diagnosed. That day I had a chest xray, and a mammogram, and had a bone scan, another ultrasound, and blood work ordered all for within that week. My surgery was performed literally 2 weeks after my diagnosis, so definitely no problem with speed or agressiveness on that part. After surgery I saw my MO about a month later to discuss if I needed Chemo. Did oncotype dx (I was 14) and she said I'm on the low end of mid range, but because it was grade 3 and I'm youung she still sugests TC x 4 in case. So we started a little over a week later. Just had #4 today (woot!) and Radiatino is now most likely starting around May 1st. (21 treatments, 16 to whole breast and 5 to tumor area). So certainly no issue with agressive treatment or speed toget anything done at all. Just felt I should share. :) Congrats to everyone ont heir journey so far btw. We are all awesome!!!! ",
