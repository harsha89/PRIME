I tested negative so have not had any follow up appts with genetic counselor, but I remember from my appt with her that we discussed the risks of the ability for my children to obtain life insurance if I had tested positive this summer and chose to have our children tested now and they also tested positive. We discussed this as 2 of our children are both in 20s and still in college. So neither have started their careers yet. And we have 1 child still in his teen years. ",

To date I have ran 28 miles total, plus have walked bunch too. Also continuing to do yoga and strength stuff. I feel really good. My 2nd infusion went better than first. I have my 3rd AC tomorrow. I go back to work next week and am a little nervous how that will go but have been feeling fine besides the usual fatigue and mild nausea the first 4 days following chemo and my work schedule has been adjusted accordingly. I really just want to plow thru this and continue my normal activities as much as I can. Think about you awesome ladies often...what a strong group of women we are. Hugs, prayers and love to all...",

I hadn't had much just a couple random beers since treatment started in July. I do think I was somewhat dehydrated. With everything we have had going on these past weeks I know my water consumption was down and Taxol is so drying. I also had been taking Tylenol instead of Ibuprofen for the bone pain. During AC he said no ibuprofen as it messes with stomach. Last treatment he said no Tylenol as it can mess with liver and to take ibuprofen instead! I did have 1 beer after my SILs funeral last week. I needed that 1. Praying my liver counts r OK! I have my second PT appt to check my arm on Friday this week. At my first appt the therapist said there were no signs of lymphedema. She wanted to see me again before radiation. I only had 3 nodes removed so hoping for more good news Friday! DD Taxol #3 tomorrow! Overall it will be treatment #7 out of 8. In 2 wks from tomorrow I will be done with chemo and moving on to radiation! I am craving a pumpkin craft beer like you won't believe!!  ",

I had a lumpectomy so that is the next step in this this journey for me. Leatherette..I was diagnosed at 46. Will turn 47 about a month after I finish chemo. Looking forward to celebrating with friends this year. Had treatment #7 on Thursday. One treatment left. Some tiredness today and mild neuropathy. Hoping it stays that way. My blood work at last chemo was good. RBCs have held their own...still right below normal at 3.50 and my liver counts went down quite a bit...must have been the Tylenol I took for the bone pain from Taxol. Starting to think ahead to life post treatment...I am finding it somewhat overwhelming right now. My family went to the our local university's football game today. We have season tics...its one of my favorite things to do in the fall. Saturday afternoon game as! I haven't been to a game yet this season. Missing it but am content today to watch game at home. I dont need to surround myself with 20,000 people right now. But looking forward to going to a home game in a couple weeks post chemo and there will be playoff games to enjoy late November!  ",

Sunnyjay...how is rads going for you besides the scheduling issues? That is ?what gives me the most anxiety about rads...their schedule, my schedule and how it will work! Seriously we deserve easy! How many do you have left? Travel...Hope the fluids perk you up a bit. I have a friend who received weekly chemo for ovarian cancer this past spring/summer, she received fluids frequently and it always helped her \"bounce\" back. Big news today...get my port OUT this afternoon! YAY! And Friday I have all my appts with radiologist to get radiation set up. I am 3 wks out from last chemo! Life is returning to normal. Side effects are mainly gone...some mild neuropathy in my toes (just feel in morning on my first steps out of bed and once in a while during exercising) and an extremely dry nose and feeling a little dehydrated when I forget to drink my water. Still some shortness of breath (esp on stairs) but exercising about 5x per week, running, walking, strength work and yoga. Am able to run for 30+min with out walk breaks... slow pace but just building my base up again. There is a pretty active bc support group in town. I have went to 1 event last month and plan to go to the monthly meeting next week. Trying it out to see if it is a good fit for me. Post Chemo Life feels pretty darn good! :) Wishing you all in the U.S. a very happy and blessed Thanksgiving. I am very grateful for all of you!  ",

I am a runner and prior to starting chemo I was a running about 4-5x per week and doing yoga and strength work a couple times per week. I kept up as much as I could during chemo. I had 4 treatments of DD AC and 4 treatments of DD Taxol, 8 treatments total. Since it was dose dense (DD) my treatments were every 2 wks. Usually day 5 following each chemo treatment I would feel up to running and working out and I would be able to get some runs and exercise in until the next chemo treatment. I also did a lot of walking on days in between my runs. As my treatments progressed my pace slowed considerably and I would have to alternate running and walking instead of just running. The biggest issue wlfor me was shortness of breath when running. Yoga felt great during chemo and I did that quite regularly. Keep doing what you are doing. You will slow down but keep at it as much as you can. Listen to your body and you will know what is too much. My Oncologist told me after finishing chemo that he believed the reason I did so well with side effects during chemo (particularly neuropathy with the taxol) and recovered so quickly after finishing chemo was due to the shape I was in prior to chemo and my activity level during chemo. It was really nice to hear him say that as I am pretty sure he thought I was crazy and was not overly supportive when I told him I was running during chemo. 3 weeks after finishing chemo I ran 4 miles with no walk breaks! It will take work but you will be back at your normal activity level sooner than later! Good luck!! ",

My counselor and physical therapist have both told me they have worked with other women who have continued to run some during chemo. They both told me to be willing to listen to body, have a slower pace, realize some days a run be just 1 mile instead of 5, and walk more. When people tell me i can't do something it makes me more determined to prove them wrong. I saw the internal eye roll and \"the oh honey you are so naive\" thought of my sister in law last week when I mentioned I hoped to run/walk/bike/exercise during my treatment on my good days. Her 70 yr old mom went thru treatment, 8 yrs ago so of course now she is an expert too. So I can't wait to tell her I am running and walking. Ugh! ",

I don't like to take a lot of meds...but what I am fighting now is different so I will take the meds. Just worry about how they affect me. My friend who is currently getting chemo said she tried to tough out the nause her first treatment, thinking it wasn't too bad. Well it wasn't bad at first but got worse and it didn't end well when she finally had to call in. I took her advice and decided NOT to tough it out. My nurse was pleased!!

Its a good reminder that there are blessings every day even if it doesnt always feel like it. My blessing today is that my down time this past week has given me the oppurtunity to play a lot of monopoly wih our youngest son...a 13 yr old. We dont always have time to sit down and play board games together for hours. We started this game last night and kept it up to finish today or tomorrow . My heart is full.",

Thinking either a cruise or San Diego. But also thinking that hubby and I should sneak away for a long weekend someplace soon! My hubby had his biopsy yesterday morning and received a call at lunch time today...NOT cancer. Has an enlarged prostate so they need to keep an eye on him and will go back in 6 months. What a scare but so very very happy. I will finish radiation this Friday and it truly feels like we can celebrate. ",

And thank you so much for sharing Taxol info so far....I start DD next Thursday. Doctor and nurses believe I will tolerate DD taxon well since I did \"fabulous\" (my drs words) with DD AC. I am still nervous. I have had some mild bone pain with my last 2 neulasta shots. I believe mostly because I have been a bit more forgetful about taking claritin the last 2 rounds. I did reach out a friend who sells Young Living Essential Oils. There is a blend to help with neuropathy. She is going to mix it up for me and drop off. I also have started nightly Epsom salt baths too with some peppermint essential oil for muscle fatigue. Willing to try anything to keep SE's to a minimum. I am feeling very well again this week...last AC was a week ago. Exercising, normal routine, cooking for my family, (which I love) working full-time. I love these good weeks. Mentally I am not doing as well. My sister in law who is also one of my best friendswas dx with late stage pancreatic cancer about 4 months before my breast cancer diagnosis. I had been so consumed with helping her and doing what we could for her and their family, my dx was very unexpected and frustrating. I have a lot of anger...I don't want to worry about myself I want to focus on her. I think that is partly why I am doing so well and so determined to just get thru this and not dwell on what I am going thru. There is also a lot of guilt. She is on a different journey than I am. I am fortunate to say my cancer is gone, my treatment is so it never returns. In January after radiation, I will be able to start putting this behind me. I am looking forward to the new year and doing everything I haven't gotten to do these past months. She has spent the past months doing things with her children and family as time is precious. She is struggling right now and could also use some prayers. I truly hate cancer. Hugs to all of you...I enjoy keeping up with how everyone's doing. Some days it is harder to come on than others and I just need to stay away. But I think of all of you often.",

I completed chemo yesterday. It's almost surreal. So much has happened... for the most part chemo went the way I had hoped. I had minimal SE's, worked around my chemo treatments and down days, and was able to do my normal on my good days. The hard was losing our sister in law. It was difficult and heart breaking. Miss her every day. I know I have not fully processed every thing that has happened these past months. I am sure that is coming. It was an emotional day yesterday. My hubby, mom and sister in laws mom came to chemo with me. I had picked up donuts from the favorite donut shop in town for those awesome nurses at my center, they are truly angels on earth. We had made a blanket in memory of my sister in law and yesterday my sister in laws mom and I gave the blanket to the cancer center. We requested that it be given to someone else suffering from pancreatic cancer who is in need of love, prayers and hugs. It was placed in a special spot away from the closet with the other donated blankets. They assured us it would be given to the right person. We are going to continue to make blankets 1x @ month for the patients at this center. A way of doing something in memory of my sister in law and giving back to a wonderful place who did so much for both me and my sister in law. Chemo was pretty uneventful. I had asked our 3 sons , my dad and my husbands parents to come up at end of chemo to watch me ring the bell. When we walked into the lobby i was greeted by our parents, our boys, my brother and his wife and 15 beautiful gals from my mom's group wearing pink!! Such a surprise..I had no idea. Found out my hubby can keep a pretty awesome surprise! There were tears and hugs and a bell was rang. I had mixed emotions about ringing that bell. It hurt to know my sister in law did not ring the bell and there are others who will not ever ring. But decided it was important for me and my journey and my boys wanted me to ring it and it was important for them so I rang it extra for my sister in law too. I know she was with me yesterday. We celebrated with a family dinner at new restaurant in town last night and I signed up for a holiday exercise challenge group I do every year. It starts next week and runs to the wk before Christmas. A perfect thing to get me back into the workout groove! It was a beautiful day. Thank you to all for sharing your journey on these pages. I too will keep checking in until the last person leaves. On to radiation!",

Also took advantage of our nice temps today and took our dog for a 30min walk outside. It was in the 40's and no wind. Its been cold and snowy here lately so a welcome warmup. I am still having a hard time running outside. The cold air seems to aggravate my shortness of breath. Running on the treadmill inside feels easier. Will probably be stuck on treadmill for a while.

Have exercised every day this week since Sunday. Will have my 2nd infusion next Tuesday. Trying to figure out how to manage the nausea a bit better. Stinks to have no appetite. It's not horrible but just feels like the 1st trimester nausea but this time not pregnant. I lost between 4-5# with the 1st infusion. My BMI is 19. I am not happy about losing any weight. I think keeping some crackers by bed and eating them right away in morning may help and adding a few protein shakes to my day. Also called my chiropractor about acupuncture yesterday to help with fatigue and nausea. Is anyone on this thread trying that? My Dr does not want me doing it on my low count days. But would love to try it the day after my chemo. I have to try something to get this nausea under control. As far as port...it's sore once in a while. No pain just dull ache. I ran the other night on treadmill...it bothered me a little bit nothing bad. I have the most trouble in car driving. The seatbelt hits it when I drive, but not when I am a passenger. It really bothers me then. I had the same trouble with damn seatbelt after lumpectomy. It would lay across my nipple and cause pain. That finally was better and now this. Will be happy to have this thing OUT!! Off to head out for a short run and walk. Then back to school shopping with a teenager!! Fun times!",

You truly do not know how horrible this is to go thru until you have gone thru this yourself. The appts, tests, biopsy, and the wait. It truly felt like the stress and nightmare was just beginning again, yet I did have moments of peace, where I remembered everything that I had been thru and that no matter what we found out we would be OK. My husband at one point said to me \"I really had no idea what you were going thru until now, it's different when it is not yourself.\" So grateful we received the results we did. My biggest fear was possibly having to tell our boys that their dad also had cancer. Between my diagnosis and losing their aunt to cancer at age 38, within this past year, they have had enough stress and did not deserve to have to go thru this again. Thank you again for the thoughts! Paulette please keep us updated on your husband too. From my research there does seem to be a lot of issues for men with their prostate as they age. My hubby is younger (49) but think the event of the past 10 months caused stress and may have caused this. ",

It looks and feels pretty good. Skin is just slightly darker in those areas and I still feel some tightness in the armpit area when doing yoga so just gently stretching. I made an appt to color my hair for next week. I am going to gal that I ordered wig from and she has colored post chemo hair many times. I just don't care for the grey. I want to look like myself again. Yes I know the grey is probably my natural color but the whole world does not need to know that. ;) I also started acupuncture this week. Hoping it helps with side effects (some stiffness and those damn hot flashes). I was unable to do acupuncture during chemo...My MO was concerned about an infection from the needles and said no when I asked. Nurses told me my MO just overly cautious with most things. Teese are you still doing acupuncture?  ",

I agree the absolute hardest thing so far was to tell the boys. It was gut wrenching. We have tried to be very reassuring and matter of fact with them, not giving all the details but we keep them updated and informed on what we think they can handle and when. When my MRI showed 2 more suspicious areas that needed to be biopsied, we told the boys that I had to go in for another test to make sure we had found all the cancer before my surgery. This was during college finals and I didn't want them worrying about there being more cancer and that being a distraction from studying. We are tying to keep our lives as normal as we can. It helps them to see me going about my normal, everyday life...working, meeting a friend for supper, picking our youngest up from practice, etc. Sure my mind is going 100mph some days but i try to very present and attentive when they around. Some day easier then others.I am lucky that I only work during the school year, so will be done for summer break this week.

I had a lumpectomy on Wed the 14th along with sentinel node biopsy. Everything went well. I had 2 tumors in right breast. I arrived at the day unit about 4 hrs before my scheduled surgery. I did have the wire placement done that morning before surgery, along with a mammo to make sure they were placed correctly and the dye for the SNB. I was numbed up pretty well for the wire placement and it wasn't so painful. The worst part was when they numbed the area around the deeper tumor. That was uncomfortable. Little discomfort when they put my breast between tbe paddles and it was somewhat uncomfortable in the position they had me on the table. But not any worse then the MRI biopsy I had a few weeks ago. It took about 40 min for both wires. I was still very numbed up for the dye procedure. That was quick and just slightly uncomfortable. My lumpectomy went well. I went home about 3 hrs after my surgery was completed. I feel good. Took 1 pain pill the night I went home before bed and have been fine with extra strength Tylenol since. I was groggy yesterday morning when I woke up, I am sure a combo of anesthesia and the other drugs they gave me for pain and nausea prior to surgery. We changed my dressings last night. Spending my days resting and icing. I get to shower later today! And now yes I wait for the results. I have a post op on Tuesday next week and my surgeon said he may call before that. Good luck to all of you, whose surgery is coming up and continued prayers for healing for those of you who have had surgery this month already. I did feel relief to have this pArt over. ",

Hard to believe it's my reality. My re-excision went well on Friday, and now we wait for results. I am dealing with some terrible anxiety and have an appt with hospital psychologist this week. The waiting is so hard and doesn't help that I am not able to run or work out...those things are what help me with stress. Also am having quite a bit more pain this time so didn't do much this weekend. A few friends visited and brought meals and I made it to all 3 of my son's baseball tournaments games...mama wasn't missing those! I suppose 2 surgeries on the same are in 10 days will most likely result in some added pain. The sentinel biopsy excision from 1st surgery continues to bother me and I can't do the exercises but at least the numbness is better. JenRuns..loved the pic of the burning bra!! Made my day! Have my appt with MO tomorrow and BS on Thursday. Praying this week is better news then last. Sending hugs to all of us! ",

None of us should. I am happy I finally reached out to both my minister and the psychologist at my cancer center last week. I tried to be so strong the past 2 months. It has felt like 1 step forward, 3 steps back thru out the whole process and I still don't know my treatment for sure. I just can't be strong right now. I have a very strong hubby, supportive family and a strong group of women friends who are by my side and promised me they won't be going anywhere for a very long time. I have had meals, cards, prayers, flowers, coffee dates, supper dates, calls, texts, visits and yet many days I still feel so alone. Now of us should feel like we have to do this alone.

Which my hubby frequently reminded me. ;)It feels long and agonizing but you need to know. For me I was diagnosed on April 26th. Met with my team of drs (mo, bs, ro) on April 28th. They decided I should have mri on both breasts. A wk later MRI showed 2 more areas of concern. Followed up with a mri biopsy 1 wk after that as I had hoped to do lumpectomy. 1 of those areas of concern was more cancer but close enough to first lump that we could go ahead and still schedule lumpectomy. I developed a BAD hematoma from the mri biopsy so we had to wait 4 wks for that to heal before BS would do lumpectomy. Finally 4 wks later I had my lumpectomy and did not get clear margins and discovered I had a positive node. My MRI and US prior had not shown anything in my lymph nodes. So chemo was for sure and needed a reexcision to get clear margins which I had 1 wk after 1st lumpectomy. MO made me wait 4 wks between my last surgery and starting chemo for complete healing. Had my pet scan after last surgery which was clean! So that was my process between diagnosis and chemo and it was hard. At times it felt like I took 1 step forward and 3 steps back. But I made it thru. I never used any anti depression meds...not anything wrong with it and I probably should have but was stubborn and didn't want to. I found my running, yoga and exercise to be the biggest help for me. And i also started seeing a counselor at my cancer center weekly. Good luck...soon you will be breezing thru treatment and this will all be a distant memory! ",

He said the chemo is causing it and not much I can do. Of course I didn't like that answer so turned to Dr Google when I got home 😊 Going to try upping my greens intake more (kale spinach etc) and lean red meat. Can't hurt and I just want to continue powering thru this and be done. Any other ideas? I talked to my MO about acupuncture when I first started AC as there is also research that shows it helps with fatigue too. My MO told me no...his concern was there are chances for bacteria with the needle pricks.😞 I really like my MO but he goes by the book for everything and doesn't like to take chances. I need to bring it up again as my WBC counts have remained very high with Nuelasta and I will continue with Nuelasta during Taxol. I did reach out to my friend who sells Young Living Essential Oils...she mixed up a blend that help with neuropathy and dropped off this week. She also brought over pan away oil for bone pain, there is also another oil we can try if that one doesn't work. So will be doing that until I get the acupuncture OK. 😉 Happy Friday!

I was told 6wks of radiation last spring. I have not seen my RO since end of April when I was first diagnosed and had my initial appt with my team. 6wks seems so daunting to me. I just want to be done and move on. It's good to hear it's going well for you ladies. I have my appt with RO and mapping next week. Radiation is set to begin on Dec 4th. Jen: so excited to hear how your weekend goes! Will be thinking of you and wishing you a wonderful weekend of memories and fun with your friends! Hope those of you feeling under the weather feel better soon! I had a minor head cold last week. Have managed to shake it but passed it along to my hubby first. Hot flashes interrupted my sleep pretty constantly during AC. They got better during Taxol. In the year prior to my diagnosis I had started having premenopausal symptoms..skipping periods for several months at a time and hot flashes. Anxious to see what my MO decides on hormone blockers. He has said he would like me to start on Tamoxifen and move me to an AI. We have talked about ovary suppression. I need to start looking into all of this. My brothers wife is an OB/GYN physician and her and I will be having a conversation on all of this. Also have my annual exam with my own Dr next week so will be a topic of discussion then too. My next appt with MO is Nov 28th.  ",

I started tamoxifen almost 2 wks ago. A few annoying se's but we are getting along ok. Will be on tamox until June then will have either a hysterectomy or oopherectomy and switch to armidex. I completed rads #22/33 today. 11 to go, 5 of which are my boosts. Also had my 6 m recheck with my BS! Hard to believe its been 6 mon sonce my lumpectomy. Scheduled my mammo for June. It feels like a time to start celebrating...my life is returning to normal but 2 wks ago we found out my husbands PSA came back high. He had it rechecked this week and still high. So now we move along to a biopsy. Could be a few things..inflammation being pretty common but of course the ugly C word is another possibility too. Hubby is not happy about having bx but we will both be happy whem we have an answer either way. It sorta feels like a nightmare that doesnt end. The worry amd anxiety have returned to our lives. Mostly I am just pissed off right now. If you pray say a few for our family. ",

Concerning the taste of water...I typically drink a lot of water every day. Gave up pop about 4 or 5 yrs ago. Since I run I like to have something extra to replace electrolytes. Gatorade is too sweet for me so I buy a product called Nuun. It has electrolytes but low sugar and no artificial sweeteners, colors etc. It's a much lighter taste then Gatorade but I love it. Lots of flavors too! There is also some with vitamins or caffeine as well. I plan on using this thru out chemo. Think it will help me drink more water. I order on Amazon but running stores and sporting goods stores carry as well. On Amazon it's a little cheaper and you can buy in a larger quantity. It comes in a tube and you drop a tablet into 16 ounces of water and wait for it to dissolve.  ",

Not sure how to count those days. Nuelasta knocked me on my ass last week...very fatigued, low appetite, mild nausea and some shakiness since last Wed evening. I am having some issues with constipation...most likely caused from meds, lack of running and lack of coffee in mornings. I am drinking a ton of water, nuun and some Gatorade. I am also tolerating La Croix. Still having some mild nausea. Was taking Comapazine but yesterday switched to Zofran. That seemed to help more. But think the nausea is caused some by constipation too. Need to figure out something for that. I hate taking pills/meds. I don't even use Tylenol for headaches...use peppermint essential oil with almond oil. So last week when Dr told me Zofran was 2nd choice, all I heard was don't tAke it. So I held off and held off. Finally gave in and felt better. I think I need to tell my Dr that the problem is not going to be me misusing these meds..the problem is getting me to take them at all. Did yoga yesterday and today hope to get a run/walk in on treadmill. It's horribly hot here. Also want to get some back to school shopping done this week and middle son moved back home this weekend from college apt for this school year so need to get his crap organized. I am excited to have him home though. Wishing everyone good days and minimal side effects.",

Some stiffness in Achilles and heals that sounds like a side effect from chemo and the Tamoxifen. Ibuprofen is helping and going to talk to my chiropractor this week about some possible graston therapy. She has always fixed me up before with running injuries! 😊 I ran 8 miles yesterday and feeling very hopeful i will be able to run my half marathon in May. I missed it last spring due to my diagnosis. Will have surgery in June when done with work for summer and switch over to Arimidex after. Currently doing well on Tamoxifen besides the joint stiffness in mornings.

Registered for my spring half marathon last week. It's going to be tough...not in the best of shape this year but running has helped me thru some hard days this past year and I just feel this will be a healing way to close out my first year post diagnosis. Will either be having a full hysterectomy or ovary and fallopian tube removal in June. Ob/Gyn doc says to take it all. My oncologist says as far as he is concerned he only wants me to remove my ovaries/tubes. I am still undecided. I have the surgery scheduled but need to make a decision instructions soon. Would love the thoughts and reasons from you ladies that have done 1 or the other since diagnosis. Since I had a lumpectomy this should be my final surgery for a while. ",

My sister in law last night reminded me of how much us runners can handle...we r strong and you will come out on the other side of this stronger. Someone told me a few wks ago...\"it's a marathon, not a sprint\" I have ran 1 full marathon, usually half's. But I think back to the full I ran..it was painful and I probably hadn't trained properly and I wanted to quit so many times that day, but I didn't and finished. And later thinking back on it, the pain became a distant memory and I am so much stronger as a person because I ran that marathon that day and did the training. That's true for all of us ladies here. Susan..I saw you typed munich, went back and couldn't find anyone with that name but assumed i missed something included \"Munich\" in my post too! LOL!

My HER 2 came back negative and MRiI showed the size as 1.7 cm. but the MRI 2 wks ago found 2 more small suspicious areas in same breast as the original cancerous lump that had to be biopsied. My lymph nodes were clear on both US and MRI and nothing showed up in other breast on the MRI. I had the MRI biopsy last week, one spot came back clean and one came back showing cancer. It is a very small spot (7mm) so my BS is still recommending a lumpectomy. But I also developed a gigantic hematoma so will see the BS this week so he can look at it and will hopefully get a date for surgery. It needs to resolve before we can schedule surgery and it is still very swollen. I am also waiting for the rest of the pathology report back on this 2nd spot. My BS said most likely same cancer in 2 areas but I go online and read and worry about this one being HER+. I hate the waiting..it just gives me more time to worry. With the hematoma, my nurse navigator said I should not be running or anything high impact until it is healed. Walking does not relieve my stress. I feel like I take one step forward towards starting a treatment plan and then there is 2 steps back. have a week and half of work left until I am done for the summer break and then can just worry about myself and my family.

I have never had much stress in my life and normally a very happy, strong and positive person. I need to hold on to the positive and keep moving forward. My best friend lost her only child in a car crash several years ago. I remember telling her many times...All you need to do is take 1 day, 1 hour, or 1 moment at a time. Nothing more then that. Some days it will take all you have to take a moment at a time, some days may be a little more, but keep moving forward little by little. I need to take my own advice.

I am currently finishing up chemo (2 treatments left) and then on to radiation. Everyone tells you that the beginning when there are so many unanswered questions is the worst and they are right. I suffered thru quite a bit of anxiety. I will tell you anxiety can do horrible things to you. During those early weeks prior to to my surgery and pet scan and when we still didnt know everything and was I was still having mris, biopsies, etc. I suffered with shortness of breath, back pain in shoulders and low back, numbness and tingling in arms and feet, migraines, vertigo, vision wasn't good, etc. I suffered thru a lot. Every new symptom meant the cancer was some where else. I will tell you it was a horrible time. But my pet came back clean and as I learned my treatment plan things improved. It was all anxiety and those symptoms improved and disappeared. And my life became a little more normal again. Hang in there, talk to your dr about your symptoms but remember this is a stressful situation and our bodies can do weird things when we experience stress. Just be gentle to yourself.

Just the steroids in my pre meds they have me in IV day of infusions. Not sure what I will have with Taxol. Interesting how all our drs do it a little different. I am sure so much depends on patient. It was interesting talking to my chemo nurse last treatment. We were talking about me doing DD Taxol...she mentioned very rarely do they see patients receiving it at my cancer center. She added that my Dr must believe I will handle it alright. I know that was supposed to make me feel good but it kinda made me anxious. LOL! But I am happy to say I half way done!! Have you received 1 or 2 taxol so far?",

So far Taxol is much better for me! The bone pain and dryness are my biggest side effects. I only experience the bone aches below my waist and at night when i lay down. Ibuprofen and Young Living Pan Away essential oil mixed with almond oil rubbed onto my legs at bedtime both help with the bone pain. I just experience the bone pain on days 3-5 and then it subsides until next treatment. I haven't ran for 2wks. I am so slow and have been doing some walking. This week I feel more energized and think I am going to go for a run/walk after work tonight. I love running in the fall and so missing my runs right now.",

I am anxious to get this hair growing. I received a call from my radiologists nurse this morning. Have first appts the Friday after Thanksgiving and will begin rads the following week!

I feel very good for going thru what I have gone thru...the bone pain kept me awake last night and didnt allow me a decent nights rest, thats all. It will be better tonight. Bone pain has been 1 of my annoying side effects from taxol. Since chemo was done last thursday I am eating pretty clean again, starting to exercise more consistently, going to bed at 8pm every evening which is what i did 85% of time thru chemo. Just being very conscious of using these next few weeks to get as healthy as possible before rads start. Its exactly what i did between surgery and chemo starting. And i made it thru chemo standing and amazed my dr with how well i did and how well my counts were. He told me he had never seen some finish chemo with such good counts! I am not going to allow my body to crash...i am feisty, stubborn and determined and dont want people to feel sorry for me! I know of many that are going thru something much more rough than i am right now. My side effects are temporary and I am blessed to be able to continue with my life. I truly believe its all in the attitude",

Hair is growing, nails look good and my skin is starting to look better. But eyelashes and eyebrows are still sparse. My skin got so dehydrated during chemo. It really took a toll on it. I have always had oily skin and now it's so dry. A weird thing happened this week...I woke up about a week and half ago to a tender/ sore spot on jaw. I had appts with my radiologist, Gyn Dr and MO the past 10days so I brought it up to all of them. They all felt it and said it felt like a swollen gland and said we could leave it and it would resolve on own. Well yesterday morning I woke up, it was visibly swollen and more painful. Called MO and my dentist. The consensus is that I have a stone in one of my salivary glands. Been having to suck on lemon slices, sour hard candy, up my water intake etc and it should dissolve on own. It can happen with a dry mouth and I have had an extremely dry mouth since chemo ended and I wasn't as good about drinking my water after chemo ended. So now I am bald with little to no eyebrows and eyelashes and a swollen lump on my lower cheek! I told hubby the fun never ends!",

Felt so positive it was hormone related. About a yr ago I had hot flashes and no period for 4 months. They started up on May of last year and did not have any hotflashes for several months and had regular periods. About a week before I found lump, i started my period. My hormones were crazy, having hotflashes, broke out with acne, breasts ached. Then I found the lump. On Monday I came on here and deleted my posts, telling myself it was so silly I had posted on here, it wasn't cancer. Yesterday i received the news...ILC , estrogen + , and hormone fed.

Distractions are good right now but at times it hits me hard. This morning I went out and ran 6 miles, crying the entire last mile home realizing this would most likely be my last longer run for a while. I had 2 half marathons I was going to run this fall. I guess I wasn't expecting the emotions to hit me this weekend. I have been so focused on just wanting to start so I can get this part over but it's scary. I don't work in the summers, and I always love my summers off. Morning runs, coffee on my deck in the morning and a glass of wine on my deck in the evening with a good book or my hubby, taking our son to the pool in the afternoons, time to run errands and meet friends for coffee or a beer. It just really feels like this is the end of my summer right now. Cancer takes so much from us and it makes me angry. I go back to work the end of Aug and I worry about working while completing those next 5 treatments after I go back. ",

I am still running on my good days...slower than normal but feels normal to get out there. Celebrated AC #4 by buying a new pair of running shoes!! They were much needed. Went back to work part-time 2 weeks ago. Most days feel normal and that's a good thing. A little bone pain from Neulasta...doing claritin, Epsom salt baths and Tylenol occasionally. Also doing a lot of yoga with my running. Fatigue on days 3 & 4 post chemo are my biggest side effects. I think I am too stubborn to do anything but kick this cancer in the ass! Think of all of you often...sending hugs and positive thoughts your way.",

I am a planner :) so it's helpful to read what others have gone thru. Sunnyjay: let me know how you like the LiveStrong program. I am looking at that too. Need to find out when the next session starts and get signed up! There is also another free program at my gym...I get 6 free sessions with a personal trainer (2x/wk for 3 wks). I am definitely going to take advantage of that too! Purplestargazer: I shaved when hair started coming out in mid Aug. I have thick hair and it was a MESS! Right before 4th AC, I lost most of my stubble...but have new growth that is very light and hard to see but I can feel it!  ",

Finished DD Taxol #2 today! Only 2 treatments left, 4 weeks left! We had a fun family spring break trip to AZ with our boys in March, about 2 weeks before I found my lump. We were also able to do our summer vacation to my nephews wedding. It fell after surgery and 2 wks before chemo started. I am lucky nothing has been cancelled and we r hoping for a big family trip to San Diego next summer. A few weekend trips are also in works. Hanging in there this week...hospice has started for my sil. These past months have been very overwhelming.",

I felt the same on Monday. Got the call from my radiologists office scheduling my upcoming spots. After the high of being done with chemo last week, I was cranky on Monday thinking ahead to 6wks of rads EVERY SINGLE DAY! :( I gave myself 10 min to feel sorry for myself and then moved on. Staying positive during this battle has helped me so much during this battle. I just need to take these next weeks a day at a time. Teese...I too am SICK of dr appts! The week of Thanksgiving,I have been blessed with 4! 2 on Wednesday and 2 more on Friday. I had an appt with the counselor from my cancer center this Friday morning. I just cancelled it. I know she thinks I need to see her but I need a break. And I dont think the appts with her have been overly helpful anyway. Our son is off school on Friday and last night I told him he could have a few buddies sleepover on Thursday and decided I want to be home that morning to pick up donuts for the kids and be a mom. Our lives have been so consumed with cancer since April, we all deserve a break! Day 7 since final chemo...rough night last night with bone pain. Forgot to use my essential oil and take Ibuprofen before bed. Some mild neuropathy in feet today but overall doing good. Looking forward to a relaxing weekend",

I started my holiday running/workout challenge today! Ran on our treadmill for 35 min straight with no walk breaks. Did a 5 min cool down walk. It was slow but it felt good. Also took advantage of our nice temps today and took our dog for a 30min walk outside. It was in the 40's and no wind. Its been cold and snowy here lately so a welcome warmup. I am still having a hard time running outside. The cold air seems to aggravate my shortness of breath. Running on the treadmill inside feels easier. Will probably be stuck on treadmill for a while. Finished the day with 30min of restorative yoga before climbing into bed. Tired muscles but feels good! 11 days since my final chemo. A little neuropathy in feet that comes and a goes every once in a while. Feeling good, still feel very dry...trying to keep drinking lots of water during g the day. Energy level is good.     ",

Exercise is important to me and I wanted to make sure I didn't overdue it when I started back. I had NO signs of lymphedema and was given the ok to start yoga and move on to weights a few weeks later. You only had 5 nodes removed, hopefully you will not have any problems either! But you can ask your surgeon for a referral to PT and they can help you with that. I saw my PT again before starting radiation. Everything still looked good and I have been doing yoga, weights and strength work regularly since mid August.",

It is going well! Skin is holding up well and I am feeling good...no fatigue. Some muscle stiffness that seems to be a side effect leftover from chemo as it started a few weeks after I finished chemo. My MO said that is normal. Started Tamoxifen last weekend. Have taken 5 doses and no horrible SE's that I am aware of. Take at bedtime and do possibly feel a little more muscle aches at night but not sure if it's just the after effect from chemo or if the med is causing some of this too and have noticed dye eyes like I had during chemo but I also live in the frozen tundra called ND and our furnace has ran non stop for the past 2 wks as we have experienced well below normal temps and wind chills. Am going to start acupuncture next week to see of that helpless. I will have my ovaries removed in the spring and switch to Armidex after that. Registered for my spring half marathon this week and will start training for it the end of this month. I know it won't be my speediest half marathon, but I am willing to bet my last dollar that when I finish this one, I will never have been more proud of myself! I will run it a little over a year after my diagnosis and I can't think of a better way to celebrate being 1 year out! I check into BC.org pretty regularly still... I have been posting over on the daily exercise thread. It's a good fit for me. Never got into the Facebook group...felt it was too large. Wishing all of you the very best as we head into the new year and are finishing up our treatments! Love hearing everyone's updates! ",
