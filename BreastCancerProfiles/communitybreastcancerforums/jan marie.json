Your doctor said that wasn't possible, but here's an article I found last night that said that it could be a fibromatosis, The name of the article is \"Fibromatosis: The Breast Cancer Imitator\" and it was published in Southern Medical Journal, 2004 Vol. 97, No. 11, pp 1100-1103. Of course your doctor would need to evaluate the atricle, but at least it proves that a spiculated mass could be a fibroadenoma and not a cancer.",
