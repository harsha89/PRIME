    "Content": "MatchlessAshley wrote: Both sides of my family have a history with breast cancer. A month ago I found a lump at 22 years old on my left breast. We did an ultrasound and it was complicated cyst. My right breast was negative. A week after the ultrasound I find a lump on my RIGHT breast. Doctor does another ultrasound. Right Side still came back negative, but because it was negative but i clearly have a lump doctor ordered for An MRI, later this month. Now theres a red spot on my right breast. Doctor said that's a bug bite. But it doesn't look like one. It\u2019s a red flat spot on my lump about a size of a quarter. MRI test is weeks away. Worrying Log in to post a reply",
