No problems at all and I even ate crackers.  They sent me home with compazine (?) and lorazapan for nausea if I need it after the long acting one wears off.  Go in for nuelasta shot tomorrow.  Will keep you posted on side effects which are sure to come.  I know that future treatments might not go as well but was very encouraged that the first did.  Thanks to all for the great information you all posted.",
