My name is Amy, I've been reading through so many posts on the message boards here, especially this one as I too started chemo on January 11. It's so nice to hear about everyone's experiences and advice! My side effects weren't horrible after my first treatment. Some days were definitely better than others but I feel pretty lucky. The fatigue has been hard to get used to since I feel tired all the time. My hair is starting to come out pretty quickly now which is tough to see. They told me it would start at about two weeks out but I was hoping to be the exception!! I keep telling myself it's only hair and it will eventually grow back and stay focused on the long term result of being a survivor!! I already have a couple of wigs. I have to say I don't really like how they feel on. I don't feel like myself. I'm sure I'll get used to them. My daughter is home from college this weekend so we are going to shop for some hats with hair sewn in. I thought that would be better for quick shopping trips. I look forward to getting to know you all as we go through this crazy journey together!",

      "Content": "Jan 28, 2017 12:12PM - edited Jan 28, 2017 12:19PM by Alffee Good morning all! Thisisme4no - Glad to hear your first session went well. I had my port put in 2 days before my first treatment and understand that soreness. Did they give you numbing cream to put on an hour prior? They gave me some cream and told me to put Press and Seal on over it to keep it on until I got to the center for treatment. It worked for me as I didn't feel the needle go in at all. I felt great for the first 2 days and had a ton of energy! I have lost about 5 pounds after the first treatment, mainly because I had some stomach issues and wasn't eating much and my taste buds have been effected as well. Unlike you, I can stand to lose some weight so I look at it as a positive of all this!! Let me know how it goes if you decide to shave your head this weekend. I've read some decide to opt for a close buzz cut instead but not sure if that eventually falls out too? I'll probably just shave it all off and get it over with. I know I won't last more than maybe another week at the rate it's falling out. Fortunately I have thick hair to start with so the thinning may take a little longer. I'll be thinking of you as I know it will be very emotional. Good luck this week - I hope things don't get too bad for you! Goincrzy - I too am sorry to hear about the delays in your treatment. I can't believe under the circumstances they don't push things along - when you get this diagnosis, all you want to do is start killing it. It makes me feel fortunate I haven't experienced that so far. I was diagnosed on 12/15 so I had the holiday schedules to deal with but was able to have all the tests, MRI, EKG, CT and Bone scans done, port put in and have my first treatment on 1/11. I hope things move along faster for you. Have any of you had an issue with watery eyes? The past couple days my eyes have been watering like crazy. I read that can be a side effect. It's annoying more than anything. I'm hoping it goes away quickly. I also am noticing that my skin is incredibly dry. I'm going through lots of lotion I hope you all have a great weekend! I'm off for some more wig shopping!",
