I have very dense breasts, but this was in the one area I had thought didn't have any denseness in it, so it concerned me. No other symptoms. I made an appt for an ultrasound (hadn't been having them; the doctor had mentioned my needing them at the time), and the radiologist saw it instantly (though she didn't tell me about it; the surgeon the told me the next day). They were so sure that if the biopsy had come back benign, they would have gone in again for another biopsy.",

The breast surgeon thought I was okay, but had me come for follow-ups for a while, then a year or two later, he said I didn't have to come back. Turns out, my surgeon estimates the tumor's been growing 5-7 years. Really made me wonder. I wish I'd been more proactive then, instead of not asking questions and just doing what everyone told me. Never again.",

All the best, Mindy ",
