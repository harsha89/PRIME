I had my drains removed after 4 weeks and I still have pain due to fluid build up on my left side. Every time I go in for an expansion my dr drains 30-40 mls manually from the breast. Is anyone else dealing with this? I am worried my reconstruction is starting to fail. I know there is no infection bc I am allergic to most antibiotics and never have taken any. No fever or illness.....just fluid. Thx, you all inspire me!!!!",

All these discussion boards champion getting help for physical side effect but rarely do I see treatment for emotional side effects being encouraged. I don't believe myself weak or flawed when I tell you this was too hard for me. I am a faithful women who ultimately needed anti depressants to fight this cancer. I thank God for the gift of science and medicine and would encourage those of you struggling to be brave and ask for help. There are wonderful medicines available. My wonderful dr. knew I was used to being super mommy ( aren't we all) and thankfully told me to expect depression/anxiety. At the first signs I felt safe with him to ask for help. This may me the hardest challenge of our lives! Cancer sucks! Please tell your Dr. ALL of your side effects, not just the physical ones. :) Be blessed ladies!",

It was very difficult but as the ladies before me wrote there are lots of things available to help with the side effects. I had many side effects so the best advice I can give is \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease.\" Don't be a martyr- tell your dr about nausea, vomiting, fatigue, mouth sores, peeling skin, nail darkening, constipation, depression, anxiety etc. And if their first solution doesn't work, ask again. It was the hardest thing for me-To feel like a whiner but side effects can be debilitating. I can't imaging recovering from a bmx and starting chemo! You are ladies are champs!",

Tank tops are not forgiving- lumps and my bald head are hardly discreet but hats, wigs an scarfs are tooooo hot. Thoughts?
