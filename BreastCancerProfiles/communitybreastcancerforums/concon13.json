However, I just had blood work done today and my marker (CA27.29) rose from 1,190 to 1,780.  It has been exactly 2 weeks since I had the SIR-sphere treatment in  1/2 of my liver.  I have been extremely tired, more than ever before, yet they were very clear that this is a side effect. I didn't believe I could ever get \"more\" tired .....and wow ...I am.  I'm feeling hopeful that this treatment will work, but today was a shocker as I thought the numbers would drop not rise.  I know we can't bank on markers, yet the increase of 500+ is bothering me. I know after some treatments markers can rise, just need to know if anyone has had this experience.  I meet with the interventional radiologist next week and I'm not very patient these days.  Thanks in advance for anyone who shares their experience.
