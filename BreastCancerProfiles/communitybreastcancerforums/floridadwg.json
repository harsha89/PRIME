The fear is caused from the ribs on the side of the surgery site not directly underneath but midway down. feels as if i have been punched there almost double up when touched there. has progressively gotten worse in the past week. still have some burning sensations under the scar and and occasional sharp pains.not wanting to be paranoid but how do we know if it is the bones? The sugeon felt he got it all this time and I don't see the oncologist for another week. I am scared this is all so new to me. Log in to post a reply",
