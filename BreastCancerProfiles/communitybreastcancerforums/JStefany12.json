I was told that you can insist on being sedated - just tell them you have anxiety issues.  I intend to do that every step ofthe way from now on.   Hope you are doing ok now. ",

Even if some of the stuff that happens in my life really sucks.  I'd like the chance to correct things, change things, go a different dircetion, do something different.  In other words, the prevention of premature death makes sense to me.  That is how I've been coping with all this.  I was very wrapped up the moment, but it is better at this time to take a more \"global\", objective view.  Get someone to hold your hand, and press right through.  My thoughts are with you.
