    "Content": "Dylan1 wrote: My partner was diagnosed with secondary bc in Nov. 2010 with mets in her liver, pancreas, lungs and bones. After having headaches, vision and balance problems in March 2011, an MRI scan revealed that the cancer had spread to her brain. She had WBR and then in July was put on Lapatinib and Capecitabine. The reast of the cancer had responded well to Herceptin and she was doing very well throughout 2011. In February this year she started getting headaches again and a feeling of numbness in her left leg. Steroids were prescribed which stopped the headaches, but the numbness grew worse until she could not move it anymore. Quickly it spread to her right leg and within a week she went from being able to walk to being permanently in a wheelchair. She is also incontinent of bladder and bowels. A MRI scan revealed a small tumour at the top of her spine which was given a single treatment of radiotherapy. That was eight weeks ago and she has not got any feeling back. The oncologist thought that most of the problems are to do with the mets in her brain, but we had hoped that the radiotherapy may have helped. At the moment she is free from any headaches and apart from a some pain in her neck and generally feeling very tired is coping well and with great courage.  She has now declined any further treatment and I am  looking after her at home with assistance from district nurses and regular contact with the hospice nurse.  She is being incredibly brave, but not knowing what to expect next is in some ways the most difficult thing to cope with. Is this a unique situation or does any one have experience of this and can say what we might expect. Log in to post a reply",
