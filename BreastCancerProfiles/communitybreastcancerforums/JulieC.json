I had 2 injections on either side of my lump site and the other 2 around the areola.  They even had someone there to keep my feet down if needed.  I couldn't reach my husband's hand, but he would have lost a few fingers if I was holding his hand.  I just put a towel over my head and waited for it to end.  It wasn't bad a few minutes later.  The entire crew was apologetic and said how well I did.  Lisa, you were so lucky not to have pain.  At that point in my BC travels I didn't now about Xanax.  I would definitely ask for something now since I know better. I had the blue dye injected the next morning after I was out.  It has been 19 months and I still have a large sized \"stain\" that looks like a blue/green tatoo.  It has faded but I still volunteer the explanation before anyone thinks that my dh abuses me LOL.  But, as everyone earlier has mentioned, I would rather go through 4 injections rather than risking my health with an AND. I wish I knew about this site right from the beginning.  I was already scheduled with a surgeon who only did AND's and found out that I could go with a SNB done by a different surgeon.  It pays to do the research. Pat - just keep coming here and you can find info on just about anything you want to check out.  Good luck with your future treatments. Julie",

Don't worry about the negativity/positveness of your posts.  Some days you just have to vent and this is the perfect place to do it.  We \"get\" it, when others don't so rant away.  We've all had similar experiences so we will be glad to help you out.  As far as knowing what is going on - do you have copies of your pathology reports from both procedures?  If you do, you can even ask us questions about them.  Sometimes doctors can be wrong or miss something.  You have to stick up for you and don't quit until you are satisfied with the answers you are getting or until you feel your questions have been taken of. Come back whenever you feel like and take care - Julie",

Sorry about the conjunction junction talk.  That was just the first thing I thought of with my daughter.  Karin your description of our bc compared to School Rock was just as good as the pictures your provide.  I just remember all of the songs from Saturday morning.  They were just the 5-minute little dittie between cartoons.  I'm 46 so we are mostly in that time range.  I don't think the kids today appreciate those kinds of things because they have cartoons and what not available 24/7 somewhere.  We did buy the whole DVD.  I think my husband and I liked it better than the girls, but they still watch it.  The preamble helped my 7th grader with her constitution test this year.  I'm not familiar with the \"chicken fat\" song mentioned above.  My kids had to learn the 50 Nifty song in 3rd grade so I know most of it. Jean - my song pick would be \"I Won't Back Down\" - Tom Petty - was the first song played at the first rads appointment. Otter - I hope you are feeling happier today.  I get sad, and upset with myself.  Don't know if it is from early menopause (chemo induced).  Yesterday was such a nice time with my girls then we get home and the house is a mess.  I keep telling a friend that you would think I would have learned my lesson about things and time and sweating the small stuff, but I have a hard time with that.  I always worked and was good at it.  BC came along 4 months after I quit so I didn't really have a \"normal\" establashed before it was time for another \"normal\".  I feel like I need to do something, just don't know what.  I don't want to work full time like I did before.  It is nice to be home when the kids are sick or when you have \"contusion confusion\" moments come along. I hope everything was okay at your house.  Boy - snow and tornadoes all in a few days.  Karin - I think we need a \"when pigs fly\" picture for that. Noelle - definitely email me about the pj.  I'm curious. RanD - how was your weekend? Hope everyone else had a nice, relaxing weekend. Thanks for reading (listening). Julie",

Karin - how are things with your daughter today?  Did you come up with any new ideas?  How about you Gracie?  I keep thinking of the little ones and wish I had the right things to say. Sue- how many sleeps until your last day?  This month is moving pretty fast. Yea RanD - another week down without the draining business. Karin - what is the Deva hair cut all about compared to a regular cut.  Does it work with our short chemo hair? Got back tonight from a Girl Scout sock hop.  Our children don't know anything about such things.  My daughter was appalled that I wore my capris, bobbie socks, pink lipstick and pink scarf which happened to be one of those Ford Warrior women pink scarves.  I have 4th and 5th graders in my troop and they warmed up after a little bit. Here is your girl scout trivia for the day.  Today was the 97th birthday of Girl Scouts.  The first ones were registered in 1912.  Another sisterhood going strong. Good night to our sisterhood!

Linda - is your daughter having a Sweet 16 party?  Gumbo sounds good. Gardening sounds good - I almost have daffodils - just a few more days.  And I like the sound of a persimmon colored kitchen.  We've been in our house 8 years and the people before us (my daughter's math teacher) had a large, brightly colored paisley print on lots of walls - kind of made you sea sick if you looked at it too much.  We rented a steamer to take it off and it was the best money every spent.

Kerry - very sorry for your little guy.  That does just break your heart.  Sending prayers to his family.  You asked about the backpacks.  Twice a year our scouts do a community service project.  This one involved buying backpacks and school supplies for kids that can't afford them.  We used the proceeds we earned from cookie sales and some girls donated items personally.  We filled them with crayons, markers, glue, ruler, notebooks, basic supplies.  I found decent backpacks at Wal-mart that would work for either girls or boys.  We always participate and the girls get cool patches.  We helped the local food pantry in the fall.  We've planted trees at the local nature center and helped at the local humane society in the past.  The girls love anything where they can give back to the community. My dad did come home from the hospital today.  Still has antibiotics and prednisone, just not the large doses.  He was feeling pretty good and was glad to get home.  My aunt was having tests done and working with a neurosurgeon at a hospital in Columbus, OH so we really don't know too much yet.  My mom did talk to her so that was good.  Only one more day of March - please get us through it.

You two look like you are and have been best frends forever, just like Eddie and Adrienne.  I hope the same thing can happen with Robin and Jen. Dana - I'm so glad you posted.  We've been wondering about you, but there's no pressure to check in.  You did a great job keeping track of everybody.  I can't keep up some days. Sue - how are you doing this week?  Can you believe it's been a week already?  RanD and Noelle - how are you girls today? Rock -  I met a woman Saturday while the scouts were planting flowers who is here, but goes home to, wait for it, Cape Town, two months in the summer.  So, since it is such a small world, tell Barb from Illinois, I said HI.  I didn't ask which two months, so just keep your eyes and ears open.  I told her all about you and our group.  I think most people think I'm crazy when I talk about my cyber friends because they just couldn't understand. I am so thankful for all of us because we all get each other. Jen - it's time for a reprise of your blue footed boobie bird. My blue is just a little higher up.  Today is my SNBiopserversary and my boob is still light blue.  The different doctors said the dye could remain for 6-9 months, but this is crazy.  Anyone else know anyone that stayed stained permanently? Oldest dd is going with middle school band to Six Flags by St. Louis for a music competition and to play at the park.  Dh is going as a chaperone.  He is in charge of 6 7th grade girls.  I hope he survives the day.  They meet at the school at 5:30 am on Friday.  He does get to drive himself - doesn't have to ride the bus.  My dd doesn't really like rides, doesn't even go on escalators, so that could also present some challenges. Other dd has been carrying older dd's trumpet to the bus stop every morning this week.  When I asked why, older dd is going to pay younger dd $5 per week to carry it maybe two blocks.  It will add up to about $20 by the end of the school year.  I think I'd like that part time job.  Just goes to show that in these tough economic times, \"entre-manure-ship\" is thriving at our house. Please keep telling me that I will survive the teenage years and we've only been here for 5 months.  Hugs to all - Julie ",

Rock the bald - same to you on going \"bald bald\".  Maybe that's what I want to try when my hair comes out.  I keep feeling like a bought a wig for a lot of other people, but not necessarily because I wanted me.  Let us know how it goes and any reactions you get. Robink - I'm definitely feeling better today.  I think I got in such  panic when I didn't feel well that I overdid all of the meds.  I'm trying to stay hydrated - not something that I do well when not undergoing chemo.  I just can't stand water.  We did buy some of the Special K protein water and it isn't too bad.  I had all of the anti-nausea meds and called and got more once I was at home.  Now I'm just going with a less is more approach and only taking what I really need. To all the newbies - keep asking the questions because we all learn something with each new question asked. Thanks, Julie",

I'm curious how the face down positioning works.  We'll be anxious to hear the details.  Maybe they have \"fun\" pictures on the floor. Julie",

Otter - sounds like you have the patience thing under control.  When my girls were little they watched Barney.  Let's all sing now: \"I love you, you love me, we're a hap-py fam-i-ly\".  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  Those were painful to watch. Thanks for the birthday wishes and the prayers.  The surgery is early tomorrow.  I have my bag with lots of reading material to keep me occupied and hopefully quiet.  \"Shovel\" is packed, also.  The plan is to remove the upper right lobe.  Surgeon still couldn't tell if the tumor is up against the edge of the lung or growing through towards the mediastinum.  He said he can get margins on the bottom of the lobe.  We have the understanding that if he gets in and can't remove the tumor safely, he will close him up.  I don't know if he still might be a candidate for any adjuvent treatment.  I will report back when I get a chance. We had a nice weekend: leisurely breakfast at Cracker Barrel and then we went to our local nature center and made ornaments out of natural items and all kinds of donated craft supplies.  DH turned a pinecone into a lovely moose ornament and Katie made the cutest squirrel out of the supplies.  Riley's approach involves googly eyes.  Everything she made had them (a shell, wooden ball, ear of indian corn) and the more glitter the better.  Last time we went she covered stuff in brightly colored feathers and of course - more googly eyes.  Those are my favorite things.  And I do have 6 ornaments on the tree.  We are making progress.

I also have the brain mush.  I don't even know how to explain it.  I definitely can't complete my thoughts, let alone sentences.  My husband says I always interrupt him when he is talking, but if I don't say \"it\" (whatever it might be), I won't remember by the time he is done talking.  We raise our hands to talk, just like in grade school.  If I point a finger (no not that one!) it helps me focus on what I want to remember.  I might use the other one for different situations.  This helps if I need to write something down and am in another room.  I walk throught the house with my finger up like \"aha\", and the kids know not to distract me because I am on a mission.  I still get so overwhelmed with all of the tasks that think I need to do.  I know the cold and dark doesn't help either.  I definitely believe in SADD.  We've had a few hours of sun in the last week and that seems to help.  I just want to shut down as soon as it gets dark. Thanks for listening to me, too.  I know this time of year is stressful for all of us - getting to and past the dx of 2 years ago is hard.  I see the gyn on Monday, dentist on Wed and onc in a few weeks.  I guess I can look at as preventive maintenance (can you tell I worked in a manufacturing plant?) or early spring cleaning. Hugs to all  - Julie",

I said that breast cancer sucks, Alzheimer's sucks.  My aunt passed away last week after having hospice come in the week before.  It just isn't fair - all of this! Anyone up for a root canal today?  I had my gyn appointment last week and all is well.  Next day time for 6 month dental checkup, but was having pain.  Abscessed tooth - thanks chemo - the gift that ruins your teeth long after you are done!  I had to be on antibiotics to clear up the infection and pain pills because the sucker hurt.  I swear child birth wasn't this bad. Or you can stay at my house with my sick DH and puking DD.  Yesterday was a snow day due to low wind chills and blowing snow.  We were even lucky enough to know the night before which rarely happens.  Everyone was excited because the backward jammies and spoons under pillows seemed to work this time.  Yesterday morning before 6:00 am, dd comes in our room and says she just puked 5x by her bed.  Nothing like having the \"snow\" day change to \"laundry\" and \"carpet cleaning\" day earlier that a normal day.  She threw up until the afternoon and is just wiped out and sore.  She's up but not too perky today, but she is feeling better.  I just know someone knows we've been working on our taxes and thinks this would be a good time for new carpet in the girls' rooms.  Any ideas on how to keep mental notes to myself? Rock, Angels, Jen and all other photographers - keep the winter pictures coming.  Somehow you make all of the white stuff appealing. I'll try to get back this afternoon, but my mouth will be numb so I don't know if I will be able to type.  Think about that one for a while. Love you all - Julie",

I can't get my act together, still.  Went to PCP this week and switched some meds around. I say that everything in our lives has a \"To Be Continued\" sign on it.  I have taxes to do, which involves adding up our medical expenses to see if we have enough to claim, which involved putting all of last year's receipts in order so I can work with them.  Nothing is just one simple step.  There are multiple layers (piles) and I just get overwhelmed and don't do anything. Kristy - how was your mammogram?  I did fine with my bloodwork.  I alway just sit down and put out my arm and say here is the one vein that works. My dh is still trying to get healthy.  He saw the PCP on Monday who wants him checked out be cardiologist, just to be on the safe side.  Saw card today and DH has an abnormal EKG which didn't show up last week in ER.  He is scheduled for a stress test next week.  Still can't go back to work until he is cleared by everyone.  Did I mention that I am ready for him to go back to work?  Now he has been out of work long enough to have to be on STD. Meanwhile, I'm expecting a call from younger dd's teacher.  She worked on a book report for over a week and I read some of it after she finished.  OMG it was more like a book review.  I can't even imagine what kind of grade she might get.  Here is her paragraph about the purpose of the book.  The book was \"The Hunger Games\".  Rock, I know you are stressed, but please help me here. LOL \"Like I said before, I really don't think there is a purpose other than murdering people and entertaining. It is as simple as that.  Everyone has their own opinion even though this really isn't an opinion.  Off topic!  For the last time, only for entertaining.\" Anyone?  A little help?  She is in 5th grade.

My girls, too.  My husband is still earning her trust.  Makes me think she was abused by a man somewhere in her past.  Both girls said they will help so we will see how that goes.  We have spring break next week so we have more time to get familiar. Cris- been thinking about you and praying for you and your family.  I'm so glad you might be finding a house soon.  That will be a positive change. I don't have any advice for the itchy head and wig.  My answer was: take wig off and place back on styrofoam stand (decorated by my daughters), turn stand around so eyes can't follow you around the room and put on a bandana. Robin -  your cruise sounds wonderful.  Heck, I've never had a red bra (pre or post BC).  I'll sit nicely by Otter and Kerry in your suitcase.  We aren't big travelers so I love going with all of you. Otter - my v v prescription is on its way to you.  Use it anyway you want to.  Share it with all you think need it.  You have so much going on, I'm sure someone else could use a dose. My SIL is in town this week because her mom had a hip replaced last week.  She is going through similar situations.  Her parents are so stubborn and not real cooperative.

Saturday our scouts participated in Earth Day activities at our local nature center. Today we met with a genetic counselor to discuss the brca testing.  My mom met with her a few weeks ago and wasn't able to do the test because of insurance.  They did the blood work today and I should know something in 2-3 weeks.  If positive, the first thing recommended was an ooph.  I just can't get ahead of myself.

Kind of like the story \"There was an old lady who swallowed a fly\".  I didn't feel my lump.  I went for a gyn appt because I was just few years behind on the check ups and my 93 yo grandmother found out she had bc.  No one else felt my lump, either. It showed on the mammogram. I found out the day before my grandma died that I needed to have a biopsy.  Her birthday was January 31 so there are reminders of her and of my ordeal just about month. But, as you've all said, we are here to start this new year.  My hair is on its way back with a lot of gray and curls and could pass as an intended style.  I say it is the most expensive perm I've ever had (around $60,000 for chemo) and I have ONE tan boob that cost about the same.  I'm still trying to keep a sense of humor and enjoy the funny quips I've read here. Weather in central Illinois today - high of 0 with wind chill of -15 to -30 and kids were home - just when I had gotten used to them being back on schedule.

Jen - I like the 3 amigo thing.  Aren't there about 18 of us still on here?  We can be the 18 FU's and I like the sombrero idea. We can still bring our shovels along when we go take care of RanD's cancer cells. We saw one of Riley's teachers when we went to Cracker Barrel after the open house.  The doctor listed the reason for missing school as a \"contusion\" (of her foot) since we hadn't done xrays yet.  He listed the same thing for not participating in PE. She had bumped her head once at school and once at home so I think the teachers thought the contusion was on her head.  We seem to have had some \"contusion confusion\".  Sorry, couldn't resist.  Now we will all be singing Conjunction Junction with a medical theme.  So I think it is all straightened out - for now - no more PE this week and next week they start two weeks of standardized tests (don't get me started on that topic) so PE gets pushed aside.  Riley probably told the teacher about the bump on her head which she called a \"concoction\" instead of a concussion which she didn't even have. Jen - what kind of play is your son in?  That is always so fun.  We have a piano performance (Riley) and informal piano recital (Katie) coming up in the next few weeks. I'm lucky that my regular digital camera can record video and works out perfectly for the short little songs. We saw a robin today and are having thunderstorms right now going back to snow over the weekend.  Jean - did you end up with much snow? Noelle - tell us about your juice. Good night ladies, Julie ",

Cris - sorry to hear about the loss of your bird.  That is so hard for the little ones.  I hope you can make a decision about your job.  I left my job in Sept 07 because I had enough of pretty much everything.  I had been there 2 months short of 20 years and I was just so stressed out.  I hadn't taken much time off to be with my girls except the maternity leave and I was going to be a stay at home mom, even though they didn't stay home anymore.  Then In January 08 I started all of this mess.  Now I'm done with my treatment, but just don't know if I can go back anywhere.  I love being able to get them going in the morning and to just be available for them.  My little one (she's actually 10) was sick at school last week and when the school called I was able be there in about 10 minutes.  Do you have something else that you are looking into?  I know you will make the right decision for you and your family.  I keep reading how stress can cause cancer and you do stop and go back to what you were doing before.  I know of at least one other woman who worked at my company who was diagnosed about the same time. Gracie - be careful out there in the ice.  How much did you have?  We had about 8\" of snow and the kids were home - again - yesterday.  You asked about hair.  My last chemo was July 29 and I stopped wearing my bandanas and hats October 1.  I said I looked like a sock monkey.  After that it really took off and looks like I planned it this way.  It finally started getting curly and I don't mind it at all.  I had a girl scout meeting last week and my hair was all the rave.  I haven't cut or colored it yet - not sure how either of those would work.  I have this gray spot right in front that everyone keeps telling me how people pay good money to have highlights like that.  Me too - chemo was about $60,000 - the most expensive perm I've ever had.  Just be patient, it will come back! Noelle - can we go back and talk about exfoliation again?  I have little white bumps on the palm of my right hand which only show up when my hands have been wet for awhile (shower or dishes).  They don't itch or hurt.  Has anyone seen this?  I'm trying to decide if it could be some residual SE from chemo or if it is just related to winter.  Back to exfoliation - is it okay to use those products on your hands?  Thanks for the info.  I'd be glad to order something from you to try. Best wishes to everyone going to or waitng for treatment, results, etc. today.  I go see they gyn tomorrow.  Hope she can help get me back on track.  I don't feel like doing anything these days.  Again, don't know if it is weather related or this is just the new normal.

Roxi - how was your birthday?  Did you have a nice evening out? Rock - would be glad to help you decorate.  Just give me a brush with any color of paint that you'd like. RanD - glad that you are able to put some normal activities into your day.  It sounds rough, but we know you can do it and we will be with you all the way! Noelle - thanks for the advice.  I just need to have the 13 year old do the dishes! Sue - I'm so excited for your retirement.  You've worked hard for that.  When is your last day? I wouldn't do well at Survivor, but wouldn't mind going somewhere warm.  Everyone have a nice weekend! Julie",

It's been quiet on here today.  Hope everyone is doing okay. RanD - hope you had a weekend of love and pampering with your family. Cris - you are such the proud momma.  That is so exciting when your good accomplish something they've been working hard at.  I tried to get my 13-yo to go out for 7th grade track.  Not interested.  My 10-yo is opting out of anything she gets the chance to.  Sometimes I wish the teachers didn't give them choices. It's a young author program and we are trying to change her mind for her.  All of the other years, it hasn't been an option.  She is a very creative person and would be good at this.  My 13 year old is a Katie and I'm just using the excuse that she is 13 for everything.  My 10 year old is Riley and I use the whole birth order thing to explain her. Jen - painting sounds like fun.  We painted Katie's room a medium purple color a few years ago by ourselves.  I'd like to paint one wall in my bedroom a deep plum/eggplant color but can't get the buy in or help from dh. Rock - your party sounds fun.  Somehow I just imagine that any party you throw is fun and interesting no matter what you serve. Kristy - did you survive the weekend with the meals and helping at concession stands?  We aren't quite that involved in things yet.  I could have helped at above mentioned chili supper, but am still kind of tired and those things wipe me out. I did have my follow up appointment last Thursday and I'm good for another 3 months.  So I'll have a mammo that will be a 6 month one.  I'm feeling a little better about everything.  My CA 27.29 (thanks Otter for your helpful info) came back low so I feel good about that, too. Hope everyone else is having a non-sucky week and that it is warming up wherever it needs to. Kerry - thanks for the cultural and geography lessons.  I feel like I'm back in school - in a good way. Angels - 10 days to Disney!  That sounds like fun.  How long will you be gone?  My husband is trying to get his time off arranged for Myrtle Beach in May.  I'm getting excited.  I think everyone here put their regular life and plans on hold all last year.  My girls didn't understand why we didn't take a big vacation.  They did stuff, just not always with all of us, or we did little trips in the area.  It will be good to get away.

Kristy - I wish you could have explained to your tech what this group is capable of.  We sounded very fierce when I read your description.  They seem to always have to prove that they know better than us.  And we usually prove them wrong! I went to my PCP this week to re-up my Ativan prescription so I can sleep.  My onc won't give it to me since I only see him for follow ups.  My dr was reluctant at first, explaining that it is like Xanax, blah, blah, blah.  Heck, that's why I want it.  I have been trying to take half the dosage but that isn't enough to put me out.  Before bc I was pre-diabetic and watched what I ate, pricked my finger every morning, etc.  I told him I had given up on all of that while on chemo.  I told him I mostly just ate ramen noodles and canned peaches.  He told my husband that at least I was a cheap date.  I said yes, until you take into account the $60,000 perm and the $60,000 boob job.  I had to go to the hospital to do the glucose tolerance testing.  I hate that.  Nothing like starting your day starving and your first food is \"fruit punch\".  If you throw up, the test is null and void.  Had the thryroid checked, also.  I called today and everything is fine.  I couldn't believe there isn't something more I need to do because that's how all of the appointments were this last year. Gracie - I admire you for the calmness you have about your surgery.  I know you put a lot of thought into it and I'm glad you reached a good decision for you.  Loved learning more about your family and your brother.  We'll take stories anytime.  My brother is 5.5 years younger.  I wanted a dog, but got a brother and bike instead.  You always try to protect them.  Last year was crazy.  He was in Afghanistan at the time my grandmother passed away and didn't get to make it to her funeral.  Then three weeks later we found out about the bc.  All this going on at home while he was trying to get out of there.  We didn't want him to be stressed about his work and about us. Cris - was the mammo today or is it tomorrow?  Maybe you should use Kristy's notes about what will happen if they hurt you.  You \"have\" friends. Linda - hoping you get good news soon.  You amaze me with your athletic feats.  I'm so impressed with all of you (Jean, Noelle) who were able to maintain your physical activities during your tx.  I'm supposed to start walking with my mom tomorrow at 8:00 am.  I guess I have to start somewhere.  Need to be beach ready by June. Kerry - you have such a way with words and animal sounds.  The passage that Noelle noted at the top of the page is beautiful about the joys in life.  That was so touching and brings one to tears and then at the bottom of the page you brought tears of a different kind.  You are good, my dear. Noelle - I've been singing \"Rainbow Connection\" all day.  It's stuck in my mind.  Hope you have a productive, but not too crazy day tomorrow. RanD - of course you are going to get through this and be stronger than ever.  You can't keep a good woman down.  Are you juicing something to get your green food or are you taking something else?  Just curious. Jen - woo hoo for good samaritans. You don't find a lot of people that want to get involved these days.  We were at our mall at Christmas and a young woman had passed out, got up and some other people were trying to help her and then she fell down again.  My husband stepped in and told them not to move her because she had bumped her head.  He was very calm about the whole situation  Those things scare me, but I know I could help if I need to. Adrienne - you and your husband are so talented.  The napkin artwork is great.  I'm still trying to figure out where I fit in now that I'm done with my tx.  It seems that the only things in the area are the relay for life teams.  Not sure how I feel about that.  My daughter and I are getting ready to start the bags for bc patients at our cancer center.  I think we'll call them Katie's Chemo Kits. Karin - any leftovers at your house?  Dinner sounded yummy.  My parents were at my grandpa's in Kentucky today and they stopped and brought home barbeque.  That was my dinner and too bad my kids don't like it so I will have more for lunch tomorrow.  Congrats on the new position and freeing up the bathroom time with your hubby. Otter - I have a facebook account - just not sure what to do next  Will all of you be my friends? Roxi - are you packing yet? Sue - you've almost made it through another week.  Are they going by fast yet?  How many days are left? Rock - my daughter was so excited to know that our card got to you.  We've never sent anything as far or to as many places as we did that day. I love having 18-19 sisters and we all get along so well.  That is something truly special and thank God every day for bringing all of you into my life.  Enjoy Friday everyone! Julie",

Are there any agencies that could help with the utilities, any subsidized housing?  I'm sure you have already been through those ideas.

Adrienne - I love how you now use your rock for the Familyroks avitar.  That is clever. Kristy -  I'm glad your daughter has the opportunity to go to Italy.  That sounds fun.  Will you please share your squash recipe? Roxi - glad you got a good review and can drive again. That always made me feel more normal - when I could do some of the basic things myself. Noelle -  how is your ear?  Sounds lik you had a fun weekend.  It's good to get away! We're off to Fayetteville, NC tomorrow.  There is plenty of room for everyone in the back of the van.  We brought our Gumby along and have been taking pictures of him with the different state signs.  Kind of like \"may you never gnome alone\". Traveling with my family - today is a good day. Later ladies - Julie Otter -  speaking of crazy journeys - I'm getting a crazy visual image, too.  Thanks for sharing what could have been really embarrasing.",

Bragg.  He has been on a temporary assignment in Washington DC since Feb and his return time keeps getting postponed.  He should get back the Monday before we all show up on Friday and go to SC on Saturday.  My SIL made a comment on FB about trying to get ready for houseguests, trying to get stuff done without my brother there blah, blah, blah.  I sent her an email saying we would be glad to stay at a hotel if that would help and we would be glad to do whatever shopping needed to be done so she wouldn't have to.  She didn't want us to do that and the whole beach thing was her idea (remember we are going to celebrate completing MY treatment last year) but now she would like to have some time with my brother and not all 9 of us being together all of the time.  So even if you get invited, you aren't always made to feel welcome.  We are breaking the trip up into 3 days, each about 5 hours of driving.  We went to Gatlinburg two years ago and after we got home I ended up in the ER because I couldn't move.  All of the driving killed my back.  I don't want that so we are doing shorter legs of the trip.  Today my mom asked if I thought I would be up for all of this.  I should have said no, but everyone had to make the plans last year before I even started radiation.  I like to sleep in, what can I say?  She suggested that I try to wean myself from the sleeping or the trip might not be fun.  Yes, I still get tired when I shop or do anything for a long time.  They just don't seem to get it and no this probably isn't the celebratory vacation I would have picked.  My brother is going to give my mom a \"suggested itinerary\" just to give her something to focus on or she will be going crazy not know what we are doing. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to rant.  My children are very excited about going to the ocean.  We've only been one other time and it was to Gulf Shores about 8 years ago.  We may just distance ourselves and do what we want to do. Roxi - so glad your surgery went well.  I can't imagine being under for so long.  You all are so brave who venture back under the knife.  I'm so proud of you, too. RanD - it is so nice to hear from you.  Just come here whenever YOU want - no pressure from us.  We are always with you.  I wish I was closer so that I could really help. Linda - great job at the race.  The important thing is, your body did make it through the race despite all it has been through.  I hope your foot settles down. Angels - happy camper shopping.  That sounds like fun.  I loved Otter's advice.  Almost had me buying one. I hope everyone else is having a lovely weekend.  Hugs to you all - Julie",

Yes, the girls are going to camp.  Riley is going to a 4H camp.  I went there 5 different times when I was that age.  It should be fun and she isn't concerned about being away from home for a week.  She'll write to me, she said.  Katie is going to band camp for middle schoolers at the local university.  She will go ahead and stay on campus.  They get to stay in the residence halls and start their practices at 8:30 am.  This should be a good experience for her.  They finish the week by giving a concert.  She's been away from home for that long, but not to any kind of camps.  But she is familiar with the campus and will be working in the same building where she takes piano lessons.  That gives her a little advanatage in the confidence area.  They aren't gone the same week, but back to back so July will be fairly quiet. Today is our 26th wedding anniversary.  My dh went all out and got me the best - a 2010 Rand McNally atlas.  Who could ask for more? Adrienne -  no black nail polish and a new atlas - today is a good day.  I'm trying to make that a part of my day.

Katie likes the chalk-in competition, but you can't draw on wet pavement.  Last year her bc ribbon got her 3rd place in her age category. I'm still willing to send whatever you need for Randie.  Can we find some of her \"isms\" by just looking at her posts here?  Her profile would have all of them from all the threads that she went to. Rock -  I know you said you talked to her family.  Was it a peaceful death?  I've been so bothered by it.  But then again, you wouldn't want her just giving up. My family needs your prayers.  My aunt had her surgery on Tuesday.  They removed about a foot of her colon and the tumor was the size of a tennis ball.  13 out 26 nodes were positive so they are staging her as a \"D\" on the Duke scale.  I haven't looked it up yet.  They do think she has some spots on her lungs.  She is supposed to go home today and will meet with oncs next week.  I know we aren't statistics, but the prognosis for that stage isn't very good. She is only 65 and wasn't having any kind of symptoms for either colon or lung problems.  Her doctor told her she has colon cancer but she isn't dying from colong cancer. That makes me feel a little better. Anyway her name is Carol and she is in the Cleveland area. Thanks so much. Love to you all - Julie",

I'm so glad everyone is getting good results from tests.  That is so great! Have a nice Friday! Julie",

Lovely day here again.  It is only supposed to get to the lower 70's.  We went to a bonfire last night and it seemed like a fall night.  Bonfires in July are not normal. Older dd is home from band camp and had a great time.  They gave a concert at the end yesterday and you really have to give the directors credit for taking 70 some kids from all over and helping them make beautiful music. Update on my grandpa - he had his gall bladder removed on Wednesday and is doing okay.  Had a tough couple of nights getting the anesthesia out of his system.  Was very combative and tried to get out of bed over 40 times one night.  The next morning it took 4 people to try to restrain him and keep him in bed.  Remember - he is 94 years old.  They weren't able to do the procedure laproscopically so it will take more time in the hospital before he can go home, but overall is doing well.  My mom is still there and the different siblings have been in and out staying with him. Karin - I love how you described the spirit of Randie.  I think we all need to slow down, quiet down and look for those inspiring moments. Hugs to all - Julie",

I don't have much experience with AD.  I have an aunt who has gone downhill quickly and the family is working with hospice.  They live in Little Rock so I don't know the daily in's and out's of her treatment.  So . . . I will send more hugs your way.  Please call if you ever need to.  I'm always around. Love ya - Julie",

Ooh, I can think of lots of places to use the \"just deal with it and move on\" motto.  Can I start with my SIL?  I almost can't stand to read her posts on FB.  Good news - my brother had his 1st colonscopy yesterday and they only removed 1 small polyp.  He is good for another 5 years.  He said they turned on the disco ball and started playing Supertramp's Take the Long Way Home.  Isn't that funny and somehow totally appropriate for that procedure?  Or maybe I'm just warped.  I thought you all would get a kick out of that. Noelle - I'm sorry about your little kitty.  That is sad.  I know you can't replace him wih another, but something will come into your life to help.  Just like he came into your life last year to help you.  I don't have any pet stories.  I'm allergic to cats.  We had them when I was a child until we found out they were the cause of my sicknesses and we had to give one away.  I don't really remember. Cris - sorry about sick kids and waiting for sheets.  That stinks.  Hope she is feeling better soon and hope you get over the root canal issue.  My root canal was more traumatic than having kids. Hey Otter - where are you pioneering to today?  Love seeing your pictures on FB. Robin - sounds like you are having a nice visit with your nephew.  Sometimes we just need to explore our own backyard.  We spent the night with an aunt and uncle in TN on our way home last month and picked up one of those tourist pamphlets about their town at a rest stop.  There were things on there that they didn't know and they have lived there for a long time. Kerry - I'm not really ready for fall yet, but it is nice hearing you talk about it and the full moon the other night.  It seems so strange that we are all over the world, yet we all see the same moon and it was full.  I know Rock asked questions about that.  We will always have something in common. Eddie - how are you surviving your trip?  I bet you are having a blast. Gracie - glad to hear that you are a good kind of D.A.T. and you were ready to be back to work.  I think I need to find a new purpose in life, just not sure what it is yet. Jen - enjoy the day today and you, too, Karin.  Sounds like you had a good day yesterday. Angels - how is your summer at your cabin?  That still sounds so peaceful. Kristy - are you on vacation yet?  If so, have a great time. Linda - loved your vacation pix on FB.  It is so nice to be able to tag along with everyone through the eyes of your cameras and the your hearts and souls. Randie - I'll just say - Hello to you in Heaven.  Hoping your family is at peach. I love all of you  - Julie My mom just called and said my 94-yo grandpa went to the ER.  They are probably going down there.  Need positive thoughts and prayers which I know you all or so good at.  I appreciate them, I really do.",

Sorry to everyone with dental issues.  I've only recently been able to deal with procedures without being put out.  I don't even like to go to the office to take the girls.  My dentist always comments on the progress of my hair and is amazed by the curls.  He can relate a little more now because his MIL was recently diagnosed and he was asking me questions.  The whole last year flashed before my eyes. Roxi - how is your infection?  I hope you are healing nicely.  I also sent a card directly to Randie's family and will send a special one for Eddie to send.  Just tryint to think of the right thing to say. Angels - I can't even imagine having to make the arrangements for your mom.  I hope all goes well so you can enjoy your camping. Otter - thanks for buffalo roaming card.  My daughter was surprised by the number on the card because she thought they were endangered. Kerry - sounds like your weather is crazy.  Do you typically get snow in the winter.  Sorry, I'm not up on my geography these days.  The weather is great here and one dd is at band camp so the house is fairly quiet after all.  I talked to her today and she is having a busy time, but good and dorm food is better than her middle school food. Cris - glad your dd is better.  My niece was like that.  My brother would have to lay on her floor at night while she fell asleep and then low crawl (military term) out of the room so she wouldn't wake up or she would throw a fit and be sick several times a night.  That has to get old fast. Jackie - hope you enjoyed your day and the space invaders let you have your own space. Rock - you do deserve someone better than your former crush.  Too bad he didn't get a chance to know you like we do.  He's missing out on a great woman. Hugs to all - Julie",

Taking youngest dd and 2 friends to our library for a program with a cartoonist.  They will actually get to draw.  Sounds like fun.  Then she is off to see Harry Potter.  My older dd will be jealous.  She is at band camp until Saturday so she missed all of the midnight showings that her friends went to.  She has called me several times.  She loves me, right?  Or is she just so bored because there isn't any TV, computers, games, etc. during their down time? Yea Noelle - one more treatment.  That is great!  Glad you got to go to HP last night.  Did you have fun? Kerry - sorry about your dental woes.  My dentist provides sunglasses for protection, maybe ear plugs should be next.  I can always hear what is going on \"behind the big door\" to the back and wonder about the poor souls back there.  Usually it is nothing, but it sounds terrible.  I think that is what I hate most.  Even when they clean my teeth and it doesn't hurt. Kristy - are you packed?  Have fun! Randie - missing your summer antics. Hugs to all - Julie",

Dana - so glad to see your post.  I, too, was excited when I saw it.  Sending cyber hugs from Illinois to you.  I'm sorry you are having a rough time with chemo and that it is making your summer difficult.  Just post when you feel like it.  We are always here for you.  Give me a call if you ever need to talk. Not much going on here.  Starting clothes shopping for back to school.  My 13 yo and I didn't have any difficulties buying jeans.  I'm so surprised.  I'm not real thrilled with the choices out there, but we found some that cover her up - mostly.  Younger one is growing so fast that I hate to think about buying much for her now.  The grosberg (that's what she thought a growth spurt was a few years ago) just ins't stopping.  I bet she has grown 2\" just this summer.  Got to get her in basketball. I'm happy for all who are working what they want to work and all who are traveling. Otter - love hearing about your travels and seeing your pics on FB.   My dh is putting in a lot of OT at his place.  I'm just glad I can be home with the girls and handle all of their needs for once.  I'm so happy doing this.  I've never had a summer with them until last summer and we all know what that summer was like.  I'm not even that ready for them to go back to school like most parents. I feel bad for all of you sweltering in the heat.  Our weather has been so pleasant - not typical of July in Illinois.  It will probably all break loose in 2 weeks when the kids go back to school.  The schools are air conditioned so they won't dismiss early like they did when we were kids. We went to the county fair this week and it was the first time I can remember that I wasn't completely sweat soaked by the time we got home.  They have an arm band night.  Pay $20 and ride anything as much as you want.  It paid off by about the 3rd ride.  Also enjoyed a very greasy corn dog, vinegar fries and a lemon shake up.  You just don't get any better than fair food. Randie - thinking about you and your family everyday - and everyone else here. Have a lovely weekend ladies! Love ya - Julie",

Jen - I'm so glad you are doing okay.  I've had a lot of morning headaches lately.  I finally went to the chiropracter and that seemed to help.  Our allergy season is so crazy lately.  Everyone is sneezing or stuffed up - worse than usual. Angels - I admire your strength in dealing with your mom.  That has to be hard, but it sounds like you are doing everything right to make things good for her.  Where are you cruising to?  Can we come along? Eddie - the package has to turn up somewhere, sometime.  We'll keep our fingers crossed. Otter - glad to know you are home and posting more.  Sounds like your summer was great! It also sounds like we are all back in the doctor/scan/appointment business again.  It's amazin how fast those dates roll back around.  I go see the onc this afternoon.  Had a chest x-ray and blood work done on Tuesday to prepare.  I think I was more concerned about not touching anything and picking up any flu germs than anything else.  Today I'm a little more worried, which I guess is normal.  When I called to change my appointment the cancer center person said the doctor I started seeing for my check ups is no longer with the hospital - as of last Friday and I will be seeing a new doctor so-and-so.  When I went to register for my tests, the clerk didn't even know about the personnel change.  Glad I could give them useful information.  LOL!  She said she wasn't surprised.  The doctor that left wasn't the most warm and fuzzy kind of guy.  He seemed more interested in his processes and procedures than the people.  The clerk said they several cancer patients had left because of him.  So we will see what this new guy is like today.  So this will be my 3rd medical onc.  I saw the old \"new\" guy last year during his first week and now I'm seeing this guy in his new week.  Anything can happen.  The original doctor is great and it will be hard to fill his position.  He took another position in the hospital, but was highly regarded by all. Noelle - congrats on the triathlon!  You amaze me.  I do a triathlon everyday: laundry, dishes, cooking - and feel like I ought to win an award or something. Kerry - I just love reading anything you write.  Love you attitude on life. Kids have been back in school and are already finishing up the 4th week.  Cris, I can't believe September is almost half over already.  The oboe arrives in about a week.  Wish us luck with that.  Youngest DD had her mind set on that and the band director will let her try.  One of my other dd's friends plays an oboe and her advice to Riley was to change instruments as soon as possible.  This will be interesting. Have a great day, ladies.  I'll come back later after I've been to the onc - of course you all will know what is going on because I'm taking you with me. Hugs to all - Julie ",

It rolled around quickly this week.  My appointment Friday was fine.  I just wish when you see a new doctor that he would at least introduce himself and ask who we are.  I know he knows who I am because he has my file in front of him, but didn't want to know who my dh was.  I feel more sorry for the staff at the cancer center because this is their 2nd new doc in under a year and they are having to adjust again.  This doc said I should still be on the every 3 month appointments, not 4 months.  I'm already scheduled for a mammogram and visit with the radiation onc in November and then it would be December so I get to do everything in November and get back on track for every 3 months.  Maybe that's why the one guy is gone.  Everything is fine and he quizzed me to see if I knew how to do my self exam.  That was a little humbling.  This guy is only temporary so I may be seeing someone different by the time November gets here.  We talked about whether I needed to do the BRCA testing and he didn't think there is enough direct links in my family history for now.  I still have mixed emotions since I have 2 girls. Cris - the oboe arrives next week so we will see.  I love clarinecks.  That's good.  I think Riley just didn't want to be the average flute and clarinet player which is where most of the girls end up, but that is just her. Gracie - I've kind of gone away from Farmtown and now I play gem swap - still addicting.  I tell my husband I've been \"busy\" all day which doesn't necessarily mean \"productive\".  There is a difference. I'm sorry everyone is experiencing se's from the different meds.  I know it would be so nice not to be reminded of this every day by the current things. Jen - glad you are feeling better and the headaches are ONLY from seasonal allergies.  Those can be nasty.  We are all sneezy here.  My dh went to work this morning and came home a few hours later.  I may have to spray him down with Lysol or something.  He has stomach issues and a headache.  He might have picked up something at the hospital on Friday.  He got a drink for me from a vending machine in the ER waiting area.  Now that sound like a breeding ground for who knows what.

The oboe arrived yesterday, but she is only allowed to play the reed so far.  I still have time to get some ear plugs.  We have a progressive dinner for piano tomorrow night and that sounds interesting.  We start out at an adult living facility for the salad and the kids play several songs.  We will go somewhere else for the main course with more songs and to another house for dessert and more songs.  I am making a pineapple sheet cake which sounds yummy right now. Also deep into girl scout registrations.  It's almost cookie season so it is crazy right now. Jean - go for it.  I love Ellen. I hope everyone has a happy week! Hugs to all - Julie",

Robin -  I so admire you for going back to school and for doing so well with your first course.  You go, girl! We had parent teacher conferences this week and both girls did great the first quarter.  My Riley was labeled as \"shy\" and \"quiet\" by her teacher.  I had to look at the papers to make sure we were discussing the right student.  Katie is a delight to have in class.  It makes me feel so good to hear nice things about them and to know that they received good grades at the same time.  Katie will probably be able to take Honors English next year when she gets to High School. It's crazy here.  We're trying to finalize the Halloween costumes for next weekend then we have 2 weekends of birthdays and parties.  Not ready for those yet. I'm so happy to hear about walking, mowers, feeling good, spring, melty snow, warm weather, trips away from home and uneventful house cleanings. I may not post a lot, but read and think of you all every day.  I go around the world with my thoughts.  I have a little map in my head and know where you all are.  Perfect little map push pins that string us all together.

I was a good girl and didn't get out the tape once (was tempted, though).  MIL knows everything and you can't convince her otherwise.  She knows everything, but she doesn't know this!  I told them that this is handled completely differently than most other medical situations/procedures that they have dealt with.  FIL wants to have this taken care of NOW!  Wanted to see if he could just be admitted to the hospital to have all of the tests done and stay for surgery.  We've tried to tell him that he will have to \"work\" to make everything happen and things are moving along quickly.  He saw both doctors and had a PET scan all within 10 days of the initial diagnosis.  I think we all could have lived with that timeline.  MIL is upset that there is no \"definitive\" doctor in charge of everything.  I tried to reiterate that this is a team approach and different medical professionals will move in and out of the picture as needed.  I'm not being nasty, but am trying to be fairly forceful with my opinions.  I would never just let them sink, which they would have done yesterday, if I wasn't there taking notes.  MIL wants FIL to learn to do some of these things himself (like ask for copies of path reports) and was trying to signal to me with her eyes to have him do it.  I told her it didn't matter who asks, just that it gets done!  This doesn't have to be that kind of a life learning lesson.  My DH took them for the PET scan today and was just trying to get the point across that it isn't about her, even though that is how she is acting. Thanks for letting me vent.  It's bad enough that my FIL has to go through this, but all of this other crap just wears me out. Then (my funny for the day) I found out that a 5th grade boy \"asked out\" my 5th grade daughter!  She said no.  He is a troublesome child and his name is mentioned every time bad behaviour is mentioned. Just when I thought I understood girls. . . Have I told you lately that I love all of you?  I do! Hugs to all - Julie",

Adrienne and Linda - let me tell you my menopause / not menopause story.  I went 54 weeks without a period and then it came back as the worst one I had ever had in my life.  I had bloodwork done back in January and was told that the estrogen was done and the other stuff was done.  I, like you, went into a panic thinking what was I going to have to \"do\" this year.  I went for more blood work in July and that pesky old estrogen was back!  So much for my chemo bonus.  Onc said that since I am at the age (47 now) where my body could start leading me to menopause, my body recovered.  However . . .  I only had one other period in August and it was normal. I've had the slight spotting ocassionally since then.  I don't know what to expect anymore.  You think you can put things behind you (no pun there, Jen) and you can't because you are still thinking about it. Feel free to vent anytime. Rock - glad you are back on our soil and that you invited us all along for a great year-long trip! Hurray for all with warm weather.  We are expecting our coldest over New Year's and when the kids go back to school. Hugs to all - Julie",

They've only been playing for 4 months and they sound better than (don't tell my other daughter) the Middle School band.  The director is great and does a fantastic job with the kids.  I have to give her a lot of credit because this year she is teaching my stubborn one.  The chili was good and it was just a fun night.  I love the chance to catch up with other parents that you only see at these events.  Our school district is in the same boat as so many others - they are trying to cut $1.54 million from the budget.  Everyone/everything is being looked at.  Our classes are already full and the teachers are stressed out so the situation may get bad.  We hope the music programs aren't involved.  The superintendent of schools was there.  I hope he saw that the gym was filled to the brim with people who support the arts at this early age. Cris - we support you with your \"stuff\".  Just let us know what we can do to help.  In the mean time, hugs are on the way.  And with the reading logs - we do that, too.  Your daughter's entry sounds just like Riley's.  Every week the teacher tells her to tell how she feels about what is happening, what she thinks will happen, etc and every week . . . Kristy - is it too late to bid on your cake?  Whoever won was one lucky person to get a completely homemade cake.  How much did it go for?  I love hearing about the activities of the kids. Kerry - I love your button story.  I can so relate.  I probably would have just thrown the button out at some point.  I was somewhat like this pre-bc, but I had reasons.  I worked, had 2 kids and grand expectations.  Now I have excuses, but I am trying to get it together.  Maybe we all can put together a plan that includes Otter's Virtual Valium along with Eddie's chocolate prescription and a dash of Randie's wit. Eddie - your sons' activities amaze me.  They are both so talented.  I'm trying to find that same balance and it is hard.  I think part is because I worked almost 20 years when I left my job.  I only had a few months off before all of this came along so I hadn't established a new \"no job\" normal.  Then it was time to be abnormal and then another new normal.  That's just too many. I hope everyone has a great week.  Kerry - I'm so glad you like fall now.  It's always been one of my favorite seasons.  We have a few buds on our lilac bushes so spring has to be getting closer. Eddie, I see my onc tomorrow, too.  I'm not expecting anything, but you never know.  I'll come with you, if you come with me.  We saw the rad onc at the chili supper last night.  That is the only way I want to see them - out in public having a fun time with families.

Rock - I'm so glad you have nice weather - too bad about the shellacked (sp) hair.  Did you see where our governor - Blagojevich (another one with shellacked hair) was impeached last week?  I know, kind of off the subject.  We had a little more snow over night and it got cold again.  But we saw a rainbow on the way to school today.  My 10-yr old asked if it is a \"snowbow\" since it didn't rain.  That's my happy thing for the day.  I like to look back at the posts to see how much we have overcome in a year and things aren't really that bad relatively speaking.

Noelle - you should do the website.  I'll mark it as a \"favorite\" - just like everyone here.  I plan to use shampoo today and then give your method a try over the weekend.  You always have the best tips. Kerry - it was nice to hear from you again and loved your description of the hot flashes.  You certainly have a way with words! Jean - inspired by your running.  My problem is that I don't like to get sweaty.  I have large breasts and don't like the bouncy business especially since radiation.  I did find a DVD from Binney's LE thread and I've done it a few times.  I'm thinking about getting moving which is the most I've done so far. I got my blood work results back yesterday.  Officially in menopause - no more periods! Woo Hoo.  Chemo sucked, but if it stopped the periods then that was a bonus, along with the curls.  Every day I'm finding I got more for my money than I realizes.  I also have a Vitamin D deficiency and she prescribed 50,000 iu 2x a week for 8 weeks to jump start my system.  Does anyone have any experience with that? Roxi - glad you got to chat with your onc.  When is your biopsy?  You can always call one of us to talk if you need to.  Jen - enjoy the new bedroom.  It sounds so nice and cozy.  It seems we always put ourselves last.  We have the bedroom furniture that my parent used when they first got married.  It looks retro now with the angles on the handles and the laminate wood.  But it still holds what we need it to and no one is in there but us, so maybe someday ...

RanD - we will support any decision you make.  Eddie, Rock and Otter all seem to be on the same page and their reasoning makes sense.  You just have to do what is right for you and your family.  If you ever need to talk anything over, just give me a call.  I admire the spirit and spunk in your posts.  You describe the terrible things that have happened and then turn around in the next paragraph and you are off to fight this or do normal activities.  That takes a special person and you are.  Is your family still there with you.  Are they weighing in on your decision? Eddie - glad you got away to ski.  We've never done that before.  I'm sorry you aren't feeling well.  We will be there to hold your hand when you see the doctor.  I'm the one on a high amount of Vitamin D.  I'm taking 50,000 iu 2x a week for 8 weeks, then she wants me to take 1000-2000 daily. Okay, naive Julie here has chooks questions.  Do you raise them just for the eggs or the meat, too?  Do you sell the eggs or are they for your own family use?  Just curious.  Yes, I live in central Illinois which is a rural area, but I'm not a farm girl plus it is just fascinating to know what everyone is involved in.  My daughter Katie loves to hear about where everyone is from.  Sending the Valentin cards was a nice geography lesson for her. Riley's foot is fine - still a little sore, but nothing broken, so that was good news.  Too bad the PE teachers left the doctor's note in their mailbox all week and tried to make her participate.  Sometimes you just want to slap people.  The 4th grader doesn't have any business trying to figure out where her note went once I dropped it off the other day. We are off to piano for one dd tonight and the cancer center is having an open house to celebrate 20 years.  I suppose we will go to that. Talk to everyone soon, Julie ",

I have started walking with my mother.  We went Fri and Sat so I'm hoping I will feel better after being out in the fresh air some more.  We had high winds here today, but didn't get much rain or tornados, unlike other towns in the area.  Last week lost 3 shutters so dh said no need to put them back on if they are going to come off again.  Jean - I hope you don't get a lot of snow.  We watched weather channel during our storms and the whole midwest looked crazy. Otter - loved the flower pictures over on fb.  I have about 3\" of green sticking out of the ground so we are getting closer.

Some of the younger kids couldn't reach the floor with their feet. They were so cute.  Katie played a song from the Lord of the Rings soundtrack.  She has definitely improved.  Riley is in a program called Simply Music and that works for her.

Back to the cooking - I don't mind doing it - I hate making something for me and the girls to eat early, but it has to stay warm nicely for dh to get home and usually what we like, the girls don't like.  Katie is my carbohydrate addict and Riley is trying to eat healthy.  They don't like much in the way of meat and only like a few veggies. Gracie - I don't know if Hallmark has a card for baby eyebrows, but I would send you one if they did.  Maybe we should start our own line of chemo cards. Gotta go - Rily hurt her foot dancing around last night and she can't walk so we have an early doctor's appointment. It's always something ... Julie",

You asked about surgeon follow up.  Mine wanted to see me every 3 mos for 2 yrs and then spread it out after that, but I've still been seen by the oncs so haven't gone back to her yet.  My lumpectomy was a year ago last Saturday (done by a different surgeon) and my SNB anniversary is next month.  I will probably go see her then, just so she can check everything from a surgeon's point of view.  But I'm scheduled for my 6-month mammo in May so someone has had his/her hands on me about every other month since rads ended. Jen - how was the u/s? Dana and RanD, too - Rock did a great job expressing her love and ours, too for you girls.  I look at it like marriage.  We'll take you for better or for worse, in sickness and in health and hope we can help lift your spirits if you are at a low point in treatment and celebrate everything else.  Don't be afraid of coming here with any kind of news.  We're a sisterhood that will stick together.  I can definitely relate to not getting anything else done - especially since I've gone to FB.  I just keep telling my husband that \"I've been busy\" and yes that does include tending my new farm on FB's Farm Town.  I hope that makes sense. Mary - need trip details - sorry you had to jump right back in at work. Talk to you all later - Julie",

We got some bad news this morning and I need some happy thoughts/prayers from all of you.  My mom's sister's husband passed away in his sleep last night.  She is my aunt who had bc 8 years ago.  It is just such a shock.  He had a huge stroke about 20 years ago and recovered relatively well and has had two kinds of cancer since.  Such a peaceful way to go.  My parents are on the way to my grandpa's to tell him.  My grandma died a year ago on March 1.  Sorry - some dates just don't go away.  We are on spring break this week so will be able to do anything necessary, but this is sad.  They have 3 kids and 6 granddaughters. I'll come back later for more.  Rock - thinking about your friend, too. Karin - couldn't wait until later - love the picture - you look mahvelus! Julie",

Cris - the band concert was nice.  It was mostly a chorus concert.  The band only had 3 songs, but they were difficult.  These were the songs they played at the Six Flags competition.  They played Mars (from the Planets) by Gustav Holst and Intrada and Dance by Elliot Del Borgo.  The band director said she played the Mars song when she was in college so it was quite an accomplishment for a Middle School band to play it.  Even my MIL was impressed and that doesn't happen often.  She helped out with band and chorus when my BIL was in school so nothing can compare to what they did way back when. Jackie - strawberries sound good.  They are our favorite fruit.  Riley uses the magic bullet to make smoothies.  How is everyone adjusting in your household? RanD and Rock - soft hugs coming your way.  I'm so glad your friend posted for you on your blog, Rock.  I've been trying to figure out the time difference all day.

I was also hoping that there would be a miracle and prove the onc wrong.  He's been doing this longer that I have. Take care - Julie - May '08",

I did tx on a Tuesday, Neulasta shot on Wednesday.  Started feeling achy by Wed and Thursday and just kind of tired, flu like until about the next Monday.  The next week I felt so-so and by the 3rd week I felt like doing things. I shaved my hair in the 3rd week of the first tx.  You will lose all of your hair everywhere which was a bonus during the summer.  I didn't shave much at all.  I had a wig ready to go before I shaved my hair, but didn't wear it at all.  I stuck with hats and bandanas and wore nothing at home.  It was just too hot. Food may not taste right or sound good.  It was kind of like being pregnant again.  I ate what did sound good and didn't worry about whether it was a balanced diet or not.  I like ramen noodles and canned peaches. Read through some of the other posts and keep coming back if you have more questions.  Feel free to PM me, too.  You will also find out that some women have side effects that doctors say can't be attributed to chemo, but they are.  Everyone is different and the hardest thing is waiting for the first treatment so you know what to expect.  Some cancer centers give a class or teaching about chemo.  Write down any questions and keep asking them.  It all seems overwhelming right now, but you will be a pro by the time you have the 4th tx.  Keep in mind that the fatigue can be cummulative and it might take a little longer each time to feel a little more normal. Don't let anyone tell you how you should or shouldn't feel.  Don't do what you don't feel like doing and don't try to make any excuses. You have to come first right now. Unless they've gone through this, they can't even imagine what you are experiencing.  That's why this place is great. Best of luck JulieC - class of May '08",

One thing to avoid - the hospital gift shop - LOL.  Being in the hospital every day was starting to take a toll on my checkbook.  I'd think, one more treatment done, time for a treat.  Finally they changed my schedule and the gift shop wasn't open that early. Good luck with everything - Julie",
