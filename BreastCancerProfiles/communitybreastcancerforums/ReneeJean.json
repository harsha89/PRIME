It needed to be on my right side as my cancer and SNB were on the left.  My TE's are very high (I have a wide but short chest) so he placed it in the only place he could.   It will be very visible in any type of v-neck or scoop neck shirt...oh well....it will be gone before summer and the scar will fade.  I am just vain enough to be thankful all this is happening to me as winter approaches---the hats, wigs, scarves, clothing to cover up with, etc......much better than hot humid summer where I tend to wear as few clothes as I can get decently by with<g>  ",

It is a very personal decision and not easy for some of us to make.  I hate surgery and I hate being ill...and I am very healthy....so I wanted the easiest and fastest treatment and recovery....but then I had to weigh that against my future.  For me, I made the right choice.",

This is not a fun journey, but it is one we will survive and come out the other side.  That is my prayer and beleif!  Hugs to all.",
