Am triple negative, so couldn't do any of the five year stuff.  Four years later, during annual mammogram, tumor was found in left breast.  I decided our love affair was over and had a BMX with no recon.  Don't regret that decision. This time through chemo has been horrendous. Seriously want to just quit and take my chances since I played everything by the books and got a new cancer anyway.  But my onc says this is to prevent mets.  Right now I think this is too much to deal with. First time, though, my sister came to help.  One day I had a meltdown over a dirty kitchen.  I am a very clean person. Both my husband and my sister thought I might need to see a therapist so I called one and went the next day.  Know what she said? First, that it was the drugs making me act crazy and if my family didn't understand that then perhaps THEY should be seeing the therapist. Secondly, she told me to be very specific about what help I need.  I brought that to this treatment as well.  It's the poisons going through my system that makes me grouchy and depressed.  Plus, being sick day after day after day without let up is depressing.  I need things to control my se not anti-depressants.  Have been hospitalized twice in two treatments. I am sick, not depessed in the clinical sense.  So, give yourself a break.  Explain this to your family.   To help with chemo brain this time, I play word games on my iphone every day.  Last time I couldn't concentrate to read anything.  This time I'm reading book after book which is such a relief. I feel like shit but am hoping to muddle through.  Here's hoping you can do the same!",

That was the last night of the Olympics. Hair went pretty quickly. My 2nd treatment was on 8-23. My onc eliminated neulasta from the mix since that was the only thing different from the chemo 4 yrs ago. About a week out, had just about every se there is!! Next my fever spiked to 103 and I had no energy whatsoever. Yep, the hives came back but I had all the stuff to treat at home. Anyway, it was Labor Day weekend of course and on Mon. couldn't hold out any more and went back to ER. All my counts were way way down and was admitted. Massive doses of antibiotics, to units of blood, and three days later I was permitted to come home. My onc said once the hives came back, she new it was an allergic reaction to taxotere and I couldn't take it any longer. Now she wants to replace it with andriamycin for my 3rd treatment on the 12th. I refused the muga test cause they couldn't use my port and I can't be stuck due to le so had an echo instead. While home have read what I can about this \"new\" drug and have to admit I am scared of it. Well, actually, am scared of the 3rd chemo period! Don't want to end up so sick again and back in hospital. I am tempted to quit and my onc and I discussed this and she urges me forward because I'm TN as well and she wants to give me that weapon against mats. Plus my dh would be devastated if I quit. But. I haven't had a day that I felt ok again and this is supposed to be my good time before next treatment. I don't even know what I'm asking here. Chemo brain has hit big time! Oh yeah. Anyone have allergic reaction to taxotere? Anyone on adriamycin and your experiences with it? Anyone want to quit and did? Did it make a difference? Any words of encouragement? I am down down and nearly defeated. I feel like my body is quitting on me and I don't know what to do. I still have se from the 2nd treatment and no energy. Both times the bc caught early but this time had bmx. And this time chemo is so so much worse even though my attitude going in was pretty good and positive. Am I letting myself down?

Luckily you were smart enough to find this site.  I'm sure some of our knowledgeable LE sisters will contribute more info. Hope you don't join our \"swell\" group!",

There's a website called Step Up-Speak Out, which is an invaluable source of information.  I suggest that if you haven't visited it yet, do so as soon as you can.  You will find answers to many of your questions.  There are several women here who are absolute experts on many aspects of le and I'm sure they will be responding soon.  Honestly, these women give so much of themselves to help us.  I don't know what I'd have done without them. One thing I have learned is that le reacts differently for different women.  So once you get yourself \"unswelled\", learn how to massage, do the exercises, wrap, etc., etc., etc. you will be able to experiment on what works for you and what doesn't.  For me, I learned I have to wear my compression garments every day all day or I swell.  I have to massage twice a day or I swell.  I had to cut way way back on things like gardening and being outside in general during the hottest parts of the day or I swell.  Like I said, it's a learning process. I hope this helps a little bit but as I said, it's from my perspective.  Yours may be different.  Just know that we are all here to support you as best we can.    ",

After all, I'm 68 with all that that implies breast-wise, Plus four years ago, I'd had a lumpectomy with chemo and rads, so there were ugly scars. Still, they were MY boobs and had been with me all my life.  The morning after surgery a resident I'd never seen before popped in to check on me. Some young guy with plenty of knowledge but totally lacking in life experiences. He caught me when I was silently crying with tears rolling down my cheeks, snotty nose. One of those ugly cries. He says to me, not unkindly, \"You know, this is the second time I've seen you and both times you've been crying. I want you to know you don't have to feel this way. What say we put you on antidepressants and make you feel happier.\" My dander rose. \"Look,\" I said to him, \"my breasts that I've had all my life were just amputated and I think it's a perfectly natural, normal thing to mourn their loss, especially the morning after. What if you had your penis cut off? How would you feel?\" A nurse who was standing there put her hand over her mouth to hide her smile. And when he left the room, she patted me and said I did good. Today it's three weeks. Emotionally I'm much better but occasionally I have my moments. That's mostly due to the dread of treatment to come. I am pleased that my surgeon listened to me when I told him I wouldn't ever want recon. He gave me what I asked for and I am grateful. I can see that it will heal in a most acceptable way to me and my dh. It's something we both can live with for sure. So don't be afraid to feel your emotions. It's not wrong; it's the way you feel and it's a natural and normal reaction.",

Still, was better than the last time. I wasn't bedridden. I could read. The Olympics kept me occupied when I had to zone out. All in all my personal triumph. Saturday was my best day and coincided with a break in weather, in the 70s and no humidity. I sat on the deck for several hours enjoying the gardens and stayed out of the sun. Sunday, the shit hit the fan. Woke up with me scalp on fire and my fingernails raking through the itches. My palms were on fire and itchy. Then uder my arms, then groin. By 10:30 pm we were off to the ER, me thinking this can't be cellulitis. It wasn't. Hives. It was the 11th day after chemo so it wasn't reaction to that. DH and I went over everything I used, ate, did and couldn't figure out what it the cause was. Anyway, the medical team mixed me up a nice drug cocktail, injected into my port and half hour later the itch was tolerable, the swelling in my hands down and it was sweet relief. They told me not to wear compression for a couple days. Another sweet relief. Took it easy, elevated, rested, MLD'd three times a day and came through OK. Today I felt I needed compression so donned my sleeve and gauntlet and will take off if need be. Myofacial is completely gone under left used to be breast, and releasing nicely on right, where previous radiation presented more of a challenge. Am still swollen and don't feel comfortable getting foobs yet. What's the rush, right? Hair started falling out in buckets yesterday and almost bald in front. Gonna get it all shaved off this afternoon. Got my \"Hair by Chemo\" hat ready. No wigs, no scarves for me. My biggest challenge is losing my anger over cancer coming back.  Intellectually, I realize I'm a lot better off than many women. Emotionally, it's a big \"why me.\" But slowly, am gaining control over that crap. I do not miss my boobs. Not one bit. This surprises me, since I was so wrecked at the thought of having a BMX.  Am having a lot of nerve regeneration issues but discovered if I stand up, do some shoulder rolls and chest stretches, I get some relief. Sometimes, though, I can't stand to have clothing touch my skin and have to give in and sit here chest exposed.  I've been trying to think of a short term for \"my chest formerly known as boobs.\" Any ideas anyone?

I, too, went to an le therapist, but am also lucky to have an le doctor.  Both are wonderful.  The therapist provided massage and taught me how to do it, taught me to bandage (gave me two sets of bandages and I order additional items from Lymphedema Products.com),  and when my four weeks in bandages were up and my swelling under control, she measured me for the sleeve and gauntlet.  She recommended Juzo, which turned out to be perfect for me.  I started with two sleeves and two gauntlets.  Now I'm up to four sleeves and six gauntlets (the gauntlets tend to get dirty fast).   I figure if you have more and alternate them, they will last longer than six months, but mark them, which I forgot to do.  Oh well.  I also got a variety of sleeve coverings by Sassy Sleeves to provide the loudness my life needs.  I'm sure when the fall sleeve/gauntlet colors come out, I will order a few of those. It's a steep learning curve and at first lymphedema occupied all my thinking.  It seemed completely overwhelming and I was really depressed.  Binny and Kira told me it would get better and, by darned, they were right.  I decided early on that I would comply with my doctor's and therapist's instructions to the letter and I have lived up to that.  I do MLD and exercises twice a day, I wrap at night when something seems \"off\" to me, and I wear my sleeve and gauntlet all day, every day. Since this is a very individualized condition, once you become more confident, you can experiment with things a little.  I'm not quite there yet, but I sure would like to be able to go without a sleeve on special occasions.  I'm still finding my way as far as life adjustments. Except for once a month le massage, my regular therapy is completed.  I have had several flares which I was able to handle myself with the help of people here.  My confidence has grown by leaps and bounds and I'm feeling better and better about dealing with this.   We were dealt a hand of crap, to put it bluntly, but we can learn to manage it and take care of ourselves.   I hope this helped a little bit and that you will keep on posting and asking questions.  You will find strength, humor, tears, laughter and more here.   ",

You know, Nats and Faith, when I was wearing bandages, everyone asked  me about it.  Now that I'm on the sleeve (or the sleeve's on me), no one has asked.  Of course, it's been so cold here that I've had to wear hoodies.  Today I planted my mailbox planter and a big planter in front of the house.  Still felt good, so I trimmed the Japanese Maple which was drooping to the ground.  Tomorrow I'm volunteering at the Kentucky Horse Park.  2,000 4th graders are coming to see an Arabian show.  Then it's a breast cancer group meeting.  Looks like I'm getting back into life.  Am actually looking forward to massaging tonight and I think I'll wrap just to be safe.  Again, I appreciate everyone for supporting my up/down mood changes.  It seems so stupid sometimes.  But this le thing is something else.  I'm sure this isn't the end.

She then began asking me questions about my therapy.  Did I feel it did any good (duh), did I feel comfortable self-managing, did I wear my sleeve and gauntlet every day or just for dr appts.             I dunno if I did much good at all.  But I do know that a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and I feel I accomplished one tiny step today.  I believe my radiology oncologist will be more aware of the women in her care and be on the lookout for signs of le in her patients. My next step?  Tackling the clinic powers that be.  That's more than one step, however.  But I am going to do this.   Feel pretty good.  Dx 9/26/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 0/14 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Dx 5/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, 0/1 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 6/26/2012 Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel; Mastectomy: Left; Prophylactic mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 8/1/2012 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

Anyway, though I wear a sleeve and gauntlet rather than glove, the gauntlet, too, can become pretty disgusting PDQ.  I now keep a box of disposable gloves in a kitchen drawer.  In a very short time it became second nature to grab one and put it on when meal prepping and sometimes using it when eating a particularly messy something or other, like a nice juicy peach.  When I start to sweat, I take it off, pitch it, dry and lotion my hand and put another one on until I'm done.  I also got some extra gauntlets for those just-in-case times.  I keep one in my car, one in my purse, and one with all my LE stuff.   My dh was helpful from the get-go.  My LE is in my dominant arm and hand so I have a difficult time wrapping myself.  He learned before me but I was determined to conquer it.  I do fine with the fingers and up to my  elbow wrapping but once I get to the upper arm...well, let's just say that sometimes the tears and curse words fly!  Just ordered a nightsleeve so I can feel some sense of independence.  Despite all his support and loving help, he, too, thought it might not be too helpful for me to go on this site every day.  I explained it to him as best I could.  If he still feels that way, he keeps it to himself.  I understand that he wishes things could just be life before.  I think it's just now dawning on him that this is a forever thing and I have to learn to manage it physically AND mentally.  This is my go-to place for support, understanding, sympathy, education, and sometimes even fun. I'm glad you had the courage to fight through the crap and get the help you needed.  Aren't we strong women!!! ",

Cynthia, when we were young, something similar happened to us. Had to leave CA for awhile and move back to PA to my family.  We missed CA so much that after a few months decided to take our chances and go back.  It was a different time then, not so crazy as now.  We always were grateful that family was there for us to help us back on our feet.  All the best to you.",

One more thing.  Recently I posted about the possibility of glaucoma being related to LE.  I asked my Chickley about it and she says Dr. Chickley did extensive research on it and to him there is definitely a connection, so she LE massaged my eyes to release some of the fluid build up.  I haven't learned to do it myself yet.  I also found online that they recently discovered that the eyes do, in fact, have a lymphatic system which could drastically change how glaucoma is treated.  Hmmm.  Printed it out to take to my opth. And that's all the info that I forgot to write last night.  Back to the extensive heat and humidity today.  Cripes. ",
