She held up surprisingly well, but I was a mess. I never embraced the bald look - didn't show my husband for a few days, didn't show my kids for a few weeks. I wore a sleep cap at night (it was January) and a wig during the day. My hair started to grow back before I even finished chemo, but it takes a long time. I had hair that was below my shoulders. It's now as long as my neck. Last summer was when I quit wearing the wig (too hot) and then quit the ball caps and bandanas (didn't really go with some outfits). I'm not much of an accessory person and never embraced scarves and stuff. It's a huge adjustment for sure - in your pillow, in the shower, in the mirror - and you'll adjust. But cry when you need to because it's no good keeping it all in. ",

The number of treatments will be the same regardless of which one I do. How long each session lasts is also about the same, but the time in the room is a little longer with proton because of the set up (maybe 10 minutes longer). Proton therapy has less risks to areas of the body past the breast since the radiation stops there. The SE's to the skin and breast are very similar with the newer versions of the proton equipment (this place opened about a year ago and has the newest type). There is no hard data (hence the trials) to prove that one type is better than the other for breast cancer, but they believe proton is at least equal to photon and perhaps better. And there definitely would be less risk to heart and lung - especially important if lymph nodes also needed to be irradiated. Insurance sometimes will balk about covering proton. I honestly haven't even looked into my own insurer, but I will. The RO seemed to think that if it was a problem then she could appeal for an exception ahead of time. I could also participate in a clinical trial if I was interested in doing that. ",

There are \"oncoplastic\" techniques - where they basically push and stitch the tissue together to fill in the hole during surgery. But that can be a problem with healing sometimes and definitely makes things harder if they don't get good margins and have to go back. Radiation is also required with lumpectomy and that can further alter the tissue so that any cosmetic help would need to wait until after that. If your breasts are small and there are three tumors then doing a lumpectomy may just be taking too much tissue to leave you with a decent result - even if they can reach them all through one incision. And radiation would most likely make what's left smaller, firmer, and higher. I've gotten second opinions for everything. It's just better for my mental health to hear from more than one doctor about anything significant. I'd recommend at least consulting with someone else. ",

Jezikah - Yes, I would call the MO office about your hands. But a dermatologist might be your best bet if it doesn't seem like something they see. I broke out in a rash after my first round and the MO wasn't sure if maybe it was \"disseminated Shingles\" or not. I ended up seeing the dermatologist and they did a biopsy which showed something called \"Grover's\" disease. MO's are pretty familiar with chemo induced skin problems and should be able to tell you if that's the problem. I go for round three today - more anxious this time, I think. Which seems weird.

I think the best thing I ever read was someone saying you can always change your mind later and get the mastectomy, but you can't get your breast back. I'll have another breast MRI after chemo and make the decision.

So glad to have all of you! I'll add my two cents about a couple of side effects: Mouth sores - Mine were the worst when my WBC's were low after the first round (without Neulasta and ending up in the hospital with neutropenic fever). I was prescribed \"Duke's\" mouthwash - sometimes called \"Magic\" mouthwash. You have to get it formulated from certain pharmacies. It includes something for pain as well as antibiotics and antifungals. I'll be interested to try the Aloe juice for the burnt feeling that I get now. I also sucked on ice chips during the last round per MO advice. Skin peeling - Oh, your poor hands and fingers! I only had tiny spots at the very tips of my fingers, near the nails. I used Aquaphor on them and that helped. I've mostly had more like skin drying and flaking - first back of hands, then bottoms of feet, then palms, now lower legs. None of that hurts - it's just like all of my skin decided to change over at once. GI problems - So it turns out that chemo and NSAID's and steroids can ALL work against your stomach. I was diagnosed with gastritis and esophagitis and reflux. The lump in my throat was from esophageal spasms from the reflux with the horrible acid burps. Being on Prilosec has made almost all of that go away. We'll see what happens with this next round. I'm planning a constant stream of cold beverages during the chemo drugs. Eyes/Nose - I've had the dripping eyes and nose at times. I read that the eye problem can actually be from dry eyes (sounds weird) which I already had. Eye drops that are moisturizing can help. Don't know what to do about the nose except keep a tissue nearby. I expect that has to do with my bloody nose issues, too. Hair/Scalp - I had my hair buzzed to about a quarter inch when it started falling out like crazy. I was told I would lose my hair and it was very traumatic for me. However - it hasn't all left! It's patchy on the top and sides but much thicker on the back. Some is still falling out and some is growing! I almost wish it would all just go. This just looks so weird. I've been using Nioxin 3 shampoo and conditioner and that seems to make my scalp feel better. I was about ready to quit after round 2 - so discouraged about how I was feeling after being hopeful that the changes in dosages would make a difference. I've been feeling almost normal for about a week now so at least I've had that. Next round is Wednesday. Ugh! ",

Now I can see that I will end up with deep grooves across my nails as they grow out because of that. I do use lotion and have put Aquaphor around the bases. The nails don't hurt - they feel like they are being pressed on if that makes sense. Any neuropathy has been limited to a burning feeling in my feet and a tingling feeling in my fingers. Everyone should be reporting any of that to their MO because it can get progressively worse. Adjustments in chemo dosages can make a difference. Scaredashell - you should definitely talk to the MO about the GI pain. I'm on Omeprazole now and it has made a huge difference. I had terrible burps that burned and stomach pain. All of it made me less likely to eat, too. My office will not give the chemo without the steroids. And I totally get the feeling halfway through. You'd think I'd be overjoyed to have made it this far. All I can think is that it can't possibly be only halfway. I get anxious just thinking about three more chemo's.

CCNC - I can't really tell what my hair is doing. I think that some is growing back, but I never lost all of it anywhere. It just looks really sparse. The sections behind my ears are the thickest and that is growing probably normally, but I still have stubble that's the same on top. Definitely less body hair everywhere but biggest loss is pubic and underarm hair! As far as surgery - I haven't felt the lump since after the first treatment so that seems promising. I'm leaning towards lumpectomy. I'd really like to keep my body intact as much as possible. And I don't want further surgeries down the road. I have lots of questions still about all of the treatment left and meet with the BS before the last chemo. I met with the NP at the MO office yesterday. I was considering stopping chemo due to all of the side effects and concerns about life long problems. I feel like I've had a worse time with the second and third even though the first one put me in the hospital. I think I'm going to try one more - substituting Neupogen for Neulasta - and see how that goes. I get all four drugs once every three weeks for six rounds. The plan is to continue Herceptin every three weeks for a year. I'm not working during this. I'm amazed at those of you who are! I'm an RN and typically do home care visits.

So on to the hospital for blood and urine cultures and chest x-ray - by then the Neutrophils were 0. I was kept there for 3 days and given strong IV antibiotics and Neupogen. The oncologist explained that between the damage to the intestinal tract from chemo and the lack of Neutrophils, bacteria from your gut can escape into your body and set up shop. It is very serious and can lead to sepsis - which if not stopped can lead to organ failure and death. We really need our WBC's!",

Just a change of scenery is nice. There is so much conflicting information that it drives me crazy. I'm pretty much an \"everything in moderation\" person. I don't see myself making a bunch of radical changes in my life to perhaps decrease my chances of recurrence. My MO has never even discussed diet or environmental stuff with me. As a matter of fact - he's not a proponent of vitamins (I still take a multivitamin and a B complex daily) or the usefulness of Claritin for Neulasta SE's (I take that, too). It's also weird how each location or practice does things differently. You'd think that they'd all be using the same guidelines. No icing of hands or feet where I am. No mention of nail polish. No cold capping. The only thing in that regard was a recommendation of sucking on ice chips and drinking cold beverages during the chemo infusions (Carboplatin and Taxotere) to decrease mouth and stomach problems. GI - I'm on Omeprazole 40 mg daily for the stomach problems. I was told to limit dairy due to some people having a problem with lactose during treatment. I think the diarrhea improved with adding Culturelle (for good bacteria) and Citrucel (for added fiber/bulk). I've only had a true bloody nose (couple times) after the 2nd round. I always get some blood-tinged mucous for a week or so after. And the drippy nose for no reason. I'm meeting with my MO today to discuss further treatment. I'm scheduled for #4 tomorrow and going to discuss merit of 4 vs 6 rounds. Also possibly switching to Neupogen since last Neulasta had my WBC's 3 times the upper limit of normal a week later! Are all of you in \"chemopause\" now? I had a fairly normal period in January and one day of spotting this month! I'm wondering if that's it?

No one could tell me why some had disappeared - could be response to chemo or could be lack of hormones. I wasn't comfortable with that much unknown and opted to just do the BMX.

I spent a good deal of time on this wonderful website early on and then burned out on information overload. I've read every post in this thread over the last few days and can't keep everyone straight, but I so appreciate the camaraderie! I was diagnosed in November after finding a lump myself. I had not been very good about BSE's because I seem to always have some \"lumps and bumps\" - have even had providers send me for diagnostic work-ups in the past - and had a normal mammogram in June. I was as overwhelmed as most of you were and followed the crazy schedule of testing and consults: mammogram, ultrasound, core needle biopsy of tumor and axillary lymph node, breast surgeon, medical oncologist, general surgeon, radiation oncologist, second opinion on pathology and with second breast surgeon, breast MRI, echocardiogram. I had a port placed on 12/5 and started chemo the following week so have now completed two rounds. I felt the port placement was worse than I expected - apparently they had to give me more medication during the surgery than they anticipated. It also hurt more afterwards but that seemed to be more related to the adhesive dressing because it was much better when I was able to remove that after 48 hours. Chemo has been rough for me with many side effects. It's so frustrating to not be able to predict or plan for anything! I know that we are all different, but still ... First round - I had aches and pains, terrible mouth problems, and low WBC's. I ended up hospitalized with neutropenic fever and was given antibiotics and Neupogen to bring up the cell counts. Luckily, I responded quickly and only spent 2 nights in the hospital. Second round - They decreased three of the drugs due to my prior response and added Neulasta. I also sucked on ice chips during the two chemo drug infusions. Same pains on day 3/4 but much worse burping, reflux, heartburn. I felt like anything I ate just burned going down and I had persistent abdominal and chest pain with a lump in my throat. Thankfully, I was put on Prilosec and Carafate which helped relatively quickly. So I go back to see my MO tomorrow and for blood work - I'm SO not ready for another round. I had visions of myself refusing further chemo. I worry about the possible problems to the healthy rest of me! I was told the second round would be so much better because of the changes they were making. I feel like it's a guessing game and I hate taking all this medicine. You wonder what is causing what! Anyway - sorry for such a long post. I'll try to add to the conversation and not monopolize it! Just thought it might help to know where I'm coming from.",

For those of you who mentioned teeth sensitivity - my dentist recommended Prevident for me before I started chemo. It's a prescription toothpaste with added fluoride. My version isn't specific for sensitivity, but I'm pretty sure they make one for that. It might help more than the OTC stuff. My fingernails never lifted or discolored, but they all developed a ridge across them due to the first round wreaking havoc with my cuticles and all the skin on my hands. So now that the ridges are about halfway grown out, 6 of my nails have broken way down on the side. I guess I'll be dealing with snagging them on everything for quite a while.

I would hope that your BS and MO could explain their reasons for wanting it for you. And I'm always a proponent of second or third opinions. To answer your questions: I had NAC because it is pretty much the standard of care for HER2+ cancers. It was highly successful and I was lucky enough to have a complete response. Because of my experience, I would absolutely recommend it to my daughter, mother, sister, friend. I was able to have surgery 5 weeks after finishing the 6 rounds. I could not feel the lump after the first round and was able to get all of my doses on schedule. I was 50 when diagnosed. Chemo is generally very successful against the cancers that it's recommended for. The best way to understand the purpose of chemo is that it is able to go throughout your body and kill any cancer cells - not just those at the site of the tumor. Surgery and/or radiation can only treat the area where the cancer was found. Most breast cancers are slow growing, but those found in younger women are more likely to be more aggressive. Delaying surgery for chemo first does not increase your risk for metastasis. And it can also inform your doctors of how effective the chemo was on final pathology. ",

I'm hoping to be able to meet with 2 PS and discuss their opinions first. I had my post chemo MRI and got great results - no evidence of cancer remaining! But I worry about some areas that were seen in the other breast that are now gone as well ... It's so hard to know what to do. I definitely don't want to repeat this. And I don't really want more surgery than I need. Or repeat surgeries. And I'd like to avoid rads. Ugh - no good options!

Those sites were already sore so having them removed wasn't too bad. I was also still on pain meds at that point - taking one Percocet every 6 hours as well as muscle relaxants. My husband took off from work for the first two weeks and then I was on my own. I have three kids ranging in age from 11 to 16 so they are in three different levels of school. Getting everyone out the door to the bus was my morning challenge! By two weeks, I was no longer on narcotics and started driving. While that was somewhat difficult due to stiffness - it was manageable for local trips. The only restrictions that I was given were to wear a bra 24/7, no lifting more than 10 pounds, and no raising my arms more than shoulder height. I'm still in a bra, but no other restrictions now. I go to PT twice a week and they've really helped with range of motion and now with strengthening. ",

That might mean that 49.5% of people could not tolerate that dose! Obviously - less worked for me! ",

I truly agonized over surgical decisions and I had the whole mess of chemo to spend doing it! Can't imagine making these decisions on a shorter time table. Keep reminding yourself that there are no wrong decisions. It's just what seems right for you. Everyone will be watching you very closely for quite some time afterwards as well. We all have to weigh the information we have and move forward as best as we can. I went to see the PS yesterday for follow up. He pulled both drains so I'm free of more \"equipment\" now. It really didn't hurt at all - just a little stinging when they took out the stitches holding them in. They are watching one area around my L nipple that's reddened but seems to have good blood flow. I get a bit discouraged about how things look and feel, but he reminds me that it's been less than a week since I had the equivalent of 3 major surgeries! Says will look so much better by 6 weeks and great by 6 months. Trying to be patient. Anyway - the soreness at the drain sites is WAY better! ",

I was so unhappy about how I looked and felt - just really down and depressed and exhausted. I found myself wondering if I had made a huge mistake with the choice of surgery and missing my breasts. Just everything was upsetting. I cried a lot for a couple of days. But it does get better! I only had the drains for 6 days and they were a drag. Definitely felt better without them, but ... I have a small area (actually a couple) of fluid. The PS has tried on 2 occasions to remove it with a needle and syringe - no go. So we wait for my body to take care of it. I started to feel a lot better physically after about 2 weeks. That constant pressure and tightness feeling is much less now. The achy, bruised feeling is only at times. The underarms still hurt some - feels like razor burn almost. And my sides hurt - worse if touched. PS says due to tissue being removed. Muscles and connective tissue now without cushioning. But I'm moving so much better and only take ES Tylenol once or twice a day. PT is helping me regain motion. I can tilt to the side to sleep so my back thanks me. Driving is easier now. Everything is. And how I look is improved. I don't love it by any means. But just having the swelling and bruising pretty much gone is a huge difference. I keep hearing that it takes weeks to months for things to settle. And it's not like I'm wanting any more surgery any time soon. I hope you get good news on your pathology report. Be kind to yourself. Allow yourself to be sad, angry, frustrated - whatever. At least the surgery part is behind you! ",

I really didn't think that they'd be able to fit me in since I'm late even reconsidering this option and now 4 weeks out from my last chemo. I got a call yesterday saying that the OR time is available and so are both surgeons so if I want it ... So ... I'm going for it. I hope I'm making the right decision. My original BS was pushing for lumpectomy, especially since I seem to have had a PCR on imaging post chemo. And my MO has no qualms about being very anti-mastectomy. But I just kept coming back to how fast the cancer grew, the HER2 + problem, my concerns about radiation, stuff seen in the other side, etc. Now I have one week to prepare. I may die of anxiety before I get to surgery! The PS said it is much better to have any reconstruction done before radiation. The radiated tissues are more difficult to adjust, stretch, heal. I will most likely not need radiation with the MX since my response was so good. He will hopefully place implants above the pectoral muscles with Alloderm since I'm aiming to stay about the same size. If he feels that it will be too much stress on the skin then he'll use TE's. Of course, I'd rather have just the one surgery. But healing well is more important. He's already mentioned fat grafting down the road to fill in the upper portion if needed. Remali - Yes, MRI's are useful. I had one before any treatment to verify that there was only the one tumor in the L breast and evaluate the R breast. They did another post chemo to check chemo response. I'm not sure about the difference in how DCIS shows up, but both my lump and some stuff in the other breast showed up loud and clear.",

I feel like I don't remember much from the actual day of surgery - remember being rolled out of the pre-op area and then don't even remember getting to my hospital room. Weird - nothing at all in my brain from the recovery room or transferring to my bed in my room or anything! Lots of meds, I guess! I was pretty dependent on help for getting up and down for the first couple of days. It's amazing how much you need your chest! But I managed in the bathroom alone, thankfully! My breasts these days are strangely numb and sensitive at the same time. If I touch them then they feel numb, but I have this burning type of sensation all across my chest. I also still have a feeling of pressure, like my breasts are being smushed all the time. And both armpits are very sore, especially the one that the lymph nodes were taken out of. The only real \"pain\" is some where the drains were and some along the incision line, especially one area that bothers me in the early morning. That's the only time that I'm taking anything stronger than Tylenol since last week. And I'm not a particularly strong person in regards to pain. I had a few very weepy days last weekend. I think that all of this kind of hit me. I've probably been so busy trying to be normal and go through all this shit that it finally came down on me - the fear, the loss, all of it. I still have some of those emotions but seem to be coping better now. My BS recommended a PT/lymphedema evaluation - should have been pre-op for a baseline, but there was no time for that. So I saw them last week and they did some kind of test for lymph flow and everything was normal. They gave me papers with exercises to do and I will see them twice a week for four weeks to regain range of motion and strength. Really makes me kick myself for not exercising in some form before!

I still don't feel comfortable a lot of the time. Just being still, I'm usually not in any pain or discomfort. But pretty much all around the edges of the implants are kind of sensitive if pressed on at all. I get pulling or tightening sensations, too. I've had a lump under the nipple on the cancer side for probably at least 2-3 months. That nipple was pretty mangled during the surgery and I thought it would never be normal. I was pleasantly surprised to have it end up looking and acting (mostly) like a regular nipple. I saw my OB/GYN 2 months ago and she did an exam - no concerns. I alerted my MO to it and he did an exam - just follow up with the BS at the next routine appt. Last week saw the PS and he wanted me to get in earlier with the BS. So I saw her yesterday instead of next month and she's sending me for US. I really don't think it's cancer. I think it's probably scar tissue. But it sucks that I have to even have something else evaluated! I'm so sick of everything r/t cancer. Plus - the PS thinks the one implant has rotated and that's why I have a flat place on the side of one breast. And he recommends fat grafting to help cover the ripples, dents, hollows that I have. But the BS doesn't really want me to pursue that for \"a few years\" due to the risk of it causing more bumps or lumps during the time that they are more vigilant about recurrence. Good grief. I haven't even finished the Herceptin yet. And then there's the consideration of Nerlynx. It's never ending, I guess. Sorry. Had to vent a bit. Sometimes I feel sorry for myself in spite of feeling thankful. Does that make sense? ",

Most women can probably do skin and nipple sparing if the skin and nipple are not involved. The concern is for clear margins and good healing. Size is mostly a problem if you are choosing to go much larger or smaller - especially if you want to skip TE's. TE's are required if your skin can't be saved, in order to grow more skin. They're also necessary for larger size placements and often if radiation is going to be needed. I would expect they'd be need with DIEP for those same reasons. I'm not sure if they would do a SNB with LCIS. Technically it's contained and shouldn't have been able to leave the lobules. However - once the breast is removed, you can't do a SNB. Good question.

The surgeon gave me a prescription for Tylenol #3 and I took it occasionally for the first two days. My incision was only one line, about an inch or so long and covered with steristrips, gauze, and a transparent dressing. I had to leave the dressing on for two days. I think that added to any discomfort I felt. It was much better once that was off! It takes a while to get comfortable with it. Mine sticks out quite a bit, but you can't really see the catheter part. My surgeon marked my chest while I was wearing a bra so the bra never rubbed on it. I was lucky to get a Bard Power Port with a Groshong catheter so it only has to be flushed every 90 days and needs no Heparin. The infusion nurses would use the freezing spray before accessing it. That usually works really well. One time it didn't - not sure if it was the nurse or what. After that, I requested Emla cream and would put a big glob of it on about an hour before my appt. I've since had it flushed once with no numbing anything and it wasn't horrible. Good luck tomorrow.

I told my parents by phone that afternoon. It was easier for me than having to look them in the eyes. And I told my children (ages 16, 13, and 10) that evening after dinner. I think the main thing is to be honest about what facts you know. The kids can sense when stuff is going on and worry. They also generally have much less of a depressing knowledge base about cancer. Things are so much better these days! I just told them what treatment might entail and updated them as time went on. I contacted the guidance counselors later at each of their schools and told the kids that they could talk with them if they wanted. I hope it is the best news today. None of it is good, of course.

It's a super hard decision to make. There were many times that I wished that it wasn't mine to have to make! My biggest concerns that drove my decision - worries about the amount of breast left after LX, worries about the effects of radiation and \"using up\" that treatment, an area that they wanted to continue to \"watch\" in the other breast, concerns about symmetry - and - while not proven by research, a desire to do all I could in the hopes of never doing any of it again. I had negative genetic testing and had only had one great aunt with BC at an older age. But - I also had an aunt with ovarian cancer, a grandmother with pancreatic cancer, and several uncles with prostate cancer. I was diagnosed on the younger side at 50 and felt that I had many years ahead of me to possibly face it again. I don't know that I would have gone through with it if I would have had to have multiple surgeries, though. My second opinion BS recommended my PS and I was able to do a \"one and done\" surgery. In four hours, she removed the breast tissue and sentinel nodes and he placed implants above the muscle. I had two drains for six days. It was hard but not unbearable. There were times that I second guessed my decision. I did grieve the loss of my real breasts and I still miss nipple sensation. But - I look really very good without any further surgery and I regained some sensation (mostly around the edges). I was lucky to be a candidate for nipple and skin sparing. Implants don't have to be replaced unless there's a problem and they are lasting much longer than in the past. They also have many more options than before. I never considered using another part of my body to create a breast. These are very difficult decisions to make and each woman has her own nuances that she brings to the process. There really is no way to know how you'll feel later about it. It's strange to me how some people just \"know\" what they'll do right away - with confidence. That was not me at all. And yet, a decision has to be made. Good luck with making that decision. You just have to go with what you know right now and try to not look back. ",

I recently considered that it's kind of like an amputation. No, not nearly as serious or obvious or life-altering as losing an arm or a leg. But it is a loss. And there is grief and adjustment. Men are very visual creatures. For many - breasts are pretty exciting and it's hard to not look when they're put on display. I find that I notice breasts WAY more than I ever did before all of this. I've even felt jealous of my teenage daughter! The \"moving on\" comment comes from someone who is ready to move on himself. I don't think that anyone else can really understand what we go through. I'm sure he wishes that you could move on. Perhaps counseling (together or separately) would be helpful. Certainly explaining why that comment is hurtful is a good step. Please don't feel inadequate.

Have you contacted your insurer directly? I'm sure it's very stressful not knowing what's going to happen next. How do you feel about getting chemo? Would you be relieved to know you didn't need it or would you still feel like you wanted that insurance? That may help you make up your mind if you really can't wait for the testing. ",

More recently - some are on both Herceptin and Perjeta for the year. Most often, chemo is done first with surgery following 4-6 weeks after completion of the heavy chemo drugs. If surgery is done first then chemo is usually started 4-6 weeks later. The idea is to let your body recover from whichever treatment before you subject it to the next one I'm a big fan of second opinions. Even if you hear the same thing - the confirmation is so helpful. And as far as timing of starting any treatment - it's important to know what you are dealing with first and foremost. Mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRI's give a complete visual picture. And the full biopsy results give a basis for attack. You shouldn't unnecessarily delay starting treatment once you have all of the info, but you should also be as confident in the plan of care as possible. ",

Even with a very clear cut path, there are usually some variables. I'm one to question everything. Part of it is a desire to make the right choice and a need to really understand. I'm definitely a proponent of second (or third) opinions when it comes to cancer. I've read some of your other posts. I do understand the frustration with multiple images and multiple radiologists. The fact is - none of these things is 100% reliable. Each imaging modality has itstrengths and weaknesses. And providers have to walk a line between being overly cautious or dismissing possible concerns. I think that if at least two doctors are recommending an excisional biopsy then you should just go ahead and do that. It sucks if it turns out to be nothing, but it's not like they're recommending you remove your breast. Knowing is probably worth it. And if it turns out to be cancer - you'll be able to work on eradicating it. At the end of the day (weeks, months) - it's your choice. You can follow the advice of doctors who have been trained and taken an oath or not. You could always choose to \"watch and wait\" and see if anything changes. Yes, it sucks to not have absolute answers ahead of time. It's scary and frustrating. The final answer may be life altering sometimes. No one wants all this upheaval in their lives. ",

He equates it to almost a \"bedsore\" situation, where I don't have much soft tissue covering the bone there. The treatment? Staying off the area! Using the donut pillow ALL the time and reducing my sitting as much as possible. I'm willing to try that because I've mostly just done that to help - not consistently. If not improved in 6 weeks with active attempts to decrease pressure then he'll order an MRI to further evaluate. He seemed surprised that I had never had a PET scan with the original questionable nodes and Stage II. Because I was HER2+ and required chemo and not treated in a university setting, I think it was not considered imperative that further work up be done in the beginning. In any case - the cancer was very chemo sensitive and none was found at the time of surgery. And so I plod on ... hoping for the best and never quite believing it.",

I feel like I was a reasonably healthy person who happened to get cancer and the treatment ruined me or something. It's gotten to the point where I worry about seeing any doctors, having any tests, or taking any meds. There never seems to be a clear reason for anything, a definite answer or plan to make anything better. On the one hand - I cling to the pCR and tell myself that it hasn't even been a year since I finished Herceptin. I've had a negative xray and CT. This can't be cancer! And yet - it never completely leaves my mind as a possibility. I worry about not being on any hormonal therapy (long story). I worry that it hurts a lot sometimes, even though I try to use the tailbone cushion or lean to the side or forward. IDK. I have so many aches and pains that I feel ancient. I saw a Rheumatologist about a year ago for similar feelings - no tailbone problems then but the elbows, wrists, fingers, knees, etc. At that time, we ended up deciding it was probably r/t the Cipro I had been on for an infection. Between Meloxicam and a Medrol pack (as well as some injections in my shoulder), that got fixed and I felt normal-ish for a while. I have an appt scheduled to see him again now. And I'll probably request the MRI from Ortho. My insurance probably loves me ...",

The reason that women can have thickened uterine lining while on Tamoxifen is from the abundance of unopposed Estrogen and it's effects on the uterus. I recently went through a different scenario. My periods stopped with chemo and I only took Tamoxifen for a short while. I was found to have a thickened endometrium when I had some pretty significant lower abdominal pain one day. It continued to thicken on reassessment 3 months later and my GYN advised a D&C. And then I had a period! I haven't had another one in 3 months time (I'm 52) so maybe I'm done now. I'm not sure. The hormone testing seems to be moving more convincingly that way. And I do still debate trying Tamoxifen again except that I quit it for some kind of serious mental and emotional SE's. Perhaps a D&C would be a less invasive possibility for you? And then follow up on the lining and the periods? Only since there was no evidence of concerning cellular changes. And the entire lining would be sent to pathology to make sure nothing was missed. ",

And I had a lot of time to think it over because I didn't have surgery until after chemo was completed. After the initial thoughts (like yours), I had settled on LX. But when the time got closer, I started to debate again. My cancer was fast growing - I found the lump about 4 months after a normal mammogram. It was Stage 2 and HER2 positive. I had some areas in the other breast they were watching - some disappeared with chemo and some needed to be checked again in 6 months. I couldn't stand the thought of doing all of this again. Nothing is a guarantee. In my case - I felt like I would sleep better at night with the majority of breast tissue gone. I was lucky to be able to avoid radiation by choosing the BMX and I could keep both my skin and nipples and do a \"direct to implant\" surgery - no TE, no more surgery. I was still second guessing myself for quite a while afterwards - I'm just like that, I guess. I miss having normal sensation in my breasts and there are a number of things that I'm not thrilled about. I could (and might, one day) have revision surgery to correct a few things and contour with fat. Right now - I'm glad to be done. I think LX is a good choice depending on the size of the breast and the location of the tumor. My breasts weren't very large (B/C cup) and the tumor was at 12 o'clock. They were talking about taking a significant amount of tissue for LX and that rads would further shrink what was left so that I would most likely need surgery later on the other side to match. Ugh! I would definitely get at least two opinions with specifics for you with either surgery. And I recommended MRI if you haven't had one yet and have dense tissue. Good to be as sure as possible about what you're dealing with ahead of time. I hope you'll find a moment of clarity. This back and forth stuff sucks - neither choice is what we want to do.

His input - all of these treatment protocols are based on research studies. There's no way to know with certainty whether one individual needs 6 rounds or 9 or 12. They just go with what the studies showed. Same goes for dosing. The recommended dosages are based on the majority of people tolerating that dose. Majority could mean only 51%! That's a lot of people who don't tolerate it. They had to decrease my chemo by 25% after the first round because of scary SE's requiring hospitalization. Probably any chemo is better than none. Quality of life is important. I ended up completing my scheduled treatment because I didn't want to kick myself down the road if it came back. Your mother should discuss the options at that next appt. Perhaps they can make some changes. ",

If you are at all on the fence however - I would ask your MO for some help with the SE's. Zofran definitely causes constipation. I had problems with that from Compazine and then would have problems with diarrhea later. It became a balancing act of fluid and fiber and then Imodium. You shouldn't have to suffer with pain of any type. Ask for something. Lots of people take Claritin while on chemo to help with the bone pain sometimes caused by the WBC stimulators, too. And I had absolutely horrible gastritis and reflux - felt like my stomach was disinigrating - but the combination of Prilosec and Carafate made a huge difference within a few days. I'm so sorry that you've been feeling so bad. I know it's really hard and we're all different. Just thought I'd throw in some suggestions but support whatever choice you make for you. ",

The hair (80%) left around day 18-20. Keeping track of my SE's in a journal was helpful - I could prepare for the next time and look forward to when things got better.

I feel like cancer should be not very likely since I had a pCR, but I know there are no guarantees. I finished chemo in April 2017 and Herceptin in January 2018. I have not been on hormonal therapy because of concerning SE's and problems determining menopausal status. That worries me, but isn't really something I can control. I had an abdominal and pelvic CT in August as a follow up to some concerning endoscopy findings. The report does not mention tailbone or spine (was not for that). It does say it went to the pubic symphysis and says \"bone windows\" were normal. I guess I'll see what the doctor says tomorrow.",

It's possible that 4 rounds is enough for you, but that's not what was scientifically proven. I ended up completing what was ordered because I knew that I would be really hard on myself if I didn't and had a recurrence down the road. Of course - I still haven't started Tamoxifen due to my concerns about the benefit vs risk in my case. Talk to your MO about your concerns. Maybe they have other insight - a change in the dose or infusion rate, a new option for managing SE's, anything. But at the end of the day - it's your body that you're living with both now and for the rest of your life. You do get to choose. ",

I couldn't find the lump after the first round and I was worried about possible longterm effects. My MO's NP listened patiently to my concerns and offered some possibilities but mostly it was driven by me. I ended up switching to Neupogen shots - not as convenient but also didn't make my counts go sky high and didn't feel as bad. I started taking Imodium on a schedule instead of waiting for the diarrhea to hit, too. And mostly I just felt a little more in control, knowing that I could quit. I stuck it out. I knew that I would be angry with myself if I didn't finish and the cancer came back. But that's just me. There were certainly times that I worried that I was trading a cancer diagnosis for a lifetime of problems down the road. You should discuss your concerns with your MO. All of the components were decreased by 25% for me after the first disasterous round, too. The dosages were determined by studies where the majority of people could tolerate the amount. That means that maybe 49% couldn't! Also - I kept a journal of all of my SE's and that helped to plan for better and worse days. I found that I felt fairly normal the last few days to a week before the next round. I hope you can feel better soon! ",
