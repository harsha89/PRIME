    "Content": "loriniem1 wrote: I have had my mammorgrams and ultrasounds and demanded a biopsy which I'm hoping will eventuate in the very near future. My left nipple is significantly smaller than my right, it has the orange peel texture, burns like heck, a lump of some kind is definitely present, my hair is falling out by the fistful and I remain frustrated and terrified. HOWEVER, I am 43 yo and I'm guessing that perhaps I could be pre-menopausal which could explain a couple of my symptoms and concerns. However, I know my body and feeling the lump I have on my left breast, the excretion of this icky discharge in BOTH my breasts leaves me confused. Would it be a good idea to ask for a blood test before my biopsy. YES, I'm a total novice at all this and have no clue what I'm up against or the procedures to getting where I need to be for peace of mind. I read on this website that a bloodtest could help determine certain proteins cancer producing cells create so why should I wait for a biopsy? Why not go straight for the jugular and get a blood test? Wouldn't this save me and other people in the same boat alot of grief and anxiety? I hope someone can help me with this issue. In the meantime my strongest prayers are sent out to you all for your courage and I wish you all the very best. My prayers also to the families at the VA Tech. How tragic! What on earth is this country coming to? Strong prayers. Lori Log in to post a reply",
