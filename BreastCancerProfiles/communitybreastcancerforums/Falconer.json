I didn't have to push for it, but like many of you, it didn't show up on my mammo 2 months earlier. I'd been told I had dense breasts, but for that exam, the mammo must've \"sufficed\".. lucky for me I had bleeding out of my left nipple, and on self examination found a lump. My gyn ordered a mammo and US; the lump, 1.1 cm of IDC, only showed on the US. Makes me wonder what routine mammos are good for, as the 5cm of DCIS didn't show there either. Hope, like you I was in complete and utter disbelief. I bet we all were. Good luck with your waiting and let us know how it goes.",
