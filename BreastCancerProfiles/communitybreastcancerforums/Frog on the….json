Second Taxol coming up tomorrow. Inna B, I had really dry mouth on AC. I used to wake up multiple times at night due to this. I used Biotene mouth wash and I also got a gel that helped quite a bit. Its Oral Balance dry mouth moisturizing gel by Biotene. You can give that a try. Best wishes to all of you lovely ladies in here",

The thing with time sensitive jobs are that its not only about getting it done but getting it done by that specific time. You do not need that stress. I work as a technical recruiter and was between jobs when I found out. My whole day revolves around meeting Tech leads or interview candidates. There is no way I could have managed it. Imagine feeling nauseaus as the next candidate is waiting to see you and all you are looking for is a hole to climb into. Its fine, you are very brave as it is. Right now focus on getting better, feeling better. Its okay to take a few days off between infusions. Ingerp, your fur babies are so so cute.",

I finished ACT last week. Still struggling with SEs. Surgery in sept. You are strong women, each one of you, you can do it. Its okay to cry, shout and rant. Its okay to not get out of bed and its okay to ask for help. Ask questions, no questions are silly questions. Read up on some of the prev months threads, they give you a good idea about whats to come. Write notes about your SEs, they follow a pattern. Drink lots of water, keep eating, you need your strength. Talk to your MO or Onco nurses about any questions you have. Do not miss anti nausea meds. Stay off google and be kind to yourself. ",

Salads, fruit salads, toasted museli, crackers with any dip. My taste buds are doing better on Taxol, but still a long way off.

Taxol did not make me feel nauseaus and my acidity probs also subsided. I now take omeprazole on and off. Taste was back for the first few weeks, now both taste and appetite are gone. I feel Taxol effects are more cumulative. Since you will be on DD Taxol there will be somethings that will be different than the weekly ones, but hey you will be done 4 weeks earlier than us 12 weekly ladies.

I remember reading about the baking soda mouth wash in the folder they gave me. But with baking soda popping up everywhere for everything on google I think my brain just ignored it.. silly me. I wanted to add something in case someone finds it helpful. Both times with the AC infusion I had headaches. Thats because of the drip going in. ( I have a portacath). Check with your nurse and have some mild painkillers beforehand or ask them to slow down the drip. My onco nurses have been really nice and they try to help as much as they can. I took my neulesta shot yesterday, bit achy today. Food tastes off. I reach for the salt shaker more than I would like. My new favourites are olives. They taste good. I keep a banana on my bedstand to eat something as soon as I get up. Also, I have huge pimples, ones the 16 year old me had. Big angry pimples. I have a wig already, me and hubby picked it out. My kid did not like it, she said its the same as your normal hair, no one will know you got new hair. Where is the fun in that? She is six. We did get her a pink wig from the party store 😀. ",

I have not slept well between the knee pain and the cough. I hope they dont ask me to postpone due to the cough. Would they? One fourth of my eyebrow on the right side is gone. I draw my eyebrows right after I brush my teeth. Makes me feel normal. GA Warrior, Urdrago, Ingerp, I believe all three of you got your infusion on thursday. Hope the SEs are manageable. InnaB, only 1 more AC to go. Look at that. Life, that is a funny story. I dont wear the wig at home but I live in an apartment so not many people have seen me and my shiny head.

Also, my first 2 AC treatments, I was craving a lot of sugar. I do not like sweets, but ended up buying lots of sweets and icecreams, last 2 treatments, back to not liking sugar.

Okay, about what kept me away last week. So much has happenned in the last ten days. I did not get a drain for my lumpectomy. I had major bruising that has subsided quite nicely. Results came in, did not get a PCR, but , there has been a good response on the cancer and the BS has taken everything out. We had clear margins and no node involvement. Now since there was a bit of residual, MO asked me to take chemo pills (Capecitabine) after I finish radiation. It will take me to April by the time I am done with those. And it has its own set of SEs. So, yeah, that all happenned. I have FUZZ. I am so excited. And I have fuzz everywhere ( not so excited about that).

Urdrago, what I understood from RO was boosts are targeted towards the area where the lump was. During lumpectomy, the surgeon takes the lump and some normal surrounding tissues out and put a few more titaniom clips around to mark the area. The boosts are targeted to this area based on the clips and are also given more closer to the skin. Its more localized to the tumor site is what I understand. Thinking of you as you go in for surgery on friday. I took sleeping pills couple of nights leading up to the surgery date. It was getting too much. InnaB, did you get your dates yet? My RO said they will put a silicone covering called Mepitel that stays on through showers and will be changed when it gets frayed. So, I do not have to use any cream on the breast.

I feel the zoladex shot was the main culprit. My next Zoladex is on the day I take my 12th Taxol. That week will kick my behind. We will see when I get to that. So, I met my BS today and am equal parts informed and confused. And believe it or not my worry is around radiation. It seems radiation is bit risky on the left side. I feel like I should meet up with the RO before I make any decisions regarding mastectomy or partial mastectomy. She did mention 1 interesting thing. Use of any opioid type of painkiller after surgery for pain management is controversial as there are some studies coming up that say they might lead to mets. I will have an MRI couple of weeks after I finish chemo and we will take it from there. She wants me to keep my port in until after the surgery and path results on the off chance that the report on the tumor comes back Her2+. This was the first I heard of this. My BS mentioned its rare but has happenned. All the best to all you lovely ladies and Engine. Edit: Surgery dates will be around 6 th sept or 13 th sep",

Christmas here is barbeques, shorts and beaches. I think I will have to miss out on all the beach activities as my skin has become super sensitive to sun on Xeloda. None of the other SEs are bothering me much, yet. Anyways we are never in NZ for Christmas. Thats the time for our annual trip to visit family and friends. And my MO okayed me for the trip as Xeloda is pills and I can continue while holidaying with family. Ingerp, thats a lovely pic, you look great. We are still house hunting. Like one a lot, lets see.

Urdrago, love your furbaby, what a cute dp. There are 2 incisions, one for lymph nodes in the underarms and the second one on the breast. Also, a third one if you count the portacath. All the best for your pre surgery consultation. I got flushots before I started chemo and so did hubby and my kid. Check with your GP on if or when you can get them. The flu shots contains weakened or inactivated form of the influenza virus. Now after chemo our immunity is compromised. I do not know if they would want to introduce any kind of virus in us just now. Take care everyone.",

Urdrago, hugs to you. So happy for you. I went through a very overwhelming last 2 weeks. Last year's diagnosis dates and then went back last week for yearly US and Mammogram. Followed by the visit with BS. I was such a wreck. It was the same clinic, and the dates were apart by a day from last year. I kept on going through that day last year and tearing up. I am one of those people who associate memories with dates. I remember exactly how things had happenned, the whole sequence of it. Ughghgh.... Last year they gave me a file to carry to the BS, this year I got a single sheet for a report with two smiley faces on them, one for each breast.😀😀. On cycle 7 for Xeloda. Quite tired. Have some ongoing pains and aches. I dont know how you guys kept working through last year. Have started dropping things again, I might have mentioned this before. So MO has asked to stop Xeloda whenever I feel like. I am trying to push myself through it. Also, I cannot sleep until maybe 2 am, so am groggy and grumpy the whole day. I am hoping things will change once I am done with Xeloda. Its quite strong. I dont know why I thought that it will be easy since its pills. Its easier than AC and Taxol, no doubt about that. But still Ingerp, how was the vacation? Hope everyone is having a good week.",

Thats some good arm movement you have after the axillary dissection. My paths came back in 8 days. But it will also depend on howmuch work they have at the labs. All the best for your path results. Today was the 6th day of radiation. Breast feels a bit sore. I do not need to use any cream or anything because of the Mepitel they have put. Its a film of silicone which covers the whole breast barring the nipple. Nipple is quite sore. I got a foam patch for it today. I will need to remove it during shower and treatments. The Mepitels stays on. I do feel tired, but then I have a bad cough so am not sleeping very well. I was freaked out about coughing on the radiation table. Thankfully, I have been able to control the urge. Also, I use a clove as a cough logenze and it works much better if you ask me and are okay with the taste. Just keep it in your mouth and bite on it when you feel the cough coming. When I had a PET CT way back in April they found a nodule on my thyroid. My Oncologist assured me that its probably nothing and even if it was the breast takes precedence. So I believed her( did not have much choice) and put that on the back burner. Well, I had the thyroid biopsy done last tuesday and heard back yesterday, its benign. So relieved. Also, thyroid biopsy is no joke. Its way worse than the breast biopsies. Its a fine needle one not like the core biopsies we had for the breast and still, worse. Was not doing very well coping with the biopsy and waiting for the results. Was very sensitive and anxious DebAl thats a beautiful picture. Engine, that looks yummy. I am not much into sweets but since starting radiation I have been craving icecream. I have a big bowl every night with lots of fruit in it. Ingerp, you still into desserts? I remember you loved your desserts while on chemo. Stay well everyone.",

If I want to do something, I try to do it most of the times. Pre 2018, I would think of all the ways things could go wrong and look out for them to avoid or rectify even before they happened. Guess what, things still go wrong. Not much point stressing. In regards to Zometa, GA warrior makes a good point. The jaw necrosis thing is serious. Also my MO said that it is only helpful for menopausal women and for hormone receptor positive cases. I have a link somewhere will try to find it and post. I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend.

I did not see an Opthalmologist, just my regular Optiometerist. She gave me an over the counter ointment. It has really helped. My vision has cleared up a lot.  Urdrago, congratulations.

Life, I hope you are doing fine. I remember you mentioning in a previous post that you got your diagnosis last year on the 28th. I will start my round 3 on Xeloda tommorrow. Also, I will meet my parents tomorrow after a year. I need to remember to take my sleep meds tonite, I am not sleeping well due to anxiety. So far Xeloda has been manageable. Lots of skin itching I was more than happy when my MO said I could travel and also continue on the meds. We had a stopover in Singapore and my skin itched and crawled the whole time I was outdoors. It was quite humid and hot for december. I am so glad I am doing the trip in winter. Imagine, me an Indian by birth, cannot take hot and humid🙄🤣. Wishing everyone of us a very uneventful 2019.",

Urdrago, how are you holding up on Xeloda? Do remember to drink lots of water and have protein with your breakfast and dinner, something about Xeloda SEs not being that harsh if they have protein cells to bind to in the stomach. I will try to look up that link and send it to you. I feel quite dry inside and out. Also my lips blister and crack on Xeloda, not a good look, its not painful or anything. Have turned quite dark, again, this happenned on Taxol as well. I have some skin toxicity but its at level 1. My doc keeps reminding me that I am still on chemo and to have realistic expectations from my body. I have been quite tired for the last few days. Staring at the laptop for 3-4 hours everyday is making eyes drier. It helps that I chose my own hours. I cannot help but think how you, Robin, DebAl, Janice and all the ladies that kept working through appointments, SEs last year through this journey. You guys are such great inspiration. Robin, good to know you are doung fine after the surgery. My dad is fine. His doc told him not to worry and that its quite common to have some malignancy in the prostate at his age. He is back to being himself mostly. Has agreed to let go of some of the crazy stuff like lugging heavy things or getting on ladders. Anyone tried mindfullness before. I tried it on and off last year. It seems to help some of the anxiety and general well being Keep well everyone.",

And it was taking all I had to not feel depressed and then this happenned. I have felt so mad, sad and helpless. One thing I have to say, I commend the way NZers are dealing with it. Everyone smiles more, acknowledges each other. I feel people are just trying to be kinder towards each other to prove to ourselves that we are in this together, whoever you are, you are loved. Atleast thats how I felt today at my kid's school and at the mall. I am in Auckland and the shooting happenned in Christchurch. My kid's 2nd grade teacher lost her cousin in the shooting. She was a huge support through out last year when I was going through all this. Urdrago, belated birthday wishes. Hope you are feeling okay after the reaction you had on Xeloda. Robin, go you. You are a celebrity. I recently started going to a support group for people who have finished treatment in the last year. Its been quite helpful. InnaB, congrats, cant wait to read it. I have been trying to make a routine around excercises but have failed miserably. My feet are getting quite sore with Capecitabine. Also, I have been dropping things... sounds familiar. I like your idea around yoga and pilates, thanks, I will look into it. I love the part that people in the group are making travel plans. What a year it was. We deserve the break. So do our loved ones who supported us through those times. I have missed the last 2 classes of belly dancing. Its quite fun though. Somehow the teachers there have taught their luscious hair to move with the sensuos beats.... grrrrr, mine is like a bush bobbing up and down. Its so unruly, but its mine, so I am not complaining.😊  Take care ladies and Engine.",

GA Warrior, what I understand from my MO about the Taxol is some people prefer the DD Taxol every 2 weeks X 4 because that way they finish their treatments 4 weeks earlier. ( I can see the temptation). However, 12 weekly Taxol means lesser issues with the SEs or more manageable SEs. Infact my MO said I will not get any neulesta shots during weekly Taxol as it does not wreck as much havoc on your WBCs as DD AC or DD Taxol or Taxol + Carboplatin. My doc has not advised any supplements like B vitamins, I will check with the nurse. I am not sure about the SEs though. Some of you guys have been having a rough time. MO says Taxol will be easy after DD AC. We will see. Someone mentioned sore nail beds. Yes, I have 3 and I am not even on Taxol yet. I can imagine what lies ahead when Taxol starts. Both thumbs and the right middle finger are turning black and are sore. I have noticed if I keep my nails very short they hurt less. The MO nurse suggested soaking them in water mixed with white vinegar or tea tree oil to keep them free from infection. Time to hit the pharmacy again in prep for Taxol. Something new that has been bothering me is I feel there is a lump in my throat all the time. Acid reflux maybe. Need to check with the nurse. I feel like such a whiner. Dee, I took screenshots of your Taxol experience that you so patiently must have typed out for me, thankyou.",

I have some pain in my back, the nurses did mention that might happen and to just take some over the counter painkillers. GA Warrior, no I did not ice my hands or feet. My clinic did not offer it and I do not know if I could have taken it. MO said the numbing and the tingling is more cumulative so we will see it as we progress. She mentioned its at its worse around 2 or 3 weeks after treatment stops. I do have sore nailbeds one thumb and one index finger. Apparently soaking them in epsom salt water helps. I read it somewhere in this lovely board. Going to try it tonight. The nurses mentioned to soak in water with tea tree oil or white vinegar to deter any infection and make sure that your nails and underneath the nails are really dry, no moisture. Lot of Dex still in the system. My sparking bedroom is proof to that. Nurse said I will crash sometime tomorrow as the steroids leave the system. Its sunny outside and I plan to walk to pick my kid from school. It feels good to be outside though the temp has fallen to 4 degrees C. I figured that I found the smell of the saline or whatever they use to flush the port really offensive. Chewed some soft ginger candies through it and was fine. It seems next infusion there will be no steroids, only ranitidine and loratidine. If body tolerates it well then nothing at all from the third infusion. Lady on my left yesterday told me she had a reaction on her second infusion, but the nurses took care of it and she was all fine and chatty so that was good. Lady on right had had a severe allergic reaction to Taxol so any Taxol or Taxotore is out for her. She is on carboplation. I hate this disease. As if us going through it and the SEs and all the pain and worry that comes with it is not enough, now this lady does not have the choice to take this medicine. I so hate it. My mouth and throat are really dry. Time to do the wash again. I have a dry cough. MO said no infection, chemo might be doing it. Also, I get a bit tired if I am walking uphill. MO asked me to keep her updated if it gets worse. Heres hoping lots of uneventful days for all of us.",

Good to know your infusion went well and you are feeling good. Dee, I know what you mean with weekly Taxol. With every infusion I fear the cumulative effects. Going in for number 3 on monday. No premeds or steroids this time....eee GA Warrior, I am using the same one that Inna B mentioned the OPI Nail strengthener. I dry them thoroughly after washing my hands. I gently push back the cuticles. Also, I keep the nails super short. In regards to food I like things which have a lot of crunch like salads and ....fruit salads. Urdrago, Yayy on getting to the halfway mark, right there with you. Wishing you a quiet restful weekend. This is a link I found on the forum some time back. I liked the tips on it. I hope the link works.https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/6/topics/818139?page=2#post_5207555 Maggie, almost there. One more to go for you. Have a good weekend everyone. Edited: Anybody has pain on the portacath side radiating towards chest and underarm. I might have been overdoing things around the house. Or is it from the Taxol? Anyone else",

Life, till now the nail info I have gathered is from the MO, the Oncology nurses and this link below: 1. Use OPI nail strengthener nail paint. 2.Keep your hands/ nails dry of any moisture 3.Use 1 part vinegar 2 part water for nailbed soreness and to ward of infection. You can aso use few drops of tree tea oil in water and soak your fingers in that. 4. You can also soak in epsom salt water for sore nail beds. Note: I have tried both epsom salts and vinegar, vinegar worked better for me. 5. Use dark nail paints as Taxol makes nails sensitive to sunlight. 6. Keep nails short. 7. Apply heavy moisturizer on hands and nails. My MO told me to apply oil on nails, any kind, even olive oil is fine. I hope this helps. Whats with the nose drip.. so annoying and embarrassing at times. Maybe I should wear a mask just so that nobody sees me dripping like a 3 year old who doesn't care. Inna B, lol, I buzzed off my hair after the 2nd AC, its been 2 months now with no hair. My hubby has said more than once that now that I look like a buddhist monk I should maybe start acting like one. Well, that was on AC. I was a bit more irritable on AC. Duffyzmom, Dee and Mdevroy congrats on getting to the end of the chemo journey. Mdevroy, havent seen you much since the very early days since the thread started. Good to know you are doing good. Notered and GA Warrior, all the best to you guys as you move on to part 2 of chemo. Urdrago, hope you have a good week with Taxol 4. Have a restful week ladies.",

Too much of tylenol can lead to liver toxicity thats why they ask to stick within 4000 mg in 24 hours. Less if you also have alcohol. Taxol leads to liver toxicity. I try to alternate between paracetamol and ibuprofen. Also, Ibuprofen is not good for people with asthma or wheezing problems just to keep in mind Thank you for all the suggestions on eyebrows.

In other news, the numbness/ pain in my fingers have gotten worse, infact typing has become quite painful as well. MO said for the last 2 infusions, I will get a lower dose. I asked about efficacy and she said that we get 99% of the benefits in the early weeks. The last 3 weeks are just a top up. I am sorry if I have missed someone. You all are in my thoughts.",

      "Content": "Apr 24, 2018 07:30AM - edited Apr 24, 2018 07:42AM by Frog-on-the-lilypad Hello ladies, Lots of good info in the messages above. Thank you all for sharing. I was super tired this time as compared to the first infusion. I count infusion day as Day 1. Then I have the neulesta shot 24 hours after the infusion. I had an appointment with my MO yesterday out of turn, as she will be out of town next week when I have my 3rd AC. Couple of things we found out in regards to SEs. My thumb nail and tounge are turning darker. My MO mentioned that generally people with darker skin tones will see these changes more. So if you tan easily you will see your nails, tounge even skin darkening with both chemo and radiation. She asked me to put some oil around the nailbeds at night and put on some nailpaint. If you have taken Zoladex you will have break through spotting for few days. (More than few days, in my case). Neulesta will make you feel achy and tired. Take mild painkillers and sleep through it😀, is what I did. I was sensitive to noise for the first few days and have ringing in my ears from time to time. I was more bothered about the sensitivity to noise and that went away after the 4th day. MO said the next MRI/US will be after I finish chemo until then they gauge changes by feel. She feels the tumor has softened. She also used a tape to measure. The first time the measurements she wrote were way more than what the scans say. MO says thats because when she measures by tape there is breast tissue and swelling from biopsy/ titanium clip placement. This time she said the tumor feels softer and the measurements were much lower than last time. I do not know whether its the chemo working or if its because the inflammation from biopsy/ clip placement going down. I sure want it to be the first one😀. ElizB, I hope you feel better soon. It is frustrating. As for putting the dx you need to click on My Profile on the top right corner, it will open youu profile page whereyou will see 4 tabs. You can update your diagnosis and treatments under the specified tabs My Diagnosis and My Treatment. Hugs to all of you. 🤗   ",

Thanks GA Warrior, how are you holding up re the ear ringing. Deb, I was really achy after the shot infact the whole of last week was bad. This week has been much better. I was not getting much excercise but managed to get out yesterday for some light walking. Temperatures have started falling on this side of the earth. I am kind of dreading the flu season with the upcoming winter and a 6 year old. We did get the flu shots before I started chemo. Good tips on constipation. I intend to scroll up and write down all the tips mentioned in the messages above. I am trying to get some red meat in my diet to up iron levels to help with the RBC. Gearing up for AC 3 on monday. Stay well everyone",

Duffyzmom, I picked up something from the pharmacy Biotene, dry mouth relief oral balance Mouisturising gel, helps soothe and protect oral tissue ( says on the box). Maybe you can give it a try. I have not used it yet. But I intend to after the next round. Now, about metal mouth. Funny story here. I have a few lovely friends who send me dinner/lunch the first 3 nights after infusion. Today I decided I should make something for them as a thank you, also, I love to cook. So I made a huggge pot of whatever it is, cause I cannot figure out how it tastes. And my sense of smell is very sensitive. So you see I smell all the spices 3 times over and taste porridge. I hate porridge. Poor husband has tasted it at 7 different stages and has assured me that its good but I am not convinced.... at all. Have a lovely weekend ladies.",

I can hear every drip, creak, everything plus the ears ringing. I had a full day today, got the neulesta shots and the Zoleda implans. Went for the genetic testing consultation. I am so done.

That could also be because I had freaked myself out by reading substandard research on google the night before infusion. DebAl, yayyyy for you. Take care of yourself and take it easy. Life, thank you, I was thinking of nicknames and my kid came and asked me to draw her a frog on the lilypad, I liked the way she said it and thats how the nickname. About nails, please keep them really dry, after a bath. Also, you can soak them in vinegar water or add few drops of tea tree oil in water. This is to keep infections away. Then moisturize like DebAl suggested. I do hope your nail does not add to the list of SEs. My nails are growing really slow and have become very hard. My hands are really dry as well. I do not know if its the chemo or its me washing my hands like a germaphobe every hour. Yes, the portacath pain had me worried. Also, for the last three times they had to prick me twice to get blood. I feel like a pin cushion. I can still feel some soreness 24 hours after the infusion. I have really enjoyed soda. I had it after ages and I could taste something.

They do put lots of local anasthesia, I did not feel much, but, at one point there was a wire like a radio antennae poking straight out of my left breast. The radiologist took fancy sterile pliers and turned it 90 degrees to get it parallel to skin. Added lots of padding on top and off I walked to the hospital for surgery. Two different buildings.

Do look after yourself as well. You and Linda look lovely. Let me know when you plan to visit NZ 😀. Ingerp, that cracked me up. Life, I hope it went easy. Urdrago, how goes the rads? Rest up this holiday season with your fur baby. Thats a beautiful dp. Wishing you minimal fatigue. You mentioned a rash in a previous post, how are you doing with that? My radiation nurse suggested to make a paste of baking soda and water to apply on any itchy areas and then wipe away. It takes away the itch. I do not know if its okay on broken skin though. Well, I never had any itching during radiation. Now on Xeloda I itch like mad. Everytime I am out in the sun I have this intense prickling feeling under the skin. Thankfully it subsides after a minute or two under the shade. So, my kid turned 7 this week and we had a beach party. The whole duration I stayed under a big shady tree, did not join in in any water or sand play. But, I was glad that I was there for the party and that I had the strength and energy to organize and pull it off. Grateful to have what I have. I am nearing the end of the second cycle on Xeloda. So far I have had that itching thing, scaly dry patches on skin which go away on the off week, face looks quite tanned though I am very dilligent with the sun screen. My blood works are all normal, not taken much of a dip yet. I do have some serious corneal dryness. During chemo, vision in both the eyes were blurry and it took me some time to adjust between near and far. Now the left one has bounced back. The right eye not so much. And its also quite sensitive to bright lights. So I do not feel quite confident driving. Anyways, I got that looked into and am on some meds for that now. I feel quite sorry for what our bodies had to endure in the past year. Also, we did not get the house. But I had some major fun at the auction. This was my first auction. Sending you all lots of cheer for the holidays",

They did give me some saline. Then Taxol, they did it really slow for the first 15 mins and had a box of allergy meds at my station just in case. One thing I notice different from AC or the first Taxol is my mouth has this bitter taste. Its not dry yet but will get there, I can tell. Also, I did not like going back to the clinic again in a weeks time. My eyebrows are still there, have thinned a bit. My nails are getting a bit darker so are my palms. The only upside, my face is so smooth, no downy facial hair. In the early days when I had just got diagnosed, I used to think about how wonderful it would be if I could just wake up from this horrible nightmare. This feeling lasted until chemo started. Till the exact minute chem started, I kept on telling myself, wake up, now would be a good time to wake up and not actually go through this. Ha ha ha, I wish.",

Also, I read an article which says people undergoing weekly Taxol have more issues with nails. Taxol weekly makes nails sensitive to UVA and UVB. Its a good idea to paint them with dark colours to protect from sun damage. Eyebrows and eye lashes have thinned quite a bit. I am hiding under the fake bangs. 8 more to go.

Sending you lots of positive vibes. GAWarrior, have a chat with your MO in reg to reduced dose. I do not know how I would have managed if I was on full dose with the state my fingers were in. Also, in your profession you do need to use your fingers a lot. After 3 days of anti biotics and the initial incision, today my thumb feels okay, as in no throbbing pain. And its not as swillen. I do have numb fingers. My GP said to give 4 to 6 weeks before feeling close to normal. No fuzzies yet. Maybe 14 eyebrows in all. I met up with a doc on my GP\u2019s recommendation for dietary/ lifestyle choices. She mentioned that broccoli, brocolli sprouts and other cruciferous veggies are really good. To follow a plant based diet and the meat should be a side rather than main. She was not very keen on dairy products either. Infact she asked me to check out almond milk or some other nut milks. She said yes to tofu but not to soy milk. Nuts like brazil nuts, almonds and cashews are good. Making sure to drink enough water and fibre to have a smooth running system. She said some of us cannot get rid of toxins as well as others, so A: Don\u2019t add too many toxins and B: Make sure that your system removes as much and there is no backlog. Seems our bodies reabsorb a lot of stuff from the guts so the more waste backlog you have the more we are reabsorbing. So keep it moving. She asked me to take some turmeric capsules but only after I am done with surgery. Turmeric has blood thinning properties so maybe thats why she asked to wait after surgery. Stay well everyone. ",

We were house hunting when this hit and had put that on the back burner. He says we have waited enough. I am not able to feel as excited as I should be. We dont know a thing about buying a house.

Random isolated pain in the radiated area and skin changes. But its okay. I also got the go ahead to go swimming in pools. Looking forward to that. Its getting warmer here. Blue skies. I woke up with a head of unruly hair. So glad my hair has the length to be unruly now. I start Capecitabine next monday. Hoping to get by with minimal SEs",

And frankly I wish I was online more and reading these messages than hiding in a hole that I did for the last week. For one I kept on waiting for the Xeloda SEs which haven't hit yet. Then I heard its cumulative, so maybe around end of Week 2. Also, now that my energy levels are back and I kind of look like myself, I get scared of what now. It started out well, I have been running around with my kid, taking her to the park, looking at houses, sorting out things, getting my CV updated and then it creeps in. Whenever I feel like myself, the old me, I remember that the sneaky bastard was in me and I had no clue. Anyways, I think I am out of that funk.... for now. Urdrago, thats a beautiful winter pic. Energy wise, you will feel a bit low at certain times in a day but then when you dont you almost feel like old times, if that makes sense. My skin is peeling and there is new skin underneath. I am still using a pad on the nipple as its quite sensitive. Hairtalk, looove the hair pics. Urdrago, beautiful hair color. Life and DebAl, you guys look like its an intentional hair do. Very modern. I recently had a lady compliment me on my hairstyle. She said she loved how it brings out all the features on your face and she loved how iteresting and different it looked in a good way ( her daughter has just shaved her head and she was loving her daughter's new hair style). Anyways, it felt good. InnaB, I was rocking the duckling look on 18 th of Oct and below is a pic from 18th Nov. The hair took off in that month. Take care everyone ",

I got back last week but was so jet lagged and then with school starting, it was too much. Last year this time I was back in India trying to support my sister and parents, little did I know that in a month my life would change. That has been on my mind a lot as well. Trip was good. Both sets of parents were happy to see us, they were happier when we told them about our plans to buy a new house. I guess, they feel better when they see me making plans for the future. I wish I could feel upbeat about it as much as everyone else. Dad had an elective prostrate surgery while we were there. The biopsy came back positive for adeno carcinoma. The doc mentioned that at his age (80), some 70% guys have malignant cells in the prostrate. I think this fact freaked out my hubby more than my dad. Anyways, no meds or anything for him. He needs to get his PSA levels checked regularly. He has recovered fine from the surgery and is back to his garden and writing. So much has happenned in the group meanwhile. First of, Urdrago, thank you for that poster. I commend the hard work 😜 you put in for this. I am so sorry you are having such a hard time on Xeloda. My MO mentioned that a lot of people underestimate it as its pills. Is your MO thinking of reducing the dose? If you look into the xeloda threads, there are two in bco, one under the chemo topic another one under TNBC topic, you will see ladies who have been put on reduced doses or on one week on one week off cycles. I started round 5 on monday. I am tired the whole day. I am doing all the household work but its like even when I wake up after a good nights sleep I am aching. Also, my hands and feet look like I sleep on the streets Robin, so good to know that Bryce is doing well and your Mohs went fine. Debal, how are enjoying your new job? Linda, I am so sorry for your loss. Sending you warm hugs. Engine, I am so glad that Janice is recovering well. Gosh, what a nightmare. Ingerp, InnaB, Life, Maggie, Duffyzmom, Batata, hope you guys are doing good. I am sorry if I missed anyone.",

Inna B, get ready for curls dear, they are coming your way🤣. I will be starting round 6 of Xeloda tomorrow. A bit more achy and tired than before. MO said she wants me to do all 8 rounds. LINDA, what a relief. I cannot believe what you went through. My diagnosis date is coming up and I find myself thinking about all the little incidents that happenned before that. I found the lump on the 10th of march, met my BS on 16th who mentioned thrice that she was\u201dvery concerned\u201d after the mammogram and ultrasound. And on 23rd March we knew for sure. Last time I went to see her in Dec before the trip, she booked me in on the ultrasound and mammogram on the very same week I found out last year. I am trying to keep myself cool 🤣🤣not happenning and collected( this I am trying to be). I dont know why we chose the same dates though. So I was trying to house hunt and keep all these thoughts at bay. Now, due to us being naive kids while buying houses we got into some process loop hole that everyone else knew about and we lost the house inspite of being the higgest bidders. Waaaaaaaa. And all the house available right now are, well , we dont like them. So, that also explains me being MIA. Also, I joined a belly dance class. I am very excited about it as this is something I wanted to do and do it only for myself. Also, because, after one full year on Zoladex injections, my stomach is so bloated, I look pregnant. I have a few friends who are pregnant with their second ones and that makes me feel a bit mad/sad too for us. I feel I have been trying to just collect things to feel rotten about. Now, the good things, I am still holding okay on Xeloda. I got offered a work from home job for 3 months. Its 4 hours everyday and I chose the hours, so thats some good news. I do not feel like I will be able to do, that is a totally different story😬. Also, eyebrows and hair is back in all their curly glory. I have this huge halo of hair around me in the morning. I should take a picture. Robin, so glad your surgery went well. How is Bryce doing? Urdrago, your niece looks adorable, you cracked me up with your hair comment. Seems a lot of us are nearing our diagnosis dates. Dleon, I wish you lots of strength, love and good friends ( includes online friends, they are the best). Drink lots of water, get a port, it works, inspite of them never getting mine in on the first try.Take some hard ginger candies with you to take the taste of the meds off. Treat yourself kindly. Body wants to rest , you go rest. I lost my hair after the second AC, mine was every 2 weeks. Read up on the first few pages of this thread there will be some pretty amazing info there. And as Ingerp mentioned be a part of March 2019 and support each other across continents. Ingerp, I still have achy boobs from the radiation. MO said some people feel it for a year or more. It should start feeling better from 6 month onwards.",

We are planning a trip to Europe, I am very excited. I hope to get some energy back before the trip which I think will be quite soon. Hubby is going for a conference and I am tagging along. My MO thinks my body has been pushed into a pre menopausal state. That is supposed to explain the fatigue and yet sleepless nights. We are still to find our \u201cdream house\" or even a regular house. My eyebrows are very thin, eyelashes not yet to pre chemo length. However, my hair has come back thicker and very fuzzy, frizzy. I had really straight hair and I have never owned a straightener. I have no idea what to do with this hair. I like it just because its mine. It does give me an additional 2 inches of height. I like that part as well.🤣. Robin, isnt your birthday coming up? Cant wait to see what Udrago posts for you. Urdrago, when do you get the results? I hope you and Deb Al have \u201cunremarkable\" written all over your results. Edited for multiple typos. ",

Boro girl, I wish I had read your account before going in. The wire they used was not as thin but there was lots of local anaesthesia involved The docs use two methods to find the sentinel nodes, one is the blue dye which is injected under anaesthesia, the other one is the radio isotope dye which travels really slow so has to administered a day before. It was not bad. I had to get the hookwire placed while seated on a throne with my breast jammed into those mammogram machine plates. They do put lots of local anasthesia, I did not feel much, but, at one point there was a wire like a radio antennae poking straight out of my left breast. The radiologist took fancy sterile pliers and turned it 90 degrees to get it parallel to skin. Added lots of padding on top and off I walked to the hospital for surgery. Two different buildings. I did like the walk as I bumped into my surgeon walking to the hospital for my surgery. Best wishes everyone.",

I got a foam patch for it today. I will need to remove it during shower and treatments. The Mepitels stays on. I do feel tired, but then I have a bad cough so am not sleeping very well. I was freaked out about coughing on the radiation table. Thankfully, I have been able to control the urge. Also, I use a clove as a cough logenze and it works much better if you ask me and are okay with the taste. Just keep it in your mouth and bite on it when you feel the cough coming. Sorry if anyone from the April chemogroup is reading this as this is a repeat of what I posted there. I do have some nausea. It was worse on the first day so no one thinks its because of the radiation. My breast feels heavy and my nipple is sore. Do you ladies see your RO in between treatments as well? I think I will see her only once during treatment and that too near the end. I do see the nurses every week and also the Senior Radiation Therapist. Wishing everyone minimal SEs.",

So 4 AC every 2 weeks followed by 4 Taxol every 2 weeks. The first week after you take AC is going to be all sorts of yuck. Take your nausea meds on time. Do not skip or try to brave it. Just take your meds and wait for day 6. Day 6 evening is from when I would start feeling human again. By day 8 life seemed close to normal (the new normal), I could be a productive member of the family. Be kind to yourself. Drink lots of fluid and wait for day 6. It follows a very set pattern. Some of the SEs became more pronounced as I went into cycles 3 and 4, like dry mouth and acidity. Some of the SEs like ear ringing were gone I am on weekly Taxol, so I cannot say much about how DD Taxol will be. For starters you will be done with 8 weeks and I have to do 12 weeks. Weekly Taxol is better tolerated as it is divided in 12. That being said, I have not taken any nausea meds on Taxol. There was not much downtime on Taxol when I started. However, now as I go in for Taxol 9, I can feel that I do not have as much energy as before. Taxol had its own set of SEs. For now focus on getting AC done. If I can do it, so can you.

The radiation is given in bursts of 20 seconds when I will have to do the breath hold. I am getting radiated on my left side. RO said not everybody benefits from the breath hold technique. Its a good idea to practice the breath hold lying down with arms stretched over your head specially as the incision under the arms might make staying in that position uncomfortable for long periods of time.

I was in the clinic for 45 minutes. Sidalee, does the mepitel cover your nipple as well? It doesnt for me and I am concerned about how the radiation will affect it. Thanks Ingerp, breath hold was not that bad.",

Linda, I wish more people were using Mepitel. Till now my skin looks okay, looks bit dark. The aereola that is not covered with Mepitel, thats the only part which is super sensitive and super dry and flaky ( sorry TMI). I wish that was covered as well. Mepitel seems to be the standard of care in NZ. Today was day 11/20 rads. Take care everyone",

Also to all the other ladies who are done with radiation. Yesterday was my last rad. Done with radiation. I have my next appointment with RO in 6 weeks. Have pain on and off on the boost site. My radiation nurse told me to apply a thin paste of baking powder and water, keep it for few mins and then wipe it off in case of itching. I do not have much itching so I have not tried it yet All the best ladies. I believe the Nov group is for ladies starting in Nov",

I have supportive friends and my DH has been a rock through this, but, this is the only place where I feel I can let off some steam and people will understand. I am going in for the radio isotope injection today evening, its 5th morning in NZ now. Read and got freaked out about it. There are 3 or 4 small injections around the aereola. Ouch, it hurts to even write that sentence. Planning to put emla cream, big thick layer in the hopes of numbing the sting. Then hookwire tomorrow at 8 and surgery at 10. I am not dealing with it... at all. I have not packed a thing. One day at a time is my motto right now. Today is showing up for the injection. Tomorrow is a different day.",

I am 1 week past radiation. Fatigue is getting better. Thankyou Palesa and Green Harbour for sharing your experience. Right now my left breast looks quite batterred.

      "Content": "Oct 24, 2018 03:56PM - edited Oct 24, 2018 03:59PM by Frog-on-the-lilypad Yellow B, good on you for starting this thread. I used to read up on previous month's thread to understand AC SEs. What I found different between AC and Taxol is Taxol is cumulative, the first 5 weeks on Taxol I hardly felt anything. Maybe some random aches. The thing I found with AC was its very predictable. It follows a set pattern, atleast it did for me all 4 DD cycles. I stopped taking the steroids from cycle 2 as I did not like the wide awake and jumpy state I used to be in. Drink lots of water. Add a squirt of lemon juice or orange to make water tolerable. Use plastic cutlery if the metallic taste feels too much. I used to have food which had lots of texture as I couldn't taste much. I had a huge craving for olives and ice lollies which just vanished with Taxol. Practice good hand hygeine. Avoid closed crowded spaces, you dont want to catch something as your immune system is quite compromised. You will feel quite okay from Day 6 onwards. So one bad week followed by a good week. On the day of the infusion, drink lots of water. Maybe keep a ginger candy in your mouth, I did as I did not like the taste of saline when they flushed my port. If you have a headache during your infusion tell the nurses to slow the drip it helps with the headache. You can take a painkiller beforehand as well. Also, use an emla cream to numb the port area. My port worked fine for the 4 DD AC and 9 weekly Taxol. After that there were some issues with it so we went through the veins. Take your anti nausea meds beforehand. Alternate between Biotene mouthwas and baking soda rinse every 6 hours. Biotene also has a dry mouth gel, I found it really helpful at nights as I would wake up parched every couple of hours. Use a soft toothbrush and be gentle. Earringing is a thing. Ear muffs help. I lost my hair after the second cycle. It just started coming off. I would run my fingers through it and there would be .... oh wow..I had forgotten how that felt. Well, on a positive note, my hair is coming back so are my lashes and eyebrows. Its slowly filling in. This saturday I shaved my legs after 7 months. I had surgery 3 weeks after finishing chemo and now am undergoing rads.I hope this helps someone out there. Happy to answer if anyone has any more questions Lastly ladies, be kind to yourself. You can do it.",
