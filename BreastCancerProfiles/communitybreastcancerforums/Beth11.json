I still can't believe it and just want to survive, that's my only real goal as I listen to my son talking upstairs getting ready for school, such a love, as I know all other women's children are to them. I will keep the women and men on this site in my prayers such a unique community. Thanks again. Beth",

I really have lost the words to describe my emotions but have a strong faith and know I can only do so much, I'm already tired of it and it's been five days, don't laugh too hard, I know that I'm in for a long road. I will say I'm a more relaxed person and drive much slower now, probably in a daze. Ha! Well, thank you for your advise and wishes and back at ya, I also appreciate your thoughts on this site. Any other info. You might care to share I'm all ears. Thank you, Beth",

I wanted to ask if anyone can tell me about Yale New Have Hospital? Yale is about 45 min away from our home and I really don't know what to expect as far as traveling and pain post surgery, how often do i go back and fourth? I have an MRI this week and am so afraid of cancer in my nodes! I can't believe I'm on this site and just want to cry, I have a six year old and am 44. My other question is the name Elizabeth Brady, are their two people with the same name in Ct. I looked on line and the two women I see look very different. I appreciate the opportunity to ask others like me these questions, I'm feeling lost and will take any info that I can get. Thank you very much.",
