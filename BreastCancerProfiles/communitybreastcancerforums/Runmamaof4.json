I am signed up for a 14 mile run in the city of Chicago on Saturday, the Polar Dash. I just can't see myself giving up on it and not running it but I'll have to see how sore I am after the biopsy. Good luck with your decision and some people will think you're strange out there but running really does wonderful things for your mind and is very therapeutic in situations like these.  I am certain I will probably have my diagnosis by Saturday also. If it's bad news it's going to want to make me run even more as I may not be able to run for a while, and if it's good news I'll want to run super fast just because I feel lucky. Good luck to you!",
