I only had one zoladex injection and had planned on just doing that until the summer but I am so glad I didn't. My OB and school instructors really pushed me to do it sooner (I am in nursing school so they all just wanted my ovaries out like yesterday). So I am glad I went ahead with it. The only down part is I can't drive a long distance because of the risk of DVT and this weekend my kids have a HUGE band competition and I couldn't go. I am however watching it on tv, they are streaming it live so I get to watch it. Then on top of it, my grandma died the day before my surgery and her funeral is today and that is almost 4 hours away so I didn't go to that either (it is ok, I was not close to my grandma but I did want to see my aunts, uncles and cousins). So ladies, no reason to put it off if you can get them out, it really is ok. I haven't taken a motrin since Friday morning and I haven't taken any pain pills at all. I will save those for later as a just in case for something else, but motrin was enough for a day for me.",

I am a little weird, I have my own pulse oximeter and I make sure my O2 levels are within ranges.

I can't eliminate all the hormones in my body (there are other glands in the body that make the hormones, but not at the same levels that the ovaries do), but I can reduce them and hopefully that will give the anti hormone medication a better chance at working and stopping progression. So if your cancer isn't hormone receptive, that might be a reason why the Dr wouldn't want to remove them. I started off with a medication that causes chemical menopause, but I quickly had surgery (within 4 weeks of my first injection), the oncologist and the gynecologist really wanted to get them out sooner than later.",

My youngest is 6, then I have a daughter who is 8 ( but she doesn't live with me, I had her for a gay couple but she knows I am her mother and she knows what is going on) then I also have a son who is 10 and a daughter who is almost 12 and again I had them for a gay couple and they know I am their mother but I don't know if they know what is going on, their fathers do, but I unfortunately don't get to see them as much I as do my younger daughter, then I have a step son who is 16, my son who is 16 and my oldest son is 19. So each kid has responded pretty well (the ones I know, know) my oldest boys understand what stage 4 means, they get that there is no guarantee I will be around for a long time, but they are hopeful that I will respond well to treatment and stick around for as long as possible. My step son doesn't quite understand it. He has autism and while he is doing very well, he just doesn't quiet get the gravity of it all. The youngest two just know I have cancer but they don't know that it will never be cured. My youngest boy thinks if I eat enough broccoli I won't have cancer. Thanks stupid commercials. We have not done counseling and really haven't done much of anything outside of treatments. I feel very good, I show no symptoms so I really just let them live their lives. We make tons of cancer jokes, but I think that is how we all cope, make light of things, even though we all know the gravity of it all.",

The info is actually very accurate and have helped me with a few tests (like the sepsis video).  I have a twisted sense of humor and I often offend others with it. I tell them too bad, I am the one with cancer, they have to deal with me. ;)",

I have a single mass in my lung and a 1.4 cm tumor in my right breast, but my lymph nodes all through my right axilla and my sternum are all involved. I am interested in complimentary treatment and would consider cannibis, but I'm in nursing school and it's not allowed at this point. But if there is ever a point where I leave school or the nursing profession, I'd be all over it.",
