I noticed 2 lumps underneath my left armpit and 1 lump underneath my right.  I just had a surgery because of an infection that occurred during one of my expansions to my tissue expanders.  I am not sure what it is.  I have an appointment to see my oncologist, but it seems really odd to me.  Don't know if this is typical.....",
