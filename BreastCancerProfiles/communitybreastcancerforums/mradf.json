Kaufman, seems to check out very well.  The website is impressive, but can be very subjective.  However, if you go to the NYS physician web profile, it all checks out.  No sanctions of any kind, and he's got a lot of experience.  Very reassuring.  He's also still listed as Chief of Surgery at New Island Hospital, which is most likely where the surgery would be.  Did he mention that?  Like everything else, a hospital stay is not as bad as you think.  If you need to stay, there is good reason, and it's very reassuring to be checked by the nurses 'round the clock.  And the hospital administerd pain medication isn't so bad, either.  All of this will begin to take the shape of a plan for you.  Your instincts will point you in the right direction.  If you have a primary care physician or gynecologist with whom you are comfortable, call them and ask for feedback.  You're doing fine.

You do have to meet certain guidelines, including size, and there is more use of an allograft material.  Google AlloDerm and you will get information on that in addition to what your PS tells you.  It is used in many implant reconstruction procedures, and was used in mine. I believe that not all PS's perform the one step, so you may need to expand your search.  Now, keeping in mind that many women come to this site because they need support early on, or for negative experiences, a women who posts here as \"femme\", and is from NY,  had a disasterous outcome with the one step.  If you search her, and send her a PM, I'm sure she can give you some direction. I have heard of other women on LI who have had it done successfully, however.  If you do a search on these boards as \"immediate reconstruction with alloderm\" you may find a few more women with experience.  A good source of reliable information about reconstruction overall is the website of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which is www.plasticsurgery.org, both my PS and Dr. Cooper are members, which is important.  And the best source overall will be the PS.  If he does not give you this option, it's likely he does not do it.  If you ask him about it, he should tell you straight out whether he does these and how often and the outcomes.  Oh, another thing,  for any procedure you are considering, he should be able to refer you to a patient who is willing to share her experiences.  Write it all down in your notebook!

So, you have barely three weeks to go.  Take some time to gather your comfy clothes (pull on pants and tops that zip up - your basic warm ups).  A recliner to sleep in at first.  Lots of pillows. If it has not already been discussed, ask your PS or a nurse about a post mastectomy camisole with pockets for the drains.  Get two, so you can rinse one out and always have a clean one. Insurance does cover them, and some BC coalitions donate them to the hospitals for the BC patients.  Do you have someone who will stay home with you at least the first few days?  You will really need someone to help you around at first, to put a meal together (even if it's take out or reheated), to reach for things, to help you bathe and shampoo, to bring you pain meds, to drive you to your first follow up appts.  There is a thread under \"surgery - before, during and after\" that offers a gazillion suggestions.  I will try to find it and \"bump\" it up for you.  We're with you all the way.  Be well, Maria   ",

Have you made a decision yet about your own reconstruction?  Some procedures will come with  significant downtime which I imagine will be a challenge with the children. How old are they?  Do you have anyone nearby to help when you have surgery - parent, sibling?  That may help guide your decisions.  Keep in mind that you can have a mast then be reconstructed any time in the future.  Be well, Maria",

I do not have to be in this situation. I am responsible for putting myself, this man\" -- here she gestured towards her husband -- \"my family and, frankly, all of you at risk, too. Because I think you deserve to vote for this man.\" What she was saying -- and everybody there understood the implicit message -- was: I am going to die before my children get to high school because I didn't get a mammogram...\" Who knew!?   The irony is that my sister was vigilant about screenings (as was I), and Mrs. Edwards was not.  By all accounts they both showed amazing strength and grace, and neither deserved this.

I noticed in one of your posts you were ordered to stop research for 24 hours.  I can relate to that!  All my doctors discovered I was an information junkie and I had to temper that with the idea that, in some cases, a little knowledge is a bad thing, and could not compare with their wealth of education and experience.  I would finish every appointment with the question \"what did I not ask that I should have?\"  and in most cases, I hit all my marks, but in some cases they came forth with great information and advice.  Bottom line is I had surgeons who were highly recommended and very experienced, and with whom I felt very comfortable.  In answer to some of your other questions, I had full MRI, pelvis included, CT scans, and all the biopsies offered.  As far as oncology, I did not have a consult until after surgery and had my pathology report.  I did not need chemo or radiation because the surgeon \"got it all\" and it was not invasive.    That was my goal, and the price of admission for that was my breasts.  But I just got them back!

I opted for bi-lateral mastectomies (one side had cancer and one side was prophylactic) and this type of reconstruction.  Depending on what surgery you elect to have, you will come to learn all the lingo, but, if you opt for mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, a common method is to place tissue expanders were breast tissue used to be.  Basically, they are temporary implants which eventually get exchanged out for permanent implants.  I'll leave all the details to your PS consult. I had a few complications post mastectomy, so there have been some delays, but I have no regrets and would choose the same path again if I had to.  Fortunately, I have a very supportive husband and family as well as a very supportive work environment.  About 15 years ago I left the corporate world (I was a bank manager) to raise my children, then returned to a much more casual work environment (I am an office manager for a small commercial carpentry company).  I went from suits and heels to jeans and flats. I even have my own hardhat with a little pink BC ribbon on it in case I have to go to a jobsite.  Three months after re-entering the workforce, I had a routine mammogram and BAM!  Life was turned upside down.  I may have gotten more financial support from a corporate environment in terms of better disability income, but I never would have had the same emotional support I have gotten from the blue collar environment.  We have medical insurance and I collect the max NY disability, so we survive, and I am aware that we are more fortunate than many . So, I am going to brave the \"meet the teacher night\" at my daughter's high school.  I feel well enough and found a suitable outfit that doesn't look like PJ's or hurt any of the incisions.  Keep us posted.

The other option is to do nothing, concentrate on getting from pre surgery to post surgery and then deal with it all.  All I did was make sure that the surgeons got pre certifications from my insurance company for my surgeries and hospital stay.  Oh, my PS used alloderm on me.  I really can't tell if it made a difference - because what can I compare it to? - but I trust he knew what he was doing.  This is the issue I want to take on when I'm \"finished\" because I was put through the insurance trials.  If found that if I did my research and said the right things, I got satisfaction.  Knowledge is power.  Let us know how it goes.

They were a great help to me last year.  Going up and down the stairs was not a problem for me at all, but I could not sleep in my bed for some time.  I camped out on the main floor in a recliner with tons of pillows.  I let my legs help push me up as my arms were weak and tender for a few days.  In your case, you will have the abdomen weak as well.  It's a sure bet that \"Mom\" will be quite busy for the first few days, at least.  She will most likely need to help you up, help you wash, empty your drains, prepare meals, do laundry,  and drive you to your follow up appointments.  Soon enough, your strength will come back and you will be able to do a little more for yourself each day.  Looks like your diagnosis is similar to mine.  Good luck and be well.

Some of you are really putting down those feelings most of us have about coming to this site for support and understanding.  Annie, I'm so glad you didn't leave. Funny thing is, about a week ago, I wasn't checking in so often.  I felt better, and like I didn't need the \"fix\".  I was cleared for work this coming Monday, 5/5, and had a lot to do to get back into the swing.  So I did.  I apparently did too much.  But, who knew?  I had no restrictions.  No one said specifically \"do not pick up, load, and unload two cases of water on sale this week only for $3.88 limit 2\".  Anyway, late Sunday night, during a typical Sunday night insomnia session (God does work in strange ways), while I was wide awake, a blood vessel ruptured above one of my \"under reconstruction\" boobs, swelled to the size of a football within one minute and, after calling the PS and 911, I had emergency surgery, #3,  and lost a lot of blood.  I almost needed a transfusion, but a shot of \"procrit\" and iron supplements seems to be working.  I was admitted for two days and am home now with a lot of restrictions. This may seem off topic, but I'm getting to my point. I have kind of felt since my pathology that I am not really a \"victim\" of BC since I do not need chemo or radiation. I almost feel, and I haven't voiced this to anyone else yet, like a fraud. My BC support nurse has already told me it's okay to feel what I really feel.  That having the initial diagnosis and bi-lat masts w/recon is enough to justify occasional feelings of frustration and despair, and that was  before surgery #2 to replace an expander following a staph infection. Back in the hospital this week, with the pink BC bracelet on to identify my status, and being visited by the special BC nurses, made me realize I am a \"victim\" of BC!  No matter how strong I am when I look at myself in the mirror and see what I see, I am still one of you.  I deserve and need to be here.  Despite the love and support I get at home, from my friends and my medical team, no one does it better than you ladies here.  I do feel like shedding a tear, but the anti-depressent is working well.  Or maybe it's just PMS.  I wonder how that will affect my blood. Thank you all. Be well, Maria   ",

Look for BethNY on these boards, who underwent bi-lateral mastectomies with reconstruction in her 20's, and not all that long ago, so she's very up to date with information. Be well and good luck.  Maria ",

As far as doing everything together, I'm thinking that if it's okay with the doctors, why not?  I would have asked, too. As far as the MRSA goes, that's a risk anytime.  Use all the pre-surgical precautions I've read about, like using a special soap before surgery and so on.  Keep us posted, because you will not be the first one to have to do this.
