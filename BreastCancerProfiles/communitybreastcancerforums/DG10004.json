      "Content": "Jul 10, 2018 01:02PM - edited Jul 10, 2018 01:04PM by DG10004 Hi there! I started radiation on July 5th. I'm scheduled for 6 weeks (35 treatments). They're all whole breast/lymph node targeted. I actually consulted with a different RO before the one I am currently seeing. I liked the first RO a lot, but that hospital, which is where I had chemo every 3 weeks, is an hour drive from home.. The amazing treatment and team is worth the drive every 3 works, but to go there 5x a week for radiation was going to be tough. Since I'm not working, I decided to get my radiation at a closer hospital and save some gas money. The first RO decided on a slightly different treatment plan for me. He was going to do 7 weeks of radiation, 5.5 weeks of which would be whole breast and 1.5 weeks of boost radiation. On the other hand, my current RO opted for only 6 weeks, all of which would be whole breast (so none targeted to the tumor site). Having been given a different timeline and plan from the first doc, I did ask her about her reasoning.. I was comfortable with her response though and consequently started treatment. Per both RO's, I only required 3 small dot tattoos.. not tape or marker. Therefore, no restrictions on bathing or anything like that. The possibility of radiation burns, peeling skin, and open wounds does, however, put us all at risk for infection so I was urged against swimming in ponds or lakes. I was told ocean water and chlorinated pools would be safe to swim in. I've had 3 treatments and so far, so good. No skin reactions yet, but I am expecting to see something after the next full week of treatments.",

My gynecologist called me to discuss these results and said that the surgeon may decide to do another biopsy because the histological and radiological properties don't align.. what I find ridiculous is that my surgeon, who did the biopsy, never once mentioned a discordance AND completely stood by the PASH diagnosis. I opted for an elective surgery to remove the PASH mass (lumpectomy) and as it turns out, the mass was cancerous!! The surgeon hadn't gathered a large enough sample size or biopsied incorrectly... I'm not sure what the reasoning is behind it. The point is I had one biopsy and it came back benign. There was, in fact, PASH in the mass but there was cancer as well.. Cancer that no one detected until the ELECTIVE surgery. It's wild to me... The reason I'm sharing this with you is because if it's even suggested that something was off with the biopsy or someone on your healthcare team doesn't trust the results, follow up intensely. Demand they do another biopsy or at the very least reassure you 100% that the first biopsy was an accurate representation of the whole mass. I don't wish the trauma I experienced from a poorly perfomed biopsy upon anybody..",
