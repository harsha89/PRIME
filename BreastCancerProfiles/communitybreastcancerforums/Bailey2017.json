Just had CT scan with contrast and dr. called and said- your breast cancer has returned. You have spots on your lung and on your sternum. I see oncologist this week and have a bone scan... Question.. how can they be SURE it is cancer from the CT scan? How rare is it to have this happen after stage 1 and after 11 years? I go from being in despair to being in denial...certain the dr. is mistaken!!! Any help appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

Original CT scan showed 2 sites on my sternum...one crushed part of the bone which is why I am in pain...and 2 spots on the lung. Dr. isn't sure if it is breast cancer mets or a new cancer (bone cancer most likely) that spread to my lungs. Either way it looks bad.... The waiting is so hard....I want to start treatments ASAP. Could use some more encouragement",

Now I just need to find a good oncologist that takes my Obamacare insurance.....I live 10 minutes away from one of the best hospitals in the country yet my insurance won't cover it. The only dr it will cover (I am serious...the only one within 50 miles)....is a general oncologist at a 3rd rate hospital 45 minutes away with good traffic.  Anyone else have issues finding a qualified doctor that accepts their insurance? The stress is too much!",

I am calling OSU to find out about private pay and financial assistance for a consult.... I'm going to the \"local\" dr. Tuesday to see what he has to say. I also had a heart valve replaced and have a pacemaker due to complete heart block (I was far more concerned about my heart than the recurrence of cancer!!)...and I want to be associated with a good hospital that can handle any complications with that.... ahhhh.. I felt so overwhelmed but thankfully some friends came over and we brainstormed and made lists of who to call and ways to fight the insurance company. I am prepared to start phone calls first thing tomorrow morning and we shall see what happens!  Thanks for the advice and the support!!!!!!!!!",
