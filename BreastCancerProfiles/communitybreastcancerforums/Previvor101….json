The most important thing in my life is my family and being there for them. As a result I decided to get my boobs off and I had my prophylactic nipple sparing mastectomy on 6th Feb, this year.  I had 2 step procedure with tissue expanders initially and then exchange to permanent silicon prosthesis scheduled for the 9th May. Whilst I am uncomfortable (and TE are asymmetrical) I think I made the right decision for me. I work full time and am the main bread-winner for our family so extended downtime following DIEP/flap procedure didn't appeal to me. Appearance with clothes on is good and no-one can tell. Can't wear all my designer low cut tops but maybe again one day.... Have absolutely no regrets about my decision. I have posted my pics on the picture forum if you have access. Not supermodel material but suspect that is me, not the surgery! My sister had a \"single procedure\" direct to implant after her prophylactic mastectomy and has had a number of complications  including skin necrosis and implant migration. I think everyone is different and you need to research you choices and work out what is best you you and your stage of life and lifestyle.  Good luck with your decision and once you decide, be happy with your choice!!!",
