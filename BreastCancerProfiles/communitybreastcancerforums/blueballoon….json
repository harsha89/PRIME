She never (NEVER) asked about my heart or lungs; and when I mentioned that my ribs hurt a LOT, she furrowed her brow and said that she had never heard of such a thing. My jaw dropped, because I knew that lots of women get costochondritis. After I ended up in the ER because my heart hurt so much (I was radiated on the left side), I told my rad onc that I was having heart problems, and then she did an amazing thing:  She got up and walked out of the room. If I were to do breast cancer treatment on the left side again, I would opt for a mastectomy and save myself from doing the radiation.  I am convinced that the radiation has permanently damaged my heart and my quality of life.  ",

Right after I finished radiation to the left breast (23 days whole breast + 7 days boost), my breathing was labored, I felt a lot of pressure on my heart, and my BP shot way up.  I went to the cardiologist, did an echo, and he said, \"Your heart is fine.\"  Without ever looking at the radiation graphs, he said, \"You weren't radiated through your heart. It's just stress.\"  I had seen the radiation graphs, and I KNEW the heart and lungs HAD been hit. I was taking 800mg to 1200 mg of ibuprofen a day, and it wasn't doing the trick.  Finally, I went to the ER, did an EKG, chest x-ray and blood work, and was told again, \"It's probably stress.\"  My next door neighbor is a good friend who knows me well -- and also happens to be a psychiatrist -- and she agreed with me, \"It's not stress.\"  I suffered for a month, and then finally went to the radiation oncologist for my one-month follow-up appt. I told her very calmly (well rehearsed) that my ribs hurt a lot and I had been experiencing a lot of pressure on my heart and lungs.  When I said the words, \"Emergency Room,\" she suddenly had fear on her face, then basically WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.  It was unbelievable.  It was more important for her to cover her rearend for fear of a lawsuit than to discuss the problem with me and find a solution.  I'm now one and half months out from my last radiation and I'm feeling slightly better, but I'm not normal by any means.  I am so disillusioned with the doctors.  Thanks for this thread!",

In the core biopsy, the intern didn't give me enough lidocaine and Dr. Wapnir never checked before pulling the trigger. Unbelieveable screaming pain. In the first surgery, the lumpectomy and node biopsy looked fine on a surperficial cosmetic level; but she also removed a major lymphatic vessel, even though there was no test that showed that it had cancer.  She told me she took it out because it was \"big.\"  I guess we're all supposed to the be the same size, right?  She told my friend in the waiting room that she took out the vessel because it \"didn't look good.\"  But there was no test that showed it had cancer. Dr. Wapnir never told me what to expect from the surgery, and when I asked questions, she avoided looking at me and rarely gave a substantive answer. It was clear to me that she was/is an extremely self-absorbed person.  When my margins were not completely clear, I was tortured by the thought that this uncommunicative surgeon was going to cut me open again.  But I mistakenly thought she was the best one to do the re-excision because I figured she knew my breast the best.  Big mistake.  In the re-excision, she got clean margins alright: 1-1/4\" x 1\" x 5/8\". After two surgeries, half my breast tissue had been removed. Oh... She took out a slice of muscle behind my breast too, even though the MRI showed that there was no cancer there.  When I asked Dr. Wapnir how much muscle she took out, she leaned into her computer with a defensive, scrunched up look on her face, and she said in a annoyed tone, \"Well, well... you still have your interstitial muscles!\"  (Did she mean \"intercostal muscles?\") When my oncologist saw the final pathology report, he was shocked.  He said, \"You would be hard pressed to find a more aggressive surgeon anywhere in Northern California. I'm really mad at her.\" When I asked Dr. Wapnir about exercises I could do to get back the mobility in my arm, she said, \"I don't believe in exercises, but you can talk to the nurse.\"  She also doesn't believe in drains after surgery, so after my re-excision, I developed a huge hematoma (internal bleeding) that went from my nipple to my hip. It's now been several months since I had the two lumpectomies with Dr. Wapnir, and I look back on them as big mistakes. I lost the lymph vessel in the first surgery and my muscle in the second surgery. Neither had any cancer. No surprise that I was left with lymphedema, a very weak arm, and a very ugly, mutilated breast. Oh, and because I didn't get a mastectomy, I ended up doing radiation on my left side.  If I had known how much my heart was going to be hit by the radiation, I would have chosen a mastectomy, but Dr. Wapnir never told me it was an option. My heart has not been functioning properly for several months now. All that glitters is not gold; and Stanford's Cancer Center is not always what it appears to be. I wish I had been more cautious before signing up with a surgeon there.",

While I was taking radiation, I had 16 sessions with a physical therapist, but now I'm on my own. I stretch my arm and chest muscles at least four times a day.  I also work very hard to break up the hard breast tissue by grinding it with my fingers (like working a stubborn piece of clay).  I'm doing everything the physical therapist taught me, but it seems that my tissue only stays somewhat flexible for a few hours and then wham...  The tissue is hard and stiff again.  How long is this going to continue?!  The physical therapist told me that my body would continue radiating for 3 to 6 months after my last radiation. Do I need to work on the tissue for that long?!!  I'm so sick of this.  Has anyone else fought extreme, stubborn stiffness for so long?
