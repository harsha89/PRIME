I was just thinking that bc.org should have a topic where women can tell their good news stories...if they start from the beginning and how scary their waiting was and people can refer to  all the b9 stories in one place, that would be so reassuring to us \"worried, but not diagnosed\" people!

(ZIP!)  A lump in the armpit can have many causes, b9 or otherwise. Even if someone here had had a lump in the same area that turned out to be cancer, it would not decrease or increase your chance that YOUR lump would be cancer. We, myself included, tend to try to figure out what''s going on based on anothers experience, and in this case, I've learned that just cant be done. The exact same lump on one women may be b9, while a less suspicious lump will be found to be cancerous...there is not much rhyme or reason. You need at the least a mammo and ultrasound. 80% of lumps are found to be b9, as mine was.  The waiting and testing is difficult to get through, but in the end I am happy to have the piece of mind that my lump was b9. In order to get this definite diagnosis, I had mammo, ultrasound, galactogram, and finally lumpectomy. It was all worth it.  Was the dr. you are referring to a gyn? If so, he should have no problem with a breast exam...and if not...see a gyn. If he was your gyn you should call back and ask for an ultrasound or mammo (or both). Sometimes you just have to come right out and say, \"I am not comfortable with that diagnosis\" (if you can call what he told you a \"diagnosis\")   Be ready to join the waiting game to find out what's going on, but it is well worth it! You have found the right place for information and support, as you will soon find out! We'll all be counting on b9 results for you...please let us know how you come along with the Dr. Hope he's willing to listen a little better this time around. Wishing you all the best,....anniee ",

By the way, if anyone was going to get ignored for something theysaid, it would have been me, and that certainly has not been the case....the women here have embraced me even when I got down-right bi**chy. So dont worry, nothing you have said put anyone off. I'm sure of that. As far as my huband, he doesnt know what to think....he's supportive and kind..as I'd expect because he's the nicest person I've ever met..He did palpate the lump for me, even though he really didnt want too. I wanted him to feel it so he would know I wasnt crazy.... he not the type to placate me at all, so I knew if he said yes he feels its a hard lump, than it definitely is..( I know it is, but sometimes I question myself) .my older sister who said \"oh yeah, I would be concerned about that too\" is more the type to say yes, just to shut me up!  Anyway, about you. The 27th is this coming Wednesday so try to keep yourself distracted especially over the weekend. It is very good that you are seeing a breast specialist right off the bat...with your symptoms I'm sure your just worried sick and that is normal....nobody wants to be poo-pooed when they have any question what is going on with breast health. As I say, I am not knowledgable enough about BC, so I will stay away from any advice giving.... I will just hope and pray that you find some peace while you are doing this waiting game, and that answers come as quickly as possible. Hopefully they will have a very clear picture of what is going on with the mammo and ultrasound... We will all keep in touch, dont worry! ((HUGS)).....Annie ",

I recently had a lump and discharge which the Dr. defined as just lumpy breast tissue...and I insisted it was a lump...(so middle of the road could be called thickening.) It turned out to be a b9 lipoma. (fatty tumor) I know how hard it is to wait for testing...thats the worst part...I was a wreck...try to keep busy..treat yourself to your favorite things. All the women here are very knowledgeable and supportive  and will help you through this...as Nash says, we dont want to downplay your fears...were just here to hold your hand and lift you up when you need it. How far along are you? You must be so excited...pregnancy is so fun, hopefully soon you will be back to counting the weeks and picking out carseats! I will keep you in my prayers that the answers will be very soon and \"boringly b9\" like mine was. ((Hugs))....Anniee p.s.

Is your mom seet up to see a Dr. soon? How old is she? There is still the possibility this could be a cluster of cysts, even with it being hard like that....I dont know about the lymph nose, but maybe that could be due to irritation? I dont blame you for being scared, though...those are scary symptoms, and your mom has already been through so much. We're all here to answer any questions you may have, and help lift you, or your mom up when you need it....I am not very knowlegeable myself, but there are many VERY knowlegeable and helpful veterans here who will be able to sort out your concerns.... I hope your mom can get into the Dr. right away and get some answers. I'll keep her my prayers starting now.... (((Hugs))).... Anniee ",

I hope your Dr. will fill you in a little better on what she thinks of things...just so you know, one really good diagnostic imaging tool is MRI...as you probably know already its a very expensive test.....so sometimes its hard to get your Dr. to order it, but with your family history...I would be very careful....up to 15% of lumps are missed on mammo...it probably is nothing to worry about, but \"probably\" just doesnt cut it for most women...I'm sure you feel the same way...thats why you're here....you have found a great place to gain support and knowlege...the ladies here are awesome!

Also it has been said many times here that the only good lump is one in a jar. Many women have had clean mammos AND U/S and have later been diagnosed with BC....at the same time,  keep in mind 80% of lumps are b9....but with your family history, I would want better reassurance than what they have given you... push for ANYTHING that will give you piece of mind....I am so sorry to hear that you lost your mother and sister, that is devastating... Do you mean your other sister had DCIS? Do you feel the lump also, and how big is it? How old are you? How many sisters do you have? (I have 6, only one has had BC)  Sorry for inundatiing you with so many questions.....I think you should at least check with the Dr. who found the lump....I hope you get more answers soon....Anniee ",

When she got the results of the ductography, she called and left a message to be seen again in 6 months, the milk is not a problem,(right side only) but didnt mention the lump at all. (I've had this milk at least 6 years. I called and told her I didnt feel comfortable with waiting that long, (this was December,) and she agreed to see me on Feb. 19.  Should I push for a biopsy? If so, what sort. The lump feels about the consistency of a stail gummy bear! LOL! It is about a centimeter long and thin. Am I making to much of this? By the way, I have not breast fed for 11 years. I am 44with surgical menopause at 38, with an older sister (46) diagnosed with IDC (negative brac1/2.) I also was just wondering if anyone else had ever experienced any symptoms of lactating?
