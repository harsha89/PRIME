There was another spot that they found on my Aorta but it was too small to biopsy and would have required me to go off of Chemo for open heart surgery. My doctor and me decided to treat it as unknown and see if it responded to the treatment I was currently on. Well after a Lumpectomy, 16 weeks of chemo and 60 some radiation treatments the cancer looked gone and I have been doing fabulous every since. However at my last checkup my Oncologist said that I need to get a CT scan, she indicated that it was just an annual process, but last year I remember her telling me that as long as my bloodwork came back clean there was no need for a CT Scan. So I have been a little nervous since I went in because of it. This morning I received a call from my Dr's nurse requesting that I call her for the results of my test............I am terrified right now and on the verge of freaking out because they usually leave a message with good news . I am scared my cancer is back. I have been telling myself over and over don't freak out. It's just a call. I am new at this maybe these will get easier as time. Please tell me your happy stories and add me to your prayers. This is in God's hands now so I will just take a breath and wait for the results. Log in to post a reply",
