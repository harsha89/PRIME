The area, and luckily the only area did still show enhancement so next week I'll have an excisional biopsy to confirm. ADH and Radial Scar are tricky and I totally understand the anxiety and stress you are going through with all the tests and waiting. The bright side is, the odds are decent that it will remain ADH and they can get it out and monitor you closely. If it is something, then it has been caught early. Those are the two things that I come back to when my thoughts go dark. I'll be sending good vibes your way for tomorrow, keep us updated!",
