Of course we are shocked and have been on a roller coaster of emotions. I'm 55 years old, 40 at original diagnosis. My youngest was 4 at first diagnosis. I prayed to see all my girls graduate from high school. I got that plus a precious granddaughter! I'm having ore tests this week and figuring out a plan. A lot of your stories are very uplifting and I pray for all of us in this crappy situation Log in to post a reply",

But reading these posts is inspiring to me and I want to thank you all. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this. My mom died if breast cancer in 1994. I have nightmarish images in my head of going through what she went through. Love you all!",
