In between this just found a little family history - paternal grandmother/ paternal aunt and only two female paternal cousins had BC with various degrees of prognosis.   So now a little concerned prior to US and made the commitment that is I can see them at the US and they are still there they are coming out .... So have the US see they are there , have to book back with refering dr who is  a ob/gyn. Back yesterday, The report was no where near as lengthy. says confirm finfings as before - several fibrodeamas.   However, and here is the part tha is perplexing me - axillary lymph node 3cm !!! I looked before and it was 1.6 6 months ago. The breast surgeon is on mat leave and I dont get to see until feb 12th which feels ages away. When I saw her last time she poo pooed the lymph node even being scanned and said this particular imaging center goes overboard . But Ive looked and a 3cm gland doesnt seem that good to me ? Or should I just relax based on what she is saying? Im trying to find another center that takes the insurance - of course it doesnt - because I have a feeling she will say all is ok just regular screens but honestly I want the fibrodeamas  ( rang from .5 - 1.62 a few of them ) and the lymph gland out. Very hard to stay subjective when its you . Dont want the $ expense of a surgery but also want to be sure they take you seriously ? so im waiting and wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience . I know they need to be biopsied i hate the fecking waiting - its been like 7/8 months so far !! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Tickyloo wrote: Holy Moly , Where to start. So I moved here from the UK a few years ago , didnt have insurance, never really been sick so only concerned about getting it for the kids. Got it, registered with Dr who said you need an annual physical ( we dont do those in the UK ) so saw them and the OB/GYN in Jan this year for an overdue smear test. To my surprise she asked me to release the girls and had a prod. Then said every so calmly I am goingto write you up for a mamogram. No need to panic and go today we just like to know what we are looking at . So that I did - not panic I mean . A few follow up phone calls saying \" where are you mamo results \" went ignored and then I got a certified letter in the mail saying \" you havent had it ! \" . I was a little concerned but friends reassured me that we get baseline mamograms over here around 39 ( I am 38 ) so I waited a few more weeks and then booked it for July 10th ( ok I know so six months is a long gap but it was a baseline mamo so ....  ) A little more on me if you will. I have been \" sick \" about a year after I moved here. Tiredness beyond comprehension. I would have to pull over picking my daughter up from school as I didnt think I could make it.  Brain fog that would cause me to forget what I was saying or an inabilit to drag the words out of my brain. I actually didnt take my US driving test for a few years because I could not remember a single word I read - even stupid stuff like what side you drive on ( dont panic I knew ) but I couldnt translate that into a test format that required an A/B/C/D format . Vaious other things but no insurance no known reason I just let it slide and tried to self heal - cut out gluten and diary and voila all ok . Still have unbelievable night sweats and still do. Anyhow mentioned this all to the dc at the time so wondering if this didnt have something to do with the order for the mamo ? So 10th July for for my forst ever mamo happily relieved that I now have insurance for thses anual things. Very excited by the free beverages and the whale music in the room. A little bit uncomftable as she tries to get my chest wall skin into a vice but hey ho done and then off to the gym. 8 days later I am again at the gym when I get a call from the imaging center saying ' hey, we got your doctors order so we want to schedule the diagnositic mamogram \"  I was like ' whoa there what do you mean, I havent heard from the drs\" the lady was yep, you need to come back they found something.     Me - blind panic, tears mid class run out and try in vain to get the drs to give me a call back. Finally the next day I get one ( after lost of calm followed by teary followed by GODDAMIT JUST GIVE ME A BLOODY CALL Back \"   I get an answer phone message saying 3 areas of local assymetry on right breast .     This was of course a friday so I spend the whole weekend googling everything and anything to do with the few words and ranged from doom and gloom to stupid machine has a shadow or I didnt wipe all of my soap off type stuff. Are you still reading lol. So being from the UK this whole insurance lark is a nightmare for me and I spent the next few day ( Diagnostic Mam and US ) were scheduled for that weds trying to get someone to give me an exact ( to the nearest $100 btw ) of how much it would cost and I had answers ranging from FREE ( yay ) to around $3795 ( ouch ) . Big difference and one quite frankly I couldnt take a chance with esp if it turned out to be a mistake with the first one . So I cancelled this apointment and found an imaging center that could confirm 100% that my isnurance would cover both and it was $75 . I just needed my films. I pick them up , of course I look at them and yikes. No mistaking that , three def little masses on the boobies . Seeing it in black and white made me panic again and google a zillion mamaogram scans for one that look like mine . And I go from shit , what if the OB/GYN saw something nd I have left it six months or ok so what if this is just because I have lost a ton of weight ( 30lbs since Feb ) and its all the fat being distributed .   Wait Mrs, wait. Patience Mrs patience. but ahhhhhh reallly, this is real fear isnt it a crippling cant breathe fear ! So story so far. Had the diagnostic mamo and US this weds. The technician said, nope they didnt go on compression :(  took a load more images - she said she would just need one but then when I asked to look at them - because of course now I am an expert on mamogram images thanks to google ha ha - she said do you know what I am going to say I think they are just cysts.  YAY . I said great why do you think that. She said the shape of cysts are smooth. SO i say great lets blow it up - god damn it they werent smooth and I could tell she say it too but I keep smiling. She said the US tech would be able to tell me more. If they were full of fluid they were def cyst , try and be positive blah blah blah. So go into have US. Said dont bother with the gown, just had these babies squished who is worried about modesty lets just get it over and oh could she please tell me if they have fluid.  Oh I am sorry she said I can not tell you that I am just a tech. I beg I plead but nothing but I keep at it  and she lets slip that the first one if solid . Man ! really . She looks at the other so I say \" solid too ? \" in a bright cheery voice. Aha she says. Me still smiling like my mouth is gonna crack. Check my armpit I say I dont want to have to do this again , she does but I stop looking . So here we have it. Today is now Friday , I called and they have not done the report and I have one tech saying its cysts without looking at the shape and another tricked into saying its solid and I know I have about 5 days more to get the latest. But then from what I can read its still more waiting . Boy its good to vent. Only my husband know, dont want to feel stupid when it all comes back ok so havent share with anyone but I think even he is a little sick of my constant on line medical comments ! Thanks for listening. Q is it comment to have BC in three sep areas . I can show the pictures ? Log in to post a reply",

They havenot noted any new lumps but on the last report it said axilliary lymph nide 1.6 and this time 3cm - its this that has me worried - should i worry if all the radiologist did was mention its size ( Btw previously it said BIRAD 3 likely Fibros ) Log in to post a reply",
