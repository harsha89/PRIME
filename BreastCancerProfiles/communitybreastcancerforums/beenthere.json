Helps the burned esopahagus and nausea. Would also recommend Willow Tea. You can simply find a tree, clean a branch and boil the leaves, makes a large quantity and you can keep it in the refrigerator for daily use during treatment. Willow leaves can also be frozen when fall is approaching for winter brew needs.",
