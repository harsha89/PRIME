A consultation with the breast surgeon was scheduled, at which time I met the surgeon, and she explained to my husband and me what they saw on the mammogram, what the procedure would be like, etc. The biopsy was done two days later. I actually appreciated meeting the surgeon and understanding the process ahead of time. I was able to do some reading and mentally prepare myself. I know how hard it is to wait, and it seemed to take forever to finally get the diagnosis and schedule surgery. Then I had to wait for the surgery! As everyone here says, the waiting is the hardest part, and you will feel better once you know what you're dealing with. I wish you the best.",

I used a shower chair and a hand held shower attachment but my husband washed my hair for me. He was actually very good at it. I bought a pouch for the shower on Amazon made of netting that I put my drain bulbs in to shower. It ties around the waist and is very quick to dry. The seller makes them, I believe. It allows the drains to generally stay in place and no safety pins. Very inexpensive and worth every penny. I will try to find a link and post it, but search mastectomy and shower and it should come up. Shower chair is nice because you are a little more unsteady than you think after anesthesia and pain meds. Best wishes to you",

A mastectomy was recommended (by two different doctors) for my cancerous breast. My DCIS was high grade, and ER-/PR-. They had to do additional staining because a few cells looked suspicious for invasion. (Fortunately for me, everything was DCIS after final pathology). I chose to have both breasts removed. I hated every second of the diagnosis, the worrying, the waiting - way more than I loved my breasts. I made my decision instantly, as soon as the first doctor recommended mastectomy on the cancerous breast. More than anything, I just wanted to do as much as I could to ensure that I never had to face this again. I have not regretted my decision for one minute. Please know that whatever you decide, it will be what you thought was best for you, at the time you made the decision. Try not to second-guess yourself. This is an awful disease, and I'm so sorry you are having to make these decisions.",
