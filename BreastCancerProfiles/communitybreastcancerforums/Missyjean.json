My skin was a horrible mess despite putting aquaphor on it twice a day and using the mepilex AG. I am 12 days out since my final treatment though and it is looking great. I had blisters, peeling, hyperpigmentation, redness, itching, stinging...... Yuck! So thankful it healed so fast. ",

Was supposed to start at the end of July but on the last day of chemo, the NP punctured my expander while doing a fill:(. I had my CT sim the day after chemo but when we went to do the dry run three weeks later the expander had shrunk too much so we had to start over.  Anyway, had my dry run on Tuesday and started treatments Wednesday. I am doing 25 so will be done September 24th.  Charusa- I too have both the tattoos and the stickers. At least the tattoos are tiny.  Best of luck to everyone, hopefully we will all breeze through!",

I was supposed to have it for 25 but my skin did not hold up so well.  I'm very fair skinned and almost overnight I had the worst \"sunburn\". I had blisters all over and some eschar under my armpit. It was so painful.  My RO decided to go to the boosts for 5 days and then go back to finish the whole breast afterwards to allow for some healing.  I had been very faithful in putting on the aquaphor everyday since rads started too. Ugh!  Anyway this week I've been using the Mepilex AG pads and ice and I am peeling like crazy but it's finally feeling better. 4 more to go!!!! I hope my skin holds up. I have worked full time throughout rads but I worked part time through chemo. I'm a NICU nurse and we get so busy this time of year so I felt like I needed to go back. It's been really hard but I just sleep lots on my days off. I also have kept my diagnosis private except for out unit manager so to keep questions at bay I needed to return as well. Congrats to those that have finished!!!! We should all be so proud of ourselves for pushing through this!!",
