I want to be prepared and walk out feeling like we are moving forward.  What should I be asking?  Or should I be a sponge and listen and absorb? I hope you all know how much I appreciate all the advice, compassion, insight and support I have gotten from you all!!  You are the ones who are making this time so much easier, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart!!
