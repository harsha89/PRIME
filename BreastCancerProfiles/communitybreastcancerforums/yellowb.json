Any chance they also giving you Neulasta? That, I hear, can cause a lot of bone pain. Oh, and editing to add: I'm under the impression that the Taxol slows growth and spread -- so for instance, they will use it first in aggressive cancers to stop them from spreading. Though that's coming from a new cancer patient, so take it with a grain of salt!",

It's a Jon Renau Evan, with a dark brown root and copper/auburn/ medium brown body. Adorable. Lace front and movable part. For reference, my head is 23.5\", and if I'd known more about how wigs fit, I wouldn't have grabbed this. Free to a good home, and it's had perhaps 6 hours of wear, being generous.

On round two, I took an atavan around 6 pm after the infusion, and it worked like a charm against the insomnia -- I got nine hours of sleep and am back at work today. I also was very, very careful about my eating the night and morning before the infusion -- Soup with fiberful vegetables, and about twice the number of prunes I ate the first time around. It does seem that that might also be an effective technique for less grief this week. Also, my thinning eyebrows suddenly have gotten very short -- little wimpy dashes. I am down to about 10 eyelashes on each eye. I will update as to how it goes.",

      "Content": "Nov 22, 2018 01:17PM - edited Dec 28, 2018 04:31PM by yellowb Well, I am done with AC and Neulasta now. I did 4 DD, after 12 DD Taxols. Everyone experiences this differently, and I experienced each dose pretty differently as well. But these would be my overall tips for the AC and Neulasta: Have both prunes and bananas on hand, because you might experience either constipation or diarrhea, or fluctuate between them, and fruits are a lot easier on the body than OTC medicines. I kind of swung on this -- the first few infusions, constipation was a problem; by the last one, everything I ate passed straight through me, I lost weight, and was stuck on the BRAT diet for a bit. The Neulasta was much harder on me than the AC -- I would shake all night as though cold, while sweating, the night of the Neulasta injection. Really, really important to drink a lot of water on Neulasta night if you want to be [relatively] well by morning. I used both Claritin at night, starting the night before the Neulasta and continuing for 3 days, as well as Tylenol by day for the bone and joint pain. I also had sore muscles -- painfully sore and swollen. Tylenol helped with that as well. Generally, a gallon of water a day helped in every way. I found it easier to drink that volume of seltzer rather than flat ... it's just a lot of water to get through. Nothing really tasted very good, so I would make a big pot of nourishing soup a few days before the chemo so there was at least something very easy to eat in the house that was also good for me. Walking a few miles every day also seemed to really help remind my body it is in fact a body that can do things. I wasn't able to exercise much more than that on the AC, but the one time I did get to the gym for a feeble work-out, it was wonderful. It took me awhile to work out what Zofran did for me. I never felt nausea, but I would get a weird sort of unease in my body that Zofran addressed. I guess that is nausea, but it was more nebulous than being sick to my stomach. ETA: I didn't get the dreaded mouth sores, but I did have bleeding gums for a few days each cycle, except the last one, despite popsicles and icing during the push. And editing again to add: My hair has just started making a comeback, 5 weeks after the end of chemo. My eyebrows and lashes actually came in quicker, around 3 weeks, although they are still very, very short. That's all I can think of! Best luck to everyone embarking on this. It's not pleasant, but it's doable.  ",
