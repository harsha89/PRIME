There are various treatments to bring them up (transfusions of platelets, immunoglobulin, romiplostim etc). My platelets were 80 last week but onc went ahead w treatment. I think my onc is prepared to treat at low levels because he knows they are not unusual for me. Tioday they are 31 but hoping they will come back up before Mon when my next treatment is due. I don't think he will treat if below 50. I knew the new drug I started 2 weeks ago would take a month to kick in so not surprised by this. They have dropped as low as 5 before!

Onc was in NY so no-one was around except registrar and he is always a bit panicky. Normally I'd argue but decided this wouldn't do any harm. Was finally discharged that night at 11pm as haematologist had authorised so I escaped a hospital breakfast. On water, I was told 8 glasses a day. Then had a complete meltdown on Saturday - provoked by something trivial - a photo book of our wedding anniversary party which had hardly any photos of me and it made me feel like I was already a ghost. It all just got too much. My poor husband didn't know what was going on as I am normally v stoical. My mum died of cancer when I was 11 and she was in her 50's. I have worried the same would happen to me although I am now 18 months older than she was when she died. Work is just too busy. It was all just too much Anyway, pity party behind me now. Paris events certainly help perspective. Treatment hopefully on Wed and then we are going to our home in Italy for the weekend for the olive harvest. Scans when I get back. Texas I have had CMF about two years ago and my onc has it on his list as a possible future treatment. There is a well known specialist in London who recommended a 6 month course for me in 2013 and I was NED throughout. It was just after I had had my lumpectomy. As I remember it was easy to tolerate.

Blood will be interesting as my platelets normally fall off a cliff about 2 weeks after treatment but I don't know this cycle as I haven't had any tests. All I do know is that when I tripped over dog last week and cut my arm, I expected it to bleed (no platelets) and it didn't. Will get results on Friday evening. Onc will only give results face to face. He argues he has to be present for bad results to provide solutions and a plan and that doesn't work if you are prepared to give good results over the phone or e mail. He's an amazing guy.

Had scans today - MRI on pelvis where I have one maybe two known lesions, CT on brain where there was a suspicion of a tiny lesion in July, and PET on brain and body where there were enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and possible inflammation in lungs. Fearing the worst about brain which is the one which scares me. Blood counts have been so volatile I have had to miss some treatments. Results on Thursday. Onc won't give over phone whether good or bad. Says he needs to be there if it's bad and that doesn't work if you release good news by phone. Tomorrow is going to be difficult but I have an all day meeting to distract me. Anyway time to curl up on the sofa wth the dog.",

I have mets showing in chest lymph nodes but they are shrinking and showing less uptake. Nothing in brain (hurrah) and my one bone lesion also improving. My wonderful onc said it was a great scan and was v pleased. He's reducing drug dosage (which he hopes will mean drugs will work for longer). Only bad news was v low Hb/platelets count so I am sitting waiting for a blood transfusion. Wishing good results to others.",

Worried about this as my leg has been hurting for a couple of weeks and the pain is in the place where I had a bone lesion. Normally I would have had scan straightaway but I was just about to leave for Italy and decided I'd do it when I came back. Worrying also about platelets and blood count which I have no way of checking here. But I'm guessing platelets have collapsed again as I have an enormous bruise on my wrist. So not having a v relaxing holiday. Don't have energy to do much other than look at the view. Hope everyone has a good week",

Brain still clear (that's the recurrence I really fear), leg about the same - still showing activity so I am going to have an MRI of pelvis, hips and upper leg next week to see if it's progression or healing. Hilar nodes about the same apart from one a bit larger at entrance to lungs. Some tiny nodules in one lung. After discussing w onc whether this was just some inflammation and not progression, he sent us to see the reporting radiologist ( who kindly saw us straightaway at 7pm on a Friday night). He took us through all the relevant areas and a comparison with previous 2 scans and was hugely reassuring. 95% certain nodules just some inflammation from a cold not MBC. So glad onc suggested seeing the radiologist. Onc's summary was v mild progression but depends on nodules. If they are not MBC, probably stable not progression. No treatment change. Time for a glass of red wine! Thanks for all thoughts and wishes and hoping others get good news too. Next time I think I'd have scan before holiday rather than after.",
