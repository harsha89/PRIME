The doctor told me the procedure names but I had to ask twice for her to explain exactly what was going to happen. They took a needle and inserted it first finding that it wasn't fluid filled then did the core biopsy, where they took 4 samples. The machine is very loud and I stupidly looked round when she clicked to demonstrate. I was in a terrible state and did feel pain, my mum was able to come in and I'm grateful for that as I was in too much shock to ask questions or understand the next stages/timescales. In hindsight it could have been worse, but I'm grateful for this site for making me feel like I wasn't alone in what I felt. Needs must and if I had to do it again I would although would likely be as worked up. They didnt use any radiology equipment to guide and I have been warned that sometimes (although they took 4 samples) they may not have actually got the lump. They suspect the lump is benign especially due to my age 25, and say its common in young women so fingers crossed although I'm not nervos to get the results, just would like to put a line under it now! Good luck and keep healthy, i really do appreciate finding this forum! S",
