      "Content": "6cooks wrote: Hi everyone, Went in for my weekly Taxol today. I have had 5 weeks so far, (prior to Taxol I had 1 tx of Taxotere/Avastin but do to extreme SE had to stop that.) So my onc asks me about my side effects from Taxol. I tell him about the neuropathy in my feet and  R hand and that it is getting worse. (feet numb all the time and fingers painful). He decides I have had enough Taxol. The taxotere (which was every 3 weeks) counts as 3 weekly doses and 5 more would be 8 total. I was supposed to start A/C after Taxol but he says no we are going to do FEC (which I have heard of but never researched-didn't think I needed to).  I was a little confused as to why he was changing everything up all of the sudden. What should I expect from FEC? Honestly, I already feel kinda crappy tonight, even with premeds and EMEND. Is it crazy bad nausea with this regimine? I am also triple negative and I mentioned to him that TN respond better to chemo. He said \"some do but some are crazy aggresive and dont respond to anything\" which kinda freaked me out a little since mine is Grade 3. He aslo said FEC has less cardiac effects than AC and that is also why he is switching me . Is adriamycin stronger or better even with its worse SE? Is he saving that in case he needs it later? Do they even do that?  Just a little confused. Any insight would be appreciated. Marci pressure makes diamonds!

I found out the hard way that they were much less expensive online (after spending 500 for 2 at the wig store). Now, heres my deal, I bought them when I had hair and now that I have lost it I don't much care for the wigs. They feel loose like they are going to slide off, they are hot, and lastly I am so used to wearing a ballcap that I feel stupid in them. That's just me, a little buyers remorse. Oh well, live and learn. If you do  want to get one the Raquel Welch brand has very contemporary cute styles.  Lastly I had dry hair before chemo and now it seems the few strands I have left get oily quickly, probably partly because I am always wearing a hat and I sweat alot. Hope that helps! Good luck to you in your shopping! Marci",

I was the same way but instead I have found it so helpful and the people on here are so compassionate and caring it lifts my spirits daily. My lump also grew quickly to a 4cm. I know waiting sucks the worst, mine was right before 4th of July and we were going out of town, but try not to obsess. I am praying that you get the best news possible. Please let us know and if you do find out it is BC, we are here for you. Marci",
