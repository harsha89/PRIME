It looked like a small hickey but since then it has more than doubled in size gotten darker and has some dark spots like pits in it. That breast has also changed shape slightly and feels more dense. I have also noticed some discoloration starting around the lower part of the nipple on that same breast. I just want to know if this might be an indication of IBC and I should have it looked at. I have not found any lumps and there is no redness or warmth that I have noticed, but I am concerned that the bruise is getting bigger and not better. When I look for information about causes of bruising on the breast all of the results show up as IBC. Has anyone else ever had it start like this? Thank you! When it first appeared it was like a small 1/2\" hickey this picture is week one and about an inch This is today at two weeks and it is over two inches and darker Log in to post a reply",
