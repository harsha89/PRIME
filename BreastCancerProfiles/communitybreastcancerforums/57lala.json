I was that way through most of the journey, but now I just want my hair back. I guess I'm having a real pity party. Sixteen weeks since last chemo. Had very thick long hair and now I have the chemo curls. I HATE THEM! I feel worse then when it was shaved. Has anyone tried a natural straightener on their hair? My hair stylist won't do anything for six months. I don't want to hold out that long but I certainly don't want to go back to bald. There has to be something that will straighten this curl. HELP!",

It's only a little over an inch long but like a sheep. Lol. Anyway they keep saying three inches. I think I'm going to try and talk her into the straightener. I can't wait for three inches. It's so baaad. With the hot flashes and trying to work out at least some I have to wash it everyday. Doesn't feel that dry, just curly and when I sweat, REALLY CURLY",

I am 15 weeks since last chemo. For those who are still in the bald stage, I know it seems forever but it does return quickly. Now am dealing with \"CURLS GONE WILD!\". I am going to a good stylist on the 17th. She is going to look at my hair and try and to a relaxer or a straightener. I really am a sheep. Lol. I know it's better than bald but really? I didn't mind the short buzz as much as this. Some people really like curls so if that's you, you are in luck most of the people that I talked to had the chemo curl. For now I bought a couple of hats to wear for another week.",
