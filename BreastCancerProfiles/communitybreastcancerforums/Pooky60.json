It spread to my bones. It's in my left femur. I swing from incredible sadness to feeling pretty good about it. Everyone's got struggles and hardships and we're all going to die sometime. Yet I must outlive my parents bc I can not be the cause of inflicting so much pain on them. They are the most wonderful people in the whole wide world. I also have a sweet 11yr old grandson that DH and I are raising because his mommy died when he was 7. How can I now go and die on him? No way! I will not go gentle into that good night. Heck no! I'm gonna fight and claw my way into wellness. I might be deluding myself and spouting nonsense but I felt compelled to express all that. I'm grateful for this forum and for the advise and words of wisdom from all of you. I'm currently taking a shot of Xgeva once a month, Letrazole everyday, and Ibrance (21 days on 7 days off). I pray that we all live long healthy happy lives.",
