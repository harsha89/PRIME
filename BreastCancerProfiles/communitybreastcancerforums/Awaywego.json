My breast tissue is extremely dense so I opted for a double MX because I thought any future cancers would not be easily detected. I had my suregery a week ago and got the pathology back yesterday. Turns out I had DCIS in my left breast that was not detected by mammogram, ultrasound or MRI. All of these tests were conducted just prior to my surgery but none detected the 1.5 cm DCIS. I'm glad I made the choice I did but it sure wasn't easy.",
