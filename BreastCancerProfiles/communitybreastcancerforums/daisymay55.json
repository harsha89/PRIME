I will be starting chemo on January 5th. The oncologist advised today that the test results from my initial biopsy at the end of August were HER2 positive (I thought it was my path report after my surgery). But because of a \"clerical error\" and I guess the report not read thoroughly enough, the results showed negative. So, up until about three weeks ago, I believed all was good and I would be able to get by with radiation - chemo would not likely be necessary because of the good test results, no lymph node involvement and clear margins. It was quite a shock to go from that thinking to knowing that I am at high risk for recurrence. I am just hoping that with all the time that has gone by, I have not left it too late. I did have a chest xray and bone scan - both clear. So now we carry on and take one day at a time",

Due to the size of the lump, I am considered stage 2 but there was no sign of cancer in the lymph nodes the doctor removed. I am waiting for confirmation as there was a mixup on my pathology report but it would appear the I am HER2 receptor positive which puts me a high risk for recurrence. The oncologist is recommending chemotherapy, radiation and then hormonal therapy. I am very confused. I have had three different doctors tell me I am cancer free but because of the HER2, the doctor wants to give me drugs that will potentially make me sick to minimize my chances of getting sick? He couldn't really tell me if or when the cancer would return, but did say that it would be incurable if or when it did. He also couldn't tell me for sure that it wouldn't recur with the chemotherapy treatment he was recommending. Has anyone been in this situation. What would you do? gr Log in to post a reply",

It seems that now the pathology report has been cleared up, there seems to be some urgency that I get started with the chemo. The oncologist wanted me to start this week, but I need to talk to him again first because I still have so many questions. I just can't wrap my head around needing to go through what seems to be quite a tiresome regiment, not really knowing what will happen on the other side. I have been healthy my whole life. It all seems like such a crap shoot. Perhaps the chemo, etc will help, perhaps it won't? If I opt out of treatment, than what?",
