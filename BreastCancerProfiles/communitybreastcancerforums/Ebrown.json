    "Content": "Ebrown wrote: I was dx September 2016 as tripple positive MBC from the start. Had Taxotere, herceptin, & perjeta for 6 cycles plus Letrezole with great results. Had masectomy in January 2018 left side only and continued with just Herceptin with no side effects. Five months later right before I was scheduled to complete reconstruction, a reoccurrence was found, bilateral ER-/PR- & HER2 +. My choices were to continue with Herceptin & Perjeta, go back to Taxotere, Herceptin, Perjeta, or Kadcyla. I will never go back to Taxotere and I felt as though Herceptin & Perjeta served me no purpose. So I chose Kadcyla. Just completed my first treatment of Kadcyla and not only did I have a reaction, the fatigue, loss of appetite, & the nausea have kept me in bed for days. I feel like I don't want to continue this if this is how I am suppose to live. Are there any better days ahead? How can anyone stay on this indefinitely? Any suggestions please? There has to be another way? Log in to post a reply",
