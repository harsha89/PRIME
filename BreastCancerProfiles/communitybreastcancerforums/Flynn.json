She has both LE and brachia plexus damage on her right arm from her treatment many years ago. A couple days after Christmas, she slipped in the shower and broke her right shoulder. It still hasn't healed so she's facing surgery soon. Mil is very frightened of surgery on her damaged arm. She deals with a lot of pain already. Anyone here have non LE surgery on the arm that is impacted? We're talking to a couple good surgeons but also looking for any personal experience so we know what to expect. TIA ",

She is going into her LE clinic this week to see what they have to say, though it doesn't seem like she has a lot of non surgical options. Have a wonderful day!",

By the time I finished, there was not an eyelash or hair left, so I started progressing from that point. I also think hormonal therapy can impact tho I don't speak from personal experience. I found stopping wearing the caps awkward for a couple days and then very liberating. GL to all of you! VL22, thanks for your kind words!

My eyebrow loss kind of snuck up on me. They made it thru ac but left during taxol except a couple stray hairs. I've started wearing hats in public more except when my kids or their friends are around. I only wear the wig for a couple hours but heat has a lot to do with my discomfort and we're still getting up to 85 during the day. Sweating under the wig is so awful.
