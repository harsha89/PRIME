Each round takes very little time. The Rad Onc people have a Pandora account, ask me what I want to listen to and seldom get thru 2 songs before it's over. I did have a few days of fatigue but that went away and now I think I'm more or less back to normal energy wise. I was sold on radiation as I was told it cuts recurrence by more than 50%. I had a lumpectomy IDC, 5 mm, nodes are clear, Er + Pn- Hers2+, Grade 3. I have some lymphadema, mostly in the breast and a little in the arm. I'm working with OT and they can do so much to keep it at bay or even prevent it. She even gave me an exercise program called After Breast Cancer which would put me in better shape than prior to cancer; assuming I followed it.",
