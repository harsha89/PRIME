This is all one big huge learning curve for me and maybe it does differ province to province?",

      "Content": "May 24, 2011 08:11AM - edited May 24, 2011 08:21AM by Margi1959 Hi Saraho My mum has BC mets too.  First bout with BC was in 1995, lumpectomy, 2003 full mastectomy and that cancer was on her chest wall.  No further treatment or drug regime at her request.  This year, we discovered mets to thoracic bony structure, hips, pelvis, lung, skull and now we think it has moved into her liver.  She is in a wheelchair now because of the immobility of her pelvis and we honestly don't know how long she has left either.  She is now on Tamoxifen, Clodrinate (bisphonate for her bones), and Dexamethasone (steroid for swelling/pain) and she is relatively comfortable. Our first oncologist told us max prognosis is 2 years and I think that's so mean to literally give someone an expiry date.  We are in Calgary and, since that first nasty onc, we have had fabulous treatment from the folks at Baker.  Mum's had 6 radiation treaments, 5 of which were while she was in Palliative Care, Unit 47 at Baker and then one more after she was released in February. She is now home and relatively pain free although liver mets are causing her some discomfort now.  Her radiation oncologist, Dr. Teresa Trotter is an angel on earth and she even answers my email questions.  Please remember, that YOU are your mom's best advocate - establish a relationship with her medical care team and ask any questions that you can think of.  When my mum was hospitalized for pain in January, Dr. Trotter told me that I have the right as Mum's advocate to stop any testing if I felt it was causing my mother too much discomfort.  I did do that - and it was an excruciating decision, but they were poking and prodding my poor little mum too much and we already knew that this was metastatic breast cancer so further testing really wasn't going to cure her.  It was time to accept her palliative status and just work to make her pain free.  Since we stopped the testing, we've been able to achieve that!  And remember to ask your MUM questions too - how is your pain, how is your appetite, what are you worrying about, how can i help, etc.  She may not know how to verbalize what's really going on but she will most likely talk to you easier than she will to a doctor.  My mum is 78, btw, and she does sometimes get confused about things so it's my job to act as her interpreter to her doctor.  She lives in Cochrane, AB and the home care resources in Alberta's small towns are simply amazing.  We have a nurse that calls every day and comes to her house at least 3 times a week, we've had a palliative pain care doc come to her house, blood testing done in her kitchen - it truly is a comprehensive coverage that is available to us. By all means, get second opinions if you feel you need them!  Please feel free to contact me off the board if you need a shoulder.  It's not easy being a cheerleader sometimes when you can see your best friend withering before your eyes and you are powerless to stop that train that's coming straight at her!  I'm walking the same path as you are right now, maybe a little further down the trail but I initimately know how scary it is and how strong we have to be for our Mums. Big hugs to you <3 Margi (margi@newstartventures.ca)",

      "Content": "Margi1959 wrote: Hi Folks, I've spent the last hour reading posts and am amazed by everyone's bravery, but not really surprised.  My mum turned 78 on Feb. 13 and it was 2 days after we got her out of hospital, which was something none of thought would happen.  She was first diagnosed with bc and a lumpectomy in 1995.  All clear until 2003 when she needed a radical mastecomy on the other side.  This time, the cancer was on her chest wall. Both times, she refused further treatment or chemo.  She did the cancer diet.  Now, here we are in 2011 and last September, she started complaining about back pain.  We are in Alberta, Canada and our medical system is very slow during the diagnosis part.  It took us until January of this year to find out this is metastatic breast cancer.  To spine, neck, hips, pelvis, ribs, skull and right lung.  No one even tested her for cancer until January - but, rather, sent her for chiropractic, massage, accupuncture, CT scans of kidneys...it wasn't until a chiropractor in January noticed her cough - so HE sent her for a chest x-ray.  That's when we found it.  By the end of that month and after a horrible three weeks on morphine, I hospitalized her because she was dying before my eyes.  Morphine was NOT the right drug for her, it wasn't touching her pain, it was making it so she couldn't eat.  We very nearly lost her in that first week in hospital. Then we met a wonderful palliative pain care doctor who tried Fentanyl and Dexamethasone.  Titrated up until we found the right balance and my little Mum was finally pain free!  She flourished after that and, after a bronchoscopy we learned that this truly is b/c and not lung cancer.  It was at that point that I stopped all further testing for her because the poking and prodding was adding to her misery.   Once we stopped the testing and got her pain under control, she started to rally and we were all overjoyed to beable to take her back home again.  Mum lives alone and has since she was 35, so caregiving for her isn't an easy task.  However, in the months that have ensued, she has become wheelchair bound so I am back and forth to her house at least three times a week to give her a hand.  I prepare meals in advance for her and keep her house running.  She is doing tamoxifen, clodrinate, fentanyl, dexamethasone and blood pressure meds.  Last week, she developed a lung infection, so a course of antibiotics has cleared that up and brought us back from a place that we were worried it was time for hospice.  Now that her O2 level is better, her thoughts are much clearer - today she even let me take her for a walk/roll around the block and she was SO proud of herself!  :)   Last week, our nurse told us that she thinks she most likely has liver mets now too.  Not easy news to hear, but - as always, my Mum takes it in stride and carries on.  Our little Energizer Bunny.  Of course, this isn't a formal dx, but getting one would mean getting her into the city (a 45 minute drive) and then sitting in a waiting line for hours.  It's just too much to ask her to do and...really...what good would it do.  The way we see it, we're almost 2 years into the mets now as we did notice some gait changes in summer of 2009, so we are thinking that's when it went in to her hips. We take each day as it comes.  Some are good, some not so much and we all know what's coming but, for now - we embrace the good ones and deal with the bad ones.   No real reason for this post other than to introduce myself, Margi, I'm Myrna's 51 year old daughter and only child. I also have an only child, aged 29 and she has an only child, aged 6 - we are 4 generations.  I'm blessed in that I do work from home so that I can go to Mum whenever she needs me.  I run my own business and it's something I can maintain from her house as need be.  Sure am learning to be thankful for life's little miracles and have hopefully retained some of the tenacity given to me genetically.  Yes, it's hard to watch Mum slip away like this but, man, it's a gift to be able to be there with her for the ride and make sure she's as comfy as we can make her.  We have great palliative care nurses and a doctor that come to her home and are only a phone call away.  Even though life can get dark brown and lumpy, there are still good days and for that, we are blessed. Mum was promoted to Heaven, 10/1/11. Two days later, Dad died. Two days later, Hubby was dx with esophageal cancer. After surgery, chemo and rads, he is thriving.
