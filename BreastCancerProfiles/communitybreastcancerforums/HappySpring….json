The first two they did on Monday Dec 9 and what a relief that was. Doing my happy dance . So tonight will be my first night sleeping drain free. Anyone find it painful to sleep at night? I don't have much pain during the day, but at night when I go to lay down, it hurts. It hurts enough to wake me up that I have to sleep sitting up. Does it ever get better? I have TE's in place and plan to do silicon implants in about 3 months and nipple recon soon following that. What's the turning point where life can feel a little more normal? @ SWIMMOM2 - I saw my PS today and I'm still in a surgical bra and he said I can wear sport bras but no underwire. My drains are out as of today. Since I can't lift my hands over my head yet, I will have to still wear it. I feel like a T-Rex with little baby arms.",

It would come and go, but when it came on, it made me stop in place and I would keep checking too to see if a bruise would develop or if the area was red.  I even had my mom looking and touching.  Couldn't explain it. It was under the skin in that one little area.  My guess now is that the drain was sitting on a nerve and when the drain was pulled out it upset the area.  At this point it went away, but I was concerned for a while wondering why I had it.  I thought it strange to have pain in my shoulder blade, but my PS looked confused when I said something.  Glad that feeling is gone now.  I hope my story helps you.  ",

On the picture forum on page 2 titled From TE's to Sientra Implants the author got the anatomicals back in 2013 and I was hoping she would post a picture because no matter where I look I've never seen how the Sientra's look.  I even bumped the thread 2 weeks back or so and no reply.    My PS is considering 410's FF probably 535 cc.  I'm thinking and thinking which is hurting my head that maybe I should go for 595 cc if it is at all possible.  I refuse any further fills.  Also thinking about the Mentor HP....then rippling can be more of an issue. I still have a little time to figure this out.  However with the Sientra's, they are softer than the 410's.  But I don't think they go as big as the 410's.    I have another question at hand.  My left side is larger than the right side.  Even though they are filled exactly the same at 500 cc. PS said it could be the shape of my chest wall.  He said he would put the same size implants in and on the small side he would even it out with the fat grafting. Now would that side then be way softer than the left?  I'm thinking he should go with a smaller in the left and larger in the right.  Would this be correct in thinking?",

Having to reach for the Advil.  I described the pain to my family as...remember when you were a kid and your friends would give you an Indian Burn on your wrist...well it's like the burning feeling, but goes away as soon as you adjust your position.  During the day I am fine.  But just don't lift or pull things cause that can set you back pain wise.  I made the mistake of vacuuming the rugs cause I felt so good that day, like super woman and boy I did myself in for a few days.  I couldn't even breath it hurt so bad.  And yes, they feel like they are in my pits, but you get used to it sort of.  Also one is higher than the other.  But that is okay cause when they do the exchange it won't be like that.  ",

Going to meet my Oncologist for the first time tomorrow, so I'm not sure what to expect.  I was told no Rads or Chemo, but I guess it all depends on what she feels.  I really wish this journey was over as we all do.  ",
