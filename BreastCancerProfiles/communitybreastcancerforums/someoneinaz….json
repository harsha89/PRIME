      "Content": "someoneinaz wrote: I'm concerned for my wife and just want to ask a question here. My wife is 28 years old and a mother of one child. She has a lump about the size of a large pea that enlarges each month during her menstrual. Her OBGYN first said \"its just a cyst\" but then after the visit he instructed a nurse to order an ultrasound (didn't make sense, because he said \"its nothing\" during the visit). The ultrasound was \"clean\" and the diagnostic company wanted to order a mammogram because they couldn't find anything on the ultrasound (even though it was enlarged at the time). My wife, not wanting to get a mammogram at age 28 with a \"clean\" ultrasound, went to a new OBGYN for a 2nd opinion. The new doctor also said that it was likely a cyst and that \"the call was hers\" (my wife's) to have or not to have the mammogram. The first doctor who scared the dickens out of us then called my wife a couple weeks later wondering why she had not been back. Without seeing my wife a second time, he ordered her to see a surgeon. This was a bit over the top we both think, based on the advise of the second (new) OBGYN doctor and the fact that he had not seen her again since the \"clean\" ultrasound. Should we be concerned or does this monthly enlargement of a cyst sound typical at a young age? Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Well, that makes sense. She said \"why go to a guy who has the incentive to go after me with a knife?\". I don't have a good rebuttal. She's willing to have a biopsy I think. But if the surgeon is the only type of doctor who can do this, I don't know what to do for her.",
