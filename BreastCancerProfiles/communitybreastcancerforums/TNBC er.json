I was told that the RadOnc has changed his plan for me. Now I'm to have \"IMRT\" instead of \"3-D\". Does anyone know what this means? The marks they made on my neck are not on the lumps in my neck, but lower and more to the front of my neck. That seems weird to me! Anyway, we'll see what Monday brings.

It fits very snugly over one's face, and when they lock it down it makes you feel very vulnerable, as you can't move your head, or even twitch your nose! Due to the Avastin I'm on, I'm concerned I may need to dab my nose (it seems to constantly be damp) and won't be able to. Torture to have an itchy nose that you can't scratch. Well, Monday is the start, so we'll see how it all goes. Good luck with your treatments, everyone.",

Although my neck skin seems to be doing ok for now, my throat is another story all together! I can have severe pain when swallowing. Can't handle anything more than about half a dime sized mouthful at a time. It takes me forever to eat the little I do consume. I've lost six pounds in two weeks. Apparently I'm getting IMRT radiation, Which is more intense, but for a shorter duration, so I'll only need 15 to 20 instead of the original 30. That will take me through next week, I believe. I'm told the throat will get worse before it gets better, but that it will get better a few weeks after rads end. Oh well, at least I'm losing the weight I put on with the AIs I was on for two years.

Last question, is fatigue inevitable? I'm planning to do the radiation in the afternoons, so I can go to the office each morning, leave mid-afternoon, and then go home thereafter.
