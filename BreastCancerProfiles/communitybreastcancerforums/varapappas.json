After only a mammogram and ultrasound, md anderson was immediately talking to me about double mastectomy. At first this terrified me, but now that I've given it more thought, I think this is the best course for me. I do believe I need to avoid chemo and radiation to stay alive, so my current plan is to only do the double mas with reconstruction. I am still going through testing. I had an mri yesterday. I have had preliminary biopsy results and only know that I am IDC grade 2. I'm finally meeting doctors tomorrow and will hopefully have more info to flush out my decision. I'm TERRIFIED of surgery. My brother died at 32 from an infection he got from surgery, so I am aware of how deadly surgery is!! I need stories from those that have done double mas with reconstruction! I plan to do it at one time to aid in my mental health. I am only 33 years old, and feel like I am *just* starting to live my life, and I want to stay alive!! How is the recovery? For those that have trouble healing, what other things should I be aware of? How do you handle showers and day to day during recovery? How much bigger can you go? Cancer free with double mas alone? Please, let me know!! I need some hope, as well as awareness. Thanks!! Log in to post a reply",
