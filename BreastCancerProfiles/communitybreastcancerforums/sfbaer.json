She finished 18 of them and fatigue hits her very hard. It was a breeze for her 2.5 yrs ago, but this time the treatment started about 5 weeks after 5 rounds of high dosage T/C so perhaps the leftover chemo toxicity plus the radiation are too harsh for my mom to take. Both onc and radiiologist said it's side effect of radiatoin. The fatigue doesn't just make her tired but completely powerless, and she cries a lot due to that tired feeling. She says it feels like her arms are no longer attached to her body, as if she has been moving rocks for days. I hope my mom's case doesn't scare anyone of you who's going to start rads. It was really a breeze for my mom and so is a lot of women.",

I felt so bad few months ago when my mom was diagnosed the recurrence 2 years after her first bc. I felt like it's end of the world and so was she. But who knows? Who knows what's gonna happen. I'm not religious; I just think everyone has to leave this world one day. It can be any cause or reason. That's life. Most of us wish to live painlessly, but somehow it's just never the case. Call it fair or unfair - we just have to face and live with our pains, physically and  mentally. Don't you feel the love and care from your family and friends? Don't let them down and fight that bc as long as you still can. Next time you have your family meeting tell them how you feel and yell at them \"DON'T CRY!!!\"",
