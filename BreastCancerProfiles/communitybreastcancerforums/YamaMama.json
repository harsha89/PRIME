It's your call whether you want to be treated aggressively or not. It's your body. You make the decisions after your docs tell you what options you have. I know it feels like you need to rush to make decisions, but take a deep breath, and know that you have so much support right here along with a wealth of information from women who know first hand what the latest treatments are. And definitely go for the anxiety meds, and sleep meds too if you aren't sleeping.",

I was told once that having stage IV is like having a radio on constantly in every room you're in. Sometimes the music is so loud it's overwhelming.

My dear sweet wonderful husband, my love, best friend, and greatest supporter was diagnosed with leukemia one and a half years ago. He made it through a stem cell transplant and went into a remarkable remission.  He was doing great and then started having trouble breathing.  In September after a three short weeks in the hospital he died.  Some of the last things he said to me was that he wanted me to live. He wanted me enjoy every moment I could. He made me promise to go on, continue loving my family, and also to continue working. I struggle every day to stay in the moment. But it is crucial for me. It is crucial for my family.  I struggle with being here after almost 4 years and my husband's illness was short in comparison. Why is he gone? Why am I still here? So many questions. The reality is I will never know the answers.  Life is not always fair.  My onc said to me last week, that after so many years of treating people with cancer he still has no idea as to why bad things happen to good people. They just do. It is a conscious decision to find joy in each day. To surround myself with people that make me smile, that love me and bring positive energy to my day. I am not always successful. I have bad moments, and  bad days. But I like I said...it's a conscious decision. It's gotten easier with practice. Journaling has helped me. I journal about the bad times. But when I journal about the good things it really does help. I have had some days when the only good thing that happened was that I got up that morning. Or that my day at work was done, or that I got to speak to a precious grandchild on the phone.  But those little things...will someday be the big things.  Sleep is another big one. I always feel worse, more sad, more scared, when I haven't slept.  Ambien is my friend on those nights.  Take care of yourself.  A day at a time, and today is the only day to deal with right now.",

But a small area showed up in my colon which was removed during a colonoscopy and proved not to be breast mets, but a new primary colon cancer. I'm currently waiting to see if I'm going to need surgery for this or if the colonoscopy was enough to take care of it.  My docs have asked me about genetic testing in the past and so far I haven't done it. But now especially with this new diagnosis of a second cancer I'm considering it. I have children and want to be proactive for them. I'm wondering if anyone has any info to share about it?

I had melanoma found very early and removed about 15 years ago, then stage iv breast ca, and now colon ca. I am the only one in my family with any kind of cancer so I guess I've just hit the mother load and hopefully no one else has to go through this. I would like to have the testing done. My children are grown and either have families or are in the process of trying to have thier own children. Other than my fear that I have passed my cancer genetics on to them, I am most concerned about the implications (ie; future insurance coverages, life insurance etc...for them).  My docs are trying to tell me that with the new health care laws, my children will not be penalized due to pre-existing conditions. My children have already started screening due to having wonderful docs. And though my youngest daughter's insurance wouldn't pay for a mammogram because she is only 24 it did pay for a breast ultra sound which picked up a benign lump this past year.  So, I'm glad they are being proactive. As for the cost of the test, as long as there are no penalties for my children long term for having the test I'm all for it and I'll have it done even if I have to pay part of the cost. I'll be meeting with a genetics counselor after the holidays to discuss the details, but knew I'd gain some insight from you all here. Thanks again to all.",

But as a woman having BC and also I am a nurse, I can tell you that I think you should follow up on the lung shadow. If you are concerned, and you wouldn't ask if you weren't, then that's enough to warrant further eval. I really think you should ask your doc to refer you to a pulmonologist for evaluation. If only to give you peace of mind. You may have just had a touch of the flu or something that day...but...if you are worried, get it checked out, so you can relax about it. Best wishes for some peace of mind...",

Vicodin does not seem to help my discomfort either. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers.",
