Just a little history....I have been married to my hubby for almost 15 years, we have 2 amazing little girls...6 and 9. They are my world! January 5th of 2012 I felt a big lump on the top of my breast, pretty much on my chest (it was high up), and went to doctors...well long story short...grade 3+++ HER/PR/ER  actually 2 tumors, approximately 4 cm was the larger! What a shock that was! No family history, just had my female exam with breast exam 3 months earlier! So I was scheduled for Double Mastectomy 2/10/12, and on 2/8/12 I had a CT of my whole body, because i had been complaining of back pain! So they found a spot on my liver, 1.2 cm. Surgery was canceled and chemo started, TCH for 6 rounds. Had my last scan of my liver in Dec and they do not see anything! THANK YOU LORD!! Have another scan tonight, and it is almost 1 year to the day since that aweful scan! SO NERVOUS! My husband tries to stay positive, but he knows.... he came home and asked me about buying more life insurance! that conversation did not go over well! Love you all, Kristen",
