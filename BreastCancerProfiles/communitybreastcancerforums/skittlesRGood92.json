My story is complicated. my mother Karel, passed away when I was only 6-7 months old, leaving my dad alone and heartbroken with 4 kids all under 6 years old. me being the youngest and just a baby. When my mother was pregnant with me, she found a lump in her left breast and told her doctor about it because it concerned her. They ruled it out immediately as nothing but a swollen milk gland and moved on happily preparing for the baby. But the lump didn't go away and getting very close now to her due date, she was still worried because something didn't seem right, but still the doctors weren't worried. One day she woke up and there was discoloration and awful pain in her breast and she was finally able to get tests done. A couple of days later, she went into labor and I was born. As the family was gathered around happy and overjoyed, the doctor came in and gave her the terrible news that she had a very aggressive and late staged breast cancer.  Long story short, my mother went through treatment, had ups and downs, but ultimately it was just too far to snuff out and she didn't make it.  I've often been told that because my mom was so young (diagnosed with terminal cancer at 29 years old), that it is gravely important that I and my sisters get checked out regularly and have mammograms. We didn't do as we should, and i have been battling so many health issues over the last few years... I'm scared. I quit having my periods when I was 20. Three years sgo. I've suffered from terrible migraines for a long time. I can't seem to lose weight even through diet and exercise and i am the only one that I know of in my family who is overweight. I have awful joint pain. Usually its worse at night, and i havd a hard time sleeping. I've started having heart problems. Very rapid pulse, chest pain, tightness, sometimes difficulty getting air. I have abdominal pains. And horrible pain on rare occasions in my pelvic area that gets so severe I'm toppled over in a ball for a few minutes until it eases off..but im usually really sore in that area for 2 days afterwards.my doctors think i have ovarian cystsand will be doing an ovarian ultrasound to be sure none are malignant. When i was born, i had a birth mark on my chest in the exact location that my mother had her lump. I always thought that was special.  But as i matured the birth mark moved as my breasts grew, but strangly I have had a breast lump for a long time in my left breast in the exact same location as my moms. I find that very strange. I had a breast ultrasound and mammogram done and my doctor told me they saw something but its probably no big deal. My regular doctor told me a biopsy would be a waste of time because im so young but my mom had cancer in her 20s and with all my hormonal issues, itsseems crazy not to have a biopsy. But I'm not a doctor and I really just don'tknow what to do. Plus biopsies cost a lot of money  im having pains in that breast now, but no discoloration. My appetite is normal but when I try to eat, i get full very quickly and can not eat much at all.  I don't feel like my doctor is taking things serious  Log in to post a reply",
