      "Content": "Dec 1, 2014 12:22AM nottoday wrote: Hey Becca, I'm so sorry to hear about all you've been through. So glad that both your grandson and your son are doing well. Happy 55th birthday! Thank you for your perspective on the antidepressants. I'm still trying to figure out what to do. Wondering if I can plow through 2 more sessions - one on Wednesday and the last on Dec. 23, if all goes as planned. I don't particularly believe in needless anguish if there's something that can help. I am pasting something I found on another thread, originally from Huffington Post. Hope you find it as inspiring as I did. Hugs.  The Things I Wish I Were Told When I Was Diagnosed With Cancer by Jeff Tomszek Your relationships are about to change. All of them. Some will get stronger. They will probably not be with the people you would expect. The people you want to handle this well might not be able to for a variety of reasons. Some of the reasons will be selfish. Some of them will be entirely innocent and circumstantial. All of them will be forgivable because no one plans for cancer. Carrying bitterness or anger won't help your recovery. Fighting for anyone to stick with you won't cure you. Those who can, will. You will be determined to have more energy than you do. You will convince yourself that you are thinking straight, are able to handle all of this and do not need anyone. You will run out fuel. Your body will change first and your mind will follow. You won't lose your mind, memories or sensibility. It will all come back. But, you will be different. You will never have the same sense of self. You should embrace this. Your old self was probably really great. Your transformed self will be even better. Give into what is happening and trust it. You are going to feel fear. Even if you are normally stubborn, confident and seemingly invincible you will finally find yourself admitting that you are scared of something. Cancer is scary and incredibly confusing. The unknowing will eat at you worse than the disease itself. You'll need distractions. Music and sleep will probably be the ones you resort to most. Reading will become difficult. So will watching TV or movies, having conversations, writing and basically everything else. They call it \"chemo brain\" for a reason. You will feel normal eventually. Just a new kind of normal. When you feel afraid let yourself lean on those around you. Cry. Be vulnerable. You are vulnerable. There will be time for strength, but never admitting weakness will cause anxiety to mount and your condition to worsen. Let it all out. Yell if you need to. Sing when you feel up to it. Sob uncontrollably. Apologize for your mood swings. Treatments and prescriptions will often be the cause of them. The people that love you will understand. The people that love you will be just as scared as you are. Probably more. They will be worrying even when they are smiling. They will assume you are in more pain than you are. They will be thinking about you dying and preparing for life without you. They will go through a process that you will never understand just like they will never understand the process you are going through. Let them process. Forgive them when they don't understand. Exercise patience when you can. Know that those that were built for this will be there when you get to the other side and you will all be able to laugh together again. You'll cry together too. Then you'll get to a place where you will just live in the world again together and that is when you know that you have beaten this. The sooner you recognize that you are mortal, the sooner you can create the mentality for survival. There is a chance you might not make it. Just like there is a chance that you will. Don't look at statistics. You are unique and what is happening inside you is unique. Your fight is yours alone and there are too many factors to compare yourself to others that have had your condition. No one will want you to think about death, but you won't have a choice. You will think about it from the moment you are given your diagnosis. Come to terms with it. Calmly accept it. Then, shift every thought you have into believing that you won't die. You are going to beat this. Your mental focus on that fact will be more powerful than any treatment you receive. Your doctors and nurses will become your source of comfort. You will feel safe with them. If you do not feel safe with them you need to change your care provider immediately. There is no time to waste. This shouldn't be a game played on anyone's terms but yours. When you find the right caretakers you will know immediately. Do not let insurance, money or red tape prevent you from getting the treatment you deserve. This is your only shot. There is always a way. Find those hands that you trust your life in and willingly give it to them. They will quickly bring you a sense of calm. They will spend time answering your questions. There will be no stupid questions to them. They won't do anything besides make you feel like you are the most important life that exists. They will never make you feel like they don't have things in control. They will be honest and accessible at all times. They might even become your friends. You might celebrate with them over drinks months or years after they have cured you. They deserve your gratitude, respect and appreciation daily. If you get upset at them during treatment know that they'll forgive you. They get that you're going through something they can't imagine- but they understand better than anyone. They see it every day and they choose to be there because they want to make the worst experience of your life more tolerable. You will need to find balance after treatment. Start by seeking balance during treatment. Eat well. Sleep well. Listen to your body. Explore meditation. Experiment with new forms of exercise that aren't so demanding. Embrace massage and other body therapies. Go to therapy. A therapist will be able to guide you through your journey in ways you could never fathom. Do not be too proud to speak to someone. You cannot afford to store up the intensity of the emotion that comes with fighting a life-threatening illness. Let it out for yourself. You will begin to hear your voice changing. That voice is who you are becoming in the face of mortality. Listen to that voice. It will be the purest, most authentic version of you that you have ever known. Bring that person into the world -- strengths and vulnerabilities and everything between. Be that person forever. You will inspire others. It will feel weird. People you haven't spoken to since grade school will be in touch. Ex-girlfriends, former colleagues... even people you felt never wanted to talk to you again. The influx of interest in your seemingly fading life will be greater than any living moment you have ever experienced. That support is what will shift a fading life into a surviving one. Be grateful for every message. Be appreciative of each gift and each visit. There will be moments where all of this attention will make you feel lonelier than you have ever felt in your life. In a hospital room full of people with messages stuffing your inbox, voicemail and mailbox you will find yourself feeling completely alone. This is when you will realize that you could afford to have a stronger relationship with yourself. That only you walk this earth with 100% investment in you. Make the investment and use this as an opportunity to reexamine your self-worth. Love yourself more than ever and recognize how much love there is for you in the world. Then start sharing that love. You will come to see that even when you are the neediest person you know you can still be giving. Giving will make you feel better than taking. When you get to the other side you won't believe it. They will tell you the disease is gone. Everyone you know will rejoice and return back to their lives. You'll constantly wonder if it is coming back. Slowly this feeling will fade, but cancer will always be a part of you. It will define how you see the world moving forward. You're going to feel like the future is a funny thing to think about because the present is going to suddenly seem incredibly important. Keep moving. You'll be more productive. You'll understand who truly loves you because they will still be there. You'll want to meet new people that connect to the newly evolved version of your old self. You'll want to let go of those that don't \"get\" who you are now. You'll feel a little guilty doing it. Then, you'll move on. You don't have time to waste. The greatest gift you've been given is that you now understand that and you're going to make the most of every second. You're going to be the most passionate person you know going forward. Translate that passion to a greater purpose. Be fearless again.  ",

I had to have a PICC line installed just before the infusion because doses 2 and 3 both took out a vein, and left red stains on my skin. Those are starting to fade. The PICC line installation went well and the infusion nurses removed it at the end. Don't worry if you have to go through this. My MO didn't want to do a port for 4 infusions and said my reaction to the taxotere - the vein loss - was unusual. And then, I got to ring the bell! Didn't know whether to laugh or cry - laughing won. My husband got teary. He's been such a rock. Boy, we've all been through a lot, haven't we? Came home and was sound asleep by 9 p.m. Slept until 8 a.m. And it was wonderful sleep (aided by half a zanax), not one of those wake up every 3 hours and check your e-mails kind of sleep. And then I took a nap from 9:30 to 11:30 this morning. Hope I can muster the energy to wrap Christmas presents! Cherice - sending loving thoughts your way today from East Coast to West, and Mandy and Tobycc, same for you onr Friday! Nancy - congrats on the taxol part - my infusion nurse yesterday said herceptin is much easier. Becca - glad you are (re)covered for zofran. Not sure what we would do without that miracle drug. Regarding fatigue, I've learned to write off at least 5 days and nap as much as possible. And then afterwards, I still go to bed earlier. Seems like I can feel fine one moment and comatose the next. But I figure it's good for my body to help cope with the chemo-terrorists within. And luckily, I have the world's kindest boss and colleagues, who have allowed me the time I need to recover, and, on the other hand, welcome my participation when I'm able. I'm looking forward to feeling stronger and working harder, and paying them back. To anyone I've left out - I'm cheering for you. And I'm wishing for us all peaceful holidays and a healthy 2015.",

I was too tired to sit up! (No one seemed to know!) Tomorrow is the 2nd infusion (out of 4). I feel more comfortable with it now because I know what to expect. Today is a holiday from work and I'm gathering my supplies for the next few days: lots of chicken soup (figured out last time I really have to baby my stomach for about 2 weeks), Powerade (I've developed an addiction to this stuff), apples to make applesauce, saltines, homemade hummus, dried fruits and nuts. I'm cranking up the humidifier to prevent last sessions' bloody noses, and preparing for lots of naps. I'll squeeze in as much yoga as I can, try to walk 30 minutes a day, and meditate. I read all of your messages, and I really appreciate knowing you are with me out there, on a similar journey. llovecoaster, loved the message about your hairdresser.

Normally, I would have stopped the steroids entirely on the night of the 24th, but I continued to take a quarter dose Thursday-Saturday and then 1/8 dose on Sunday. I wanted to see if it would ease the Neulasta achiness. Well, it definitely did that. I felt good on those days. However, I was very hyper and did not sleep much, even at 1/8 dose. My husband and daughter would go off to sleep at night, and I'd still be puttering around. I decided that my body needed more rest, so stopped entirely after Sunday. After I stopped taking them, I still had some lingering achiness that is clearing up. And I think I pulled a muscle in my lower back, perhaps due to some overly zealous working out while on the steroids. So, in conclusion, prolonging the steroids was good and bad. It was nice to have some pizzazz on Christmas Day. But not sure being hyper is such a good thing when our bodies really need rest. I'm still trying to get back into regular sleep rhythms. I've been reading some books about cancer that I've enjoyed: \"Anticancer: A new way of life\" and \"Just get me through this: A practical guide to coping with breast cancer.\" And because reading only about cancer gets boring: \"Citizens of London: The Americans who stood with Britian in its darkest, finest hour.\" Today is Dec. 31. Usually I feel a bit sad to leave the old year behind, but I cannot wait to drop-kick this one into oblivion. Wishing you strength and courage as you finish your treatments and a really great 2015.

I'm a little nervous about feeling sick, but today I feel quite good, and I'll take a Zofran in the morning, I guess, to stave off any nausea. All in all, looking forward to being at work. I'll just need to get up and move a lot - my job is very chair-bound! I wanted to let you know about a couple of cookbooks I've used and distributed to friends who've expressed an interest in cooking for me during chemo. They are both by Rebecca Katz: The Cancer-Fighting Kitchen, and One Bite at a Time. Both have yummy, healthy recipes. I've identified recipes that my family and I would enjoy, and it has been a nice way to work with friends and family who want to support us.  Llovecoasters, I took in a bag of dried fruit and nuts and munched on it during chemo, along with chocolate, cause everybody knows I love that. My nurse said a light meal before was OK. I hope everything goes well tomorrow. I think the infusions have gone well for most of us. We'll be waiting for you on the other side! sjacobs 146, I've been told that heartburn is part for the chemo course. I've been taking 1 CVS-brand omprazole every day - so far so good. I've had minor bone pain since my injection on Thursday, and I guess the claritin 24 and ibuprofen are helping, but I find that brief yoga and walking sessions (10 min each) are really helpful.  wendeeB, you are amazing and inspiring! All I can say is, \"wow!\"  cbooklvr, I spent a lot of years in Berkeley and still miss it. Hope you are doing well. Wishing you all a good week. ",

But you will find lots of help and comfort here. I found a great list on one of these discussion boards about what to shop for before starting chemo. You will see other ideas posted in this October thread and others. And in addition to this thread, you may want to post with the December group as well. Chemo is doable. And, we're with you!",

Nancy: congrats on finishing the taxol - you must be relieved! Hope you recover well from shoulder surgery and get help with the blood clot. Geez, what a year. I don't know about you, but I rarely visited a doctor before my diagnosis in July and took no meds on a regular basis. Now, I have to write down all the meds I'm taking so I won't forget any and I feel like I might as well pitch a tent in the center where I'm receiving care. Hope we all have a very healthy and uneventful (medically speaking) 2015!",

I still have a sore lower back from thinking I could do some leg lifts my muscles weren't prepared for. But, most of all, congrats on finishing! I bet your nails will be back in good shape before long. I did cold caps and am watching my brunette hair turn quite gray as it grows out. When I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm meeting someone new. But, it's OK. I'm a grandmother now, and I'm looking like one. Lost hair many other places, and everyday, I examine all parts for growth, but haven't seen any new hair, yet. llovecoasters: I did the bell ringing with my husband and our friend, who helped us with cold caps. It gave me something to look forward to. But I can see how it wouldn't work for everyone, and I worried some that there were people there in the infusion center (which is huge so all kinds of patients), who might not have the opportunity. I bet you and your DH could find a great, alternative way to honor this milestone. On Monday, I'm having gallbladder surgery. Not at all related to chemo, just happened to discover gallstones during it. Yikes. I've always prided on being so healthy. Now, I think I might as well pitch at tent at that hospital. Happy weekend, all. ",
