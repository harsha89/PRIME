I had a tram flap and breast was reconstructed.Â  At the time when all of this was happening my dad died from bowel cancer. Now I've been good health wise and all these years later and have done my 5 years on tamoxifen and have been advised to carry on taking it for another 5 years. My mother is terminal from secondary breast. I am waiting to see a genetic counsellor. I am now faced with seriously considering having a mastectomy and implant put in to relieve my mental stress from wondering about cancer ever coming back. I was wanting to see is anyone in the forum been faced with a situation like this. Log in to post a reply",
