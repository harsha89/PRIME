Did my own hy hygiene but I did sit on a shower chair in front of the sink while I brushed my teeth and wash my face and a few other parts. I fed myself and comb my hair. The nurses would get me fluids in my food change my bedding. But I did most of things on my own period was an easy and I was sore and stiff but the pain meds kept everything under control to where I could tolerate it. And I do not have a high pain tolerance if I have a low pain tolerance so I was expecting to be worse off than I was. Everyday got a bit better. Do as much as you can and get out walking by day three. Also do lots of deep breathing exercises. Everybody heals fferently and I think everybody's going to have a different experience. I've been lucky so far knock wood. I'll be watching for your results and how you're doing and sending you good wishes and a healthy quick recovery. Keep asking any questions that you need I know how difficult it is before surgery. I was hoping it would be a lot better mentally after surgery. The first day coming home with hard I had a pity party but today I'm a little more emotionally okay. Still waiting for my final pathology results and I'll have another pity party",

So many other stage threes here and are doing well. Even the ladies with stage 4s. I too am awaiting surgery and don't know about spread. It can be very stressful to wait. I've had multiple melt downs over the last couple of months. I have two IDC same breast and am getting BMX with Diep same day in may 18. So afraid to hear the pathology after. Told it can change from what they suspect even though I have had two ultrasound and a MRI. Hang in there and keeping chatting with the group. It will help and these ladies and fellows are a greAt support group.",

After she did through my IV I asked her what she gave me and she told me versed and fentanyl and I said to her \"so I'm not going to remember soon\" and she said \"that's the plan\", was the last thing I remembered.¬† Was wonderful. Just let your anesthesiolgoitst know how anxious you are when you see her/ him and they should help you with that. Also a good idea to let them know if you get very nauseated after anesthesia as they can make a cocktail while you are under to help with that. Mine tried but I still got sick. She came to see me the next day and asked how she did on the nausea front, I told her I vomited. She was disappointed and said \"the only thing I didn't try was Maxeran!\" I thanked her for the Versed and Fentanyl and she said it usually works. Versed is a memory reversal and fentanyl is a pain reliever, the mix helps to calm and put you out sort of. Good Luck, will be thinking about you",

Yes alnd, it was because I had a focal extranodal extension, only a couple of cells that put me out of the \"rads only\" group. however it looks like today and according to Dr. Notes from the tumour board the plan will be to get the chemo first then surgery after so will give me a bit more healing time. That is unless the BS can fit me in within two weeks. So not sure why i'd have alnd after chemo when it may clear everything up? Oh well, just hope these docs know what they are doing.

No history of injury. Pain comes in waves at times then it will be fine for hours. I was just dx with BC 3 months ago and the pain really hasn't worsened. I hear knee Mets is rare but is there anyone out there who had knee Mets and knows what it feels like? My massage therapist thinks it is a MCL strain but he finds it odd that it has lasted so long. No stability issues no weakness I appreciate your help",

When going home they fill in doc wanted to send me home with Hydromorphone tablets which I hadn't even been taking. So I told him no I did not want that it made me nauseous but if he could give me a few Tylenol 3 just to get me through some nights it would be helpful. He said no that he probably just give me some regular extra strength Tylenol so I thought that might be ok. Anyhow in the end I noticed on our way out the pain team had already prepared a prescription for Tylenol threes so confusing. Suboxone should only be taken when you're starting to go through withdrawal you don't take it before a withdrawal. Which I'm sure your Suboxone provider will tell you that. I think the best advice was to get your surgeon either your plastic surgeon or a breast surgeon to communicate with the Suboxone provider and work out a good plan or as someone said maybe perhaps stay in the hospital longer to manage your pain. There are a lot of people out there who are recovering from opiate addictions and more and more Health Care Providers are learning how to deal with this. It is not fair, just or right to send the patient home in pain which could be managed. I hope all goes well with you and good luck. My pain would have been somewhat bearable without the t 3 s at night but the pain is so much better with them to help me sleep comfortably",

I am glad you are responding because I am so upset and this does help. the radiologist stated just to check it with future testing. I have both my BS and PS nurses planning to discuss with the doctors and see what they think ; however they are both in long surgery today so wont probably hear anything back until tomorrow. nice to be able to talk to someone about my worry. :)",

Everyone was positive things would be ok with me as well, then bomb dropped.

I don't know if that's because my mindsets knowing that I'm now done and I can look to start feeling better again? So this last one I had to explode the waist but this time I took Claritin and lo and behold it work! Too bad I didn't know that 3 infusions prior! Oh well it's the last one wasn't as bad. I did get nausea and vomiting from the taxol 2 days post infusion period stomach will help some. At least I wasn't nauseous all day. It just came on fairly suddenly and then it went away. We have a bell at our chemotherapy room and boy I certainly did ringgit! I got a little overwhelmed and choked up which I didn't expect so bring some tissues with you when you do ring that Bell you may need them. Hoping all of you that get chemo this week have minimal side effects and that the next few weeks fly by before you get to ring the bell",

Just started using my home gym yesterday. Haven't been at it since diagnosis last March. Could only do 10 min on elliptical then weights for about 10 minutes. Figure I'll start out with ten and increase it weekly. Appetite good unfortunately. Stull have numbness to my right thumb and index finger. Trying to lose weight now. Am 30 lbs over. Went to Niagara falls last week for a two night vacation. Was cold but nice. Tried my first glass of wine since diagnosis and didn't like it! So drank ice tea the rest of the trip. Bought some cider from a little vineyard and chocolate from a chocolate factory. Still having more surgery ALND Nov 30 then rads mid January. I think I'll be the last one to do that in this group. Congratulations Paulette and lojo! Here's to moving ahead. Who else finishes this week?  ",
