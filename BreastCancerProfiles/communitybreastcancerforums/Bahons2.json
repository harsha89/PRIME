I do 'google' it from time to time, but at the moment there is a charge for the abstract and I haven't taken it any further.  Obviously Sorafenib is a very powerful drug indeed (with some nasty side effects), and I can't see it being prescribed -  yet -  for lymphoedema in its current form.  I am waiting to see if anything new about it pops up in the public domain.

I asked her for a copy of his reply as I thought it was very useful to carry with me for hospital visits/stays. Here's what he wrote: 'It should be possible to monitor her blood pressure measured at the ankle. This can be checked by putting a cuff around her thigh and listening in the popliteal fossa (for non-automatic devices). Generally blood pressures measured distally are around 10 mmHg systolic higher than centrally measured BP. This is because the pressure wave form changes on passing into smaller arteries, in much the same way as waves become higher and steeper when they pass into shallow water'. So that's how they can do it - in their own language! However, I too find thigh cuffs uncomfortable and it's perfectly possible, with an automatic device, for them to put an arm cuff around the lower calf and take a reading from there. X S X S",

Whether Avastin ultimately proves to be a weapon in the fight against lymphoedema or just another red herring, I think it will be an absolute tragedy if this study doesn't get off the ground simply for lack of  volunteers. This is because all the wrong messages will be sent out to the wider world.  Such as: An assumption that if they cannot get enough volunteers, there obviously aren't that many people suffering with it in the first place.  WRONG. Another might be that if they cannot get enough volunteers, it doesn't bother sufferers enough for them to want to assist in finding effective treatments/a cure.  WRONG (I hope). World-wide, there isn't nearly enough research into lymphoedema; if this scheme doesn't take place, there will be even less.  I do sympathise with the fear of side effects.  High pressure, for example, is a well known consequence of receiving Avastin, but can be managed with tablets and I understand that it often falls when a course of Avastin is completed. I loathe lymphoedema with every fibre of my being and if it wasn't a geographical impossibility for me to take part, I'd have volunteered.   I ain't gonna die wondering!",

I am a member of the French Lymphoedema Patients support organisation (AVML) and their latest newsletter mentioned Dr Becker.  From this I gathered that the results ARE good, with very few patients registering no improvement at all, but those selected may not be totally representative, as the lymphoedemas, were, I believe, not the biggest and relatively recent. I think the signs are excellent tho', that this technique will be refined and improved in the years to come and I hope that one day I'll be able to take advantage of it.  In a way, I wouldn't want to be one of the 'early' ones - I'd like someone who'd had loads of practice to do mine!
