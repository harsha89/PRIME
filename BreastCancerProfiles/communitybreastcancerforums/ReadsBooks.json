It was devastating, of course and I've been on an emotional rollercoaster. Just sold our house (more stress) and can't yet live in my new house due to renovations (more stress). I'm staying with friends now. Situation: I had 3-D mammo in mid-July; followed-up with more images and ultrasound. Radiologist also came in to look at US and do her own views. Decided she didn't want to \"leave it in there without knowing what it is.\" She described it as \"tiny, solid with irregular edges, but no blood flow.\" I have an appointment on August 18 for yet another diagnostic mammo at the cancer hospital, then an appointment with the surgical oncologist. I've had biopsies in the past, but was never sent straight to an oncologist appointment. Is this new (my last surgical biopsy, negative, was eight years ago)...or, does it mean the radiologist thinks this is cancer? Thanks Log in to post a reply",

My online chart has two entries for my two mammogram results, but NOTHING is given at all for me to see. The \"details\" section is totally blank. The official letter said only \"suspicious findings.\" It's especially stressful doing this without my husband's support and that's why I reached out to this forum. It's been a difficult time...in spring 2014, in my husband's last days, I had to have a needle biopsy to my right thyroid. It was benign. I had MOHs surgery on my right nostril last August to remove a basal cell carcinoma. I also have a bone spur in my hip that popped up and makes walking difficult. It's been an avalanche of health problems for me ever since my husband's diagnosis in October 2013. I know caregiving and grief are stressful, but I never imagined that my body would start falling apart on me! I've never been on any meds, not overweight, nor too thin. Thank you!",

(I'd had a 3-D and follow-up 3-D, and ultrasound at a radiology-only clinic and was referred to the hospital for a biopsy). The hospital informed me that they couldn't compare 2-D to 3-D images, so those 3-D images were worthless to them and that's why they did a 2-D mammo today. Then, the radiologist did an ultrasound. She said she couldn't find the \"suspicious area\" in her 2-D or ultrasound images. She concluded that there was no suspicious place now, it was gone, and told me to come back in a year. Next, I saw the NP for surgical oncology. She did a breast exam and read the radiologists conclusion. Nothing to biopsy. So...now I have two different types of mammograms from two different radiologists with two different conclusions. Were the 3-D and ultrasound both showing a false positive? Or, was there a cyst that disintegrated since July 27? To me, there was a difference in the way I was imaged. At the radiology clinic, there was much more compression and more views compared to today's mammo. First time I'd had a mammo without pain was today (but, I took an Excedrin Migraine tablet for a headache before going). Also, at the radiology clinic, the radiologist pressed down into the breast during the ultrasound to manipulate and locate the spot shown on the 3-D image. Today, the radiologist lightly glided over the skin. Should I be happy and let it go until next year? Thanks for listening.",
