I was living in London, England and was planning to start a new life with my family in Singapore in December. We brought the move forward- with kids in tow, and decided that I should have my treatment here. The last couple of weeks have been a blur. I am having pre-adjuvant chemo to shrink my 2x3 cm tumour, so that I can avoid a mastectomy! Have had my first round of chemo...and so far the only symptoms I have had are occasional feelings of tiredness and slight feelings of nausea. (Reading through some of the posts, I should count myself lucky!). Hubby is worried that the drugs might not be working! Is there anyone else out there whose symptoms have not been as bad as expected? My oncologist however,has warned me that my hair will definitely be falling out around the beginning of December- but I am prepared with wig in hand! It's nice to know that I'm not alone in this fight. ",

I arrived with a bad cough, due to the cold , miserable weather in London -  and this was prior to my first bout of chemo. I am now 10 days into the cycle and the cough has persisted. My throat is dry and I have to strain to speak; like I've lost my voice. Could this be what your doctor calls 'Chemo cough'? Even though I had the injection to boost my white blood cells, my white blood cell count is currently low- from a peak of 9000+ to a low of 2000+. My oncologist reassures me that my white blood cell count will rise again, but do you think that this low blood cell count could be a contributory factor to my cough persisting in the manner that it is? I haven't had any side-effects to the injection, but having said that, when I wore my heels the other day, I did experience some lower back pain, pain which I don't normally experience when wearing such shoes! Will check to see if they sell Thera Flu cough and cold here. Take care. ",
