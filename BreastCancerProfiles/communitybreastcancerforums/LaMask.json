I can't promise whether it is completely safe for use during therapy, but it's just shea butter and beeswax infused with oxygen, so I assume it is... The oxygen eliminates odor by oxidizing the bacteria that cause it in the first place. It lasts longer than 6 months with me and they guarantee your satisfaction. Check it out at http://OzoneDeodorant.com",
