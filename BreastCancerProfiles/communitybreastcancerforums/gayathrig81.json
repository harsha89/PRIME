She called me from her flight. She didn't get any details from the nurse. I don't anything. What should I expect! How soon she she start treatment? What should i ask the nurse tomorrow when i call to ask for details? My mom is 51 and she is the best mom. I cannot see her go through this. I just hope and pray she gets well soon.
