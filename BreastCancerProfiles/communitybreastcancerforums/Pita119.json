She said that if I was going to panic every time I had my mammos/other needed testing, then she recommended the mastectomies. But If I was ok with the follow up needed, then lumpectomy with radiation was what she would recommend. Since my BC was small, stage 1, no lymph node involvement, neg. BRCA1 & BRCA2, I was ok with doing the lumpectomy. Also, having to deal with this with both my mother & maternal grandmother & working in the medical field, I am comfortable with the process but struggled with the waiting of results. I did a lot of research & asked a lot of questions and think that really helped me. I know that I will be always looking over my shoulder with this & my BS said she still puts me in about the 15-18% recurrence range but I have seen the progress made over the years with testing & treatment options & will always be in charge of my health & on top of it. Wishing all my rad friends a very HAPPY, SAFE & HEALTHY 2015!!! ",

I had my 11th rad today with 9 more to go then I will be on Arimidex for 5 years with the possibility of another 5 years on a different AI. All of these women on these forums are amazing...each one traveling their own, very different journey that they are willing to share to help others and I really do appreciate it. It is a place to ask questions, vent, rant, and yes, even bitch but it has given me a sense of peace to know that I am not alone. It has been a very long 5 months for me and I hope that once I'm done radiation and start the hormone therapy that I don't have to deal with BC again.",

I was looking through the thousands of pictures that I haven't organized all my life and got very weepy when I came across the ones of my mother's 70th birthday party that I threw for her. She battled breast cancer for 18 years but was a true fighter. I laughed a little when I found the invitation that I sent out inviting her family & friends to an \"antique\" party. Life really is not fair. We can't change what happens to us. I just reread a book that made me laugh. It's called \"The Interuption of Everything\" by Terry McMillan. She is one feisty lady but her story lines are great & she writes with a lot of humor. Maybe it would help your mood. I will keep you in my thoughts & prayers that this cloud lifts for us so that we can enjoy life and being healthy. ",

I would also document everything that your supervisor does regarding how you are being treated and save all emails, correspondence informing her about upcoming appts, etc. Maybe you can mention also to your union rep the constant coverage of the office that you provide to the point that you can't even take a lunch, and are not paid for the extra time that you work...I think that's a no no in the union world. I took a leave of absence from my job when I was dx'd. I was very fortunate that I didn't need chemo and the SEs of the radiation weren't terrible for me. I got a little pink by the second week. I had a few days of real fatigue but not the whole time I was being treated. I am now 11 days out from my last treatment & my skin did blister and get a little sore. I've been using Cocoa Butter with Vit E as per my RO. Everyone, from what I've heard & read reacts differently to the treatments. Will keep you & your situation in my thoughts & prayers. Just keep in touch. CoyoteNV...thank you for your comments. I've never thought about painting a gourd...may just try it. When it comes to the painting, I don't like doing any of the base coating so painting walls is not fun for me. But I do like doing the detail painting...I take pictures during the different stages of my painting & I am always amazed at how a little bit of detail can really make a piece.",

But like you said, laying on that table today and watching the machine circle around me administering the radiation to kill the left over cancer cells just kind of got to me. And the fact that they had screwed up the schedule...my appt was supposed to be 9:10 and when I was still waiting 1 hr. after my appt time & watching other women who came in way after me go back...I asked why I was still waiting, the girl told me my appt was 10:30. I didn't have the print out of my appt times with me but I was quite annoyed since I knew my appt. was 9:10. Good thing they don't take blood pressure @ these appts.

Both my estrogen & progesterone came back pos >90% and the Her2 came back neg +1. I was told that since my levels were pos with high %, that my tumor needed the estrogen to grow so therefore hormone therapy (arimidex) would be part of my treatment as that stops the estrogen that is produced in my body. This information is important for the drs. to decide on what kind of treatment is best for the specific cancer. I've heard of women having more than one type of BC but everyone is so different and their cancer behaves so differently, it's difficult to predict who will have a recurrence & who won't. My BS told me that even though my genetic testing came back neg., my onco score was 9 and recurrence prediction 7%, with my family history she thinks my recurrence risk falls into about the 18% range. Over the years, I have done everything plus some to head this off. I had my yearly mammos, had 2 clinical exams every year, did self breast exams monthly and even took Tamoxifen for 5 years preventivly when I was in my 40's and still developed it. So I just keep focusing on that we live in a country where access to healthcare is excellent, treatment options are many and are improving daily, and my cancer was caught early. If I should have a recurrence, it is out of my control. I just need to listen to my body and stay in control of my health. Hope this helps :)",
