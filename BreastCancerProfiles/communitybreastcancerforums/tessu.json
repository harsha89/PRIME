But so far I've just been extremely tired. The long-acting antinausea meds seem to he working, and these new drugs did not cause the awful headaches that started with every Taxotere infusion and lasted a week and a half. Also, brain fog doesn't seem so bad. I know, early days. I was a little panicked, because apparently Neulasta isn't routinely given here with FEC, but I pushed for and got a prescription. Then during wee hours wake up, started thinking maybe there was a good reason they didn't usually give Neulasta with FEC... (maybe your brain also creeps over to The Dark Side when you can't sleep and you understand?). Well, luckily I got in touch with the oncologist-on-call, who saw I had an admit for fever and neutropenia despite Neulasta after my first round of chemo, also that I'm getting the high-dose FEC, and she said yes definitely take the Neulasta! I honestly do not know what I would do without the support of these forums. I am still in shock over my life being cut so short so suddenly :( Thank you so much for answering :)",

They cleared slowly; I ended up in the ER with a lung CT showing NO blood clots or obviois lung tissus issues, so my MO wants me to take the Neulasta again this cycle, despite the company's website stating do not take it if you get those symptoms....MO said she would otherwise cut the chemo doses if I refused Neulasta because of the sepsis risk --- nope, no dose cuts, not with my aggressive cancer....

Nurses's station in front, 8 - 10 patients per room, and movable privacy screens open at the front around each bed and recliner (you can choose which you want each time). Another screen in front during iv insertion etc. for total privacy, also a couple times when I was sobbing. Given a choice, I would opt for group chemo again instead of a single room all alone. (I never had anyone willing to be there with me). With the group rooms, nurses see and help you immediately if any problems crop up. Nobody with chest colds, flu, etc. gets chemo, and the nurses always use gloves. I seriously doubt chemo in this type of group setting raises infection risk. As far as privacy issues, you don't have to strip for chemo. nly my arm was exposed during chemo; had to expose my thigh for the year of Herceptin injections, but had the screens all around for those. You are just at the start of your treatments. The women on this site are a wonderful source of support and practical information. Maybe search for and join a thread by women starting chemo May 2017 (I'm sure there's one) to meet women at a similar stage of treatment? I wouldn't have made it through without my chemo buddies here! Wishing you well (((hugs))) ",

I wish none of you had to deal with this crappy disease. Breast cancer has no mercy --- strikes at random, and is NOT YOUR FAULT AT ALL so don't even think of blaming yourself. Stress does NOT cause it, depression does not cause it, and you can do all you can think of to live a healthy life, but if breast cancer is going to hit, it will. So no self-blaming! (Saying this because I started out blaming myself for putting up with stress I could have walked away from...). This site is packed with tons of practical information about how to deal with treatment side effects, that no one at my hospital ever mentioned. But more importantly, the emotional support from the other women here, women who've walked or are walking the same path as you, will be priceless. Absolutely the best. I'm one of those with a completely unsupportive spouse (some people just don't \"get\" that cancer is serious and its treatment can be rough), but yes I was able to tough it through the harder days thanks very much to encouragement from the wonderful Sept 2015 women. And you all will help each other through your own rough spots --- which I hope will be very mild for you, and very rare. Others have already posted this here, but it is so important I'm repeating: Chemo, surgery, and radiation side effects ARE NOT caused by you worrying about them, and CANNOT be completely avoided by just deciding that you won't get them. Sorry. I so wish it were that easy :( So if your body does suffer from the life-saving treatments you are going through, please don't blame yourself (or your body). Focus instead on getting the rest and any medical help you need to heal. I used cold caps and still lost almost all my hair (except for very very sparse gray fluff) --- but it is all growing back :) The anti-nausea drugs available today are AMAZING! Puking my guts up was one of my main fears, but over the entire course of chemo, I only did that twice, and one of those was most likely from something I ate :) My chemo nurses said take them when you even think that you maybe might be starting to feel nauseous, because prevention is easier, and they were very right :) Anyone getting TAXOTERE (docetaxel): I wish I had been given cold gloves and cold socks during all my Taxotere infusions: taxotere can cause peripheral nerve damage, which hit all my fingers after the first dose as pain, redness, swelling, then numbness. Cold treatments during the infusion can lessen or even prevent this. Luckily at one year out all that's left is mild numbness at the fingertips. But I so wish the clinic had \"remembered\" to give me the cold pretectors right from the start. Also: if any of you start to get swelling and/or a \"heavy\" feeling or pain in your operated arm --- especially the inner part of you upper arm --- please have your doc and/or nurse check you for possible lymphedema (LE) --- even if you had no lymph nodes or just a few nodes or even just the one sentinal node removed. The earlier LE is identified and treated, the easier it is to control. LE is a pain in the b*tt, but yes one can learn to live with it. This site has a fantastic lymphedema forum filled with excellent advice, so if you have any suspicions you might be developing LE, do check it out! Yes, you've probably got some rough times ahead. Cancer is serious and needs to be hit hard. I wish all of you strength and courage through the next year --- you can do this!!!",

Ordering from the US would cost a fortune with customs, and returning poorly fitting goods even more. Don't trust the hospital PT's measurements, nothing she has gotten me fits. Because of distance and current infection risk, I cannot get to the one store in the capital city until mid-to late- January. I am sick of having narcotics level chest LE pain in my scar area. So --- after reading tons of product descriptions, I just cut up the Tram compression belt from immediate post-op and made SOMETHING. As it closes with velcro, it is very adjustable. The lining shell is leftover polyester stretch batting from making kids' clothes, needs tweaking. The straps attached with velcro in the front and will need finishing!, after I make sure of placement and length by wearing for awhile. Might have to scoop the armpit area more. And although I'm B cup and was told post-op that squashing the remaining breast is not harmful, I will probably try to cut a hole and attach an old bra cup (too tired now). It's not \"pretty\" but if it decreases the pain and doesn't worsen my arm/hand/finger LE, I don't care. Laughter is allowed . ;)    ",

When diagnosed summer of 2015, I desperately wanted the healthy breast removed because I was scared of getting breast cancer in that, too. The surgeon said I was too thin for own-tissue recon; unfortunately she delayed surgery a week because she would not believe I did not want any recon at all if the only option involved having an implant. (All the women in my local bc group have had recon, so it's \"normal\" here). The delay freaked me out because of the very aggressive pathology in my biopsy. The surgeon left extra tissue because \"of course you will change your mind later\"; I wish she had not, because it rubs on the armhole part of bras (when I wear them) and that hurts. Although thank heavens I've gotten the LE on my mastectomy side (hand, arm, chest wall) under pretty good control, I'm not willing to risk getting LE on the other side, too, from surgery to remove the healthy breast. So that one stays unless it cancer shows up there, too. Even fairly well-controlled LE sucks. Also, I read recently that removing the healthy breast would does not prolong survival (except in certain types of bc, not mine). I'm only a B-C cup but the silicone protheses for the mastectomy bra are too heavy and hurt. And the nerve pain in the scar hasn't yet completely gone away, so all bras hurt, even with a soft fluffy foob. And cancer treatment and all the suffering from its side effects has made me \"a bit\" selfish --- so if I don't feel like wearing an uncomfortable bra/prothesis (most of the time LOL), I simply don't, and if that shocks anyone, that's their problem, not mine. Yes, I've ditched most of my tighter tops, and yes I use scarves etc, and yes, for special functions (going to a wedding the end of this month) I'll wear the foob to not draw extra attention to myself. But actually nobody seems to have noticed at all when I go out lopsided. Or maybe they just don't care :) If you're reading this thread you're probably trying to decide what's right for you. As many have posted above, you can always change your mind, and possibly do recon later -- or not. One thing I did not know at the start is that a lot of recon styles involve multiple surgeries --- do you really want to soend that uch time recovering from operations? --- make sure you get all the information before you decide! I hope whatever you choose, that your surgery goes very well and that you're happy with the final results :)",

The sizing chart sounds like it accommodates edema fluctuations. I gave up wrapping yesterday; after three tries (each take me about an hour) couldn't get it to feel right. The complete system you are using would have helped. I am also considering the Caresia system that you still have to wrap over; have to find out if that is also day AND night use, and whether it can be used for variable amounts of edema. With wrapping, it's the stupid superlon foam roll sheets that drive me the most crazy, can't get them on without foldy bumps without putting some tension, and I think that's what's been making the whole wrap too tight. The all-in-one unit would be easiest, but I could live with still needing the short-stretch layer. Complicated.

I had right mastectomy with 9 nodes out (all clear) the end of August, chemo every three weeks starting 3 weeks post-op, and developed truncal then operated arm/hand lymfedema about 3 weeks ago. The hospital physical therapist has not been much help regarding using the arm, exercises, etc, but did say elevation as much as possible. She gave a Jobst Bella Lite sleeve and poorly fitting Lymed glove for daytime. The glove rubbed the skin open between my thumb and finger, so I had to stop all compression for almost a week (sleeve alone balloons my hand), but a better Jobst glove arrived yesterday. Whether I'll get a vest for my truncal lymfedema is still open (hope so --- it hurts, especially late afternoon/evening when it gets worse). My question: apparently in Finland nothing is worn for night compression. My swelling worsens at night, especialy in my hand, even though I sleep with the affected side up, arm on a pillow. From these forums it seems you USA ladies do have night compression garments. Should I just order a lighter compression level sleeve/glove for night wear? (My day gear is level 2) Also: if I start using a compression vest, will that make my arm/hand LE worse? I am grateful for any help/advice you could give. Thanks and have a better today than yesterday :)",

I'm finally going to get a chest compression garment (Lymed long bra-type thingy, that's what the hospital wants to try first), so hopefully if that decreases the scar area edema, the pain there will lessen. The hospital FT also measured both my arms, was not impressed that my affected right arm was only fractionally larger than the earlier measurement --- but I told her I had been wrapping for three days! (She's only \"heard of\" wrapping...) My private LE therapist will be attneding an LE conference soon, said all the company reps for Caresia and similar products will be there, and she wants to check them all out with me in mind. She agreed with you women that somehing easier to apply than Superlon foam rolls etcwould probably make my life easier. Some women here have PM'd me with links to self-massage technique vidoes on YouTube, and I've started to do them regularly, because it feels good. My LE therapist was sceptical, afraid I'd do it wrong --- but while she was massaging me, I paid attention to the surprisingly light pressure she uses, and now don't think self-massage will hurt. She taught me a \"lighter\" wrap using Ideal stretchier outer bandages and foam layer only on my hand, but I only wore it for about three hours then removed it because it felt bad up my arm. Then I was \"naughty\" -- or practical -- didn't wrap at all for evening or night, so much to do before chemo tomorrow --- and my affectd arm and hand fell off the pillows last night, so of course my hand especially is a bit worse this morning (Weds) but luckily still usable. Just finished a self-massage, am going to wolf down breakfast and wrap :) The hospital gave me the next larger Lymed fingered glove size to put on during chemo but remove if it starts to feel too tight. Fit fine yesterday, a bit too tight in fingers this morning --- but I am finally learning that this LE is a \"living thing\", not static like a broken bone. Everybody is saying chemo itself makes it worse; LE therapist wants me not to stress, would be ok even if I did only elevation infusion/steroids day and the next week or so while my brain is fried, that chemo/steroid fluid is different and temporary, most people only start treatment after all chemo is through. Anyway, thanks to all the support and info from you wonderful women, and my LE therapist, I no longer feel panicky. LE will need constant work to control, but I'm not going to let it be the end of my world.

My hands are not like that, but yes theweb between thumb and 2. is higher than the rest and gets irritated with the Lymed gloves. I was surprised to read in my chemo group here that one woman who developed arm and hand LE is getting the intense decompression therapy (round the clock wraps for a week or so) then glove/sleeve fitting now, in the middle of getting her chemo infusions. Both LE therapists I've seen here say that has to wait until after infusions are over; just wrap \"loosely\" \"some\" for now. My skin has healed enough I am back to wrapping, 4 hrs yesterday evening (to make sure skin could stand it). Wrapped today for 11 hrs using foam roll altered to leave room at the base of my thumb on the finger side, and folding the SS bandages like the new LET did in the pics above. Managed to avoid the too-tight pain at the thumb base. My arm, other fingers, and back of hand cleared fairly well, but thumb actually got worse (I measured). After unwrapping, tried using the IMO too tight Jobst gauntlet from the hospital, thinking it would maybe decompress the thumb, but looks like it made everything worse. Oh well. Trial and error. LE always comes back if I am unwrapped. I am still afraid to sleep wrapped, and I still don't have a usable glove, so I can't wear the sleeve I have. I AM getting measured for a custom version of thr Jobst glove Monday; will also ask should I get a lighter (class 1) sleeve, as that's what the glove will be, my OTC Jobst sleeve is Class 2. So ---- is this back-and-forth compression/LE from no compression doing harm? It does significantly decrease the pain to where I don't need pain meds to sleep, that's motivating me. But having all the swelling come back is depressing. My poor thumb after wrapping (actually all the time now, as I don't know how to decompress it): ",

Also, I guess I'm learning that LE treatment ends up being mostly do-it-yourself trial-and-error anyway...Like now. I just had chemo last Thursday, and still have a massive dose of dexamethasone tomorrow (which causes water retention over 3kg for me), and was advised not to use any kind of compression until that water weight is off, so several more days.

Oncologist said that this \"brain fog\", which is worse the week after a dose but clears partially but not completely weeks 2-3 of chemo cycle, comes from the Taxotere, and should finally ease over several months after my last dose. Hope so. This LE therapist showed me Vodder Wrapping, which freaked me out, as I had never even heard of anything like that, had only the previous week learned about compression sleeves/gloves. She said she needed oncology's permission to start therapy during chemo (infection risk?) otherwise would start in the spring after chemo was done (I assume the Herceptin-only year doesn't count as \"chemo?). Unfortunately I got a skin break on my hand the next day on the web between the thumb and first finger, which has been slowly healing, so I haven't tried the wrapping yet. Woke at 3:30AM, and this time couldn't fall asleep again, so I've been reading and especially watching YouTube videos about LE wrapping (Thank you, GmaFoley for the above link!!!) When the LE therapost wrapped my hand and arm, it felt like I was in a cast, couldn't move anything. Since LE is in my dominant right side, and I have chronic pain/nerve injury issues in my left arm/hand, that was extremely limiting and a bit scary. However, the YouTube videos say/show that you are supposed to wrap so you CAN make a fist and USE you arm/hand --- motion is part of the therapy! --- so I am not so scared of wrapping now. It's 6:45 AM now, plan to finally watch the official Vodder Method DVD after breakfast, and yes I want to try to wrap my hand and arm. Thank you ladies a thousand times for all your support!!! ",

The gauze emptied my fingers and most of my thumb nicely, but the very base of the thumb was still swollen (but no longer sore). Also, maybe because there was only a single layer of the very thin cotton batting, the back of the hand didn't really empty. There were skin \"wrinkles\" all over my forearm, so I think some LE left from there. I like the new way for plcing the SS-bandage wrap around the thumb area (folding so they don't cut into the thumb web) but am not sire what to do to empty the thumb base without cutting off lymphatic drainage (like the first way to wrap does). Am thinking I should try my foam (altered like Binney showed me) plus this new SS style and see what happens. After removing the wrap, I put on my Class 2 Jobst sleeve plus a loaner Class 1 Jobst knit glove for about an hour, but had to remove because the fingertips of the glove were way too tight, fingertips turned white and dark red and hurt :( The hand part of that glove if anything felt a bit loose/not tight at all. Wore no compression to bed. This morning my hand and fingers feel more swollen than they were yesterday before treatment, after three days of basically just elevating the hand/arm over shoulder level as much as humanly possible. I have heard of \"rebound\" and of being \"compression senstive\" and am now a bit comfused about how to proceed... On his way to work this morning, my husband is returning the glove with a message asking the LE FT to phone me. I want to order a custom glove, not sure whether to also order a compression class 1 sleeve (mine is class 2) as the glove is Class 1, or a class 2 glove? Anyway, thank you eveybody for all your encouragement --- especially support for experimenting on my own to try to get things right. I have always found it difficult to just sit back and let somebody treat me with the \"Trust me!\" attitude and no explanations of Why. Guess I am a monster of a control freak ;)",

My LE had just been diagnosed a few days before my last dose, when my hand was not yet involved (nno pain or swelling), and didnn't worsen IMO. However my LE has steadily worsened, and last Saturday after not wrapping or using sleeve/glove for three days (skin break btwn thumb/fingerr from bad-fitting glove), I woke up unable to use my right hand for 5 hours, the swelling was so tight I couldn't make even a hallf-fist or grasp anything. I am afraid of that happening again then NOT EVER resolving (permanent tissue damage) if I don't use anything during the steroids (even the LE therapist suggested that, just do elevation, wrap again once steroid swelling goes down). I can't wrap during the chemo infusion and still use cold glove to protect against further neuropathy from the Taxotere. The sleeve/new gauntlet glove are now very tight and make more hand swelling not less after wrapping. The very informative StandUpSpeakOut site does not clearly address this I'm scared.",

LE therapist suggeste sticking with the lighter Class 1 compression for the glove, since I am still actively getting chemo through the middle of January; I am considering ordering a Class 1 sleeve also (the Jobst I have is Class 2) because in addition to my hand, the LE in my upper arm is painful.
