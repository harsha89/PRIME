I've have numbness and pain on my fingers basically since I started taxol, my toes are also numb, my mo, surgeon and mr have all told me that it will go away, well almost 3 months since I finished chemo and no progress yet, some days are worse than others, my nails are lifted and have to be extra careful not to hurt them. I really don't know if there is any medication to help with the symptoms, I've just been dealing with them a day at a time. Hope you get some answers on your appt. take care",
