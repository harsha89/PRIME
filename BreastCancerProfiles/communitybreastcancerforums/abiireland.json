I'd really like some outside opinions here as I feel like I'm sending myself crazy... background story...  I'm 22 and very active and try to keep healthy. A couple of months (3/4) ago my left nipple became very dry and flaky... happened a few times but I pit it down to just dry skin as I  prone to eczema.  This stopped happening after a while but then I developed a very itchy rash... felt like it was itchy from the inside. Put that down to eczema too. Then I noticed a small red dot (Kind of like a skin tag) appear about a month ago, took no notice.  None of these things worried me up until now beccause about two weeks ago my left breast became very very swollen and extremely sore out of nowhere. So sore I couldn't wear a bra and felt very heavy and almost solid... couldn't feel any lumps though. Went to doctor who has now put me on a course of antibiotics and anti inflammatorys for 10 days. The swelling has gone down a little and I can now feel a small hard lump just under my nipple. (Oh also doctor notice swollen gland in left armpit).  So swelling has reduced but today a small ree mark appeared on my breast and I'm terrified. 10 days seems like a very long time to wait to go back for a check up...  Is it possible to hhave IBC without the orange peel skin and redness? If anyone has any insight I'd really appreciate it as I am scared as hell!  Thanks so much xxx Log in to post a reply",
