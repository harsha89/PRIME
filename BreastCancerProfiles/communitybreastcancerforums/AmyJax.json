I'm really tired at the end of day 2, afraid of what tomorrow will bring. Unknown since this was my first...... For anyone interested, I did find a neat site on the web for applying makeup to faces that have lost hair from alopecia (chemo induced or otherwise). The eyebrow tutorial was really cool.

And like someone else mentioned, even before it all happened, sex might have been something I began to mentally schedule....I plan on working on that more when I get through this, but some how I've totally set it aside for now. We hold hands and share caring touches but only just recently have I begun to think about engaging in some type of sex. Seriously, my foobs are not attractive naked, my chest aches constantly from the expanders, all that skin is completely numb, I'm definitely limited in comfortable horizontal positions.....BUT part of me just wants to do something nice and truly loving for DH because he's been so supportive and kind, and even though I know intellectually that cancer is nobody's fault, I feel guilty that he's had to go through this. This isn't what any spouse signs up for...... Maybe sex is just another thing we have to \"keep the faith\" on throughout this journey.",

I had my port put in today and it is so sore......I mean not like Tylenol sore, like percoset sore. How long is it going to feel this way...anyone? I was down to a half a percoset to sleep to tap down that dull tissue expander pain to sleep at night.....and hoping to move away from it all together next week. (I'd love to drive again sometime soon!) Thoughts? Anyone have any other pain tips?",

My chemo is delayed, I have a stubborn drain still putting out too much fluid, my expansion was larger and more painful, I was supposed to go get the port put in for the chemo I wasn't sure I was going to start, I still wasn't completely sure which chemo to do, and I've arrived at the realization that I'm going to have pain that I'm going to learn to live with for an undetermined amount of time.....it's all just incredibly overwhelming. Beyond overwhelming. I proactively pushed my chemo and port knowing that this drain is still so active. That simple act of control made me feel a bit better. I also found some meditation podcasts and downloaded them. I've never meditated before but I was searching for something to help. I'm secretly hoping I can meditate my drain site to heal.....(worth a try). They HAVE helped to relieve some of my emotion and stress. You can get them on iTunes for free or from the Website: Meditation Oasis by Mary and Richard Maddux. I hope today is a better day for you InDenial - and everyone who is feeling low. It's finally sunny where I am....first sun in four days. I'm going to go for a walk. Peace to all pink sisters.",
