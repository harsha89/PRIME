Doctor said she can tell it is cancer from the way the 1 cm mass looks. I'm confused, terrified. She told me to expect a lumpectomy and radiation treatment. Has anyone else here been told they have cancer before even a biopsy is done? Feel very alone...I know no one who has breast cancer. I am 51 with grown children and my first grandchild was just born 10 weeks ago... Grateful that I found this forum.

I definitely do not feel alone in this battle anymore and am so happy that I stumbled across this website! The biopsy was not nearly as bad as I had thought. Having a huge needle stuck in my breast was a scary thought but the anesthesia worked well and other than popping Tylenol every 4 hours or so, I really was fine. So...now comes the really hard part - waiting for the results. My husband and I meet with the doctor tomorrow (Thursday) at 2:40 pm. We know it's cancer, she was quite positive of that. Just waiting to hear the stage and if the lymph nodes are involved. I will be assigned a nurse navigator who will help me through the process. I have a lot of questions and really not sure where to post them. I might need to ask the moderators about this. Questions about the lumpectomy (if that's what I need and not a mastectomy - hopefully will know that tomorrow), radiation treatments (does it hurt, how long does it take at every treatment, can I wear my regular deodorant and use my regular lotions, etc.). I am sure that the nurse navigator can answer questions as well, but it's just nice to hear from other women who are going through the same thing, with personal advice. Where can I find stories of inspiration? I need to hear about success in this breast cancer fight! :) I don't know you wonderful women but I already feel as though you are my friends. I don't understand the terminology that you use yet when talking about this, but I will learn it quickly enough. Once again, thank you for your input! I am so appreciative!!",

My breast cancer surgeon appt is tomorrow. What does this mean? Will I need chemo and mastectomy? They were so sure I would not be positive on all three and I am.... Is there a specific place on these threads to talk about this when you are positive on all three? Is this what is called triple positive cancer? Can anyone tell me good news about this? I feel I am desperately seeking hope when there is none....

Positive for breast cancer, 8 mm mass in left breast, invasive, does not look like it has gone to the lymph nodes but further testing will be done at time of lumpectomy. Still waiting on further tests from the biopsy, but they will not be available until Monday. He said because of the tumor size being small, he felt confident that I had a 98 - 99% five-year survival chance. Overwhelmed but feeling okay. Has anyone else had a similar-sized mass that was invasive and it all turned out okay? I need some positivity.....
