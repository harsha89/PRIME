My surgeon said either a MX with immadate recon. or a lumpsectomy? Then you have to worry about a reaccurance in the other breast?? is it better to get BMX?? Then why do they call it immadiate when it's not?? lolol I thought for 3 months u get the BMX or MX and they put the implant in right then.. NO it more to it... But LIKE YOU SAID YOU NEVER KNWO HOW STRONG YOU ARE UNTIL YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG!!!!  YOU RIGHT SO many BLOODY decisions. HUGS TO YOU...",

It's not like I didn't know I would have to get some kind of surgey but now that it's offical for a MX it's like new again.. markat I know I will not be able to go to stright to implants, because I am not a tiny tot. I feel myself feeling better by the minute.. I just want to feel normal and happy.. Yes everybody said i went through the hard part already with chemo?? I sure hope that is true. Because Chemo wasn't that bad for me. So to my understanding after the surgey it's takes months to be normal again?? with to have the exchange? also if you have TE how do you wear foobie's?",

Is there anyway you can call your doctor and tell her your really nervous and that you would like to get a earlier appointment? She should be able to call them and have it stat. The 17th is a longtime away you will drive yourself insane.I will keep you in my prayers but you at the right place for comforting words....   Ipost3698 Your doctor just want to make sure, she can't really say what it is with a touch and feel. yes you have lumps but they could just be all be B-9. that is what we are going to wish for. what time is your appoinrment tomorrow???  There is power in prayer. I will be praying for you tonight ",

I was 34 at the time I was diagnosed and all i could do in the dr. office was scream. I couldn't even cry because I was super in shock and after speaking with my dr. I knew everything was going to be alright. You have to have faith and trust.. I did chemo first to, and if your heathly and in good shape and have a strong mind you will be okay. I never got sick, I still worked and lived my life like I always have.. The downside of it all was losing my hair. But I cut my hair off before if could fall out. I stared wearing wig and changed them up often you have plkay with your new new self and love yourself from the inside out.. The people you share your BC with someone will come at you with some stupid response about chemo or anything you have the right to curse them out and leave them alone until after your comfortable talking.. The days you feel tired just relax listen to you body.. Believe me you will be fine...xoxoxoxoxo many hugs to you.... This is a lifestyle change for teh better u and new u..  ",

I been doing great for 5 years on tamoxphin now it's nor working and I have small spot on my breast bone. My doctor recommended me starting on ibance, fastlodex, Zoldex and the X-geva shot. I am so nervous because I don't know what to expect. I am fairly healthy not on any other medications. The Ibrance is suppose to come tomorrow morning so I guess I will take a pill with my dinner. I can't seem to sleep at night because all I can think about is this new medicine. I had zero side effects of the tamoxphin or Chemo other than the losing hair. Can someone please help a sister out and ease my mind. what I am grateful for that it's something we can take. I know everyone is different I am just praying that I can just continue to live a normal fun life while I can. I have an 8 years old and we are very active I would hate for that to stop. Thank You and I am praying everyday for us all.",
