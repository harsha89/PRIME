So surprised to have worse pain 6 months after lumpectomy-- they really don't tell you-- you have to seek out help. After radiation ending in April, looks like I may be sun intolerant. Trying steroid and Cere Ve cream for 2 weeks per dermatologist before a biopsy just to be sure but pink rash around breast and across clavicle area, itches, and sore scar, tender breast and additional swelling. Reminds me of a breast infection when nursing babies. So relieved to learnothers have had this!",
