This was the best advice given because there is no way they could have anticipated how much time was needed for each patient to get bedside help, to mearly adjust the pillow, get a drink, use the restroom or mearly raise up. These nurses would have to be miracle worker octopus to fullfill this imposible task of help you ladies need and deserve.  All the pillows you can bring is my suggestion and any extra bodies to help just mearly to give you a spoonful of food or ice chips.  Anything you do to help anticipate pain prevention doit get it.  You might try a sling pouch or waist pouch along with a mesh shower pouch to help yourselves protect your drainage tubes from hurting you so terrible and you will help able yourself and help able a nurse to be able to help the next patients need too. So I guess this is a way to pay forward help free up time for the next and the next, what else can I say all of you need attention help each other, Love & God Bless You take care of you and maybe these pouches will help. www.helppersons.com",
