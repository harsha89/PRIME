Nothing in my life has ever given me such a visceral feeling as that document did.  You have a rough road ahead, but not as rough as you may imagine. I felt a whole lot better once a plan was in place and I got on the treatment path. Surround yourself with friends and family and try to take good care of yourself. I wouldn't want to relive those initial days ever again, but I can say that my life right now, while in treatment, is manageable and a WHOLE lot less scary.  We are here for you!

I had my first cytoxan treatment almost two weeks ago along with adriamycian. I did not take any anti-nausea meds ahead. When I arrived at infusion, I was given a steroid, then a drip of Emend and another of Aloxi. I had the adriamycian which is pushed over about 15 minutes then the cytoxan was an hour. I was given compazine, steroid, and Ativan for at home. I needed to take the Ativan that night (anti-nausea and anti-anxiety properties work well). The next day I started taking compazine and continued for 2 more days (total of 4). I felt very mild nausea and was just tired out. It wasn't as bad as I expected at all. And that said, I'm not sure which drug would cause which side effects specifically, so you may do well with just the C portion. do you need to get Neulasta? That was easy for me too. I had no bone pain, but did take Claritin just in case. Best wishes! It's difficult enough to have cancer, let alone other medical conditions to manage along with it.

I definitely see people looking at me thinking, \"Wow, that sure is short :)\" but that's their problem, not mine - LOL. Thank you so much for the compliments. It's been a journey, as we all know! It's nice to be back to normal decisions like, \"What color will I dye my hair?\" instead of, \"Do I need to take an Immodium soon?\" Haha!  ",

It looks very natural in my opinion. Then I blend with a brow brush to take out any \"edges\". It is expensive but I think it will last a long time since I use so little. I also have a brown liner/pen thing but that tends to not be necessary since the powder does a good job. I still have a few brow hairs hanging on. ",

I did loose sense of taste and then sometimes heightened sense of taste. Sometimes sensitive to smells. Constipated due to the nausea meds (Emend, Aloxi, Compazine, Ativan and steroid). I worked through it but took 1/2 days on day 2 and 3 then had the weekend to regroup. I felt nauseous but not outrageously so. I never felt as if I would vomit. I drank a lot for the first couple days. Close to a gallon each day. Usually was feeling back to myself days 7 onward. Neulasta was a non event. I took Claritin to fight the bone pain which wasn't significant. I did get hand / foot near the end (just my hands got sore and a brownish red) and I'm told it will go away. I sure hope so! Lost all hair that had started to grow back after taxol. Overall not as bad as I expected but certainly wouldn't want to go back and do it again. Good luck! Linda",
