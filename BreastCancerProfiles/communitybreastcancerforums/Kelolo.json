I saw the oncologist on Friday and he told me I was triple negative.  Just one more bit of news that I didn't want to hear.  I noticed there is also a forum here for triple negative so I will have to check it out. I'm not sure if my chemo will be started by the end of the month or not.  I am supposed to go back to Oklahoma City this week to do a PET scan and have a port installed. I plan to ask him about a sleep aid when I see him again.  In all the tension of the first visit, I completely forgot.  I knew I should have followed the advice of 'writing down all my questions'. I'm glad I found a forum where I can talk to those who can truly relate to what I'm going thru.  Onward I go, taking it one day at a time. ",

I just wanted the thing OUT!! The last path indicated grade III, poorly differentiated, with three nodes positive. Now I am second-guessing myself and wondering if I should have had a mastectomy due to the level of aggressiveness. Up to this point I have been scared to ask my doctors any questions. Instead I just ask for a copy of the paperwork and read and research to come to my own conclusions. I am finding that this is just making the situation worse for me. I will be seeing an oncologist on the 14th of September. I am absolutely terrified. Nights are the worst for me because thoughts start spinning wildly through my head when it gets quiet. I've read technical jargon online to the point of diminishing marginal returns. Now I would just love to get some input from those who have experienced this firsthand. Thanks in advance to you all...

Karyll, I hope you are still doing well.  The worst side effect I have had so far was some facial flushing on Wednesday, the day after my treatment.  It was rather uncomfortable, but not painful, and gone by the next day.  I did have some stool problems but seem to have worked them out with raisin bran for breakfast two days in a row.  The fatigue hit me Wednesday evening and I was out like a light until Thursday evening.  I also had a couple of mild bouts of nausea, but I'm pretty sure it was from letting my stomach go empty.  Friday I actually got up and showered and got out of the house for a while.  Today has almost been normal for me except I have no appetite.  Karen, I got my Neulasta shot on Wednesday at about five pm.  I had read somewhere on the forum that they recommend having the shot in your abdomen.  That's what I did and I haven't had any problems with bone pain.  But then again I don't know how many days after the shot it would take for the effects to kick in.  I'm also on TAC but the order they give it to me is CAT.   I'm not sure why they haven't changed their approach since they found the liver mets.  I will ask my onc at my next treatment. Hugs to all!  We will prevail! Kenna",

I did have a reaction to the Taxotere.  My face started burning, turned beet red, and my throat felt like it was closing up.  I went into complete panic mode and the nurses came over and shut the Taxotere drip down, put oxygen on me, and started monitoring my vitals.  The reaction passed almost as quickly as it had started. After that I received another drip of the benadryl/tagamet mix that they had given me before they started the chemicals.  They started up the Taxotere again and began very slowly.  I was fine from then on.  Apparently reactions to some of the drugs are common, but Taxotere isn't one of them. I didn't mark the exact time the treatments started, but I think it was about 3 1/2 hours.  That was including the time it took to give me the extra drip after my reaction.  I was worried that the port site would be sore since I just had it placed on Friday.  They numbed it with a spray beforehand and the needle went in just fine.  Today I will get my Neulesta injection.  I was told that it would probably make me achy like the flu.  I did find out today that I have two spots on my liver.  I had only gotten my CT scan and bone scan on Thursday, but he did a follow up ultrasound of my liver on Monday.  I will receive another ultrasound some time after my second treatment to see how the spots are responding.  Metastases had never entered my mind.  I am numbed by the stats on it and still in shock, but trying to keep my chin up.  Hugs to all, Kenna",

Urbie, my onc's office is an hour drive from here and they set me up with a local hospital to give me my Neulasta the next day to save me a drive.  The first hospital they called refused to give me the shot because they said it was too much of a risk because my insurance might not reimbuse them!  Fortunately they called a hospital in another nearby community that gave me my shot.  I mean, here we are sick and they want to squabble about insurance!  Well, yesterday and today I've started to feel the effects on my digestive tract.  I'm sooooo thankful for the anti-nausea meds they have prescribed for me.  I also have a small sore on the roof of my mouth and my tongue is tingling.  I'm fighting hard with the rinses to keep it from getting any worse.  No black tongue---yet.  Anna, how long did they give you between round one of the chemo and round two?   Hugs to all!  We will prevail!

My first visit to the onc was September 14.  I was very pleased with him.  He was very upbeat and very thorough.  He ordered my scans and some labwork and I left his office feeling positive.  On Monday when I was having my final test, the heart scan, his office called over and ordered an ultrasound of the liver.  I had my CT and bone scans done last Thursday so I was in immediate panic mode.  I watched during the ultrasound as the techs found the tumor and marked and measured it.  Of course they couldn't tell me anything, but I had seen all I needed to know.  I had my first chemo treatment scheduled for yesterday.  My onc didn't have the results of the ultrasound when he first saw me, but his demeanor was so much different than from my first office visit with him.  When he told me the results after my chemo treatment, I could see it in his face and his eyes.  I hope he hasn't given up already. That scares me. Today I am having some mild efffects from the chemo--a little nausea which the meds are keeping in check, and my face looks sunburned.  I go later for my Neulasta injection. I hate what has brought us all here, but I can't find the words to express how much it means to have found all of you!  But I'm sure you all know what I am trying to say! Hugs to all! Kenna",
