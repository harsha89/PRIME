I'm going back to MD Anderson Sept 12 to see a new PS & hopefully get referred to a *real* pain management doctor if necessary.   I've had a lot of crazy stuff happen in the 2 years since I was diagnosed (20 wks pregnant at dx, \"lumpectomy\"/biopsy done w/o anesthesia, FAC x4 while pregnant, normal delivery, Taxol x2, Taxotere x1 (neuropathy w/ Taxol then allergic rx to Taxotere), BM w/ expander recon, PBSO with over 2 units blood necessary since I almost bled to death, emergency Hyst from abscess that formed after PBSO one month later, and exchange surgery. I have 800cc implants to replace my DD/DDD natural breasts. Oh, & all this was before my 30th birthday. I have a soon-to-be 2 year old daughter (my chemo baby), a soon-to-be 4 year old son, a husband of soon-to-be 5 years, a full-time high-stress job (the only $$ our family can live on), and commute 70 miles a day 5 days a week. Its been 6 months since my exchange surgery & by the end of the day I can hardly stand the pain in my chest, neck, collar-bones, & arms. Sometimes its sharp & stabbing, but othertimes its achy and 'tight'. Its almost always non-specific (ie my whole chest hurts, not just one spot). I feel like I hit my \"funny-bone\" only it extends up to my shoulder & neck as well as into my hands sometimes. I'm allergic to Lyrica/Neurontin (I tried it for chemo-neuropathy) & the narcotics just don't seem to be doing anything. The best relief I get is from a muscle relaxer and/or the Voltaren gel that I just recently started using. I've tried some theraputic massage -- I was so sore I could hardly move for a couple days afterwards. I'm in the midst of chiropractic care to help my spine cope with compensating for my painful front. I'm in the midst of pain management (non-oncological) that started with a referral for trigger point injections that didn't work & has developed into a narcotics prescription. The PS that did my exchange has basically washed her hands of me b/c she's never seen any one have issues like this. The same for a better class PS (more experience w/ reconstruction than my local PS, but still small-town, Louisville, KY). The option these 2 PSs have given me are 1) live with it, 2) operate & put in smaller implants -- might or might not work they can't predict, 3) operate & NOT put implants in at all -- might or might not work they can't predict. I chose option 4) GO somewhere where they do reconstructions on a daily basis! I have to say that at this point I don't have a whole lot of hope which completely depresses me. I was on a couple different anti-depressants to deal w/ my mondo hot-flashes (hello surgical menopause), but they didn't seem to help me at all (I was on each of them for well over the minimum time required to notice a difference).",
