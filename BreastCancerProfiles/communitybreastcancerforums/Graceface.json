Looks good 1 month later, I have been using Mederma, don't use Vitamin E,clinical study from U of Miami. I was in the operating room for about 45 minutes and in Recovery Room for 2 hours.  No pain, they gave me a RX for darvocet and I never got it filled.  I used Tylenol extra strength for about a day.  You can go back to work if you have to, I didn't.  I had to wear a bra for 24 hours and use ice off and on for one night.  No lifting of anything over 10 lbs for 10 days. Good Luck!     ",

I did not have a lump removed,I had tissue removed. My wire insertion was not as easy as they said it was going to be.  The tissue marker, which was inserted during a stereotactic bx migrated.....more than the average.  The wire that they insert is like a piece of picture wire, except thinner.  They numb your breast with lidocaine, feels like a bee sting, prior to the insertion.  My wire insertion was in radiology dept, prior to the excisional bx.  The wire insertion was awkward, after the wire is in, they taped it down and walked me back to OR holding area.  It wasn't painful, just mild discomfort.They also do a couple of mammograms to make sure the wire is in the right place.  The wire marks the spot where the surgeon will cut.  I'm sure you will be in good hands tomorrow!  God Bless!",

I was inpatient at first but was reassured this type of dx is usually seen in 3- 4 months.  Surgeon mentioned Tamoxifen to me as well. If I am a candidate,I would decline, based on data, the benefits do not outweigh the risks for me.  I'm just being patient until my appt in Oct. Good Luck to you.",

      "Content": "Graceface wrote: I recently had a stereotactic biopsy and a small titanium tissue marker was placed in my breast to identify the calcification area. Next, I had an excisional biopsy done with wire guided placement.  After the excisional bisopsy, the surgeon notified me that the tissue marker was not removed with the tissue that she had removed, confirmed upon x-ray. Apparently the tissue marker migrated so far that it was no where to be found. Is this common, to have this tissue marker just sitting in your breast, probably for the rest of your life?  I was informed that it's no big deal. Any harm? Log in to post a reply",
