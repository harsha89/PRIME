    "Content": "Oct 25, 2013 07:09AM - edited Oct 25, 2013 07:11AM by Tipps04 Audra67 - I was recently faced with same decision when I discovered my Oncologist sent my tumor samples out for Onco test. I had 2 small tumors, .5 and .7, one DCIS and one invasive. My Onco test score came back at 19. I was so hopeful it was going to be lower - was only willing to accept 10 or lower. It was an extremely difficult decision. I decided to have the chemo and was also scared to death. I was prescribed TC * 4 as well. I had my first treatment last Wed 10/16. From the following Sat night until this past Wed, I will have to admit I felt like the walking dead. I believe I had a quite severe reaction to the Neulasta (white blood cell count booster) shot that is given the day after treatment. I had severe flu like symptoms and horrific bone pain. With that said, I have had 2 good days of being able to function and feel somewhat normal - still not myself, but WAY better than a few days ago. I want to be completely honest because I would rather know than not. I had not expected the first go around to hit me the way it did - again I think it was Neulasta. I am having a check up with my doctor today to see if we can eliminate the Neulasta or at least reduce dosage for the next treatment. Yes, I said next treatment! Four days ago I was ready to throw in the towel and quit - I am NOT a quitter so this was so hard for me to feel like giving up. Today, I am mentally preparing for my next treatment which is in about 2 weeks. I have done so much research showing that this course of treatment provides such great results in preventing recurrence, that I cannot give up. The benefits of the treatment outway the side effects which are temporary. Now in a few weeks, I may be singing a different tune, but now I know that for potentially a week after treatment I may be totally out of it, I can handle it. It is all about knowing what to expect for me. Also, everyone reacts differently, so your experience, should you move forward, may be completely different. I can share more of what I went through should you decide to move forward, so you can have informed discussions with your doctor about avoiding some things. For example, I refused the Ativan which is primary prescribed for nauseu, which thankfully I did not experience, but can also counter act steroids you need to take around day of treatment and can also battle anxiety. I will be asking for a prescription for Ativan today to help me sleep - my mind is working overtime these days. Good luck with your decision!!",
