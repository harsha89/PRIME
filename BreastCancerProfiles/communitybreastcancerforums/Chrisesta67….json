      "Content": "Chrisesta67 wrote: I was diagnosed with DCIS and IDC inright breast last March. I'm now almost 4 weeks out from a simple mastectomy and very frustrated with the treatment recommendations from here. Due to a very small cancer growth found in the sentinel lymph node, my medical team is recommending 4 infusions of TC chemotherapy, radiation, and 5 years of Tamoxifen. The sentinel lymph node was removed during surgery and so the doctors don't really know whether any cancer even exists in the other lymph nodes. The hour+ long trips to the hospital are exhausting for me and my 74-year old mother who insists on driving me; my doctors haven't clearly staged my cancer (possibly stage 1B); my professional colleagues are becoming frustrated with the time I spend out of the office at medical appointments; pre-chemo informational appointments are overwhelming (the chemo itself hasn't even begun); the stress of chemo and radiation is interfering with my recovery from the surgery. I'm tired and scared. Part of me just wants to take my chances with the Tamoxifen alone. I don't have my family's BRCA1 gene mutation. Even my aunt, who has the gene mutation, did not have a recurrence of her breast cancer for more than 27 years. I can't help but think that maybe it's possible to have too much treatment; why introduce toxins into my body or burn my skin when all of the right side breast tissue is gone and the size of the tumor in the removed lymph node is only one cm (possibly smaller)? Exhausted, confused, and considering the wisdom of making my own decisions about my own body. ~ Christine Log in to post a reply",

After my first couple of treatments, my collarbone area was redder than I expected it to be so soon into the treatment plan. I was pretty nervous about what would follow. I've now had 20 treatments (out of 33, total). I am quite red across the whole radiation field (from my collarbone down to a couple of inches below my mastectomy scar) but it's not the same as a sunburn. It truly doesn't hurt as I think a sunburn would. To counteract the dryness of the radiated skin, I'm using a cream called Miaderm, which I found online. It's a bit pricey but it has very good reviews from radiation oncology patients. It has a somewhat thin consistency that spreads easily over sensitive skin, feels cool on my skin when first applied, and absorbs well. It's true that my red skin itches a bit, especially in the collarbone area where the skin is stretched thinner across bone. But, it really isn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. I try to do stretching exercises for a few minutes everyday to keep the mastectomy side as flexible as possible through this process. I'm more than halfway through my radiation treatments, yet the exercises don't hurt any more than they did prior to beginning radiation. I'm definitely an anxious person but, so far, my fears about the physical effects of radiation have been unfounded. Also, my radiation oncologist has told me that the appearance of a skin reaction is one indicator that the radiation is having the desired adverse effect on the cancer cells that may be present in the treatment field. I know everyone is different and reactions to any medical treatment are unique to the individual. Still, maybe my experience of early redness but, in general, very manageable physical side-effects can offer some encouragement to you. I think one of the most important things to remember during radiation or any treatment process is to be candid with your treatment team about how you are feeling each step of the way and what your concerns and questions are. Best wishes to you as you move forward in your treatment journey.",

I'm in the challenging position of needing to change jobs very soon and being about to begin radiation therapy. I need to include the New England (U.S.) region in my job search. For financial and professional reasons, I'm not really in a position to turn down the right job if it's offered (even if it's in a different state from where I'm currently living). But I'm also committed to 33 sessions of radiation oncology, scheduled to begin within the next week or so. I'm going to pose this question to my radiation oncologist but I'm also curious about what members of this breast cancer support community might know about making a treatment center change during the radiation process. I value this support group and will appreciate any responses. Log in to post a reply",

Thanks also for the information about the Canadian fraction. I'll inquire about that, too.",

The skin on my right side mastectomy site (no reconstruction) is still tight and painful more than 4 months after surgery. I'm afraid 33 sessions of radiation will destroy my skin and tissues altogether and I'll never again be able to feel or move normally in that area. Why are doctors torturing me as a result of a micrometastasis in my sentinel lymph node? How could the skin-destroying nature of radiation possibly be indicated after 12 weeks of TC chemotherapy for a microscopic cancer that may not even still exist in my body? I'm at the end of my rope with respect to what I think is my \"over treatment\" for very small, very early stage breast cancer. I was tattooed today for radiation but I'm coming closer and closer to saying no to the radiation sessions altogether. I must say that I'm astounded by the lack of healthcare provider sensitivity and understanding that a cancer patient may have some serious concerns about consenting to have her already compromised mastectomy site skin burned to the extent that it may not recover for years, if at all. If anyone has words of wisdom based on experience, I'm more than willing to read and consider them here. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I finished radiation (33 treatments) at the end of October (so it's been a little more than a week since my last treatment). The radiation field was my right side, a square section around the mastectomy area and under the right arm. Two or three days after my last treatment, I noticed itchy bumps beginning to form on my chest and upper abdomen. The bumpy rash has spread to include most of the skin in an approx. 2-inch area around the radiation field, the center front of my neck, and on the upper part of my left breast. Much of the actual radiation field, though, is not affected. I'm mystified. The rash is periodically itchy but not painful. So, I don't think it's shingles. The little bumps don't seem to be filled with fluid (not pustules). Just hundreds of little clustered bumps in certain areas of my chest and torso. There's redness, too; but, the redness seems mainly associated with my scratching. I've spoken with one of my radiation oncology nurses over the phone; she doesn't think the rash relates to the radiation at all. I've also spoken via phone with my medical oncology NP (who's wonderful, by the way). She's going to try to get me a dermatology appointment for this Wednesday, the same day that I'm already scheduled for a post-chemo follow-up with my medical oncologist (I finished chemo last July). It's just so peculiar that this rash has developed so soon after radiation and that it's located on the periphery of the general radiation area. I haven't been using any new soaps, lotions, or detergents. I'm just so mystified. While I wait to see a doctor, I'm wondering if anyone in this community has experienced anything like this during or soon after radiation. Just curious.... Log in to post a reply",

She couldn't really pinpoint the cause.... but said that my skin, which is I know is a bit sensitive to begin with, is probably reacting in general to the chemo, radiation, and the psychological stress beought on by those physical procedures. She prescribed a steroid cream, whixh I'll apply twice a day for two weeks. She said it didn't seem terribly serious and should clear up with the cream.  I hope your RO and dermatologiat will be able to diagnose your skin reaction and you'll be able to clear it up soon. I've been very fortunate to have made connections with a terrific and compassionate healthcare team. Even when there aren't always definitive answers, the consistently thoughtful care I've received has been very reassuring. I wish the same for you.",

A few days ago, I received a diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)... two biopies of my right breast and two diagnoses. I'm pretty much in shock like so many others who have shared their stories on this site. Objectively, though, I'm not completely surprised. Many women on my father's side of the family have been diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. My aunt (father's sister, a breast cancer survivor) tested positive for the BRAC1 mutation 14 years ago, when genectic testing for hereditary breast cancer was in its early stages. Yesterday, I participated in a genetic counseling session and gave blood to be analyzed at the lab in Utah. What amazes me most right now, though, is the speed with which my treatment plan is unfolding. Since my cancer is \"multi-centric,\" my doctor tells me that a mastectomy is necessary. Restructive surgery would follow during the same surgical session, immediately after the mastectomy is performed. At this point, a breast MRI has been scheduled for me along with a plastic surgery consultation, a phone call with the anesthesia team, and an actual surgery date of April 11. Yet, the only conversation I've had with my breast surgeon was the emotionally difficult one during which she told me what the biopies showed. It's not that I doubt the expertise and skil of my doctor. It's just that I feel as though I'm loading up my calendar with life-changing events while I've just barely begun to process my BC diagnosis. Do treatment plans... reconstructive consultations and surgery dates... typically move this quickly?  Also, I'm very curious to find out if I test positive for the BRAC1 mutation. If I do, I'm guessing my healthcare team is going to want to talk about my left breast, which (as far as I know) is cancer free right now. I'm trying to process my situation emotionally, write down my questions for the next time I talk with my doctor, keep tabs on medical insurance requirements, and decide which breast cancer survival memoir I might want to read. Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated. As I read messages on this site, I can see that I'm not alone and that there is comfort in sharing our stories.  Log in to post a reply",
