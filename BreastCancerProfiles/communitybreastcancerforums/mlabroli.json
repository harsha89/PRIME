I have met with 2 breast surgeons, the first at a small community hospital the second at a huge cancer tertiary care center.  I am sticking with the latter- he just seems more informed.  I had a surgical biopsy after I was told \"it was probably nothing\", and since have had a positive sentinel node biopsy.  I am meeting with a plastic surgeon next monday may 16.  I am 99% sure I will do bilateral mastectomy - but am SO scared to think about the possibly of chemo after--how long will that take, will I still be able to work, don't really want to lose my hair, and I have 2 small kids - 6yo and 2 yo.  Also so scared about tamoxifen for 5 years after- if anyone knows what this is like premenopausal please let me know.  I cry too, but mostly I just don't sleep.  You are in my prayers--good luck with the surgeon --",
