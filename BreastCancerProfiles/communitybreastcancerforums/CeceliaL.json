Was diagnosed with breast cancer in both breasts last Tuesday, Grade 3, ER+ and PR+ (still awaiting HER2 results). I've been in and out of hospitals the last week having my MRI and PeT/CT scan done the scans have confirmed 2 tumours in right breast with lymph node action aswell as in the middle of my chest behind the breast bone and one tumour in the left breast. Offcourse I am in shock as I only had my breast scanned 12 months ago. I'm trying to be postive and would really appreciate any stories on similiar cases. I'm finding it so difficult looking at my husband suffer and I just want to hold my 4 year old son and never let him go. Met with my surgen today and he said that we will do a double mastectomy but no reconstruction as they need the best chance for the radiotherapy to work on the  nodes in the chest wall (aparently these can't be surgically removed). I will also have 3 lympnodes removed from under my anrm and breast (he then went on to talking about lymphemia( I turned off at that stage). Sorry I just jumped into this conversation but I suppose I need to start somewhere and I was browsing the discussion boards when I saw Cuetang's post about not sleeping. Any information or words of advice appreciated. Been keeping very positive but seem to have delved into a dark place now.",

I had mine yesterday (double masectomy) and was really out of it for the whole of yesterday, but today have made an effort and started my arm excercises and walking up and down the hospital corridors. Every now and then I seem to delve into a dark place if I think on the matter too much. So I try and keep my mind occupied with other things.  Thanks for the advice Maltomlin, it sounds like good advice.  My next step is to start chemo, herceptin and radiotherapy as I have some cancer in the interal mammory nodes (doc said he can't get to it, but it is HER2 positive) so will start me on hercepton. Does anyone know of someone who has similiar? ",

I'm am off to surgery tomorrow so decided to try and enjoy today and deal with tomorrow when it comes. Hold thumbs and I'll speak to you soon on that matter. I'm very glad to hear that you are in a better place and you are right we should concentrate on the facts not that statistics. ",

I'm at home today and its really nice to be at home. My husband has just been fantastic and helping with everything.  My son's childminder decided to make a huge cardboard with lots of childrens drawings and cut out foam letter that say \"get well soon\", its so lovely and made me smile. His childminder said that one of the children asked him why his mommy was in the hospital and he said \"because her boobies are poorly\"  :-) ",
