I was originally DX with ILC in both breasts in 2011, then it returned in 2014. First to just lymph nodes. I still do not have any spread to a major organ, so for that I am very relieved. But it is in many lymph nodes in chest, pelvis, near colon, and recently in the last two months found a mass behind my eye in the muscle, and now a mass in my thigh. I had to have surgery behind my eye and am recouperating from that. We will have to do a scan in a month to see if that is going away. And now my left leg is swelling because of that mass. We will do either radiation or surgery to remove the mass in my leg based on what we find out. I started on Afinitor. I had a bad lung reaction and had to go off that. Then I did Taxol, and then Faslodex. I originally had the estrogen receptor, but then the Faslodex wasn't working, so they did another biopsy and found that my cancer had mutated and now I am triple negative. So we are moving forward with just chemo, and I am on my 3rd round of Xeloda. This looks like a great place for support. My head is spinning. I will visit the Xeloda threads to see how people are doing on that. I am hopeful. I really think my eye and thigh progression started back in November/December when I was on the Faslodex and it wasn't working. Just a note; I have a 20 year old daughter who had leukemia when she was 6. She is fine and in remission now, but the parent discussion boards on the LLS were a livesaver for me back then, so I am so glad to find another group to belong to. Gay",
