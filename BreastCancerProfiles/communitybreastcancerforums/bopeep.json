      "Content": "bopeep wrote: There is reseach going on at the University of Michigan that is focusing on cancer stem cells, which are believed to fuel the spread of breast cancer. Stem cells are being targeted with experimental drugs at UM in what has been described as\"groundbreaking clinical trials that researchers hope will lead to a breakthrough in treatment for cancer with stem cells.\" \"By using experimental drugs to block these cancer stem cells, doctors hope the tumors will shrink or at least stop spreading and will lead to better ways to treat -- and possibly cure -- the disease that is the nation's second-leading cause of death.  \"The research will be highlighted next week in Detroit during the World Stem Cell Summit, a gathering of 1,200 prominent stem cell scientists, industry leaders and advocates from 30 countries.  \"But the trial means much more to Mary Diesing, who for eight years has battled breast cancer that has spread to her bones, spine and liver. \"This is my last hope,\" said Diesing, 69, who's been traveling 500 miles from her home in Indian River, Mich., in recent weeks to participate in the trial. \"My doctor told me either I do this or go into hospice.\" The World Stem Cell Summit was first held in Texas five years ago as a response to outcry over research using embryonic stem cells -- derived from leftover embryos from a couple's fertility treatment. But the summit has evolved to include work on cord blood cells, regenerative medicine and adult stem cells, from which cancer stem cells originate. Among the speakers will be U-M Comprehensive Cancer Director Max Wicha, who launched the trials to block breast cancer stem cells that Diesing is enrolled in, and has since begun collaborating with other pioneering scientists to make Michigan a leader in the field. \"We rarely use the 'C word' -- cure -- but the intent of research today is not to study (cancer) but to treat and ultimately to beat it,\" said Jeffrey Trent, president and director of the Grand Rapids-based Van Andel Institute, which is planning to partner in the future with Wicha. \"There is so much hope that we're positioned today with the information from the (human) genome, with the biologic expertise and understanding of the stem cells, I think we can be at the vanguard of treatments that hopefully will lead toward not just longer, disease-free survival but quite literally cures. That's the hope of the cancer stem cell approach.\"   This is really exciting news indicating there might be a breakthrough in curing this disease during the lifetime of many women here.   For more information , read the entire article..   www.detnews.com/article/201009...  Dx 8/9/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Thanx for saying what I've been feeling about this woman.  I am really beginning to have my doubts.  She is the kind of person who seems to have very little time, she forms her opinions without my input and is annoyed when I tell her things that that contradict her ideas.  No, she has no idea what I went through.   Yes, I did go through a living hell and  I began to wish that I could just die right away and get it all over with.  I never want to go through that again.   This is the same oncologist who insisted I had no infection when I had pertussis, who refused to give me antiobiotics though I begged for them before chemo  Then, a few weeks later she decided she changed her mind and gave me antibiotics.  The antibiotics helped, but things started to get worse, I knew I had a inflammation because I know how my immune system overreacts, she disagreed and refused to give me steriods because I might still have an infection.  She told me that I had lung cancer and the best thing for me was chemo.  She was wrong on everything.  The chemo did nothing but exacerbate the inflammation and the radiation damage and spread the inflammation to a much larger area of my lungs; this is what the pulmonologists told me. These months that I have been under her treatment are a time when my health and quality of life have been close to zero.  It has been a horrible ordeal and it was not necessary.  Why should I trust her now?  And what will I have to deal within in the future?  She also made very little effort to get me a procedure that I really need, that can save my life.  I don't know whose side she's on, but it doesn't seem to be mine.  If there's one lesson I've learned in life it is to be commander of your own ship.  No one else knows or cares about YOU better than Yourself and if you are going to survive at anything you have to be pushy.  You cannot depend on others to fight your battles as well as you can.

It is a one shot deal and cannot be repeated. I've had lots of PMs and requests for the surgeon's name, and I've been told I am the *first* breast cancer patient he is considering and that it is possible that I might be approved on that basis.  When I have my appointment on December 1 we'll all find out.  Please PM me if you are still interested in the surgical procedure and cannot wait until spring.

I am taking a chemo holiday this month to give my lungs and body some time to recover from the massive lung inflammation I am being treated for and recover from my last traumatic chemo blast.  My oncologist is not happy.  She actually wants me to take something like cisplatin-navelbine next time after other doctors have told me to never to do this if I want to stay alive. She was hostile and disdainful last visit because I went to the ER after chemo, kept me waiting and hour and a half--causing me to miss a later appointment. Scornful because I am in a wheelchair (I was very shaky and tired and my knees felt like jello that day)...you'd better get out of that wheelchair if you want to get accepted into a trial she says.  I had found an ongoing study that I thought would be perfect for me, one that is doing liver perfusions that expose the liver to high levels of chemo without hurting the rest of the study.  She called at my request and had one of her nurses called me this Monday to let me know they were not taking new patients....too bad, so sad...but that was that. No dice. I decided to make another call myself.  To make a long story short I was connected to a message machine but within 5 minutes a very friendly, sympathetic man who I'll call Jay called me back.   He turned out to be the administrative head of the organization that has been running this liver research project for last few years.   After a short discussion of the seriousness of my situation---my oncologist has told me two months to live without effective treatment--he told me he had a doctor at the University of Pittsburgh who was a close personal friend of his who would perform the procedure for me. He told me to call him immediately, if I didn't hear back within 24 hours to let him know, and predicated on that by telling me to feel free to call him anytime about anything at all. This doctor is the only person in the country performing these procedures, which he does as a surgery.  I called and left a message, but Jay obviously had made some calls too, because early the next day I got a number from the doctor's office from people who were seemed well informed about my situation and got me all set up.  My first appointment is set up for Dec. 1 and if all goes well, I will have this surgery before Christmas.  The procedure is generally 100% successful at eliminating cancer from the liver, the expected outcome is no progression...so I'll have my dream come true of being NED before Christmas!! Of course there may still a few hurdles to jump before I get there...but I'm putting on my ruby slippers and I'm ready to take off (and also thinking about changing oncologists).

      "Content": "bopeep wrote: Hey Gals, Haven't had a working computer or much to report in the way of news for a few weeks except that I am S L O W L Y getting over my chemo disaster of two weeks ago.  I am still very short of breath, my fingers are numb, but my lungs are working well.  I can go for walks every day but I sound like an old lady huffing and puffing around the house.  I've been having fun rearranging rooms upstairs and getting them ready for a special guest this Christmas and happily planning on being alive for the holidays. I am taking a chemo holiday this month to give my lungs and body some time to recover from the massive lung inflammation I am being treated for and recover from my last traumatic chemo blast.  My oncologist is not happy.  She actually wants me to take something like cisplatin-navelbine next time after other doctors have told me to never to do this if I want to stay alive. She was hostile and disdainful last visit because I went to the ER after chemo, kept me waiting and hour and a half--causing me to miss a later appointment. Scornful because I am in a wheelchair (I was very shaky and tired and my knees felt like jello that day)...you'd better get out of that wheelchair if you want to get accepted into a trial she says.  I had found an ongoing study that I thought would be perfect for me, one that is doing liver perfusions that expose the liver to high levels of chemo without hurting the rest of the study.  She called at my request and had one of her nurses called me this Monday to let me know they were not taking new patients....too bad, so sad...but that was that. No dice. I decided to make another call myself.  To make a long story short I was connected to a message machine but within 5 minutes a very friendly, sympathetic man who I'll call Jay called me back.   He turned out to be the administrative head of the organization that has been running this liver research project for last few years.   After a short discussion of the seriousness of my situation---my oncologist has told me two months to live without effective treatment--he told me he had a doctor at the University of Pittsburgh who was a close personal friend of his who would perform the procedure for me. He told me to call him immediately, if I didn't hear back within 24 hours to let him know, and predicated on that by telling me to feel free to call him anytime about anything at all. This doctor is the only person in the country performing these procedures, which he does as a surgery.  I called and left a message, but Jay obviously had made some calls too, because early the next day I got a number from the doctor's office from people who were seemed well informed about my situation and got me all set up.  My first appointment is set up for Dec. 1 and if all goes well, I will have this surgery before Christmas.  The procedure is generally 100% successful at eliminating cancer from the liver, the expected outcome is no progression...so I'll have my dream come true of being NED before Christmas!! Of course there may still a few hurdles to jump before I get there...but I'm putting on my ruby slippers and I'm ready to take off (and also thinking about changing oncologists).

This is a time to trust in God.  A few months ago, when I first got my dx, I made a pilgrimage to St. Joseph's Oratory in Quebec, which sits on a very high hill.  There are steps for worshipers to climb kneeling.  I prayed for a cure on each step and my knees got very sore.  I got no clear answers, but when I was more than half way up I did some to hear a voice from somewhere...

I had two sets of woods along my route (right in my neighborhood) where I could escape, get behind a tree, and whammo!!!  A total cleanout every time.   I was always afraid someone would see me or figure out what I was doing.

I am considering taking taxotere again, but this time my insurance will pay for neulasta.  It's supposed to be one of the most toxic chemos out there, but one of the most effective and produces the most longevity.  But at what cost?   I will have to consider that as well too.  Welcome here and I promise, the worst is over!

A good massage can solve the lymphedema problem...I never went to a specialist.  One night when I was on the telephone my husband grabbed my arm and started a massage, he seemed to put his heart and soul into  it.  When he was done my arm felt fine and I never had another symptom.  BTW, I'm outta here for a while and back to chemo, but I'll be checkin on ya!!

Chainsaw, sorry to hear about your lung mets but glad to see they've reduced. I have been on AIs for 4 years.  I was off for a few months and back on in July.  But when I switched to Aromasin in August everything went hayware and I started getting a lot of progression.  I switched right back to Femara but the progression just continued.  Somehow a switch got thrown. Sometimes ER+ go negative twith distant mets or ER+s get resistant to AIs, that is why I am anxious to start chemo, and like you, said, I want it give it GOOD KICK IN THE BUTT. Bonnie and Meima, thank you again for your sweet prayers and support.  Every prayer means a lot to me. XXXXOOOO ",

The encouraging news is that chemo appears to be working very well in the liver anyway (just one treatmnet), so it will probably work on lung mets as well.   For those of you that recovered from lung mets...did you get rid of it completely, or does it come back in a different place?   Bo ",

I am now fearing the worst.  I got a light sore throat at the beginning of September and I've had a cough that has been getting worse and worse. Saturday I had such a terrible coughing fit that lasted for 6 or 7 minutes I couldn't breathe so I decided to go to the ER.  They gave me a breathing treatment, an inhaler, and prednisone.  I thought I was seeing signs of improvement when I stayed home today and got some rest and I was feeling more optimistic. But I start to cough as soon as my husband got home because I was talking. And then we took our usual walk...going up the hill the cough began again frantically.  I cough whenever I need to breath deeply into my lungs.  I just hope its not too late.  I see my new oncologist tomorrow.  Asking you again for your support and prayers...thank you..

My problem is that I have had a serious lung inflammation for about two months now from whooping cough that has weakened my stamina and makes it very difficult for me to deal with chemo.  I was first treated with Taxol which I tolerated well, but unfortunately the Taxol was not controlling the cancer.  I had an infusion of Navelbine and Carboblatin last Tuesday that knocked me totally off my feet.  I was in the hospital for two days for extreme breathlessness and fatigue, I am now home, but still very very weak and recovering very slowly. Physically, I don't think my body is going to be able to handle any more traditional whole body chemos for at least month or possibly longer.  I have extensive cancer in my liver that needs to be stopped before it starts to spread. A targeted chemo to the liver could do a lot for me right now. Please let me know if any of you know where I might find treatment. Thank you very much!!!!!

I was 4 years out after a lumpectomy and clean nodes, ER+, PR-, Her-.  Oncotype score 36.  My oncologist took me OFF Femara last March because she thought I was over the danger period and she wanted to give my bones a break.  She had very little clinical experience. Three months later I had a lump under my arm, then two lumps.  They were removed with unclean margins and another tumor left behind.  My new oncologist showed me pictures of my liver with some small spots and told me \"I am 80% sure there are cancer, but I don't want to do a biopsy because I'd probably get a false positive.\"  Meanwhile like an idiot I am hoping those spots are anything BUT cancer and I am very concerned about this sloppy surgery under my arm with a suspicious lump I can still feel.  My surgeon is on vacation.  So I talk to a couple of other surgeons who see STAGE IV written all over my charts and they simply shake their heads and decide to do nothing.  I call my oncologist for help and he is unconcerned, he whispers in my ear \"I think you have cancer all over your body!\" There is no evidence for this.  I am told to get back on AIs and they will take care of everything.  Well they didn't. Since my surgery my tumor markers are up to 60 from 28, and my liver enzymes have doubled and jumped out of normal range.  Something is very very wrong with this picture. I have not discussed this with my oncologist because my appointment keeps on getting rescheduled for more important things, like getting going with radiation, and the liver biopsy my radiologist just ordered for me.  We are not sure what kind of results we will get from this because the spots are so small.  I have no mets anywhere else in my body, no bone mets, except for an almost microscopic shadow on a lung. I feel that I cannot trust my oncologist, or even my surgeon, who did such a sloppy surgery.   I feel like they have all written me off...why bother, she's Stage IV.  I want to be anything BUT stage IV.  I want to fight this as aggressively as possible and at least get a few years, and now I am wondering if I am even going to get a few months.   I have been so terrified of what is happening to me and not going to happen that at times I have felt suicidal.  Just get it all over with right now and then I don't have to deal with this.  But this would not be fair to my family, who I love dearly.

My social worker (who comes free with to all patients at the cancer center I go to) has been suggesting that I need to try another oncologist.  There are some good people here; I don't really want to change institutions because there are some positives:  my radiologist is wonderful, the women are wonderful and its very close by.  The problem with my surgeon is that he is very highly thought of around here, and I think he was just over-worked and tired when he did my surgery and everyone is trying to protect his reputation. When I see another oncologist (I am going choose the head honcho here who has a lot of experience and published research on breast cancer), I am going to ask him to fine me another surgeon.  If I get a negative liver biopsy, I am going to ask for a radical mastectomy that removes *everything* in that area including *every* axillary node.  No reconstruction. My worst fear is that the rise in the tumor markers is from the sloppy surgery and things ARE actively spreading to my breast and arm pit... I can already feel a new lump. Thanks for being concerned.  I've feel like just a loner, everyone is treating me like I am nothing but a nuisance. ",

I do not want to the university, but I guess I have no choice.  The last time I got a second opinion there was after the aforementioned surgery.  I was told my original surgeon was held in such high regard that they wouldn't treat me. The consulting surgeon said he was going to call my doctor personally to make sure I was seen right away; well he did make the call, but my surgeon offered only to see only after a few months had passed.  I keep going in circles.

I had a terrible visit with my oncologist after I got the news today.  He was smiling ear to ear and offering me options like tamoxifen.  I told him I wanted Big Guns liked taxotere and he told me that wouldn't work because I already had taxotere; it was my first chemo--you know the prophalactic one.  I do not trust him at all.  I will never see him again and he offered to do nothing for me. I've done taxotere; it was pretty strong and I had a lot of problems with infections, but I'm wiser now and I'd do it in a heartbeat if I thought it would be effective.  I am very puzzled because my latest biopsy from the recurrence under my arm in July was 90% ER+.  I think the liver cancer is something different...maybe it's just liver cancer.  It's not responding to the AIs but the tumors under my arm did. I have an appointment next week with another oncologist at a different hospital.  She's got great credentials and I think she can help.  In the meantime I'm scared to death.  I read my original petscan report (I had to get copies of everything for the referral) and it described the cancer in my liver as \"innumerable small spots on both lobes.\"  That was when my tumor markers were only at 38.  Now they are 97.   I am afraid the cancer is spreading everywhere. Sorry for being so negative.  It seems like I've just had one bad break after another with my treatment:  sloppy surgery, oncological incompetence (taking me off the AIs for example), lots and lots of mistakes and delays that are too numerous too mention. I can't believe how unlucky I've been and how badly I've been treated, but I'm not the only one whose gotten bad treatment on these boards, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much.  I just wish something GOOD would happen for a change. Thanks for all your posts.  Hopefully I'll have something nice to post before too long.  ",

I read an article somewhere here on the BC site that you can actually treat hormone positive cancers that no longer respond to the AIs with small amounts of estradiol.  The estradiol causes some of the cancer cells to die, and the ones that remain are re-sensitized to the AIs. In any case, there is a study going on that I hope to participate in, where you try different chemos and your blood is monitored for cancer cells which are examined to gauge whether or not the treatment will be effective.  That way, they can get you OFF something that isn't effective before there is too much more progression and try something else.   Sometimes things go around in circles...drugs that were ineffective once become effective again.  As cancer evolves, treatments evolve to keep up with them.  That's the general idea anyway.",

I think if I had just taken a break for one or two weeks I could have gotten right back on Femara with no problem.  The most serious SEs were gone within that time.  I've also read about other women taking a break for just a week, and coming back to femara with side effects greatly reduced.  I eventually started taking Femara again 4 months later--when I found a lump under my arm.  I had no SEs at all when I restarted. Another oncologist decided to switch me to Aromasin with no break after Femara.  At that point my tumor markers started spiraling and haven't stopped  My liver enzymes doubled and quadrupled.  I stopped responding entirely to all the AIs and my cancer is now acting like its triple negative.  So I am really spooked about that experience with Aromasin.  I say, stick with what works.  Just take some breaks.  Think about getting injections for your bones.

RobinWendy and DarleneDenise, You were the first two that chimed in and you gave me detailed, strong and good advice.  I read every word and thought everything over carefully.  I have now FIRED my oncologist.  Yesterday I met with my new oncologist who has excellent credentials at an NCI university.  She and her nurse oncologist spent nearly three hours with me going over my history and making a plan. They are on top of the latest research, very knowledgeable, and feel positive about the outcome.  They are setting me up to start Taxol on Monday with more scans and tests this week.  They plant to meet with me on Monday, so If the scans and tests show changes that might poin towards a different therapy they will be ready to go with it.  Things happen very quickly around here! If the Taxol doesn't work, they will switch to other chemos until they find one that does.  My bloodwork will be monitored frequently.  I am also going to be part of a study that looks at circulating cancer cells after the first cycle of treatment, to assay whether or not the treatment is working, so that a switch can be made early on. Chainsaw, Becky, Gingerbrew, Ead, Apple, Chrissy, Nopey, Lowrider, Bernicky, Bonnie, Lowrider, Lane, Marybetz, Meg, Lori, Cat, Chrissy...you all added to the chorus and gave me the confidence to go through with the right decision.   Mandy, Vilma,  and Lori thanks for your prayers and good wishes. Scuttlers and Bambaloos, it was so very kind and caring of you to offer your own cancer treatment center in Houston as a possible place for me.  This meant a lot. Allison, you were SOOOO right.  My thoughts exactly  So, I am going to get the treatment I need and the plan is to get me NED or stable within the next 3/4 months.  I am not worried about losing my hair.  I've heard Taxol is a lot gentler than Taxotere which I had 4 years ago so I am not concerned, I've also heard that the taxanes after often the best first line treatment for Stage IV recurrence.  Feeling very positive. I am so grateful that you all were here.  It made a big difference for me.  Hope I didn't leave anyone out.  You ALL much such a difference.

I was 4 years out after a lumpectomy and clean nodes, ER+, PR-, Her-.  Oncotype score 36.  My oncologist took me OFF Femara last March because she thought I was over the danger period and she wanted to give my bones a break.  She had very little clinical experience. Three months later I had a lump under my arm, then two lumps.  They were removed with unclean margins and another tumor left behind.  My new oncologist showed me pictures of my liver with some small spots and told me \"I am 80% sure there are cancer, but I don't want to do a biopsy because I'd probably get a false positive.\"  Meanwhile like an idiot I am hoping those spots are anything BUT cancer and I am very concerned about this sloppy surgery under my arm with a suspicious lump I can still feel.  My surgeon is on vacation.  So I talk to a couple of other surgeons who see STAGE IV written all over my charts and they simply shake their heads and decide to do nothing.  I call my oncologist for help and he is unconcerned, he whispers in my ear \"I think you have cancer all over your body!\" There is no evidence for this.  I am told to get back on AIs and they will take care of everything.  Well they didn't. Since my surgery my tumor markers are up to 60 from 28, and my liver enzymes have doubled and jumped out of normal range.  Something is very very wrong with this picture. I have not discussed this with my oncologist because my appointment keeps on getting rescheduled for more important things, like getting going with radiation, and the liver biopsy my radiologist just ordered for me.  We are not sure what kind of results we will get from this because the spots are so small.  I have no mets anywhere else in my body, no bone mets, except for an almost microscopic shadow on a lung. I feel that I cannot trust my oncologist, or even my surgeon, who did such a sloppy surgery.   I feel like they have all written me off...why bother, she's Stage IV.  I want to be anything BUT stage IV.  I want to fight this as aggressively as possible and at least get a few years, and now I am wondering if I am even going to get a few months.   I have been so terrified of what is happening to me and not going to happen that at times I have felt suicidal.  Just get it all over with right now and then I don't have to deal with this.  But this would not be fair to my family, who I love dearly. Right now things don't look very good.  Dx 8/9/2010, IDC, Stage IV, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Mon..you are right about checking the biology of the liver, this is exactly what I wanted to do because I am wondering if the liver problems are even related to the breast cancer.  They might be entirely something different.  And Jenny, if the liver turns HER+ that would be very good news as well. Flachica, you all had seemed to have had a good recovery from liver mets; I hope my experience is as good.  Makes me feel positive.  Geez...it's great to have anything to feel positive about about after a Stage IV dx!
