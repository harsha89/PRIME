    "Content": "kristingivot wrote: I'm coming from a VERY strong family history of breast cancer. I have MRI's and Mammograms regularly, I know doctors are being aggressive but I am always needing to have biopsy's whenever something suspicious shows up. I'm not complaining about the doctors watching me so closely but when is too much? Every time I wonder is this it? It is a matter of when and not if in my mind. I am about to schedule myself for another biopsy and this time I have asked to see a genetic counselor. I have been tested for the BRCA 1 and 2 and the BART and they were negative as well as my sister, my mother and my aunt who have all had breast cancer and it came back negative. I'm tired, I'm frustrated and I don't know what else to do. Log in to post a reply",
