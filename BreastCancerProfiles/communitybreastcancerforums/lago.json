I do think as more women suffer permanent hair loss taxotere will no longer be considered as the first choice drug.",

The sleeve is too short, I don't need the silicone banding and they are not too pleased with the brand (medi) for me. They felt I should get a jobst.

I was about 5-6 pounds of fluid heavier with out it. My legs were super shiny and my belly was so bloated. So far I seem to be doing OK weaning off. It appears the bloat was left over from chemo. I had at least 8lbs of fluid from chemo. I had a really bad case of the shingles not too long ago. I did take 1/2 a Norco twice one day pain was so bad. This was the first time in my life I ever took a narcotic. (Didn't need any during chemo or after my BMX). I became constipated as well as nauseous and spacey. IMO the pain meds wheren't worth the SE. I wen't back to taking ibuprofen. At least it took the edge off the pain. LadyinBama several of the women on the Illinios thread (including me) are having flare ups that doen't seem to be resolving. I think mine is a litte better but we are having even more humid, hot & rainy weather this week.",

It is thought that you have a higher risk by some but not others. That said I had cording in my right arm (4 nodes) but no cording in my left/cancer side (10 nodes). I have LE in my left arm but none in my right. So unless your PT said specifically you have LE, cording does not  mean an automatic diagnosis for LE.

The machine tends to constrict much higher than the manual. After chemo was over I then made them take it in my leg. I find that my ankle is the best place. Still runs high but still in normal range. The issue with blood draws is, A. the have to constrict your arm and B. the actual stick could cause infection. With 2 nodes your risk is greatly reduced but it's still there. In my case since I do have LE in my 10 node are (much to my BSs surprise since I'm thin, etc.) I don't want to risk my other arm, which is my dominant arm. Right now I still have a port so I have them do blood draws from there. All IVs I've had done in my foot. I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the future because most places don't like to draw blood from the foot. There is a higher risk of infection from your foot than your arm.",

But I still agree that some of the cuts make sense. I am not a fan of cutting mammos for under 50. I actually think that those with dense tissue need US/MRIs. I know my tumor in the posterior region would have been found before it reached over 6cm but my dense tissue hid it. I had to go in with a blood nipple before they found it. Might have saved me a breast or two, chemo, herceptin, reconstruction. Really the MRI would have been a lot cheaper if it caught this when it was just DCIS and I wouldn't have had chemo/Herceptin.

All this grade, size, node status stuff is used to stage your cancer. Staging helps to decide what treatment you need. They won't be able to truly stage you till you remove (surgery) the cancer and they biopsy it. Seriously I went in to surgery with my breast surgeon pretty sure I was going to be a stage IIIA.

I'm not upset by this at all.",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2012 05:41AM - edited Apr 7, 2012 05:42AM by lago I think you are missing the point. They are not saying don't give treatment to stage IV. They are talking about a point in time when treatment should be stopped because it is ineffective and will only ruin the quality of life. I know I have been told stories of people who have had loved ones killed by the \"last ditch\" try at chemo. I know my MIL died of lung cancer. They tried chemo but her end of life quality would have been terrible if they continued and she was dying. She was 86 years old and while my MIL would have wanted to live longer chemo would have only made her last days/months even worse.They all knew she was dying. The goal was to keep her as comfortable as possible. I do agree that there are a very few cases that beat the odds but it's so few. Our medical/insurance costs are so high that some people can't even get good treatment because they can't afford it. The medicare system here is so burdened that if something isn't done sick elderly won't be able to afford any cancer treatment bbecause medicare will only pay a small portion of it. Right now it looks like anyone who is younger than 55 will not be eligible for medicare till they are 67. (That would include me). Remember no one can tell you when your number is up but a good doctor can tell when it's time for hospice just like there is a time for scans. I do believe good doctors are already doing this. I know my onc doesn't  scan for low risk of mets in early breast cancer unless there is a symptom. She doesn't do tumor markers either because they are unreliable.She also prescribed Anastrozole instead of one of the non generic from the get go with me. Basically she is doing everything recommended in that article all ready. Most of us never see the \"bill\" till after treatment in the US. I think this is part of the issue too.  Coolbreeze I don't know what my post count has to do with this.You know most of the time I post support for others in my posts. As far as disingenuous, hardly. I've also had 2 grandmothers pass from cancer. One from colon cancer the other lymphoma both found at stage IV. Both were in their late 60's which IMO is pretty young. My grandmother who had colon cancer did chemo for a while. It extended her life for 4 months but event she chose to stop\u2026 the SE weren't worth a \"maybe\" a month or so.  I would think a doctor could see this.  I am not being disingenuous. I really hope, if I ever had to face this (knock on wood) that I know when it's time to stop. I understand the drain on the system. I don't want to drain the system so people (including children) can't get care because I might be getting expensive treatment that won't offer any value. Before my BMX I did have a \"do not recesistate\" etc form that I signed.  You are all entitled to your opinions. This is just mine. Reading \"Welcome to the Monkey House\" when I was in my 20's made a huge impression on me. Sorry for posting in the IV thread but this is an issue that effects everyone. The discussion includes scanning for early stage so that would be me.",

I don't know what kind of meds you have been given to control the SE. Some things can't be controlled by meds. (I got that rare SE were all my finger nails and some of my toe nails lifted, are sore, ooze, smell as well as a few fell off. Very gross and uncomfortable but I'll live). Things like heart burn nausea, low white counts, thrush all have meds. For mouth sores I sucked on ice during infusion and it seemed to keep them at bay. Not much they can do for the stiffness although mucle aches can be managed with Aleve if they let you take that. Sometimes you really need to push your onc. All through chemo I kept gaining 4-5 lbs overnight then once I took the steriod the day before chemo it dropped off. Now that I'm off chemo the fluid kept coming on. My legs were so bad you couldn't see my ankles. Finally they put me on a low dose diuretic. I have lost 8.5lbs in 3 days! Yes you need to be a squeaky wheel sometimes to get them to realize the issue.  When you look good they sometimes don't realize. Yes we lost our hair but it looks like you (just like me) have hung on to your eyebrows and lashes. I hope you can make it through the last AC. I have A is really rough.

I had a pretty big break out. Still a bit itchy at night but I'm function again.",

The reason you are treated at a center is because you can be watched and attended to immediately if there is a problem. I too was very scared at my first round. It was totally uneventful. I hope you are like most of us and don't have this allergic reaction but remember if you do your are around people that know what to do.

It's the same reason why they removed your primary tumor. You get chemo just in case there are some cells that did get a way and are in other parts of the body that need to be killed. Finally chemo is still a crap shoot. Sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it does. Most of the time it does or they wouldn't give it to us but of course we know there are times when it does not. If you know there is cancer then best to cut it out if you can\u2026 that goes for the nodes too. I always joked that my cancer center tends to treat on the aggressive side.

It does appear that with hormome positive that risk is always there where as the risk does seem to go down for hormone negative after 3 years. No treatment of course increases that chance. Here are some links on recurrance: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1248209720080812  Note at the end of this article: \"\u2026The study found that women who had tumors known as estrogen receptor positive, in which the hormone estrogen is driving the tumor, had a higher risk of these late recurrences compared to women whose tumors were not this type. Women who had low-grade, or less aggressive, tumors, actually had a higher risk of late recurrence than women who had higher grade tumors, Brewster said. \"That was certainly a finding that we were surprised to see\u2026\" http://www.gaeainitiative.eu/word_page/BC_Recurrence.htm http://www.lifeabc.org/risk_recurrence_more.html  ",

Did your BS say why he recommended a mastectomy over a lumpectomy?  My BS said MX but I had a larger 5.5cm tumor (not including a small part that was DCIS) and small breast. Way too much tissue would have to be removed so a lumpectomy was not possible. We both decided the other should go too based on the results of my MRI. I understood why lumpectomy was not an option on one breast and why it probably wasn't a good idea on the other. Doesn't sound like your BS has explained why s/he is recommending the MX over the Lumpectomy. You need to understand why. It might not have to do with the low grade/small size but with your history of DCIS. BTW DCIS is typically high grade.",

They have much better meds now to combat a lot of the SE. I have seen both my grandmothers (colon, lymphoma) pass away from cancer as well as MIL (lung) a few years before me.

If she is HER2+ this is a very aggressive tumor that needs to be treated with Herceptin to have significantly better outcomes. Problem is Herceptin is rarely given without chemo because it works better with chemo. Hopefully she will not be HER2+ . Typically they test everyone for HER2+ these days because Hercepin makes that much of a difference in prognosis for those of us who need it. It seems breast cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger patients. Even I was considered young (diagnosed at age 49) and as you can see had a very aggressive fast growing tumor.  Sounds like she is slowly coming to terms with her condition. Just don't overwhelm her but she does sound like she is listening. Remind her that the drug companies may make a lot of money on chemo but the insurance companies don't like to pay for it. It is kind of a check and balance in my mind. I know a lot of alternatives claim that the drug companies have a cure but make too much money on cancer drugs so they won't publish the info on alternative. They also claim that the doctors are getting kick backs from the drug companies. There is this big conspiracy theory that is just BS. If you are going to a good treatment center this is not the case. I don't know of one oncologist out there that wouldn't love to see a cure or a treatment without so many SE. BTW chemo is supposed to work best on fast growing cancers (ones that are grade 3, and/or HER2+, triple negative etc.) Hopefully this info will be presented to her.",

The theory is to let the body heal itself. While I do believe out bodies do this most of the time, if you get cancer you body isn't doing it. So many of us here have had perfectly healthy life styles and \"did nothing wrong\" but still got cancer. I personally favor complimentary not alternative. This is because I feel there are many things that have to be in place in order to get cancer. You can't solved the problem with just one method in most cases especially the later the stage cases. While a stage 0 or I might be able to just do surgery and holistic and have very successful outcomes I have seen those successes go way down as the stage goes up. I would try to get you relative to talk with women that have gone through this. I would also talk in terms of complimentary. Explain that she can build her body back up after chemo with complimentary. BTW I have to add that I did the bilateral mastectomy, 10 nodes one side, 4 nodes other side, 6 rounds of chemo, a full year of Herceptin and now 5 years of Anstrozole (now that I'm in perminent chemo-pause) and I feel great.

Odd that the over the counter drug bothered me more. The chances of you getting all those symptoms is pretty slim. Most of them are manageable. No one should be nauseous on chemo these days. If the anti nausea drug the give you doesn't work then make sure they give you a different one. Last round my worst day was day 6 which would be today. I had terrible back pain. This time I took Aleve last night and this morning\u2026 I'm cleaning the house including vacuuming!  ----------------------------------------------------- The actual infusion should not be difficult. They infuse you slowly the first time to make sure you don't get a reaction.  I bring a book but I think next time I will also dig out my old gameboy and play some computer games. It's really uneventful. More of a time suck than anything else IMO. ------------------------------------------------------- Oh and I'm one of those who cut their hair short but didn't go bald yet. I'm pretty thin on top so I don't go out without a scarf. I think my husband is actually getting a kick out watching the transition. Maybe by the end of this week I'll have it shaved before I start to look like Gollum. I have to agree this isn't so bad so far. Granted everyone is different but I was expecting the worst. I hate nausea. Though for sure I would get it. Haven't taken any drugs for it except for the required Emend the day of and 2 days after.",

If she is really young there is a \"Young Women with Breast Cancer\" cancer section with many threads:  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/27 `````````````````````````````````````` I'm 1/2 through my chemo: Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herecepin followed by Herceptin (1 year) with Arimidex and Zometa (I have ostiopenia). Chemo put me in chemopause. I'm 49 (almost 50) so my onc feels that I will not get my periods back. This is why I will be taking an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex. Tamoxifen is usually taken by pre-menopausal women and some post. With triple positives there are SOME women that do not metabolize the drug well. If this is the case then the ovaries can be suppressed with drugs or removed allowing aromatase inhibitor as part of the therapy. Some suggest going the drug suppression first and if that is too much then remove the ovaries. The argument is once the ovaries are gone you can't go back but\u2026 it also might be an age issue. I ended up not having radiation but that's another topic. Usually with a lumpectomy and/or positive nodes,and  large tumors radiation is prescribed.  There are many other factors that require radiation too. SE from chemo. Well I'm doing rather well. I actually worked out for 70 minutes (35 elliptical & 35 treadmill/fast walk) the day after this last chemo. I took it easy just one day and that was more due to the SE of the Nuelasta shot than chemo. I have yet to get any of that tired/weak flu like symptoms. No nausua either. My SE: \u2022 Some back/neck/jaw pain but I'm pretty sure its from that shot \u2022  I had heartburn the first treatment and Prilosec didn't work for me. I'm on prescription Protonix now and it works great. Note that \"Prilosuc\" never worked for me prior to chemo either so I wasn't surprised by this. \u2022  I do have a little neuropathy but not bad. Mostly my left heel goes a little numb. It's worse in the morning but once I start walking on it it's much better. It almost goes away by next treatment. \u2022 Day 3 &4 I could have constipation but I start with the metamucil on night 2 and didn't have the problem this time. \u2022  day 6 my tongue gets a little sore and spicy food irritates it so I don't eat spicy food. Goes away in about 3 days. \u2022 Day 6 My taste buds slightly change but not bad. My only issue is when I decide to cook on those days I can't truly taste what I'm cooking so  I need someone around to make sure I've added enough ingredients. ;) \u2022  Day 8 nose bleeds. This is most likely from the Herceptin but does eventually stop \u2022  Of course I have hair loss. Still some left on my head but very little. I probably should shave it. I lost my arm pit hair and I've only shaved my legs twice in 7 weeks. I also lost quite a bit of  hair \"down under\" Still have my eyebrows although I might have lost some lashes. ```````````````````````````````` Also note that my doctor does precribe lots of meds from the start including Emend, Zyrtec (take daily), corticosteroid, Nuelasta and Prilosec (daily).  Hope that helps a bit.",

You are at a very vulnerable time so it happens. I see you are HER2+ This is a very aggressive form of the disease. They don't do oncotype testing on HER2+ stage II cancers because you will be prescribed the drug Herceptin. Herceptin works better with chemo. Yes there is risk associated with chemo and radiation. I won't lie about that but the risk is low. You should write down all the question you now have after watching that movie and talk to your oncologist or the oncologists nurse practitioner about this.  I will also admit that there is a chance you don't need anymore treatment. Problem is there is know way of knowing except to do nothing and see if the cancer comes back to another part of your body. At that point it's much harder to treat and there is definitely no cure. Chemo isn't fun but you get through it. I finished in January. I've been told radiation isn't near as bad but radiation wasn't recommended for me so I really can't comment with first hand experience. I have to ask, Do you trust some people online you have never met and don't know their credentials over your doctors? Use the information you get online to question your doctors but don't assume it's the truth. For what it's worth I did chemo, now on the estrogen sucking drug and would do it again given what I know. HER2+ is nothing to mess around with! (((hugs)))",

My BS even thought I would at least have a micro invasion\u2026 but my nodes were all clear. Most breast cancer doesn't grow that fast. Many of us have had our tumor for 8-10 years before it will be spotted. In my case because it was so fast growing I only had it for 4 years. A few weeks really won't make the difference. which means you have time for a 2nd opinion. I recommend getting one. You can still go to this guy if you want even after the 2nd opinion. Women do it all the time.",

I spoke with him again today and he extended the antivirals for another week. MOM emu oil would be fine but I really want to touch this as little as possible till the blisters go away. I don't want to spread it anymore. I do hear it can help with the burn in some people. It's highly recommended by rad oncs for those doing radiation. I probably will use vitamin E oil once they have started to dry up since I have plenty on hand from my BMX surgery. The Vitamin E oil worked nicely on both my BMX scars and my port scar.",

It is a SE but rare especially to get it as bad as I did. My nails started to hurt first then lifted. Blood (darkening) underneath several also occurred. Many of them oozed smelly stuff, some did bleed a little too. It was pretty disgusting. I did have to get one toenail removed. A few others fell off. For some reason I didn't loose any of my fingernails although every single one lifted. There was a point where I could only wear my big combat boot type shoes because all my other shoes put pressure on the toenails\u2026 making it difficult to walk. At some point my fingernails all hurt too. One time my thumb actually was throbbing. Even now some of my fingernail beds are still a little tender. I still don't use most of my nails to scrape labels off yet. They are much better now and growing out. Toenails still look like crap but much better. Tomorrow I'll try and take pictures and update this post. 1 more thing. Try to use them as little as possible. Every time you put pressure on them you stress the more. My podiatrist told me this. Be sure to tell your onc about this. I didn't think it was a big deal when it started. I told her about my toes and she wanted to see\u2026 she sent me to a podiatrist. I also saw a dermatologist for the fingers just to make sure they weren't infected. ---------------------- FInger pictures ---------------------- This is when it started. I do have clear nai polish on: linky 1    Black nail polish on. One finger became swollen but no infection. Note the date is Feb 12th but I had my last chemo on Jan 18th: linky 2    Most of the nail polish is off now. You can see some nails do have blood/dark underneath. Finger no longer swollen Feb 21st: linky 3 ------------------- Toe pictures ------------------- Clear nail polish on toes. Bit nail lifted with whitish stuff underneath. It was draining smelly stuff too.:  toe linky 1  This is the gross pictures. The black on the toe is not polish. That is underneath. The skin on my toes also dried out on chemo: toe linky 2 Any other questions feel free to ask. UPDATE PHOTOS from today: fingers   toes  ",

There is a slightly higher risk of local recurrence with lumpectomy but even if that should happen then you would get a mastectomy (mx). Survival is the same. If you do a bilateral MX (BMX) then your chances of getting a new breast cancer goes down significantly. They can't remove all the breast tissue but do get most of it. If you go for the lumpectomy you will be watched closely so they will catch it early if you were to get a new breast cancer. I too was told I am small but my tumor was very large so I had to have at least one breast removed. It is a very personal decision. Also remember if you remove both breasts you will lose sensation in both breasts. You might also want to discuss this with a radiation oncologist. S/He might be able to give you a better idea about what happens to your breast if you radiate it. Lots of women go the lumpectomy and have no regrets, and lots of us go with the bmx with no regrets as well. But no doctor can tell you for sure it will never come back. Granted if you are a stage I and especially if you have no lymph node invasion the chances are very small it will come back if treated. You will not now for sure till surgery what is really in there. Sometimes it's better than they thought. I know initially they told me my tumor was 7cm. Ends up more like 6/6.5cm but only 5.5cm was invasive. That's a lots smaller. BTW I was age 49 at diagnosis. I had no nodes. Just passed the 2 year mark in August. My gut tells me it's not coming back. One final note. If you decide to go with the lumpectomy do tell you BS (breast surgeon) that if he finds more than he thought and you need the MX to go ahead and sign the papers before hand. If you don't give him permission to do that and he does find more he'll have to close you up and schedule another surgery to do the MX. It happened to my neighbor. It's uncommon but best to be ready for everything.",

It really sounds to me that you don't have shingles but I'm not expert\u2026 just been experiencing this for the last 5 weeks. I never stopped taking my Anastrozole. With shingles they do form in a band along a nerve line on one side of your body (arm or face etc). If you don't have this banding again I doubt this is shingles.",

At first it wasn't too expensive but then the rates went up. Still was much cheaper than having to pay for treatment yourself plus you get the insurance discounts. If you are currently insurance there is no 6 month wait period (at leas in the Illinois plan) eventhough it states there is.

So even if everyone still says it's nothing have a follow up in 6 months. Also ask your doctors if you have dense breast tissue, and how dense because in that case I would want an MRI. I didn't have lobular in that breast but lobular cancer is very hard to detect especially in dense tissue and if the tumor is closer to the chest wall. This is something you don't want to be wrong about. Catching it early is so important. You have 2 Signs. Let your doctors know about the increased size and dimple.

Go call your gynecologist and see if s/he can recommend a good breast surgeon for you to see. \"I don't see or feel anything\" is not a diagnosis for a dimple and a breast enlarging. It may not be cancer but why not find out what's causing this. Also if it were to be cancer the sooner you find out the better. My tumor was part non-invasive. It it had been found when the entire tumor was non-invasive I probably wouldn't have needed chemo. keep us posted You have 2 of the sign indicating it could be breast cancer according to the American Cancer Society (linky). By any chance are you young. The only sign I had was I noticed a small amount of blood coming from my nipple (size of a pin prick) in my sports bra. Go to a specialist.

Ended up the MRI testing results came back before BRCA and showed 4 suspicious spots in my \"good\" breast. There was only one they were really worried about. My BS said I would have to be biopsied every year and recommended a BMX. I agreed so we scheduled the surgery before I got the BRCA results because the BRCA results wouldn't have changed my mind. The BRCA results were negative. So yes it's scary to have this aggressive type tumor and in my case had to wait 6 weeks till surgery but even fast growning cancers don't grow that fast unless its IBC.  Oh and that spot of concern did end up being LCIS.

They won't know about the lymph node involvement untill they do a sentinel node dissection or remove even more and dissect them. They can't even be sure of the size of the tumor till they remove it. Initially they said mine was 7cm but ended up only 5.5cm. Biopsy can only tell (but not always 100%) type (in her case Invasive infultrating carcinoma) tumor grade (1-3, this is different than stage), hormone status and HER2 status. The HER2 status takes longer because they must send it out to a specific lab. Usually it takes about 1 week after the biopsy to get all that info\u2026 and then at surgery they retest all those things. I had blood work, chest X-ray and MRI before my surgery. They really wanted to do the MRI to see what was going on in the other breast. Good thing they did in my case. Since my tumor was so large, agressive and HER2+ I had the CT & bone scans before but this isn't always typical. They usually do them after surgery. I saw an onologist 2 weeks after surgery for the first time. Some people have a team set up from the start. Some don't. It really didn't make a difference for me because I wasn't getting chemo before hand. If my tumor was bigger or they thought it has spread to other parts of my body then I would have done chemo first. Nothing wrong with your friend talking with an oncologist now either. If she is concerned the get a 2nd opinion.",

My oncologist said that I would see her every 6 months and my BS ever six months (total of 4 times this year). Then it eventually tapers off over the years to once a year with I think the BS not sure about the oncologist.  Someone needs to be checking that there is no recurrence. Once you have a MX/BMX a physical exam is the only way they can check regularly. If they think there is an issue then they will do other tests.",

My recommendation with your doctors blessing of course is as soon as you start to notice the hair loss start Minoxidil. It can take 3-6 months to start working. At the very least it can help you hold on to your hair. Once it falls out it can be difficult to grow back while on this medication. I use the women's Walgreens generic.",

As far as thicker, it appears that way but what's really happening I believe is more hair is growing at the same time. Hair grows in cycles so while some are at rest others will grow. Now that you've had chemo the cycles take a while before they get out of sync again. Granted you won't go bald again but this is more noticeable with the eyebrows and lashes. About 12-18 months your old hair will return.",

It wasn't pretty, bit painful and the worst part is my nails never recovered. I mean to most people they might think they look OK but I had beautiful nails. Now some are still lifted, they are all brittle and thick. Some of the nail beds on my toenails were ruined so the nail doesn't grow flat and is a breeding ground for nail fungus. From what I have read though in order for the icing to work you really need to keep your fingers & toes really cold. I'm not sure if I could do that. I tried with my fingers with frozen peas but I don't think it was cold enough. Also ask your onc about acetyl-L-carnitine for nueropathy. .",

We did eventually have to change because the old stuff wasn't covering all the new gray. As far as toxicity. I live in Chicago between Lake Shore Drive and another major street with buses. I'm not moving. My point is it is impossible to live completely without toxins. Do your best to reduce them but you still have to live. This may be one of the toxins you choose to remove. I one the other hand will be cremated with my hair colored when that time comes. For me it's more about reducing stuff I ingest and breathe on a daily basis. So much crap in and on food. BTW my mom had been dying her hair since forever. She's 73 and never had breast cancer, or any kind of cancer. Also my oncologist and her NP both dye their hair. No way at their age is that their natural color.

They also have a category called \"Unclassified/normal breast-like.\" I think it's just interesting classification compared to basic staging. As far as \"nearly 50% of those of us dxed with invasive bc go on to develop mets\" We don't know what that statistic encompasses. They might be counting women since the 50's. We don't know how the women were treated either. That article also says my stage IIB prognosis is 65% survival of 5 years. According to my onc if I only had surgery it was 40% (10 years) but with chemo/herceptin/als its more like 84% (2% chance of dying from something else) or basically 14% chance it will come back in 10 years. Just 10 years ago those of us with early BC and HER2+ would have a 50% higher rate of mets than today because of Herceptin. 25% BC is HER2+ so that is a significant number/change in statistic. I have read that hormone suppression has made a huge difference too. I do believe some of these treatments have allowed us to live longer and disease free since the 50's.  Also remember that some people do survive (50%). Why not me?",

I figured nothing would should up anyway before 3 weeks PFC so why stress. As you can see I have a lot of growth even the week before! I was quite the chia pet. Now if only my eyebrows and lashes filled in like my hair but after all this time I think what I have is what I'm going to have. Lashes aren't too bad but I really wish I had a few more brow hairs.

I did stop the Minoxidil during chemo but restarted again. I have a lot of hair but I don't know if its the Minoxidil or would have happened anyway. I do notice that a lot of my receding from before is gone. I hope it stays that way. I lost the lashes & brows 5 weeks after chemo (not completely) but they grew back pretty quickly. Then they thinned again. So far I think the lashes look fine but my brows are thinner than before chemo. It could be the Anastrozole but my onc said its from the chemo and they will grow back. It's been a while so I'm not so sure. I think it's the estrogen sucking drug that's doing it.",

We could drive to Montreal from MA\u2026 I know my mouth cost more than that. Of course now with the price of gas my mouth would be the bargain. Maybe I just mixed things up. cityKat you are on the exact same schedule I was on. Eyebrows fell out after 5 weeks but were coming in at the same time. Eyelashes were slow but still coming in. Right now mine are still shorter than they should be but I know they will get longer. Carberry my top was thin for a bit but it does fill in. I always had a lot of hair. I do feel the hair shaft is thinner so that might be why you think it's thin on top. It helps to use a tripod and timer when taking photos of yourself. I also design websites so this tech part is a no brainer for me. Oh and I do have photoshop so I can push the contrast and brighten up the photo in most cases. I'll admit in most of the photos I whiten the teeth and whites of eyes a little bit. I do have pretty white teeth but do this to photos and everyone will look great. In real life get yourself some crest white strips. You'll look much younger. What is a little creepy is the smile is exactly the same in every photo. My husband noticed this in our wedding album years ago too.

NormaJean65 Thanks. My mom tells me I'm funny all the time. My husband  not so much but I think he's just teasing me. I see him smirking. On the other hand he's a riot. The windy hair loss day and the bird attacking me seem to be real favorites of people here. I'm not sure I can claim being funny on those stories. They pretty much wrote themselves. Now seeing my PS for the first time after chemo(5 months) and saying \"wow you have more hair than me\" was pretty funny. I don't think he was expecting that.When meeting my LE MD and telling him I want my \"Hadassah wave back\" or saying \"stripper boobs\" to my BS\u2026 yes that was fun too. It's fun to laugh as well as see others laugh. Hope everyone is having a nice long weekend. We're still looking for the sun and warmth here in Chicago. Actually today we can't find anything. So far lots and lots of fog.",

I know that many of us on Herceptin experienced the slow growth. I'm still waiting for my nails to look normal. This woman in my building has slow growth hair but her nails look back to normal.

She would try everything to get it not to stick up. So far no one seems to notice it. You need to be close and the light needs to be intense to get the \"glow\"",

Be sure to fill in those eyebrows if they have thinned. Really makes a difference. In IL if you have a perfect driving record they only make you take a picture every 8 years instead of 4. Rachelvk the day before my hair started falling out I called the wig place to tell them it wasn't and maybe I should change my appointment (for the next day). They said keep. Sure enough day 16 it started big time. It took a while for it all to fall out so you will probably be fine for the 1st although I will admit I always had a lot of hair.

If you are that worried try bringing a couple of bags of frozen pees in an insulated bag to chemo and stick your fingers in them during taxol. BTW I'm not sure if this is a SE of taxol.

Granted the 2nd time was because this gal I met was going again and she wanted to see me. Both times I learned something. We had a great gal presenting. If the one you go to isn't any good there might be some others in your area to try. They will only give you the bag of makeup once though. Have you checked out the beauty guide on the site? Lots of great info there too: http://lookgoodfeelbetter.org/beauty-guide I hope if your eyelashes fall out the grow in properly this time. Hey you never know. ",

I thought for sure I would be one of them since I had a receding hair line since I was in my mid 40's and using Minoxidil. I figured I rather be bald then be dead. Well guess what. Not only do I have all my hair back but a lot of the hair that receded came back. Still have some thinning on the left but very minor. Don't assume it will happen. It is very rare. BTW I did get the more rare SE from Taxotere. My nails are still not recovered (15 months out). Nail polish does a great job of hiding that so no biggy.",

My theory is your hair will get a bit more curl or wave depending on the type of hair you had. I had rather straight hair so it got some wave and the few cowlicks are always had were more unmanageable. Seems many of the Asian gals don't get curly hair. Just an observation, no science behind this. Let us know when you start the survey thread. schatzi my hair went back to normal about 1 year PFC but I keep my hair really short. I have read some women say 18 months but that might be because they keep their hair longer.",

They are $$$ and a realy PITA to deal with. Can you imagine if everyone came in with dry ice in coolers with cold caps and how that would get in the way. It seems the chemo nurses are so busy and cold caps would just add more confusion if everyone was doing it. I would hope in the future cold caps and cold gloves/socks would be available to those that do the chemos (taxotere) that could cause permanent damage. (I had the bad nail lifting issue and my nails ever fully recovered). RainMaze I did 6 rounds of taxotere with Carboplatin and my hair came back fine. I read about this 3-6% right after my first TX. I assumed it would happen to me because I was already getting some receding before diagnosis. But it all came back, including a lot of the places it receded. Don't assume it will happen to you. Doing only 4 rounds makes it less likely from what I was told from my friend who has done a lot of research. SLKsMom I was on a different chemo but mine did thin during tx. Then fell out 5 weeks PFC. Came in great then thinned but I think that was from Anastrozole. I have been painting women's Minoxidil on them 1X a day and they are a little bit better and are not shedding anymore.

About a year later the shine started to grow back but remember I keep my hair really short now so the old stuff was all cut off. For shine though I would recommend moroccan oil . It can be really expensive but you only use a little bit (or your hair will look greasy). I found the product they sell at Sally Beauty supply, One n Only Argan Oil, is much less expensive and works really well when I do use it. Not too greasy at all. Sometimes the sun in the summer might dry out my hair a little. It's good for your hair (and hands) too. And I will also agree Carol2's hair grows fast. My does too. Most people do not have hair that grows that fast.",

It is not yet approved by FDA for women but it still can prescribed according to the source below. Also: \"Side effects. Few adverse reactions have been noted in women receiving finasteride. Increased body hair, sweating and hot flashes, and headaches were reported during clinical studies of women receiving finasteride, but those effects were also noted in women not receiving the medication. (See here for a list of side effects reported in men.) Liver concerns. Finasteride should be used with caution by people with liver abnormalities because the drug is extensively metabolized in the organ.\" Bottom line. Finasteride has been used to treat female pattern hair loss and is reported to be effective for some women, but to date there is no good evidence from well-designed clinical trials to support its use for that purpose. Our advice: If you're a woman with thinning hair or significant hair loss, talk with your doctor about a referral to a specialist to look for underlying causes and approved treatments, such as minoxidil (Rogaine and generic). Finasteride probably plays little or no role in reversing hair loss in women with normal or low androgen levels. consumerreports.org/cro/2012/04/can-you-treat-women-s-hair-loss-with-a-drug-used-for-men/index.htm",

Also, since I had nodes take on both sides, LE in one arm and pretty sure LE in the other (no swelling just heaviness) I can use the port for blood draws. Yay Cyborg",

Even your suppliments have some soy. I would discuss this with your onc. Same goes with parabens.  They haven't found any direct  links to breast cancer and parabens. They have low concentrations of them in breast cancer tumors. Also \"Parabens have also displayed the ability to slightly mimic estrogen (a hormone known to play a role in the development of breast cancer\" I think you really need to see how much you are really are exposed to. In most products its very minimal. Again I would discuss this with your onc. Personally I feel car exhaust and 2nd hand smoke are more important to avoid.

I never did lose any fingernails although you can see the new nails growing underneath\u2026 so far no falling off. My toe nails more of a headache. One large nail had to be removed. My other large nail lifted so bad that my podiatrist cut it back really far. It's almost like not having a nail. I lost a few others too.

It warns right on the package that if you use men's you could have an issue with growing some facial hair. I tried men's and that started to happen (although the hairs where blond in color). I switched to women's. I only use it once a day although it says twice. I would not use 5% unless you are directed to by your doctor ( preferably a dermatologist). My NP knows I'm using it again.

Mine came in fairly fast but I did have the male pattern baldness. I am taking 5 mg of Biotin daily and doing women's Minoxidil (generic Rogaine) once a day. Just remember with Minoxidil it can take 3-6 months for it to work. Other's have had luck with Nioxin products. That fact that you have some hair is a good sign. I know there have been others that have had slow growth. Also are you on any hormone therapy. Even chemo-pause will reduce the amount of estrogen in your body. Less estrogen can cause hair loss in some women. I would discuss this with your onc, gyno and/or dermatologist.",

My eyelashes did fall out after chemo but started growing back about 3 weeks later. My eyebrows also fell out but were growing in at the same time so I was never without. Just had some thin spots that were easily filled in with cosmetics. It's been 3 months, nothing seems to be falling out. Matter a fact I think I have more hair is some places. All that over plucking of the eyebrows from jr. high seems to have repaired! It seems to me that most that get their hair falling out a 2nd time is when they get hair back on chemo\u2026 then it falls out during chemo. Sounds to me you hair grows fast anyway so I bet you'll be OK.",

Also some of us did this through winter so that had it's effect too. There is a thread called \"Physical aging appearance\" where others are sharing their tricks and tips for skin. I hope some of my wrinkles around my eyes relax but I'm not hopeful. My nails are still a mess from taxotere. I had a really bad reaction. Every toe/finger nail effected. Fingernails are growing out but some still, even after 13 weeks are lifted. I don't want to even discuss my toenails. I'm expecting them to be better by next spring. But my hair is good so at least that something. eyelashes are slow growing but are growing too. BTW no regrets about not doing cold caps. I don't think it would have been worth the $$, hassle or discomfort in my case.",

You will need to dress it up with earrings. If you choose a scarf that doesn't have a bandanna or tie dye  pattern it can look rather dressy. The other trick is I did tie the scarves so they would at the very least cover the tops of my ears. Letting your ears stick out makes you look more like a pirate too.",

From what others say it does take 18 months to get close to what it was before. Yes I have eyebrows and lashes but both are thinner than when I was on chemo. Crazy. It takes time for all these drugs to get out of us. Some of us have herceptin. Some of us have AI or Tamox. Some of us have drugs from surgery. Drugs to combat chemo effects. All of this takes time to get out of your system. Any/all of these can effect your hair & nails. Surgery can effect hair growth too. ",

You should talk to your onc about this. There is a chance at your age that  your cycle could come back. From what I read it could be a year or 2. The closer you are to menopausal age the more likely it will be permanent. Under 40 I think you have a good chance yours will be back. My hot flashes (night only when I had them) where really not too bad. I never really got sweaty. Just warm. I would talk to your onc about this too.

I'm keeping it short for now but  I do feel in time the old hair will come back. It's just going to take a while. fluffqueen01 I have read some folks complaining that Herceptin will slow hair growth. I just had my last Herceptin 2.5 weeks ago. I sure hope my hair doesn't grow any faster. I feel I'm getting it cut every 4 weeks now as it is. Now my neighbor (we have all the same doctors and treatments except she got rads) finds her hair is growing very slowly. Could be from Herceptin. She is also over 10 years older than me so that could be it too. She really wants to stop wearing her wig and have hair like mine. I explain that there are many women on that their hair just comes in slower\u2026 but it does come back. I think my challenges are my nails(toes & fingers), eyebrows and eyelashes. I have a feeling that could take 2 years and in the case of my toe nails some will always be messed up. Not a big deal. I'm not a foot model.",

I had beautiful, thick, silky bob just above my shoulders. I looked at her and said I was more worried about my eyebrows. I was so concerned that I bought product to fill in my eyebrows before my initial surgery. I did get the wig (my avatar is me in the wig after my 4th tx). I wore it 2x. It was hot, uncomfortable and too big. I wore scarves the rest of the time (and big earrings). One of the pictures here I'm wearing my scarf. I was 1 month PFC: linky   If there is a looks good feel better program near you I recommend going. They will give you make-up tips. It really is all about your face not your hair. (If not all the info is one the site). If you decide to get a wig and you have really thick hair like me I either recommend really shaving your hair down or waiting till it falls out so it won't be too big. Wigs are designed assuming people have some hair so they tend to run big.",

Yes the current stats show women on AIs do better than women on Tamoxifen but it's not huge. Also as some  have mentioned there are a few more serious SE for Tamoxifen, although most don't get them. It seems one of the more serious/common SE for the AI is reduced bone density. Back to hair. You ladies are look great. LovRVing, when I first had my hair dyed it was the same color as yours.

I'm liking both colors on you although I always prefered brunettes 3jaysmom I do believe your hair thinning is a combination of thyriod issues and possible the AIs (I'm assuming you're on them). I had receding on the sides a few years before all this started. Chemo actually got most of it to grow back although I am using Minoxodil & Biotin to keep it going (was using that before too). So far the AIs don't seem to be having an effect on me. Hopefully they can get your thyriod under control.",

But yes if you stop it will start to shed again. Remember what they said to you about breast cancer when you were first diagnosed. \"It's treatable\" meaning it's not curable. Well my receding hairline is treatable but not curable and unlike breast cancer where many of are cured (we just don't know it) this hair loss thing for those of us that have it isn't unless it's caused by a drug or thyroid problem, etc.",

My onc gave me stats for my age and diagnosis that said that out of 100 women who were my age with my diagnosis that only did the surgery\u2026 only 40 of them were alive and cancer free 10 years later. If I did the chemo and in my case hormone therapy my chance of being alive and cancer free went up to 86%. There is no known cure but the chances of being cured are high if you treat it now. Once  you reach stage IV there is no cure. They just manage the disease with treatment (meaning off and on chemo for the rest of your life which could be months or 20 years). If you are on chemo the rest of your life you are not without side effects. So now is your best shot of a cure. I would give up a year of my life (actually more when you include reconstruction) again to have this great opportunity to cancer free and possibly cured. My hair is back and looks great. Also ask your oncologist to explain the risks of ILC. It's a sneaky one and I do believe it might have a higher risk of metastisis\u2026 but please check with your onc on that. I had a bit 6.5cm tumor of IDC/DCIS in the left and a small amount of LCIS on the right. Had to get the MX but once the LCIS was found a BMX was recommended. I did have TEs places at BMX (start of reconstruction) PM me if you what to chat more.",

BTW my lashes and brows thinned but never fell out on chemo. After chemo when they fell out because like I mentioned the new hairs were pushing the old hairs out. I was never completely without though but the lashes were short for a while.",

This red winged black bird attacked me. Figured it was not a regular thing. Next day I looked and saw the bird on a log in the pond. I figured I was safe\u2026 but no it attacked me again from behind . The damn bird was waiting for me. It isn't happening to anyone else walking by. I've been walking around that area. I assume I should be fine once nest season and baby birds are flying. linky ",

Also they do make clip ons still. Even if you can't find what you like you can always buy the clip on findings and have the earrings changed. Usually not that big of a deal.  BTW I wear an ear cuff all the time. I have tons of them. Been wearing them since the early 80's. I could never commit to more piercings. ",

We all look wonderful. I mean seriously looking 50, 60, 70 shouldn't automatically mean looking good is not normal. I think we a programmed to think looking youthful is the only way too look good.

I went up to her and said \"I had that hair cut a few years ago. It does grow back.\" She was so happy I said that to her. Also given my hair is still very short I think it gave her hope that looking \"normal\" wasn't that far away.",

As far as the AI remember you can always try it then if you have SE quit. You're hair will grow back if it falls out on the AI just like it grew back on Chemo. If you are that worried you can always try Minoxidil. That's what I use because it started to recede before chemo due to peri menopause. The generic isn't all that expensive either. But once the cancer has become metastatic you will be battling that the rest of your life\u2026 and it most likely will not be a normal life span. I started this battle at age 49. I've had a few issues with the AIs and I'm on my 2nd one. Most of the SE have gone away on this one. Don't assume the worst.

Lymph nodes are the typical way the cancer cells can escape but they don't know everything about this disease. There are women that do get mets but never had any node involvement (according to our current methods of testing). Highest risk for recurrence is in the first 2 years. After that your risk drops and continues to drop as you get further out. I have read that low grade can recur years later more often than high grade but I don't know how big the study was.",

Most of those 9,800+ posts here were keystroked when I was going through & recovering from treatment . Maybe once they stop hurting and oozing then you could tape them down but not so sure that would be something I would start with.

If you use a flattening iron do not use one that is too wide. They are just to hard to handle. Go for the slim ones. Also if your hair is that short go for the mini ones. I purchased a mini one for my bangs. The can curl a bit on humid days. Much easier to use and you can get closer to your scalp without burning yourself.",

There is a good chance if your husband to be works for a large company that there is no lifetime cap or maximum coverage. There probably is some kind of deductible (amount you must pay before you are covered each year). There is also could be a maximum out-of-pocket (per year)\u2026 this means once you have reached that maximum you will have no more out-of-pocket for the year. There probably is a preferred provider coverage. This means if you see a physician/ treatment center that is a preferred provider they will cover more. For instance the plan I'm on covers 80% of the cost once my deductible is met of a preferred provider. If it's out of network the only cover 60% of what they deem a customary charge for the procedure (usually lower than what they would allow for in-network). So it is in your best interest to go with a preferred provider. There should be some kind of booklet or online information that will explain all of this as well as define some of the terms I'm using. I would ask your husband to be to talk with the HR department about getting a copy. They should be able to provide this.",

They probably want to know how big it really is so they know how to procede after the mastectomy. If they shrink the tumor they will never know. My breast is just too dense I guess. Who knows maybe after the MRI they may change course but I doubt it. They say the MRI is to check the other breast but I'm sure they're going to look at the bad on too. They told me I've had this for 4 years. I've always gone for mammograms.  I am meeting with the surgeon on the 4th so maybe I can get more information or at the very least a surgery date! I have no idea why they are moving so slowly. I'm not worried about the BRCA. I really don't think I will test positive. There is no history of BC, ovarian or prostate cancer in my family to my knowledge. I just feel better safe then sorry. Also this test is still rather new.

Once we decided on BMX with reconstruction I met with 2 plastic surgeons. 2 weeks after my surgery I met with the medical oncologist and then radiation oncologist (got a pass on rads). Depending on the type of initial surgery and diagnosis after surgery will dictate what course of action and who you see next. My oncologist knew about my situation before surgery (Have a relative that works at the treatment center and discussed my biopsy results with her). She (my onc) didn't want to see me before surgery nor did she suggest chemo first. I asked my BS about chemo first and he, at that time didn't recommend it in my case. Granted  it seems now more people with larger and/or aggressive tumors are getting it first especially if they are node positive. Both the physical and MRI indicated I was probably node negative although my PS did worry about micromets. Chemo before or after\u2026 no increase in survival benefits. The good thing about doing it first is you can see if it's working. Good thing about doing it after surgery is they know for sure what is in there. I might have never know my nodes were clear if I did chemo first. If I had micromets good chance chemo would have taken care of it. They might have recommended radiation in that case since I was in a gray area. I'm glad I got out of rads. I did the BRCA testing before surgery as well. Ended up I needed to do the double anyway but I didn't know that because I was waiting for the MRI results. I do recommend BRCA testing before surgery. This could change your mind as to what kind of surgery you want to do if you test positive. ---------------------------------- Bottom line get 2nd or even 3rd opinions but try to go to a breast surgeon/breast center. They will be more current on breast cancer treatment and know what's best for you in your case. If you are node negative and HER2- there's a chance won't get chemo but if you are HER2+ and/or hormone negative you probably will. They will do what's called an oncotype test after they remove the tumor if you are node negative, HER2- and ER/PR+. There is more than one way to treat this disease and they are all good approaches if you are being treated by people who know what they are doing. Hope that makes sense.",

I also ate dried apricots and took Nutraflora (as directed 1X a day) in my water. I still do the Nutraflora because I have IBS and constipation can be an issue. This all helped soften the stool so it was much easier to pass. Meticmucil also isn't bloating. I would start taking it the night of chemo then as mentioned earlier stop when things were back to nomal (about 4-5 days). Milk of Magnesia didn't work for me but hopefully it will work for you",

I assume you are grade 3 too. I am stage IIB only because I have no lymph node involvement therefore I do not have as many treatments as you and didn't need radiation. (Note I was in a very gray area for rads but my rads oncologist didn't recommend it based on all the other treatment I had.) The reason for being so aggressive is your HER2+ status. HER2+ is very aggressive and has a tendency to spread to other parts of the body. When treated you have a much, much, much better prognosis of it not spreading. Your oncologist should be giving you the statistics on this. Although your tumor is DCIS I believe you are being treated for IDC because it has spread to the nodes. I would ask your oncologist about that too. I think you need more information from you oncologist before you decide to stop treatment. I know how tired you must be going through all this. I can only image since I just started chemo and my treatment isn't quite as long. Just remember if you do decide to continue the end of the road is a lot closer than you think.6 more infusions\u2026 only 3.5 months maybe? You've come so far.",

Wrong! Hang in there. This is a great place for support. This first part is the most scary. You'll cry a lot. We all did. It's normal. If you find you get too depressed they will give you drugs for that. Not uncommon.  I found once I had the surgery (and the cancer was out of me) I stopped crying. EDIT: Just wanted to add I am the family history. No women in my family including great aunts have had breast cancer.

Standard care it to remove at least level I nodes (not sentinel) on tumors bigger than 5cm because the probability is at least 80% that there will be some mets in the nodes. My BS was worried I would have micromets. In your case (just my guess, I don't really know) the fact that its in your intramammory node might give a strong indication that  you could have micromets in your nodes. If you did the chemo might have killed it but since you aren't removing the axillary nodes they want to do radiation instead. The risk of LE is a little lower with just rads versus removing lots of nodes. Be sure they measure your arm before rads just in case of LE. You need a baseline. I never got one so we really don't know how much my LE arm swelled. Hope that makes sense.",

I told my PS a little bigger, but I forgot a man's idea of \"little bigger\" when it comes to boobs are quite different then most women's. My reach to recovery partner who I met for the 1st time asked me \"were you always that big?\" Then she said \"the size is perfect for you\u2026 almost too perfect that's why I asked\" She was pretty fun\u2026 as we sat through her first TX of AC!

The next day I went to the Au Bon Pan in the hospital (gown and all) and ate lunch with my husband. Had paste in red sauce with broccoli. Went home that day. I think I had pizza the next day. Lets just say I ate everything but I didn't take any pain medication.  Pain medication can make you nauseous too. If you take it with food in your stomach you will be OK.",

My onc first diagnosed me with LE but didn't send me to a PT. When it continued to get worse I then contacted my PS. He sent me to a specialist who then sent me toa PT.

Once they remove the port my treatment center will not place it back in the same place due to increased risk of blood clots. So once she said that I got paranoid and didn't want to jinx things.

The fabric is lighter and where you bend your arm is thinner so it feels better. My concern though is that the lower part of the arm isn't as tight, almost lose\u2026 which is where I need the compression. I also used to get the long size, I was right on the cusp. This seems to fit correctly in length but I would think if someone really needed a long sleeve they might have issues. I'm afraid I will not be wearing Medi sleeves anymore Anyone else try these?

First of all I didn't need the silicone beads that were irritating my skin. She said that unless you have really big arms you most likely don't need them. (Actually she said unless you have Oprah arms, LOL). I exchanged the sleeve for a long one with no beads and have been wearing them for the past 3 years.  Some of these places will sell you what they have in stock. That's what happened the first time.

If you Er?PR status is positive your onc might feel hormone suppression is enough but if you are triple negative, a very aggressive cancer then s/he might suggest chemo. Also if you are HER2+ your onc might recommend chemo because herceptin ( drug used to treat HER2+) is almost always given with chemo. So IMO you need more information to know either way. Your onc will need the final path information to make this decision. Hope you don't need chemo but it's doable. Just finished 6 rounds of TCH 3.5 week ago.",

Both Christina and Suzanne are survivors as well as human.

She said there was a slight change in my treatment because I have slight osteopina according to the recent bone density test. She will be putting me on Zometa ( every 6 months) when I go on Armidex to protect my bones. She also said that it reduces recurrence of breast caner by 35% as well. She gave me the NEJM print out of the study too: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0806285 She was also concerned with my Vitamin D level because they find people with low D get more aches on Zometa. She's having my vD tested again (was tested last year) to be sure I'm getting enough with my supplements. I'm going through all this eventhough my ER+ is only 30% and my PR+ is 5%... and my gut says it was only in my breasts but I could be wrong so I'm buying insurance with chemo, Herceptin & Armidex).",

I asked her \"how do we know this is working?\" She replied, we don't. Now if you get chemo before surgery they can see if the tumor shrinks but those of us who had surgery first don't know.  There are blood tests but they are unreliable and usually used for those who have distance mets. They give chemo bases on the statistics on how likely  the patient is to have distant mets. The problem is you could have distant mets but it is so small that the scans won't pick it up. Hopefully chemo and it sounds like your mom will get horomone therapy too will take care of any possible micro mets if she even has any. 1 more thing. If your mom gets any symptom like headaches, bone pain, rashes that last more than 2-4 weeks she needs to report this to her onc.  Although all these disease are called \"cancer\" they do behave differently. Even breast cancer has many different types that get different treatments.  My current follow up (after 1 year post surgery) is I see my BS and Onc once a year\u2026 basically I see one of them every 6 months for a physical exam since without breasts they can'd to mammograms anymore. If there were to be a local recurrence it's usually on the scar. That's where they check. I also continue to see my primary care MD and he also knows of my diagnosis. Some people never see their BS again but see their onc every 3 months. It varies with treatment centers.",

Several groups have attempted to define a population of women in whom the probability of nodal metastasis is low enough to preclude axillary node biopsy. In these single-institution case series, the prevalence of positive nodes in patients with T1a tumors ranged from 9% to 16%.[51,52] In another series, the incidence of axillary node relapse in patients with T1a tumors treated without ALND was 2%.[53][Level of evidence: 3iiiA] Because the axillary node status remains the most important predictor of outcome in breast cancer patients, insufficient evidence is available to recommend that lymph node staging can be omitted in most patients with invasive breast cancer.\"  Those studies have small samples. This is why it seems the jury is still out. But even if they are correct, for people like me who had large tumors it appears that ALND is still standard. It also appears it is still standard for non-micro mets in lymph nodes. Sereena has both micro and macro mets in her nodes. Again I am not saying she should do the surgery but find out the rational from her surgeon. These studies indicate to me that further studies need to be done with larger samples. The San Antonio one was more significant because it was the largest study to date. They aren't changing the rules yet for a reason.",

It's not unusual to just \"watch\" LCIS but her history must be considered. I would definitely get a 2nd opinion from another breast surgeon. ILC is invasive. I would want that taken out. Mastectomy is very personal decision. I know what I would do but I really think you need to get further explanation and a 2nd opinion.",

I have to come in due to HIPPA law (says the scheduler). At least I can do that on the same day. I was told my eyebrows thinning are not from the ESD (estrogen sucking drug: anastrozole). Not sure what to do about the nails that are still lifted either. Not sure if I'm going to see a dermatologist about these issues yet but my onc gave me the name of the super special dermatologist. I'm trying to cut down on doctors visits not add them. So my NP says I only have to keep the port 2 years not 3. She was going to check with my onc. Forgot to get that answer.

You should have seen us when we got up\u2026 but withing 30-60 seconds we were better. Cigi56 I have implants (tumor around 6-6.5cm including non-invasive in my former 34 A-B breasts). We assumed I would need  radiation but I was in a gray area and got a pass. My PS was willing to give it a try but there are complications that can happen if you get radiation. Many times the do a Latissimus Dorsi flap (taken from the back) to replace the damaged skin if the radiated skin isn't working/fails.  J-Bug I just saw my friends reconstruction by Dr. Massey*. I think she got one of the bilateral GAP flap procedures. We kid and call them her butt boobs. She had radiation and started with expanders but got some capsular contraction with the expanders. Instead of moving forward she decided on the butt boobs after researching and learning about these procedures\u2026 Some of us (like my friend and myself) don't have enough tissue to take it from the tummy or back. I know if I went in this direction I would have to have a stacked procedure because as much as I kid about having big thighs I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have enough for unstacked. Also remember that Dr. Massey* (as well as some other PS) do not like implants. They tend to only recommend them in cases where these other procedures aren't an option. Guess what I'm saying is all PS have their bias as what's the best procedure. BTW I'm very very happy with my implants. They look awesome but remember I didn't have radiation. I know I didn't want anymore scars so if the implants didn't work I probably would have gone without. *Check out Dr. Massey's site. She does an excellent job listing all the different reconstruction procedures except for Dr. Khouri method at the Miami Breast Center. Congratulations bennetts1 Here's to NED and ESD!",

As far as the hormone positive thing. Yeah with breast cancer the glass is always half full and half empty. Triple negative is the most aggressive and most likely to recur in the first 2 years\u2026 but if you make it past the first 3 there's a really good chance you are cured. With us hormone positive we need to wait 25 years before they will say that. Still, I'm not worrying till someone tells me there's an issue. I could give you my seat belt speech but I like this true story that happened to me 2 weeks ago: I was in a cab and found out my driver was from Pakistan. We started discussing our favorite Pakistani restaurant (we liked the same one). I mentioned to him that it wasn't the healthiest food. He said to me \"Well you got to live.

I have a feeling if there are \"strays\" maybe the are still \"young & stupid\" so chemo, als and or tamox will starve them or stop them from multiplying and setting up camp in organs. Maybe it just gets the \"floaters\" where as once you are  metastatic or mets you have \"cling-ons\" and they are tougher to eradicate. Finally some cells may be in your system but dormant. I'm not sure if chemo, Als, Tamox etc have any effect on dormant cells but I would think not. The cell must be dividing and \"eating\" for them to have an effect. Years later something wakes them up and we get mets. spendygirl We don't keep doing chemo because it is not good for our bodies.  We will end up with other health issue, possible even to get a different cancer. This is why they don't treat mets as aggressively. If they did the body would wear out a lot faster.  Also cancer is very adaptive. With mets the cancer seems to learn and mutate. A drug might be effective for a while but eventually fails but in some cases does go into remission.  SusanGarden My understanding is chemos slow/stop growth.Kinda F@*&s it up. Seems the Als/Tamox remove/block the fuel so they starve it. I don't think it's just a delay. I t hink it has to do with dormant cells. It seems more women in early stage seem to live long lives than get recurrence. We just see a lot of the recurrence and stage IVs on this forum.BTW I'm currently reading \"The Emperor of all Maladies : The History of Cancer\" I'm reading it slowly though. dlb823 you are correct. Bone marrow transplant is not effective for breast cancer. They don't do it anymore.

I questioned my BS not only on the level 1 (and the possibility of level II) and about the sentinel on the other side. I did my research. With a tumor my size the chance of it not being in my nodes was only 20%. We needed to know if the cancer had spread there and to how many. Yes that did effect my treatment. I'm sure radiation would have been recommended if in my nodes and pretty sure I would be on a different chemo cocktail too (from what I have researched). So again don't say you know what I know based on a few posts. My posts do not give medical advice but encourage people to talk with their doctors. You come right out and tell them not to do certain surgeries, hormone therapy, etc. I don't care how much research you have done in the past couple of years as a patient\u2026 you are not an MD. I find you twist the research to fit your needs. Remember not too long ago they felt Zometa prevents bone mets based on a few studies. Now they are not so sure based on a study that refutes it. The research you presented is still not enough to change standard care practices as they stand today. The research only indicates that more studies have to be done. I just don't understand why that doesn't make sense to you. mollyann I find you rude and insulting to me.

In my case there was a 40% chance I didn't need anything other than surgery\u2026 but that's not good odds so I did the chemo and take my estrogen sucker. IMO I'm good unless told otherwise. The bmx was really the best course since I had no choice in the IDC side (small boob + big tumore = MX). The other side showed 4 suspicious areas, one that my BS was concerned about. He said it would have to be biopsied every year. It ended up being LCIS so he was right about the yearly biopsy.  His recommendation after the MRI was to do the BMX\u2026 this is after he initially said not needed, didn't like to remove healthy tissue and talked me out of it. Said \"lets wait to see what the MRI shows). So glad he did an MRI of both breasts. But remember our risk of a new secondary is actually lower than mets  (unless there's a family history or BRCA gene etc) Yes your risk is higher than someone who never had breast cancer but not quite as high as you think. You will be watched carefully too. Remember that you will be numb, no nipple sensation etc. Once its gone no turning back. You can always have it removed later. I would really discuss this with your doctors and get all the facts. I'm not discouraging at all. I'm quite happy to be rid of mine but I will admit I miss my right nipple Also remember those of us that are hormone negative (like yourself, not me) usually have a better chance of no recurrance after 3 years. No gaurantee but pretty good.",

I just might be predisposed. Bethcw Welcome. My tumor was 6.5cm total but 5.5cm of IDC and 1cm of DCIS. It is not uncommon to have combinations of invasive and non invasive at the same time.

Yes I had to get a long sleeve. I don't know why they don't make one for longer fingers. Stands to reason someone with long arms (and legs) would have long fingers too. I would have loved to do one of the lymphedeva products but they don't come in long. YamahaMama itch/soreness between fingers. Initially I did have some soreness in some of the web areas of my fingers when the gloves are brand new.  Once they stretch out a bit (after a 3-5 days) I don't have the issue. I do wash and wear my gloves every day. I might have felt a little cutting off the circulation but I would bend my fingers a bit to stretch them out. Like I said a few says and they're fine. If you look at the photo you can see the ends hit almost right in the middle between the  knuckles At times I remove my glove to wash my hands. When I do house work, wash dishes I put the latex glove right over my compression glove. When I'm preparing food I actually removed the compression glove before I put on the latex glove\u2026 the latex glove doesn't fit as well with the compression glove so when using big sharp knives I don't want to be fumbling. < I use these for housework, washing dishes & food prep",

Cookie the glove & gauntlet I posted are both medi. My LE therapist recommended the site below becuase they have specials every month. Ends up my mom  has been purchasing from them for her compression stockings for several years too:  www.brightlifedirect.com/ YamahaMama  I am not familiar with SassySleeve. Maybe I'll check out Juzo if my LE MD is OK with that brand. My BS always orders Medi sleeve/glove for everyone automatically. When I got my presciption from him it was only for prevenative (flying on a plane). Ends up the place that measured me didn't know what they were doing. It was my LE therapist that said they were too short for me. I was right on the cusp which means they should have gone up a size. They should have also noticed that the glove fingers were too short (pretty obvious by looking at my photo). They also gave me silicon top which was uncomfortable for me and not needed. I have smaller arms so I don't need the silicon. They just wanted to sell me what they had in stock. Even when I went back to exchange they fought me on the silicon issue. Why? because that's what they had in stock. They had to order me the long sleeve with out silicon. When I replaced them 6 months later I went to a different place. I don't purchase online because I use an \"in network\" place so my insurance will cover it.",

If he knew it was LCIS for sure then I doubt he would have done a SNB. We didn't do a biopsy because it would have delayed surgery. I was already waiting 11 weeks from original mammo/US! Also remember that my breasts were very dense, peri-menopausal, 49 and I had a grade 3 HER2+ tumor on the other side. I'm sure there were other factors that when added together my risk was high enough to recommend removal. If you are concerned I would discuss this with both your onc and BS.",

I have posted an image of my arms in the lymphedema section and one person couldn't even tell that I had it.The picture posted which mollyann linked to showed lymphedema that was out of control. How many women get it that bad? That picture would scare any person away if she though that the outcome was 49% would be looking like the woman in the picture. I got my lymphedema after my  4th chemo treatment. As far as survival I'm not sure if enough studies have been done. That's why standard care has not changed yet. These things tend to flip back and forth till enough studies have been done to be deemed conclusive. Yes Sereena should present this information to her BS. That's what I have been stating all along but she should go in with a close mind and say to her BS \"I'm not letting you do this because of this study.\"",

Bottom line is when the path came back negative in my nodes for mets I was happy. Actually my BS' nurse was so excited when she told me.

In my case the MRI showed nothing in my nodes but my BS was worried about micromets. I did some reading and there is like an 80% chance of mets in nodes if your tumor is 5cm or larger. For some reason I was very lucky and fell into the 20% area. I do have mild LE on the side that 10 nodes (level I) removed. I do feel I had a predisposition to it since my mom has it in her legs as well as her uncle. I know women who have had 25 nodes removed and no problem. The thing with LE is to catch it early. I would demand your BS send you to a PT so you can have your arm measured before surgery. That way if you do get LE they will know how bad. In my case I did not. I have very thin arms so they really didn't know how much is really swelled. We knew more once we got the swelling down. My other arm had SNB total of 4 nodes. No problem so far there. Aug 31st will be one year since my BMX. To be honest LE is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I caught it early. There is a recent study out saying that  AND might not be necessary but that is for small tumors (up to 2 inches in size) and no nodes with palpable issues. linky  and  linky  ",

Seriously I stopped crying then. There a lots of women that get chemo first. The good thing about that is they can see if the chemo is working. If it isn't then they can change to a different chemo. I didn't get chemo first so I will never know for sure if I was on the right chemo. HER2+ scared me so much at first but then I read about Herceptin and even other drugs that they have developed and are developing. This Herceptin is a game changer. It's not 100% but when it works its almost like being HER2- Lumpectomy vs mastectome (MX) is a very personal choice. I didn't have the choice because my tumor was so large and my breast so small. My other breast has suspicious stuff that would have had to be biopsied every year so my BS encouraged me to removed it. I actually wanted to anyway. It did end up being precancer (LCIS) so I do feel in my case I did the right thing. I have no regrets but do remember that getting an MX or BMX doesn't mean you dont' have any breast tissue. They can't get it all. For now on though they watch you very closely so they will catch any new or recurrences pretty early if that should ever occur. (((hugs))) it does get better.",

The lymph nodes are embedded in this fat, and can often feel just like the fat. Often the surgeon can't count all the lymph nodes at the time of surgery. For this reason, you probably won't know how many nodes were removed and how many of those were \"positive\" (involved in the cancer) until the pathologist analyzes the tissue. How many lymph nodes are removed depends just as much on your normal anatomy as it does on the surgeon's and pathologist's skill. Every woman has a different number of lymph nodes under her arm-some may only have five nodes and others may have over thirty.  source:  http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/lymph_node_removal/number_removed.jsp",

My surgeon said he thought I would need radiation (before surgery). The rad onc said I was in a grey area and felt that my treatment was so aggressive that she didn't feel there was a need to add further stress on my body with radiation. My surgeon wouldn't stage me before surgery but I asked him if there was a chance I would be a stage IIB. He really felt I would have a micro invasion in my nodes and be a stage IIIA\u2026 but he said you never know. I ended up being a \"you never know\" with no invasion. Like others have said things may change after surgery. The size can change or they find another tumor that wasn't picked up on the scans. A woman I know went in for a lumpectomy but the surgeon found a much larger tumor. Because he didn't have  her consent to do a mastectomy he had to close her up and do the mastectomy the following week.  --------------------------------------- I finished 6 rounds of chemo 3.5 weeks ago.  I was 49 premenopause (now 49+4 days) and chemopausal.

Some women can't handle the SE and stop after a few years. Since you are 100% positive the hormone therapy might be more important and a better gun then chemo.  Chemo tends to work better of high grade tumors. Yours is right in the middle. I wonder if you were grade 3 if these oncs would then recommend chemo?",

Put also note that chemo will also cause you to retain fluid. I don't have LE in my right arm but the upper arm does swell. My left arm had mild LE and it blew up last night after Tuesday's chemo. Better today especially since I had LE therapy today. Bottom line, get it checked out by an LE specialist. If it's LE and they treat it early this will be better managed for you.",

A lot of what you read online is old information. Herceptin has only been standard care for early stage for about 5+ years. I had genetic testing too although no history in my family. There is an increased risk of having the gene in certain cultures (one of which I fall into). I also have a sister, brother, 1 nephew and 3 nieces so I felt it important to find out.

He said it was for larger tumors but I know there was another gal that had the same size tumor and she got chemo first. There are pros and cons to both. I think if you are node negative and get chemo first they may not know if it's in your nodes. In some cases they may do a sentinel first but then you end up doing 2 surgeries. I think in my case my BS really thought I would have micromets. Probably the reason why he took out the level 1 nodes without doing a SN biopsy. If I did have micromets and did chemo we might have never know for sure. (I also think that getting those 10 nodes out and seeing they were clear got me a pass on rads even though I was in a gray area). Now one of the good things about getting chemo first is they can tell if it works. Am I concerned that maybe the chemo I got might not have worked\u2026 no because statistically what I got does work most of the time. Also there was a 40% chance I might not even needed the chemo.  My point here is there is more than one correct way to skin a cat. I would ask your onc about it though.

By Thursday afternoon I wanted to go home. I did that evening. They would have let me stay longer but I was so glad to leave. ----------------------------------------------- Hospitals are breeding grounds for infection. You don't want to stay there any long than needed. Also they poke and prod you every 3 hours. You can't get any sleep there. Your mom is much better out of the hospital. (Also the food was the worst). If your mother is having trouble dealing with the loss of her breast her BS should be able to recommend a social worker or other professional for her to see. All women are different. I never felt the loss and I had both removed. I was actually relieved after surgery knowing that the cancer was gone and not spreading. -----------------------------------------------   As far as doctors getting a high pay. Yes and I feel they deserve it. They work hard long hours. When my PS is in his office seeing patients he is there from 7:30 till 7 or longer. I have no idea what he does on surgery days but he was working on me till 8-8:30 in the evening. My brother in law is a physician. My husband is 4.5 years older than him. Every time we meet a new doctor they ask my husband who is older. He say his brother (my husband is a very funny man). Thing is my husband does look younger even though his brother has more hair.  In general I find doctors look much older than they really are. I'm sure it has to do with all the long hours.",

Bok Choy This type of Chinese cabbage contains brassinin; a powerful cancer-fighter, also found in broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Bok Choy should be eaten 3 times a week, in 1/2 cup servings to obtain its full benefits. 2. Cooked Tomatoes have more cancer-fighting properties than raw tomatoes. Both contain the molecule lycopene, but heating the tomato changes its chemical structure and makes the benefits more readily available to your body. You should eat 2-3 (1/2 cup) servings of cooked tomatoes a week. 3. Flounder This fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and low in mercury. Three 6-ounce servings a week is ideal. 4. Strawberries The antioxidants in this berry help fight cancers. You should eat 1 cup a day, including the juice. 5. Artichokes contain 3 different cancer-fighting molecules. Enjoy ¼ cup of hearts per day. --------------------------------- Dr Oz also says whole soy is good. Lots of controversy over that but there is another thread discussing soy here on BC.org: Whole Soy Foods (Serving size: 1-2 servings a day) When you're shopping, look for whole soy foods over isolated soy protein powders like fake meats with soy isolate. Try eating tofu, tempeh, soy milk, edamame and soy nuts. They're good sources of protein and help guard against hormonally driven cancers, such as prostate cancer and breast cancer.",
