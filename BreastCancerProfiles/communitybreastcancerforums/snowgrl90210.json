The ultrasound had a 4mm*5mm hypoecholic lump with well defined border and oval/elliptical shape in the right breast. It was an incidental discovery as I never felt any lump or pain there except for my regular monthly breast tenderness elsewhere. Doctor mentioned its a fibroadenoma and not to worry. I wanted to get an fnac test done but the doctor mentioned it\u2019s too small a growth to do anything and it\u2019s better to check the status after 6 months. She suggested an ultrasound guided fnac as I am too anxious but chances of picking up cells in this case is minuscule . What do you all suggest?
