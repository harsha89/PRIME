My fabulous oncologist told me today that the Achilles problems definitely are not caused by the chemo or Arimidex, but now after reading these posts and others on the internet I'm wondering if he is fully informed about this.  He's still fabulous but I'm going to have to advocate for myself. Thank you to all who have posted on this topic - your stories have really helped.  I hope that you have found relief from your Achilles problems and other symptoms. tcat",
