I guess ea dose is a bit stronger than traditional to make up for the shorter time span. I read alot about this shorter treatment and studies point to good outcome, so I requested this from my oncs.  They agreed I was a good candidate. Hope I won't start second-guessing my decision later. I figure all you can do, is learn as much as you can and make the decisions that work best for you.",

Good luck with your catheter Susan. I was so hoping to do that tx but didn't work for me. I had the Contura inserted for about 5 days and then had it removed w/o a single treatment. Just wouldn't fit my cavity. Bummer. I also heard about the Sharpies ruining bras. I think I'll just wear my $5.99 sports bra for awhile.  Plus, all my other bras have an underwire and that's just been too uncomfortable. Good luck all! - Karen",

If I do wear an underwire, I've been stuffing part of one of those soft surgical pads they sent home with me to help pad the wire area. Lump, SNB and balloon catheter incision sites are all still a bit sore and I'm also having that pulling feeling on underside of my arm which I guess is the SNB. Its gotten stiffer to move lately.  I think more stretching will help too. I've also found gently massaging my breast helps. I've got a hard knot of scar tissue at the lump site as well. Are y'all still having numbness around your lump scars?  I asked my rad onc about that today and he says for about 20-25% women that never entirely heals but for most it will heal in 4-7 months or so. YIKES. That sucks KAK - sorry to hear about your \"slab-ectomy\". Funny name for it, not so funny results.  Good luck.",

I know it will be fine and I'll feel much better after its over and done and behind me. Was using Arimidex for awhile but just hated it and stopped for now, but when I meet with my onc later this month, maybe I'll try it again. What a journey this bc crap takes us on huh? I had rads on left breast and it still feels so odd, dense and sorta numb, after almost a whole year. Does that ever go away entirely?
