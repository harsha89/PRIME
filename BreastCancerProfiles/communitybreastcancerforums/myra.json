(Had negative SNB...no lymphatic invasion detected). I just had a routine 6 month follow up with rad onc, and she noticed swelling above my left (ipsilateral) clavical, and ordered a CT scan of the area. When I asked what she was looking for, she implied that I MIGHT have mets in the lymph nodes in this area. (Info on the web indicates that \"supraclavicular lymph node mets\" could mean you have a Stage IIIc recurrance!!! So now I'm scared witless!) Of course the swelling could be from any number of other causes -- RIGHT? It feels soft and \"puffy\" like edema or fatty tissue to me... Anyone have this before, and can you tell me something less frightening that it might be?! Myra Kia Orana (Live long!) Dx 1/3/2005, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It does seem that we have similar symptoms, and knowing that so many doctors have examined you and are not concerned is very reassuring to me! I also suspect that it may be lymph fluid \"pooling\" even though I've never had arm lymphadema... I should get an appt for the CT tomorrow, and will let you know the results. Thanks again for replying -- it really helps!",
