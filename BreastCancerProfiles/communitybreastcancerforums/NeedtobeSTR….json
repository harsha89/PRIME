Never thought of the what ifs before....and now that I do, I am thinking about the What I have and what I am doing now!

My 4 year old is mad at Daddy for making mommy look like a boy. lol  And my 7 year old thinks I look better than her bald Daddy.  I feel so much better not feeling hair everywhere. Got my wig and a cute hat with hair to put on in a rush.  What did everyone use to wash their scalp?  I was thinkning baby shampoo. ",

But I think I needed to take this leap to start and heal and move foward. I am still scared but I am not letting that stop me. I have always wanted to be a nurse and after this year I am determined to be the best one I can be. I was lucky to have wonderful nurses while I was going through every stage of this ordeal that I hope I can touch just one person and even inspire just one person the way some have inspired me. Funny thing as I layed in my hospital bed my first day after my double masectomy feeling down and depressed I had a nursing student come in who was taking care of me for the day. She was older than me and we began talking. She was in her last semester and she was going o graduate from the same school as me. I was so upset thinking damm I just graduated and look at me now. I was so jealous of her going to be moving on. Then she told me that she was a 20 year survivor and even showed me her reconstructed breasts. She decided to go into nursing to pay it foward. I started crying, she started crying and I told her she just did 1,000 times. I think god sent her to me that day. I will always remember her and I know one day I want to be able to do that for someone else. So even though this is not the best job meaning a hospital job I am taking it. I need to and want to be that person one day who makes someone else believe they can make it and move on. Not letting this fear run my life anymore. ( okay it will always be ther haha who am I kidding.. But....I am not going to let it take over. Thank you all so much again! It feels so good to come on hear and vent and have so much support from people who understand and get it!",
