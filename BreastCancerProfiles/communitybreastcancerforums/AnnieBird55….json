This study is not so much that stress caused my initial cancer, but, that stress may be related to recurrence, or on the other hand, a lack of stress may prolong or eliminate recurrence. The study will span 5 years. I see a researcher every 3 months where I answer a LOT of questions (stress-related). Blood tests are also done measuring cortisol (stress hormone?) and oxytocin (the feel-good hormone). -Anne  ",

I agree with Kathy - too much activity can cause a lot of fluid to drain. Another thought: Try Ice ...(of course, if it is OK with your doctor). -Anen",

Since my bilat mast (4/16/07), I have two other surgeries (exchange and nipple recon). My last surgery was relatively a cake walk in that the anxiety was not there at all.But before the Mast I was sweating and shaking so much pre-op that I thought I was never going to come out of my general anesthesia (die). I had to use the restroom about every 15 minutes (dragging the IV and lovely hospital gown open in back...ulghh..). When the anesthesiologist came in, I ASKED for something in the IV, and within a few minutes he gave me something to calm down (===> so, don't be afraid to ask...!). Post-op, my biggest discomfort was the inability to pee and my bladder was loaded. It was a matter of my not being able to relax. drain were somewhat awkward (I do not think they are a big deal). You will need to adjust with not being able to raise your elbows much higher than shoulder level (for a while). So, think about that today and tomorrow as you arrange things around the home; bring anything down from top shelves. I looked the surgery more as \"Losing my breasts\" rather than \"I'll be removing all my cancer\", and I think it would have helped had I looked at it the 2nd way. I am praying for a speedy recovery for you both and b9 path results. Like Maria said, you will be relieved that you have passed through this phase. -Anne",

I was also just plain terrified of surgery and anesthesia. Yes, I cried a lot, and sometimes I still do. There is grieving involved with this. I think it is great you are looking for a support group, and, that you found this site! So, you are indeed on your way to conquer the fear. Reconstruction is gradual, so, you are sort of always on the road to improving. Not that it will be just like what you had, but, reconstructed breasts really do look pretty good. And, the Nipple recon really put a smile on my face because that part just made them look normal (not like round mounds). You know, sexually, it is mostly about how *you* feel about how you look. I think my foobs look great. Be positive that you will get there too. Also, be patient and loving with yourself and know it is ok to cry. And when you want to vent, or cry and be heard, you know we are here. The chat rooms here are great for those times in the middle of the night when you need to laugh, cry, screem, or hang out. Wishing you luck on the 23rd. You can do it1 Annie  ",

I had a discharge at the time I had my diagnostic Mammo (the discharge was brown). Later I was told this can happen with \"necrosis\" (dying cells in the ducts). Necrosis may occur with or without BC. It is a good thing that these \"signs\" stimulate us to go further pursue our Mammograms; whereas some of us may put it off. I am speaking about myself here!! Try not to worry, but do the right thing to check this out with your doctor. -Anne",

I will say that for probably 5 months after my bilat mast I had pain and tightness in the chest. I was going through expansion, and the expansion process does give pain (usually just a few days after the fill). But I had intermittent twangs and pains pretty much most of the time that I am sure was unrelated to expansion. But ...when my fills were done ...my ps had me wait a few months (just to be sure I did not want anything bigger ). It was during this time the pain just went away. I think it was because we were leaving the area alone. It had time to just settle in and heal. I hope those knots subside... -Anne",

In the last 4 years, I probably have gone through 8 procedures. I had my original bilat mast in '07. The expander procedure was painful, but inside I was always hoping that the exchange would yeild a freedom from pain and discomfort. WRONG! Hematomas (that did not go away). Staph infections. Capsular Contarction. On both sides. Nerve damage down both arms. Physical therapy. I now have one implant left (which lost most of its saline) which has slid over into the armpit and I look like a freak. Clothing is a huge challenge. I buy a pretty sweater, take it home, get it on for work, and notice my lopsided fram and I tear off the sweater. I am too ashamed to go back to my PS to have the remaining single implant (which is in my armit) removed. Today I would not mind being totally flat ...at least clothing challenges woudl be minimal. I used to post on the recon boards years ago when I was going through expansion and nipple recon. However, I could not do it any more because I felt my words and experience could no longer be encouraging. I did come back to find this thread where others have express they have had it and throe in the towel regrading recon. I often wonder why I got here ....why I started the recon anyway. I recall a lot of talk about the mastectomy experience is earier to deal with emotionally when one has the expanders in right away. In hindsight I wish I had never gone through recon because failing recon is worse thanjust dealing with losing breasts. Now I have two failures.... let alone fighting the disease. Anne",
