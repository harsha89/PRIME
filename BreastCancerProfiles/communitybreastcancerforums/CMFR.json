This is a direct quote from my mother in law when I sent her an email telling her how upset and stressed my husband is: \"I knew he was upset by the tone of his voice. You two will be just fine through this.\" She's a nurse. Hello, we aren't just fine. We are completely freaked. How about a little support here? This is your son going through a crisis.",

My rads onc and surgeon don't know what it is. I have tried Jean's Cream, aloe, vitamin E, Aquafor, and hydrocortisone... The surgeon said let's see what happens but it doesn't look like cancer and he will biopsy it if I still have it when I see him next.",

However I have started a blog that I plan on using to keep everyone posted on my progress. I have lots of distant friends and relatives and don't want to be on the phone all the time. I also want my parents to take their annual vacation - they are elderly and may not be able to for many more years - and they have a laptop and will be able to follow my progress from a distance as well.",
