I know this is very unusual, every dr. I have met says \"oh, you are the one\", we've never heard of this before.  Because it is so unusual had three path reports, different locations, all confirmed breast cancer.  However at this time still can't find a site except for my neck.  Thanks, Log in to post a reply",
