Thank you all for being so willing to share your experiences and support. This is a sort of long story, so hopefully it doesn't turn into a book. Over the summer, I met with a surgeon to pursue vertical sleeve gastrectomy (weight loss surgery). One of the first papers they handed me in the office was a breast cancer screening to see if i was a candidate for genetic testing. Long story short, I found out that I don't carry any of the genetic mutations that Myriad tests for, but because of family history it was determined that I have increased risk of breast cancer. It was recommended that I have yearly MRIs starting this year. My dad's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer twice. My dad's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at about age 45-ish and with either ovarian or cervical cancer about a year ago (I'm not very close with that side of the family, so I don't really know). I had my MRI on the 10th of this month. The MRI showed what the radiologist called a \"band of tissue\" in my left breast that extends from my nipple to the back of my breast. It basically looks like a nodule near the \"back\" of my breast started sprouting stuff, too a sharp right, and headed straight for my nipple. I am having pain in one spot on my left breast, but there are no discernible lumps. Today I had an ultrasound and a mammogram. I'm unclear about whether or not anything was shown on the mammogram, but he said that nothing showed up on the ultrasound. I plan to pick up the reports and images on Thursday. I have no idea what my BIRADs score is. Honestly, I was just kind of overwhelmed and my brain completely failed me in the moment. I'm to have an MRI guided biopsy after I start my next cycle, which I'm not expecting until sometime around the first of February. The MRI likely won't be until late the following week sometime, and they said that the pathology reports typically take up to three business days. I was ok with all of this until the ride home from the hospital. I was in the car alone with my thoughts, and even though I was trying not to freak out...I was freaking out. I'll post more information here when I get it on Thursday...or I might just get impatient and make the trek tomorrow. I haven't decided yet. Does anyone have any idea what to make of this? Similar stories? Advice? Again, thank you all so much for your time. Log in to post a reply",
