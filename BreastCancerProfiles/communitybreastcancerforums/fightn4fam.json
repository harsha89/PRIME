I can't wait until this is all a bad memory.  I pray for all the girls here every night as well as for myself.  Hope everyone's managing ok.  I have taken my cancer and turned my tears into jokes.  It keeps me going.  But I only make jokes of my cancer and my situations.  Just to lighten the air around me.  My hubby calls me the Cancer Comedian.  There is nothing funny about cancer, so please don't get this wrong... but I make fun of my situations that I have experienced and take songs and change the lyrics to fit me.  For example, I took the Chicago song \"If you leave me now\" and sang it as my hair fell off in chunks as I washed and combed it, with tears strollin' down my face.  My hubby says, I have a good attitude.  I call it tears of a clown.  The jokes helps everyone around me cope, including me.  Again, I joke about me and my situation and would never joke about anyone else.    ",
