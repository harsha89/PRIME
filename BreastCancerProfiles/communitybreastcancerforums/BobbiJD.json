    "Content": "BobbiJD wrote: My mother was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in 2011. The cancer has not yet reached her bones. She was on hormonal treatments until May, 2015, because she then was diagnosed with uterine cancer and had to undergo radiation. Radiation was completed at the end of June and her last appointment with the uterine oncologist said everything there looked good. Her breast cancer doctor stated before the uterine cancer that my mother would have to take IV chemo because the pills were no longer working. Her appointment is this Friday but unfortunately last week she was admitted to the hospital because she could not breathe. They gave her oxygen to take home but that did not seem to work. The emergency room doctors said there is nothing they can do for her. My question is whether chemo at this point is an option and whether it would make it easier for her to breathe. She had the tube placed into her lung on April, 2015, and has to have it drained twice per week. She was coping with that but now that is not even working. She is 82 and in otherwise good health. Since the radiation she has been weak and dizzy. Her oncologist said the chemo may or may not work for the breathing. Just wanted some insight from any survivors to help my mom make the decision whether or not chemo is worth it at this point. H Log in to post a reply",
