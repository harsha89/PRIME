      "Content": "Jul 23, 2015 10:30AM - edited Jul 23, 2015 10:32AM by Cantbelievethis Thank you all for your replies. To 282go, thank you for your concern, but I actually was not posting because I am in doubt about the decision, just for support and to find out other people's experiences. I hate the decision, but I do in my gut feel it's the right one. If I had a very small stage one tumor such as yourself, I likely would not be considering chemo. But even though there was no lymph node involvement and no LVI, the size of the tumor gave more opportunity for some undetectable cells to have escaped. I'm doing the chemo to maximize my chances of a long and healthy life. It's good to hear that running is still a possibility. i'm not really a runner by the way, more like a jogger, 2 miles a day is about my max. I'd like to try to keep it up through chemo if I can, and increase it afterwards. Maybe try to run a 5K or even work up to a 10K when all this is done. ",
