My rads ended right before Christmas and they gave me the mask to take home thought that was a bit bizarre but brought it home anyway). With my sick sense of cancer humor, I placed  on the Christmas tree as a tree topper!  My DH rolled his eyes and gave me a disapproving look (jeez it was only a temporary thing), my teenage boys laughed and told me I was a psycho (my youngest asked if he could wear it for Halloween next year) and my 125lb. lab would not stop barking at it. Two weeks after my rads ended I began pulling clumps of hair out, this I was not expecting, From research I had done, I was led to believe I may only lose my eyelashes on the eye that was being treate. Guess I didn't realize the beams were going through the top of my head. Anyhow aside from the the crappy news post, I just wanted to let you know your posts always make me smile; you've got a great sense of humor & positive attitude. Oh, and a couple months back when I posted about my breast surgeon trying to talk me out of the DIEP recon. because at this stage I should be \"living life with zest\", you told me going through with my recon plans is living life with zest. Hope you don't mind, but that is exactly what I told my bs when she asked once again if I had changed my mind. I am scheduled for surgery this coming Tuesday, thanks Elizabeth! Sending positive thoughts and have fingers & toes crossed for good scan results, Linnette",

The following is my response to the author of the article and a link to its web site. Dear Michelle,      I know that intentions are good, but in regard to the title of this article, I feel I need to speak on behalf of the women with breast cancer whose voices and stories are rarely heard. These women, me included, have Stage IV/metastatic breast cancer and there is nothing \"rosy\" about it.      While we know the importance of awareness and early detection, as well as the uncountable lives that the color pink and its campaigns have touched, those of us with metastatic breast cancer often feel very isolated, given up on, and even hidden behind the pink ribbon. We can not contribute to the survivor stories with happy endings. We are not survivors, we are warriors.       We fight tirelessly for more time with loved ones, but know that with every new treatment we try; hoping it is one that works, it is one less in our arsenal. Eventually we will have exhausted all of our options and the battle will be lost.       Last October House Resolution Bill 787 was passed but I doubt most people in our nation know that the bill designates October 13th as National Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. There is a lack of knowledge and many misconceptions about Stage IV breast cancer. The bottom line is there is no Stage V.  Those of us fighting desperately against a disease that will ultimately claim our lives do not want to be warriors, we want to be survivors. We want to be cured!!!       It is time to take off the \"rose\" colored glasses. With less than 1% of breast cancer research funding spent on metastatic research (i.e. possible live saving treatments), we don't have a fighting chance. Sincerely, Warrior Linnette Stefan       ",

I have to keep telling myself not to over due it and to take advantage of the situation.  Just hang out on the couch, get reacquainted with the remote, and let those around me spoil me (that's a difficult one for me).  I have been good, and will be continue to be, but I am just sooooo happy my recovery is going to be nothing like I had anticipated! Oh, and I forgot in my original post to share with you that late afternoon the day before surgery, my ps called and told he had broken his arm!?!?!? He was cycling and fell off his bike!!!!  I'm lucky I didn't total my car when I answered that call! I had to choose whether I would wait and have him and his associate do it when he was back in business, or have two other surgeons from the team complete the procedure. My decision wasn't difficult, all of the surgeons on my team  were also on the team that performed the first partial face transplant in the U.S.  It was performed on the woman who was attacked by her neighbors/friends pet chimp. I was in good hands! RobinWendy, was your recon the DIEP also? Regardless of the type, both of ours were crazy long! My poor dh was the only one left in the surgical building after 11:00 pm.; there wasn't even have a staff person to update him on what was going on.  He wasn't alone for very long, apparently the cleaning crew eventually came in with their mops & buckets   Thanks again for all your words of encouragement and well wishes!
