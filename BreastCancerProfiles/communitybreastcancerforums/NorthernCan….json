Aside from the precautionary lumpectomy, it was not taken very seriously. Now here I am, less than 1.5 years later with 3 tumours in my right breast. One of them wasn't even discovered until the pathology of the lumps removed. They had a really hard time with the smaller lump as well because I have so many cysts. It's hard for them to see past. Get the biopsy and make sure to stay on top of your mammograms.",

But then somehow my case was put before a board of some kind and they said do the lumpectomy. I would definitely have the biopsy after my experience. Also, you might want to do the test on the following website twice: Once including ADH and once without and compare results. It's informative. https://www.mycanceriq.ca/ Good luck!",

I'm new here.  Just so you know, I'm dragging my heels a bit about being here, but must face reality.  I was diagnosed on Jan 13th, 2014 with multi-focal ADH and had my lumpectomy on Feb 18th.  So quick!  It could have been faster as I was given the option of getting it done in a hurry with a Dr that didn't communicate much, or wait for the one that did.  Well, I'm not sure this one truly communicated, but he was definitely entertaining! Anyway, I have done a lot of reading about ADH and the high risk is scary.  I can understand why so many are opting for double mastectomies.",
