So far it has definitely been one of the easier ones compared to others she has been on (Havalen, taxol, & xeloda)... she has some nausea and vomiting but pain is down, energy is up as well as appetite. She was losing weight constantly for a while there before gemzar. I think it was mostly due to no appetite/ lots of vomiting. But now she has been stable since starting Gemzar. Im hoping she stays with \"stable boy\" for a long while!!! Its good to see her feeling better now! Oh and her hair is continuing to grow and has not fallen out! Which is a plus! So if you do Gemzar, I hope its as nice to you as it has been to my mom! Good luck  -Laura",

Side effects were tolerable just nausea every once in a while and hair loss. Then about late August she started complaining about her left hip. (she had a right hip replacement in may) well drs put her on stronger pain meds (fentanyl patch) and in sept re did her scans and showed that the cancer had stabilized but that the left hip was very unstable and that they needed to do another hip replacement. She couldn't stand the pain anymore so on nov 1st she had it done. The drs stopped the chemo till after she recovered. Her oncologist said that her scans showed that cancer was still only in her bones but that some places showed it was getting better and other places showed it was a little worse. So he decided to switch her to xeloda. We started that on nov 14. She didn't get out of the hosp till sat the 19. She was good to go home and was recovering really well to her surgery. Much better than the other hip replacement. She actually doesn't have any more pain in her hips! But then Sunday at home, she couldn't stop throwing up and began to feel a big bulge in her stomach. Her stomach was giving her a lot of pain and her anxiety was horrible.. She couldn't sit still and much less sleep! I called the on all dr and he said to stop xeloda and to only give her two pills in the morning and two at night. She was having four in the morning and three a night. We tried that for monday but her stomach pain didn't stop... We brought her to the ER yesterday and they did a ct scan which showed she had an inflammed large intestine. They weren't sure if it was an infection since this was the only symptom she had. All her blood work was normal. She would cramp up every 8 minutes or so with really bad pain. The gave her antibiotics and today she seems to be doing better.... I want to know if any of you have tried this medicine and if t has worked for u or if any of u have had something similar to this happen.

It was such hard thing to think about but now I realize that this is something we should take care of sooner rather than later. Sounds like this DNR issue is a pretty common conversation to have at some point.  I want to talk to mom about it but I want her to get out of the hospital before coming up with a plan. Cookie97, I didnt think we were on that river but your right... having that conversation was a big wake up call! I dont know how to bring it up to mom tho without making her think that the end is near. I dont know how to talk about it and fill out those papers without making her think that I think shes dying or something. K-Lo - Youre right... thats exactly what our ONC said. that it would be an \"injustice\" to do that to a patient after such a tough fight with this monster. Sheila I appreciate everything you told me. I listened to every bit of it. No one has ever told me the things you have written to me and I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I pray every night to God that mom gets her health back and that she gets on a good treatment that will give her more time with us with no pain! And you are right. It does help me a whole lot! My mom prays a rosary every night and I have a strong belief that this helps her more than anything! She has a great relationship with my father and they both are very religious as well! They have also been together 38 years (this July). Sometimes it is hard for me to be the one in this role, sometimes I feel like they look to me for hope. After receiving bad news they both look to me to see the expression on my face to see whether they should freak out or not. At least thats how I feel about it! They hear bad news sometimes and I always do my best to make them realize that they are not alone, that others have gotten thru times like these and have been able to survive them. I always share stories that I find on these boards and do whatever I can to help them see that this is a tough battle but there is hope! And there are many others who are fighting the very same thing every day!! I feel like sometimes I have to be the tough one that holds her up. But when I hear bad news it scares me and I dont know what to do to not transmit that fear to her. I have always told her everything that the doctors tell me so she is very aware of what is going on with her and her disease. I have not and dont plan on ever keeping anything from her. We have had that conversation and she has always told me she wants to know EVERYTHING. So far she has been very involved with everything thats going on. So although sometimes its hard I still manage to be very open with her about results and things like that. I guess thats the hard part but with prayer, your right, things are a bit easier. Let go and let God huh?? You amaze me with your strength.. Just out of your craniotomy and you have the strength to still lift others from difficult times! I admire that like you cant even imagine! Its great to hear that your tumor was non-malignant! I pray for you and your good health! :) Like I said thanks to everyone for your input. It really got me out of that low that I fell to after talking with the ONC. So the update on mom is that we went ahead and did a PET scan on Tuesday and received the results yesterday. Looks like there is slight progression in her bones compared to the last PET scan done in October. This is still a bone only disease. There is one lymph node that shows that it is bigger this time. It use to be 2cm and now 7cm not sure why. The plan is to switch her chemo from the Havalen (Eribulin) to Gemzar now. we are due to start next thursday. Which is the schedule we use to have. She is to get that once a week for two weeks then one week off. She is also supposed to be getting zometa every three weeks now instead of every four. To help with the calcium.  She is being discharged from the hospital today and being admitted into rehab for a week. This should help her regain her strength back because it seems that she lost all the gain that she had made after rehabilitating from her hip replacements. Hopefully this rehab can get her back to where she was. Out of the walker and at least to a cane. How I wish she could eventually get out of the cane too!!! I miss that so much!! But trust me as long as she is up and walking without pain that would be great!! She says she misses being able to get around better and not have to drag that walker everywhere! Hopefully this will be good for her. Her mental status is a lot better now, the dr believes that it was due to the calcium being elevated. The calcium is now at 10.3 so we are getting better. Dr. thinks her next dose of zometa will help with that. Gemzar he said has a side effect of lowering blood counts putting her at a higher risk of infection. We experienced this with Havalen and she had a total of 4 UTIs while she was on it! Now she is on a daily maintenance antibiotic (macrodaunton) that will help prevent UTIs. . This sounds like a good plan, now we just have to pray that it works!!",

The dr thinks she just got whatever my sister had. Which is the common cold. My mom was having some confusion and a lot of weakness in her legs, dr said that was normal for her since she is 65. What got me was that they said that if her blood turns out clear that then it prob just is the cold. And if so, they can't really treat it with anything?! That they will just let it run it's course. My question is how is she supposed to fight off the cold on her own if she has no defenses?! Her ANC was 280. Is that pretty low?",

She still has the cant sit still very long thing as well as all day yesterday and the day before she couldn't stop crying... They finally started her lexapro back on yesterday. She was off of it for three days. I'm not sure if that had something to do with it. But later in the afternoon yesterday and this morning it seems that she's doing better. No more crying. Dr still has to come see us today about changing her from IV antibiotics to pill form. They said that the inflammed large intestine was very likely an effect of xeloda. Im not sure if the dr would like to try a smaller dose or just switch her to a whole other chemo. I'm glad t see she's no longer in pain! That's a blessing!",

      "Content": "monroy01 wrote: So my mom who was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer with mets to the bone in Jan 2011 is back in the hospital. This past year has had its ups and downs. She started at a weight of 192 and is now at 149. So far she has had about 8-9 visits to the hospital. Twice for hip replacements (both have been down now).. and about 3-4 for UTIs that cause confusion/altered mental status/ extreme weakness. And today she is in for hypercalcemia. This is the second time that she is in for this reason. The last time was last July and her calcium levels were at 15.6 when we got to the hosp. This time we got her here at 12.5 I believe we have gotten better about noticing signs and reacting right away. I believe in the past since we were so new at this we would just attribute her signs to \"maybe its the chemo\"... but not anymore. We bring her in any time shes showing signs. Her oncologist explained to me that her zometa is supposed to help her and that they only like to use that once a month. He set us up with a kidney specialist and were supposed to get a shot of Calcitonin. But when they checked her calcium levels again they were at 11.7 so they decided that flushing her with fluids was gonna do the trick. Her mental status is better now i think. She hasnt said anything odd. When we brought her to the hospital, her symptoms were extreme weakness, so bad that she seemed she was paralyzed from the waist down. It was scary. and she kept seeing things and saying things that didnt make sense. That was on sunday. today she is better, she can walk a little on the walker and doesnt seem confused anymore. She is getting a pet scan right now. She just had one at the end of feb but because of her CA27.29 levels which were constantly going down until about early feb they started back up. She has been on Havalen since December, her markers started around 415. they kept going down and in early feb they were down to 180. then Feb 24 they went up to 260 and then March 24 they went down slightly to 253. So her oncologist decided to do a pet scan and see whats going on. she was able to use the cane all thru feb and then in march she started getting worse and now has to use the walker. He suspects its time to change chemos. I am always afraid of that because you never know if the next one is going to work or not! Havalen is her 3rd chemo. How many options does she really have? I notice on these boards a lot of different chemos that I havent heard of so it seems like we have lots of options! I am hoping I am right. So far she has been on Taxol which worked for about 4 months as well... we were taken off of that because her scans didnt show it was getting better... only the same. so we switched to xeloda but she got a very painful inflammed bowel and so they werent sure if it was the xeloda that caused it so we switched again and now are on havalen. Today I spoke with the dr outside of moms room and he told me hes been wanting to talk to me. He gave me the conversation about have we talked to mom about what to do if something happens. he explained that he isnt giving up on us and doesnt suspect that something is going to happen during this hospital stay but that we need to be prepared. that all stage iv cancer patients eventually come to a point where the dr cant do anything to stop it. that if i know that moms cancer is pretty much all over her bones. he showed me her lab report and explained some things to me. He seemed to stress the part where the electrolytes are important too.. theyre important for your heart. he said what he doesnt want is for something to happen to mom and for us to try and resusitate her and her end up in icu where most patients dont make it out of. To talk to mom and ask where she would like to be if she were to die. in the hospital plgged up  to needles and tubes or at home with her family. he explained how in the system they still have her set up as \"full code\" which is where they do EVERYTHING to keep her alive and that sometimes he thinks thats an injustice to his patients... that he wants what ever the patient want and most patients say they would like to be home.. (which i know my mom would too)... but that if she is still considered \"full code\" that that wont happen... so we need to talk to her about changing that \"full code\" to \"DNR\" do not resusitate... dont get me wrong we love our oncologist and am pretty sure he just needs to say this.. but im not sure why its hitting me so hard! I mean is this really it... is mom going to leave soon... what about all you ladies who have lived more than 1 year with this thing... why cant i find that strength right now... how can i find it. I am the one that needs to be strong for my mom and dad... i cant stand feeling the way i do right now. Moms cancer is still only in her bones...they just did a chest ct scan on sunday and a head ct and both came back clear... we are hoping that the pet scan still shows its only in the bones...we will find out tomorrow...but in the mean time... i cant stop thinking about what the oncologist said to me this morning!
