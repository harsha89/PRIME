My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 60.  She had ductal first then five years later she developed glandular breast cancer in the other breast, then she developed inflammatory breast cancer.  She passed away just before her 72 birthday.  My first cousin (my maternal grandmother's other grandaughter) developed ductal breast cancer at age 30.  She had a mastectomy, chemo, and radiation.  She developed brain and bone mets at age 35.  She had two tumors in her brain one was surgicaly removed the other treated with radiation due to its location.  She has been recieving monthly treatments for the bone mets for the past 5 years.  She is now 40 and has been diagnosed with more mets in her brain and right lung.  She is BRCA 2 positive. Now on to me I began having pain in my left breast about 7 months ago.  In January of this year I had a diagnostic mammo done with ultra sound.  Everything came back normal.  My doctor said to let her know if the pain didn't go away or got worse.  The pain didn't go away but I didn't think much of it since the tests were negative for anything suspicious.  Within the past month the pain began to get worse waking me up at night when I rolled onto my  left side.  So I called my PCP and she decided to send me to a breast surgeon.  The breast surgeon was unable to manually feel any lump or bump.  Because of my family history and my persistance she decided to have me get a breast MRI, (I had a risk assesment of 38%, needed 20% to have insurance cover it).  I had the breast MRI 8/13/13.  Results-Within the left breast, at 3.7 cm from the nipple and at approximately 12 o'clock, there is a round homogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders superiorly and anteriorly.  This mass measures 5.2mm in maximal dimension.  The mass overall demonstrates heterogenous kinetics with wash-out kinetics (type III), anteriorly.  I had a needle biopsy yesterday under ultrasound.  I won't have a answer until Monday at the earliest Tuesday at the latest.  I can't stop thinking about it and I just want to know now!  I haven't slept good since I got the results of this MRI.  I just have this gut feeling I have cancer. What are the chances I don't have cancer? Log in to post a reply",
