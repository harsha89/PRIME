Part of my incision was opening up so he put glue back on it today. And that was before the fill! Now I'm in so much pain. There is a burning pain when I breathe, like a take your breath away pain. :o",

They said some do feel intense pain with the fills and it can be as bad as the day after mx pain (which I swear it is!). I have a pretty high pain tolence. Anyhow, I'm going to wait 24 hrs and see what it's like. I had my first fill two weeks after surgery (15 days). First fill was only 30 cvs or so I think. The week after they tried to do 99 but I could only handle 80. This week they did 80but the pain is so much worse. The final fill will be next week.",

Here's my question...have any of you had a post chemo rash that started up a month or two AFTER finishing chemo? I would say that it started up for me 3 or 4 weeks ago (so about 5 weeks after chemo ended). It's not itchy. It's on my arms and back (very small bumps, some are a little red) and on my face (cheeks and jaw line, slightly more red). Is this normal? I called my MOs nurse and she said she didn't know and to call my PCP :o( I don't think my PCP knows I even have cancer! Thank you!",

Her thinking is that it's not always easy to scrub off in the shower and it can create an extra layer for the beams to get through, making radiation less effective. Is there anyone on this board that had this restriction? How did your skin hold up? Thank you!",

Seemed easy compared to mastectomy and diepðŸ¤ª For the lung nodule, they are leaning towards a resectioning/surgically removing the lung nodule but is waiting for the foundation one report from the brain tissue. Their concern is that if it doesn't come back pdl1 positive (initial tumor 3 years ago was not) there wont be an effective chemo or immunotherapy options because my initial tumor didn't respond to systemic treatment dr juric called me tonight hes leaning towards a resectioning/surgically removing the lung nodule but is waiting for the foundation of ne report. his concern is that if it doesn't come back pdl1 positive like last time, there wont be an effective chemo or immunotherapy options. hes a bit stumped because the blood biopsy showed next to nothing for a tumor burden- the cancer cells dont seem to be shedding which is odd. he said in most chemo non-responsive tnbc cases it comes back fast (within a year) and all over. mine was almost 3 years out and only appears to be these two spots. thats not something he typically sees go figure im stumping the team but he also said perhaps the vaccine tpiv-200 trial i was in - until this progression- is/was slowing progression his main point was that i really need the pdl1 to come back postitive to have effective systemic options im nervous its going to come back negative agai",
