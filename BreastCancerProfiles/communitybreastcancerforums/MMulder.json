He is a true expert.  He truly knows about DCIS!  He recommended that we NOT do radiation and he basically said Tamoxifen was a waste of time and pain. He said there was no need to put myself through the side effects and all the meds that try to counter act the side effects. He said he doesn't see the proof that it really works after many years of research.  I am so young I decided to take his advice.  I did surgery with no radiation and I did not take the Tamoxifen.  I have two friends right now suffering on it.  We all have to make our own decisions.  They both had DCIS, one had a single masectomy and the other had lumpectomy and radiation.  One thing I have learned that is very important...we cannot make the decision for others.  We should not every make people feel badly for their decision.  I have encountered people like this face to face in my journey.  It blows my mind.  We get the information and do the best we can to make the decision that is right for us.",
