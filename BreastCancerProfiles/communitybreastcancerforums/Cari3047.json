I also had a deadline.  Wanted to be finished to go on a cruise Jan 25.  My RO gave me the choice of US or Canadian protocol to finish in time.  Canadian is shorter time period and studies show it's just as effectvei with early stage BC. She mentioned doing two treatments in one day as an option if I missed a day, and said that if I did there would need to be 6 hours in between.  I haven't had to do it though.   I'm receiving 18 treatments and have 7 left to go finishing Jan 14.  Total 4788 c Good luck!",

Ellen, My RO didn't know how many treatments I would have until after she did the calculations from my simulation.  I had a cruise planned on Jan 25 and wanted to postpone rads until after.  She got me in for simulation the day after I saw her and started my first treatment two days later so I could finish and heal a bit before trip.  It wasn't until after the simulation that a rad tech called and asked if I preferred mornings or afternoons. I was given a full schedule at my first treatment.  The have been very accommodating with schedule changes and I have had to make several for various reasons. Other than schedule changes though,  It's been my experience that talking to the RO about any and all concerns or issues is the only way to get results.   aeryno, I am 2/3 finished with treatment and have exercised almost every day.  I do free weights and  and up to an hour of cardio almost every day.  I feel better the days I do than not.  I do try and sched my treatment in the afternoon and exercise before because I get tired earlier in the evening than usual. Thanks to everyone who addressed my concerns for being in the sun later this month for my trip.  I took my daughter and her friends to Disney World for her birthday on Sunday and was very uncomfortable in the heat.  I was wearing a very light cotton sports bra and cotton tshirt, but ended up taking the bra off and just going natural and felt better.  Thank god 'the girls' are small and I'll never see any of those people again!  lol Batcatlady thanks for link to skin thread! Great advice on there to wash new clothing before you wear it because of chemicals in the fabric that can cause an allergic reaction on our zapped skin!  Wondering if that could be the cause of the rash I have had off and on since starting rads.....",

Two days later the skin broke and it looks like raw meat underneath.

As far as my rads are going, I finished number 7 on Friday.  The skin is starting to change now with some dark patches and I woke up yesterday with a rash of tiny bumps that cover from under my arm across and on my chest up to my neck and even a few on my untreated breast.  I have been using Aquaphor 2 or 3 times daily and organic aloe  liquid, not gel when I feel the burn.  It gives me immediate relief and I like the liquid because it absorbs completely into the skin and I can put the Aquaphor on after.  I'm not crazy about the vaseline like consistency of the Aquaphor and looking to try something else.",

I'm not a rah rah, warm and fuzzy girl... nothing against those who are... I'm just not. My skin has held up pretty well. Very dark red and itchy, but no breaks.  I have been using a thin layer of Aquaphor 4 or 5 times a day this past 8 days and washing with Dove soap.  I tried some hydocortisone cream for itching, but it didn't help much.  I take Benedryl before bed and that helps quite a bit not only for itching, but helping me sleep better. I saw my RO today and she told me that the skin will continue to burn for 5 days after my last treatment, reaching it's worst on day 5 before starting to heal.  I thought that was interesting to pass along. Tomorrow I have my full body bone scan and torso CAT scan.  Then no appointments scheduled until Feb 3 when I'll see my MO. At that time I'm expected to make a decision on whether or not I'll take the Tamaxofin for 5 years.  My MO had previously given me reoccurrence rates in 10 years of 7% with and 20% without it. Has anyone with a similar diagnosis been given similar rates? Thanks again TeamKim for this thread.  It has really helped me a lot through my rad journey and thanks to those of you who have read my rants and replied.  Wishing everyone on here the smoothest of  treatment and best of health moving forward!",
