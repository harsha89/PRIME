You could ask your doctors to refer you to someone for genetic counseling, or you can find more information yourself at www.DNADirect.com.  (The website gives good information and DNA Direct has genetic counselors on staff where you can talk to them by phone).  Another good website with information about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, that other members have referred to as well, is the FORCE website, Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, at www.facingourrisk.org Did you make the doctors appt you planned to make before?  How did it go?  ",
