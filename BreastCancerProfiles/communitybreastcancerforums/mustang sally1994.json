I have found a lump in my left breast upper inner quad. the mammogram and ultrasound came back negative, I still have the lump and it has grown, and I now have discharge from the nipple which is very very sore, I feel my Dr isn't really bothered by all of this. Why I am more concerned, is 13 yrs ago I had a lumpectomy from my right breast, the lump is now in the left breast. I lost my mother to breast cancer, she was the same age I am now, which is 49. What can I ask for from my Dr for further investigation. I have read that things can come back negative but they are wrong. Could this be happening to me. I just don't know how to make my Dr listen, it isn't easy getting another Dr here in Canada, and I have been with him for more than 30yrs, you would think he would listen to me as I don't complain to often. What would one do if they were me?? Log in to post a reply",

I have concern's i have recently had a mammogram and ultrasound and from what the receptionist said it was ok, my concern's are, I have a lump, that I found a few months ago but did nothing about it, it grew so i went to see the dr and he sent me for the above. I have not spoken to my Dr as he was on vacation. It feels like he isn't bothered by the fact that i have already had a lumpectomy 15yrs ago, I have lost my mother to breast cancer, my sister to cervical cancer and just last week my niece was diagnosed. I now have discharge and bleeding from the nipple and its sore, i called today since he's back from vacation and he wanted me to go to a walk in clinic. Am I crazy for having concerns??
