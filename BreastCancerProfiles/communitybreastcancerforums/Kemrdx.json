I have been taking it for a week and am noticing a bit of improvement.  You can get the supplement at Walmart in the vitamin section. Kathy",

My eyes didn't start swelling until I started Chemo again, it's not from the steroids since I only take 4 mg once a week, didn't think it was about the WBR, but who knows. 2. Horrible dry mouth and my teeth got infected which made me have to go on antibiotics. 3. Appetite is slowly coming back but I lost at least 10lbs in the last 3 months. I had to force myself to eat the first month or so. 4. Ears were plugged for about 2 weeks shortly after, but they are fine now. 5. Still have rubbery legs and lose my balance a bit if I turn too fast. 6. Lost most of my hair and since I am now on Taxol I suppose I have to get used to being bald - least of my problems lol. 7. 6 week follow-up MRI was clear as bell and my tumor markers are coming down:)",

I'm on antibiotics for it right now and my teeth are getting better. My understanding is that they can give you shots to prevent it so I would ask about it. Other than still getting minor headaches (Tylenol) and a little dizzy if I turn too fast I seem to be doing ok, just wish my cooked salivary glands would start working again LOL.",

I was taken off the ckinical trial in Sept 2011 when I ended up with Cancer seeded it in my brain.  Had WBR and am on taxol and avastin so ha-ha my nails look like crap and I am bald again, oh well, onc just said today hes is going to give me a taxol break after the next session if the pet comes back as good as he thinks It will.  So basically,I got 19 months out of this combo and felt pretty much normal most of the time.  Gemzar might make your hair thin and if you are having difficulties with SE's ask that your onc lower your dose - it's you body and you are going to die from this damn disease anyway so why be miserable at the same time.  Sending you hugs  --  Kathy",
