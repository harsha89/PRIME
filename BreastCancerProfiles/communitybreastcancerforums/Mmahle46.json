I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer I just realized the first part of my post was missing.  This is a list I found on a board here.  I couldn't find the link again so just posted it from the word doc. I saved.  I hope this will help y'all there were a few things on here that I know I hadn't thought of. Thanks-Mary",

To all those starting this week Good luck!  It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  It was not pleasant and I'm sure not looking forward to 2 weeks from now.  I know its scary not knowing so after you get through the first one it will be easier as you will know what to expect. Calamtykel-I asked about giving the Neulasta shot at home and my oncologist wouldn't let me.  I don't know why its an easy shot to do.  It worked out that I had to bring a pump home with me and \"chemo at home\" for 24 hrs anyway.  So, I have to go back in after every tx to give the pump back and get the shot.  I hope yours lets you just take it at home as it would sure be easier on you.  I'm sure your nurse friend can show you how to do it.  Practice on an Orange first.

Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte",

Ebay wigs---I ended up getting one from a person it was new with tags for $12.99 lol...I don't really like it though it looks kind of like a mullet..I'm going to see if my hair dresser can fix it up.  The one in my profile I got at Sam Moon for $34 and I like that one.  Its similar in style to my own hair.  I ordered another from ebay for $50.00 its long and wavy.  I need it trimmed a little in the bang area. Good luck on the China wigs!  I can't wait to see how they look. I was at the ER with my daughter tonight.  She is pregnant and had a bad UTI since last Thursdays visit to the ER now its in her kidneys we have to have an ultrasound done tomorrow of her kidneys and the baby.  The baby is fine though.  Hopefully, they can figure out what is wrong with her and get her fixed up.  Its so hard seeing her in so much pain.  This has been a stressful day and I'm glad its over.
