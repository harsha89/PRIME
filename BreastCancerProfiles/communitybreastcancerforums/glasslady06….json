The other thing that helped me was the faith based cancer support group I was already attending with my husband who was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2009.  If you have a support group available in your area, I encourage you to attend as soon as you are well enough to do so. Clothing was another thing I had not prepared well for.  I qualified for focused radiation (mammosite) which required a catheter to be inserted into the area where the tumor was removed.  This catheter stuck out about 8 inches externally.  This meant no regular bra during the 5 days I had the catheter and wearing a bra during the healing process (and the summer time) was not easy some days. So be sure to think about your wardrobe.   For now, I wish you all well in your upcoming procedures.  My prayers will be with you. ",

After a few days of not being able to get comfortable, I stopped in at a Bed Bath and Beyond after my radiation treatment to pick up a bedrest (the kind with arms).  When placed on top of a plump pillow, you can get fairly comfortable if you need to be in a semi-upright position in bed.  Of course, pillow coming off the armrest areas also help.  Hang in there..  it does get better. ",
