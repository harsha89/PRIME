Beginning of Oct I started having pain in my right breast, I didn't think anything of it but it was time for my annual mammogram so I made the appointment. Soonest they had was Nov 14. So about the middle of Oct I was still having the pain so I got to feeling around, I felt what was may be a lump. I wasn't really sure because I have never done self breast exams so I have no idea what is normal for me, but in that area it was tender. I had my husband feel and he said it felt like a lump to him too. Well I basically put it out of mind and just waited for my appointment. I wasn't real concerned because I had been called back every year for 3 years after my annual and everything was always ok. But for some reason I felt like this was different. So I finally had my appointment Nov, 14, 2016. They did the mammogram and I waited. They called me back in for more pics, more magnified, and then I waited. I was then called back into the ultrasound room where they did the ultra sound. I could clearly see the \"mass\" but it meant nothing to me because I had no clue what I was looking at or looking for. The doctor then came in and ask a bunch of questions. He was very wishy washy about saying anything. It was rather strange really, almost like he was talking to himself and trying to figure out what this may or may not be. It short he acted as though he really had no clue and it could go either way (cancer or not cancer). He gave me a couple options, we could run some various blood tests and see what they say and then go from there or we could do a biopsy. I opted for the biopsy, let cut to the chase I said. Biopsy was then set for Nov 16, 2016 at 7:30 am. I was a tad nervous but not really just ready to get it over with. I was a wreck inside. I show up on 11/16/16 for the biopsy and was immediately told the computers were down and they were rescheduling everyone. OMG!! They were going to make me wait a whole week!! So 11/22/16. I was so furious!! I wasn't just angry, I was FURIOUS!! That day I didn't want to talk to anyone! But that day something switched in me and I calmed down, I no longer was completely freaking out and worried and stressing. I had a calm come over me. I am still concerned but I feel like I already know the answer to what my result will be. My gut, my 6th sense tells me it is cancer, BUT it could also be my paranoia telling me that, but I don't think so. I have talked with God and I am ok. Some may read this and think this lady is totally nuts. That's ok, I felt the need to put this all in writing so that one day I can look back on it. I will even go as far as to document that I believe that my results will show IDC stage 3. I maybe crazy and totally wrong time will tell, in a week or less I will know if I am right or wrong.
