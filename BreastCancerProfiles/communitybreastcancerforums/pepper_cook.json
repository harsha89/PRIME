My ps says do what is most comfortable. Thanks in advance. 7/20/10 Bilateral Mastectomies, Nipple Sparing, Right Sentinal Node biopsy, Tissue expanders, 0/1 lymph node Log in to post a reply",

You will need to tell surgery staff if you have a tampon in because you do not whant to leave it in to long. It would be best if you could wear a pad and panties but I had a catheter for my mastectomy and exchange = no panties. The surgery staff will help you. Do not worry .... they deal with this all the time. it is no biggie. nothing to stress over.",

I just came right out and asked if this was an option and she said certainly. It took a month for insurance to approve the procedure. The waiting is so hard. I do feel fortunate so far but we will see what the future holds after diagnosis. I know the surgery will be done but will I face chemo or radiation?  I hope not.",
