I have had 6/20 treatments thus far and am beginning to feel mild fatigue and notice some minor pink across the treatment area. Using Midaderm as recommended by my doctor. Yesterday I had to take a two-hour nap in the afternoon. First time for that. My treatments are very short. I'm in the prone position. The therapy beam comes from two different angles, each for about 30 seconds (I counted while the machine buzzed). Every five treatments they take x-rays to ensure that the treatment is going as they expect and every Monday I see the RO to discuss my progress and any symptoms. So far so good, I guess. Veeder14--I have asthma and allergies. This time of the year is the worst for me, as trees begin leafing out and blooming. I can relate to your dizziness and other symptoms. Hoping you find relief quickly!",

Saw the RO yesterday and he said my breast looked as he expected, but he still wants to follow up again in 2 weeks. His advice is to continue with the Miaderm plus hydrocortisone creme if I'm itchy. And continue to go without a bra as much as possible. IOW, the same skin care as during radiation. Felinemum--My RO wanted nothing to do with my protracted respiratory infection. It's not radiation pneumonitis. Saw the internist today, had an x-ray to rule out pneumonia, and got a prescription for antibiotics for what she believes is a secondary sinus infection following a bad cold. And she advised me to stay home for a few days, too. (As if I hadn't been hanging out at home all this time, coughing etc. like an ordinary cold.) At least the exhaustion I'd been having following radiation has begun to let up. Kaywrite--Thank you for sharing your experiences with us. Very moving.

Tomorrow they plan to measure for the targeted treatment to just the tumor bed (treatments 17-20). I thought my skin might get better after the whole breast radiation was over (in three days). But today the RO said to expect my redness, itchiness, and burning to get worse before it gets better, and his assistant said that it could worsen for a week after treatment stops completely. Fortunately the fluocinonide cream has stopped the night waking from itching. Still using the Midaderm along with the other cream, and it's great for moisturizing the whole area. Having the weekend off always seems to make my symptoms better (even if that's all in my head). I got through a weekend with my daughter and her family (including my three grandchildren) and did not have to nap when the two-year-old took hers, so I considered that a success! Doubleblooming--thank you. Last week was up and down but this week so far has been fine. About traveling for treatment: After my diagnosis, when I saw a local surgeon, I asked for a recommendation for a second opinion. He suggested someone three hours away at a large medical center/teaching hospital. We traveled to consult with her, and I chose to have her as my surgeon, particularly after experiencing the level of expertise and knowledge she had after our first consultation. She ended up recommending a second biopsy, for an issue they felt must be identified, because it meant the difference between lumpectomy and mastectomy surgeries; the suspicious area turned out to be benign. All of this meant traveling back and forth several times, and staying in a nearby hotel for each visit/treatment. After my surgery was over, I saw a local medical oncologist, who recommended a local RO; I like the RO and his staff very much. The local clinic where he practices is a 15 minute drive from my home. My daily treatment takes no more than an hour including travel. Even though the well-known surgeon recommended an MO and an RO in the practice far away, I feel like the care I'm getting from the local RO is probably equal to that of the other practice because he trained at the large teaching hospital where I had my surgery. (And when I mentioned him to the surgeon, she agreed--because he trained in their practice. Ha ha!) Traveling for treatment can be quite wearing. Long story I won't relate here, but in the 1990s I had a family member with leukemia who had to travel back and forth for treatment for years (and I was with her most of that time). It's isolating to be far away from everything familiar and everyone who cares about you. If you have to travel for treatment, I hope you're not away for very long, and I hope you have someone with you at least part of the time you're away.",

I went in to have my first \"boost\" and questioned the positioning; they had outlined an area between 12 and 2 o'clock on my breast but my tumor and surgery were at 10 o'clock (using the clock metaphor that pathologists use to identify where tumors are in the breast). The RO came in and explained the issue he saw on my CT: the surgeon had done such a great job closing the tumor bed that he couldn't identify the space left behind (which I knew was true, because they'd told me that after surgery--they were trying to avoid a concave spot on my breast so they had closed the space as effectively as they could). As a result, since the RO had seen some anomalies at 12 and 2, he was planning to target those areas under an assumption that the surgeon had probably removed the tumor on a diagonal. I said, \"But if you think about the ductal biology, that makes little sense for a 1 cm tumor. 10, 12 and 2 are too far apart.\" He said he'd prefer, then, to replan and use a larger target for the boost. So I reluctantly agreed. But as I was driving home, I realized that the anomalies between 12 and 2 were the same ones identified by MRI months ago. I had MRI-guided biopsies that proved there was no tumor at those locations. So I called the RO back to discuss. (He was unavailable.) When I finally got to speak with him, and told him about the previous biopsies and the clips that had been left behind, I conjectured that he was seeing the scars from tissue removed from the biopsies plus the clips, which I'd had at a different medical center. He had already reviewed my previous imaging, which showed my tumor, and my post-surgery CT scan, and agreed with me. He said he had been a little confused because surgeons sometimes leave the clips to guide radiation, which was what he thought he was seeing on the CT; my surgeon had removed the clip from the area of my tumor but the clips from the benign biopsies were still there. So...now the RO and his team are going to replan to provide the \"boost\" to the area where I had my surgery, NOT to the areas that did not have any cancer. Whew! I'm reporting all of this in part to let you all know to ask questions if you're not sure that things are going along as you think they should. I might have had radiation to an area that did not need it, and that could have caused additional fibrosis to my breast, if I'd allowed the first plan to proceed. And I might not have gotten the radiation to the area that needed it. All of this also means that I will have a few days' break in radiation and won't be finishing as soon as I had hoped. But in all, I'm not disappointed. I'm happy that my RO was open to my questioning and that we figured out why he was seeing what he'd seen on the CT scan. Not only that, I'm going to meet with the RO and go over the imaging and the plan before they begin, just to ensure that I'm comfortable with everything. He is really the kind of doctor that I need--he really listened to me--and adjusted once he had additional information. So I'm relieved this afternoon. And I'll have a long weekend before my next session.",

Told him that I already take Zyrtec for my allergies; so I can't add another. He said to expect the rashes to get a little worse before they get better (I have rashes in several places; the worst is under the breast). But: In two weeks, he said, I should be doing much better.

I haven't been able to read all the posts in groups that currently exist. There are just too many! So I have some questions for those of you who are about to start taking any of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Bear with me while I explain before I ask my questions. I started taking anastrozole before radiation began, around the first of March, on the advice of all three oncologists (SO, MO, RO) involved in my care. Since then I've had hot flashes and joint pain. Prior to my BC diagnosis, I'd already had serious arthritis in my right hip and lumbar spine. I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis eight years ago; my hip is now bone-on-bone. My consult with the orthopedic surgeon was scheduled before my BC diagnosis. When I saw him, he just told me to call him when I was ready to have my hip replacement, well after my cancer treatment is over, since cancer treatment always takes precedence. And I have been diagnosed with both early cataracts and early macular degeneration. As you can tell, the published side effects of anastrozole are a real and pressing concern to me. On a daily basis I have had back pain and hip pain serious enough to limit my mobility. Since I started taking anastrozole, the pain has increased in my spine. I'm now taking ibuprofen almost every day; some nights the pain keeps me awake. And recently my right knee has begun to ache on a daily basis as well. My hip seems to be about the same. I've been sticking with anastrozole because my MO said the side effects tend to decrease over time for many women. That's been true for me with the hot flashes, but not so much for the joint pain. Yet it's hard to tease out whether my joints are just getting worse or if the drug is the cause, unless I discontinue taking it. I will see the MO again in a couple of weeks, which is why I've been keeping a diary of symptoms. One concern I've had about the MO's practice has been his lack of concern for my orthopedic history and the lack of suggested baseline bone scan. Is it typical for an MO who prescribes AIs to order a baseline bone scan? Have any of you had a bone scan in advance of beginning aromatase inhibitor therapy? If this is inappropriate, I will post to another forum.",

The area of my boosts continues to get worse in terms of symptoms--itching and pain, for example--but the area under my breast, which was always the worst, hasn't improved yet. Still doing skin care as directed and it does help with discomfort. Just as an added complication, I've developed some sort of respiratory infection. Seems like a bad cold, but I'm concerned about lung impacts since I also have asthma. Should this infection get worse, I'm not even sure which doctor to call...oncologist (which one?), internist, pulmonologist?!? This is an aspect of cancer care that frustrates me. When my daughter had leukemia, her pediatric hematologist was the point-of-contact, period. Anything that happened, from a fever to a fall would be reported through their office. With adult cancer, there's so much specialization, the patient really has no clue. When I was diagnosed by a general surgeon, I asked, \"Who will coordinate my care?\" and got a blank stare in return. Our medical center does not have nurse navigators. They have 'navigators' who are mainly schedulers. That's not the kind of navigation I want or need. Just venting here. But really, adult cancer could use some of the same coordinated care I experienced with my daughter. On the day of her diagnosis, I received a binder with most of my basic questions already answered: When to call; who to call; what to expect in clinic and hospital; how to understand blood work; how to keep track of expenses, including pockets for your bills and numbers for the business offices; maps of all relevant places; available support groups and when they met; lists of everyone in the practice, with phone numbers, including dietician, social worker...etc. I didn't read it all on the first day, but I had it when I wanted it, and a social worker handed it to me and explained what it was for so I'd know where to look when I was ready. But that was in a highly specialized pediatric cancer care center in a major city. Never got much of that where I'm being treated; the RO's office was better (they handed out a folder with skin care info, fatigue info, and nutrition tips) but the MO gave me nothing to take away. Maybe having an introductory folder is something I should recommend to my MO. Sad part is--he's not necessarily the first oncologist you see when you have breast cancer; you could, as I did, encounter the surgeon first. Talking to the surgeon was an entirely different experience. And I never did get an answer on who would coordinate my care so taking away an empty folder wouldn't help. Sorry for the long venting. Maybe I can make a difference for the next newly diagnosed person in that clinic by making a few suggestions anyway.",

By my third week, I was very tired every day and napped daily and slept a little more at night as well. While my skin never broke through, it was very red, sore, itchy, and tender for the last two weeks of treatment plus three weeks afterwards. I could not wear a bra the entire time and did not start wearing one again until four weeks after treatment had completed. I don't know if something like that would interfere your vacation fun. I'm six weeks out now. My RO declared that my skin is fine and that I could wear bras again; and I haven't napped in weeks. I should mention that I did get a respiratory infection right after my treatment had completed, which may have affected my energy--and the napping and need for additional sleep at night. I think everyone responds differently, so you may not know how you will do. My RO did say that radiation continues to \"work\" after your treatments are over, so you can expect some impact, whatever that may be. Hope that helps you a little bit.",

For those of you who are working during treatment, more power to you! I cannot imagine how I would have gotten through everything while working. My fatigue by itself makes me forgetful and slow. My skin is beginning to get more irritated now. Had been doing Miaderm 3x/day but last night I had itching and burning across my breast that woke me up twice in the night. They prescribed something the nurse called \"Lidex\" (generic: fluocinonide) cream. Hoping that keeps me sleeping through the night. It's applied before the Miaderm twice a day. I'm a natural redhead so I expected to have some skin irritation. Hoping to get through the next 8 treatments without too many additional issues. Forgot to mention this: The nursing staff at my RO's office insisted that I not wear a bra throughout my treatment. The friction of fabric on the treatment area from a bra, particularly one with a wire, is thought to make any skin issues much worse, and the under-breast area and underarm area, I was told, would have the worst reactions. I was instructed to wear cotton clothing against the skin, and to wear a cami or tank top under a loose shirt instead of a bra if I wanted more modesty. (And, if I could, to go without any shirt at least an hour a day.) So I've been walking around without a bra for a couple of weeks and it feels very strange and uncomfortable. But I cannot bring myself to wear any kind of bra after the warnings I got about further irritating my already very pink and irritated skin. Never thought I'd say that I'll be happy for the day when I can put my bra back on; it was always a relief to take it off every evening! kaywrite--I had a terrible day yesterday too. Near tears twice and just down overall, without any provoking events. Today was better. Seems normal to have ups and downs during treatment, at least for me.

So I won't repeat that story. Today I went in and saw the RO to discuss the new plan. He showed me my MRI and CT scan and compared them to another patient's, in order to reveal how he usually plans for radiation and how different my MRI and CT scan looked from the one he considered a more typical set of images. They were significantly different in part because my surgery did not leave a large \"hollow\" area where my tumor had been. Also I had a second clip in my breast from a biopsy of an area that had proven benign, which is atypical. One of the problems for him, in his planning, was that he didn't have the MRI of the benign area which I had done in another medical center; he did not even know those images existed! (Not sure why that disconnect happened.) But it led him to conclude that the remaining clip area was in need of treatment because the surgeon had removed the clip from the tumor area. He then reviewed the new plan, which made more sense to me. And he thanked me for speaking up and apologized for difficulties. As I said to him, I wasn't trying to question his expertise--I just want the best possible outcome whatever that takes. This is a doctor who's earned my respect, I must say. It is rare for doctors (in my experience at least) to listen to a patient's concerns, be honest in his assessment, take into consideration what I'd asked about, and then take the time to reconsider his planning. After we spoke, the radiation technicians set me up for the new area, marked my skin, made a template for the boosts, took measurements, and confirmed with the RO before I had my first treatment. I am so happy I spoke up last week. If you have any doubts or concerns with your treatment, ask questions and keep asking until you understand what's going on. It was so worth it for me. Now I only have three treatments left to go!",

Apart from the various types of skin discomfort, I've been awakened by shooting and stabbing pains in my treated breast. (It feels a bit like I'm having multiple injections into my breast repeatedly and simultaneously. Since I've had multiple lidocaine injections prior to biopsy, I remember how that felt.) Ibuprofen usually calms those pains and I'm able to return to sleep. When I'm riding or driving in a car and the road is rough, since I'm not wearing a bra, there's quite a lot of movement of my breast, which can be very uncomfortable. I've literally had to hold my breast against my chest in one position under those conditions. Sometimes I can just be sitting somewhere and get a series of stabbing pains that seem to calm themselves down after a few minutes. Overall, I've been assuming that the sensations I've had are related to tissue injury and repair from treatment, so I did not report any of these symptoms to the RO so far. But I've been keeping a symptom diary so I can when I see him in my follow-up. ",

So cancer treatment comes first.] The RO said that, with my history, I may be unable to tolerate anastrozole side effects; I'm noticing greater joint pain after only two weeks. So radiation may prevent BC recurrence if I cannot take aromatase inhibitors. But I'm very nervous about radiation. I'm a natural redhead and my skin is extremely sensitive. The RO nurse and co. recommended Miaderm creme for skin, sold only in the clinic's pharmacy.
