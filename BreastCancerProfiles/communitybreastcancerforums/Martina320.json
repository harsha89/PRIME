I actually got in contact with someone at Lifecell (makers of Alloderm) and while several insurance companies are dening the claim for the product they have an entire department of insurance consultants that work with the PS to reverse denials and they are being very succesful at this. I wrote down a list of insures when we spoke and right now, as of 8/14 it seems that United Healthcare, Aetna, and HSCS as well as many of the Blue Cross states are covering it, I live in Florida and BCBS of florida does cover it. Please do not give up because that is what these darn insurance companies hope for. Tell your PS that lifecell can help and \"encourage\" them to contact the company and let them battle it out with the insurance company. It worked for my sister. On another note-I REALLY did research on the graft and Alloderm has been used for over 5 years in Breast Reconstruction and they seem to be the only product with clinical data for use in the breast. The advantages are less post op pain versus full muscle coverage and less complications such as migration of the implant. Martina",
