You are entitled to have it. Ask the doctor to talk through with you the medical speak on the actual report because they can be hard to understand. Ask them what type of biopsy they are doing and ask them to talk through with you what the procedure involves. Also ask when and how you will get the results. Will they tell you same day? Will they call you? Do you need to schedule an appointment to get the results? If you're scared, you can also ask for a prescription for anti-anxiety pills. Keep in mind that 80% of biopsies after abnormal findings on scans turn out to be benign. ",

Unfortunately no one can tell how likely it is that it's cancer, the only way to know for sure is the biopsy. Statistically though most biopsies turn out to be benign, especially when you're young. I had the same symptoms you did and I can say from researching it when I was getting a nipple biopsy that there are several benign conditions that can cause this. I was one of the rare unlucky ones, but for most people that's not the case. Try not to worry until you actually have to (easier said than done, I know), and stay off Googling worst case scenarios. The procedure should not be painful. I've had both VA and core needle biopsies. With an ultrasound procedure, you're lying on your back and you can talk to them throughout the procedure. Tell them at the beginning that you're scared especially about the pain. You should feel pressure but the minute you feel the slightest pain, tell them and they will stop and give you more lidocaine. I would also recommend getting anti-anxiety meds from your doctor, it really helps for the procedure and while waiting for the results. ",

I'm headed for surgery next. I hate it when people tell me to be positive. I'm positive about many things NOT related to cancer. The more I can do to take my mind off it, the better.

I'm not saying that to scare you but more to recommend a couple of things to avoid what I went through. Don't let them put earplugs in you. I couldn't hear what they were saying so I couldn't communicate with them when I was in trouble. When they do the biopsy part, they take a number of samples. Ask them to stop immediately if you feel any pain, and inject some more lidocaine before they continue. They will explain the procedure before they start, and you can ask them what to do if you feel pain (but don't try to move because they use the MRI to locate the lump, so you need to stay still so they get the right place). For me even a strong painkiller wouldn't have helped because the pain was so sudden and strong. And once it's over your breast will be bruised but it doesn't hurt. Sedation on the other hand, I would welcome if I had to do it again just because my last one was so terrifying, but for the majority of people that's not the case.",

I think most of us are referred to a breast surgeon first, but that doesn't mean they will operate right away. When I first met with my surgeon, he ordered a mammogram, ultrasound and MRI. At first based on clinical examination they thought it was small and localized. But the scans showed it was extensive and had gone to the lymph nodes. So the surgeon ordered more biopsies, and when those came back positive they ordered a full body PET/CT scan to find out if it had spread anywhere else (thankfully it hadn't). After all the tests were back the surgeon and medical oncologist consulted and both recommended chemo first. A good breast surgeon WILL want to know exactly what they're dealing with before making a recommendation for timing and type of surgery. Sounds like you need a new oncologist too. Be sure to tell the surgeon all the history you posted because they should take that into account when they order the tests. Because I am very young for breast cancer, the surgeon also referred me for genetic testing, and given the factors you mention, would recommend that. Good luck tomorrow! ",

But if they're biopsying your lymph nodes on the opposite side, it does NOT mean it's stage 4 if they are positive. It might mean you have cancer on the other side too, and having positive lymph nodes might alter their recommendation for what surgery to have and which chemo drugs to give you. My scans showed enlarged lymph nodes on both sides. I had 3 fine needle aspirations of lymph nodes. They were positive on the side of the cancer and negative on the other side. My PET scan additionally showed probable cancer in the chest muscle lymph nodes, but that still makes it stage 3, not 4. The good thing with FNA biopsies is the pathologist was in the room while they did it and I got the results right away. I would recommend taking someone with you. What did your PET results say? Did they scan your whole body? If they didn't find anything in your brain, liver, lungs, or bones, (or somewhere else beyond the breast and surrounding lymph nodes), then you don't have distant metastasis (stage 4). Cancer in lymph nodes is common and considered \"regional metastasis\". Can be stage 2 or 3 depending on the extent. It's curable with some combo of chemo/surgery/radiation. Chemo also takes care of any small cancer cells that may have made it into your blood stream and be lurking somewhere else. I hope you get some relief tomorrow. For me the terror died down a lot once they stopped doing those horrible scans and I started on the chemo. Feel free to message me any time, I am a couple of months ahead of you in this terrible process with a similar type of cancer ",

I think you will get some answers on Monday and would probably get the oncology appointment moved up, or failing that, referral to another oncologist who can see you sooner. It's a good sign that the oncologist is looking at your slides. I saw the surgeon first (I think that's common). Usually the breast surgeon and oncologist work together to come up with a treatment recommendation, and in my case the surgeon had already discussed my case with an oncologist once they got the initial scan results and he took me directly to the oncologists office to see her (I go to a large cancer center where all the doctors are in the same place). It's possible they will need to order some more tests. I also have lymph node involvement, and the surgeon ordered an MRI (had it next day) and a PET/CT to check for spread elsewhere. Oncologist ordered a bunch of blood tests. When the results were all in, the surgeon called me and said he and the MO were both agreed I should have chemo first and I started within a few days. All told it took about 4 weeks for me from diagnosis to start of chemo. During that time I had all the scans and needed 8 biopsies, with several days wait for results between each step. It felt like an eternity but they needed to know exactly what they were dealing with before deciding on treatment. Hope all goes well for you on Monday. ",

The surgery I had was \"stage 2\" of the DIEP reconstruction, so it's much easier than the first stage where they transplant the abdominal tissue to make the breasts. Yesterday they did fat grafting to make the final breast shape, nipple reconstruction, scar revision and liposuction in the flanks, the whole abdomen and the pelvis. The lipo sure looks good. I can't see the breasts yet because they are covered in dressings that I have to keep on until my post-op on Tuesday. No drains this time thank god. I ended up staying in the recovery room for 10 hours. I had a major allergic reaction to an abdominal binder they put on me and had terrible itching and rashes everywhere. They gave me a benadryl injection that didn't work, then another drug that did work but made me sleep the entire day. Between that and the painkillers I had a good night's sleep too. Apparently these binders were new and there were 3 other patients also having the same allergic reaction to it, so the nurses were having to do an official report. Today the pain is manageable with the oxycodone. It feels like I have big bruises everywhere from pelvis to shoulders. 3bears, you were asking about the DIEP. Even before this surgery, I was really happy with the results. The breasts look and feel totally natural. I opted for DIEP because I didn't want the risk of complications (infections etc) that go with implants and I am in my 30s and didn't want to have to do extra surgeries every 10 years to replace them. Also, I am not working at the moment (because of the cancer treatment), so the long recovery time up front was ok for me. The tummy tuck is a nice side-benefit. I did have a complication, which is the abdominal incision reopened. Because of the chemo, I had delayed healing. So I had to have an extra surgery a month ago to fix that. It's been a really long road but I think my breasts are actually going to look better than the originals! Leftcoastie, absolutely the right decision to stay an extra night. I did that too after my first mastectomy, and I really recommend not leaving the hospital until your pain is controlled with whatever pain meds they are sending you home with. It's much harder to get their attention once you're back home.",

The sentinel node biopsy is just a precaution to make sure it didn't sneak into your lymph nodes, but with a small tumor, there's no reason to expect any problems. Dsmom, I didn't find that being young helped with chemo, everyone reacts differently to each drug. I did really well on the most toxic cocktail and had a really hard time with another that's supposed to be \"easier\". Exercise on the other hand really helps with the fatigue and the side effects. I went to the gym as often as I could even if I only did short workouts, chemo scarf and all. Suezie23, It's a hard decision, but I say go for it. Because 1) being BRCA positive, it's worth having the BMX to NOT have to go through the actual cancer, chemo, etc. and 2) the diep flap reconstruction looks really great, very natural, it's your own tissue and you get a tummy tuck thrown in. Fightingirl, thinking of you while you wait -- waiting is horrible. Keep in mind, you do know that no news ISN'T bad news. Until and unless they tell you there is something to worry about, there isn't. I hope you hear tomorrow morning. As for me, I have nipples!!! Real, flesh and blood nipples!

They say you can even take one that morning with a tiny sip of water. Personally I couldn't have got through my surgeries so far without it. Dsmom, you mentioned studies about younger women, and that's a factor my surgeon brought up for me when he recommended BMX (I was 36). They tend to recommend MX more for young women. Part of the reason is not so much recurrence, but higher risk of a new primary breast cancer. If you have a personal history of BC, you're at higher risk for another one, and the risk goes up the younger you are (more years where you could get cancer). Since I've been through more than a year of chemo, I too don't want to have to do this ever again.",

I'm a little excited for this one because this is where I get my nipples and final breast shapes. My results so far are looking really good though. I am one of those for whom BMX was actually the medical recommendation. I had 5 tumors on the right side, cancer in the nipple and in a bunch of lymph nodes. On the left side they had to remove a radial scar and between that and the fact that I'm young, the lumps were not detectable and the cancer was very aggressive, it was best to remove everything. Being part of the \"January 2017\" group makes me realize what a long slog this has been--I first joined the January 2016 chemo group. If you're getting tissue expanders, be prepared for a fair amount of pain in the first few days, and it will look really horrible at first. Once they inflate the expanders it will look much better. They are rock hard, so not the most comfortable, but I did end up with a really nice shape for the final breast. The TEs can be overfilled, so it doesn't matter that much what size they use. It will be up to you and your PS to decide how much to fill them (as long as your skin can stretch), and you can always change your mind later about size or type of reconstruction.",

I also had excruciating burning pain from the nerves being cut, and for that I took Neurontin. For the exercises, just go as far as you are comfortable (but not in pain) and repeat many times.

It depends on your pathology, but if you have a large tumor, or if you are triple negative or HER2+, I think they always recommend chemo. It's not for the lump itself, but because chemo is a systemic treatment and kills cancer cells that may have already escaped from your breast or lymph nodes and stops them setting up shop somewhere else. Leftcoastie, totally understand why you feel sad about the chemo. Vargadoll, if you see other women with a similar diagnosis as yours having a mastectomy, it may be because that's their preference, for whatever reason (family history, don't want to deal with this again, etc). Surgeons like to recommend saving the breast if they can, but at the end of the day it's your decision. If you are in the US, I don't think the insurance companies will pay for genetic testing unless you are under 40 or there is a strong family history of BC. I would tell your nieces in due course, when the time is right for you, so that they are aware they have some family history of BC and get regular screening.",

You will feel better once the cancer is out, you get the pathology report and you know exactly what you're dealing with. Fightingirl, I don't think you need to second-guess your choice. Losing the whole breast is a really big deal, and as you know there is no significant difference in recurrence. If you do a lumpectomy, you can always opt for mastectomy later if you change your mind, or you don't get clean margins, etc. But once a breast is gone there's no going back. It never crossed my mind to go for mastectomy until I was told the cancer was very extensive and that was my only choice.",

It might depend whether you're getting tissue expanders or not, with no reconstruction recovery is easier. However if you call them up and tell them you're having surgery for cancer it's likely they would exchange the tickets free of charge. Have to be at the hospital at 6am tomorrow for surgery, so just doing last minute things tonight.",

If it was me, for the pain, I would take it off now temporarily. If that relieves the problem, good. Either way, call your surgeons office first thing and explain the problem. There are other potential sources of pain such as nerve pain (from nerves being cut, it feels like burning), seroma or hematoma, infection, etc. And you should have them find the source of the problem. Annoyingboob, funny you should mention the bungalows. Last night I stayed up until 4am on Google looking for where these dream bungalows actually are (because yes, I fully intend to treat myself to something special). And then thinking hmmm...where is French Polynesia? Could I really handle such a long trip after 7 surgeries and 15 months of chemo? Probably not... But I'm still looking. I found some in Jamaica too: https://www.overwaterbungalows.net/win-3-nights-in.... ",

It's hard enough when one of our pets dies, but when it happens at the same time as a cancer diagnosis...there are no words. SheilaW8, I also have a black area on the top of a nipple and I'm wondering what's going to happen with it. Cowboy-up, don't get too stressed about your surgery estimate (as long as your hospital and your surgeon and your anesthesiologist are all in network). Their estimates don't take into account the out of pocket max, they do that when they get the actual bill. Just don't pay over any more than your insurance max. My hospital just sent me a bill for $55,000 for my last 2 chemos - way over my out of pocket max, and when I called to complain, they said that was a \"discounted\" rate (actual bill was $200,000). Told them to send it to the insurance. Annoyingboob, you're so right about how everything drags out into months and months. I think for me it will be 18 months by the time I finish and I'm prone to sudden outbursts of tears when I see how everyone's moved on with their life while my ordeal just keeps getting worse. At the end of it I will have to look for a job and I'm dreading the question about why the 18 month gap in my resume. I do feel lucky to be here, because they don't do mammos for women under 40 and they couldn't feel any of my lumps. I had my first (and last) mammo AFTER I had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I owe my life to a dermatologist who thought a bit of flaky skin on the nipple was worthy of a biopsy. At first they thought it was a very small cancer and chemo had never occurred to me until they dropped the bombshell that the cancer was to extensive to operate and chemo was my only option. Earlier today I was filling in an online registration for a new doctors office and it asked for my insurance details. As my husband is the insured person I put in his name and then there's a field for \"relationship to patient\". So you have all the normal options, spouse, child, significant other, etc and then one of the options is...\"cadaver donor\"!!! I just laughed. Then I had to put in my surgery history and it wouldn't allow more than 5 surgeries, but I've had 6, so I laughed again...",
