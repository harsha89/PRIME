I just got the written report from the ct scan I had a couple of weeks ago. Imagine my surprise when it mentions that my thyroid is symmetrical and without nodules... WTF because I had my thyroid removed in 2010!!! This really pissed me off!! Excuse the language. Now it makes me doubt the stable result. I'm sure it's my scan because it mentions my lung nodule, gallstones and spinal stenosis, all of which I have. My onc will be hearing about this, I want abother read of the scan by someone else.",

They were users and he couldn't see it, gave them money, time, house repairs, etc. they came to him for everything and treated me like shit. It wasn't until I got Cancer in 2008 that he finally had his eyes opened. They totally ignored my illness, surgery, etc. never asked about me or even asked him how he was coping. He finally cut all ties with them and peace came into our life. His mother passed away a couple of years ago, we read about it in the paper. He did not attend the funeral, on that day we went and adopted ours rescue cats. He said he felt like he wanted to do a good deed on that day. Glad your brother is coming along. He will be weak and tired for some time and have to slowly build his strength back up. I so remember my dad needing 2 of us to get him out of the carwhen he came home after his heart attack .",

This will be the first Christmas in 15 years that I don't have to worry about my work schedule and I would like to try to enjoy it. I'm getting a redraw on Monday to recheck my tumor markers which went up 15 points last month, I might just ask my onc to order the scan sooner then later to just get it over with.

Onc wanted to wait 3 weeks then redraw which I did last week. They are 62 on the redraw. My onc wants to scan because she doesn't like the uptick of the tumor markers. All other bloodwork is \"perfect\" according to her, including liver enzymes which she monitors closely. So the scan should give us some answers. But I HATE the anxiety that comes with the scan.

After all that ..forget it, no more surgery. I have a good prosthesis, it doesn't bother me to go flat at home when I'm not going out.

I told him I'll probably be gone by then..hurts to say out loud but probably true. Really makes you realize how much this $#*@ cancer takes from us!

Wouldn't you think stage 4 cancer is enough??? They want to know how often do you shop, clean, watch tv, cook, read,etc. They requested and received over 200 pages of my oncology records, hello??? Why would anyone who wasn't disabled have 200 pages of oncology records. I don't know how anybody can get away with cheating the system like I hear some people do with all the information they need.

This is my favorite story of my husband... When I had my bilateral mastectomy in 2008 ( little did we know then that cancer would become metastatic) I was in the hospital. My chest was covered with orange Betadine, drains and staples and was frightening even to me. I told my husband that he might as well see it all now, the good, the bad, and the ugly. He looked at me standing there in the bathroom of my hospital room and said these words....\" Do you know what I see when I look at you?

My youngest has a goal to be on his own within a year. He and his girlfriend are actively saving for an apartment. As far as cancer goes, I think that either they just don't get it or they just don't want to deal with it. As much as I've tried to prepare them they are still saying I will be fine.

I threw mine in the trash. My Mom is so upset and just wants her to leave her alone. I feel that these attempts to reconcile with us are for monetary reasons...she knows that my mom is 80 and has plenty of money. What she doesn't know is that Mom updated her will and wrote a paragraph in there specifically leaving her out. I hate the drama that she is trying to bring into our lives",

Very frustrating. I know I don't post much but I read every day. Been going through a rough couple weeks with fatigue and just totally freaking out to think that this is what my life is now. Filling out tons of paperwork to transition to long term disability. So NOT how I wanted to end my career.",

In my case, the amount is less then 1 of my 2 pay checks that I get a month. I have decided to go back to work and work as long as I can.

I cried when I heard it but it's too late, I did not respond. I guess she didn't want a living sister but she wants a dying one. Go figure. I tell or here's that I love her...from a distance.

My other son is in and out, always going somewhere, leaving a mess wherever he goes. He pays $200 rent and pays his cell phone and car insurance. It really never occurs to him to help me, if I ask him he will but he will walk right past every mess or a full trash can or sink full of dishes. Frustrating for sure and his room is a total pig pen. My middle son was just like that, but once he moved out on his own he did a 180. His place is spotless and he is extremely helpful. All of them are always saying how tired they are. I always tell them if they think they are tired now, try adding a house and a few kids, then tell me how tired they are. But they are all good. \" kids\", never any issues with drugs or alcohol or trouble with the law so I'll pick my battles. But I totally get your frustrations for sure.",

About 35 of my good friends were there and boy the tears are flowing! I am so blessed! I left work so suddenly that I didn't get to say goodbye to everyone so this was like my retirement party. We didn't call it that because work doesn't know that I'm not coming back. Got lots of nice gifts, some to restaurants, supermarkets, bookstores, Wawa, and some candles and cozy pajamas. My whole family was in on it and I never knew. I am still crying today. If I can figure out how to get pictures from my phone onto my iPad i will try to post, probably have to get my sons to do it.",

It takes a very strong person to do what you have done and I hope you give yourself credit. That being said, now is a time of adjustment for all of you. You are adjusting to being on your own and while freedom is exciting it can also be scary at the same time. Your husband is adjusting to now realize that his actions and poor judgement are now coming back to haunt him. Hang tight and let all of this settle and sink in, I think it will take some time for all of you. The time apart will show you how strong you really are and will show your husband that you will not let him determine your happiness. You seem to like your new surroundings and that's a positive thing. As for the blonde bimbo..no marriage needs a third person in it. Your husbands first priority should always be you.

She has a life alert also for any emergencies. She has poor short term memory, I'm glad she doesn't cook or drive. My kitties are all from rescues, such good company for me since I'm alone most of the day. The black one is very big and always squeezes herself into that little bed. She was rescued from a drug addicts home. The black and white one was rescued from a junkyard and she loves that basket! I put it out just for her every year. The brown one was rescued off of the streets , we just got her in September from the rescue I was volunteering at. She would be laying in a cage lined with newspaper...not anymore! She loves her new blanket! I love seeing everyone's pictures! This group has been such a blessing to me, always welcoming and no judgements. Thanks to you Micmel for setting the tone.

They also said that mothers and Father's Day will provide the cash for food and spending money. How wonderful. We all went together last year and it was wonderful. I won't lie if I say that this holiday season has been very emotional for me. I cried as I watched the ball drop last night, wondering what the new year will bring. I will turn 58 on Thursday and wonder if I will make it to 59. The cold weather is very isolating as well, it's 7 here. Pajama day for me",

Then I took my 80 year old mom to a local festival, it was SO hot and humid we could hardly walk around. Then went to Boscovs, they we're having a HUGE sale. Got some great bargains for Xmas. Came home and was in bed by 6pm. I had my Xgeva shot on Thursday and it always makes me feel a little \"off\" and tired for a few days. Resting some today.

My short term disability pay stops next month and there may be a lag until my much reduced long term disability pay starts. We have tons of trash bags, toilet paper, tissues, shampoo, body wash etc. my sister in law who is a coupon user recently decided to stop using liquid laundry soap and only use pods. She gave me her stash of laundry soap, 12 bottles of various kinds. I'm grateful. I know exactly how you feel about the scans. My mind goes to a very dark place weeks before. I'm freaking out now because my tumor markers went up 15 points this time. Onc says redraw on the 20th if still elevated will have to scan.
