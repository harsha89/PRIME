Guess I was too optimistic about the sides.  I woke with aheadache from my ear    to half way down my arm.  One 20mg dialaudid helped greatly.  It\"s a waiting game for us I guess.  I am sorry about your heartburn.  Not only does it hurt but it keeps you awake at night.  Ask your Oncology Nurse about increasing your nexium.  So far one a day is good for me but  some of my chemo buddies take it three times a day..  Thank you for your prayers and know mine are comming right back to you and continued success with the sides.                                                                       Susan",

The cancer came back in 2006 in my bones, about six months after my beloved grandson TJ was born. The cancer is everywhere in my bones .  Spine, pelvis, ribs, head, shoulders, breast bone, collarbone, hips.  We discovered it because the pain got to be so bad that I couldn.t even lift my beautiful little 5 lb bundle of love.  Since then I have had radiation (which was a miracle for the pain)  and too many chemo drugs to list or remember. I had my first halaven today.so far no side effects.  I've had the neulasta before with no sides from it.  I hope this time will be the same.  I'm also on  a 50mg fentanyl patch and zometa once a month.  I have great support from my husband and sister.  They won't let me drive or go to any DR appts by myself. My sissy is so easy.  She carries and lifts everything.  I love her.I have also had almost 5 years of the most joyful and lovefilled time with my dearest TJ.  When he comes running into my house, yelling GAM..MY  I HE..AH  I completely forget my pain and am filled with so much love and joy for that little guy.We have developed quite a bond..I will stay in touch about whatever side effects develope.  Thank you all so much for your comments. They have given me hope and a good idea of what to expect.   Susan",
