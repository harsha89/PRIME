I mentioned this same lump and he said \" Oh are you going to be one of those patients?\" ..... Wow made me feel stupid.

It seems as though the people in my life are either burnt out on hearing about yet another problem or i have to comfort them. I truly hope this is just another blip and not a bump so to speak. Strange how we find comfort in others we don't even know. I won't go into detail about all my problems. I'm also waiting on an endometrial biopsy. Hopfully have those results on tuesday. I know this no matter what I am a fighter and I will put up a good fight... If needed.            ",
