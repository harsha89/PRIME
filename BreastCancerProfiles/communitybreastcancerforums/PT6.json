Initially, I was planning on immediate reconstruction then I got thinking about it. Why and for whom am I having reconstruction? If the world cannot deal with my battle scars, it is their problem not mine. As it turned out it was probably a good thing that I did not have TE implanted. I have developed a slight infection in the area and an rheumatoid arthritis flair so the presence of a foreign body wold not have been a good thing. Remember that you can always change your mind and have implants later. I had a R mx in 1978 and have used a prosthesis for 31 years without difficulty. I just thought that with nothing to stabilize the position of the bra I would end up with my foobs in the back. We'll see.",

I am scheduled to see the breast surgeon in 2 weeks but there is no question of what I am going to do - simple mastectomy / sentinal node evaluation/ immediate reconstruction (Note that I did not have reconstruction after my first mastecomtomy - so this will be a new experience. I will see a couple of surgeons and plastics people to decide who I want to treat me. This just sucks!!!!! You are never safe!!!!

I am a physical therapist and very active. I hate surgery and needles and decided against reconstruction. I returned to work with a prosthesis. As part of my adjustment to the situation I refused to use a mastectomy bra with a pocket so the prosthesis was sitting free in a regular bra. I was demonstrating a treatment technique to a new staff member who was also in his 20s and rather handsome. I leaned forward and to my horror felt the prosthesis slip. It landed in it's edge on the mat and started rolling - across the mat off the edge then continued rolling when it hit the floor. I was in hot pursuit. I grabbed the prosthesis and ran out the door to the nearest bathroom and replaced the prosthesis in my bra. To say the least, I always wear a bra with pocket now. I returned to what I was doing without saying a word. I have always wondered who witnessed this episode as the gym was busy though no one ever mentioned a thing. ",

SOOO I decided to visit the Foobie store to see what is new. I am still having some discomfort and swelling on the side of my recent surgery so I was going for the post surgery comfort stuff. They first tried the fiberfill \"softies\". I had tried to make these work with the post surgical cammi but the they had enough fill for a D and I am a B. I pulled out most of the stuffing and ended up with a crater in the middle. No amount of fluffing and puffing could make these things look like boobs. I did meet a friend for lunch and her diplomatic opinion was that they were a little large and high (slightly lower than my armpits, yeck!). I dispensed with the fake look for the summer and just wore T shirts with loose blouses (Thanks to the person who posted the pictures of the nothing look) . The ladies could not make the \"softies\" look any better than I did so onto these weird filled things. I left sporting a pair of filled temporary things. They are made out of the weird microstuff that they fill travel pillows with. You know - that weird scrunchy stuff. They look better than the softies but are hard and crunchy when I reach across my chest. Now this is better that the lumpy fiber fill or - as a last resort - I had used a kitchen scrunchy that I pulled apart and wadded up. - but I will sure feel better when I can use silicon foobs. That what I had before my surgery on the right and they felt amazingly \"normal\" to touch. Dx 4/10/2009, DCIS, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I woke up exhausted and think that the wierd dream was related to the darvocet so I'm trying to stick with Celebrex. Things seem to have gone smoothly. I now have the figure of a 10 year old - which is what I requested as I decided against reconstruction. I would really like to minimize the number of surgeries I must endure. I have rheumatoid arthritis in my jaw joint which limits my ability to open my mouth. As a result, the anesthesiologist informed me that I have to be intubated while AWAKE!!!!!!

Evidently, they give you something so you do not care what they do to you and then do not remember what happened. Yeah, modern medicine. I wish they had used that drug last time! It's really weird!

In fact, it looked so bad that they told me to wear a sweater or over shirt so it would not show. I hate this thing. Everytime I hit it when I reach across my chest it feels hard and icky. I am still using my old silicone prosthesis on the opposide and the difference is amazing. When I hit the silicone it feels natural - not the bean bag thing. Weight is not an issue when you are small breasted and if your insurance covers it, you should go for silicone. I just tried to trade the beany thing in for something more natural - remember that I was told that this was temporary until I healed. Unfortunately, they have now changed their tune and say that I cannot change it until I am eligible for a new prosthesis in a year!!!!!!!! They even charged my insurance over $350.00 for the thing!
