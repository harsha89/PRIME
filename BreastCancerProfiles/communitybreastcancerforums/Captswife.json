Expecting hair loss to start then. I had left mastectomy on 9/3 -they couldn't place the expander because I didn't have enough tissue left. I will have ovaries and right breast removed, after radiation therapy. I turn 41 on Saturday. I am married with 3 children 15, 13, and 9. I still feel like this is a bad dream. Is anyone here ILC?",
