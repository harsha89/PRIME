I have read elsewhere that for cancer it should be higher than 60. I need to take a lot of Vit. C. to keep my level above 40. Like 8000 units. I had some genetic testing done and found that I had the VDR gene - I am \"vitamin D resistant\" meaning that I don't make much of it from sun. (I also live in the north, and have mediterranean skin.) You need to have your levels checked regularly - because it is very individual as to how much you need. My oncologist told me not to take calcium - there are problems associated with calcium supplementation - not sure exactly what they are. Also - it is recommended that you take Vitamin K with the D - the Vitamin K allows calcium to go to your bones, not your arteries.",

It is this: Suppose my dad - who lived to be 93, and died peacefully without pain, in his 20s found out that he had the Chek2 mutation, and decided not to have children. I wouldn't exist. All the things I have done - my children - wouldn't have happened. And I've had a good life, despite getting cancer 3 years ago. The thing is, it isn't like one of those mutations, like cystic fibrosis, where the child often dies very young and goes through a lot of medical interventions along the way. Your children may or may not end up with the mutation. And even if they do have it, they may not develop cancer. And even if they do develop cancer, it isn't the end of the world, and can be dealt with and survived, often for long times. Best wishes that you come to some peace with this. Flavia",

I am 62 years old, diagnosed with breast cancer at 59. 3 years out I am cancer free and well. I must have gotten the chek2 gene from my dad's side - no cancer on my mom's. Dad had 3 siblings. Dad got prostate cancer at age 76 and died at age 93. His brother got prostate cancer and died in his late 80s. One of my dad's sisters got ovarian cancer and died at age 49. This was in 1962 and the treatments were terrible. The other aunt didn't get cancer. Other than my poor aunt who died young, my dad and his brother had wonderful lives. (And, I'll bet my aunt too had many wonderful years before her diagnosis.) We all have to die of something. Some people live longer lives than others. The Chek2 gene is not a death sentence, nor does it mean that you - or your children - can't have a wonderful life. I have 2 children, ages 32 and 24 and both in good health. I have encouraged them both to get tested, but so far, neither has. If they end up with the Chek2 gene and develop cancer in the future, I hope that today's and tomorrow's medical advances will make it a treatable blip on the radar. I think that even if the Chek2 gene makes you predisposed to getting cancer, that you can lead an anti-cancer lifestyle and maybe prevent or delay the onset of cancer. Best wishes to you.",

In my case, they told me that I was a high risk person due to the fibroadenoma, so I had frequent mammograms, usually every year. I had another fibroadenoma at age 46. Many times I needed extra pictures during the mammogram due to dense breasts. They did extra x-rays when they did a needle guided biopsy at age 46. I wonder how much all the x-rays contributed to my eventually developing cancer - or if it was just in the cards, and nothing I would do would change that destiny. I also wonder if I had checked my vitamin D levels and optimized them, and whether I had checked my iodine levels - if things would have been different.",

I'm doing ok.   Chemo sucked, but it ended.  Radiation wasn't that bad.  It is overwhelming, but it gets easier.  Best of luck to you.",

The problem is that they give Herceptin with more toxic drugs - I had the TCH combo. The Taxotere and Carboplatin were the things that gave me the terrible side effects. When I was on Herceptin alone, the side effects were negligible. I ended up needing the T and C at reduced dosages for my 4th - 6th treatments because I couldn't tolerate higher doses. If I had to do it over again, I would have asked for very minimal T and C doses. Apparently studies have shown that Herceptin works better when combined with the nasty stuff. Good luck to you!",

He stopped being able to walk. He went to his bed, in the assisted living facility, and hospice came in. He wore a diaper and had nurse's aides in throughout the day. He ate less and less, and finally refused food and water. He never wanted pain meds. He was pretty aware and lucid up until the last few days when he slept more and more. He just faded away. His breathing got shallower and shallower. Occasionally a few days before he died, he would have some kind of startle reflex, and would try to put his arms out like he wanted to get up, but that subsided, and he just slept more and more and finally just stopped breathing. He was 93. Mom lived with me for 8 years after dad died. She was an invalid who had a stroke, but she was mentally alert right up until almost the end. About 3 months before she died, she stopped being able to walk. She had used a walker, and was able to basically stand, turn around, and sit - to be able to use a commode or wheelchair. When this stopped, we got hospice in and a hospital bed. She wasn't on any medications or in any pain. She too just got sleepier and sleepier. She still had an appetite right up until the last few days. She had congestion in her lungs and ended up gasping for breath the last day or so. She was pretty unconscious, and didn't seem to be suffering. She was 95. The most wonderful and amazing thing happened the day before she died. She was pretty much in a coma, and I went in to check on her. She opened her eyes, had the most beautiful smile, and said \"George!\" - which was my dad's name. It seemed that she was with him and wanted to let me know. ",
