The 3rd one was at 90% and the fatigue set in a day earlier and stronger than before. Not looking forward to #4 at all. Then, I'm not sure what. The doctor is going to decide then. (I like to say he's just playing a guessing game with me, but really, I guess it is a good thing if he's keeping the options open.) I made the mistake(!) of asking what I could take for headaches since I was being cautious about tylenol due to the liver. That made him concerned, so he ordered a head CT to check for any tumors in there. I have the same type and kind of headaches that I have always had. Caffeine headaches, stress headaches (my MIL came for a visit), and once or twice a year a migraine. So, that test was on Friday. Quick and painless, and I suppose that it is good to rule out anything going on up there. But, if they find anything, I'm going to be seriously perturbed! Anyone following through with Halloween costumes this weekend? I bought a purple wig, but this is my bad weekend and I will be playing couch potato. naya985 I bet you could really freak out some people with your black tongue!

I have Thanksgiving week off, with Taxol to start the Monday after Thanksgiving. I had been doing Thursday chemo, so I hope I won't have to take days off for the Taxol. I might try to get it back to Thursdays during an \"off\" week. I'm cooking for Thanksgiving, too. About all the regular stuff, with the expectation that all my kids will be pitching in. I bought 2 turkey breasts rather than a full turkey to make it easier to pick. I plan on playing the \"Big C\" card, though, and getting someone else to do the picking. I hate that job, and if I get enough sympathy, someone else should be stepping in. :) Congrats to all those finishing chemo! I had surgery first, and even though it wasn't fun, the waiting was definitely the hardest part about it. Have a good weekend!",

I finally figured out that if I keep moving along at this pace, with 8 Taxols remaining plus 6 weeks of radiation, plus a total of 4 recovery weeks, I will be done on May 5th. My daughter's college graduation is May 6th. A little bit to close for comfort, so I asked to skip the next \"off\" week from Taxol, so we will see how that goes... Eyelashes and most of eyebrows fell out 2 weeks ago, but darn it! not all of my leg hairs! My hair loss is really not bothering me very much, as long as it stays temporary. If doesn't grow back well, then it will be a different story. But I won't worry about that now (so I tell myself). Back to work tomorrow after having company for Christmas. Happy new year!",

I wasn't having any particular problems, this is just the way the MO likes to do the Taxol, I believe. The nurse did comment that after my break week, all of my blood work was good. Not \"kinda low, but ok\", but actually within the range they are all supposed to be. I felt some better, but not as good as I expected to feel. My 4 weeks off that I was counting were 2 break weeks, and then 2 weeks in between chemo and radiation. That leaves no extra time at all, and takes me to May 5th, one day before graduation. Hopefully skipping the break week won't mess me up healthwise. My tumor markers were going up, so the MO ordered a PET scan, which the insurance denied. I found out after fasting for 6 hours and arriving at the scheduled time. (grrr.) Then the doctor's office got notice that I had the test anyway, even though the insurance denied it, which I DID NOT. Hopefully just a glitch in the system, but now that's another bill to watch out for. Now I will be getting a CT scan next week, instead. I am happy I have insurance. I AM happy I have insurance. I am HAPPY I have insurance. Just bought a felt tip eyeliner to go along with my false eyelashes. I wear them about once a week, but they need some help. And I might break out my removable eyebrow tatoos. Haven't tried them yet, but have hardly any eyebrows left, so it might be time. I must say, that as much as I look forward to having hair again, I'm going to miss the quick showers. And the quickness of getting ready. I guess it's a taste of what it feels like to be a guy. :)",

I shocked him yesterday--I told him I lost my eyebrows. I meant my eyebrow tatoos, but he thought my actual eyebrows had fallen out already. He felt so bad for me, and for the fact that he hadn't even noticed, that he shed a few tears. Signs of things to come, I guess.

Ovaries: I managed to have a hysterectomy 2 days after my breast biopsies and 5 days before cancer diagnosis. (At the time, it seemed like the biggest thing I was doing.

However, the MO still put me on Letrozole for the next ten years due to estrogen still being produced in our adrenal glands. And that is what caused my liver enzymes to skyrocket. So, I guess I will be on something like that for 10 years, but hopefully not THAT. I'm on day 5 of Chemo #1, and I'm hating all smells. Every one. Garbage, cooking eggs, air fresheners, bananas, soap. You name it. Also, my ears seemed super sensitive to sound last night. And, mostly because of the hysterectomy, I assume, I am having a gazillion hot flashes every day. And they seem worse after chemo. How am I going to keep anything on my head if I'm pouring sweat?

My MO was incredibly supportive when I told him in a recent visit. I like him even better, now. Did anyone have a PET scan after treatment was done? My insurance denied it as being unnecessary. Huh. I will be having a CT scan soon, though, to check on the lung nodule that was nothing and they want to make sure that it stays nothing. I still have my port. Not sure how much longer, but since I have so many other things going on it's not as important anymore. I have swelling in my fingers, so I had an evaluation for lymphodema. They determined that it wasn't that (and were happy about how proactive I was about getting there so quickly.) Next will be a stop to the rheumotologist to see if I have RA. My hair is still purple, although it is due for a touch up. The hair in the middle front is still not growing very quickly, but otherwise I've been very happy with the way it has grown in. I may even keep it this short for awhile longer. It is just so easy to take care of. Nice talking to you, ladies!",

I usually host it and cook all the food. (My dad and brother come, and my kids all come home, so there's not a very good option to go to someone else's house.) Went to a fabric store over the weekend and bought 2 knit fabrics to hopefully make a couple more wraps. One of the ones I bought is just a tube sewed together with one seam. The ends weren't even finished. I figure I can certainly do that, and the two fabrics together only cost around $6. But I also paid for it by listening to a couple of chemo stories since the lady behind the counter wanted to know what I was making. I didn't tell her it was for me, and she was very nice, but I still don't really want to hear stories everywhere I go. Which was why I thought about a wig, but I'm also a non-hat or anything person and don't think I can handle a wig. Take care, everyone!",

My tumor markers were trending up, so he ordered a PET scan (which insurance denied and I didn't find out about until I was standing at check-in) so then he ordered at CT scan. Hopefully that's what your MO is doing. Since you noticed the line/crease thing it would ease your mind much more to find out for sure that it's nothing, rather than them telling you that they will watch it for now and then test later. I would just assume it's nothing and try to focus on that, and worry other things later. (Easy to say, hard to do, I know...)

Yikes! That is really my worst symptom other than the queasiness. Hot flashes all day and night. Also, I accidently licked my lips after doing some sweating and yuck! That tasted like poison.

However, that was before any BC stuff, and I was healthy and hadn't had any abdominal surgeries like you. Still, it was a good experience. Make sure you ask for the anti-nausea meds and get them BEFORE the surgery so they have time to kick in, if you have those kinds of problems with anesthesia. I got set up with rides to and from chemo next week for my first Taxol treatment. They will be giving me Benadryl, and I'm not sure how I will handle it. Well, I'm pretty sure I will be dopey. I can't handle the over-the-counter version very well. Has anyone been affected by that? How long were you out of it?",

It seems like I'm just slogging along, but I didn't really get behind anywhere, it's just the way it is... My surgeon says she removes my port when the MO says to, and he doesn't typically take it out until after the 6 month after PET scan, and sometimes he leaves it in for a year. Uggh. I guess that is better than taking it out too early and needing it again, but it seems like just such a looong time. It's a good thing my surgeon buried it deep enough that it isn't very noticible. Had a CT scan on Weds, due to my tumor markers trending up. Getting onto the hospital portal and reading the report (because who knows how long it will take to see the MO), it looks like everything is fine. Wonderful words were there...stable...unremarkable...normal... LOVE the hair pics! I too, have a bit of peach fuzz going on. Misslil, I LOLed at your comment...my hair is trying, too!",

And I'm also experiencing it myself. It's like peach fuzz and very fine. I do notice every few days that it is getting darker looking. I have taken my pic a couple of times to send to my daughter, and when I look back at them I can tell the difference from week to week. If you haven't done that you might want to. It makes me feel good to look back and see that I'm making some progress. There's a post somewhere here (forget the name or which forum ) where a lady posted her photos from week to week for about half the year. It's very encouraging to look at. Especially at the top, which looks like it takes longer to come in, just like mine. I looked around in church today and noticed a guy who just shaved his head and thought, \"Ha! My hair is longer than yours!!!\"",
