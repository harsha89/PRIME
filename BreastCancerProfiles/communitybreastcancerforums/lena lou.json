I know that Johns Hopkins has a 2nd opinion service for out of town patients where you can FedEx your pathology slides, etc. and they give you a very quick turnaround.  I think there is a button for out-of-town patients on their website.  I sympathize with being in a very rural area -- this was my mom's situation and I persuaded her to move temporarily near Baltimore to get tx.   I know that may not be as doable for you with your kids, but at least a 2nd opinion might give you reassurance. I also agree with those who said your onc should be able to suggest some methods to reduce S/Es, like maybe a dose reduction. Best of luck!",

Lilyrose, congrats on being 1/3 of the way through Taxol! JBokland, my tumor may be bigger too -- at this point they are just guesstimating from the imaging.  My surgeon said the lobular kind is often more extensive once they get in there. MommyQ, that's awesome that you enjoyed the pho -- can't wait for my tastebuds to get normal.  And hooray for the lump just being fluid! Clarrn, did you have low white blood cell counts?  I did too -- ended up in the hospital with neutropenic fevers on my first 2 rounds of A/C, then they reduced the dose by 25% and put me on Cipro.  That seems to have worked. Longislandl8y, have a good weekend with your little dog - he sounds like a sweetie!  We have a little white poodle mix named Star who may be about the same size. Linda505, I loved your story about the Tampa Bay Bucs!  Very touching, and a classy thing to do.   Golfingirl, you look great!  I hope the nausea and muscle pains are leaving you alone now. Footballnut, good job working out - 40 mins on the treadmill is awesome!  I have tried to keep to my exercise routine too but I've definitely had to cut back.  I totally get obsessing about things like your nail -- I do the same and it almost always turns out to be nothing.  I agree that your dermatologist should get you in early so you don't have to stress about it! ColdinCanada, so glad to hear you got some good sleep.  How old are your babies? SharonDe, that photo of your dog's fatigue is too cute!!  I feel the same way.  :-)  I am here at the beach with my husband, MIL, and 3 kids.  I have spent a lot more time in the rental condo sleeping than on the beach or at the pool, but I'm glad my kids are having fun since they had to miss out on a couple of other trips due to my diagnosis.  I have felt like I stand out when I do go to the beach or pool because I'm wearing a cap and weird tops to cover up my port, etc.  Truth be told, no one is probably paying any attention.  :)",

And to be honest I didn't start chemo until May. Just let me know and I will start a new thread if you prefer. I am having chemo before surgery since my tumor is big and near the chest wall. I also have at least one positive node as that is how I found my bc in the first place (lump in armpit). I have had 4 rounds of A\\C and start 12 weekly Taxols next week. swissmiss, I also have had a nagging cough! It may be a chemo thing as I overheard a woman getting chemo next to me complain about hers too.",

ColdinCanada, my \"babies\" are 7, 6, and 4.  And I am 47, an old mom.  My oldest is my bio child and my younger two were adopted.  I hear you on feeling like a pill-popper -- I have one of those little day-of-the-week pill organizers that is mostly for my OTC medication.   Thanks for your encouraging words - I am glad the light is coming for you soon with the end of chemo!  I hope you will share what your New Normal is like! Brigadoon, I really like the quote in your siggy (is that what they are called on these boards?)  I'm sorry for the bone pain and hope it eases soon. MsCaruso, I am also an obsessor.  I'm glad you will be getting all your questions answered soon. Footballnut, so sorry to hear about the digestive problems!  I have been constipated since starting chemo and if it weren't for stool softeners, I would never go.    Mompr, Are you taking dexomethosone (sp?)?  The nurse practitioner in my MO's office said that could cause spaciness and she had me cut the dose for my 2nd cycle since my nausea wasn't too bad.  You look beautiful, and so does your daughter! Jbokland and MommyQ, thanks for the good beach wishes.  I think it was healing since now I am back home with a good energy level. Wendy, glad to see you on this board!  Embarrassing confession - when I was first looking for a monthly chemo group to join, I could not find any except for the April group.  Now I see there are several. Chemo brain has definitely affected me. Clarrn, what a beautiful beach!   Timbuktu and Lilyrose, sorry to hear you have had digestive problems too.   We came back from the beach today.  I was happy to be home and had decent energy, enough to get a lot of laundry done and things unpacked.  I also had a good appetite this evening, which is unusual -- I have had very little appetite since starting chemo.  I do seem to be losing my eyelashes.  The ones on the bottom started falling out first.  The hair on my head has not all fallen out - I still have probably 10-20% of it as stubble.  So maybe I will keep a few eyelashes too?  Hard to say! Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend as much as possible.",

Today I came into the office.  Had a chill on the way and I ran the heater and waited in the parking lot til I wasn't shivering and now I am here sweating.  My poor colleagues, LOL.  Not sure how long I will last today as I feel completely wiped out.  Walking across the parking lot had me panting. jbokland, no, I am not doing icing.  My nurse said they don't believe it usually works, though I am welcome to try it.  I had such a chill last time I was there, there was no way I was putting any body part on ice! :-)   Did you do it and do you think it helps?",

Linda505, I'm so sorry you have job worries on top of everything.  That is not fair.  Hope things are looking a little better. Jaimeeh, are you at Hopkins by chance?  (I understand if you don't want to get that detailed in a public forum!)  I only ask because I love my MO too.  And my mom loved hers. Footballnut, sounds like you got some true compassionate care from your nurse - so glad to hear it.  And glad you are feeling well enough to exercise -- I'm sure that will help everything! Jbokland, my top eyelashes have only fallen out on one side so I have that same awesome look, LOL. Jhodro, can't imagine from your profile photo you being taken for a grandma.  I had the same experience with the teenage clerk when picking up some donuts for my kids (no, not my grandkids!) at the beach.  Teenagers can be so clueless.  At least she felt embarrassed about it. ColdinCanada, congrats on your new car!  That is awesome! Hollyhope, I had heard that bc patients sometimes have a tough emotional reaction when they get done with tx.  I could see that, because we are so focused on getting better and getting through tx, that we may not have time to process our emotions about it.  Hope you are feeling better. Everforward, yay for a sister visit!  My mom and sister have both visited from across the country and it has helped a lot. Sorry for being MIA.  I had my first Taxol on Thursday and thought everything was okay, but no, I guess that was just the steroids talking!  On Sat. I spiked a high fever and it has pretty much been going up and down since then.  I went to urgent care on Sat., and spent the night in the ER on Sunday, and all the bloodwork shows normal.  I am finally back to work today but promised my onco nurse I would call if the fever spiked while on Tylenol.  Sitting here looking at 102 (down from 103 30 minutes ago -- it is dropping fast.)  Trying to rationalize not calling yet . . .   Just don't want to deal with the disruption to our lives -- we have 3 little kids so we have to impose on our friends, etc., just to go in and wait around for bloodwork.  I saw online that fevers, chills and body aches can be a normal side effect of Taxol -- has anyone experienced that?",

Tomorrow I go see my oncologist to see what his plan is for getting me through my last 10 cycles of Taxol without killing me off with side effects.   Congrats to those who have finished or are finishing up - you are inspiring.  And so is everyone else who keeps posting about how you are plugging away and keeping moving forward despite all the difficulties.",

Jamieh, we are neighbors - I am also in MD, in Silver Spring.  I am starting Taxol Thursday so can't answer your question but have some very unattractive stubble left over from the A/C.  Your head looks much more attractive! Everforward, we are also neighbors.  So glad you had a wonderful time at the spa!  You sound like you have a better attitude and are so much braver than me.  No one outside my family has seen my bald head yet. Jbokland, hooray for getting your port removed!  I am looking forward to that day. ColdinCanada, hmmm, I guess needing to shave your legs again is something to celebrate, lol. Everyone else, I am sending you good wishes. I am starting Taxol on Thursday and will have it weekly for 12 weeks unless the s/es are too bad.  Then I have to decide if I am going to join a clinical trial to do radiation with an experimental drug BEFORE surgery.  My surgeon says no because operating on irradiated skin leads to wound healing complications, plus he will not be able to do the nipple-sparing surgery I was so hoping for.  The MO and RO say it MAY give more protection against recurrence, but of course there is hardly any research because it is a clinical trial.  Sigh.  I just wish someone would tell me what to do.",
