Yesterday, she had bloodwork done and some sort of body scan that took an hour and a half. I think she is scheduled for additional testing on Monday. No surgery has been scheduled, and the doctor has not given her much information. How come that much testing is involved?",

I'm not sure how he concluded that. I'm just scared for my mom!",

My mom was recently diagnosed, and she has been to the hospital twice since for extensive testing. She went yesterday, and we all thought the doctor was going to provide a treatment plan, but she went through additional testing. She is scheduled for even more testing next Monday. Is this normal? Did you all get many tests before being presented with a treatment plan/staging information? Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",
