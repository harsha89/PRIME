Pretty much only on the right side and last for about 14 days then calms down for a week or so. Feels exactly like engorgment when breast feeding. So we scheduled a mammo for after my 40th to make sure insurance would cover it. So I went Wednesday for 3D mammo. I told her about the breast pain and she started. Friday morning I recieved a call from my doctor stating they want to schedule me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. I got the report on my patient portal and it reads: Focal asymmetry with associated calcifications on upper outer aspect of right breast, middle depth. Technique: bilateral CC and MLO views were obtained using digital technique and applying CAD. A right XCCL view was also acquired. Breast composition: scattered areas of fibroglandular density. So now I am scheduled for this on Wednesday and I am thinking back, I have had spontaneous discharge from that breast during the times I have been in pain, but only random dots here and there from one spot.
