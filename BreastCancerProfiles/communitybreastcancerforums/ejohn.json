We think she had a bad reaction from the stuff you drink or the dye they give you for the CT scan. She has had diarra and has been throwing up so bad and her stomach is hurting her really bad. She said the pain actually feels like it's in her liver area. She's worried her liver is eat up with cancer and that's what is causing all of this, but she was fine this morning. Has anyone ever had a reaction like this from CT scans? My mom has had them done before and never had one to effect her like this. I've never seen her this sick. She was fine before she had the CT scan this morning that's why I believe all of this has to be coming from that CT scan.  I'm really worrying about her, she's home right now, but I might have to take her to the ER.  Has anyone had this happen before?    Michelle Log in to post a reply",

They gave her IV fluids, and some nashua medicine, but she is still feeling bad. Her wbc counts are high. They did a lot of blood work on her to see if she has an infection--won't know anything from that for a couple of days though.  She was supposed to get Chemo tomorrow, but will have to wait until Friday now.  It just seems so strange to me that she got this sick right after the CT scan. Right after she had it done she could hardly talk. They kept her there for about an hour because she was having a hard time talking to monitor her, they did give her benadryl to take and thought she would be fine so they sent her home. After she got home that's when she got so sick to her stomach.  My mom says she will be scared now to ever do another CT scan. She is still so weak.  We also got the report today from the CT scan. My mom has had two spots on her liver for about 11 months now and now one of the spots has decreased in size and the other one is stable, but a new spot has showed up also now--making it 3 spots on the liver. The doctor told us the report was actually pretty good. But we asked to see the CT report and that's when I found out about this new spot that has showed up. So I asked him about it and he told me that he isn't sure if that new spot is cancer. He said it doesn't make sense to him that the other two would have decreased in size and that a new one has showed up. So I hope he's right. Does this sound right?  Can new spots grow and show up in the liver while other ones decrease?       ",

Her lungs still look okay with no tumors showing up there. But what has me so worried is how bad my mom feels all the time. Today she is going for a bone scan. Her right leg swells all the time and it hurts her really bad most of the time. She can't take any pain medication because they all make her so sick. She can't do a lot of walking anymore either. It getting harder for her to get up and down also. My mom had radiation to her leg but it didn't help her any. It actually I think made things worst. Now she has Lymphedema in her right leg which the doctor said came from the radiation treatments. The pain is still really bad in that leg. She goes for her 9th treatment of Taxotere Wednesday and that worries me because with every treatment now it seems to bring her down even more. She is also taking Zometa. She stays so tired all the time and it takes her longer and longer with each Chemo treatment to bounce back. My mom is ER+ PR- and Her2 positive. I don't know what to think of all of this. Even though the CT scans of her abdomen and Chest look okay I don't know if it's really good news or not since she feels so bad all the time. Maybe this bone scan will tell us more. My mom was so full of life last year. She's really gone back in the last year since she was diagnosed with bone and liver mets. Log in to post a reply",

I'm really scared. Is this a sign of brain mets, being off balanced? It just started up about a week or so ago. She stumbles a lot. But she also takes Gabapentin for pain that's a seizure drug, but she takes that to help out with her bone mets pain. She increased that pill last week so I wonder if that could be the reason she's off balanced? Most likely we won't know the test results of the MRI until her next Doctor's appointment which will be next Wednesday. The waiting is so tough, I wish we could find out the results tomorrow or by Friday, but her doctor isn't in on Friday so I doubt we will. I'm just really scared right now. Her bone and liver scans looked pretty good last month I was feeling so good about that and now all of this is happening.

I'm worried the cancer is getting worst. She doesn't have an appetite and even throws up sometimes after she eats.  Her sugar has been high lately also don't know why.  This just started up after her back surgery.  She never had diabetes before. But last night I checked her sugar with my dad's meter and it was 201 and sometimes it's been as high as 350.  Her blood pressure is low also but her pulse rate is really high 127. I don't know what's going on with her.  I tried to call the doctor but couldn't get an appointment before Wednesday morning.  All she wants to do today is sleep. I'm really worried.  My mom did so well the first 2 weeks after surgery but since then has been going down so it seems.   Log in to post a reply",

I hope nothing is really wrong and that she can get the Avastin along with Taxol next week.   Also wondering if the side effects from these two drugs are really bad?  Taxotere put her in the hospital a couple of times in the beginning.  Michelle Log in to post a reply",

She's on Taxol and Avastin.  With this last chemo treatment after about the 4 day she started having really bad bone pains.  The doctor has put her on Morphine for the pain, but it makes her so sick and she can hardly keep anything down.  Her hands and legs hurt her the most, it's so hard seeing her in pain like this.  This is her 4th treatment with taxol and avastin.  Does the side effects get worst with every treatment?  The first couple of treatments didn't seem that bad. Also Is there anything else that works good for pain that might not make her as sick?         Log in to post a reply",
