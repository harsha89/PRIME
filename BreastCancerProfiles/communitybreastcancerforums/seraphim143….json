By the time I went to my mammo and ultrasound appointment 2 days later it was clearly visible. In the office he removed almost 8 cc of dark brown fluid into a syringe and sent to pathology. I was relieved to see the results as \"old apocrine cells\", or dead fat cells. Eventually that cysts decreased some and I still feel the casing with some fluid flattened out somewhat... among the many others in my left breast that were not there before. As with any lump, bump or change its best to get it checked out and call the office. My doctor warned me it would probably come back even though he drained it :-( I hope you are doing well by now.",
