Good luck!   ",

I know that at times, my friend has used other products on her hair and certainly it didn't fall out, she just felt it didn't look as full and thick as it does when she uses the Nioxin.  She uses the shampoo also.  Sorry to say I haven't had the need to use shampoo for several months now. I certainly can't say for sure whether it helps, but I am proud to say that my son told me today, \"Your hair is coming in nicely, Mom.\"  He cracks me up and makes me feel great.  Again, I don't know if it helps, but it doesn't seem to be hurting.  There are other suggestions on the board for what might help with hair growth.  I will also admit that periodically, I rub it on where my eyebrows used to be!  Hoping those come back soon!",
