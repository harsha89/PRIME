I had a core biopsy on Thursday and didn't feel a thing!  After reading your post I asked several different friends their opinion on why some people experience pain, while others don't.  Most people say it's the physician's lack of skill.  Others said perhaps it has something to do with the location of the lump?  I don't know I'm just speculating.  Personally I don't think any physician should let their patient suffer like that.  It's very uncaring.  There are too many ways to sedate someone for anyone to have to be in that sort of pain, short of an emergency situation when there's no time to wait.  One woman told me her doctor gave her valium before the biopsy.  Your doc could have at least done that.  My opinion - ask the doctor why you experienced such pain when the majority of women do not experience any pain.  If he/she can't answer your question to your satisfaction - I'd be looking for another doctor.  My prayers are with you!",
