But each week between those two dates felt like an eternity. I understand exactly how you feel, and I'm just so sorry you're dealing with this. I think once you have gathered all the information and have a plan of treatment, it'll be easier to tell the kids. I started by saying, \"This is going to sound scary, but everything is going to be fine.\" My son was home from college when I told him the day after Thanksgiving. Sending you a cyber hug. Hang in there.",

Gave me headphones with piano music playing and talked to me at the start of each scan to tell me how long it would last. I had my MRI done the Monday before Thanksgiving, and the results were back the Saturday after. St Joseph Women Hospital is awesome.",
