A couple weeks ago I noticed a small pea sized lump on the top of my left breast. It is hard and doesn't move. As it had been over 2 years since my last mammogram, I made an appointment for a \"screening mammogram\" as there is no copay and I figured if there was any concern, that would pick it up. I did not mention that I had found this lump. I had the mammo 2 days ago and they called and said it was normal. Now I am kicking myself because I am still concerned and the lump appears either slightly bigger or more easy to find than it was before. Have any of you had similar situations that turned out to be cancer...i.e.: post menopausal, no pain, just a hard non moving lump. I am also overweight and not very active. I know I need to get in to see my Dr. But I am afraid he won't check into it due to the normal mammo this week. Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated. Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",
