I hated that the radiologist said \"bad\" when he was describing I had an abnormality. Isn't that redundant? Invasive mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features, 1.2 cm maximal length. In situ carcinoma with ductal and lobular features also present. That's about it. Shouldn't there be more?? I also hate that the primary doctor decided it was best to tell me Friday afternoon before Memorial Day so I could just stew in my fears and dread before I could do anything but read horror stories and its gonna be alright stories that did extremely little to releive me of the anxiety. So, as most, probably all, say, I don't want to do this. I really don't want to do this. I don't know how to tell my extremely health conscience 83 year old mother, who lives with me, my two teenaged kids who maybe depend on me a little more than a lot of teenagers do on their mother. We are all close, mostly because, I believe, the trama of the rug being pulled out from under us when their father, my husband of 24 years decided to up and leave for one of our much younger employees. That was 8 years ago. Business down the tubes, me having to find a new career and now having to deal with this asshole that used to be my husband. But I regress... I have 3 BS appointments lined up in a couple of days. 2 in NYC and one in the boonies where I live. OK, here are some questions: When do you get all that other info like the hormone stuff and such.? In reading others posts, they seems to have a lot more info. When does the oncologist come in? My arm next to my bad boobies kind of aches. On the top part, facing out, like below my shoulder. Is this related? Everyone who felt me so far can't feel any swelling of my nodes....that's good, they say. Yeah, we'll see. Am I destined for chemo? My friend just had a double mastectomy, reconstruction at the same time, no radiation, no chemo. Sounds too good to be true....unlike my experience with life so far. Hahaha and when we were younger, in college, she always said I lived a charmed life!! ...Jinx!! Why is everyone so nonchalant about the hair loss?? I mean that, AND the boobie loss??...OMFG!! They are my best physical features and i love all of them!! And I'm gonna have to go to work thru this?? Hard enough doing my job. Sometimes I think death is better than being carved up, sick and living with cancer. I mean everything dies eventually.... Finally, Mom, can I get that puppy now?

It's nice to get it simply explained after reading so much technical stuff that I'm so unfamiliar with. I very much apprciate it. I don't see any of the hormone info on my report. I know most don't take hair and breast loss lightly. I am just very angry and have a hard time accepting it. I still haven't fully accepted that I'm a divorced woman/single mom. Up until now that was the nightmare I was trying to wake up from. Thank you again for the response. Again, I truly appreciate it!!",

I haven't seen those people since the beginning of July after working there for 8 years without more than a week or so off at a time. I work for a pretty good size resort with a lot of employees. I didn't tell anyone but 3 people why I was taking leave. Oh boy, I'm not prepared for the questions! My daughter says to make up stuff like the lottery money finally ran out, or I was abducted by aliens, or I was in the witness protection program, I went to live among the penguins.....we were having a lot of fun making stuff up during the car ride to the city today!

It kind of worries me starting a drug and being out if the country. Crap. Thanks for the estrogen lesson too! Great information!! I was doing very, very well on weight watchers before diagnosis but fell off the wagon and weight has been creeping back. I have about 30 lbs to loose. I don't have the enthusiasm to go back yet.

Since the took so many axil nodes from my armpit and 27 were neg I guess I don't have much left in there and RO says he doesn't want to do my subclavical because of so many neg nodes were taken already. Fine with me. Idk, I have a different mindset than a lot of women I read on here. I don't really believe all these docs know what they are doing and just throw anything they got at us without knowing if it will work or not. Everything is based on statistics of reoccurance and as we see everyone is different. Rads are not like surgery were they are actually removing cancer they know is there. Nobody can tell me if there are cancer cells floating around me and if they are where they are shooting this radiation beam or not. That bothers me. But anyway, sorry for that little rant.

If that node is positive, then neoadjuvant chemo, hoping to clear this node and possibly reduce the tumor...but more importantly clear the nodes so as not to have to take them out. If the node comes back clear, then a lumpectomy with SNB. He was also not a big fan of MRI's unless we are doing the neoadjuvant treatment because then we can see before and after treatment. He made a lot of sense but here's the problem, I hated that place. Everything about it. I liked BS #3 and everything about that place! I'm scheduled for the FNA of the axill node Wednesday and an MRI Thursday. I'm going to call back Dr #3 tomorrow and see what she says after I explain DR #4's opinion. Just to let you know the 4 opinions I got were all in NY; #1- Weill Cornell, #2-local doc who was trained at MSK, #3-NY University Langone, #4-Memorial Slone Kettering.

She said I have enough breast tissue that it won't be so noticeable. My ILC lump is around 3-4 cm. She wants me to go for an MRI to check nodes and anywhere else. I had a suspicious node on the sonogram that wasn't biopsied yet. She said if the node was still suspicious she would remove it at the same time as the lumpetomy. If it doesn't show up in the MRI then she would do the dye and a sentinel node biopsy. Then radiation, them possibly chemo and hormonal therapy since I'm positive with the hormone receptors. Now the second breast surgeon I saw today, a local guy, but came from NYC centers, says \"wow, why didn't the do a biopsy on the node when they did the lump since they flagged it as suspicious?\" Yeah, why didn't they?? Anyway, he says I am a perfect candidate for neoadjuvent treatment. He says I will have to go through chemo anyway, why not shrink the tumor before its removed so as to take less mass of tissue. He thinks if its taken out now it will leave a void and be noticeable. I would also have more time to decide if i want to go with the lumpectomy way or mastectomy instead of jumping right into surgery. He wants me to get the node biopsied and an MRI too. OK, so two different opinion's. Yay. Any comments from you ladies would be much appreciated. I do have one more BS to see tomorrow. I'm dying to see what she says!

She explained that my hormone positive status do not make sense to do the neoadjuvent therapy since this cancer does not respond well to it. She also gave me the hope that i at just have to do radiation and hormone therapy.... Possibly No chemo? I am terrified of chemo. But this glimmer of hope make this even worse because now that I have it and its taken away, torture is all I can say. She is also not a big fan of an MRI for me. She wants a FNA of the suspicious node. She sent me to a plastic surgeon to discuss my cosmetic options since she would be removing a fairly large amount of tissue in a lumpectomy. Any thoughts on this 3 and totally different opinion?",

She said the US and biopsy report don't agree on the size and the MRI would give a better picture. She prob wants to see that suspicious node too. My ER and PR are 90% positive. She said that was good. What I don't understand is if the high percentage hormone reseotor status doesn't respond we to chemo then why have it at all? Arr e the little escapees that might be floating around in my body the same cells as the tumor?",
