      "Content": "Benotto wrote: I had experienced bloody discharge from my left nipple and had an ultrasound guided biopsy on 3/1.  The biopsy didn't show anything cancerous (dense fibrous breast tissue), but it also didn't show a papilloma or other reason for the bleeding.  The surgeon I met with last week is assuming the biopsy missed the mass; I am scheduled for a lumpectomy next Wednesday 3/21. Unfortunately, I couldn't leave well enough alone and checked myself in the shower this morning.  I noticed bleeding from a second duct.  Oops!  I phoned the surgeon and she has scheduled a follow-up ultrasound/mammogram the day after tomorrow.  She says she intends to remove the second duct regardless, but wants to see what's changed in the past 2-3 weeks.  (Radiology report from three weeks ago:  Hypoechoic area of duct ectasia containing probable debris)  I, of course, am in a panic.  Whatever I've found about bloody discharge has said it's 'probably nothing' if it is just the one duct, so what does it mean if there is suddenly a second?  Log in to post a reply",

I'm very grateful for the information and support on sites like this!",

I do have a question concerning my ultrasound, though.  I had an ultrasound last week showing the second bloody duct, but yesterday they determined it was a second branch of the same duct.  I totally get that, if it has branched into a 'Y', squeezing on opposite sides of the breast would cause bleeding from the one duct.  What I don't understand, and am kicking myself for not pushing for more of an explanation yesterday, is that the discharge was coming out of two entirely separate places on the surface:  When I pressed on the right side, discharge from the right side of the nipple.  When I gave the left a squeeze, blood came from the other corner.  Even if I were brave enough to rough myself up, at this point everything is under dressings for another 48 hours. Can one duct lead to two separate openings on the surface?  Maybe I'm just missing a step in the anatomy here.",
