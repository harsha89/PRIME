I am like you above, I play tennis hard twice a week walk and walk go to spin class but I will be just sitting or laying and all of sudden bad pain in feet knees, and sometimes tibia. I get scared but know it is unlikely mets. I can't attribute to an AI because they took me off 2 months ago and it just actually feels worse. After sitting my feet actually feel like they are burning, when I get up I feel crippleds. Help I am only 44. My hips are sore but had several MRI's all clean. It is just really my feet and lower legs and knees. Whats up with this, what helps and what can be done?",

The problem is they show the effect of chemo on that tumor and it is not correct as they use a form of FAC/chemo to demonstrate effectiveness and that does not work on Her2 tumors. In addition they have not incorporated Herceptin into the equation which I think is a bit behind the times. Speaking from someone that has been through it I think it is a waste of money for Her2 node negs as you can see the data on the Her2 Joint analysis and it will give you a much better picture. I am sure some may disagree and just know this is my opinion.",

(plus I love this thread great ladies here) My StepMom is in her 17th year now after surviving stage 3. She had 4 nodes and she had AC, Tamox for 7 years, then Femara for 6. She is doing great. Her Sister is in her 26th year after dx for stage 3 BC, she thought she was going to die had 9 positive nodes and back then there was no Hormonals. She had double MX and 7  months of chemo, she is doing wonderfully. They are both in their 60's and the one thing they have in common is they both really committed to daily exercise and have not given it up. My Stepmom walks at least 3 miles per day.  I know a lot more long term survivors but wanted to give you the one's that I knew best. It is easy to come here and see a lot of bad news but thats why we are on these boards most of the time is to deal with anxieties that this disease brings, so the news will be of an anxious nature. BUt believe that there is a lot of good news out there too. Lago- this is what I have learned about Her2 through many studies and from my 2 Onc's one who is nationally renown and has worked with Slamon. He states that with her2 there are cancers being cured due to the molecular nature of Herceptin. (again we are not sure which ones) However if you have a grade 3 highly aggressive Her2 cancer with a high +3 Her2 grade confirmed by FISH and IHC, you can be cured with Herceptin. He went to the BC symposium in Dec where Slamon spoke and on the 10 year data there is still a lower level of recurrence. And they believe if a grade 3 Her2 cancer has not recurred at 10 years it most likely wont, similar to trip neg. HOWEVER there are no guarantees and no way to know if you were \"cured\". I guess what I am trying to say is you may be able to be cured but you don't know it and beyond that statement there is HOPE on the horizon. ",

From what I understand LVI means the tumor was on the move and there may me some presence of cells in the vascular walls so could have been passed in the blood. I am sure someone will come along with much more knowledge of LVI that can help. I agree get a 2nd opinion. You can also do a phone consult with some of the top docs in the US, I got a 3rd opinion from UCLA and only had to send my films and test results and schedule a phone consult.

Breast Cancer is not \"incurable\" some are cured some are not. I guess I am unsure why posters wish to come on this particular thread and state all BC is NOT curable when the literature proves otherwise. Like Lowrider states it may be a gray area and a matter of semantics but one indisputable fact is some BC's (types and stages) are curable. End of statement, there is really no interpretation on that statement.   ",

(so I don't have my head in the sand) I hope I didn't offend with my post and if so I apologize, obviously semantics can be interpreted many ways. However I did not mean to imply that there is a overall \"cure\" to bc.... you are right women are going to die of BC.  What I intended to say in my post was that there are those with BC that will not have it return and many view  that as they have been cured. My Onc who is nationally respected at a teaching hospital states the same as Dr. Love, we do cure BC in some cases with surgery, and some times with chemo, however we don't know of that cure until she dies of something else. I think we need to let women out there know that there is hope that they may not have a recurrence and in some cases their BC has been cured. It sucks to have that question mark hang over your head your whole life but in many cases it has allowed many to find more value in life knowing there is that question mark. In the end it is all semantics but I will tell you that in the literature and research papers and Many Oncs will tell you that statistically 60-65 percent of BC is cured and that number is rising. Cure, Remission for years until you are die of something else, whatever word you want to use it means the same thing in the end. Annie thank you for your wonderful post! ",

Some small cancers that have not yet travelled to the lymph or vascular system can be removed surgically. Many researchers are also stating that some of the molecular chemos, such as Herceptin can also offer a cure, Of course it has not been around long enough to prove otherwise but Herceptin does offer death pathways for any remaining cells. Also the thought that highly aggressive BC's (ie Her2 and Triple neg) that don't recur after 5 -8 years are thought to be \"cured\" per both of my Oncologists.

      "Content": "Sep 29, 2010 05:27AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 07:20PM by mmm5 Lowrider  I am sorry that you feel that this is a personal issue, you keep quoting issues from you own experience, and I have read many of your posts and you seem to be a great lady that gives great support and comfort. This issue (this particular thread) is not an emotional one for me, (that is it is not one that I was agonizing over, I actually came on for someone that PMed me) if it was personal  I would say I hate every part of this disease and I also hate the dark cloud that hangs over my head daily that reminds me of recurrence possibilities, it sucks and I deal with this every day of my life. However it does not change the fact that facts are facts. I am not going to take the time to pull up journal info for this thread, I don't have that kind of time, I have read them often and recently I attended a 4 Onc panel q and a from a very renown teaching university and they discussed one such study in detail.  Next time I am at an Onc appt. I will ask for a copy and try and post here. If you really want those studies they are easily googled. My concern is this is a forum for stage 1 and 2 to come and share their fears and I had a PM (from a new stage 2 gal in that is dealing with much anxiety) at the beginning of this thread asking if it was true that there is always always a stray cell that gets out, like one of the earlier posts stated and \"does that mean that we will all succumb to mets at some point\" the answer is No, I think we can all agree on that point and so in essence in the very simplest of terms some are cured. So I ask again why are you so intent on proving other wise this is not a personal question it is statement of fact. I hope we  are not dealing with pure semantics on this point because that is a simple solution. I really have never gotten upset on these threads as I try to be very respectful to where all are on their journey and I would never go on stage iv thread and try to prove that many are cured, I certainly have respect for that space. I ask that you give the same respect to stage 1 and 2 forum here by allowing them to feel some comfort that in \"some\" cases BC will not return for them and that in itself means they were cured or if semantics are a problem for you then \"it just didn't come back\". (is it really important to prove otherwise and if so why?) As I mentioned previously of course all of this upsets me and I have lost 2 dear friends and my aunt as well to BC, no one here has ever disagreed that many will not succumb to this disease we have only stated our opinion that some will not. I ask again why you want to argue this point and why that upsets you so much? Again Lowrider no one is disagreeing with you at all, we just also have a right to state our opinion on the outcome of this disease. Don't misinterpret my intentions anymore, as  you can't possibly know how I personally feel about this disease, obviously if I thought is was all happy cures all the way around I would not  be here posting as often as I do and discussing my fears with others.  That is all I am going to say on this, because my intention is not to change any ones mind here just to support other gals in their hope that these fears are normal and there is hope whether it be small, medium or large (that is subjective) that they may be one of those where they will not have their breast cancer return.  **Bonnie of course I know there is no stage V it was just a typo. Sorry! As I reread my post I again am flabbergasted that this is an argument, I have never argued on these threads ever..it seems ridiculous, as we are all here because we have some need to be fulfilled which is support, compassion or just education. I am not here to prove anyone wrong much of life is perception anyway so if I have offended any here I surely apologize I don't think any of us need that in addition to all else that we face.",

She is celebrating her 25th cancer free year party this Saturday. Here is her story... Sherry was dxed when she was 40 with Stage 3 BC, 7 out of 12 nodes positive, large tumor. She was ER positive but tamoxifen was not in the picture yet so she had a mastectomy (one side) and 6 months of chemo and thats it. Back in the day the Docs gave her less than a 50 percent survival. She just turned 65 had 4 grandkids and is retiring. Invited to her party is my Stepmom (15 year survior of stage 2b 3 nodes) and their close friend 16 nodes 11 year survivor. They both state they only know one person personally that has died and that was my paternal aunt who had huge tumor 6 nodes and did not do chemo it was back in the day when they only believed in Tamox  for er positive cancer, this was a weird 6 month period 15 years ago. Anyway they have seen a lot and say that many  do well. We don't hear it because they are not online. None of these 3 women even know about BC.ORG. BE WELL!!

There are \"journal papers\" and much research illustrating that 60-70 percent are cured with surgery. Yes CURED! It has not traveled outside the area. This is not just stage 1, I asked a panel of Oncs this very question and they state that yes stage 3 can be \"cured\" with surgery as well. The other 30-40 percent may have had cells travel out of the area and chemo may help or may not, there are new chemos, molecular chemos like Herceptin that are \"thought\" to be able to cure or create death pathways or as Lowrider states turn off the receptors. (this has yet to be proved as it is too new) It is wrong to believe some are not cured and I think the statement that everyone has stray cells is incorrect.  I know many with BC or have had BC, of the 10 that I know best \"in person\" 2 sadly passed (one stage 1). But the other 8 make up over 90 years of survival between them, one (26 years,one 23 years, one 18 years, and 16 years.  Yes it is true that it can come back after this time but all 4 of these women's Oncs state that their chances now are the same as the general public. (and 2 of these women were stage 3) Just in the way that it is incorrect for any of us to come on here and state that BC is curable in most cases it is incorrect for anyone to come on here and say there are No cures for any types of BC and I think that really dashes some of the hopes of those on this thread. I know it would have for me 1 year ago. This is a horrible disease ... and I know by reading the boards how many are suffering physically and mentally, it depresses  me consistently...that being said I hope all will know that much like many things there are good and bad outcomes here but lets not discount the good as well.",

My friends and family have been worried about me because this is just not me. Anyway finally I relented and went on a half dose of Lexapro and I have to say I started feeling better. The way they finally got me to GET IT, was explain it as we are young and we have instant menopause, and can't take hormones. As I spoke to many people around me that had been through natural menopause I found like (my family and MIL) had all taken biodenticals to get through it and here we are suffereing BC and instant menopause. Anyway they say that the hormones help brain function and the antidepresant is actually replacing that function that no hormones has taken away. I won't stay on it too long as it has its own SE's but for now it is what I needed. I think we had similar dx and time frame and I think it is pretty normal, most I have spoken took something and then got off it down the road.",

If you use a nose spray like nasonex you will find immediate relief but should use for a week or so to get rid of congestion. Every time I take a big whiff of nose spray it immediately pops and unclogs ears. ",

I also have a Dr. Hottie, he is my Plastic Surgeon, I adore him and he is as good on the inside as outside. The only problem is after all the treatment we found out he belongs to our golf club so I run into him all the time and I hate that he has seen me at my worst LOL",

Its like theay all expect me to croak any day. The other thing I hate is someone always telling me about their friend that just died of BC, this is so stupid, and it happened the other day and my friends shhhusshed her and I was the ONE that was being shushed about, do you know what I mean? Like I was too fragile to hear this and they were giving her sideways glances and shushing her so as not to upset me, I hate being treated like a victim.  I just want to be the old strong me that was comforting people not the victim of the pity party. I hate that i am \"that\" person.",

I am curious is all the running helping you get the weight. Off? I was a pre chemo runer and have not felt good enough (joints) to start yet but can't get the weight off with other exercise. 1 hour walk every day and 3x per week 2 hours tennis. I was previously lean and fit now I have gained 10 lbs. Also thanks so much for sharing your fears, I hate TM's just hate them. I work for the lab and can look them up anytime and I just torture myself.",
