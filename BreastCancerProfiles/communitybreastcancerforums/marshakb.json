Nash, I have already been changed from Tamox to Femara about 3 weeks ago.  I really questioned why I was still on Tamox as I hadn't had a period since starting chemo in Feb 07.  As a fellow PILC gal what are your thoughts on chemo being affective on mets for us?? Lv2travel, my recent tumor markers, liver profile etc was all normal!  Only thing out of range was elevated white cell I'm also disapointed that no one mentioned Zometa for prevention or even one of those weekly pills for bone health.  I sound like I am second guessing.  I think I am just pissed off.  LOL  Maybe because the Zometa is $5000 a pop and I am uninsured?  I've already started the SSDI process and have had the Medicaid interview.  I worry about that $350 monthly Femara prescription. I did discuss the ablation with the rad doc.  He wants to wait and see what kind of recommendation my med onc makes.  I see him Monday. NO SYMPTONS girls except for what felt like your garden variety pinched sciatic nerve.  Of course, now that I know, I hurt in all places he pointed out.  I'm trying to think positively.  I had myself built up to get news of \"It's everwhere\" but at least there was not a node involvement to be found anywhere. Melanie, I love you honey.  When you fly out can I expect the Royal Treatment you are so known for??  LOL  Love to all....... Marsha",

I love that for you.  Big ole hug for you girl!  Marsha PS When are YOU gonna jump back on that stage??  It was great that Leah, Twink and Melanie could make their Florida trip so they could see \"Patsy\"  After all we had been thru, to share \"life goes on\" with them was beyond words.  BTW, Leah is NED too, no treatments, just scanned regularly and she is doing awesome.",

It is a huge tax right off for them. They can \"bill\" at full price and write it off on their taxes so alot of them do this instead of pro bono work as long as it goes thru a charity organization.

I was taken off Femara and moved to chemo based on progression. I still have AI's I haven't tried yet but he didn't want to take a chance of more growth in the 3 months it would take to know if it is working. Are tumor markers a good indicator for you?? Yeah, I would never be on this stage iv forum if \"positive thinking\" had anything to do with cancer. After I thru the kitchen sink at my original dx, I was SURE I was done with the BC world!

What alot of people don't understand is you can have NO pain from the actual tumor but it makes that bone weak and you get related pain, like my sciatic or over use of a muscle/tendon pain. It WAS the sciatic nerve that caused the pain because it was exposed and rubbing against the crumpling bone. I'm not trying to scare you but pain lasting that long needs to be checked out with a PET/CT scan. Praying it is nothing!",

So until the patholody results come back you have no idea of staging at all. Mine was 5 cm and I most certainly am not stage 4. That is about aggression and the biopsy doen't show that until the path results are back. So you will know that tommorow. Stage 4 also means it has spread to other areas of the body and they would need PET/CT scans, MRI, bone scan etc. I think you misunderstood something. To be stage 4 the nodes would most likely be involved. Let us know what you find out from the pathology and maybe we can help you figure it out. You're a good friend! Marsha",

The a week later started rads so yes doing rads/tamox at same time. HOWEVER i found (thru google) that the SSRI my pcp had me on interferes with tamoxifen, prevents it from breaking down into whatever makes it anti-estrogen in nature. Did any of my docs seem to know that? Geez............ Saw the pcp, ask him about it, he leaves the room, comes back and says yeah we need to ween you off. Well haha I had already started that process. Didn't think I need an anti depressent anyway I about the least depressed person I know so am off of that completely now. Feel 100% more like my old self. I'm sitting here shaking my head. Marsha",

Being knowledgable about BC and signs and symptoms usually will make your docs respond to you better and at least do follow up to relieve the anxiety of not knowing. Yes, maybe she needs a new doc, but the analogy you used that questioning a doctors opinion is like picking up a knife and doing your own surgery is extreme.

Closest airport is Orlando.  I drive a PT Cruiser Convertible and would be able to pick up someone at the airport on the way.  It seats 4 but my trunk is small.  I think Orlando Airport has shuttles to Port Canaveral. LuAnn, I'm leaving for the weekend so don't get worried when I don't post!!  LOL",
