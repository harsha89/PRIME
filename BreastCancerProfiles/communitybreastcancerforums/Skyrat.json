Right now, you have a lot to take in.  A lot of anxiety as well.  But it does pass.  The oncologists are really good at making sure you have the medications to help you deal with anxiety, nausea, sleeping issues, depression, etc.  Stay on top of things during your treatment. I take it that your doctor has biopsied the lump?  My experience was that nobody could say for sure that I had cancer without the biopsy - they could just tell me that it didn't feel good or look good.  With the biopsy came the staging. One thing that I found through all this, is that the cancer becomes secondary as you deal with the treatment.  Do keep us informed.  So sorry you had to join us!",

They were compassionate and quick.  They did request my medical records, but told me it was not up to the doctor but their panel as to whether I was disabled or not - and what I put in the app would have more weight than a note from the doc.  Fortunately, I'd had my onc fill out the FMLA form stating that I was not able to work at that time.  That has not been rescinded and will not be. Apparently the medical personnel were quick to respond to the request for records, and it all went quite smoothly and quickly.",

What is 'THIS'?  Doctor visits.  Chemo.  Remission.  Doctor visits.  Chemo.  Remission.  For how long?  How long do I want to keep treatments going?  Every time the mets pop up again?  Actually, right now, I do have an answer to that question - for as long as I don't have the pain!  And if chemo with mets stops the pain, I suppose that it will be the cycle til it just don't work anymore or I am cured.  LOL Anyway - I do have a door open if I feel the need to talk to a counselor.  But, it is going to be interesting to see - if this is a side effect of the chemo, along about next Monday I will be on the phone to the oncology clinic giving them the symptoms I am feeling.  If it's not the chemo, then we will work from there - maybe up my antidepressant or antianxiety. Why am I writing such a lengthy book on a site where so many people are too busy to really want to be bothered reading - well, I am wondering if anyone else on CMF has had these feelings.  I'm not talking about the feelings of 'wanting' to do something violent - I'm talking about the feeling where the things you love, you pets, family, become the object of your rage and there is a very REAL probability of hurt being put on them.  I am hoping like he** I am not the only one! 5-1-08, Stage IV mets to the spine, 19/21 nodes metastatic adenode carcinoma, abundant vascular involvement; skyratgina.vox.com/ Dx 4/12/2007, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 19/21 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
