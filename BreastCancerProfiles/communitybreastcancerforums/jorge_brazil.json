At early january, my wife found a lump on her breast and two weeks ago we got the positive result for breast cancer. She went throught many tests, her mastectomy will probably be conducted at early march followed by chemo. We will be certain of these things next week, when all the test results will be ready. But some of them just started arriving at her email and the ki-67 level made me very scared. At 60/70%, I know it is considered very high, since anything above 20% is high. We also got ER positive and HER2 negative, which seems to be good news, according to what I googled. But searching about high ki-67, all I found are unfavorable prognostic factors and shorter surival rate. I know I shouldn't be looking for those things online before talking to a doctor and getting a more accurate report, but I'm terrified by the prospect of losing her. We met in high school and started dating while we were in college and have been together ever since. Our marriage is very good and things were fantastic so far, we were planning to have kids in late 2018 but now we have no idea about our future. It has been hard to stop thinking about this and I'm just crying and feeling breathless. I run every day and usually running my daily 6k calms me a lot, but I just couldn't do it. As soon as I started running, my thoughts went back to it and my heart rate and breathing got all screwed. I don't know what to do. Sorry for the long post, but what are your experiences with high ki-67 breast cancer? What should I expect? Log in to post a reply",
