I am relieved to hear that since it has been a month and it hasn't gotten any worse that it is unlikely ibc. I think my biggest concern were my swollen lymph nodes but they are not hard and are movable which is a good sign that it is not cancer and is most likely an infection. I will be getting a breast MRI this Tuesday and hopefully ibc will be ruled out. Thanks again for your help I truly appreciate it!",

Just a couple of weeks ago my lymph nodes under my arms have become swollen. I have heard that skin punch biopsies can have false negatives. Is requesting a breast MRI the best way to determine if someone has ibc? Do MRI's also have false negatives? If you do receive a punch biopsies is it safe to biopsy the lymph node under the arm without damaging the lymph node? Truly appreciate all advice that can be given! Log in to post a reply",

The skin on breast has not thickened or hardened. The skin on my nipple does look thicker though. The breast has not contracted or became less movable. It has been a month. Was wondering how long it would take for these symptoms to happen if it was ibc? I was denied a biopsy so requested a MRI which was approved. Does ibc look the same as other cancers on a MRI? If not how does ibc appear on a MRI? Can a radiologist that is unfamiliar with ibc be able to identify the cancer if is ibc? Greatly appreciate your advice!",
