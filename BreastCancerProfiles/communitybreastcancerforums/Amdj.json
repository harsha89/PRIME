She notice the top quadrant of my right breast is definitely more dense and fibrous than the left. I went for a mammogram and U/S. the results came back normal ; however the receptionist at the DR office said the US noticed several lymph nodes and numerous clusters of cystswithin the right breast but it's healthy and I need to go back in 6 mths for a follow up US. What does this mean? Why would this happen to only one breast? HOw can you tell that it's healthy without a biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
