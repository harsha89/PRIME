I just finished 33 rads on Friday after mx last September, no break but should have a few weeks ago. My doctor warned me, I just was not in a situation I couldn't get done by Friday at the latest. I hurt, burns, sore is oozing...its gross. I feel like crap!! So tired, but not like take a nap tired. My mussels hurt so bad. I managed to walk at least a mile a day from day one, still just feeling super exhausted. Stairs are the worse. The last few days I have noticed my joints are super painful. Elbows, knees, back, everything. My chest feels tight, maybe just out of shape? Can't cough deep, it hurts. This has been going on since I had 4 surgeries from September to December last year, sucked it up to the anesthesia. It seems worse the last few weeks now. I just want to do what ever I can to be healthy and strong as quick as possible. I was thinking about some vitamins or herbal stuff for the joint point, just not sure what.

I went in for pain in one side, got a full 3d mammo followed by a ultrasound that was supposed to be one sided. After the mammo they called and got permission to do both sides. My cancer was in the oppisate side and ONLY found because I did a 3d. I don't want to scare you, I just feel if you are in there for one thing they should be doing a throu job. If there is anything concerning, I would recommend an MRI as well. I am 36 too, we have dense breasts! lol My MRI found stuff that was missed in my mammo as well.

Depending on your age, that can be your hardest hurdle. If you are young, some doctors can push you \"off\" as being too young for breast cancer. Don't anyone tell you, \"chances of it being cancer is so \"small\" don't worry about it\". Cancer dosn't care about statistics...I have the \"cancer you want\" and yet I have continued to prove the statistics wrong. I am not trying to scare you, just EMPOWER you. You have a right to have solid answers, not \"probebly xyz\". If your NP blows you off, call another doctor like Bella mentioned a cancer center/obgyn.

It's one thing to prepare a patient for dx (imo they shouldn't even do that...but another story) it is a whole nother to be telling you what surgery to expect, treatment ect. He KNOWS CRAP, regardless of his expirence. All they did is find one lump...another is found that all changes. I had biopsies on 3 of 4 lumps found, 1 was IDC. A week or so later I had an MRI....it found 2 more lumps that were later confirmed more IDC. Lumpectomy went out the window after the MRI. I just really really caution you holding his advise as solid. Recommend getting an MRI before any desision is made, and maybe a 2nd opionon. It is really easy to \"trust\" your doctor so you don't have to deal with the stress of a 2nd opionion. It is HARD! I am happy with my surgeon, but honestly looking back I wish I had gotten a 2nd opionion. I just got a 2nd opionon for reconstruction, I am so very thankful I did! There is still a chance he is flat our wrong as well and it is b9. :) Feel fee to PM if you would like to chat.",

Nothing has helped and they are getting worse. Is it possible the CT missed something or it was too small and something would show up at this point? I discussed this with my MO yesterday....he basically didn't care once I said the CT was clear. I have an appointment with my general doc Monday, #1 on my list to discuss. Any suggestions? Push for another CT? Are these symtoms related to brain mets? I do not have numbness/tingling/loss of use stuff. I do have dizzy/light headed spells when they are the worse. No chemo, no tamoxifen, no cancer related treatment that would cause headaches. I'm at a loss....",

A few things you ladies mentioned...I am not DCIS only. :) IDC mixed with DCIS both times. I was dx with mulifocal last July-3 tumors. Onco came back as 15. I had surgery and was advised to take Tamoxifen. Due to several other surgeries and just scared of the stuff...I didn't consider starting it until January. Before I could, I had a new tumor. January I had my 6 month check up--all was good. Febuary I felt the new lump---no one knows if it was \"missed cells\" or if it is a new tumor all together. I am split betwen doctors in Idaho and Montana. The first time everything was done in Idaho (where I am from). Now...I did surgery in Idaho (no breast only surgen in Montana) and was looking at chemo/rads in Montana. Idaho doctors say no chemo--rads only. Becasuse I didn't take tamoxifen and because the onco dx the first time was 15. They did not want to do another onco at all---I pushed for it and it was declined by insurance because they submited it as a \"local recurrance\". Montana doctors- resubmiting onco dx as a new tumor--currently waiting for result. This 2nd time, my progeston is lower (though still positive), the tumor was NOT in the scar, Ki67 is much higher, it came back in 6 months--sooner than normal for a recurance, I am young, STRONG family history of bc-though negitive for genetic testing, and the belief that my \"low 15\" will no longer be low when the TALORx results come out---they recomend chemo. TC 4 times. My MO is also in touch/knows an MO that is working directly on the TALORx trials and got feedback from her- she strongly recommended chemo and NOT Tomxifan but a combination of lupron and letrazol---I don't much about those yet. As for rads now....we are trying to close on a house and move back to Idaho mid July. I need to be closer to family and help as my husband is gone for work a lot- 2 weeks gone/then 2 weeks home. If I do rads in Idaho--I am 3 hours away from the closest facility however, I can do chemo 20 min from the house we are buying. My Idaho doctor said if the onco dx came back high he would give me chemo after rads, but recommended I start rads asap and not wait for the TALORx/onco dx results. I was comfortable with that plan and start Wednesday. I feel like I am in this weird gray area. I can't find studies on treating multifocal, only how high the recurrance rate is which is out the window. I don't understand why someone with one tumor is treated the same as someone with 3. Also, my husband is 100% agaist chemo....to the point I'm not sure what it would do to our marrage. I know he loves me, he just feels it is barbaric, will kill me and I should eat \"dandelion roots\"....little sarcastic but he did send me a artical on how it will heal cancer in 3 days. I feel like I should do chemo, hoping maybe as time passes he will come around. He didn't \"research\" the first time....he did the 2nd time....so he is a bit behind on the processing. I had all the full body scans and was beyond EXCITED when they were clear...he didn't understand why my family/I was so excited. He had NO IDEA they were looking for mets or what it meant. Quality of life is more important than quantity.....but I feel like now is the time to fight...not when they tell you you have 6 months to live. Thats the time to consider quality over quantity....at least at the moment that is what I am thinking. Thanks for hearing me out...this is soooo long. lol",

It was just to be sure everyone was on the same page. I had a navigator that help cordinate most appointments. My breast surgens office scheduled the MO and RO appointments though. You do not need to really worry about anything before starting rads. That will be first from the sounds of it. When you meet with the MO, ask if the oncotype test is a good fit for you. If it is, it will then be ordered. It can take 2-3 weeks to get those results. That will only give you info on if chemo is needed. If you are not early stage cancer (and a few other requirements) you will not get the oncotype test. Its not beneficial for certain types and stages. Right now, focus on preparing for rads. There are some great threads on here with tips and tricks to make it a smoother process. As you gain more info, you can add it to the bottom of your posts and it will help us follow along. Hugs!

I will say, a random shooting, weird pain is what I first felt in my NON CANCER breast. Turned out to be a fibroadenoma that is just putting pressure on some nerve endings and not a big deal at all. Good luck!",

My mom has medical issues that gives her a mental balance if a 12 year old. She worries about everyone, gets things mixed up and then some.

Then follow with recon in March when both sides are \"level\" playing fields. I will add, the plastic surgen I met with also highly discouraged me to have any type of immediate recon. He gentaly showed pictures of complications and how difficult it is to have symmetry. For me, I would rather wait and have a better chance of being \"equal\" on both sides. lol There are a lot of horror storries of plastic surgery, I have to wonder if some is due to eagerness of patience and doctors. If I could do anything differently, I would have slowed down and had both sides done at teh same time. But, somethings have happened since and I can see it is working out as I need it to for insurance purposes. Are you sceduled for surgry yet?",

The only thing that may not be back on your pathology reports is your Hers...it will be positive or negitive. Mine came in a week or two later....something they have to do takes longer in the lab. I had a 3d that found 2 lumps, 1 turned out to be IDC. I am 36 and read up that I needed an MRI. Found a sergyn that had no issues and got it done. The MRI found 2 more spots that turned out to be IDC as well. NOW, get this....the largest of my tumors was found on the MRI...not the 3d. lol Go figure. That 1 spot turning into 3 made me go from lumpectomy as a possiblity to not. :( I also have had several doctors tell me that none of it would have been found had a chose a 2d. I tell you this for 2 reasons....I am not a huge advocate of 3d as well! Saved my life. And 2nd---I strongly recommend getting an MRI before any surgery. Also...as for reconstruction. Do some research!! And then do some more....I have met with my plastic surgen. I am a uni at the moment and planing to have the 2nd removed in January. They allowed me to make my own desision...but strongly recommended and showed me pictures of the high chance of complications that come with immediate reconstruction. My sergen also refused to allow it....he said his job was to save my life and I could worry about my breasts later. I am so glad he did! Also, if you end up with radiation it will most likly cause issues with expanders which you will have for some time before you are done with recon. Good luck with breast cancer 101~ :) felt like I was taking a collage course. :/",

They just do not know what gene mutation caused it. I would just really recommend looking at the whole picture, not just the genetic testing. Genetics is a very new science they are learning from everyday. I did not end up having chemo, my oncodx was 15. No radiation because I choose a mastectomy as well. Depending on the size of your tumor, they may still recommend radiation since you are able to do a lumpectomy. Most likely, chemo will really come down too if they don't find anything bigger and if your lymph nodes are clear. Good luck!",

I started spotting (VERY minor) about 9-12 months ago. But it wasn't a big deal so never went to the doctor. One of my apointments this week is to discuss this with my OBGYN. This is what I am confused about, and I am sure she will answre a lot of my questions, I just would like to go in prepared as well. I am ER/PR+....one was 100% and the other 95%. To my understanding when they remove your overy's, you are in immediate menopause and they way they help with symtoms is provide hormonal pills. Wouldn't that \"feed\" my cancer? So maybe I should avoid anything \"down there\"? lol With the spotting....not sure if the ablasion is wearing off or something else going on. Along with breast cancer, I also have ovarian cancer in the family history. :/ Just to clarify, when I orginally said \"nothing more\" I was referencing chemo and radiation. I'm fully expecting the hormon treatment which I beleive is the \"pill\" for 5 years. What is \"AI\"? Is Tamoxifen an AI? Trying to find more info on this, if anyone has a link that would be great.",
