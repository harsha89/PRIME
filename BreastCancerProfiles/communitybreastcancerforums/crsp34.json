It contained videos of precious events, videos of her giving advice, her favorite music, books, etc. that she wanted to pass on. While not everyone can afford to pop in an iPod, I like the idea of making a book of advice and your lists of favorites, or attaching little notes w/ memories to the baby blanket, etc. :)",
