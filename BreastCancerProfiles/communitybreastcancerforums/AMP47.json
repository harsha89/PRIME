There are many studies discussing the efficacy of this test.  Go to the Oncotype dx website there is alot of information available about the test My oncologist said this is only the beginning of the new wave in breast cancer treatment: personalised treatment for each patient.  By studying the biology of the tumour, doctors can make more effective treatment plans for their patients.  Traditional methods throw all of us over 1 cm into a chemo pool: a pool that over treated many women who did not benefit from chemo and suffered the long lasting effects of chemo when they did not have to.   ",

Unless you have another set of criteria that determines whether a person is responsible.  Doesn't sound like you do, though.   You discuss your daughter purchasing a private policy as responsible behavior.  So, I am assuming, that since this man has benefits that include health coverage, which includes his wife, he is considered to be responsible?  Both are responsible adults.   Can't have it both ways you are either pregnant or your not.   Second, his wife gets to stay home and not work if she desires-we live in America and we get to make that choice for our family. The last time I checked being a responsible person also is associated with being a responsible partner in sharing the duties of an economic partnership-marriage. He works she stays home.  Sounds OK to me.   Third, non profit companies that organize to help people such as this man and his wife, spend their money on staff, benefits and other items instead of helping the people they organized to help.  Now that is being a irresponsible: organization staffed with allot of adults along for the ride. Taxes paid by all of us responsible adults ultimately flow through the grant process  to these organizations.   Ummmm we pay taxes, the organization get  funds through grant application and distribution from either the feds or their state government who collects taxes;  the organization makes a promise, in their mission statement, to take care of people who need help if the government gives them money;  their staffs are taken care enjoy great health benefits, salaries and many perks;  but somehow the organization get out of helping the group they organized to help-now that sounds a little irresponsible to me.  What do you think?    Fourth, I am sure this man has p aid his fair share of taxes over the years that support the systems that support illegal aliens.  As citizen, don't you think the people paying the taxes should be entitled to the same benefits that illigal aliens are provided?  As a tax payer and small business owner-I DO.   Sure, you preface your argument to be politically correct that illegal aliens should not be given benefit, where have you been living in a cave?   NEWSFLASH-they get many services that we citizens can not obtain and this man is a \"case in point\". Oh, and those organizations that forgot what they organized for, to help American citizens, well, they extend help to this disparaged part of our population by helping them.  Why because it is politically correct and great publicity to help organizations secure future funding from the govenment.  Why on earth would they help the very person who works to pay tax that funds their organization????  Don't you think that is a little on the irresponsible on a very large scale?  Finally, I notice that you have invited all of us to, as you say, \"Flame Away\" laced in an undertone of cruel, unsympathetic lack of concern for your fellow human being.  Are you looking to do battle over the life of a sister on this web site?  This site is a support site dealing with life and death issues not a site for people who want to spin the facts of the matter and then invite debate.  Go to another site and debate away.  Or maybe you are looking to form your own \"death panel\" by making decision on who and who can not get medical help from the very organizations that he supports through his tax bill every year.   One last point, you obviously do not understand why the cost of insurance is beyond most peoples reach the insurance companies have very strong representation in congress to keep things the way they are.  This health bill just paved their way to financial heaven.  Not only are the doctors  going be receiving less money, 21% to exact,  private health insurance premiums are going up not down.   How do I know this-my private health insurance just took a steep increase.  Why, because of the new health bill provisions.  Gee, I wonder how many people who were employed for years, now unemployed, will be able to continue to pay the new premiums.  Darn those irresponsible people who can not afford being raped by the insurance company any more.  Shame on them   The insurance companies will add that to their bottom line the reduction in payment to physicians and the higher cost of customers premiums.  Not only do our doctors get screwed we are going to get screwed in the process.  Now that everyone will be fined for not having insurance more profits for the insurance company.  Eventually, your daughter will not be able to afford insurance, due to the rise in cost especially on a income of meger resource.  Will you then  label her irresponsible?  Or will you step down from your perch and take a hard look at the system that allow the insurance companies to manipulate  the health care system?  Maybe you should advocate for the insurance companies  and support their criteria which is screw the doctors and screw the patient and support the people who can continue to pay high premiums that feed the bottom line of the insurance company-sounds like legal thievery to me rooted in elitism.      Are you mean spirited sure sounds like it.   Would it do any good to tell you that probably not.  But, your statement is so egregious that comment is necessary.  ",

For two years I have read many articles, university studies, papers about the concordance between Ki67 and grade.  Also, I have accessed several doctors and \"popped\" the question to them.  Since the Ki67 was not part of my pathology report, I began to worry when reading alot of the post on this site with Ki67 information pathology report.  I have yet to read an article that does not discuss the concordance with ki67 and grade being: low Ki67 = low tumour grade.  The reason my report does not include Ki67 is because of newer techniques for determining proliferation rate is now being used.   My oncologist said the mitotic rate is the most important number for me which was 1.  Also, they do not use Ki67 as a measure of survival anymore, or a prognostic factor for overall survival, at least in my area. The Internet is full of medical journals, articles and studies dealing with the question.  Hope this helps.  Good luck in your research.   ",
