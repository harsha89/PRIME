If I had to commute the way I did when I lived in Californi, I do not think I could have done it every single day. I was fine the first few weeks, then it can start to exhaust you. About when they were done I was beyond exhausted, and am just starting (I think it has been 4-6 weeks since I finished) to feel some energy returning. We are all different with so many other factors to account for - commute, children, etc. Good luck with your decision! (one thing I may hve done different would be to schedule them for the end of the day - I didn't do that because in my job it is near impossible to actully leave on time for n appt (partly my fault cause I can't say no when someone has something they say is important to get done) but at least then I could have gone right home after.

I hope they order one for you, better to see what the heck is going on now! And your appt will be here before you know it, luckily it is not months out as so many other women here have posted they have to wait.  agh - i have chemo brain - reason i was posting was to say how we women always let ourselves be psyched into thinking \"it is in our heads.\" It really makes me mad. BC can hurt, and so can benign tumors/cysts. I had pain in the breast area and shooting pain from the lump site to my underarm (where more cancer was found.) This DOES NOT mean yours is cancer, it is just to dispel the myth that cancerous tumors \"do not hurt\"  - bull! They do. AGAIN, so do non-cancerous, but my chemo-brain point was that the pain is not imaginary, and i am tired of people's sexist attitude that it is \"all in our heads.\" Take care, try and \"chill\" until your appointment!!!",

I am 3 weeks post chemo (started in August) and I feel the same way - leg aches, walking up the stairs out of breath, and my collar bone really hurts. Since my BMX is scheduled for a week from Monday, I am trying to get a lot of things done (cleaning, painting the kitchen, making sure I have everything) and am starting to freak out at how will get it all done. I started a zillion projects I want to finish as I am so afraid of possible limited use of arms after surgery! I think I am doing it to keep my mind off of the upcoming surgery and I have another PET scan tomorrow. The BMX recovery completely freaks me out. (Not so much the thought that I am losing my breasts, which is a bummer, but how am I going to heal, do things etc. My daughter will only be here for 4 days then it is just me!) Anhow, sorry to go on about myself, I am just getting so nervous. I just wanted to let you know physically I am not as strong as I thought I would be after last chemo. God Bless! Oh yeah - what caught my eye too was you live in Winfield! I used to, and my children were born there! Great town!!",

I did 6 rounds TCH, finished 29 rads/5 boosts today (yippee!) and am exhausted, but okay! 1 yr of herceptin still to go. In retrospect, there are things I should have been told between surg and rads re physical therapy, and you should try and get that info now so you can start slowly to get your arms ready for radiation. I think you'll do great, and as with chemo, rads will seem like they will never be over - then poof - done!!!",

I have dense breasts and was NEVER EVER told that certain BC's (of course the bad ones) are NOT detected on mammo's in dense breasts. Had i been armed with this knowledge, I would not have allowed them to zap me with mammos for the past 10 years. What a waste of resources! And i had the money to do ultrasounds if insurance would not have covered it - but i had no idea.   What area do you live in? I am sure if you post it (the general area) one of us on this wonderful site will know of resources in your area than can help you get a biopsy. Please, for your children's sake, keep pushing them to biopsy you!! In the interim, take it easy, show your children joy, etc. etc. ! The test may very well come back fine, but you need to know!",

First, please understand that chemo is usually not as horrible or terrifying as it sounds, and kind of like childbirth, even a few months after it is hard to remember how bad it was because it is totally worth it - the chance to beat this booger. I guess from all I researched, learned and experienced throughout this, I am shocked they are not considering chemo, and chemo NOW. There has to be some info missing or results that give it a lower stage or something. Please, please get a second opinion, if only so you do not have to question yourself later should (God forbid) things get worse, which is a valid concern you have mentioned.
