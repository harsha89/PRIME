My surgeon is recommending a sentinel node biopsy as part of the surgery - as a precaution - because an MRI sometimes misses things (it's not 100% the way the sentinel node biopsy is). I'm scared about two things: 1. the rest of lymphedema and 2. the idea of putting a radioactive injection into me when I don't have cancer (does my body need to process/metabolize that radiation). Does anyone have any insight? My surgeon said that 6% of women who do a PBM end of up having cancer and that if she were to find cancer in the breast tissue and not have done the biopsy, she'd have to go back in and that would put me more at risk for lymphedema. I'm wondering how many women opt to do this biopsy. Maybe it's because of my age/she's being overly cautious? Any advice is much appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
