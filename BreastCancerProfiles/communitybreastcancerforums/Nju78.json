    "Content": "Nju78 wrote: Hi everyone, A little over 2 weeks ago I found a small hard lump (no pain) in the area a few centimeters above my nipple. A week later I got an ultrasound and yesterday I received the results saying that there is a \"complicated\" cyst in my left breast and that I should get another ultrasound in 6 months. Today I made an appointment to see my doctor in a few days to discuss my ultrasound results because I believe there is now a 2nd lump and I want to get some clarifications on the results. I am really not sure if it was there before and I just missed it or it if a new lump did in fact grow within 2 weeks. It is also a small hard lump right underneath the first one. It would be strange that I would miss since i kept touching that area ever since i discovered it. So naturally I'm freaking out a bit. I am young with no previous family history of breast cancer, but this is still very concerning and messing with my mind. I'm sure those of you in the \"6 month wait club\" can attest to feeling a constant anxiety with this possibility looming over your head. I don't want to wait 6 months and I'm going to try and push for a biopsy depending on what my doctor tells me in our meeting. Do you guys have any insight into what a complicated cyst is? Is it possible that a new lump could grow in such a short amount of time? The anxiety is driving me nuts. Log in to post a reply",
