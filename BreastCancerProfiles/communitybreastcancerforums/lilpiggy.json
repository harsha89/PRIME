      "Content": "Oct 6, 2007 12:58AM - edited Oct 6, 2007 01:00AM by lilpiggy Thank you all so much for your comments and suggestions.  I about passed out when I seen a few of you went home after just 2 days, bless your hearts you are now my heros!  My surgeons say I will be in the hospital for at least 7 days but some of that could be related to my heart issues.  I will have the on-q soaker pumps also but kinda hope they will be in addition to oral meds and not a replacement.  I already have my old lady snap up gowns, tons of pillows, stool softners,  hooks for the shower to hang pumps on and live in housekeeper/nurse (my daughter) so I think I'm about as ready as I'm going to get for this surgery.  The closer it gets though the more nervous I become..  Thanks again to all that responded and would still appreciate any more suggestions anyone has.   ",
