I won't see my MO until April 1; my scores were reported over the phone.  I have a lot of questions about % chance of recurrence and luminal B.  It's definitely chemo for me, but I don't know what protocol or how many cycles. Thanks all for sharing your experience. I have been feeling quite alone with such a high score. ",

I will be in your pocket, as they say, with prayers and good thoughts.

Perhaps what they really mean is, \"I would never have cancer,\" as a way to put the fear at bay that this could ever happen to them.

I called it cotton head and could not sequence things correctly and kept starting things and walking away from them. Also, I couldn't stay on one subject when talking.

Cold, I love the pink! You rock. Timbuktu, yay, on a clear scan. Clarrn, yay, for finishing AC. I go for number 3 of 4 next Tuesday.  I can taste it just thinking about it, yuck. Mompv and Cammychris, I really feel for you. The decisions and waiting are so hard. I had high ki67 and high oncotype scores so chemo for me and lots of it, 6 months.  Although my MO disagreed, my BS called me from home just before the oncotype score came back to tell me that if it was his wife, he would want her to have chemo unless the score was very low.  The two opinions muddied the waters a bit, but my oncotype was so high it didn't matter in the end. So, my heels have been stinging and have been really, really itchy. I called my nurse and she said it was likely neuropathy cause by the cytoxin.  Has anyone else experienced neuropathy with cytoxin?  I knew taxol and taxotere had this side effect but not cytoxin.  :-(",

Lemonade, good luck with your infusion tomorrow.  I hope your SEs are minimal and that you stay out of the hospital this time. Brigadoon, Claratin is an allergy medicine.  It also helps to minimize bone pain after the nuelesta shot given in some chemo regimens to stimulate white blood cell production.  I don't think there is research on this, but my MO (medical oncologist) explained that the additional white blood cell production inside bones puts pressure on your bones and sometimes triggers a histamine response which causes the pain.  Claratin is designed to interrupt the histamine response for allergies and can work in this case too.  Also, I use Zyrtec for allergies and had no bone pain with nudists.",
