I KNOW this is just a blip in my history and that I will go on. I am very lucky to be a patient  of the Avon Breast Care Center of Boston. and that is why my cancer was caught so early. I will not have to do chemo, and I feel blessed for that. I am trying to use my weekends lazing around but its tough",

I am going away for 8 day with a couple of girl friends this month. My BF told my Dr I could go topless on the beach if I needed to \"radiate\" sooner!  Getting up and going to work is tough some days, I'm still having a problem with exhaustion  but I do get support from some of my customers who have been here.  When my mother was going though this she really suffered, but she believed in \"laugh or cry\"  so we did a lot of laughing. She was a very strong lady, I wish she was here for me.  Stillrunning, how are you doing with the tamoxifen?  I tried it 5 years ago but couldn't handle it. I'm relived that I am through menopause and will be trying Letrozole after radiation . Calling a counselor may be a good idea for me.",

I always  figured it would happen, but not till I was in my sixties. I had a lumpectomy and one lymph removed.  healing well, but the lymph is a nasty little bugger after a long day at work. I'm going to see about my radiation on Monday.   I'm really exhausted and hoping for a little input from any of you on how you deal with it.  Every one keeps telling me how strong I am.... Really some day I would rather  curl up and a corner and hope it all goes away,  But I can't do that.",

I don't know. has anyone else had this problem?",
