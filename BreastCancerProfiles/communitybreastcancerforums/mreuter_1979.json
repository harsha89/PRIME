It was found present in lesions they found on her Liver from on a biopsy. It was concluded that she had Stage 4 Breast Cancer based on Pathology Report. Today she had an MRI of here Breasts. No cancer was found by a radiologist! Just two small benign cysts! She is preparing for a Kidney biopsy to check 1 lesion on that organ next week but we are very confused by the news. We don't know whether to be happy or not since this is still confusing. Trying to finding reasons to be positive right now. Log in to post a reply",
