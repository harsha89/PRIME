I was hesitant to have him be the one to do it, but it was really my only option. The good news, I am completely closed up (hopefully, I will stay that way). I meet with my medical oncologist on Tuesday, and I guess she will give me the cut-off date for starting chemo. My fingers are crossed that she will extend the window a bit, so we can this done.",

Chemo will cause problems with healing, so most doctors opt to wait to avoid any further complications. My PS and MO had weekly phone calls about me and my healing status. My chemo start date was pushed so many times, I lost count! The 12 week window, is what the medical community considers the optimal time frame to start chemo. Studies have shown it mat be less effective after that point. To leave you with a little hope, I am due to finally start chemo next Monday, which will 12 weeks and 4 days for me.",

      "Content": "eschofi wrote: Just hoping I can find someone who has had a similar experience who can send some hope my way...I had a bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy on 4/13, on the advice of my Plastic Surgeon. I was not especially concerned with saving my nipples, but he encouraged it repeatedly saying I was a good candidate. My surgical pathology showed lymph node involvement and my Oncotype came back at Intermediate risk, so chemo was advised. Three weeks later, I went back in for revision surgery to remove the nipples which had become necrotic. After doing some research, I had a hard time believing he had ever recommended it as am overweight, had just quit smoking and had a small tumor close to my nipple. regardless, I had agreed to the procedure, so there isn't much to do about that. Since then, I have had a wound on either side, that was not healing. Finally, four weeks after the second surgery, I told him we needed to do something about it as the wounds were holding up me being able to start chemo. He debrided both wounds and gave me a cream to use and advised we would be able to start chemo in 3 weeks. On the advice of my breast surgeon, I went and saw a wound specialist. Within two minutes, he had discovered tunneling wounds that I can only assume the plastic surgeon knew nothing about. After a week of packing the wounds with silver, he is now advising the right tissue expander be removed as the top of the wound is exposing it. I don't feel super comfortable with my PS right now, so I am trying to see if my BS will remove it. I am now 10 weeks past my initial surgery, my oncologist says if we can't start chemo in the twelve week window, we will have to explore other options, and I am beyond frustrated. I have opted to be very aggressive throughout my treatment so I could have the best possible long term survival rate. I never thought this process would be so long or so difficult. I still can't pick up my 18 month old son, for fear of opening this wound any further. Does anyone have any experience with non-healing wounds, recovery time from removing tissue expander, or delayed start to chemo? I need some kind of hope right now.

I met with the plastic surgeon this morning and the tissue expander is coming out later this afternoon. He believes he will be able to close the wound and with a drain, thinks I will be able to start chemo in 2 weeks. I am crossing my fingers, but really appreciate you taking the time to share your story.",

I ended up with extensive necrosis, so PS did revision on 5/2. I had lymph node involvement and will need radiation. My oncotype came back at intermediate risk, so they are recommending a 12 week cycle of taxotare and cytoxan. I had a port placed on 5/16. Now for the frustrating part, PS keeps delaying start of chemo due to lack of healing from the second surgery. So far he's delayed twice. Right now, I am scheduled to start on Tuesday 6/4, but see the PS on Monday. I am so scared he will delay again as I still have pretty bad scabs on both sides. I feel like I've prepared myself for everything, and I just want to get started so I can get it over with. Anyone have a similar experience or any advice/words of wisdom?",

I am still waiting on a chemo start date, right now I am scheduled for 6/27, but am still having wound healing issues from my revision surgery. I saw a wound specialist yesterday, even though my PS said I didn't need to. He found a \"tunnel\" that I can only assume my PS didn't know about since he has done nothing to treat it. I am now packing the \"tunnel\" with Silver AG and bandages. He was not comfortable giving me a timeline for healing. I am worried as my MO had started mentioning the \"Optimal window\" for starting chemo and we are nearing the end of it. I am trying really hard to stay hopeful and positive that they will find a way to heal these wounds, but I just want to move forward, so I can put this all behind me. HapB, I too am still having a lot of discomfort with my port. They put it in almost a month ago, and there are times when I want to scream, and I'm not even using it yet! I hope yours starts to feel better soon.",
