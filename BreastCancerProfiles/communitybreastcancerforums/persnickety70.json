    "Content": "persnickety70 wrote: Hi everyone, First post here, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been through this specific situation, so hoping for a little perspective \"from the other side\" I am 47. Went in for routine mammogram in November, biopsy in December (after additional views). Initially told it was high grade DCIS, but someone didn't order hormone receptors. When they went back and recut the block, they found 2.1 mm of invasive CA. This came back ER+/PR+, Ki 21-30%, and HER2 indeterminate, but + by FISH. Next came an MRI, which showed a suspicious area 7 mm from the biopsy clip, they thought the clip had just moved. Had partial mastectomy and sentinel node, showed 6 mm invasive CA in background of atypical ductal hyperplasia, no remaining CA near clip, and this tumor is HER2 negative. 2 sentinel nodes were negative. They sent off for Oncotype, it came back at 25. Now my oncologist has sent off a Mammoprint, but had me go ahead and get a port as she said I would definitely need a year of Herceptin, with or without docetaxol. I will possibly get Perjeta and Carboplatin as well. Oncotype says my recurrence in 10 years is 17% without chemo. Looks like it is 7-10% with chemo, but the chemo used in these studies is not what they are now using, so it might be better. I am just afraid of not doing enough because I don't want the toxic chemo, vs overtreating something that is low risk to begin with.
