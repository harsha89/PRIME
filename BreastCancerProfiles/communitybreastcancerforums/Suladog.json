I sent my cold caps back. They worked really well for me and I did not lose any hair. However, I haven't had my hair colored since December as I didn't know when or if (docs were divided) I'd be starting chemo and the penguin guys said not to color your hair for a month before chemo. So that was the first week of December. Ok, so now I'm starting to look like Meryl Streep in Into the Woods. I am washing my hair as I always have done and started using my dryer with a diffuser ( I have curly hair now shoulder length) on low. No problems. No shedding, nothing. I really need to get my hair colored as we have a big event we're going to, also I can't stand looking at all the big grey streaks among the red. The penguin people say not to color your hair for 6 mos after chemo, but if I go that long I'm going to look like a yeti. Has anyone out there had any experience with this? I feel 6 mo is way too long to wait to look presentable. I know someone here mentioned they got their hair straightened just a few weeks after finishing chemo and everything was ok. So I'm wondering if the 6 mo thing is just an abundance of caution on Penguins part. My colorist is very good, and has found an ammonia free product, but it does have some peroxide. The only other thing she suggested is henna (no ammonia, no peroxide) which she's never worked with, which scares me.",

I was one of only two cappers at my local center, and the head oncology nurse is now recommending capping, before that she was a rather large pain in the butt about it and quite skeptical. here I am after finishing chemo.

I was very concerned about them too. 25 yrs ago I was in the hospital for a week after my mx, which was how they did stuff then.. The nurses took care of everything so I never had to deal with them. That's what I was obsessed with last time last year, I thought I'd never be able to deal with a drain myself. A nurse friend showed me what to do and my husband helped me take care of it and it wasn't bad at all. I!d worked myself into quite a state worrying about them. I only had 1 drain. Do you have someone who can help you with that when you go home from the hospital?",

I cold capped and so did not lose my hair. There are a lot of ladies on the boards who have done it. My doctors at UCSF suggested it and it worked great with that protocol. I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes, (easily disguised) all the hair \"down there\" the carpets didn't match the drapes, I had hardwood flooring (nobody's business buy the husband and me) and have not had to shave my legs yet. If they don't mention it, ask about penguin cold caps aka known here as PCC. There are a lot of ladies who can give lots of advice and recommends, depending on where you are. I can show you what my hair looked like post chemo if you'd like.",

I had breast cancer once before on the other side when I was in my 30's and that time I was triple negative. 25 years later I was diagnosed on the other side with Triple positive BC. I just completed Taxol/herceptin chemo 1 time a week for 12 weeks. It's the new recommended protocol for people with HER2+ tumors less than 1 cm and no nodes involved. If you're HER2+ you will be doing some form of chemo as it tends to be aggressive even if the size is small and no nodes are involved. The Taxol/herceptin is followed by Herceptin alone 1 time every 3 weeks for the rest of the year. Herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that goes right after the HER2, it's technically not a chemo so there are no or minimal side effects. Taxol is considered a \"gentler\" form of chemo, it still causes hair loss, but I cold capped at the suggestion of my doctors at UCSF and kept all my hair. Here I am just 2 months after chemo..uh, that's my spinach from my garden. If you're worried about keeping your hair during chemo I highly recommend cold capping, there are lots of forums about it here on the site. It's a pain in the ass as it takes time, BUT works exceptionally well with the taxol/herceptin combo..as you can see and also affords one the privacy of not having to explain hair stuff to everyone. If you didn't know I was having chemo, you would never notice anything, it worked that well. The 12 week deal means you are getting a much milder dose, one time a week for 3 months, rather than a larger dose every three weeks. It's more weeks which is no no picnic as far has having to go in every week, but my doctors said it's gentler on the system that way. I found it to be so, as the chemo I had 25 yrs ago was CMF every 3 weeks. Be careful with Lord Google as a lot of the data on HER2+ is very outdated, and as my oncologist who's the co head of the comprehensive Cancer Center at UCSF told me if you have to have a mutation..that's the one to have right now because they have something for it and ore in the pipeline. 10 or 15 years ago it was a different story. You will find a lot of great information here on this site, and plenty of people who are dealing with the same stuff. Don't be afraid to ask questions here, and of your doctors. You are your best advocate in this. Feel free to private message me if you need any other info. ",
