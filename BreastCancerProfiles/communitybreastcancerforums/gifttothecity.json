I went to a clinic immediately and they said that it was possibly an infection and I should wait a bit longer before stressing too much about it. I had a panic attack about it three days later so I went to emergency. They looked at it using an ultrasound. The doctor said it was likely a cyst or abscess, but he asked if I had a history of breast cancer or if I had any other symptoms in my breast. This terrified me. I didn't have anything else, so he told me to get it checked out by my family doctor within the month and just monitor it to see if it goes down. So that brings me to today: It has gone down significantly and there is no pain anymore. I can still see it at the surface of my skin if I lift my arm, but when I push on it or put it between my fingers, it feels really small. I went to my family doctor today and he said that since it was painful and has gone down, he believes it was a cyst with a bit of an infection. He seemed pleased that it was as small as it was. He didn't feel it was necessary to do an ultrasound at this point...Â  I'm still worried. Would you be at this point? Can breast cancer swell up and then go away? Log in to post a reply",
