I had a free tram reconstruction but can't imagine why I would find scar tissue at such a late date and why in such a specific spot and so far above the surgical scar.  Does breast tissue even go that far up on our chests?.  Can't even get in to see my surgeon until 7/10---another exercise in finding out how much tension I can take.  For a variety of reasons I don't want to tell anyone in my family yet so you guys will just have to put up with me!  Has anyone had an experience like this?    Live in the moment!
