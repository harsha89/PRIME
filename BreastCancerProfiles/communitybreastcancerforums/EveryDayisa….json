They visited and brought food, kept telling me I looked good (even if I didn't), helped me do dry hair washes (because my PS said no shower allowed until drains removed) and a nurse friend visited to help me with my drains, binder and dressing. I did not hire any outside help but it would be good to have the information in case you do want to consider it. There is a lot of good info on this site, wish I had known about this site prior to my surgery! You will need help reaching for things above your shoulders and driving. You should plan to take it easy and no lifting as you don't want to risk opening up your wounds and almost everyone I talked to was totally wiped out. I am about 3 months out and I am still not 100 percent but tons better than when I came home from the hospital. I agree with preplanning and getting as much info and questions answered ahead of time. Positive thoughts and hugs to you... ",
