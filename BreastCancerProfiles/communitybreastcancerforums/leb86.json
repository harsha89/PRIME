I felt like was going to get sick. Ran to the bathroom and laid on the floor. Sweating and nausas but never got sick. Still not feeling well I had to use the restroom. When I got up to flush i blacked out for a second. I have a call in to my nurse. Just wondering if this happened to anyone els Log in to post a reply",
