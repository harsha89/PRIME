I'm sure more ladies will be chiming in to help you but I think chewing on ice helps prevent the sores in the mouth. Some suggestions may be to eat things that are kind of bland.  You might want to try crackers and soup, broths, jello, applesauce, etc.  Things that you can tolerate.  I really didn't have too much of a problem with my appetite but those are some of the suggestions I've seen and read about.  I am sure someone else will chime with more help.  I hope you both feel better.

I really can't compare it to losing a limb, but it feels like it may be somewhere in that neighborhood given the trauma of the diagnosis and everything that goes along with having breast cancer.  I don't think your friend can relate to how you feel and I hope she never does but it's certainly not a vanity thing.",

I remember when the news broke someone else on this board was irritated with her but don't you think that just like a lot us she came to this site looking for answers, help and support?  Just because she's a celebrity does that mean she doesn't deserve it? We (sisters on the board) don't always agree with one another. We may watch an interview of CA for 5 minutes and get bent out of shape for a couple of comments we may not agree with and we ostracize her?",
