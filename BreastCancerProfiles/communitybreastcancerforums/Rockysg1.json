I am being transferred from the USVI (St. Croix) to DC (I'm in the military) for treatment. My thoughts and best wishes are with everyone scheduled for surgery this month.

I overheard the person analyzing the cells say they look like cancer and the radiologist told me that she will be surprised if it was anything other than cancer. I was prepared for that news but of course still have to wait for the actual results next Thursday but will hopefully hear yea or nay for sure on Monday.",

Overall I am still in good spirits no crying, but I think I just haven't wrapped my head around this yet as far as the serverity of the situation. I hope I can actually maintain this attitude...lol. Again guys thank you so much for your support, No sorries please it's no ones fault and I don't like sympathy just ears out there to listen so again thank you so much:) Carp: I won't be able to make it there on Wed but I have my appointment at 0800 with the \"team\" so if you have time or work close let me know, I'm sure I'll run into you sooner or later:)",
