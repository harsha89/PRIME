I have had my exchange with not ideal results so having it done over in Nov. I was told by my onc Dr. I would need rads all a long but when I went to Radiologist he said no. This was all before this new study. I had 26 nodes removed. I have to go with the mind set they got it all with chemo.I have 4 Grandchildren that I need to dance at there wedding some day.",
