Condolences for your loss.  My mother passed away in 2000 (of lung cancer) and I still miss her so much.   Best, Sharkey ",

Please, hang in there and know, you are not alone or crazy.  You can find a path through this.  And you will be amazed by the many people who show up to help you in big and little ways. Hugs, Sharkey ",
