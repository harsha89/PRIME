    "Content": "PeregrineEllie wrote: Hi, I'm Ellie :)  I'm 30 years old and have had 6 rounds of dose-dense chemo. The first four were AC, the last two were Taxol - the next two (this coming week and two weeks after) are Taxol as well. As soon as the last Taxol treatment is over, within 2 weeks, I'm having a bilateral mastectomy with sentinel lymph node removal. My doctor said I'll only be in the hospital one or two days?! Is this common? I expected a longer stay but I am fine with the 1-2 days! Because I am high-risk (BRCA 2 positive), I found out I could either have my ovaries removed or take (I think it's called) Herceptin for 5 years following the mastectomy surgery. I'd like to have immediate reconstruction but I have to wait until I talk to my surgeon again to find out more about this. And after all of that, I'll likely have a small amount of radiation to the chest wall as a prophylactic. My doctor cannot feel by hand any of the four large tumors that once were there, so I've had a great response to chemo (even if I haven't FELT so great LOL). I always wanted to have children. I'm not married, and have no children. Is this pretty much a \"no\" for having biological children? If it is, I will adopt someday :)  Has anyone been through a similar experience to mine?
