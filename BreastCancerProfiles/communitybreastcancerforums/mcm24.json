My GP felt my lymph nodes and did not notice any swelling. I was due for my yearly pap smear and mammo. My gyny couldn't feel a lump, but a mammo and ultrasound did. It turned out to be cancer. I think these twinges are what saved my life because even though I didn't want to run to the doctor with every little twinge, continued twinges meant something and finally got me to a doctor!Â  We women know our bodies better than our doctors and we need to be persistent if we feel that something just isn't right.",
