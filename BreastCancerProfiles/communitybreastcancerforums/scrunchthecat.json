That's right - I noticed swelling in my right arm before I had a biopsy or surgery or even chemotherapy. I just though it was \"weird\" and I never associated it with possible breast cancer. Once I was in the process of being diagnosed, none of my doctors had ever heard of anyone having lymphedema before treatment and had nothing to say. Fortunately I found a lymphedema-certified PT about three months in. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Did anyone else have lymphedema as a symptom of breast cancer??

      "Content": "scrunchthecat wrote: I have Stage IV HER2+ MBC. I have been looking for a vaccine clinical trial, but the ones I know about are either full, don't have enough money or are not appropriate for me. I read on these boards that there are vaccine therapies available in Germany. So I contacted one of the clinics that were discussed favorably - the Hallwang Clinic. I had a 30-minute conversation with one of the doctors, and I feel that it was very informative. I wanted to share with all of you what I learned, it is below. DISCLAIMER: I am not endorsing or advocating for the Hallwang Clinic, or any clinic. I have never had any communication with a clinic before. I wanted to share my experience with others who may be considering the same thing. So my case: I am HER2+++, ERnegative, PR < 5%. (They don't treat me for PR.) I was diagnosed in May 2015, underwent 6 rounds of THP, and am now on H&P indefinitely. My original PET-CT in May showed the breast tumor, lymph node involvement and a few, small, spots on my liver. My second PET-CT in October showed resolution of all the lymph nodes and the liver. It just showed what was described as \"residual\" disease in the breast, with max SUV of 3.3. First, the German doctor told me this: If my \"residual\" breast activity is NOT resolved by my next PET-CT, it is possible that the tumor is growing resistant to the anti-HER2 therapies, possibly turning HER-2 negative, and it might make be wise to \"ablate\" the tumor. They use a technique called High-Frequency Ultrasound (HIFU), which is not approved in the US. He said it is similar to CyberKnife. I have to say, this made a lot of sense to me. My oncologist has raised the possibility of surgery to remove my breast tumor at some point. In my case, since the treatment has shrunk and defanged the tumor somewhat, why would it not make sense to a non-invasive form of surgery? I don't know the answer to this - perhaps someone else here does. Second, the German doctor said that if the rest of the tumor is resolved by my next PET-CT, then that may indicate that the tumor is still responding to the anti-HER2 therapy. In that case, they would want me to send my original tumor biopsy tissue out for analysis - they use TAA screening, which is a kind of genetic testing, I think? At any rate, they use the analysis to develop an anti-HER2 vaccine. The vaccine they develop contains multiple peptides that - attack? suppress? - the tumor cells on multiple fronts. The vaccine approach also differs from antibodies like H&P in that it somehow \"trains\" your cells to identify and attack the HER2 cells on its own (ie - independently, although perhaps in conjunction with, H&P). The \"base\" dose of the vaccine is usually 5 treatments, which can be administered once a month or over 2 weeks. Generally speaking, after the base dose follow-up treatment is every 3, then every 6 months, then every year for 1-3 years. The cost: $25K-$50K for the base dose, then probably $5K for the follow up doses. If my breast tumor proves NOT to be resolved by the next PET-CT, then the German doctor said they would recommend re-biopsying it and running the same TAA analysis on it. Don't worry, I'm not running out to send $50k to Germany. This is just the first step I am taking in a long road of doing more research and having many more discussions with my doctors and my sisters (and brothers) here on breastcancer.org. I would, however, greatly appreciate anything you want to share about your knowledge of this clinic or others, or what more-informed folks on the list might think about the ideas I have outlined here. I found the conversation very informative, and I encourage others to reach out to non-US clinics to explore options.

      "Content": "scrunchthecat wrote: Hello all, I found this article from the Journal of Clinical Oncology while I was innocently surfing the Web last night. It made my blood boil. The first few paragraphs I summarize what it says (the link to the article is there), then after the summary I ask a few pointed questions about the article, and make a couple of suggestions about possible courses of action, if necessary. I am college professor, used to reading academic journal articles, but I am not in a medical field. If someone with a greater understanding can interpret this bullshit in a more nuanced light than I have been able to do, please add your comment. Thanks! Cost-Effectiveness of Pertuzumab in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2\u2013Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2015/09/03/JCO.2015.62.9105.full Corresponding author: Ben Y. Durkee, MD, PhD, Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University, 875 Blake Wilbur Dr, CC-G217, Stanford, CA 94305-5847; e-mail: bydurkee@stanford.edu. Here's the setup: \"We developed a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of docetaxel plus trastuzumab (TH) with or without pertuzumab in US patients with metastatic breast cancer. The model followed patients weekly over their remaining lifetimes. Health states included stable disease, progressing disease, hospice, and death. Transition probabilities were based on the CLEOPATRA study. Costs reflected the 2014 Medicare rates.\" Here's the results: \" Modeled median survival was 39.4 months for TH and 56.9 months for THP. The addition of pertuzumab resulted in an additional 1.82 life-years gained, or 0.64 QALYs, at a cost of $713,219 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that THP is unlikely to be cost effective even under the most favorable assumptions, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted 0% chance of cost effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY gained.\" Here's Wikipedia: \"The quality-adjusted life year or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a generic measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life lived. It is used in assessing the value for money of a medical intervention.\" Here's My Response: I pulled out my insurance statements, which show how much the insurance company is billed for my treatment, and how much they actually pay, based on negotiation with my doctors. (They pay about 50%). The number is still way below $700k per year for Perjeta. So I question the accuracy of the study's numbers. Now, I guess it is possible that the study used Medicare numbers, and as we know, thanks to our worthless Congress, Medicare is not allowed to negotiate for pricing on drugs. So it is possible that the $700k represents the no-negotiation Medicare price. Still, it strikes me as extremely unethical for this article NOT to point out that Medicare prices may be higher than private insurance. It is also *extremely* unethical for the authors to simply conclude that \"it's not worth it to pay for Perjeta\" instead of saying something like, \"the cost of Perjeta must come down to accommodate all US patients, including those on Medicare.\" Here's my exact number breakdown from my insurance company. The top three numbers on my bill (I am going to assume they represent Taxotere, Herceptin and Perjeta) are: $5379.87 (negotiated down from $12,226.98); $6,579.64 (negotiated down from $14, 953.72) and $7,452.89 (negotiated down from $16,938.39). Together the three total $19,412.40 (negotiated down from 44,119.09), which comes to about $330,010.8 per year (negotiated down from $750,024.53 - remember, this is from all three). When I drop Taxotere from the rotation and just continue on H&P, assuming that Taxotere is the cheapest, the single-treatment total drops to $14,032.53 (negotiated down from $31,892.11), or $238,553.01 for a year of H&P (negotiated down from $524,165.87). If we assume that Perjeta is the most expensive, at $7,452.89 (negotiated down from $16,938.39), that's still just $126,699.13 for a year of Perjeta (negotiated down from $287,952.63. NOTE THAT BOTH OF THOSE FINAL NUMBERS ARE WAY LESS THAN $700k. Here's My Action Items: If a couple other people want to provide their yearly totals for Perjeta, I have a few folks I can ask about this. We could make a big stink, but since this is so not my area of academia, I am not sure what the most effective course of action is.
