I hate mammograms - I've always had tender breasts and mammo's were so uncomfortable.  But I've learned over the years (I'm now 49) and with many, many arguments with doctors, radiologists and breast surgeons that mammograms do in fact see what an ultrasound cannot.  And I've had more than I care to recall! Don't be too anxious for biopsy; you fight for that 2nd opinion and get a concensus of what all the different doctors say.  If you have a Breast Clinic in your area (ours is at the UW Clinics) try to see if you can go there for your 2nd opinion - they specialize in this subject so my opinion is they are the ones who can give you the best answers. Good Luck!",

I've had breast issues for years and years.  It started when I was a little younger than you are right now.  Very first thing they did everytime was a mammogram.  I've had too many to count, often times followed up w/ultrasound, and other times referred to Breast Clinic for more evaluation and even surgery.  Other than the lump I had removed that I talked about before, I never had an issue which sounded as frightening as what you are currently going thru.  And I always thought the doctors were all being a little obsessive with all the tests (as you can see by my dx, they were not - everything led to where I sit today recoverying from bilateral mastectomy). I don't understand the \"you're too young\" - perhaps things have changed over the years.  But I wonder if the difference is you keep saying \"doctor\" - are you seeing a GP or OB/GYN doctor or a doctor at a Breast Clinic or Center?  They are the specialists and they are where you should be referred to for your answers if you have not seen them.  If nothing else, they can (and only they can) tell you exactly what they see, why you should not worry, and what your follow up should be. I'm keeping you in my thoughs.  I hope you do assert yourself on seeing a Breast Specialist.  And if you need a core needle biopsy, they are the ones who do them. Keep us informed - keep pushing for anything and everything you need to feel comfortable and at peace, it's your right!!",

I don't know you, nor do I pretend to - but I think we all feel the same things when faced with the possibility of breast cancer.  Please, please see if you can get in to see a Breast Specialist.",

Isn't it amazing how the nurses don't inform you about showering????  I only stayed overnight in the hospital because I figured I'd be more comfortable at home so maybe they were so consumed on informing my husband of everything he needed to know about dressings, drains, etc that they just forgot.  Since I am a wuss when it comes to the incisions and drains and all things gross (I just don't handle those things well!), my husband was put on complete nursing duty once at home.  Just to feel that everything was progressing and all was being taken care of, our insurance did authorize Home Health to come look me over 2 days later and assure my husband he was doing everything correctly.  So glad I had her here to ask about the showering issue!  You should know that if you are still feeling a fair amount of pain you should time your shower about 1/2 to 1 hour after taking pain meds - it helps.  The shower takes a lot out of you; and then the whole \"gosh, I finally feel clean again\" and the warm water.....well, it makes you sleepy afterwards so take that time to get in a good nap.  Since I still have the 2 drains, I'm going to try the saran wrap thing tomorrow as all the other things I've tried let the drains move around too much which then bothers the areas where they are sewn in.  I hate these things so much!!! I hear you about feeling all the pressure on the chest!  I still have that and insane pressure in the upper back.  This was explained to me by the PS and his crew:  \"we yanked and tugged and pulled on the pectoral muscles in ways you can't imagine so yes, you are going to feel pain\".  I still cannot sleep lying on my back because it causes too much pain the following morning (well, actually during the night - only have slept thru the night 2X in 3+ weeks because of the pressure causing pain in the upper back which then transfers to the chest).  The pec muscles that go from the chest up to the shoulders are STILL inflammed.  I'm now on my 3rd anti-inflammatory!  It hurts to have anything even touch it and unless I walk around naked....well, I'm going to hurt.  Hopefully this new nsaid we started on Friday will help take care of this. And the pain you have on the left side; I see you had quite a few nodes removed.  Personally, I don't think there is any way a surgeon can get those out without cutting nerves.  I have nerve damage where my sentinal node was removed on the left side but have been assured the electrical shock like feeling I have going from the incision down the inside of my arm to the elbow area will get better over time.  And it has gotten better but will take time before it stops bothering me so much.  With that, the left chest area also seemed to hurt more so perhaps that's what's going on with you as well. It is a long journey for me.  I'm amazed at the stories I read on some women literally going about their daily lives within days with very little discomfort - I wish I were in that group!  But, alas, I'm not and all I can do is push forward each day as the pain and discomfort lessen a little with time.  Hoping your shower goes well!  I know that first shower I took was so refreshing but it took a lot out of me so nappy time it was when I was done.  Wishing you well and I'll follow your progress!

my right SLN showed positive for cancer, so BS told me he met w/Oncologist before seeing me post surgery and the recommendation is 16 weeks chemo.  Right now, that\u2019s all I know.  BS said I have to wait to see Oncology on 9/16 and they will determine if they will do the Oncontype testing or not.  I\u2019ve read at other posts that because they have Triple Negative Breast Cancer and are under the age of 50 (some say 60) that BRCA testing was done (I asked BS about that and he said \u201cbecause there is no family history of breast cancer in your family, your insurance likely would not cover the cost of the test \u2013 it is very costly\u201d).  Other ladies posts say their insurances didn\u2019t balk at covering the test; but I found sometimes my BS downplayed a lot of stuff so I\u2019ll be asking Oncology about it (my husband got the same feeling from BS \u2013 he is very good and very well respected in our area but even though I\u2019m not a \u201cworst-case scenario cancer patient\u201d \u2013 it devastated our lives hearing the diagnosis and I guess he perhaps was trying to be reassuring but didn\u2019t carry it off very well) \u2013 I DIGRESS\u2026.  Anyway, I just have to be patient and wait to see Oncology on 9/16 to get more definitive answers.  I would like the BRCA testing (and we have very good insurance \u2013 thank God!) and I want a PET Scan \u2013 both would make me more comfortable in having all info possible before putting in place a plan to kill whatever cancer remains.  I feel pretty OK about the recurrence rate percentages w/info I now have but again, Oncology will help me thru this process better.   So that was all very lengthy and I apologize (as you\u2019ve all realized by now, I do go on and on), but Jacquie\u2026.chemo is not the end of the world.  It\u2019s also very effective.  They have come so far in technology, many brave ladies before us paved the way to today\u2019s day and age where they have perfected the therapy and lessened the side effects.  Please take heart in that\u2026..if you need it, we are all here for you and will support and encourage you along the way.  There have been several ladies who just this last couple of days offered their advise and assistance to any of us heading into chemo \u2013 so you have a great support group here if chemo is in your future.  How much did they fill you?  I have my first fill tomorrow\u2026..   Kbeee \u2013 I hope you did not take offense about my statement regarding the fire helmet.  And bless you for your profession!  It was your description that painted a funny picture in my head so please know it was said in jest.  But if you have a chance, take that selfie so we can get a look at your before and afters w/natural hair and new wig and then w/fire helmet (once you\u2019re bald).  And, bless the wonderful men you work with at the fire/paramedic for offering to do the shave.  I love the camaraderie w/first responders \u2013 they\u2019ll all have a good time shaving your head, I think, and it was thoughtful of them to put off the summer picnic so you could attend!  JennH8 \u2013 so happy for you to get 1 drain out!  And you get to shower!!!!!!  I think a lot of us were nervous so look at the posts from this past weekend for some hints.  I also started a thread in Surgery-Before-During and After called \u201cShower Tips\u201d where I\u2019ve listed the many hints I\u2019ve read, those I came up with, and those that others have offered since I stared the thread.  They\u2019re all in one place and split on \u201cwhat to do with your drains\u201d and \u201cshower/hair washing tips\u201d.  You might be less nervous once you read what different things you can do to make it an enjoyable and refreshing experience.  I have never, even one month post surgery, taken a good look straight on \u2013 I just can\u2019t do it.  Not because I no longer have breasts\u2026.it\u2019s the idea of seeing sutures in myself OR any person that makes me want to vomit!  And I have a lot of sutures and none are dissolving; another thing the PS will be doing tomorrow.  Snip, snip \u2013 I literally demanded they snip these off!  I\u2019m tired of them catching of clothing and creating a burning feeling from the friction!  I\u2019ve glanced at all incisions but my husband has been on full nursing duty and been taking care of everything having to do with them since I came home.  I\u2019m not afraid of what I look like\u2026I got a T-Shirt to wear once I have my reconstruction completed that says \u201cYeah, They\u2019re Fake \u2013 my real ones tried to kill me\u201d.  So you can see I\u2019m not upset being w/o breasts or anyone knowing it\u2026.surgery and the aftermath of it just grosses me out to no end!  I hope when you see yourself you remember that your breasts (or lack of) do not define the person within.  I wondered, ladies, I\u2019ve not read in any of our postings about children.  Are any of you having to deal with this new life we find ourselves in while having children at home?  I\u2019ve read on other threads just how hard that\u2019s been for some; I myself could not imagine having a child at home during this time in our lives and having to keep stress and fear and anxiety at bay to keep from scaring a child/children.  Myself\u2026.our daughter is 26 and living over 2000 miles away.  She wanted to come home during all this but I asked her to stay where she was (it is so hard finding employment in the Seattle area and she just started a job less than a year ago and because it is a small, newly formed business, getting time off was going to be an issue).  I knew her love and thoughts were constantly with me and there was little she could do for me.  The housecleaning can be done little by little as I feel up to it, my husbands done his fair share, and quite frankly when I don\u2019t feel well I can get to be a little witchy and prefer to not be around others.  I asked that she wait til Christmas and come home with her boyfriend (soon to be a fiancé, I believe!) then.  He is from Wisconsin as well \u2013 and I think I\u2019ll be smack dab in the middle of chemo and would love to have her with us at that time.  We were supposed to fly out to visit them over the Labor Day weekend but because I\u2019m still recovering (and dragging around these disgusting drains!!!) and because I was told no Air Travel for 2-3 months post surgery \u2013 we had to cancel our trip.  We talk quite often, Skype weekly, but there\u2019s nothing like having your child home for the holidays!!  Please, if you all don\u2019t find it too personal, post if you have children or a child and if you\u2019re having to deal with cancer while you still have them at home.  Wishing everyone a great day!  Thoughts are with you all.  I feel so fortunate to have found this forum and to be able to share with others going thru what I\u2019m going thru!  Lisa",

It\u2019s like the anti-anxiety medication gave me amnesia or something so please forgive me but I need you to tell me everything again because I\u2019ve no memory of talking with you at all.  He kind of chuckled but understood.   My BS wouldn\u2019t let an Oncology appt be made until he met w/me personally to go over finally pathology.  So it\u2019s not uncommon for you to have to wait. Although, there are some very lucky ladies here who seem to have gotten Oncology appts pretty quickly so I guess every facility has diff protocols.  My Oncology appt ended up being 4 weeks after meeting w/BS so I\u2019ll be 1-1/2 months post surgery by time I see her.  Waiting stinks but what can we do when they have their protocols?  I hope your pathology comes back with good news \u2013 can you tell us how you know so much about treatment already?  And since they already put in a port, your initial pathology must have given you some detailed info (I don\u2019t see any diagnosis info on you so if you feel I\u2019m prying, just don\u2019t answer \u2013 I don\u2019t mean to pry but am interested in learning).  To everyone \u2013 thank you so much for sharing about your children!  I\u2019m glad I asked.  It\u2019s nice to know a little about each ones family life and since we share some of our very personal information with one another, I had hoped to gain a little insight of what makes up each of your families.  Wishing you all well and a very good evening.  I\u2019ll check in later to catch up on anything that might get posted while I\u2019m away.  As always, I\u2019m so thankful to be included in this little group.  I never thought I\u2019d be one to share but we all got thrown into this strange, new world unexpectedly.  It shocked me to my core and I\u2019ve found I NEED the support and encouragement of others going thru this journey \u2013 so thank you all for just being there!",

They found my ports which had moved slightly towards the underarm areas (no big deal they said) and the fill procedure itself was quite painless, to my great delight!  My fill was about 2 hours ago and I've yet to feel any pain from either muscle spasms or inflammation (of course this could all change as the day/evening progresses but I'm feeling pretty confident it won't).  Of course, due to my pinched nerves in my lower back, arthritis in the neck, and chronic headaches....I've been on daily muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory meds for almost 10 years.  I'm sure that helps keep whatever pain might be associated with expansions at bay. I asked why I hadn't received any expansion at the time of surgery like most of you and was told because I am so small framed and thin and the pec muscles were shown at time of surgery to not be very pliable, they opted to try to lessen what they knew was going to be considerable post op pain as minimal as possible. I was told if they had gone ahead and done any fill at the time of surgery, my post op pain probably would have been 3 fold of what I actually experienced.  I guess that explains why I got more pain relief taking the anti-inflammatory med, Toradol, than I did taking the pain medication they gave me.  I still have swelling in the pec muscles that run from the breast area up to the shoulder area so I'm most worried about these being aggravated with expansions - but I'll deal with that should it arise. Hope all is well with everyone.  I'll check in later and see how the day went for everybody and update you should my expansion begin to cause any pain. Oh - the nurse also looked at my drains.  She said I am getting really close to having them removed....it's like maybe a teaspoon worth of fluid that needs to decrease yet before removal.  She looked at the fluid that is in my drains and said it looked exactly like they want it to look - getting very clear.  So I'm almost there!!!  And hopefully this expansion will take up some of that dead space to lessen the fluid output so by this week I could be jumping up and down with joy of not having surgical paraphenilia hanging out of me or lugging these stupid drains around my waist - that what we're all hoping for anyway.",

Does that sound like the type of pain you are having?   I can\u2019t believe you had no drains \u2013 did he or the nurse explain why?  (you\u2019ll find I\u2019m obsessed w/drains\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve been tied to mine now for nearly 5 weeks while I watch all the other ladies here get theirs out 1-2 weeks post op \u2013 very depressing!).  Your comment on your surgeon sounds familiar to me as well.  I had/have great faith in him and he is very well respected in our area.  He communicated very well in all areas except that he had a tendency to downplay quite a bit (which I didn\u2019t know of course until pathology reports came back).  I\u2019ve come to accept, with the help of listening to others in this forum, that he probably just didn\u2019t want to answer my questions because he felt they were more directed and Oncology should answer them \u2013 but the way he minimal zed things at the time was very frustrating to me.  He should have just said \u201cyou\u2019ll need to speak with Oncology about that\u201d \u2013 oh well, he was a great BS and I\u2019m glad I had his skills to take care of me.  Again, I\u2019m so glad you found us.  It took me almost 3 weeks before I found this lovely group of ladies but I\u2019m so very thankful I did!  It has done me a wealth of good being able to connect with others going thru what I\u2019m going thru, at the same time.  We are able to bounce things off one another and I believe we have developed as quite a support group for one another.  I hope you find the same!  Mrtw43 \u2013 your pain does sound familiar but mine is not in rib cage.  It\u2019s all the \u201cyanking and pulling\u201d getting the TE\u2019s placed and then getting the pec muscle closed back up \u2013 that\u2019s what every member of my medical team has explained.  And it makes sense; but you did not have that type of reconstructive surgery so it\u2019s odd we are experiencing similar effects from our surgeries.  I don\u2019t believe the description you received that \u201cit was from all the \u201cdigging\u201d around sounds like the culprit and I say that because all the nerves were cut and we should technically be numb which in my simple mind tells me any of the \u201cdigging\u201d or \u201cscraping\u201d they did should not be a cause of our pain.  But I\u2019m like you, again, when it comes to sleeping (I only just slept on my full back for the first time 3 nights ago and I\u2019m over 4 weeks post op!) and I still get all that, what I would call \u201cpressure\u201d (not pain at this point) in the upper back and chest.  With my recent expansion of TE\u2019s, it appears my upper back is what is being affected first and that pain transfers to the front, upper chest area.   I don\u2019t know a whole lot about the Deip reconstruction process as I knew I didn\u2019t want to go that route\u2026..do they cut into your pectoral muscle at all when they do that?   Kbeee and others regarding PS \u2013 I hope I didn\u2019t open a can of worms, there.  I do, however, believe I did blindly follow what BS and PS were telling me to do prior to surgery but please remember I literally \u201cfell apart\u201d and was put on anti-anxiety meds during the 2 weeks between diagnosis and surgery (not that I couldn\u2019t think for myself \u2013 I could and did \u2013 I\u2019m just explaining I needed something to help me get thru that horrible waiting period and all the \u201cwhat-if\u2019s\u201d).  I had actually, and my husband does not even know this, decided I didn\u2019t want any reconstruction because I didn\u2019t feel I knew enough about it and my pre-op appointments was to be the time I was going to say I wasn\u2019t going to go thru with it.  I lost it during those 2 appointments; completely lost it.  I just completely fell apart and felt so overwhelmed at everything but the BS and PS were very thoughtful but a little taken aback because I had been so strong previous to this but I never spoke up about my reservations w/reconstruction.  I met w/PS first and after we discussed the procedure (and at this point I realized if I didn\u2019t do reconstruction now, I probably never would so I just needed to \u201cget strong\u201d and get this done) I agreed to have it done.  I asked what questions I had, but they in no way encompassed everything I\u2019ve learned since.  And I shouldn\u2019t have to ask any questions \u2013 it is their job to inform the patient of everything.  But don\u2019t get me wrong, I really really like my PS, his PAC, and his entire staff \u2013 they are a wonderful group and again, very well respected in our area. But I wonder if because we were newly diagnosed and having to deal with everything associated with that alone, if perhaps PS tries to cover all bases in THEIR minds and they don\u2019t want us to get bogged down with their part in all this.  And I\u2019ll be the first to say, I was so totally consumed with \u201cget this cancer out of me\u201d that PS was an after-thought and I purposely didn\u2019t do much research on it \u2013 so maybe they are more apt to just get the basic info to us at the time and we can get to the point of more questions/concerns AFTER the surgery when most of us have had our cancer removed (or mostly removed \u2013 I know I may still have some elsewhere in my body having had one node test positive).  Maybe \u2013 I\u2019m trying to give the benefit of the doubt to them because I know I was more concerned with the cancer at the time than I was about reconstruction.  I hope I didn\u2019t unnecessarily cause anyone to doubt their PS in any way \u2013 not my intention but wondered what others were told after I heard they choose the final implant that best suits my body.  After I had a day or 2 to take that in, it just sounded wrong to me and I wanted your opinions and what you have been told.  So, please, don\u2019t let what I brought up cause anyone to doubt their PS\u2026.if you think it means you have more questions for them then it\u2019s a good thing I brought this up because I believe we all must be fully informed!  Friday\u2019s expansion update:  I have to say, I\u2019m feeling better than I expected (given all the post op pain I had).  The bad soreness set in about 6-8 hours after expansion but within 24 hours, I feel basically the same I did prior to expansion.  And\u2026..guess what, ladies\u2026..my drainage has FINALLY slowed down!  Had 25ml in one drain and 30ml in the other in 24 hours from Friday evening to Saturday evening.  Know what that means?  If this stays the same today\u2026.I get the drains out on Monday.  So please, if all you good ladies could cross your fingers, legs, toes or anything else you can physically cross for my benefit\u2026.I\u2019d appreciate it.  Good Gosh, I\u2019d rub a Buddha\u2019s belly at this point!!!!  I have been wearing a tube top for compression since Friday as well so maybe that and the expansion filling up some of that dead space was just what I needed.  I\u2019ll let you know on Monday if I can join your group of \u201cI got my drains removed\u201d!  Hoping everyone has a wonderful Sunday.  Keeping everyone in my thoughts and prayers!

It seems clear that the only consistent thing with our PS\u2019s is inconsistency.  However, from what I\u2019ve read it seems they all wait about 4 weeks post op for your first post op expansion.  They want to  make sure you\u2019ve had a good amount of time to heal and I\u2019m guessing that the healing inside might take longer than what we see on the surface \u2013 so I think you might be about 2 weeks away from your first post op fill.  Pam358 \u2013 Thanks for the info regarding what you discussed w/MO.  It makes me feel as though, knowing that now, that I need to speak up right from the start and let my doctors know I want to be informed on everything.  I can\u2019t imagine why any patient wouldn\u2019t want to know\u2026\u2026  And congrats to you for getting your drain removed on Friday!!  And I bet that shower felt awesome!!!!!  Jo6202 \u2013 thanks for winging those thoughts skyward on my behalf!  I really, really want these drains gone!!!  Did you get your surgery set up yet?  I believe you were supposed to get a surgery date set up on Friday but I don\u2019t see any update\u2026\u2026..  First Expansion Update \u2013 I gotta say, I am so pleasantly surprised by how it went.  Yes, I was very sore 6-8 hours after the expansion.  It lasted for about 24 hours and that was it \u2013 other than some little tension in the right/upper back, I feel the same as I did before the expansion.  We are all different, but hoping the same is for each one of you when you get your first expansion (I believe Jacquie had a very painful time of it so it just goes to show \u2013 you don\u2019t know until your time comes).  But my best wishes to each of you that you breeze thru it as I did!!!!  Have a great evening!!!!!",

Honeybair \u2013 you keep talking about this itching.  Is it itching?  I have worn my foobs the last 2 days and today I was out of my mind and could not get out of work fast enough today to get home and get the darn things off.  I had described it as itching in the past but it\u2019s not\u2026.what it feels like is that someone has put strips of tight tape on my chest incisions and it feels like it\u2019s shrinking and I want to rip it off \u2013does that sound like what you have?  Not only do I have that feeling when I wear the foobs in a tube top (with pockets for inserts) but I have the same darn feeling even wearing a simple, soft cotton shirt.  It is driving me insane and I don\u2019t think I can wear the foobs anymore (and I hate looking like a patient who just had a BMX \u2013 even though that\u2019s exactly what I am).  But I just can't stand wearing the foobs!  So\u2026.I took Babs suggestion and got some silicone inserts.  Not foobs, but silicone \u201cincreasers\u201d \u2013 they are hollow and my plan is to use those in the pockets of the tube tops so that there is less pressure on my chest.  I\u2019ll let you know how it works.  Oh \u2013 see\u2026.I cannot wear a bra yet because\u2026..that\u2019s right ladies, I still have tubes and drains!  I was told no bra until 10 days after tubes are removed so I bought some tube tops.   Pam358 \u2013 It is strange how different doctors have different tests, regimens, etc.  But, I guess we\u2019re all different which might explain some of why they are so different.   I hear you about mets.  That\u2019s my biggest worry as well.  I\u2019m scared, I\u2019ll admit it, that I\u2019m going to hear it has spread to one or more of my organs.  But I have faith in God and ask daily for his Grace to live the life he has planned for me with dignity and courage.  Whatever that is.  Jeannine \u2013 Boy oh boy, it is good to hear from you!  I was getting worried and was going to send a PM if I didn\u2019t see any posting by week end.  So glad you are doing well and congrats on getting the drains removed \u2013 and I\u2019m sure that shower rocked!  You sound good \u2013 I\u2019m glad you got your mother settled in someplace you are comfortable with and that you can concentrate on yourself now.  We missed you! Aviva \u2013 it\u2019s probably for the best that your appt was delayed.  Get the test results first (are you sure the hospital got the right tissue this time?) and then meet w/MO \u2013 do it all in one shot. I'm glad you were able to discuss the TE's with your PS and you know it is nothing for you to worry about. Have you had any luck shopping for caps?  NewHopeAndrea \u2013 I have had several discussions with my PS regarding the issue of keeping still to keep fluid output down.  I am in agreement with what they told me \u2013 there is no medical evidence to back that theory up.  I\u2019ve twice during my recovery had to sit/lay with my feet inclined for 24+ hours to bring down unknown swelling since surgery in my feet/ankles/calves.  The fluid output those days was exactly the same as the days I go to work and do chores around the house.  There is no rhyme or reason on why it outputs what it does, why one might be high for 2 days then decrease but then the other drain goes up (discharge nurse at hospital told us the same thing \u2013 she said \u201cdon\u2019t try to figure it out, there is no reason why they do what they do and you\u2019ll only drive yourself crazy\u201d.  Having had my remaining 2 drains for 5 weeks (5 weeks exactly today), I can attest there is no rhyme or reason\u2026\u2026and as much as I want them out, I don\u2019t want them removed just to end up getting fluid built up and then having to chance aspiration that could cause issues w/TE\u2019s.  I hate these things, but I\u2019d hate it more if I ended up getting them removed then having too much fluid and possibly getting infections.  Or worse yet, getting infection and having to have TE\u2019s removed.  I feel for what you\u2019ve had to endure \u2013 I hope my fluids just ease up for several days and I can get them removed and still be comfortable that something bad isn\u2019t going to happen (know what I mean)?  And I hear you on the yogurt thing too!  Tried my best but after 3 weeks, yes\u2026that thing happened that is all too common w/some of us when taking antibiotics happened.  Just a little something to make my life more miserable \u2013 but we took care of that little problem and I still eat 2 large yogurts a day hoping to ward off that little evil from showing up again (I too have issues w/my GI from the antibiotic) \u2013 seems sometimes we just can\u2019t win!!! Oh \u2013 you made me so squirm with your replay of the tubes and the doorknob!!!!!  Holy S*** - you know I was so afraid of that it wasn\u2019t funny!  I had my PS cut my tubes down (they were so long they would have hung below my knees if left to hang, for goodness sakes) at week 2.  I accidentally grabbed my belt (which had 4 drains at the time) and pulled down the night of my surgery in the hospital when going to the bathroom \u2013 so I have to say I perhaps was quite thankful for the long tubes at that particular moment \u2013 but at home (knowing I have been so incredibly careful at potty time since that little incident in the hospital) I was sick of them dangling all over and worried about\u2026..DOORKNOBS!  I can\u2019t believe that actually happened to you \u2013 you poor thing!  I would have had many choice words, yes, many very bad choice words would have spewed from my mouth \u2013 just because it was such a huge fear and can\u2019t figure out why they leave those things so long \u2013 what is the purpose of having 3 feet worth of tubing?????? You really made me squirm, I\u2019m not kidding.  Your story and Jeannine\u2019s infection and surgery are the 2 things that worried me most and I am thankful nothing every came from them (and I\u2019m knocking on wood they don\u2019t since I\u2019m still w/my 2 drains).  Thanks for sharing your story with us. Poodle_Mum - did you get a chance to search either BCO or Google on the breast massage?  Or did you find an interpreter to contact your BS to make sure you had the instructions correct?  I hope you find the answers you're looking for and I hope your surgeon takes the time to assure you about your concerns. As always, if I forgot anyone it was unintentional and I\u2019ll catch up on the next posting.  Congrats to all who have showered, and all who have their drains removed, and all that are on their journey w/Oncology and have their therapies in place (while some of us still wait and wait and wait).  Peace to all and God Bless.

Please, get yourself medical care asap.  You are in my prayers - you've had a tough time of things and my heart goes out to you.  Please, please get to a doctor.  You don't know how long it will take for your surgeon to get your email so it could be later this afternoon before he even sees it; then it takes an hour to drive there.... - you should not wait, poodle-mum.  You need care now.

Saw Oncology and my head is spinning - chemo starts a week from tomorrow.  She is ordering BRCA testing - said it is very unusual for someone my age to be Triple Negative and have cancer in both breasts at the same time.  If I carry the gene, my remaining ovary will be removed after a safe amount of time following chemo.  She is putting in an order for a PET Scan so we have a baseline.  Ordering an EKG prior to chemo as one of the meds used can be hard on the heart and since there is heart disease in my family she wants this checked.  Got a tour of the chemo ward - and you'd think everything is set to go.  But..... Here's the thing.  The initial biopsies done before surgery showed micro IDC.  Those tissues were used for all the hormonal testing.  The BMX biopsies showed IDC much more extensive than originally thought and therefore she wants those tissues to have the hormone testing done on to verify the TNBC.  She said there is an outside chance some part of the tumor may test positive and that changes the whole plan.  She's not hopeful, but feels since it was so much more extensive it's worth a second look just to make certain. Oh, and right at beginning of appt she asked how recovery was going and said \"I see you still have your drains\" to which I said \"not anymore!  came right here from PS where they finally removed them\".  Then she said to my husband and I \"you have broken all records of any of the patients I've seen thru the years.  I've never had a patient go beyond 3 weeks and I feel for you having had to deal with that for 6 weeks\".  Yeah, BUT THERE GONE NOW!!!!!!  I AM SO HAPPY!!!!!! Really, my head is spinning with everything we talked about and I was shocked when she said we are moving forward right now as TNBC and chemo beginning next week.  Then I received a binder FULL of all the info I need to know or may want to know (I don't think I can get thru it in a week!).  So spent afternoon running to PS office- I knew one drain was ready but told them when I called this morning I was unsure if the other was but when I got there, my PS was actually in clinic and came right in to see me, looked at my incisions, looked at my drains and said \"we're taking them both out today - you should be just fine\".  I could have kissed him!  I refrained but heartily shook his hand and kept saying \"thank you\" over and over again.  Then ran to MO and spent over 2 hours there, ran to pharmacy to pick up new meds, got home and called our daughter to give her the news, ate and it's now going on 8:30.  I'm beat! So, I'll catch up on everything that was posted today when I have some time tomorrow.  poodle-mum - been thinking of you all day and hope you are doing OK! Hope everyone is doing well and had a great day!  As always, my thoughts and prayers to all!",

Aviva \u2013 I do hope they used the right tissue this time!  That would really stink if the hospital erred again!  I know nothing about what the results mean but apparently you do and it sounds good so that\u2019s great news!!!!  Don\u2019t be silly about feeling guilty!  Gosh, we all couldn\u2019t be happier for you.  You do that happy dance (once you know the right tissue was used, of course) and know we dance in spirit right along with you.  It\u2019s nice to hear some GOOD news with one of us and I do hope you avoid the chemo, I\u2019m really very happy for you! Kbeee \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of you and will be there in spirit tomorrow night.  You really do have a loving group of individuals at the Fire Station as well as in your community \u2013 I hope you have a roarin\u2019 party!!!  You crack me up w/your running and what you said to your BS!  You\u2019re a strong lady and it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s anything that could keep you down \u2013 I stand in awe of you! Wrenn \u2013 Yes, I have very little time to stew about things.  I didn\u2019t see that coming!  With all the waiting we do I expected another waiting game before getting started w/chemo so it really threw me that she wants to start next week.  But, even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get thru the binder she went over the most important things with me and when all is said and done, I don\u2019t feel like I have a choice.  Not interested in taking any chances and the recurrence rate is too high to not do chemo (for me personally \u2013 others might feel diff and I\u2019ve no problem with that).  I can cut that 27% chance down to a 12% chance so I\u2019m going for it!  I see it as a life saving measure and I want to be a Grandma one day so I need to stick around a while longer!  Just so much happening so fast but I would stew on it if the time were there so it\u2019s best this way. Good for you with your walk!  Funny how things happen, isn\u2019t it?  Like I\u2019ve said, we all have that turning point and it sound like you had yours \u2013 now let\u2019s just get that last drain done and over with!  True, you\u2019re likely not going to be able to shower right away but they told me yesterday that the hole, under normal circumstances, should close in about 24 hours.  So only a couple days after that tube comes out you should be able to safely shower.  And the area needs to be kept clean (which is why I find it so strange some of the PS\u2019s don\u2019t allow showers when you still have tubes) and showering is the easiest way to get that done.  Beats having to take Q-tips or something to clean specifically that area and seems safer to clean it in the shower.  I just don\u2019t understand the theory but I\u2019m certain there is a legitimate reason.  But that first shower is going to be such a blessing when you get it!!!!!!  Am I rested \u2013 well, no.  I\u2019ve been up since midnight.  That darn antibiotic!  I was rudely awaken and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom and I could not get back to sleep so I\u2019ve been up for too long and am exhausted. Update\u2026.So, I get home from work and try to just rest for a little bit since I was up most of the night.  My Insurance Coordinator calls and we need to go over everything that MO wants done so she can get all the referrals in place.  So after that, I try to rest a bit\u2026.but the phone rings about ½ later and I was in the bathroom (again) and couldn\u2019t get it in time.  Go pick up the receiver and see that there are 5 messages that came in this morning.  All stemming from my Oncology appt yesterday\u2026. Seems my MO wants a port placed for chemo and I don\u2019t want it (and declined it when BS offered it at post op visit) and she must not have realized I was missing one when she did physical exam yesterday (and I sure as heck didn\u2019t bring it up!).  BS looked at my arms at post op exam and said \u201cthat\u2019s fine, you have good veins and they can administer that way\u201d.  The nurse who gave me tour of chemo ward looked at my veins as well and said \u201cno problem\u201d.  Well, all 5 messages that came in while I was at work were the CancerCenter calling saying my MO wants a port place and they contacted my BS office and actually scheduled the procedure for Friday.  I know I probably sound like a baby but I DO NOT WANT A PORT \u2013 I freak with the idea of a foreign object imbedded in my chest and don\u2019t want it.  I called MO office and left message saying just that \u2013 she is going to pass the message on to MO and I\u2019m waiting to hear back.  I want everyone to leave my chest alone for a while \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in someone cutting into it again nor do I want something else foreign in there.  The TE\u2019s are difficult enough!  I\u2019m so frightened I\u2019m going to hear that they INSIST I have it for \u201csafety\u201d reasons\u2026\u2026did any of you do chemo without a port?  And my sides burn\u2026.I expected to feel great after getting tubes removed but that\u2019s not quite how I feel \u2013 far from it.  My PS made it very clear he wanted me to take it easy the next few days and cancelled my next expansion and was adamant no heavy lifting.  He wants to wait 2 weeks between drain removal and expansion so that\u2019s fine.  I\u2019ve not overdone it today and have done NO heavy lifting, but just stretching to reach for something aggravates my sides terribly.  They are just so sore probably from having the tubes so long and then just getting them out aggravated the area \u2013 but I wanted to feel great.  Was that really too much to expect?  Does this nightmare never end? OK \u2013 like I said I\u2019ve been up all night and I sound crabby \u2013 sorry about that!  Just \u201cletting it out\u201d\u2026.. I really do hope everyone else is having a better day.  I\u2019ll check in later with hopes of seeing just that!!",

And my day continued to get worse.  Chemo moved to Thurs the 26th because need to PET Scan and EKG and they couldn\u2019t get scheduled until the 24th.  So next week Tuesday all day in appointments, Thursday 4-5 hours at chemo w/2 hours drive time, then a trip down on Friday for Neupogen if they can\u2019t find me a better option.  There\u2019s more \u2013 I got my flu shot today (my employer hires Home Health to come in and do a Flu Clinic for all employees trying to keep everybody healthy for the flu season) and I knew I needed it before starting chemo, but I\u2019m overdue for Tetanus so I have to get that done this Friday.  There\u2019s even more\u2026..MO never called me back but I got a call from Anesthesiology to interview me for Friday\u2019s surgery (which I\u2019m not having but nobody seems to understand that!).  I thought my head was spinning yesterday.  Really, how the heck did everything spiral so far out of control in a matter of an 8 hour work day?  I\u2019m a wreck (and I must be so overtired because I couldn\u2019t sleep \u2013 can anyone say stress?)   Tomorrow has to get better\u2026\u2026  As always, my thoughts and prayers with all of you.  And again, Avita, I am so very happy for you!",

Reason my sides felt like they were burning - well, changed the dressing and the right side hurt the worst and sure enough, there was pus on the dressing.  I get infections so easy yet held off any major infection for 6 weeks w/the dang drains!  It just looks like a surface infection and we're keeping neosporin on them to keep drawing out any icky stuff - and kept to a sponge bath yesterday and today so as not to get anything in these holes until they are closed up.  I feel soooo sorry for you Wrenn - that you are still having to keep to sponge baths for so long - just having to resort to that for a couple days has been a pain I cannot imagine the month you've had to do this. OK - I gotta get some work done this afternoon but wanted to let everyone know the news on the port.  I'll check in with everyone later on tonight. Lisa",

      "Content": "Sep 20, 2013 03:54AM - edited Sep 20, 2013 03:54AM by LiLi1964 Wrenn \u2013 I am so happy for you!!!!  I believe our little group is now ALL completely free of tubes and drains \u2013 HURRAY!!!! Ah \u2013 anti-anxiety med.  Got it.  I had to take something for anxiety for the stereotactic biopsies as well as the sentinal lymph node injections and mappings.  Helped very well \u2013 I actually was put on a low dose between hearing \u201cyou have cancer\u201d and the surgery.  Can\u2019t say it really did anything, but perhaps it did.  I felt as though I completely fell apart during those 2 weeks but maybe it would have been worse had I not been on the medication.  Glad you\u2019re dressing didn\u2019t soak thru.  Hopefully it keeps up that way and good to know it was nothing to worry about (hey). (that \u201chey\u201d is from your southern neighbor \u2013 we are often mistaken as Canadians here in Wisconsin).  Honeybair \u2013 I understand the whole benefit thing w/a chemo port.  But I also believe that it\u2019s easier for THEM \u2013 not necessarily for the patient.  I will not be getting Herceptin (I\u2019m Triple Negative) \u2013 I could if I wanted to participate in a current study but I just can\u2019t do that (it would require weekly chemo for the 2nd round AND weekly round trips to the Cancer Center for a year).  The study is to see if they can get sub-groupings in the Triple Negative cancer patients and there is some idea that Herceptin may be able to assist in trying to do that).  They can use my veins \u2013 they are healthy and if something happens that makes them unhealthy, we\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when the time comes.  I respect each person\u2019s opinion but I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right for me. That chest thing I kept talking about\u2026..well, it\u2019s pretty much gone.  How, you might ask?  I believe it was the tubes!  When they removed them earlier this week, I hardly felt anything in my sides.  But I said to the nurse \u201cI felt that pulling in my chest\u201d.  She replied \u201cYeah, I actually could see it unwinding in your chest as I was pulling it out\u201d.  Yeah, that was weird.  Stranger yet, that tape across the chest feeling is practically gone!  I didn\u2019t realize it for a couple days but then I got a message from my family doctor asking how I was feeling and it dawned on me, my chest wasn\u2019t bothering me anymore.  So \u2013 seems it was the tubes causing that terrible feeling. I feel terrible you are not able to sleep in bed yet!  I took to my bed a couple of weeks ago but was not comfortable until the removed the tubes.  I know that \u201craw\u201d feeling, though.  But I have back problems so the recliner was getting to be too uncomfortable I had no choice but to try the bed so I could try to stretch out a little \u2013 and it has helped.  But you\u2019re at about the same time post surgery that I was when I went back to sleeping in the bed \u2013 perhaps you can try it but keep several pillows behind you to prop you up.  And a pillow wasn\u2019t good enough to keep my knees propped up so I took some flannel sheets and folded them as a \u201cbolster\u201d and they stayed \u201cput\u201d so I wouldn\u2019t slide down during the night.  I hope you get back to your bed soon!!! Coffeelatte \u2013 thanks for your info on that tight tape feeling.  I\u2019ve been complaining about it but it appears to have been the tubes that were in for 6 weeks.  The feeling is almost gone now that the tubes were removed \u2013 I will hope it stays that way.  If not, I thank you for your input and will keep it in mind if things start feeling \u201ctight and painful\u201d again.  KBeee \u2013 thanks for responding to my PM \u2013 I\u2019m not on facebook but will certainly consider joining just to see the photos!  I\u2019m thinking of you today and praying your chemo goes well!!  I\u2019ll be joining you in the Sept 2013 Chemo thread but I don\u2019t want to go there until after my first chemo.  I\u2019m sure there are experiences there I don\u2019t want to read about beforehand\u2026\u2026  but I\u2019ll be seeing you there (I too will not leave this thread \u2013 I feel I\u2019ve found some very dear friends in sharing our experiences and want to keep updated with how everyone is doing in their journeys). Aviva \u2013 That cartoon syringe \u2013 funny!  It would have scared the crap out of me had I not known it was simply filled with saline.  My biggest fear was pain of the needle going into the port.  I, too, found it very easy and painless but it is a bit intimidating when you see it all laid out on the tray\u2026..  I have to wait another 2 weeks since my PS wants 2 weeks between tube removal and next expansion.  I think my chemo schedule is going to push my next expansion back another week \u2013 I swear it will take forever just to get the \u201cbaby boobs\u201d I\u2019ve heard others have.  Oh well, I always was a late bloomer!  Babs \u2013 My deepest sympathy on your loss.  It is so sad when bad things happen and there are no words that can truly express my sympathies so I use the only words I can.  You are so right \u2013 we need to live each day to the fullest and we often lose sight of that until reminded, usually by a death.  I hope your sister in law passed peacefully and it\u2019s important to remember she is in peace and is now pain-free.  May her memory live on in those she left behind\u2026\u2026 As for me \u2013 I\u2019m all set.  My Care Manager contacted me yesterday and the Genetic Counseling has been approved so we move forward with that.  I need to run and get my Tetanus booster today.  Tuesday is the PET Scan and EKG. Thursday is chemo.  Friday \u2013 oh, my insurance company was able to get a plan in place so I can get my Neupogena injections at my family doctors office (hurray!) \u2013 so Friday I get my injection.  Also have an appt at UW to get fitted for a wig (yeah, I\u2019ll try one just in case when I\u2019m finally \u201chair challenged\u201d I feel I need the look of hair).  So I have a very busy week ahead.  Finally slept!  It required a little help from a couple of pills, but hey, after 6 weeks of only sleeping 4 hours a night I didn\u2019t care.  Asked my doctor for some Ambien \u2013 it didn\u2019t help at all the first night but nights 2 and 3 \u2013 it finally kicked in and I\u2019ve slept 8-9 hours each of those nights.  Amazing what sleep can do to make a person feel better!  I didn\u2019t bother asking for this help when I still had the drains \u2013 they were that uncomfortable I knew sleeping pills wouldn\u2019t even help so why bother.  But it feels good to finally have gotten decent rest.  Again, good luck in chemo today, KBeee.  Wrenn \u2013 I hope your chemo training went well and helped calm some of your fears!  Hoping everyone has a great and healthy day.  My thoughts and prayers are with you all!  If I forgot anyone I apologize.  I've been busy with work and sleeping so I've not been able to keep as up to date here as I had been previously.",

Since you will likely be participating in the Oct 2013 Chemo thread and I'll be in the Sept, I do hope you'll continue to post here so you and I can keep tabs on how each is progressing.  I didn't specifically offer to take any unpopular time; I just took what they gave me.  It sounds very convenient for me, however, since it is on Thursdays and I'm told with the meds being used that days 2-4 are going to be the bad fatigue days so that falls right on the weekend (which is what I wanted).  It also works out best for work; it is the day that is least disruptive for my not being in the office and then my husbands work schedule has him off every other Friday and that will allow him to drive me to my family doctor for the Neupogen injection if I'm not feeling up to making that drive.  I'm scheduled for the first morning appt; labs at 8:10, meet with MO at 8:50 and chemo to follow.  So that SHOULD mean that everything should run smoothly since there is very little that can set back my MO's schedule to delay things (I love 1st morning appointments!).  So all in all, it seems like it is going to work out very well.  Given, of course, that I remain on that schedule (like others have said, anything could change along the way). One of the women where my husband works also had breast cancer 3 years ago.  She told him today that she, too, was triple negative and made the same decision as I to not have a chemo port.  However, there were problems and she ended up having to get one.  She told my husband to tell me \"the port is the Cat's Meow\" - she highly recommends it as it made the experience much more tolerable.  That's good to know - it's encouraging to hear others experiences should the need arise that I have to end up getting one.  I spoke with my Care Manager yesterday late afternoon and asked her \"if something comes up that I need to have a port, do any of the surgeons at the UW insert them in the arm\"?  Her response was that she has never heard of anyone getting a placement there - so I'm thinking that will not be an option if the need arises that I must get one.  Not encouraging - because I really don't want anymore surgeries on my chest.  So I'm just hoping and praying that my veins stay healthy and will get me thru this. Wrenn - you and I think a lot alike, I'm finding out.  I think I learn quite a lot from everyone here and actually feel more prepared when I meet with my doctors because of the different conversations we have here - I am continually thankful I decided to \"check this site out\" even though it took me 3 weeks post-op but it's so important to connect with others going thru the same thing at the same time and we're able to bounce things off one another.  Do you perhaps know why, since you and I are the only triple negative's here, we have different meds being used?  I'm really very niave about how chemo meds are chosen and I'm just curious because I would have expected you and I to be receiving the same therapy.  But Pam is on the same medications and schedule so she and I will be able to \"compare notes' along the way - I feel better knowing \"one of my ladies\" (as you all have affectionatly been designated as in our house) will be with me in this journey.  I know, we're all different, but it still gives me comfort that Pam will be a companion going thru the same regimine as myself. KBeee - I'm so glad your first chemo went well.  Can you tell me something, though?  You said you iced your hands and feet and chewed on ice.  Then you said you wrapped yourself in a warm blanket.  Can you tell me why you iced your hands and feet?  And is that, along with chewing on ice, what made you chilled that you wrapped up in a warm blanket? Also, how long did your chemo take?  And were you sent home with any medications for likely side effects they anticipate you might experience?  Sorry for all the questions.....but your the 1st post surgery chemo in our group.  I hope that the SE's that you experienced so far are all that come.  That would be nice for you and encouraging for the rest of us that will be following in your footsteps.  Is your head staying warm enough?  I know the weather here in WI turned a little chilly....I assume Iowa is the same - so curious if your \"hair challenged\" head is feeling the chill. How is that \"angry\" looking scar, by the way?  Is it looking any \"happier\"?  Poodle-mum - haven't seen a post from you for a while....I hope everything is OK.  Perhaps you're out and about more with your little buddy......sure would like to hear how you're doing. Take care everyone!",

Wrenn - I hope you are getting the best of care in the hospital and things are progressing for the better.  I so feel for you - you feel like an adopted sister to me since we've had so many common issues and thoughts in this journey.  I continue to keep you in my prayers and if we lived closer, I swear I would be by your side helping in any way I could!!!!  I want nothing but the best for you and I know you have your fears in this whole situation (as we all do) but if there is anything I could do from so far away, please ask.  I'll do anything to make it easier for you.  You take care of yourself, get plenty of rest, and update us when you feel up to it, please! KBeee - yes, my husband will be by my side during chemo.  Honestly though, he likes to nap and I'm sure he will take full advantage of the 4 hours to do just that!  We had to be at the UW Hospital for my PET Scan this morning and we picked up ALL the scones they had in the cafeteria (these are the BEST scones I have ever had in my life - had them years ago when I had surgery and my husband brought one up for me instead of the icky hospital food offered and I've been hooked since).  I figured they would be a great thing to have w/me during chemo because they are filling, they are starchy (help calms the tummy) and they are a treat for me - I deserve one w/what I'm going thru!   I've asked him to closely watch the Adriamycin at the IV line for any redness or swelling because I've heard if you see that the nurse needs to be immediately notified.  Why did I ask him to do this?  Because I have that in my head now and MAY see something happening that is not actually happening so I don't want to cry wolf when there is no wolf - he is more level-headed that way so he's in charge of that (that's the short infusion, isn't it?).  I have told my husband the next chemo he can come in to get me started.  Once that is done, I'm sending him over for the 15 minute drive to the UW Cafeteria to snag as many scones as possible so I can freeze them to have on hand for future chemo sessions. I will treat myself to 1 (or more) between chewing ice. Jeanine - I'm keeping your little concoction in mind should I need it.  Sounds gross - but if it takes care of the problem, that's all I care about!  Jo - So sorry to hear your son had to have chemo - that had to be very difficult for you.  I have a little worry about the nausea; my MO said there are several very effective ones but some of those have side effects of headaches....and she wants to avoid using those if possible to keep my headaches from flaring during all this.  However, given a choice of spending a lot of time over the porcelain throne....I think I'll take my chance w/headaches (they can always give me something stronger to keep those from getting too bad for the short period of time needed - I hope it's a short period of time....????) Aviva - I did the same thing w/2 weeks of 1/2 days; it was actually at my employer\u2019s request.  He knew I was having a difficult time w/recovery and didn't want me doing too much at work that could delay my full recovery.  And I too had an issue w/doors; it is so amazing how heavy they are and we never realized it before!  I've gained enough strength BUT if it is a \"push\" door....I still use my backside to push it open instead of putting the pressure on my arms and therefore, chest.  And I'm glad my employer made the suggestion of 1/2 days for 2 weeks because I needed it after all.  Having finally been able to sleep w/aid of sleeping pills that 2nd week; I was fully able to handle full-time this week.  And it feels great to be back to some normality (even though there is an insane amt of work to catch up on!).  I hope your energy returns soon - how did you sleep last night, by the way? Honeybair - did you try the bed again last night or go back to the recliner?  I do hope you begin getting some decent sleep soon - and that you can get comfortable and back to bed to get that rest you so desperately need! Here's another concern I have:  I've been taking generic Claritin for probably 7 years as well as Prilosec.  Do you think those 2 will be less effective for bone pain and acid reflux because I've been taking them so long already?  All these worries! Oh, I asked the MO nurse about chewing ice and she said that some people do that - so I asked if they had crushed ice there.  Her answer, \"no but we have the cubes that we can let sit in water to soften up\" - so I said I would just bring my own crushed ice.  She said they have heated blankets so I don't need to worry about that - and I've opted to not ice my feet and hands (I'll take my chances there).  Reason for that is I've read that cold hands can cause the veins to be less receptive to the IV's and I want my veins as receptive as possible!  I have an actual \"chemo box\" here at home filled with food that I want my husband to keep his hands off of!  High Protein/High Calorie foods, raisins, craisins, salty pretzels, salty tortilla chips (I hear the steroids make people crave salty foods), Nuts, Cinn/Sugar Graham Crackers and other misc items.  I hope I'm prepared enough for what might come my way. I had a long talk w/my daughter yesterday and she wants me to try essential oils - I have to get that approved w/MO.  One thing she told me is that Clove and Oregano are GREAT anti-fungals.....my hope is to avoid Thrush.  So instead, since I don't know if MO will be OK w/the oils themselves, I ordered Perio White toothpaste and Perio mouthwash which both have clove and oregano as well as other oils to cover the Thrush issue (I've never had any results from Biotene so I don't want to rely on that).  Also decided to change to a natural deodorant so ordered Arm & Hammer Essential Natural deodorant - I want to stop using those products that contain Aluminum (who knows what those have done to all of us all these years?).  Other items listed in the Chemo Shopping list I already have on hand so I believe I'm covered.  Oh, also purchased a Ninja Crush/Blend/Chop today so I can make protein drinks and smoothies - I am really nervous about losing weight if my appetite drops so I'm doing what I can to have things on hand w/high calories and high protein - I hope it works as I've gotten so thin I don't want to lose even one more pound! So, I think I'm as prepared as I can be.....should have the EKG results already but my family doctor and clinic PAC are both out for the week and I don't know if the doctor who is working in their replacement will release those results to me via electronic chart (like my doctor always does as soon as they review the results I have it w/in minutes of their review).  I may have to wait until MO visit on Thurs to find out - same w/PET scan.  That's ok - what's one day with all the waiting we've done so far. I'm still nervous, anxious and worried - but I sound like I fall in w/a very large group of people who felt the same way before the first chemo.  Hoping for the best; that's all I can do. Thank you all for your words of encouragement - I'll update you as soon as I can.  I have several appointments on Friday but should be able to get a post together letting you know \"it was all fine - I worried myself for no reason at all\" - I'm trying to keep positive that that is what I will have to report. Take care all!  Again, my prayers and thoughts are with you all!",

I\u2019ve been reading that many women find they eat anything and everything because of the steroids \u2013 did you have any effect like that?  I\u2019m HOPING I do\u2026.I want so bad to gain some of my lost weight.  I told my MO the last visit I\u2019m probably one of the only women who looks forward to weight gain.  Even if I just put on 15 pounds, I\u2019d be happy \u2013 like you I just don\u2019t want to lose any!  Pam \u2013 there\u2019s also a good site; www.scarfand.com that had really nice scarves at very reasonable prices; I paid less than $10 for each scarf and got free shipping.  I purchased a few from them and also found some nice, inexpensive ones at Amazon.  Please make sure you keep in mind that the size does NOT matter.  You can YouTube scarf tying and get all sorts of hints on how to tie difference size scarves in different ways \u2013 VERY USEFUL to watch videos.  Also bought caps for less than $4 at Amazon and 5 hats (all under $10).  I think I\u2019ll be wearing the hats more than everything else\u2026.but who knows?  I might love the wig so much that I may wear that the most \u2013 we\u2019ll just have to see.  I\u2019m happy for you to have received word that your job is safe!  That\u2019s great news!  Poodle-mum \u2013 so glad you got your issues \u201cresolved\u201d w/your BS.  See, we all told you not to worry about \u201cbothering\u201d him; that\u2019s what he\u2019s there for!  It still sounds very difficult to me, but I\u2019m a wus.  It\u2019s good you\u2019ve had enough medical issues in the past to make this easier for you \u2013 too bad you\u2019ve had those issues but it seemed to have prepared you for the issues you are now facing.  Aviva \u2013 glad you have a sleep schedule and are able to rest!  Doesn\u2019t it feel great to sleep!  Wrenn \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of you!  I hope we hear from you soon and the news is that you are well on your way to a full recovery!  I know my EKG results were done yesterday; the technician told me it would be read by the cardiologist and electronically sent immediately to my PCP.  Well, since my clinics Dr and PAC are both out of town for a seminar, apparently the \u201cfill-in\u201d Dr didn\u2019t see a need to forward the results to me.  GRRRRR!  Well, I guess I\u2019ll find out that and the PET Scan results soon enough; appt w/MO tomorrow morning at 8:50 to be immediately followed by chemo.  So, I guess I\u2019ll have an informative day.  Still nervous but now I\u2019m more of the frame of mind of \u201clet\u2019s get this going and get the first-time over and done with\u201d.  I got a good quote from a lovely lady at another thread;   Don't wait for the storm to pass rather learn to dance in the rain.  Good thought and I\u2019ll focus on that afterwards\u2026instead of worrying about what, if any, SE\u2019s are going to hit\u2026I\u2019ll focus on \u201cdancing\u201d along with whatever comes.  I\u2019ve told my employer I prefer to not come in on Friday \u2013 not knowing how I will feel and if I\u2019m sick to my stomach (and so toxic from the Adriamycin) it\u2019s best I not be sharing a bathroom with other employees and the public.  I\u2019ve no interest in sanitizing a public toilet afterward if I do throw up!  So he agreed it was best I take the first couple treatments and stay home the Friday following just to be safe for everyone.  If I find I\u2019m not dealing w/feeling sick to my stomach or if it is well controlled w/medications, then I can resume my Friday work schedule.  That\u2019s it from here.  I\u2019ll post again tomorrow if I\u2019m up for it \u2013 if not tomorrow I\u2019ll let you all know just as soon as I can.  As always, my thoughts and prayers are with each of you!  Have a good night!",

Since I\u2019ll be there and be put under, I\u2019ll likely just have them put in a darn port right away and be done with it (if chemo doesn\u2019t agree w/my veins, I don\u2019t want to go in for ANOTHER surgery!).  MO is fine w/delaying chemo another week until we can get all the info possible from surgery and Cardiology.  She assured me it would not put me in any danger of relapse \u2013 not to worry about going beyond the 8 week period.  Better to have all the info before chemo starts.  My mastectomy specimens were examined for hormone testing and it is verified that I am Triple Negative \u2013 all mastectomy tissues came back exactly the same as the miniscule biopsy tissues.  So we are certain what we\u2019re dealing with there.  My blood work I had done prior to when chemo was to start 9/26 is showing I am \u201cmildly\u201d anemic (no surprise there).  She will watch that closely as we get chemotherapy started.  All other functions looked well (finally some good news!).  So, looks like I\u2019m back in for surgery \u2013 I don\u2019t know when.  But I am on the schedule to begin chemo 10/10 barring any delays w/surgery scheduling.  Chatted w/my family doc and she is not of the same mind as me regarding not using Adriamycin.  She said I need to make sure I listen carefully to what Cardiology can do to protect my heart and then I need to think long and hard about following the recommendations of MO \u2013 she seems much more concerned w/my cancer than my heart (makes me wonder if there is something I don\u2019t know here????).  So, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m on the fence again as to what therapy\u2026.AC/T or TC.  I\u2019ll see what Cardiologist says tomorrow.  Then listen to what MO says after she gets recommendation from Cardiology.  This is all so much to take in; I find myself having a little pity party too often and keep having an annoying and unrealistic thought go thru my head again and again \u2013 \u201cI want my old life back\u201d \u2013 even though I know that is impossible.  So, I\u2019m conflicted once again.  Thought my decision was sound but now I\u2019m worried how my family doctor was really concerned I\u2019m making a poor decision.  I\u2019ll keep an open mind and listen to what is put in front of me this next week and decide as best I can from that.  I\u2019m really nervous if all docs tell me Adriamycin is the drug to use\u2026after everything I read it scares me.  Yet I know I have an aggressive cancer and it is widely used for TNBC so perhaps I should stop putting my 2cents worth in and let the specialists do what they do best \u2013 easier said than done, though (and you all know my trust issues w/docs so I don\u2019t think I need to explain further).  Well, one day at a time.  Let\u2019s get this surgery done and over with and move on from there. Oh, and just to top everything off my husband was furloughed today because of Govn Shut-down\u2026.indefinitely.  Great, like our finances haven\u2019t taken a hard enough hit so far - now this!  Wrenn \u2013 notice we have something else in common again?  Our start dates are now the same.  I seem to have gotten to know you thru our posts and almost feel like we could be sisters in our thoughts and experiences\u2026.wish we could go to chemo together and hold each others hands (that really makes me sound like a baby, I know, but it\u2019s how I feel). I am so happy you are continuing to mend.  You deserve to feel well again; I swear you\u2019ve been thru more than your fair share of issues from surgery!  What does your MO say about further delaying chemo given your TN status?   Oh, and I hear you on this forum being better than books about anxiety!  Remember, Search and Destroy, Wrenn \u2013 that\u2019s the motto!  Princessajf \u2013 I also returned to work ½ days for 2 weeks before returning to full time.  It was just as Aviva said \u2013 exhausting those first 2 weeks back (amazing what the surgery takes out of you!).  Don\u2019t over-do it.  Listen to your body and when it tells you its tired, then it\u2019s time to go home and rest.  Take advantage of your employers offer to let you set your schedule; I think you\u2019ll be happy in the long run to ease back into work slowly.  KBeee \u2013 did they figure out what\u2019s going on w/your urine?  Is it a SE or is something else going on w/the bladder?  I didn\u2019t see that you had an answer from that yet\u2026\u2026 (maybe I missed it).  And the abdominal pain and raw throat?  It\u2019s not necessarily that I think of TC as \u201cdying from cancer\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting from my docs \u2013 which worries me.  It may have to be what we use if they can\u2019t protect my heart (and I have no heart disease but I don\u2019t want it either \u2013 not w/my family history) but it certainly is not their first choice \u2013 again, which worries me.  I\u2019ll have flippin grey hair (when it comes back) just from all the damn worrying I\u2019ve been thru!!!!!  Forget chemo doing it \u2013 the stress of all this will be the cause, I\u2019m sure!  Poodle-mum \u2013 Great job on the fund raising!  You go, girl!!!!  Yes \u2013 we have good nights and bad.  Hope you are resting better now!  Jenn \u2013 so sorry you have to endure chemo again.  That\u2019s not the news we wanted to hear.  But I swear, you have an incredibly positive attitude!  And I\u2019m glad you are healing well, too!  That\u2019s just terrible news that you have to shop for new clothes \u2013 not!  So see there, something positive \u2013 have a blast shopping!  Honeybair \u2013 how are you sleeping?  I do hope better; I too had such a long, hard road w/sleeping and the mastectomy just makes it so difficult.  I wish so bad for you to be able to get back to bed and get a restful nights sleep.  I keep thinking about you and wishing you the best!  I\u2019ve chewed up enough space here.  Hope everyone has a wonderful evening and all are enjoying this nice mild autumn weather that seems to have settled upon us. ",

If there are simple exercises I can do that I can find online I'd rather do that. I've been to the lymphedema threads in the past....I'd rather hear from you gals. Anyone w/a Power Port. Just and FYI - I was told to always carry that card we all get when we have port implanted and to make sure all medical personnel are told I have a port. Since I know I'll forget....they also had a wristband in my packet that says \" Bard Power Port\" as a reminder to me to remind medical folks I have one, so I wear that. OK - the ER folks really liked that and nobody had ever seen a patient before me have one. They said they wished everyone would wear the wristband if they received it because it tells them all the need to know (basically the type of port is all they need to be informed of). They also said most patients they get who have a port have no clue what kind so if they wore the wristband, the medical folks would know all they needed just by looking at it (not to mention if patient is in some shape where they cannot talk - the wristband would be a HUGE help to them). So just wanted to pass that on. Granted, it is an ugly wristband but if it makes things safer and faster for the medical profession when they need to know....then I'm wearing it!",

I second you, Wrenn, eesh! I did feel like a fool at ER but I also realize the potential emergency of the circumstance. But when one looks at their ER discharge papers and sees \"Swollen Arm\" as reason for visit....makes me feel like some hypochondriac running to ER. Oh well, it's always something! You know, I thought once the breasts were removed I''d simply move on to neo-adjuctant therapy - amazing all the crap that can pop up after the initial surgery! None of it really matters - we couldn't have made any other decision if we wanted the cancer out of our bodies (which we all did) so whatever problems that come up afterwards; well, just something we have to deal with. I'll not look back and say \"well if I didn't have a BMX this or that never would have happened\" - there was no option. So just little obstacles being thrown in my path - I'll overcome them and march on and in time...this will all be behind me! Now, you ladies who have been to PT, I'd like to hear your experiences. I know to ask to see a CERTIFIED lymphedema specialist PT - that is made very clear at BCO and at the lymphedema threads. I really don't want to see anyone....the time it takes to get to Madison and then appointment times and the time to get back from Madison; looking at an easy 3 hours out of my day that would require missing work (I doubt these specialists work in the evening!!). I'd like to hear from anyone seeing their PT's on this so I have an idea what your experiences are.",

Your doc is probably saying \u201chealed and healthy\u201d because your poor body has been thru so much.  Another surgery is only going to make things worse\u2026so he wants you in the best possible shape before that happens so your healing time will be optimal.  I know it\u2019s hard, but it is important that we allow our bodies to heal before causing more stress to it.  And remember, you vent here anytime you want!  We are hear to listen and help each other get thru these tough times so use us when you need to, OK? Funny how we know so little about what goes on around us sometimes isn\u2019t it?  You found a bus that has been there the whole time and you never knew it!  That\u2019s funny! Ndgrrl \u2013 I am so sorry for the confusion that has entered your life.  It\u2019s unacceptable, in my opinion.  I agree with you that they should have biopsied the cyst right away during surgery since it was right there in front of there faces!  It\u2019s not like you could speak for yourself at that moment but is would seem to me every women would want a biopsy done on anything they found suspicious during surgery so they should have done it.  Where was their common sense?  Jeez! KBeee \u2013 I\u2019ll ask my MO today about the Epicor.  Amazing results you talked about but I\u2019m thinking she might say \u201cno\u201d.  She seems to be concerned about my taking too much antioxidant.  I don\u2019t take any supplement as an anti-oxidant \u2013 I take Vitamin D, daily vitamin, B12, Blood Builder (for anemia), Azo yeast (to prevent any yeast infection during chemo), Azo Urinary Tract Health (to prevent UTI during chemo) and Fish Oil (as directed by Complimentary Care for high cholesterol.  Nothing there that is an anti-oxidant so I don\u2019t know where her concern comes from she mentioned during one appt that she doesn\u2019t want me taking too much as it will interfere w/my chemo.  But I\u2019ll ask \u2013 I\u2019m all for taking a simple pill if it can keep me healthy (I think I already take too much but several are just being taken for health during chemo and once that\u2019s done I won\u2019t take them any more). What brand is it that is made in your city? 2 out of 6 done \u2013 that has to feel great!  I hear you on the in-law visit\u2026..I don\u2019t get people sometimes.  They might think they are doing the right thing but don\u2019t think things thru very well.  Oh well, sometime we have to put our feelings aside to keep the in-laws happy\u2026..I hope you have an enjoyable weekend.  Remember, nothing wrong with excusing yourself from their company if you\u2019re not up to visiting, though. It is YOUR difficult time fighting this disease and it\u2019s all about you right now.  If they get miffed, they\u2019ll get over it.  Wrenn \u2013 you have to be able to bounce back!  It\u2019s easy for some of us to get discouraged because of our pasts, but the one thing I\u2019ve learned is staying discouraged just makes things worse.  You have to look at things for what they are and crawl back out of that hole we put ourselves in to face what needs to be faced.  I\u2019m better at it now than I\u2019ve ever been.  I just want to get things moving and today seems to be the day.  The waiting was annoying at times, the set-backs were frustrating, but in the end I still face the fact that cancer could be lingering in my body and I want it out.  It is that which keeps me going and keeps me focused (I\u2019ve not dealt so well w/the headaches over the years but that\u2019s because there is no end in site for that; the doctors don\u2019t know how to help\u2026.so it\u2019s no wonder I end up in that terrible hole and find it difficult to crawl out.).  Have you considered trying Blood Builder for your anemia?  I can\u2019t say it will work for you but it does wonders for me.  Always brings my numbers back up and gets me out of the anemia range w/in 6 weeks, always!  You can find it at health food stores or online.  It might help\u2026.. I\u2019m glad your \u201cshrink\u201d has you taking anxiety meds.  Remember, all is not lost on the chemo front, Wrenn.  I know you need to think of the possibility that it may not happen but don\u2019t discount it yet.  Let the doctor\u2019s guide you\u2026\u2026don\u2019t jump to conclusions.  You are not the first person who has had a long, drawn out recovery who needs chemo so they have protocols in place for these situations.  It\u2019s important to not put yourself in the frame of mind of \u201cthey won\u2019t even let me do chemo because it\u2019s too late\u201d\u2026.you don\u2019t know that (do you?) \u2013 at least I\u2019ve not read that any doctor has told you that.  Just relax, let the anti-anxiety meds do their thing, and just let your body heal.  Again, the doctors will guide you on if chemo is an option or not.  And until your MO tells you it is no longer an option, you\u2019re just playing a guessing game with yourself and that\u2019s not healthy.  Do you get what I\u2019m saying?  I worry for you because I keep reading words that sound to me like you\u2019re giving up on having chemo and I don\u2019t want you going there when your MO hasn\u2019t told you that\u2026\u2026 Jo \u2013 I hope you get your answers today.  I can\u2019t imagine having to change PCP\u2019s right now \u2013 its simply unthinkable!  I feel for any of you who have to do this right now \u2013 it must be very daunting having to go thru your entire health history to someone new.  Hoping you hear \u201cyou do not need chemo\u201d \u2013 that would be so nice, don\u2019t you agree? This darn cold or whatever is still plaguing me but I don\u2019t think it will delay chemo.  The post nasal drip ended up in my chest and I just can\u2019t get a productive cough going.  I\u2019ve tried what I thought would help, added vitamin C, took an OTC expectorant, but nothing seems to help.  But perhaps the MO will have something she can suggest.  I just can\u2019t believe that during \u201ccold and flu\u201d season they would hold up my chemo over this\u2026.. I\u2019m not nervous at all about today, which is quite unlike me.  But I\u2019ve been like that since before 9/26 when chemo was supposed to start. Can\u2019t find a damn scone anywhere at the UW.  It\u2019s almost like I wrote about it back in September and since then NO SCONES anytime we are there.  Damn!!!!!  And I mean none!  We\u2019ve stopped by at least once a week during all times of the day and nothing.  Guess I\u2019m going to have to settle for Perkins Muffins or something \u2013 will send my husband out once chemo gets started.  Oh well, Perkins makes a darn good Blueberry Muffin so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a total loss but I have to say, I really wanted the scones to be my treat for chemo\u2026\u2026 Hoping everyone is well.  Sorry I\u2019ve not written but this Lyrica they have me on makes me fall asleep at the drop of the hat and I literally fall asleep trying to write posts that are more than a couple sentences.  I have such a hard time getting used to these anti-convulsants but I need to keep on it for the pains in my arms.  As always, each one of you is in my thoughts and prayers!  Have a great day!

So happy you got the Blood Builder!  I have to tell you, my MO looked at my blood tests they did just prior to my appt w/her and she said \u201cyou must be doing something right because you are just .2 points shy of your hemoglobin being back in the normal range\u201d.  I reminded her about the Blood Builder and she was very impressed by it.  Remember, it was just 3 weeks ago I was told I was anemic \u2013 began taking Blood Builder and look how far it\u2019s gotten me in such a short period of time.  I love that stuff!!!!! Well, we finally did chemo today!  Had a little anxiety start as we were waiting (they were about an hour behind) but that was because I had a really bad headache and was fearing chemo might do something to aggrevate it.  And the blood draw was a little, OK, much more uncomfortable than I anticipated!  That HURT when then accessed the port!  Damn, nobody prepared me for that and it was most unexpected (found out later it\u2019s because it\u2019s a large needle being used).  I will definitely be using lidocaine crème in the future to get it numbed up about an your before going in. I felt as good leaving chemo as I did going in.  No problems as all.  Port worked very well, had no bad effects from the pre-meds, sucked on ice chips during Adriamycin infusion, and they ran the Cytoxin over 60 minutes just to make sure I had no allergic reaction.  Was a very long day (from 11:15am to 5:30pm) and I\u2019m beat.  But no SE\u2019s at all; that can all change by tomorrow but I\u2019m not going to worry about it.  If something comes up, I either have been given meds to handle it or I call and get advise on what to do or what to take.  It really was no big deal\u2026.but I\u2019m sure fatigue is going to be an issue (given how many problems I\u2019m having w/fatigue and the Lyrica already) and I do worry a bit about bone pain after Neulasta injection tomorrow (because I take Loratadine every day for allergies (that is the generic of Claritan) so I fear it will not be as helpful to me as it is to others because my body is so used to it already).  I\u2019ll just have to wait and see; and I have the weekend to recoup should I need it. Falling asleep here, I\u2019ll post more tomorrow. ",

I finally called and left a message about feeling so sick to my stomach and the compazine was not working and both my legs were swollen (hadn't heard of that side effect so pretty worried about what that was all about). Well, I had to leave the house at 3:00 to get to clinic for my Neulasta injection and still had not heard from cancer center. Got home at 5:15 and sure enough, 15 minutes after I had left they called and left a message on our answering machine - just saying to call the clinic (not addressing my problems and I signed all the paperwork allowing all clinics and doctors to leave detailed messages on our home answering machine and to my husband directly). They close at 5:00 - so I got no answer yesterday and felt like it was unnecessary to bother a Oncologist on Call with my problems. I had the nurse at my PCP clinic look at my swollen legs (oh, I should let you all know I weighted myself before leaving and was at a wopping 124 pounds - there is no way I gained 5 pounds eating 2 muffins in the last 24 hours so I was convinced it was some sort of water retention issue). The nurse agreed when she looked at them and I told her the weight gain issue - advised I watch my sodium intake. Hell, I'm not watching anything - ate another muffin and some chicken nuggets - I'm just eating what I feel I can stomach and what is easy for my husband to prepare. Well, having only gotten 2 hours of sleep the first night, I was in bed by 8 last night. Up at 2:30 this morning - terrible back ache. I have 4 pinched nerves in my lumbar spine so this backache is not unheard of but definitely worse than normal - could be the Neulasta to blame. So I got out of bed, took my morning meds and within 2 hours I want to throw up. This anti-nausua med just is not cutting it so I will contact the Oncologist on Call in a few hours and ask for something diff. I won't eat if there is any chance I might throw up - just won't do it (you all know what I mean...might be ok going down but.....). I do have body aches all over - again - probably the Neulasta but it's not so bad that I need to be in bed nor is it as bad like when you have the flu.  Headaches are wicked bad....could be part of why I feel so sick to my stomach; who knows. Sounds like colds are going around, and some w/fevers. It is cold & flu season and there is a lot of viruses going around. I was taking an expectorant before chemo but MO said to me \"your chest and lungs are clear so chemo will go ahead. It seems the problem is everything is stuck in the throat and since we can't cough it out, lets try drying it up\". So we moved to Sudafed and it seems to be helping. That low grade fever I had was short lived. I've had no fever for the past 5 days so I was not too concerned w/the cold. But any of you out there who are running a fever, even if only low grade, check w/your MO or PCP to make sure you don't take something they don't want you taking. OTC meds can be very dangerous when mixed w/prescription drugs....please always check before mixing the 2. Poodle-mum - your feeling cold I think is a reaction to the surgeries we've been subjected to. I, too, am sensitive to both cold and heat. I believe there is medical evidence of it (I may have read that somewhere along the way) but I couldn't tell you what it is. But you summed it up...our immune systems have been/are affected. And let's face it...we went from very hot weather to very cool weather very quickly this year. We didn't get a nice gradual easing into the current temps - it's been a strange year for weather. How is your weight holding up?  You seem to eat so little - and I wonder if you were able to get more in you that your healing might speed up.  I did a little reading on how best to handle my extreme weight loss (which I'm really beginning to think was all related to the cancer growing inside me - nothing else made sense, doctors couldn't explain it away w/all the tests they were running, true-I eat less when I have my headache flares but that's been going on for 10 years so the weight loss in last 1-2 years really couldn't be explained).  Anyway....after reading and talking w/both my husband and daughter, who are both much more knowelegable about nutrition than myself, we all decided the best way to at least keep on what weight I had was w/protein bars.  So I stocked up on several different types (I've tried at least a dozen and picked out about 4 of the favorites and stocked up on them).  I've been eating them now since late Sept when chemo was supposed to start and instead of running to the vending machine at work when I get hungry, I reach in my purse for a protein bar.  It's obviously much more nutritious and I've gone from 106 lbs up to 116 at weigh in before chemo.  So 10 lbs is considerable considering nothing else had worked.  Just somethin you might want to look into.  It's good for you, several of the ones I eat are actually \"meal replacement\" bars so they are meant to \"stick to your bones\".  I'm not expert in any way about nutrition, but I can tell you it has worked for me.  FYI - I don't believe Cheetos count, lol! Please do not think we believe anything of the sort about being selfish!  Poodle-mum, we all have different circumstances that brought us here, some of our diagnoses are worse than others, some are better, some had easier recoveries, some had drains forever, some had inexcusable medical care following their surgeries, and on and on.  Point is we are all different.  Any of us who may have, what you say, a harder time, are HAPPY for you.  I can't speak to how I would feel if I had a friend with the circumstances you spoke of and walked away with a small scar and very short recovery and treatement.  I can tell you this though...I might very well be jealous, just like you.  It's hard; we have been.....for lack of a more tactful term....mutilated by the surgeries we had to have.  And the recovery was often times hard and for some of us, long.  You and Wrenn I believe have had it worse than any of us and I don't blame you for feeling \"bitter\".  I think that's a normal reaction.  But you need to recognize it so you know where it comes from and don't allow it to affect your perspective on life.  We all got sick, we all had our surgeries which dramatically altered our physical appearances, we all suffered through our recoveries and have all had to turn down different paths in our treatments.  Nobody got off easy here, nobody!  Remember that - I don't think any of us think for a second that you got \"lucky\".  Quite contrary - again, you and Wrenn have suffered greatly with your recoveries and are far, far, from lucky!!!  I guess what I would wonder is this...that friend you spoke of who is back to her normal life....how does she speak of her illness and recovery?  How does she relate to you and what you are going thru?  How did her perspective on life and the disease of cancer in any form befalling anyone change her?  Do you see where I'm going?  I don't know this person, I'll not judge her so don't take what I wrote as that (I'm just letting my words flow but want to make sure they are not read in a way other than what I intend them to be).  But I wonder if she really understands what you have been thru, how your entire life has changed, how you must deal with the physical changes in your appearance, how nothing seems like it will be the same as it had been.  See, I think if she understood, you'd be picking up different signals from her and you would't be feeling jealous.  Just my opinion, again I don't know her and I'm NOT judging her; but it might explain why you feel the way you do.  And it's nothing to feel guilty about.  We go thru life picking up signals from others every day and formulating opinions of them or their ciurcumstances....we all do it.  But never really give it much thought unless it leads us to feeling those emotions we don't like feeling and then we start to perhaps overanylis (which I have probably done here so I'll just stop and leave it at that and some food for thought). Jeannine - Wow, time flies!  Half way thru w/rads.....seems like you just started.  Of course, I'm not the one receiving it so that's all easy for me to say!  I don't mean it that way; I know it's no easy task.  You must be feeling good knowing you are so close to finishing (half done and now on the downslide); best to try to look at everything positively.  I'm very happy for you! Wrenn - you know, I purposely didn't use any lidocaine creme because I had no idea if I would feel discomfort like others or be one of the ladies who didn't think it was much of a big deal.  Had I known the needle is \"more like a nail going in\" - that's what the nurse at my PCP said - it's a big needle! I certainly would have slathered up on anything to freeze the area first.  Ah well, as always....live and learn. I do hope you follow thru on your letters regarding your original surgeon.  The care you received is totally unacceptabe, and have had long lasting effects on further treatment.  Not to mention the emotional issues that come along with all that!  What sort of reprecusions are there for that sort of care in Canada w/Universal Health Care?  What avenues do you have to direct your comlaints?  I'd want to make sure that surgeon were never allowed again to treat a patient as you were treated and to do whatever I could to make sure that happened.  Can't change what was done to you (but I hope you have avenues to be made \"whole\" again) but hopefully you can bring about change so nobody gets treated in such an abhorent manner in the future. Don't get too nervous about the fever...but I'd call your MO and let them know.  It could just be from your cold but let the MO make the decision if they should look at you now to make sure there is not an infection from other sources causing the fever.  Wrenn, don't be afraid of the MO approving chemo.  You can do chemo, you can!  If it reduces your recurrance rates, you have to wrap your head around that you can do it!  Remember, just because you read about the plethora of side effects talked about in the threads here does NOT mean they will happen to you.  Most probably won't, or if they do, they might not be such a bother to you.  You need to keep it in perspective - and there is truth to these types of forums often \"concentrating\" on the \"bad side of things\" - but that's a good thing!  Then we all know what COULD be ahead of us, but remember that word....COULD.  I truly believe this forum is a blessing but you need to take some things with a grain of salt, Wrenn.  Don't focus on the bad, focus on the Search and Destroy and manage the SE's if/when they happen.  I'm not so sure I agree with your surgeons thinking on it being too late beyond 3 months.  We are both triple negative; and I had something lighting up on my PET Scan which I had surgery for 2+ months following BMX.  But even had I not had that surgery, I was told the chemo would kill the tumor if it was cancerous and we would remove it after chemotherapy.  So, that's a KNOWN concern of possible mets....and I'm not certain what made them decide to get it out prior to chemo, but I'm glad they did.  Yes, our cancers are more aggressive but that doesn't mean they can't be killed off, and they are w/chemo.  If there is too much concern in your case, might you ask for a PET Scan at your 3 month post op mark?  Then I think you and your MO will have a better picture to make an informed decision - what do you think of that?  I don't believe your MO could say that is an unreasonable request..... Babs - that is such wonderful news about your daughter moving back to NY.  I am so happy for you as in your postings it is clear how happy it makes you to have her close by.  I know how you feel...I'd love my \"little girl\" closer to home but I knew once she saw the other side of the Rockies she'd be lost to us to that part of the country.  But it's where she belongs, it brings her happiness and is truly her passion so we are, of course, very happy for her.  Just wish it wasn't so far away...But so happy you have your's back from across the pond. And that is great news about your 3 month check up!! ndgrrl - you know what...????  I couln't have asked to read a more hilarious and truthful post as what you posted at a time I am feeling so poorly.  Yes, I was giggling thru it because you painted a very clear and precise picture and I think we all could relate to certain aspects of your experience.  You are a HOOT!!!!  What's with them putting you in stirrups and making you wait like that?  I've never been asked to be like that and would never have thought of anyone being told to be like that waiting for a doctor.  Really!  I'm always seated on the table when the doc comes in (in the future, don't let any nurse tell you that you have to be laying down and in the stirrups waiting for a doc - for goodness sakes - no wonder you have such an aversion to Paps!) and when the doc is ready, then I lay down and let them direct my back side where they need it and only then do I put my feet in the stirrups.  Not one second before the doc is ready am I going to be put in such a vulerable position - feeling that breeze on the Hoo Haa!  You're a brave lady looking at all those instruments - I avoid looking anywhere even close to that tray.  I don't want to know!  I know what they are, I know what they look like and know what they're used for but I don't want to see them right before they are going to be used, on ME!  No way!  I'd pick my toenails before looking at those things!  Not that I have (I know, it's the grossest thing I could think of but I'm not a toenail picker!)but you all get the point.  Hell, I've even counted the little holes on the ceiling panels waiting, anything but looking at that tray.  I know the experience was terrible for you but you turned it into a very funny story so please know I feel for your undue anxiety, I really do. Thank you, dear, for the wonderfully hilarious and truthful story that we can all relate to.  It could not have come to me at a better time.  And I'll never put on another gown without thinking of Shamoo!!!! KBeee - hope you did well at the Run for the Cure (I'm assuming you will not read this until after the run).  I hope your legs do not hurt too much; your a very strong wippersnapper, you are, to still be determined to run the whole 3.1 miles w/legs feeling like cement.  I swear, I wish I had one iotta of your determination and strength!  When you are able to catch up with the posts here, please let me know the brand of Epicor you take....I'm really interested to try it. OK - as always, I've chewed up enough space here.  Hoping everyone has a wonder autumn weekend and is feeling healthy and happy and determined to move forward in the routes we have been directed.  My thoughts and prayers are with each of you!",

I have not felt sick to my stomach since waking up and having a bite to eat.  Keeping my fingers crossed that holds and I can get back to work tomorrow. I have a questions, though, to those who have been thru chemo:  It was explained the \"white ick\" and thrush come after approx. 5 days when the lining of the mucus membranes begin to slough off due to the deadening from chemo drugs.  I have, from day one, begun the salt water rinse I was told would help and have been quite religious with it since I don't want any \"white ick\" - or thrush!  So...for how long do you generally do this rinse?  I mean, can I stop like at day 7 or 8 or before?  Or is this something you do throughout chemo to keep those problems at bay?",

I went to work on Wed and literally sat there for 4 hours in the morning trying to figure out how to do my job.  It\u2019s like my memory had been partially erased; that\u2019s really the only way I can explain it.  When my co-worker went to lunch, I completely lost it and just started balling my head off.  I was so frustrated I couldn\u2019t remember such simple day-to-day things and it has me very scared for what the future holds w/the rest of my treatments.  My MO and I briefly discussed what I had read about \u201cchemo brain\u201d but it was my understanding it was like a \u201clittle forgetful\u201d \u2013 I felt completely and totally blindsided by what was happened, completely unprepared, just very, very scary. I went to see a Lymphedema specialist yesterday but after sitting in the waiting room for 40 minutes I got annoyed and we left.  Got home and hopped online and saw I went to the wrong clinic \u2013 shows you how bad my head is functioning.  My lack of being able to function did not escape my employer; they have encouraged me to stay home and just try to rest as best I can (we are hoping it is just complete and utter fatigue and not some really bad SE of chemo).  They said, after I sent them an email on Thurs explaining how I felt like such an idiot at work and felt guilty for getting paid to be stupid, that they noticed how I was having such a difficult time trying to do anything on Wednesday.  I took 2 sleeping pills last night but was up again after 3 hours.  So it\u2019s been a bad week. Been in contact w/my PCP and MO nurse today \u2013 we are going to try different sleeping meds tonight in hopes of getting some sleep beyond 2-3 hours.  If it does not work, they gave me additional options to try tomorrow night.  I did have to take steroids for 2 extra days on Monday and Tues per MO directions to assist w/the horrible bone/joint pain so I could understand not sleeping well those nights (I did take Benadryl Tues night but it did nothing).  This type of insomnia is, again, nothing I had read about or was prepared for\u2026some problems sleeping because of steroids, yes.  But still not being able to sleep beyond 3 hours a night WITH sleeping medications over a week after chemo \u2013 I never read anything like that.  Gotta ask any of you ladies who are/have done chemo \u2013 is there a polite way to tell people to PLEASE STOP ASKING IF I\u2019M PUSHING THE FLUIDS?  Geez, am I tired of being asked and don\u2019t know how to tell people to please stop asking every day! Poodle-Mum \u2013 I am so happy you have your new-found eating abilities!!!  I know it felt so good to me when I put on 10 pounds in a month (I use Protein Bars\u2026.they work very well and my husband and daughter had gotten all sorts for me to try and I picked out a few I really liked and they certainly helped put on the weight!) so I can really appreciate your happiness in being able to eat and actually enjoying it!  Oh, and on the Protein Bar issue\u2026I also make sure I\u2019m eating those that are not only high in Protein, but high in calories.  Gotta do what I can to get my weight back up.  You might want to look into them so if you\u2019re not up to eating (or even preparing) a meal, it\u2019s easy to grab one or two and fill your tummy up. Your healing seems to be coming along \u2013 slowly but surely.  It all takes time and you had so many problems it makes sense to me it would require a longer healing time. One day at a time, right, Poodle-mum?  One day at a time\u2026.. VintageGal \u2013 I know what you are saying\u2026.I don\u2019t know what is chemo related and what is Nuelasta related (except the bone/joint pain \u2013 I\u2019m confident that was the Neulasta).  Have your flu like symptoms gotten better after further treatments or was this just the beginning for me?  And how long have you been kept down after each treatment?  I just feel that being over a week past chemo I should be feeling so much better than I am\u2026.. Also, if you or anyone else can explain what the mouth sores are I\u2019d appreciate it.  I have some sore like feelings along the sides of my mouth back by the molars but since I\u2019ve been stressed and have been known to grind my teeth when sleep when stressed, I don\u2019t know if it is that or if it is the mouth sores I read about.  They don\u2019t hurt which makes me wonder if I\u2019ve just been grinding my teeth and the skin on the sides of my mouth getting caught in the grinding.  Everyone seems to speak of mouth sores as painful and mine are definitely NOT painful. KBeee \u2013 that would be great if you could just do 4 treatments!  I hope your oncotype score comes back such that only 4 are needed (and then we can all do a happy dance for you!).  That would mean 1 more treatment \u2013 gosh, would that be nice!!!! You mentioned previously that your legs feeling like cement (after the Run) may have had something to do with your hemoglobin, is that right?  Have you thought to perhaps try Blood Builder to bring your hemoglobin back up and perhaps get some relief from your \u201ccement\u201d legs?  I\u2019m really happy it brought my numbers up so quickly this past month so I could begin chemo just being right below the normal limits; usually have not gotten such quick results but sure am happy I did.  Just throwing it out there \u2013 I love Blood Builder and wonder why more doctors don\u2019t know about it to recommend it to their patients!  Word needs to get out about that stuff \u2013 too many of us cannot take those gross black pills that are iron supplements (yuck!) w/o putting so much pain in our stomach\u2026.. Wrenn \u2013 see, nothing to worry about in the whole TN timetable debate.  You can get chemo beyond 12 weeks and it can be very effective.  Remember, none of us have any guarantee chemo will work for us; doesn\u2019t matter if someone starts 2 weeks post-op or 15 weeks post-op\u2026sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work.  So glad you got that issue resolved!  I think if your wound is NOT closed by that that time, it is probably healed mostly on the inside where it is most important (and KBeee could prob talk about that better \u2013 I\u2019m far from any EMT or medical professional but I do believe it is normal for wounds to heal from the inside out). But can you tell us why you opted to not just try to start chemo now?  If he said you could, and given your past concerns about getting it started, I guess I would have thought you might opt to start asap. Let me know what metaplastic carcinoma is \u2013 you said you\u2019ll be researching it more\u2026I know nothing about it but am interested in learning and knowing how it affects you personally and your treatments. There\u2019s a lot of crud going around, virus-wise.  Did you talk to MO about that?  I thought I had a bad cold but when I saw MO before chemo, I found out my chest and lungs were clear (and I had been trying for a week w/an expectorant to clear out what wasn\u2019t even there) and the problem was just so much post-nasal drip from allergies.  Easy solution \u2013 Sudafed to dry it up.  Your cold might be something like that.  Also, might you add a Probiotic to your daily supplements (w/your MO approval first).  My MO actually asked me to start taking them (she told me to make sure I get the refrigerated ones because when they are not refrigerated, the stuff starts dying and then is not effective) since I know entering cold and flu season is going to be very difficult for me where I work (co-workers all around are not the best at keeping their germs to themselves\u2026not to mention the public interaction!).  She said when she started having her young child take a Probiotic (he\u2019s in daycare and was always getting sick) he\u2019s been much more healthy and is hardly ever picking up viruses anymore.  It\u2019s an easy thing to add and I\u2019m taking one every day.  I even told my daughter about it and pleaded with her to pick some up.  She\u2019s one of those who refuses to get a flu shot and had suffered w/pneumonia 2 winters ago\u2026.I can\u2019t MAKE her understand the importance of a flu shot but she was open to taking the Probiotic and has begun taking it daily.  Just something you might want to think about. I agree w/KBeee as well as far as doctors are concerned.  Regarding Claritin\u2026.Wrenn, ask him if he has any problems with you taking it.  It is, in general, a very safe allergy med that is sold OTC.  If he has no problem with it and you want to try it based on all you\u2019ve read and heard, then by all means try it!  Your MO sounds like a reasonable man and doesn\u2019t sound like he thinks himself so high and mighty that he would be offended w/you using Claritin if you think it might help (and who cares if he is offended.  In the end, the decision is yours and not his).  Also, I think ALL doctors don\u2019t like the fact that many of us have the ability to research our issues online and ask a lot of questions but I find that at least w/my MO, she seems happy I have gained the knowledge I have and ask the questions I do.  I think it tells her I understand what she is telling me and that she can feel confident something is not being misinterpreted.  Wish more doctors were like her!  And I don\u2019t understand how anyone can put so much faith in a doctor to not bother asking questions\u2026.that just seems so foreign to me and I wonder if those people just don\u2019t want to be bothered.  And regarding Claritin \u2013 I think I\u2019m one of those unfortunate that don\u2019t get relief from it.  And according to my MO, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve used it long term.  She said that med does not work that way.  So there are those of us who don\u2019t get relief (which is why there is a national medical study being done on the subject right now) but you need to find out for yourself. Jo \u2013 I do the same thing, and have done so for 10 years.  Ever since the headaches started, I was always so afraid I\u2019d miss something one of the specialists was telling me I had my husband w/me at every appointment.  That second set of ears is a necessity, in my opinion.  And w/cancer\u2026well the moral support goes w/out saying.  Babs \u2013 I will definitely be asking MO if there is something else besides Claritan.  If I recall what I had read about the studies and research on this subject, there is an alternative (Naproxen I think it was which is weird since that\u2019s an NSAID).  I could be wrong\u2026.but I am asking.  That was Hell Week \u2013 just like Honeybair said!!!!!  I guess I had in my head 5 days max for feeling so terrible\u2026.was not prepared for 9 days! Honeybair \u2013 what is the recipe for Baking Soda/Salt Mixture?  I may have asked before, but I can\u2019t remember.  I have, as you did, made the \u201cbatch\u201d of salt water rinse.  I keep the bottle by the coffeemaker and little Dixie cups up by the coffee cups.  Reminder every time I grab a cup of coffee (mostly decaf \u2013 just so everyone knows caffeine is NOT what is keeping me from sleeping but I LOVE the taste of coffee\u2026.not that it tastes like it should after chemo but that\u2019s another story) I pour my salt water mixture in a cup and start swishing as I walk to the bathroom to finish the exercise. Hope everyone is doing well.  As always, you are all in my thoughts and prayers! ",

Wrenn - I think you should start taking the anxiety meds you were given.  If your feeling the anxiety now and not sleeping, it likely is only going to worsen the closer chemo day comes, so start your meds, and get sleep so you are in the best possible shape for your chemo.  That's just my advise..... That heat feeling you have; if the BS said he's not worried, perhaps you can try to put it out of your mind?  For maybe a week.....and then see if the heat feeling is still there.  I guess what I'm saying is that the mind can sometimes play tricks on us making us believe we continue to feel more pain in an area that is actually \"remembered\" pain and not the actual pain level you are feeling (I hope I explained that so you can understand).  I'ts how our brains work sometimes (I know this from so many meetings with doctors about my headaches).  You do suffer from anxiety so I think your mind is always going to every little pain you feel (VERY NORMAL given your cirucumstances)...so perhaps once you start your anxiety meds the feeling might lessen.  That tightness feeling I agree w/KBeee.....that's a normal feeling from all I've read due to the mastectomy.  OR it could be Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome.  My doctor diagnosed me with that due to all the pains I had across the chest and down the arms - simple remedy.  I take Lyrica at bedtime and the pain is almost now non-existent.  The syndrome has to do with all the nerves that were cut during the surgery. Poodle-Mum - here is the link to the caps I got.  They are actually very inexpensive!  Only $3.25 each and they are worth so much more!  Mine are warmer that the ones the military provides my husband for work; and that's saying something.  Hope you like them if you get them.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053ALO66/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1  ",

I wouldn't worry about the dexamethasone causing a need for your Ativan - if you find you need it, then take it.  But the worse thing about the dex is the inability to sleep (which is why I think it weird he has you taking 2 at night - Good Golly, I don't know how you will sleep with taking steroids right before bed!).  Unless Ativan makes you really, really tired.... Dexamethasone helps with inflammation - I don't know your medical history but Taxotere (I believe - I know this is true with Taxol) causes muscle/nerve pain and that may be why your MO has you taking more that the teaching nurse said you would be taking.  Remember, the MO is highly trained and is taking your entire health issues into account when deciding the dosage of chemo and all medications related to offsetting the side effects. I'm glad you are \"excited\" and not overly nervous.  There is no need to be nervous....it is what it is, and you know what it does and what side effects COULD happen.  Again, most won't affect you.  And you don't know which ones will until you get started - so why worry?  You're going in with a good attitude and w/much less anxiety than I expected.  The Ativan must really be helping and if so, I'm glad you decided to start taking it a few days back.

I knew the cancer was caught very early and only because I was being scanned for post-chemo follow-up. In fact, as I explained to him, as foolish as it may sound\u2026.I feel blessed I got breast cancer because had I not, I never would have known of the lung issue since I had no symptoms. However, even though the 5 year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer overall is only 15%, he feels my chances are very good to be part of that 15%. It was caught early, it was a low stage, it did not show up in lymph node, I\u2019m young (generally speaking for most lung cancers), and the remaining lung tissues all look very healthy. He will follow me up every 3 months with scans the first year and he and my MO will try to coordinate scans needed. Scans will then be done every 6 months for another year or 2 and then annually. So if anything does develop, they\u2019ll find it quickly and we can deal with it. However, if it does recur either locally or distant, survival chances drop considerably. But I\u2019m not going to fret over it; I\u2019ll worry but I think that\u2019s normal (but I\u2019m not going to worry myself to the point of getting sick over it\u2026what comes will come and there is little I can do about it). I\u2019m healing nicely. Should be able to return to work part-time next week; work part-time a week or 2 and play it by ear on how I\u2019m feeling and return to full-time when I feel ready. The chest X-rays looked great so the lung is healing well, too. I developed a terrible sharp pain in my lower front right ribs which I didn\u2019t understand and figured it must have something to do with how they positioned me to do the surgery robotically. Well, I found out it was not that\u2026.apparently there are \u201cstrings\u201d of nerves that run from the side to front around/between the ribs. When the 4 incisions were made in between the ribs in the front/side/and back, they cut thru the nerves\u2026and the pains I\u2019m feeling are cut nerve pains that are distant from the incisions themselves. I had this same issue years ago with a different surgery but the pains were at the incision sites. This is not, which is weird, which is why I couldn\u2019t believe that was the issue\u2026until they explained how the nerves are very inter-woven in the area. I've come to terms with \"what could be\" regarding this so just take things one day at a time. Wrenn \u2013 You know, I often times write things that make perfect sense to me as well and then when I re-read it, I can see how it might not make sense to others. I think that\u2019s just writing in general; I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned with it being chemo-brain. I hope treating the thyroid issue helps with the feet and hands. I had terrible burning sensation which led to the Hand-Foot Syndrome diagnosis shortly after Thanksgiving. But mine then blistered and then peeled so I think that is very different from what you are talking about (but the burning feeling was so painful.... so I know what you are feeling). But I don\u2019t think \u201cburning\u201d pain is associated with neuropathy\u2026.so I think the Neurologist was probably correct but the tingling and numbness ARE associate with neuropathy and are common side effects of Taxotere. Yes \u2013 our chemo treatments are so very toxic it is too scary to think about it too much. We did what we could; you had too many issues before starting that your body just wasn\u2019t going to allow for such poison and not add to the problems. We can only do as much as our bodies will allow. There\u2019s always the benefit vs risk\u2026.. Vintagegal \u2013 see, all I had to do was look at your stats again and would have seen you did have surgery last year (obviously I\u2019ve forgotten I can do that!). I\u2019m glad you are doing well now, after all the surgeries and complications that came with the last. Aviva \u2013 what does the PS do to include the patient in the implant selection? This has always been a concern to me. I mean, I\u2019d like to know before surgery what to expect and I\u2019d like to have a little input\u2026it is my body afterall. I know it is all very technical and such, but you\u2019d think they would give me something to look at or read or something before my pre-op visit which is really just more of a physical (from what I understood when scheduling the surgery). They had told me during my expansions that \"Dr so and so will decide on which implants are best\" but I never pressed further thinking there had to be more to it. Hoping you get answers that help you decide the best way to proceed so you\u2019re happy with the outcome. KBee \u2013 Same question to you that I asked Aviva \u2013 what input did you have on your implant selection? I did read about the low survival rates being more due to the advanced stage of lung cancer when found; sort of. When a person digs a little deeper there is more data that explains that is not necessarily the case. There are many medical publications and studies that have been done that discuss the high rate of recurrence and the drastic drop in survival years if that happens, even for cancers that are found to be low stage. That\u2019s why the overall rate is at 15% I think \u2013 even though there are those of us who were very lucky to have it caught early, it also has such a high rate of recurrence and then the survival rate drops sharply. I\u2019ve read a lot since last Friday; keeping mostly to medical publications and reputable cancer sites (I don\u2019t read blogs or articles by places I\u2019ve never heard of) my only interest was in finding out as much as I could, medically speaking, so I could formulate questions to ask my surgeon. Although he said \u201cdon\u2019t read too much online\u201d\u2026.that\u2019s what all doctors seem to say today and I understand their reasoning. But, if like me, the reading is being done from published medical journals or reputable cancer sites\u2026they should welcome the patient learning about their condition. With cancer, though, I think the doctors are more apt to NOT want patients to read too much because they\u2019d prefer to just be hopeful. I don\u2019t prescribe to that thought \u2013 I\u2019m the patient and I deserve to know everything and anything I want about my medical state\u2026good and bad if I ask about it. I don\u2019t want surprises down the road.  And...I expected my surgeon to say what he did given that my cancer was low stage.  But also feel he purposely did not want to start talking about statistics because they are not very reassuring.   But I do have many things in my favor. A couple things work against me\u2026.but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it so I\u2019m just moving forward. Can\u2019t say I have a gung-ho positive attitude\u2026.but I\u2019ve the desire to live and make each day count more so now than I had even after the breast cancer diagnosis. And I appreciate those who mean the most to me more now\u2026  Isn't that the lessen when anything bad happens?  Appreciate what you have today because tomorrow may never come.   Babs \u2013 so glad they finally have a plan for your left side! Geez, I still don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve gotten thru all that\u2026.and knowing all that still lies ahead. I admire you and your courage!  I really don't think I'd have your courage facing so many surgeries. So happy your daughter was around during the hospitalizations. And that your son is more connected\u2026WOW! That is so nice to hear; and the grandkids\u2026.I\u2019m sure it means the world to you to have more interaction with them. I\u2019m so glad your family has gotten closer through all this!!! Ndgrrl \u2013 thank you. You know, I still think of you every time I put on a gown at the clinic or at the hospital. I swear, your hilarious story will stay with me forever\u2026..I\u2019m so glad you posted that here for us to enjoy (those that might not recall, scroll back to the Oct 25th post ndgrrl wrote). Your description of what happened always keeps me as lighthearted as I can be when in one of those silly gowns for any reason!!!!! Hope all is well with everyone else. ",

Finally got a release to return to work Part Time - my employer requested that I not return to full hours in the office as they want to help anyway possible to not delay a full recovery.  So Monday morning I start back at 3 hours a day for 1st week, increase to 4 hours a day the 2nd week and see how it goes from there.  They've been allowing me to work out of my home as I can and I'll continue to do that whilel working the short hours in the office.  I'm very blessed to have such wonderful employers (3 owners for the corp) and they've insisted we ask for any assistance needed in getting to all the upcoming chemo appointment (they know we have no family in the immediate area). Hope all is well with everyone.  I'll post this evening and let you know how my fill went.",

So, gotta wait for that appt on 9/16 \u2013 I hope to get the referral to Genetic Counseling to order test (as well as the Oncon Type test if they deem it necessary to determine my chemo regimen) requested and approved.   Do you have family history of breast cancer that they have all these tests done or lined up for you already?  VintageGAl1111 \u2013 congrats on your tube removal!!  I myself was also small breasted \u2013 I had been dealing with many califications and very dense breasts for about 10 years.  So when they found cancer, both BS and my family doctor recommended bilateral mastectomy.  The thought being, even if the cancer was contained, the density with my small breasts would make finding any recurrence of cancer in the future extremely difficult.  So, no \u2013 I did not have a 2nd surgery so soon after first as I agreed with the recommendation and just wanted both removed right from the start.  And good thing, too.  The invasive carcinoma was much more extensive than first thought AND pathology found the breasts were 95% dense (I\u2019m lucky the mammo\u2019s picked anything up in the first place!).  Sorry you have to go in again for surgery.  I really am.  But you sound like it didn\u2019t come as a huge surprise and were partly prepared for it so I do hope it goes well for you.  I will keep you in my prayers.  KBeee -  don\u2019t be silly.  You vent with us all you want and anytime you need!  Isn\u2019t that why we\u2019re all here?  We all sought out something that we needed and ended up here and have developed as quite a group and we are all going to have bad days and need to get things off our chests.  Please, don\u2019t hesitate or feel a need to explain.    It must be difficult being apart of a community event for 16 years and suddenly, because illness stuck itself into your life and limits what you can currently do.  But you\u2019ll be back on your feet in no time!  I hear you on not being able to work \u2013 I\u2019ve had to wait 4 weeks just to get back to limited hours (although I have been fortunate to have been working out of our home the last week and a half).  But I used to work out of the home nearly full-time and I\u2019m no fan of it \u2013 I prefer to be in the office, around people, around where work should be done\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s tough; I\u2019ll give you that.  But you work in a profession that requires physical duty and you just have to be patient and wait for your body to heal.  You only had surgery a week and a half ago \u2013 please remember you can do more damage to your own recovery if you jump back into work too soon.  Just try to be patient\u2026..  We\u2019re all in this together so please remember we\u2019re here for you on good days and bad.  JennH8 \u2013 congrats to you as well for getting your last drain removed (I am so jealous of you ladies!!!!!).  And congrats as well on getting your release for work.  Seems a lot of us have finally crossed that threshold, even if on a limited basis.  It\u2019s still a step in the right direction on getting back to our normal lives.  Jo6202 \u2013 Did you get a surgery date set up?  I feel so bad for you and VintageGal having had a surgery and now heading right back in for another.  My thoughts and prayers are with you!  Babs6287 \u2013 You, too?  Everybody\u2019s getting their drains removed except me\u2026\u2026..!!!!!!!!   I\u2019m happy for you!  You are all so lucky!!!    Please see my separate posting on how my first expansion went \u2013 updated (yes, things have changed since I posted 2 hours after my fill).  What I want you to know personally, is I had NO discomfort whatsoever during the expansion itself.  So please be careful when they say they will let you decide when it comes to filling beyond the 50cc; you might feel it is OK at the time, but that could change.  4-6 hours later you could be regretting that decision\u2026.obviously your call but keep that in mind.   I\u2019m so glad you had a wonderful evening with your grandchildren!!  Your daughter-in-law\u2026.I\u2019d like to come punch that gal in the nose and tell her to start acting like a human being!  She just sounds so cold to me.  Forgive me if I\u2019m stepping into an area where I perhaps should not, but it just angers me how she behaves and I can\u2019t get over the \u201click or spit\u201d comment (which seems came originally from her).  I just can\u2019t.  I shouldn\u2019t judge a person I don\u2019t even know, I know that, but I don\u2019t even want to know her based on what I\u2019ve heard.  Sorry \u2013 I had to get that off my chest.  But so glad you had a nice night in the city with your daughter and then had a nice get-together w/your son and his family later on.  Sounds like a wonderful evening and so happy you had that on your New Years Evening!  Jeannine \u2013 I hope your recovery is progressing well.  If you feel up to it today, please give us an update on how you\u2019re doing.  You are in my thoughts and prayers! Sorry ladies if I missed anyone! Lisa",

But that they seem to be set higher than where they naturally fell?)  And forget about my wearing the cami or mastectomy bra w/prostheses. The cami feels terrible against my chest and both garments come up so high there is no way I can wear any of my work clothing w/o these garments peeking out (I mean, come on, they like almost reach my collar bone, for goodness sakes!).  So I\u2019ll be shopping for prosthesis that are easier to work with (I was provided w/the ones w/fiberfill so as I\u2019m expanded, I can remove more and more fiberfill).  Yeah, I removed some (they seemed so huge; I think I just got so used to seeing myself w/no breasts that what they gave me, seems way too big). As I removed some, the forms themselves got lumpy looking (is there nothing easy in this whole ordeal?).  As time goes on and I remove more, I only see them getting lumpier.  And forget the mastectomy bra they gave me, it sits too high w/no adjustable straps!   I just ordered and received 4 tube tops and that\u2019s going to be my garment of choice I believe for the foreseeable future.  Anyway, that\u2019s my experience about 24 hours after first expansion.  And my dilemma w/prosthesis \u2013 so if any of you have or had the same issues and can make suggestions, please let me know.  Lisa",

I give you ladies a lot of credit looking ahead for holidays and how your chemo schedule is going to fit in.  Is everyone else getting their chemo at 3 week intervals?  See, mine are 2 weeks apart and since the fatigue sets in somewhere between days 2-5\u2026.I find it almost impossible to try to figure out \u201chow will I feel at Thanksgiving or Christmas\u201d so I\u2019m just going with the schedule they gave me.  Perhaps if it was 3 weeks apart it might be easier to look at a calendar and say \u201cthis week I want to avoid SE\u2019s as much as possible\u201d and then sched chemo appropriately.  I just don\u2019t see that it would make much diff in my situation.  Babs \u2013 perhaps you can help me out with this since you had the same meds used that I\u2019m to receive (did you receive every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks?). I hope everyone that has chemo starting in September & October keeps up to date in this thread.  I think we\u2019ve all bonded in this experience and I personally think it will be easier to keep up to date with everyone if we continue using this thread.  Although some of us will be in the Sept 2013 chemo thread and others in Oct 2013 thread\u2026..it might be hard to keep track of how everyone is progressing.  Hoping everyone is having a great day!",

Thank you for all the chemo info \u2013 I had not realized you, too, had the same regimen.  I will definitely visit the January 2013 chemo thread \u2013 but not until after\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to read the daily turmoil\u2019s \u2013 yet \u2013 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get there soon enough\u2026..  Poodle-mum \u2013 I hear you about everything looking like a dress!  I was small chested to begin with, but I did have a chest!  Now, well not even the \u201cbaby-boobs\u201d I hear others have \u2013 just a lot of nothing.  And of course nothing fits.  Nor will it until we get some more expansions and I know they will take it slow given all the post-op pain I had.  But at least w/tubes being removed I have that horrible tight-tape feeling across my chest gone!  I can actually wear my foobs (but they get yanked off as soon as I get home from work) but at least I can tolerate them while having to be out in public.  So, progress!  I\u2019m assuming KBeee is likely feeling the effects of the first chemo?  I see she has been quiet here as well as the Sept 2013 Chemo thread.  She may just be busy this weekend \u2013 but I\u2019m going to say an extra prayer for that little spit-fire this evening.  If I recall these are the days she expected to feel poorly and perhaps her expectations became reality\u2026.  Good night all.  As always, each one of you are in my prayers and lets all hope for a happy, healthy and as pain-free as possible week ahead!  (sorry if I missed anyone \u2013 if I did it was not intentional)",

That \u201cnails on a chalkboard\u201d feeling \u2013 I think you are explaining that terrible tight-taped up feeling I had been having that was driving me insane and was unable to wear foobs or even have any clothing rest on my chest.  And it all went away as soon as those dang tubes were unwound from inside my chest \u2013 so hoping that is what is causing your feeling that way and it goes away when the packing can be removed for good.  It brought a smile to my face when I hopped on this morning and saw your post \u2013 I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re doing better!  Babs \u2013 I hope and pray you have a safe trip to Fla.  It\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it?  Seems like that in most families that the only time we all get together is at a funeral \u2013 and even though we all realize it, it never changes anything.  We still don\u2019t make the time to get together to celebrate together with everyone alive\u2026..life is strange in so many ways.  It is too bad your daughter can\u2019t make it; but it was nice that you had her home to aid in your recovery.  KBeee \u2013 I believe my MO is considering the Taxotere if the Adriamycin cannot be used.  I don\u2019t know these drugs, don\u2019t pretend to understand them, and it\u2019s very unusual for me to say that in anything having to do w/my medical care.  I\u2019m usually one who wants, no\u2026needs, to know everything about everything in every step of my care (it all stems back to some trust issues years ago when I was naïve and thought the medical profession knows and does what\u2019s best for the patient \u2013 well, not always.  We lost our son at age 5 weeks because I trusted the doctors during my pregnancy.  I should not have; but found that out too late).  But here w/chemo\u2026.it\u2019s all too much for me to wrap my head around.  So I stay away from reading too much online or even at these posts and am counting on my medical team \u2013 I\u2019m trusting in them to do what is best for me\u2026.I have to because it\u2019s too much for me to understand. I\u2019m unsure how the Cardiologist is going to determine what chemo gets used.  She said he is very interested and is doing studies on how chemo affects the heart.  I don\u2019t know how taking any blood pressure medication could strengthen/protect my heart so that they could still use Adriamycin (that\u2019s what MO said he might do); I don\u2019t have high blood pressure.  I have had no symptoms of anything w/my heart but have been being treated for high cholesterol for about 7 years \u2013 very well managed w/Lovastatin and diet.  Only time my BP is raised is when I\u2019m in clinic w/excruciating headache and that can be attributed to pain \u2013 no other times is BP EVER been a problem.  So I don\u2019t understand all this either\u2026..and after my husband and I talked last night we couldn\u2019t recall that she was going to decide chemo med based on Cardiologist visit.  We seem to recall she was talking about making that decision based on what US found\u2026..so I\u2019m just overwhelmed when I stop and think about it so I stop even thinking about it.  I\u2019ll just follow thru what they tell me to do and put my trust in them and hope the outcome is good in the end.   I\u2019ll freely admit I don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t have to do the AC treatment; it worried me about the issues w/the heart just because there is heart disease in my family.  But at the same time I want whatever chemo is best to kill whatever cancer is still lurking.  In fact, yesterday was the first time I heard \u201cmetastasis\u201d in reference to my cancer; Radiologist brought it up stating that is what my final pathology states in relation to what they originally found in sentinal node on right side.  That word scares me so I want whatever chemo is needed to make that word go away!  But like I was told yesterday \u2013 they don\u2019t want to cure the cancer just to have me die from a heart attack \u2013 so I guess I\u2019m going to have to face having percentages put in front of me again and having to make difficult decisions.  I hate all this \u2013 nothing is simple here and I thought we were on a pretty standard treatment plan and the \u201ctoughest\u201d decision I had to make was chemo or no chemo. Which was an easy decision based on the great reduction of recurrence rates I would see doing chemo.  Now it looks like \u201cprotect the heart\u201d vs \u201ckill the cancer\u201d\u2026.I\u2019m not a good gambler and don\u2019t want to have to make that decision.  I\u2019m just stopping there\u2026..I\u2019m sure everyone can see my inner conflict and I don\u2019t want to deal w/it at the moment so I\u2019ll leave it all there.  I just want to move forward, already!  I\u2019m tired of waiting and we\u2019re getting into the 8 weeks post surgery timeframe and given the aggressiveness of my cancer\u2026.I don\u2019t want any more delays.  But I understand 12 weeks is the absolute cut-off time and chemo really must begin before that time in order to be most effective.  And obviously I\u2019m very concerned that there is lingering cancer ready to do me more harm in the right nodes and any more delays might compromise my outcome\u2026..  On a brighter note \u2013 I must say I am very happy you are tolerating your first round of chemo well!   Honeybair \u2013 I am truly sorry you still can\u2019t sleep well.   It\u2019s so important to sleep \u2013 might you consider a sleeping aid to try to keep you sleeping?  It\u2019s very frustrating but the body must rest to heal and you don\u2019t sound like you rest appropriately on a regular schedule.  I don\u2019t know if you read my previous posts on this.  I used sleeping pills for 3 nights and that was all I needed.  I finally rested properly and have had no issues sleeping naturally after I stopped taking the pills for 3 nights.  It might help you\u2026..  Poodle-mum \u2013 yes, it would be nice to wake from this nightmare and we would all have our lives back with healthy breasts.  Unfortunately, our new \u201cnormal\u201d is what we have and is what we must deal with.  It\u2019s tough at times, but this forum is so helpful in giving us all a place to vent our frustrations and the good friendships we\u2019ve developed helps us get thru the bad days and brings the \u201cfighter\u201d back to us to see things thru and move forward.  Our bodies are not who we are\u2026.it\u2019s what\u2019s inside that makes us who we are and that\u2019s what is most important to remember.  Jacquie \u2013 congrats on graduating to a regular bra!  Nice getting out of that vest, isn\u2019t it!  I can\u2019t speak on the Oncotype test as I didn\u2019t need it.  And know very little about it but it sound like you have a difficult decision to make.  It\u2019s good to take your time and do your research before making any decisions.  Oh, and sorry to hear you need to have the colonoscopy\u2026.I feel for anyone going in for THAT test!  I\u2019ve not had to have one yet, but my husband has and it doesn\u2019t look like a very pleasant test to prep for\u2026.so I feel for everyone having to go thru that!  I hope everyone has a pleasant day and in good spirits!  I\u2019ve got my wig shopping this afternoon\u2026..I\u2019m not in the mood but whatever. ",

I completely understand your post and that was what I felt my family doctor was trying to tell me as well as MO.  At least in the back of my head....but I'm a stubborn German gal and sometimes don't hear what is being said to me.  Good news - just returned from Cardiology and my heart is perfectly healthy.  Apparently there is some \"grey\" area on interpreting the ECG; he looked it over and looked for any beginning signs of heart disease.  Put a huge smile on my face when he returned and said \"your heart is very healthy - no signs of heart disease.  Any of the factors we can see in early stage heart disease are not seen at all on the ECG.  Furthermore, I interrpret your heart muscle output at 60%, not the 50% as originally noted on the test results.  You are well in the normal range and it is my opinion this is the way your heart has always been\".  GREAT news! He, too, was of the belief based on the notes he received from my MO that it is the entire medical teams view to treat this cancer with everything possible and with the best chemo they have.  He said the note he received made it very clear MO was concerned if the heart muscle issue could not be resolved if this right node surgery shows cancer lingering there because she feels I NEED the AC-T to properly and fully rid this cancer once and for all.  That hit home as well; when he read me her note to him. So, all clear.  He said there are a few (and he was clear it was a few) human studies showing Coreg does in fact protect the heart muscle for Adriamycin use.  Nothing is guaranteed; but we both agreed to use it as added \"insurance\" to protect the heart. Thank you, Honeybair.  You very plainly spelled out what I needed to hear!  But having my emotions tied in knots wondering if I was now dealing w/heart disease on top of cancer and not knowing if I was even healthy enough to get the best cancer care possible - well I was torn (as I'm sure my post showed). So, surgery is scheduled for right node removal/biopsy and port placement first thing 10/9.  MO and chemo to begin on 10/10 - and I am going to take the advice of my doctor and go w/AC-T now that I know my heart is healthy. Sincerely, Honeybair, thank you for relaying your experience!  It puts things in better perspective for me.  And I'm so happy your slept....in bed....in comfort!  I grew to HATE our recliner but have developed a fondness for it again now that I don't sleep in it every night.

Good thing I'm not nervous and uptight about it because it would be a real roller-coaster ride now with twice having a start date just to have a halt called at the last minute when meeting w/MO beforehand. She said after reading yesterdays surgery notes she would be more comfortable waiting a week before we start chemo. She wants to give my body at least a week to give that incision in my underarm a chance to heal instead of starting chemo today and having that wound not heal as quickly as it should. She also would really like to have pathology back on the node they removed before we start so she knows exactly what we are dealing with before any chemo is administered. So....we wait another week. She said prelim pathology could come back tomorrow but the full report will not be in until early next week. The bad side is that it will now put me in the week opposite my husbands 4 work day schedule AND will put me on chemo treatments the weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Oh well, can't keep putting it off (well, really have not been putting it off - health issues have surfaced that just must be handled first) but I am a bit relieved they didn't have to access that port less than 24 hours after it was placed (that was giving me a bit of anxiety). Still have considerable pain in the underarm and between that incision and the port placement, it seems to have made the right breast quite sensitive and feeling aggravated. I guess that's to be expected w/everything they did yesterday. But today was not a loss. I asked some questions that have been piling up and she gave me very clear and informative answers. So a good informative visit. Chemo is now set to start a week from today (hmmmm, will it or won't it???). It's schedule to happen, anyway. Hope all is well with everyone! As always, you are all in my thoughts and prayers!",

We can learn from one another. I have a pain journal I use at times....I'll just make some adjustments to it and use it as my chemo journal. Thanks for the idea! Did you check w/your MO about Benedryl? I had read somewhere (don't remember where) that they might use that as a pre-med to chemo and you'd want to be careful to not use too much. I know you are a paramedic and I don't need to tell you, but I worry about taking any med, no matter how innocent it might normally be, while on chemo. I've read a lot over the last month about women having problems sleeping because of the steroids in pre-meds. I asked MO yesterday if I had that issue if it was OK to take one of the sleeping pills my family doc had prescribed back when I was having so many issues w/BMX recovery and not sleeping well. She said that was OK (it's the generic of Ambien and I only take 1/2 the dose prescribed because they seem to hit me pretty hard) to use. Do you know if you receive Benedryl in your premeds?",

Glad you ladies liked the cap - wasn't that just an awesome price?!  By the way, I have a small head but my husband has a large head and they fit him just fine as well.",

Regarding the ginger your MO spoke about....as I stated after my last chemo, I had horrible, terrible, lengthy fatigue (4 full days longer than the first chemo - which is why I had not posted much (and then once feeling well enough to get to work, I was so busy I was completely wiped out when I would get home!).  Anyway....yesterday before chemo I talked to my MO about the horrible fatigue.  She suggested that I take the Dexamethasone 1x a day on days 4-6 post chemo.  Apparently what I felt is known to happen....from the studden stoppage of the Dexomethsone!  I never would have thought that, but it makes sense.  So I will take 2x/day for the 3 days following chemo and 1x/day for 2-3 days.  In addition - Ginger.  But not just any Ginger.  She pulled up a study that shows 2000mg/day of AMERICAN Ginger has shown great success in helping with Chemo Related Fatigue.  So, I stopped at Walgreens on the way home and they sell no Ginger (that's weird, I thought).  So, yes, you guessed it, I ordered it from Amazon.com.  I should have it tomorrow so I will begin taking in on Monday or Tuesday (when the fatigue really starts to set in). Your chemo bag....you know, you really don't need much. In fact, I brought so much based on what I had read at the chemo threads on my first visit and felt really foolish!  All I bring with me now is:  small pillow for behind my neck so I can rest comfortably; my Kindle; a travel mug full of crushed ice to suck on during the A/C push; a pair of hospital socks (w/vinyl treads so I don't slip when running to the rest room) because I'm just not comfy sitting there for 2-3 hours w/my shoes on; and usually a granola bar or protein bar.  My wonderful husband always leaves once they get the IV's going and comes back with either muffins or bagels and cream cheese - and I usually eat one while the Cytoxin is running (since that seems to take the longest).  The infusion centers have blankets - mine actually has heated recliners as well so I don't even need a blanket.  That's it, Wrenn.  You don't need anything else.  If you don't have a Kindle or a book you want to read, perhaps you can pick up a Crossword Puzzle Book - something to make the time pass.  At the infusion center I go to, they have DVD players w/DVD's to help patients or their guests pass the time. I actually prefer my husband run out and do whatever he wants during my chemo.  Why?  I want to relax; which means reading or doing a crossword puzzle.  I simply do not feel like visiting - although I do with my chemo nurse when she is doing the A/C push mostly.  She had at least 4 of us she was responsible for yesterday so she had little time to visit which was fine....I wanted to rest or sleep if possible. You'll find what makes you most comfortable.  I might suggest that you not look at the bags of meds hanging or even to look at the IV in your arm.  Keep you mind elsewhere (i.e. Kindle or Crossword Puzzle Book) and don't pay any attention to what is actually happening.  Unless, of course, something doesn't feel right, then speak up immediately.  I've not had any issues - well, not during chemo anyway.  This last time I had a lot of anxiety the night before and day of chemo.  I couldn't eat because my stomach was doing flip-flops - not because chemo was making me nervous....it's what I know about how I will feel several days after chemo.  But I feel better now that my MO knows how poorly I was feeling and we have a plan in place to take care of it, hopefully. And I want to remind you of what my MO told me right before my first chemo:  \"if you even have a thought in your head that is saying \"should I call my MO?\" then that means you should be on the phone calling your MO!  They are staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  They have a HUGE bag of tricks to help us through whatever problems we might be having.  So please remember that advise, Wrenn.  To me, she could not have made me feel more comforted and cared for by saying anything else.  It has made/does make a world of difference to know they are simply a phone call away, anytime I might need them and WANTING  to help. Any questions, here is your chance, Wrenn.  Others have been thru more than I here and I'm sure everyone is willing to answer any questions you might have so let them fly.....  ",

I'm not a happy person, and quite negative which is why I've kept from posting. Very worried about upcoming Taxol and told my MO on Thurs she can talk till she's blue in the face and I'll still not feel reassured. See, the worst SE's w/ the A/C are fatigue and flu like symptoms...the 2 symptoms they say are often worse with Taxol. She knows my reservations and has finally said \"let's wait and see - we'll get you thru this\". Well, we all know what that means...no reassurance there. I've attempted to be positive but chemo for me has been cumulative and has been worse each time. I understand there is hope that I may not feel as bad w/Taxol - but that hope is minimal but I could be surprised. Wish I could have said something more positive there...but you all know me well enough to know I say it as it is... I'm a little behind on my fills; but should only need 2 more. They put in 350 expanders and said they can expand up to 100 above that limit which is their intent. They asked what size I'd like to end up at and I said \"a full B cup would be fine\" - so they said they are going to fill to 450 - IF I can tolerate it. And I can do it in little intervals; chemo won't be complete until end of January so exchange can't happen until April'ish timeframe so I can take my time w/the remaining fills. I want to hear all about everyone elses exchanges, though! I've complained about my expanders riding so high and towards the armpits I can't even wear a regular bra because the tight buldges on my chest are not pliable to fill out my bras. I have to wear tube tops and I found an old demi bra of my daughters from years ago that works somewhat (these things are just so far out from center I've no clue what type of pocket is going to be there for the final silicone implants!) PS assured me things will be fine. Has anyone else had problems like this? Babs - I'm glad you're taking your pain meds as directed. Extended pain is a bad thing and hampers healing...none of us likes having to take pain pills but they are needed and should be taken when one is in pain. I cannot imagine being opened 3 times on one side either - good golly, that has to hurt and I feel for you! I do hope you are recovering well otherwise; any idea when you get to go home?",

So tell me, did your final implants lay lower on your chest than your TE's?  And did you have any problem with them shifting to your armpits (I have like a 1-1/2 inch gap between my TE's...much too far apart than what normal breasts should be) and if you did, did the final implants end up closer together? I'm interested in how your nipple recon turns out, given what I had read.  Not that I'm willing to have that done, but want to know how yours turn out when all is said and done. Don't get worried about the swelling, please.  I'm still swollen under the right underarm and my last surgery in that area was back in October - 6 months ago!  I was told early on (at my first post-op visit w/BS after BMX) that the swelling can take a very long time to resolve...mastectomies are major surgery and does a real job on our bodies and it can take up to a year for the body to regulate itself.  So please don't have any thoughts that take you to dark places.  Keep an eye on it and if it does not resolve in a couple months, they'll probably do an US to take a looksy.   I'm glad to hear that you didn't have a whole lot to say about your implants and are satisfied with the outcome - that makes me feel better that someone else has already entered into this phase nearly as blind as I seem to be on the whole final implant issue and they are happy with the results. Take care!",

I still have 2 drains and am 3+ weeks post surgery.  The darn things just keep putting out fluid.  Had 2 days of 30ml on one side and made appt to get it removed but in the 24 hours before appt the stupid fluid output rose to 50ml (and the morning reading on the date of my appt looked like it would be a replay).  They kept both in, still taking antibiotics and now they are going to require I have 3 consecutive days of 30ml or less before they remove. I agree with what I've read here wholeheartedly!  I'm finding the site where they are inserted to be getting more and more tender so last week my PS gave me lidocaine to put on as my leisure to help alleviate this.  She told me \"some women are just outside the norms and end up having the tubes in longer.  The risk of removing them is too high for infection at current output so even though the longer there in there is a risk of infection at the site they are sewn in.....does not outweight the higher risk of removing them too soon\".  VERY frustrated, I hate these things!  I can't wear a bra or cami for compression because the elastic lays right at the area where the tubes are sewn in (very painful within a short amount of time).  I'm going to order some tube tops from Amazon so I can have some compression without the pain of something resting on the site of tube insertion. Regarding \"not going....\" - best thing to do is eat dark green veggies.  I added to that Dulcosate, Miralax, 2 probiotic yogurts and lots of fluid.  After 1 week, it all worked - too well.  Overshot the mark, if you know what I mean.  But felt good to finally \"go\".  I've always read that the dark green veggies are your best bet. Glad to meet all you wonderful gals - here at the Aug 2013 thread.  Will be watching everyones progress along the way and hoping all goes well for every one of us moving forward.",

 But your daughter\u2026..warms my heart to hear what a wonderful and caring and loving young lady she is and obviously a very close friend to you.  Thank you so much for sharing your story with us!  Your son may come around it time so don\u2019t lose hope.  mrtw43 \u2013 welcome!  Glad you found us and hope you find and join in our discussions from now on.  We seem to have developed as quite a group here and I, for one, can\u2019t say how helpful it has been to me.  I hope you find the same.  (by the way\u2026it took me almost 3 weeks post surgery to find these discussion boards so I\u2019m a little like you in being a \u201clate-starter\u201d.  I wish I had found it sooner but we\u2019re here now and can \u201ccompare notes\u201d and support each other.)  Your son sounds wonderful!  It is tough to have to tell children something bad and it never fails to amaze me how well they deal with it.  I believe it has to do with how they are told and how they are reassured\u2026..which speaks to good parenting.  So kudos to you for raising a smart young man!   ndgrrl \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind my asking, how old are your children?  Did you have the Onco DX test yet or are you waiting to see Oncology to order the test?  I hate the waiting too but I\u2019m of the belief there are other women with worse cancers than myself and they must be seen and taken care of first (and I\u2019ve no problem stepping aside and taking an appt further out so those with more urgent need get their care first \u2013 I\u2019d hope others would do the same for me if the roles were reversed).  Hate the wait but understand the reason so I just find things to keep busy and figure I\u2019ll get all my info soon enough\u2026\u2026  JennH8 \u2013 glad you got your shower and like your new baby boobs!  I looked at a lot of pre and post reconstructive surgeries and found them bothersome\u2026\u2026but since it\u2019s what I have, it\u2019s what I have \u2013 the scars just kind of freak me out but they do lessen in appearance in time so I should be fine once EVERYTHING is done and over with.  Did you have nipple sparing MX?  I had no choice; mine are gone and after reading what\u2019s involved in reconstructing that particular little piece of me \u2013 I\u2019m not doing it!  Just my preference and then I don\u2019t have to ever worry about \u201cshow thru\u201d from now on so it has its benefits.   Thanks for sharing your children with us.  I can understand how hard it was for your youngest and that how she took it was worse than the diagnosis (ok \u2013 I can\u2019t understand because I didn\u2019t experience that myself but I can imagine).  How did your step-grandchildren take the news?  My daughter and husband both have been my rocks \u2013 my daughter is so positive and supportive I cannot believe how blessed we are for her!  She took the news worse when the mammo\u2019s and ultrasound came back and I called her that evening to tell her that something was \u201cnot right\u201d and all the testing that I was going to be having over the next week \u2013 she took it very hard.  But once the diagnosis came in, her positivity and love just kicked in full gear and she\u2019s been by my side the whole time offering encouragement beyond words.  She might not have been here physically, more because I asked her to stay put and come home at Christmas instead, but miles don\u2019t matter to me.  I was in her shoes at her age as well, being far from home, so I understand the desire to fly home when a crisis arises but I knew she could be just as supportive if she stayed put as if she were here at home with us.  Thank God for good children, right!

I had not heard anything about the \"turning\" - how can that even happen w/implant that is tear-shaped?  I believe my PS said prior to surgery that they will be using textured silicone implants on me - and that I need to know I will likely have some wrinkles.  I just laughed at him and said \"I got wrinkles everywhere else, why should I be concerned if I have them on my breasts?\".  He said saline would cause over-wrinkling in me - so that's why he's going w/textured silicone. Don't you all find it odd that we even have to ask one another these questions?  I've had way too much time on my hands during recovery and I've got to say, although I made the best decision I could with the information I was provided, I really wasn't provided with a whole lot of what to expect with the reconstruction.  Just the basics.  I'm almost getting the feeling at least you and Babs might be in the same camp?  It actually makes me angry to think about it (so I don't think on it often) - I just HATE when I'm not provided with every and all details before agreeing to any type of procedure.  And being a regular lay-person, how was I to know there were more questions I should have been asking?  Know what I mean? Just my random thoughts......",

\u2013 should be provided to all women after breast surgery!).  Does not have the pouches, the drain loops slip on the belt (which is adjustable) and the belt closes w/Velcro.  I\u2019m glad mine does not have the pouches \u2013 the cami they fitted me for last week has the pouches for the drains and my tubes tend to kink when I put them in the pouch.  Not good.  So if I had pouches on the belt it would probably do the same thing but the way they hang from the loops, seems to work fine.  I swear, I will burn this belt once the drains are removed!  Kind of like women in the 60\u2019s with their bras!!!  Are you looking for just regular knit caps?  I know you do a bit of research and I\u2019d like you to read up on scalp tenderness during chemo.  From what I\u2019ve seen, many women find just the seams inside caps can cause a great deal of discomfort.  There are turbans you could use \u2013 made for chemo patients.  Kind of makes you look like a chemo patient but I think what\u2019s most important for all of us is comfort.  There are so many places online you can find either lined caps or seamless caps but you have to look for them.  Turbans do look most comfortable but any that I get I\u2019ll probably dress up with a scarf (again, I saw this on You Tube and it looks pretty easy).  Hope that helps.  Wrenn \u2013 yes, our dates are really close on everything.  Did you see Oncology yet?  I see mine on 9/16 and I\u2019m interested to learn more about TNBC and what survival rates are for this type of cancer.  They say it is a more aggressive cancer so\u2026.what does that mean for treatment?  Know what I mean?  All I know is that it is rare for Caucasian women under 50-60 years old and it seems TNBC isn\u2019t well known with the general public.  Of course, I\u2019ve only read bits and pieces so I know very little other than what I stated.  I have visited the thread \u201cCalling all TN\u2019s\u201d but it seems some of the women have very advanced cancer and that\u2019s not something I need to be reading about at this stage in the game.  It\u2019s a great forum for them; it\u2019s just not something I want to read about because I know it will only worry me.  I do believe my reconstruction has caused a large part of my pain, discomfort and just about everything else since surgery.  Like I\u2019ve said previously, I made the best decision I could with the information I had\u2026\u2026if I had knows of all the issues that have plagued me I honestly don\u2019t believe I would have opted for reconstruction.  Or at least I would have been better prepared!  Who  can say what we \u201cmight\u201d have done \u2013 hindsight is 20/20 so I\u2019m probably just babbling on \u2026\u2026  Honeybair \u2013 isn\u2019t it so strange how we are all told either nothing or different things when we were discharged?  I was not told to exercise, I was not told NOT to exercise; just nothing about it.  But I had read Dr Love\u2019s Breast Book prior to BMX and read about the issue of Frozen Shoulder if a woman kept her arm(s) still following surgery.  That made me nervous enough to want to make sure I did what I could to avoid it so I started using my arms and hands as much as possible the night of my surgery.  Kept increasing it every day.  I hope PT helps you get your range of motion back, I really do.  It really stinks that not only do we have to deal with losing our breasts and having our underarms slashed (oh, and then having tubes sewn in our sides) \u2013 like that\u2019s not enough, all ready! \u2013 then there are all the secondary issues that we need to worry about!  And now, because of what you were told, you\u2019ve got shoulder problems!  My heart goes out to you and I hope PT can provide you with good relief and full use of your arm in time!  Poodle-mum \u2013 you can post here all you want!  You are part of our little group and feel free to vent \u2013 we all need to and who better to listen than those of us who are  going thru similar experiences.  You said you didn't really have anyone to talk to so please, please, continue being a part of our group!!  We all worry together and hope you know we are here for you always.  I don\u2019t know anything about the massage but I can tell you this \u2013 I would not have been doing it at 3 weeks post op.  I tend to agree with you (and we both seemed to have experienced more pain than most after surgery) that it is too soon.  However, I am not in your situation and have no fluid build up (but I still have 2 tubes and drains).  You may NEED to do the massage for your health\u2026.can you get an interpreter to call the surgeons office for you to make sure you have the instructions correct?  I worry when you have this communication barrier that you are getting all the information the way that you should.  Don't forget either, you can always get a second opinion if you worry about the instructions you are being given.  You can always click the \u201csearch\u201d button on the top left of the screen of the discussion board here at Breastcancer.org \u2013 type in \u201cbreast massage\u201d and that should direct you to other threads on that particular issue.  You could also Google \"seroma and breast massage\" and see what comes up.  I hope you find the answers and you have my sympathies with your continued pain.  I do hope you find that little turning point soon where the pain changes to discomfort \u2013 it will happen; just takes more time for some of us.  KBeee \u2013 I wish we lived closer as well.  I\u2019d love some of that salsa and sauce!!!  You sound like you have such a great group of guys to work with and it sounds like you had a great time in your class with all of them.  I hope all your wigs come in as well, but at least you have caps should you need something if the wigs are delayed.  Make sure you get that picture I\u2019ve been asking to see!  I\u2019m going to be watching for it.  Oh \u2013 I\u2019d love for you to come rip these drains out as well.  In fact, I\u2019m getting so close to telling PS that I just might do it one day as they are wearing on me emotionally and I don\u2019t want to go there!  I have my MO appt Monday 9/16; don\u2019t  know yet first chemo date but I\u2019ll find out soon enough \u2013 and I want these drains out before that time!  I was told that if they are not out it will NOT delay my start of chemo \u2013 which sounds odd since it is such a HUGE concern for infection I\u2019d think MO wouldn\u2019t want chemo started until that danger is past \u2013 but what do I know?  JennH8 \u2013 Congrat on the return to work.  Doesn\u2019t it feel great getting a little bit of that freedom back!!!!!!  Pam358 \u2013 Gosh, I hate all the waiting but we have seemed to have gotten used to it.  Can you tell me why you had a CT Scan vs a PET Scan?  I was told it is normal in my situation to have a PET Scan prior to chemo (my right node tested positive for cancer) so I\u2019m curious why you just had the CT Scan.  That really stinks that you have to wait over a week for results!!!!!!!  Again, sorry if I missed anyone!!!  Hope everybody has a great day!  Keep strong and keep healthy!  Lisa",

Nor does the seroma Poodle-mum is having to do therapy for!) when either one or more drains have been removed that now I worry something like that might happen.  It doesn\u2019t help that I get a couple days w/levels at 30ml or below and then the next day it jumps up 30-40%.  My fear \u2013 I get them removed and my body can\u2019t absorb whatever fluid remains and then the ultimate of fears\u2026..infections and TE removal.  Gosh \u2013 does the worry never end with these surgeries??????   Really \u2013 I\u2019ve never heard of so many individuals having so many issues all stemming from the same/similar surgery!  Jeanine \u2013 that you for your input on chemo.  It\u2019s really nice having this forum that we can connect with one another and we can have the benefit of others who have had to face some of the issues previously.  It\u2019s really good to know fatigue sets in around days 3-5; I guess that certainly changes my mind on wanting chemo on Fridays!  Right now I\u2019m thinking Tuesdays sound like the best day for me as well but we will see if I have a choice.  Sorry to hear about your delay in reconstruction.  But radiation and reconstruction don\u2019t always go hand in hand and since killing any remaining cancer is most important\u2026..well, reconstruction will need to wait.  It\u2019s still hard knowing you have to wait so you have my sympathies.    Is drinking water important? (haha!)  And yes, onward we march \u2013 for we must!  Poodle-mum \u2013 good for you doing the Run for a Cure.  Please be careful \u2013 you\u2019ve not had an easy time of recovery and doing too much is going to be a real set-back.  Please pay attention to your body (regardless of what your head tells you) and if you need to stop \u2013 please stop.  The fact that you are even starting the run is impressive enough.  Just don\u2019t overdo it and then set back a full recovery.  OK?  Oh, by the way \u2013 YOU GO GIRL!  Just pay attention to what your body is telling you.  KBeee \u2013 thank you as well for the info on low hemoglobin.  Although, as I was telling my husband \u201cI guess I need to eat more red meat and then drink OJ because vitamin C helps absorb iron\u201d \u2013 I have to say I almost wanted to vomit after I said it out loud.  Drink OJ while eating a hamburger?  Drink OJ while enjoying a juicy steak?  See what I mean???  So I ask you this \u2013 how about taking a Vitamin C tablet after eating a meal w/red meat?  Sounds more palatable to me but I don\u2019t know if it would be as effective.   I\u2019m amazed at your energy!  I\u2019m like Wrenn \u2013 walking to the mailbox even tires me still!  It is amazing the difference a week can make.  I didn\u2019t hear a \u201cpity party\u201d last week; I heard what is becoming very familiar here and that is \u201cwhy does recovery seem to take so long\u201d and \u201cI just want to be able to return to my normal routine\u201d.  Not pity \u2013 more frustration.  But you had time, shook it off, and are in a better place today.  It is amazing when each of us reaches that \u201cturning point\u201d where things finally start to turn in the right direction and it does so very quickly.  It really helps emotionally when we physically turn that corner!   I think you are bound to have a very large and supportive party come Wednesday!  Being a firefighter and paramedic puts you in the community spotlight and I think those of us who so appreciate everything you folks do for us\u2026.well, its such a little thing for us to come and show you our support in what might seem like a little way yet it means so much.  You\u2019ve got a great group of guys to work with, a community that is surrounding you with their love and gratitude and support \u2013 you\u2019re going to get thru this next stage just fine.  You\u2019re a very lucky gal!   Your wig stories are a hoot!  I can picture your husband\u2019s startled look when seeing the wig on the dresser \u2013 and I\u2019m glad it gave you a good laugh.  We do need to find humor where possible\u2026..  I\u2019m glad you (and your daughter) like the wigs.   Aviva \u2013 I checked out the thread you mentioned on head coverings.  I\u2019d like to pass on another site I found that offered free shipping and I received my order in 4 business days.  Here is the web address:  http://www.scarfand.com/ I found a couple of really cute, inexpensive scarves and found the prices incredibly reasonable   I\u2019ve reviewed plenty of You Tube videos and learned there is NO size that is off limits!  I ordered one that is actually a Pashmina \u2013 and it works great for a head scarf (you just need to watch whatever videos you can find online to learn how to tie and tuck, tie and tuck).   I\u2019ll tell you this\u2026.tie and tuck is much harder than I thought!!!  I guess it takes practice, practice, practice.  I\u2019ve already received 3 hats/caps and have several more sitting in shopping carts at different sites.  If I\u2019m as terrible at tying scarves when I\u2019m fatigued from chemo as I am now\u2026.well, I need backup and I found quite a few really cute hats/caps.  Since it will be the winter months when we all go thru our therapies, those of us in these \u201carctic\u201d climates need to do what we can to keep our poor bald heads warm \u2013 so hats/caps almost seem a necessity.  Although I believe a wig would also be plenty warm and easier to wear during winter than summer.  Babs \u2013 are you as completely wiped out after your first part-time work week as I am?  Good Golly!!  I would have never thought working half-time could tire me out so much!  I\u2019ve spent the weekend trying to rest and still feel terribly fatigued.  I know I have sleep issues because of the tubes but still\u2026..and this week I\u2019m increasing my \u201cin office\u201d hours.  I hope I can manage!  You were pretty wiped out after 3 days, from what I recall, and I\u2019m just curious how you managed the rest of the week.  Are you driving yet?  Feeling more confident you can handle what the road brings your way?  It\u2019s a wonderful feeling having that freedom back but I took my time with it as well.  What I find most difficult (and have had to make adjustments for) is backing up out of a parking spot.  No problem backing out of our garage because I know there are no vehicles sitting in the driveway \u2013 but backing out of a public spot just hurts!  It\u2019s the seatbelt rubbing against my chest while I\u2019m turning my head to look behind me (I never rely on just my mirrors) that is actually painful.  Well, solution \u2013 leave the seatbelt off until I\u2019ve backed up.  Simple enough and then I\u2019m on my way.  If you\u2019ve not yet continued on your driving, I hope you get there soon \u2013 it\u2019s a real confidence booster! Have you gotten any better used to the foobs?  I\u2019m just not able to wear them; it\u2019s too painful against the chest.   I hate this tight/taped up/shrinking feeling at the incision sites on the chest \u2013 it hurts just having a soft cotton flannel resting on my chest.  I had thought it was the sutures when they were not dissolving but they\u2019re all gone now and I still have that terrible feeling.  Do your still have that itchy feeling?  See, I seem to have a diff sensation than that and I wonder why any of us have these weird sensations.  It doesn\u2019t seem like nerve regeneration to me\u2026.but I have no experience in these matters other than what I\u2019m going thru now but have no answers as to why I feel this way.   I just want to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again.  To have the energy I had post op as well as being done with all these strange, odd, sometimes painful sensations that keep popping up making me so uncomfortable!  It almost seems like it will never end\u2026\u2026    Is anyone else feeling that way?   JennH \u2013 how did your first week back to work go?  Did you find you tired very easily as Babs and I did?   Honeybair \u2013 how are things going with you?  I wanted to ask you, where did you purchase your turbans from?  I\u2019ve been to headcoverings.com before and I see you mentioned them but is that where you purchased your turbans?  Did you see PT yet?  I recall you were worried about Lymphedema\u2026.  I also seem to recall you were headed for radiation (is that correct?).  If so, have you had that scheduled yet?  And how is your chest itching issue?  Pam \u2013 I hope you get some good answers from your CT scan this week!  From what I\u2019ve read, generally 4-6 weeks following surgery is when chemo should start.  For me, that\u2019s really pushing it as I\u2019ll be 6 weeks post op this coming Wednesday and just getting in to see my MO for the 1st time tomorrow!  I pray my labs and everything come back fine because I\u2019m tired of waiting and want to get this over and done with.  It\u2019s frustrating and sad that our system is so overloaded w/cancer patients in need of chemo\u2026..but I feel I\u2019ve been plenty patient having had to wait so long just for my 1st MO appt that I hope nothing holds up the start of chemo.  For me, it can\u2019t start soon enough!  Well, ladies\u2026..it appears it will be a busy week for some of us.  Some will be seeing Oncology and getting treatment plans in place, others starting chemo, KBeee going for the shave!!!  (by the way KBeee \u2013 I\u2019d like to see a baldy pic if you\u2019re up for it).  Feel free to include the wonderful guys you work with, I\u2019d love to see that great group of supportive men as well! Keeping all of you in my thoughts and prayers.  May this coming week bring us health and happiness and the fortitude to push forward in our treatments!  Lisa",

The PET Scan is picking something up in the right nodes (this is the side where my sentinel node tested positive but was though to be \"incidental\").  There is definitely something going on there as it lit up quite clearly on the scan.  The problem is this - the PET Scan cannot tell you if it is showing increased cell activity because of cancer or from inflammation.  Because I had a very long recovery, they say it is possible it is still inflamed; however, everyone (Radiologist, Breast Surgeon, Oncologist, and Radiology Oncologist) are in agreement that the PET Scan is concerning. I was sent from the UW Carbone Cancer Center over to another clinic to get an immediate ultrasound - the thought being an ultrasound might give us more info if this was inflammation vs cancer; no such luck - at least not as I sit here right now (the Breast Surgeon and Oncologist were to meet this afternoon to discuss further).  Radiologist was encouraged to see that at least the large node they could get a good pic of shows \"fatty\" type tissue whereas it wouldn't necessarily look that way if it was cancer.  Key word...necessarily.  She simply cannot determine.  After the US was taken she spent quite a bit of time on the phone w/other doctors on my medical team to determine what the best course of action is to be.  From when I left the clinic....we are simply going to move ahead w/chemo and not biopsy this area at this time.  IF it is cancer, chemo will shrink it and I'll have lymph node dissection surgery after my chemo (in 4-5 months).  They will do a follow up ultrasound in 3 months to look at nodes to determine if they shrunk (meaning they ARE cancer) and then surgery to remove OR if they look the same...then we'll know it was just continued inflammation from surgery. OK - EKG also showed concerns (I swear this never ends!).  The normal output for the heart is 50-75%.  Mine is at 50%; therefore it could be very dangerous to use the chemo regimen we had planned for the aggressiveness of my cancer.  I may still be able to if the Cardiologist deems he can have me take sufficient medications to protect my heart from the Adriamycin.  I see the Cardiologist on Wednesday - apparently all decisions regarding how/what chemo will be used will be determined after meeting w/him.  They do have an alternative chemo drug they can use that does not weaken the heart muscle; it's just not as effective as the Adriamycin.  This is how it was put to me:  We don't want to cure you of cancer just to have you die of a heart attack.  Yeah, what can you say to that?  FYI - she also said the 50% could be simply \"my makeup - that's what it's always been and we only know about it now because we checked it prior to starting chemo\".  So this is all very \"up in the air\" to me........I just am following what I'm being directed to do.  I meet w/Oncologist again next Thurs bright and early and will find out how we proceed at that time. So very tiring day and not what I wanted to hear or deal with.  But it is what it is and like it is always said\u2026.one day at a time.  I\u2019ll spend some time this evening catching up on other posts \u2013 I just wanted to let everyone know what happened (and what did not happen) today for me.   Hope everyone is doing well!",

That's the schedule as it stands now - all subject to change.  I'm aware I'm in the 8 week post op period so if MO wants to start chemo on Thurs, I'll start and we'll manage something w/the Friday injections.

She was out of state for a seminar last week when all this transpired; she would have been the first person I turned to after getting all these issues thrown at me and having chemo delayed.  It likely would have saved me all the turmoil I've had over all this.  But such is life..... Having said all that, I still make my own decisions.  She is well aware of my trust issues w/doctors; and she knows I NEED as much medical info as possible in order to make my decisions.  She also understands why I'm easily frustrated w/doctors given the number of years my headaches were mis-diagnosed but she never holds back her opinion and I'm glad she did not in this matter. I'll listen to what Cardiologist has to say and MO after she gets Cardiologists recommendation.  I listen very carefully and if I'm still torn on what to do, I'll turn to my family doctor and tell her why I'm torn.  As always, she'll listen and then give me her advice.  I'll weight that in my decision..... She's already explained she is more worried about my cancer than my heart.  Since I'm far from a medical professional, and I don't have all the reports sitting in front of me (although she will provide them electronically if I ask) she's looking at this medically - wheras I have a lot of emotions tied into it.  She knows that, which is why she is asking me to just listen to what the specialists are telling me and I'm sure she knows me well enough that once I hear, if their advice is to move forward w/AC-T, that I'll weigh everthing w/as little emotion as possible.  I think that was her whole intent; reminding me to take my emotions out of it. ",

I'm actually less worried about chemo than most - it's a journey I must take so I'll take it with a positive attitude. I think attitude has a lot to do with how you tolerate what comes your way but there's no person who can tell a chemo patient \"attitude is everything\" (and people have said that to me). These are harsh chemicals that our bodies don't like and there will be side effects no matter how positive our attitude is. That being said, I also don't fear that all these side effects will happen to me. In fact, I'm wondering if perhaps my headaches will be better (that will really throw a wrench at all the Neurologists who misdiagnosed my headaches for nearly 10 years) and wondering if my psoriasis might lessen or clear. I took Methotrexate years ago (a chemo drug) because it's known to clear psoriasis - and it did. So who knows? I'll take what comes my way and reach out to my doctors to help with anything that is bothersome or worrisome. And, of course, I have you great ladies to come crying to for suggestions and support when I need it along the way. It's that simple. Can you please give me your recipe for baking soda and salt mouthwash? I'd love to have that little trick and use it (I really don't want mouth sores, they sound terrible). Do you know if there is anything to avoid thrush? I don't particularly care for Aquafor - used it in the past for psoriasis and hangnails on my hands at night and it never helped. Do you have something else to suggest? Or is there something I should NOT use? And yes, I do take great comfort in your words, so thank you again! Are you still sleeping well? In bed? I hope so!!!! Jeannine - yesterday morning a nurse called me from BS and said it was indeed THEIR INTENTION TO PUT THE CATHETER UP MY NECK!!!! I never met this nurse and told her I wanted the nurse I sent my message to to call me today - that nurse that called yesterday actually thought she was reassuring me - can you believe that? I got a call for the correct nurse today (the one I've dealt with on everything) and she said to me \"I've never placed a port and catheter so I think it best if you speak w/BS\" and she had him call me a short time later. HE told me that the port will be placed in the upper chest area just below the collar bone. The catheter will be run up to the lowest portion of the neck and inserted into the jugular vein, and then swung over to the heart. I said \"thank you - that eases my mind tremendously\". He said it was unfortunate that all the doctors on my medical team were having many discussions about my surgery but nobody really clued me in to HOW the surgery would be done - and because they snuck me in when they could (for surgery) and know I don't want any more time off work than I've already lost (and will lose recovering from surgery) I never had an appointment to get into see him so he could explain it all to me. I feel so much better now! He apologized that nobody actually went thru the procedure with me and was sorry for any undue stress it put on me. He is really a very nice man - sometimes \"poo poos\" my complaints....but he does listen. I just might not have taken into consideration that when I'm explaining something to him and I'm in pain - my pain tends to rule my head and common sense sometimes gets pushed to the side - something I need to work on. And according to every other doctor on my team, they all tell me how very lucky I am with this BS - he's known as one of the best in this area. And I am thankful (sometimes I don't sound it but I am). Oh, and I'm not worried about the scar. I've got 2 very large slashes across my chest and 2 in the front of each underarm that are clearly visible when I look in the mirror. The port scar is of no concern. At this point, all I say about scarring is \"whatever\". To me they're just battle wounds and my chest will never be some pretty picture so what's one more scar (and a small one at that)? I'd like your magic mouthwash recipe as well - and do you know if there is anything to prevent thrush? If you had it, you'd be the one to know if it can be avoided. But if not, what do you do once you get it to get rid of it? And is that the \"white ick\" I hear women talk about? You hair sounds great! 3 months and 1/2 inch already! I've read women at 7 months post chemo w/hair only at that length so it sounds like you're doing very well in that arena. Yep, your comment about a smile on your face during it all is my aim. I know it will be tough at times and other times may be downright impossible, but it's still my goal. Your story proves to me that it does make it easier so thank you for sharing! I know so little about radiation - I don't know what you mean by \"mapping\" - what's that? I know what mapping is for sentinel node biopsy but have no clue what it has to do with radiation. Thank you as well, Jeannine, for your kind words! Wrenn - as you can see by what I've written, I had no reassurances yesterday. But it came today so....better late than never! At least I now know what to expect. How are you feeling? How is recovery coming along? KBeee - thanks for your reassurance. And I love how you always put it so plainly - one down and one step closer to being done. I only hope I can have that same attitude should I be hit and feel poorly w/SE's! So happy you feel \"normal\" keeping busy w/your organizing the event and not being treated as a \"cancer patient\". I think, when I left work for surgery and only a few people even knew what was going on in my life, I asked one of the owners to mention it at the next employee meeting. I told him \"I don't want to come back after surgery and recovery and have everyone asking me where I was and how I'm doing and on and on\". He did and everyone has respected my privacy on the matter and knew when I returned I just wanted to be the same ole Lisa I always was - didn't want to be \"that cancer patient\" - like you said. So I've been very fortunate in that regard. When is chemo 2? I'm thinking it's this week, isn't it? I have to say, as well, that you are an inspiration to us all. You are so active! And you are not letting anything w/chemo get in your way - I hope to have even a itty bitty likeness to you in that regard after my \"first time\". I've been told to get out and go for a walk even if I'm insanely fatigued because it's been known to make you feel better; but I'm lazy! I know myself and I don't see it happening but when I read how active you have stayed....I'm going to try to push myself and get out for a walk every day. At least the weather has cooled so it will be nice to get out of the house and enjoy the weather before the snow starts flying! You did notice I said \"try\"??....... To Everyone - I swear....you ladies are really so much help and such a comfort to me. I'd be lost without you so thank you to all!!! I feel very fortunate to have had my surgery in August - otherwise I would never have \"met\" any of you (and that would be a shame!). As always, my thoughts are with all of you and will continue to keep each one of you in my prayers.",

I wish so badly you could heal, Wrenn.  I cannot imagine having to deal with all that, day after day, for so long.  It doesn't seem fair and I know I can say that because I think you've probably said it to yourself over these last months...perhaps many times, right?  Do you have access to any complimentary care there in Canada?  Like massage or acupuncture?  Maybe getting weekly massages could help your body relax and speed up healing?  I got temp relief from headaches w/acupuncture and know many people who have been helped by it, is that something you might consider if it is available?  You know, when a person is sick...it seems everyone around them becomes a \"doctor\" and has something they want you to use because they \"know\" it will help you feel better.  I prefaced that with this info....my sister-in-law gave me a bottle of Silver Hydrosol and says she uses it on everything.  I took it to my MO visit the day of chemo and asked if it was OK to use and MO looked at ingredients and said it was perfectly fine.  I was told to use it on any cuts I might get; that it makes the healing much, much faster (don't ask me how...but MO seemed fine with it so I'm going on the theory that Silver does in fact assist in healing) and I wondered if it might be something you could use.  Of course, if you are still draining it might not be a good idea as you need to keep the wound open but perhaps once it starts to close you could get some benefit from this.  I think she purchases this at Vitacost....and if so, then I believe it would probably be available in any health food/supplement store you have in the area.  I feel so bad for you.  I know you have many here praying for you; I just wish things would speed up.  Once that darn wound heals I'm thinking your attitude will change and become much more positive.  Know that I keep you in my prayers daily!",

I've had to do a lot of soul searching...my mind still feels so foggy and unable to function.  After discussions w/husband, daughter and PCP I think I'm going to see if I can get on disability.  I missed 6 days of work after just one treatment and although I know there is no rhyme or reason to how each separate chemo affects a patient, I fear that the \"chemo brain\" I experienced is something I am likely to experience w/future therapies.  It is not fair to my employer to have me only be able to work 3 - 4 days every 2 weeks nor do I want to continue feeling guilty about calling in sick because I don't feel comfortable working w/the companies financial data.  It embarrasses me that I don't feel I can work, it certainly is not something I expected or wanted, but the facts need to be faced and decisions made.  Like my husband said \"you need to stop worrying about anything except yourself - you need to focus on \"you\" and obviously chemo is going to be more difficult than you thought so let go of all the external things causing you stress and let's look into getting you on disability thru this period\" - and he's right.  It's just not what a want and was not willing to face...",

Yes, it is OK to remove your surgical garments, dressings, etc and let water run over all the areas.  Here is what might help in \"washing\" the surgical sites (I give this advise because there was just no way I could see touching the areas with a soapy washcloth due to pain):  I took a new spray bottle, I squeezed in some liquid Aveeno daily wash \"soap\", then added some warm water.  I made sure the spray was on a mist setting - I think a stream would hurt - then when showering I simply sprayed all the areas where there were incisions to make sure they got cleansed.  I had a home health nurse visit me 2 days after leaving the hospital and we had to ask her about showering instructions because the nurses never told me anything.  She said it is important to NOT use fragranced soap (I was lucky because I already had Aveeno daily body wash and she said that was perfect).  I had to have my husband assist with the shower, I could not move my arms enough to wash my back and there was no way I could raise them to wash my hair.  Let your sweetheart help - any offer of help you get you should take; don't hesitate for a minute.  You've been thru a major surgery and it's very hard on the body.  Some of us have more problems with it than others so be assured you are not alone.  How are you set to hold your drains while you shower?  Do you have a belt or a lanyard?  You need something and there are lots of good suggestions like making a belt of saran wrap and slipping your drains on that and then tying the saran wrap.  Personally, I used a soft string around my neck, slipped the drains on those and tied it closed - but very uncomfortable.  Each has their own preference so look at the postings to find what might suit you best.  Oh, and rinsing the areas where you have incisions - don't let the shower water hit them directly!  Stand with your back to the spray and let it hit your neck area.  Stand there for a minute or 2 and as the water runs down your front you'll rinse off just fine without having the shower stream hit your incisions directly. It sounds like you had immediate reconstruction since you made calls to PS - what did you have?  And the tube thing - they hurt!  I still have 2 and the discomfort gets worse the longer they are in.  Since I have an inbred fear of looking at any incision on anybody (hence the reason I've not looked at incisions on my chest) - I just get sick to my stomach when I see stitches-always have and likely always will - anyway....I had to finally look at the area where the tubes were sewn into my sides because they were hurting SO much.  I found that they had long tails off the knot which was catching on all my clothing and constantly being pulled, and friction was making them so insanely irritated.  So have you looked at that?  Or had your sweetheart look?  Might be the same issue and I can tell you when I cut those long tails off, all the catching on clothing stopped and felt so much better. Please know you are not alone (I was beginning to feel I was until I read your post!).  It gets better with time, it's just hard to keep that in mind in the beginning when everything hurts so bad.  And you will feel better once you shower - have a chair or something in the bathroom or in a room nearby and let your chest/armpits/sides air dry (don't bother patting them dry if you hurt).  It only takes about 10 minutes and then you don't have to touch. I can tell you all my pain was explained right away when the doctors and residents came to check on me the first morning after surgery as being caused by the reconstruction.  After being in so much really bad pain for 5 days I was extremely upset and started worrying I made the wrong decision regarding immediate reconstruction (nobody told me the pain that would be involved and all the pain meds they gave me just didn't seem to bring the pain below an 8 - that wears on a person!).  But it gets better - keep that foremost in your mind. I'll watch you progress.  We're all in this together and I've found BCO discussion boards such a wealth of information and the support and caring and encouragement are unbelievable! Wishing you well!!",

Nobody said anything to me about arm movement.  I moved it as much as I could when I could.  Took several days before I could even hold a mug of coffee but I never intentionally tried to keep my arm(s) still.  I worried about lymphedema and then developed fluid buildup beneath the left node incision.  I was told to use my arm as much as possible - it would help get that fluid moving and there was no reason NOT to move the arm.  I've read a lot online about people saying \"keep as still as possible so your fluid output decreases so the tubes can be removed\" - I didn't like the sounds of that.  Do that, get the tubes removed, start using your arms a lot, and then fluid output could increase and before you know it, an infection could be right around the corner - NOT GOOD.  But I can't say I read anywhere online or in Dr Love's book that you should not use your arm - in fact, her book talked about the issue of getting Frozen Shoulder if you do that and then you have a whole nother problem on your hands that can take a long time to resolve.  Can anyone think of some way we, as BC patients, might get something together to get our voices heard on doctors and nurses informing us better?  I'm actually disgusted with the lack of info I got and downright mad about getting poo-poo'd on some of the questions I did ask.  Like I was asking something that I shouldn't worry about yet my questions came from reading Dr Love's book before surgery and doing research online.  Know the response I got from every doctor???  \"You shouln't go online to research or read about these things, all it does is worry people and you have to understand that the people who post comments online are usually just the ones who had bad experiences\".  I'm not kidding!  I told them all that it's my right to KNOW what is happening, what to expect, and to ask questions if I have them - but they just blow over the issues.  I had/have a great team, don't get me wrong, but the medical profession needs to get it thru their heads that we live in an age where we can be more informed than ever before and \"informed consent\" means something!!!!  Any suggestions? ",

JennH8 - Strange to see your posting asking about how we are dealing emotionally.  Today is actually the first day I got so frustrated, emotionally drained, physically tired, and really just downright pissy that led to a good old-fashioned cry.  I\u2019ve been good til this morning.  But I\u2019m fed up and my medical team keeps telling me to be patient and I want to scream at them I\u2019ve been patient enough already!  I can\u2019t believe it takes so long \u2013 and this is just the beginning!  It all just overwhelmed me.  I felt terrible when my husband (who has been such an angel thru this whole experience!) came home from work and I just unloaded on him.  Started to cry and then told him how sorry I was for him to have to come home to such a basket-case.  He just looked at me and said \u201cyou have a right with what you\u2019ve been thru\u201d (God, I love that man!).   KBeee \u2013 I\u2019m so glad you clarified for everyone what you meant with your original post and that everyone was able to respond.  Hope everything goes well tomorrow when they remove your tubes!  And please, don\u2019t scratch those things out tonight!!!!!!!! Jtrosesav \u2013 you are so on track with my thinking today it\u2019s a little freaky!  Your comment about having a BMX and still not believing you are a cancer patient \u2013 that is so what I have been feeling the last couple days!  I\u2019m kind of like you \u2013 I worry about all thing medical whenever I\u2019ve had a surgery\u2026\u2026probably too much but I can\u2019t help it.  I\u2019ve done pretty well when my husbands been working but then any \u201cissue\u201d that has arisen has done so either in the evening or weekend so he\u2019s here to see me thru it.  And I hope very much you get news tomorrow that is nothing but good!!!!  You\u2019re in my thoughts and prayers \u2013 be sure to let us all know what you find out. ndgrrl \u2013 Welcome!  Glad you found us!  Your description of how your arm feels sound like how I felt for first couple weeks after surgery and sentinal node biopsy.  Told it was normal and would get better \u2013 and it has gotten much better even in just 2 weeks.  But if it concerns you, check with your doctor (and I don\u2019t think you should be stretching and reaching up for things \u2013 can someone perhaps get those things down on a counter for you?).  If it gets worse, call your doctor.  I don\u2019t know anything about the procedures you spoke of \u2013 hopefully others will see your post and can respond.  Everyone has their chemo tailored to their individual case; don\u2019t worry.  We\u2019re all here for you but it\u2019s normal to be scared.   aviva5675 \u2013 you\u2019re a brave soul out there driving.  I still can\u2019t even get a darn safety cap off a medicine bottle much less attempting to control a 2 ton vehicle!  Did you get a shave? Hope you all had a better day than I.  Guess it\u2019s normal; I\u2019m so glad to have you all to help me thru and who understand exactly what it\u2019s like to go thru this experience Wishing you all a good night!  I\u2019ll keep you all in my prayers!",

\u2013 I was going to my family doctor and I\u2019d have them snipped there.  I received response \u201cwe know your frustrated but it\u2019s not uncommon at this point after the surgeries you\u2019ve had\u201d, blah, blah.  Well, at least we\u2019re going to start the fill process, the sutures will be snipped, and if by some fluke my fluid decreases today thru Friday, perhaps I can get the drains removed as well.  I want to make sure any newbies jumping in here knows not to think there is a set normal time-frame for drains.  Some are lucky and have them removed shortly after surgery but there are also plenty of women on BCO that have been/are in the same boat I\u2019m in w/drains still 30 days after surgery.  I\u2019ve read other threads of women having them until 8-9 weeks post surgery (good God I hope I\u2019m not one of them!)  I worry about that first driving experience.  It would be different if we still had a car like the Bonneville we had years ago that handled like a dream; I drive an SUV now and it is far from \u201csmooth\u201d and does not steer anywhere as easily as the Bonneville did so I\u2019m making sure I am completely confident I can handle anything that might come my way on the road before getting behind the wheel (worry most about deer jumping out in the road and how well I could safely keep vehicle under control so as not to put any other vehicle on the road in danger).  We have many deer in our area year-round\u2026..so I know that\u2019s usually the biggest danger and I could never live with myself if I got behind the wheel too soon and caused an accident that hurt any other innocent person.  I\u2019d like to have that little independence back but not at the risk of hurting anyone in the process \u2013 just my fear.  KBeee \u2013 you crack me up, you do watch that clock very closely, don\u2019t you!  How did you do last night?  Hope you didn\u2019t scratch the drains out\u2026..   I\u2019m shocked that you will likely be at your pre BMX size so soon!  I was not well-endowed either and PS explained to me that is why I\u2019ve had so much pain from surgery and have not had an easy time of it all around.  Strange how all PS\u2019s are different \u2013 and I guess it just goes to show how different we all are and have such different experiences from our surgeries.  Good luck with your wig shopping today!   AnnFM \u2013 from your post, are you opting for the scarf/hat/caps vs wigs?  I\u2019ve been watching what other women decide and what made them come to their decision.  I\u2019m pretty certain that I\u2019m not going the wig route myself; not that I have a problem with anyone who chooses a wig as we all  have to choose what is best for us, but I\u2019m feeling if I have no hair after chemo starts, I don\u2019t want to take care of hair.  Also think there are so many cute scarves and hats.  I\u2019m actually a \u201cwall-flower\u201d and hate drawing any attention to myself so I\u2019m really surprised with my decision.  Perhaps it\u2019s my fear of what a fool I\u2019d look like if my wig got crooked and nobody told me and I went thru my day without a clue \u2013 you know, like if you find out you have a little something there in your nose and nobody said a thing\u2026\u2026.   wrenn \u2013 I have that same tight feeling in my chest.  I\u2019d explain it more like someone taped very strong heat-shrink tape across mey chest and it\u2019s been slowly shrinking as each day goes by.  I\u2019m grouchy myself (pissy really!) and feel like clawing at my chest!  I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s these darn sutures and once they snip them it will feel better.  I guess I\u2019ll find out of Friday.  All the comments on the numbness \u2013 I\u2019ve read quite a bit that it is normal when any nodes are removed for this to happen.  I had electrical type shocks shooting from the incision down on the inside of the arm to the elbow area start very shortly after surgery and also developed seroma on that same side.  I used both my arms as much as I could as soon as I could for fear of developing Frozen Shoulder (read about in Dr Love\u2019s Breast Book).  Other threads I\u2019ve been at about this issue had women assure me it was likely nerve damage and it would get better with time; and it has.  But it also is not uncommon for it to take a much, much longer time before the numbness goes away and it may never go away (so be sure you read about the dangers of shaving with a blade!).  My BS actually gave me Dr Love\u2019s book when I had my first appt \u2013 anyone interested in reading all about this new world we find ourselves in, here is the link to her website:  www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/  Very useful information!!  Hoping everyone has a great day!  Mine started on a bad note \u2013 cat jumped on my chest while I was in bed sleeping (been up since 3:30 so I\u2019ve had time to post)\u2026\u2026..but brushed it off and determined to have a better day than yesterday.",

I've been away from posting a bit this past week due to extreme fatigue but I've tried to keep up on the new posts (and to check the progress of both KBeee and Babs hospital admissions) but I don't think I saw a post of how your appointment went. Are you doing OK and are you still going to go ahead with chemo, again - forgive my memory but I think I recall you said end of this month, as planned? You, too, have had such a long recovery with so many different complications thrown in the mix, that I worry how you are coping.",

I'm glad you also will be returning to work part-time.  It feels good, getting back a little of our independence even if on a limited basis.  Seems a lot of us are crossing some of the barriers at the same time (except me and my stupid drains......) which I guess means we'll likely not be able to post as often as we had been.  Work takes up our time, then we have our families, so we can only do what we can do in a day and we all need to keep close track of how our bodies are reacting to more activity so as not to overdue it which will probably mean making time for resting/napping.  I found I felt great when I went into work 3 hours last Saturday - but I paid for it that evening and all day Sunday.  It obviously took more out of me than what I felt as I was working so I know that's something I myself will have to watch this next week. Oh well, what is one going to do but push forward while balancing how our bodies are handling it. So your breasts are sitting higher as well.  See, in my mind this is my thinking.  If the expansion is being done higher than where our breast orginally fell, then how is the pec muscle being stretched lower down for the final implant to have the ability to fall and spread?  That's what keeps going thru my head but as I've said before, this is all so new to me and info on the internet can be so conflicting I try not to read too much and rely on my medical team for that, but it doesn't make sense to me.  I guess, here again, we'll all likely be having our final implant surgeries around the same time (if chemo doesn't delay it for some reason in any of us) so we'll all be comparing notes on how the final product looks. Will you be wearing a bra or cami when you return to work?  If I recall, you had quite a bit of expansion at the time of your surgery so you've got breasts already (while I have \"swelling\" - no way you can call what I currently have \"breasts\") - I guess with you my question would be if you can wear a regular bra and if you can, will you? I'm just curious what other women are planning to do....I hate the feel of the prosthses so I may just go back to work being incredibly flat.  I just don't know but need to decide in the next day. Chat with you soon!",

Thanksgiving here is going to be very unconventional.  I simply have no appetite for the week after chemo and for some reason I'm dealing with much more nausea than my past 2 treatments - could be the Gingeng they told me to take (I'll have to look into that).  Anyway, no big Turkey dinner for us!  I won't have the energy to cook, DH does not cook, and some friends were trying to cater in a dinner for us but my DH stopped them letting them know it would be wasteful since I'm not up to eating with as poorly as I feel.  So we opted to do hor d'vouers this year.  Yep, all those little munchies we have before dinner that seem to be made only at the holidays - that will be our Thanksgiving \"meal\".  Decided on twice baked potatoes, spinach dip w/marble rye, veggies and dill dip, and quacomole and chips and apple pie.  I can see plenty of calories in most all the items and that's what I'm after - AND....DH can prepare all the fixings!  What a deal (of course I'll help; he's never made any of these things in his life but we'll manage thru it).  Our daughter cannot get home for the holiday and I don't want any friends or extended family around when I feel so poorly - I get cranky so I prefer to just be around my DH.  So....a big change from any other Thanksgiving, but this year brought many big changes that just need to be dealt with as best as possible.  Moving onto Taxol on Dec 19th and hoping I tolerate that much better than A/C.  If so, we will do our annual big Thanksgiving/Christmas Turkey dinner with all the fixings then.  We will have to wait and see.....but I'm hoping it works out that way. Hoping each and every one of you (and those of you out there reading but not always being able to post) have a very Blessed and Happy Thanksgiving holiday.  We all made it this far so we have much to be thankful for this year.  I, for one, count all of you among my blessings for without you, I would have been lost. Happy Thanksgiving!!!! Lisa",

How's your tomato situation?  You can look at it this way - at least you have something to take up your time! Wrenn - so your date is set - given what is about to begin the time will probably fly by.  Besides Blood Builder, have you asked the nurse what else you could do to bring up your hemoglobin?  There has to be some nutritional guidelines to assist with that and I'd be interested to know if you were told anything.  I've read a little about the most common chemo drugs used for TNBC and I have to admit, it all sounds scary.  I'm having a bad day (not being able to sleep well for 5 weeks wears on a person, right?) so I've stayed away from doing any work as I'm hardly sharp of mind today.  So I've had a little time to look things up.  I've kept away from doing so until now...but since MO appt is right around the corner I've got a million questions running thru my head and my husbands asking questions so....figured I'd just look up a little info to perhaps help me formulate my questions for MO.  Quite frankly, it's raised a lot of issues and perhaps I should have continued to stay away from Mr Google.  Well, hindsight...right?  I looked, I saw, I read, and now I have added worry (stupid of me!).  I'll blame it on lack of sleep!!!! I'm staying away from any more looking.  Oncology can tell me what will be used for my situation and I'll be burning up the internet afterward.  Instead of reading all sorts of stuff that may not even apply to me. Ladies who have had chemo - might any of you be able to address the fatigue issue?  Are there any specific foods you were told to eat?  Any supplements that are safe during chemo to ward off exhaustion?  Right now it's my biggest concern so I thought I'd check with you to see if you've got any info that might be helpful.  And on a more personal note, I also read something about refraining from intercourse at times during chemo (something about fluid transfer).  I've never heard of that and I found it surprising - can anyone address that (if it doesn't make you too uncomforable to do so)?  Oh, I was supposed to get another expansion today but whoever my PS had call me on Monday to schedule never put my appt down - so no expansion.  So much for trying more to decrease fluid output - I'd like to strap these drains and sew in a couple tubes on the gal who called me and then didn't bother to put me on the schedule! (I know, that's not very nice.  Again, I blame lack of sleep - which of course is due to these tubes and drains and having to sleep on my back).  So I wait another week for expansion, with fluid levels still the same as always with no hope in sight.  There has to be a time limit on these things......",

I'm glad you're doing your therapy 3x a day as instructed, even though it sounds very difficult.  But no one said this journey we've all been thrown on was going to be easy and each of us has our own individual hardships.  Yours sounds painful and I'm glad you asked for something to help with pain.  Sleep is so important for healing; it's when our bodies heal so if you're not sleeping I'm glad you asked your doctor for something to help the pain so you can rest.  And to answer your question - yes, I do still have my 2 drains.  My fuild levels were below what is required yesterday, but I'm not going to get excited that I may have turned a corner.  This has happened before but then the levels increase w/in the next day or 2.  As much as I want these out, I don't want to take any chances until we're certain the output has slowed completey.  If they come out too soon, and I end up with an infection because of seroma and they need to be removed - then I'm done w/reconstruction.  This has caused too much of a disruption in my life that I had no clue could happen when I agreed the the procedure...but I've learned more of all the \"bad\" things that can happen so if the TE's need to be removed for any reason...I'm just done.  Update on Silicone \"Increasers\" - to all other ladies with that \"itching\" or pain w/pressure against chest - I simply cannot wear the fiberfill prosthesis I was provided due to the pain it causes w/so much pressure right up on my chest.  So I tried the silicone \"increasers\" that Babs posted about and I have to say they are MUCH more comfortable.  I was told I wasn't supposed to wear a bra until 10 days post tube/drain removal so I purchased tube tops with pocket inserts (Amazon - 2 for about $12.00) and put the increasers (again, Amazon for $18.00) in the pockets.  So much more comfortable!  Not entirely w/o discomfort...but much, much more bearable than the fiberfill prosthesis.  Not as much of a \"bump\" for the boob look; but I personally, at this point, don't care.  Comfort is my main goal and this solved the issue.  Gives a little illusion of breasts and is comfortable enough to get thru the day. I don't know if any of you have researched this itchy/pain thing that seems to be happening to some of us.  I accidentally stumbled across it (while looking for any info I could find on excessive drainage) - it may be an actual known syndrome - it's call Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome.  Any of you with these issues may want to google it to read about it and ask your physician if you feel it might be something that is happening to you.  I was surprised to find it, a bit relieved to see what we are feeling might be something that happened to enough women before us that studies have been done and it is a recognized medical condition.  Hoping everybody has a great Saturday (sunny and pleasantly mild temps here in WI, finally after too many 90 degree days w/high humidity!).  Hope you all have sunshine in your lives!",

I had a terrible time with chemo after Thanksgiving; developed a lot of bad side effects and just needed to hide inside myself to find the courage to get thru.  Although I had to skip one treatment due to the severity of the hand-foot syndrome (my skin on fingers/feet &toes like blistered up, then turned into gross looking pus-filled calluses(but they were not pus filled), then peeled.....then about a week later it would all start over again....we reduced the dose of Taxol by 20% and that eased up the problem by time I finally finished chemo in February), I finished1 week beyond my scheduled finish time.  This constant blistering and peeling was terribly painful - especially on the fingertips and typing was very difficult.  It was all I could do to get thru the work day.  I still have neuropathy in the left foot pad....I doubt that will ever go away. Tried treating it with Lyrica for many months but finally weaned off it as it just was not helping. I had also developed another lump under the right armpit.  Had a US and they said it was a seroma - STILL even after 6 months post surgery I have this seroma.  However, this caused more concern in recent weeks. I had my 1 month post chemo checkup; labs and CT Scan.  They found a spot on my lung; as I was to find out a week later when I requested the original PET Scan report from Sept 2013,this spot was also seen then but was thought to be scar tissue.  When I saw my Oncologist at 1 month post chemo visit, she said they were now saying it appeared to them to be early slow growing cancer.  I had smoked for years and so this was terrifying news and everyone on my cancer team (which has grown to the point where I almost can't remember everybody anymore) was very, very worried about this. I had 2 choices; look into it further or wait 3 months and have the CT repeated and see what comes up.  As I'm sure you know, lung cancer often times is a death sentence - but I still originally opted to wait. But then after reading my original PET Scan report and meeting with my family doc, I went to Pulmonary Specialists and they highly recommended surgery - said the spot was too large to just \"wait and see\" in their opinion and so then a flurry of tests were done because surgery could cause problems with the heart which may have been compromised by the AC treatment.  Had repeat EKG, Stress Test,PET Scan and I can't even remember what else, and made the decision to have surgery to remove the spot.  Biopsy was not an option; they said they were not comfortable they could get an accurate reading as this area of concern was buried in the lung.  As you know, I can fall apart pretty easy and was put on several anti-anxiety meds to get me thru to get this surgery done which I really didn't want to have done but everyone was telling me I needed to AND knowing if I gambled and waited 3 months, I could end up with that death sentence. The PET Scan was done again at my request because of my reading the original report.  I was pissed beyond words to find out the report showed there were 4 nodes that looked to be cancerous and they only told me about 1 - which, you may recall, I had removed in October.  So now I had the added worry that there were possibly 3 more nodes in my armpit spreading cancer thru my lungs and body and I was never told about it.  Met w/my family doctor; she contacted my Oncologist and we all agreed it best to have the PET Scan done again to get a clearer picture of these nodes asap (oh, the original report also said the right underarm should be scanned again in 3 months - which was never done - that should have been done in January and it was now March).  What a mess! As it all ended up, the nodes are still somewhat suspicious\u2026.but they also appear similar to the wall surrounding the seroma and after a very clear and thorough explanation from my MO, I feel comfortable with their recommendation to follow this area up every 3months. MO does NOT want the seroma aspirated; said she doesn\u2019t want any more needles going into me as necessary (really?after all the tests and now surgeries and shots I\u2019ve been thru I\u2019d think a needle aspiration would really be something to NOT worry about-but what do I know?) I just had lung surgery the past Thursday, April 10th.  They cut off the top portion of my right lung.  Initial pathology done during surgery did not indicate cancer so they did not need to remove the lobe or worse yet, the entire lung.  So now I wait for final pathology.  If it is cancer, that's all I needed to do - no chemo, no radiation, no nothing.  Remove it and it's gone. But my Thoracic Surgeon said my lungs look very healthy and he expects that the pathology will either be cancer free or may show just minute amounts of cancer cells. It's been a rough 8 months....I held up well until Thanksgiving and then when I started with all the side effects on top of the normal fatigue and losing weight...it was just too much.  Then made it thru chemo, felt great to know it was behind me and then got slapped down with the whole lung cancer scare.  So now as I recover at home, my head has again cleared and feel I can/will just move forward and God willing, have my reconstruction surgery scheduled for May 19th and then hope never to see another surgeon again in my life!  I'm damn tired of being cut into, dissected, run thru every flipping test you can imagine and ..... well, I'm just done. So please, I\u2019d love to hear how all you are doing.Looks like a couple reconstruction exchanges are done (congrats ladies!) and I\u2019d love to know if your implants are still larger than you expected.I can\u2019t remember who mentioned the \u201cteardrop\u201d\u2013 but I guess I assumed that the PS would take our ages into consideration and use those types of shapes. Of course,now that time has passed you might now have that look \u2013 let me know as I\u2019m nervous about having high, round breasts that just don\u2019t sound right on a 50year old woman (at least they\u2019ll get these TE\u2019s out of my armpit!)  I hope all is well in your livesand that everyone enjoys a healthy, happy Easter.  Lili",

Babs - WOW - you are an amibtious one!  Yes - my drainage is still down on one side; 2 days at 20ml and today looks like it will be the same.  However, the other side was 20ml 2days ago then jumped to 35ml yesterday.  Looks like today will be a replay of yesterday so I don't think that one is ready yet.  I'll give it one more day and see if side 1 stays under 30 and perhaps the other will decrease again and then perhaps buzz into PS on Tues to have both removed.  But I've been here before.....and like I said, when I have a couple good days it suddenly jumps for no reason.  So although I'm optimistic (yeah, I sound real optimistic, don't I?) my track record tells me things can change overnight.   I did the whole shoulder strap behind me for 3 weeks after surgery when my husband was chauffering me to all my appointments and it certainly helped.  I'm just not comfortable driving like that.  And the shoulder strap only hurts when I turn my head (and with it my body twists) so I keep it off completely when I back up.  Other than that I'm fine with the seatbelt in place where it's meant to be - no problems since it rides between my breasts (well, where they used to be). So sorry your daughter is going back to Europe.  That has to be hard!  I hope she is able to come back in December.  So how far out on LI are you?  My husband was born and raised in Bellmore.  LI is busy, busy, busy!  We visited by car about 24 years ago and thought the traffic was bad then.  We took a mini-vacation to visit an old friend in Manhattan in April of this year - our friend also has a place out of Fire Island that we went to visit for the day and I couldn't believe how much MORE busy LI has gotten - Oh My!  I don't know how you folks drive in that!  It's insane!!! My head was spinning - I'm not kidding!!!! Pam - you described your fear very well.  My husbands a 29 year member of the military and I understand completely what that fear is that you described.  That has to be horrible.  So here's the advice we all heard before....try to think of pleasant thoughts and try not to worry.  I know, we've all done that and some of us better than others.  But your fear sounds very deep and that can't be good for you.  Instead, enjoy that shopping!  And enjoy your family from Norway and Thursday will be here before you know it!  Nothing you or anyone else can do or say that will change those results - they are what they are so please don't worry or be in fear of what they show.  You'll find out soon enough and you may just be worrying yourself for no reason - please, ignore everything about it and enjoy life this week.  Just concentrate and follow thru on \"I'm just going to enjoy life\" - then go to your appt at it's scheduled time with a smile on your face.  This waiting we've all endured can be hard unless YOU decide you're not going to let it be so.  Really, just throw all responsibility (within reason...) to the wind and do everything YOU want to do for the next 4 days - and enjoy!  You earned it!  And I doubt anyone would begrudge you to do what you want and what makes you happy - so take advantage of it (not too often we get this carte blanche but enduring the surgeries we have after the diagnosis' (I'm not sure you you spell that, sorry)we've received - I am a firm believer that each and every one of us HAS earned it and should use it as needed to get us thru the waiting that seems to never end.  It's all frame of mind - that's what it's all about and will see you thru.",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2014 08:08AM - edited Apr 22, 2014 09:42AM by LiLi1964 Vintagegal \u2013 so glad things were kept on schedule for you and you continue to move forward. I guess I never looked at your stats before \u2013 for some reason I was under the impression you had your surgery last year. Sorry you had an extra \u201cboob\u201d pop up after surgery\u2026..the surgery itself is harrowing enough without having complications thrown into the mix! Looks like you started Rads yesterday \u2013 how did that all go? My chemo issues were with both AC \u2013 cumulative as they all started 1 week after my last AC treatment, and Taxol. Taxol made them worse which is why the Taxol dose needed to be reduced by 20%. There were good days and bad; unfortunately for some of us there were more bad days than good. Reconstruction is a very personal decision and you obviously have thought it through and decided what is best for you at the moment. As long as you are comfortable with your decision, that is all that matters. Wrenn \u2013 glad to hear from you! I was unclear what you meant about what they said about your neuropathy \u2013 can you explain that again? I know when I started Taxol I had read neuropathy could be permanent \u2013 which my MO confirmed when I asked. I still have it in my left foot\u2026.it may go away it may not. I guess where I\u2019m at right now, that\u2019s of little concern. My hair actually started to grow back once I started the Taxol treatments. It\u2019s still only about ½\u201d long and is growing really funky! On the left side of my head, the hair is growing from back to front\u2026.like some old guy might look with a comb-over! And with it being so short, if I try to comb or use hair clay to kind of spike it or get it to go towards the back of my head, it just sticks straight out! Real attractive\u2026\u2026. I just want a little more length so I can ditch the wig. With summer right around the corner, a wig is going to be too uncomfortable! Babs \u2013 so sorry to hear of all your problems with that darn side. I know that all started back around the Thanksgiving time-frame; you sure are a determined woman to keep going back for further remedies! I probably would have given up but I was never \u201chell-bent\u201d on my reconstruction. I did it for the simple reason that I didn\u2019t want to bother with prosthetics while still in the work-force. Once the implants have had their \u201cshelf-life\u201d and need to be removed, I will not be having them replaced. You have to be tired of being in hospitals! Hope your PS has some other options for you to look at this week. I hope your daughter was able to get back state-side to spend some time with you for the holidays! Pam \u2013 let me ask you\u2026.did your nails all get ridges and turn brownish? That\u2019s what mine did and they look disgusting! When I look at them now, about half way down they all look normal so the part of the nail that was damaged from the Taxol should be grown out in about 1-2 months. I actually wear nail-polish (which I am not one to normally use) because the damaged part just looks so terrible! Looks like you\u2019re almost done with rads \u2013 congrats! Jo \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your friend. My deepest sympathy to you on your loss. I\u2019ll say a prayer in hopes your mammo comes back normal. KBee \u2013 I think of you everyday at work\u2026the card you had sent with the headband is pinned to my bulletin board and I see it everyday (a lot of 4 letter words went thru my head during treatment!). Such a cute card I had to pin it there as a reminder of my fellow BC Aug Surgeries friends\u2026. I\u2019m glad you like your foobs and your nipple reconstruction went well. I\u2019ve read that many women find the new \u201cnipple\u201d shrinks quite a bit over time and it almost ends up looking non-existent. Mind you, I didn\u2019t read a lot on the subject because I had decided after reading how it was done that I was not going to proceed with that so I may have been looking at old data; what\u2019s important is that you are happy with what you have! How long did your healing take after the exchange? Ndgrrl \u2013 I\u2019m so happy your genetic testing came back looking so well!!!! That is such a relief. It is upsetting enough that we are dealing with all this; it is gut-wrenching to think our children might also if we carry the genetic make-up that would be passed on to them. Aviva \u2013 so I take it then that your initial impression that the implants looked too large were not a result of swelling? That you are going in to have the implants exchanged for a smaller implant? How long did your healing take after the exchange? OK \u2013 I got my pathology results back late Friday afternoon. It is lung cancer. It is not a spread of breast cancer, but a new primary cancer. Surgery removed it and it is my understanding that is all that will be done. However, since getting the results I\u2019ve been doing some reading and what they didn\u2019t tell me was about survival rates and lung cancer. They got this last cancer out but the prognosis doesn\u2019t look very hopeful\u2026.. I have a ton of questions and assumed I\u2019d be followed up with this new cancer with my MO but apparently here at the UW, the Thoracic Surgeon follows lung cancer patients (unless it is more advanced, then the MO might get involved). Mine was caught very early and only because I had the chest CAT Scan done as post-chemo follow-up. Mine is a Stage 0 which is almost unheard of since this cancer has few side effects and what side effects it has, can be related to so many other medical issues. I have my post-op visit w/Thoracic Surgeon late this afternoon \u2013 I\u2019ve read lung cancer (I have Adenocarcinoma in situ) has very high recurrence rates and a high rate of second primary cancers. I\u2019ve already had 2 primary cancer diagnoses in less than a year\u2026.I pray to God I don\u2019t get another. I\u2019m feeling very discouraged from what I\u2019m reading so he will either confirm what I\u2019ve read or be able to offer me some hope. It appears from what I read that if I make it to the 5 year mark without a recurrence, my odds then are very good for continuing on cancer-free. However, they also saw a very small nodule on the right lung from the CAT Scan so that is my biggest fear right now\u2026.that that nodule might turn cancerous.  When they removed the top portion of the right lung, they also removed one lymph node from the middle of my chest - that came back negative (good news!) Well, I\u2019ve been dealt a bad hand here but somehow need to find the frame of mind to not worry about recurrence (I\u2019ve no clue how I\u2019m going to do that but know I must find a way). I have many things in my favor but have some thing working against me as well\u2026..I\u2019ll just have to wait and see what Thoracic has to say later today. Hope everyone else is doing well. I\u2019m glad we got a little interest going again in this forum and we\u2019ve all been able to reconnect. Take care, all! Wishing each of you health and happiness! Lisa",

I worked 1/2 days for 2 weeks; returned to work full-time today.  And I'll second the use of sleeping pills when nothing else works. Last Monday, I finally asked my doctor for something.  I hadn't been getting more than 4 hours of sleep a night (if I was lucky) for 5 weeks post op.  Then that first week back to work even at 1/2 time completely wiped me out; but still could not sleep more than 4 hours.  Took the sleeping pills but first night it did nothing.  Next 2 nights, took them and that's all I needed.  Got 8-9 hours of sleep each night and sleeping regularly (ie pre surgery) again.  So when needed, and if anyone goes 5 weeks w/only 4 hours of sleep a night knows, it's needed.  As I've said before, we can't heal if our bodies are not resting properly.  Just those 3 nights of taking something for sleep and I feel SO much better all around it's imposible to quantify. Jo6202 - posture matters, I found out, too.  I was hunching inward because of the chest feeling so strange and tight.  I had to keep making myself aware of what I was doing and correct it immediately.  Not always easy but in the long run makes a person feel much better.  I hope your back-ache gets better soon. Poodle-mum - sorry to hear of your continued issues w/recovery.  It has to get better soon; it just has to! OK, everyone....I'm getting a bit anxious for chemo in 3 days.  I'm really nervous!  I keep telling myself the advise I gave others \"we're on a search and destroy mission to kill any remaining cancer\" - I keep telling myself that but anxiety is still building.  I have my PET Scan in the morning and EKG tomorrow afternoon.  I hope both come back well; honestly I'm not even concerned because my anxiety over the start of chemo overtakes all.  I hate this journey!  I have a little more info on the Port in the arm and the PICC line.  The port in the arm IS a PICC line.  My MO nurse called me today and I asked about the PICC line and she said that is what others sometimes call an arm port.  Apparently they don't offer it because most women simply do not want the trouble that comes with it.  Problem (for me, anyway) is a PICC line needs daily maintenance.  Either myself or a family member needs to flush it daily (I can't do that) AND it is partially external (that would be a pain, literally).  So, should my veins give me problems.....I'll just do the darn port in the chest.  There are never simple answers to any of this, is there?  Just one more incision...... I'll continue to post on this thread.  I've posted occassionally on the Sept 2013 Chemo thread and although some seem very nice over there, it seems as though there are a few ladies that keep the conversations to themselves (not saying they aren't very nice women - and a gentleman hopped in last night - they are very nice but they seem to mostly converse with one another; kind of like the cliques you would see in High School).  Actually, they are a group of ladies from the August 2013 Chemo thread that felt uncomfortable in that thread (I believe what I read was \"yes, they are nice but not really where I want to be\").  I'm not sure what that meant but I think I can somewhat understand because I feel that way about how the Sept 2013 Chemo is - some just seem much more edgy than I myself am so I'm not really comfortable there. So I hope you all don't mind my hanging out here.  I'll pop into the Oct 2013 Chemo group to see how that is (I'm so late in Sept it probably is more where I should be anyway) but I just feel so comfortable with all you here and feel like I'm among friends.  I can share freely with all of you - and we've been thru many weeks together and ranted and sympathized and encouraged - its just comfy here. Hope everyone had a great (and as pain free as possible) day!",

I don\u2019t understand your question though about sleeping around the top of your drains \u2013 can you re-word that?  Maybe it\u2019s just me that doesn\u2019t understand.  Like to see you get an answer and perhaps one of us can help if we understand better what you mean.

OK - what's up with that? I never heard it mentioned anywhere online until today but apparently this person puts together care packages for chemo patients and includes very strong breath mints for the patients to suck on when the needle is removed because of this issue. So I wonder if any of you had that happen and if mints helped. I'm starting chemo this week with my newest implant (perhaps or perhaps not) - my port - and I'll pick up some Altoids to shove in my mouth before they remove the needle if this is actually true. Yes, I'm on an anxiety roller-coaster w/port issue, again, because I read on Friday night that sometimes they're in the neck. Sorry - no flippin way - nothings going in my neck. Chest...don't like the idea of it being cut into again but I'll deal with that but the neck....not happening. I'm fully prepared to sit up in the OR and announce to every person in the room before they knock me out \"no port in the neck! if it can't be placed in the chest then no port gets placed anywhere\". Seriously - good God in Heaven, no one ever said anything about that and it is really freaking me out. I know I sound like a basket case sometimes, I'm really not. Anxious....yeah, I'll admit I do get anxious when I find out something that is different than what I've read about or what others have experienced. And if the doctors figure to just conveniently not mention that little fact - well that doesn't sit well with me and yes, brings on a bit of anxiety. So I reaching out for some info here - did any of you end up w/a port in the neck or the tube running from your port up your neck? I'm incredibly thin and I have no desire to see a tube running up my neck just under the skin (and I'll see it - I am that thin) - and I can just hear doctors explanation now \"well you're so thin that we had to put it in the neck....\". Good thing I read about it beforehand so they don't get that opportunity! Seriously, my husband and I can see the TE's in the upper part of my chest - so I know a tube will be visible in my skinny neck. I can handle it if it's in my chest because I'm not seeing that when I look in the mirror but my neck is always visible. Help! Why is this all so horrific w/so many differences on how things are done? Port in chest - that's what I thought was what everyone was talking about in what I've read online so now I wonder if that part of the surgery will even happen. I'm not getting anything in my neck.......",

It must feel nice knowing you will only have 4 to go! Yea, it is a pain w/scheduling and work with all these changes in my start date, that's certainly true. I don't think they really think about that either, but I wouldn't expect them to. It's their job to get the therapy going when it is safest to do so - they have a lot of patients and they have their goal to get us as healthy as possible in the safest manner so we can't expect them to concern themselves with all our schedules. It's just my unfortunate circumstances, that's all. The Oncology department is very full here and it's just what I have to deal with - would have been nice if we could have gotten some of these tests done sooner - but there's a lot of things in life that \"would have been nice\". All I really care about is making sure I'm in the best health possible before starting. That's my best bet for getting thru it all with the least amt of SE's. I'm mostly just bummed about Thanksgiving and Christmas. But I don't want to wait 2 weeks just to get a good holiday schedule - there will be plenty of holidays in my future (God willing) so if this year I'm a little out of sorts, then so be it. Wish I could do something fun with the next week but right now I have to concentrate on healing. The under arm is really got some pain happenin there! More than I expected. You know, when you have BMX and immediate reconstruction, the majority of pain is EVERYWHERE FROM THE WAIST UP TO THE NECK (all you with the same procedures know what I'm talking about)! Kind of lose sight of where the pain is and where it isn't, know what I mean. But I had in my head it was \"in the breast area\" where all the pain was and just generated outward. Obviously there was pain in the armpits but was overshadowed by where I thought all the pain was originating. Well, I'm learning now there was more pain IN the underarm than I knew because it's making itself very well known at the moment. Oh well, the pain will lessen and I feel better with that node out of my body and they can properly test it. Rest up, KBeee - you need your strength for #2!! And best of luck - let us know how you do!",

I was looking for some recipe books to purchase that outlined nutritional foods for chemo and beyond and I ran across one particular book called  \"What to Eat During Cancer Treatment: 100 Great-Tasting, Family-Friendly Recipes to Help You Cope\".  Looks like a very easy recipe book and wanted to pass on the info in case anyone was interested - I found the book at Amazon,  I was able to read a sample and what I liked best is they have the recipes coded so it's easy to find recipes for when you're dealing with nausea, when you have diarrhea, constipation, sore mouth and difficulty swallowing, taste alterations, and weight loss (very nice to have that reference as it applies to each recipe!).  I also found another recipe (I don't think it's in that recipe book) that I wanted to pass on (I posted it in the Oct 2013 Chemo thread so they had it in case anyone there was interested).  I plan on making it today or tomorrow and freeze it - thought whoever is going thru chemo might be interested.  So here it is: MAGIC MINERAL BROTH This broth alone can keep people going, especially when they don\u2019t particularly want to eat.  It\u2019s not just a regular vegetable stock.  This pot of \u201cyum\u201d is high in potassium and numerous trace minerals that are often depleted by cancer therapy.  Sipping this nutrient-rich stock is like giving your body an internal spa treatment.  Drink it as a tea or use it as a base for all your favorite soups and rice dishes.  Don\u2019t be daunted by the ingredient list.  Simply chop the ingredients in chunks and throw them in the pot, roots, skins, and all! 6 unpeeled carrots / cut in thirds 2 unpeeled medium yellow onions / cut into chunks 1 leek \u2013 both white and green parts / cut in thirds 1 bunch celery-including the heart / cut in thirds 5 unpeeled cloves of garlic / halved ½ bunch fresh flat leaf parsley 4 medium red potatoes \u2013 with skins on / quartered 2 Japanese or regular sweet potatoes-with skins on / quartered 1 Garnet yam \u2013 with skin on / quartered 1 (8-inch) strip of kombu (Iceland Kelp Seaweed) 2 bay leaves 12 black peppercorns 4 whole allspice or juniper berries 1 tablespoon sea salt Rinse all the vegetables well, including the kombu.  In a large stock pot (12 qtrs. or larger), combine all the ingredients, except the salt.  Fill the pot to 2 inches below the rim with water. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, decrease heat to low and simmer for a minimum of 2 hours.  As the stock simmers, some of the water will evaporate; add more if vegetables begin to peek out.  Simmer until the full richness of the vegetables can be tasted.  Add the sea salt; stir. Strain the stock using a large coarse-mesh strainer (make sure you use a heat-resistant container underneath).Bring to room temp before refrigerating or freezing. Broth can be frozen for up to 6 months in a variety of airtight containers for every use. I'll let you know what I think - but my taste might be different from others...... ",

hours a night.  It was not a pleasant recovery but I guess since both breasts are now gone, I\u2019ll never have to face that recovery again (trying to be positive about something).  Not only did I go to work the first time on Monday, I also drove for the first time and wore deodorant for the first time!  Was not about to return to work without that little safeguard.  It felt great to drive!  I\u2019m really amazed at how much I improved from last Monday to last Friday \u2013 obviously somewhere in there a huge turning point happened and I finally felt better (took long enough!).  It feels good being back to work even for just ½ days\u2026.makes a big difference getting out of the house and returning to some normality.  I love your comment about pulling your hair out!  I think many of us are not going to have to worry about that very soon now.  Jo, I wish you the best of luck tomorrow with your surgery.  My thoughts and prayers will be with you and hope you have a speedy recovery.  Please, as soon as you\u2019re feeling up to it, let us all know how it went and how you are feeling.  Babs \u2013  I am so thankful my doctor finally released me for work even if just for ½ days for

to be able to be paid for a full days work even if only working ½ days \u2013 I miss those days where I was salary but those days were much more stressful than my current job so in the end I\u2019m happy with the set-up I have.  And, since I can work out of my home so that I\u2019m actually working full-time hours, it works out very well because it keeps me busy.  Aviva \u2013 congrats to you on getting your drains removed!  You cracked me up with your \u201cemotionally draining\u201d comment \u2013 I had not realized I wrote that.  Perhaps it was my subconscious \u2013 because it is making me emotional at this point.  I\u2019m actually feeling quite down and out about it.  I know I\u2019ve jested about it, but these last 2 days it\u2019s wearing on me a great deal.  I just want them out, and there\u2019s nothing I can do to get there.  Other than another expansion my PS agreed to do this Friday\u2026\u2026I just don\u2019t understand why nearly every other woman has them out within 3 weeks or less and I\u2019m at 5 weeks and still see no end in sight.  It\u2019s depressing.  Are you experiencing any signs of Lymphedema?  You\u2019re going to PT \u2013 did something happen or are you doing this as a precaution?   Where in the arm does that port go that you read about?  I\u2019ve never heard of that but I\u2019ve not researched anything to do with chemo (besides scarves and caps/hats).  I think I\u2019m the only one in this group of ours that is Triple Negative.  I know chemo is very individualized.  Therefore, I have purposely stayed away from research and will let my MO tell me what applies to me, then I\u2019ll go research what I\u2019m told.  I think the chemo regimen is different for TNBC so instead of confusing myself with the plethora of info online, I\u2019ll wait.  Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I think it\u2019s great you\u2019ve researched and you found info out you were able to share regarding arm placement of the port \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to research because I know so little about what they use for TNBC.  My BS offered to place a port but I told him \u201cno way \u2013 I\u2019ve got good veins and they can use those\u201d.  However, I\u2019ve never heard (and he never said anything to me) about an arm port.  Please let me know what your Oncologist says about it on Thurs (my MO appt is Monday 9/16).  Honeybair \u2013 congrats on your drain removal!  Do you have signs of Lymphedema or are you also going to PT as a precaution?  Both you and Aviva are both going so I\u2019m curious.  I\u2019ve had shooting electrical type pains shooting from my underarm incision (where I developed seroma) down the inside of the arm to the elbow when I stretch my arm out.  It had gotten much better but I\u2019m obviously not paying very close attention at work and stretching it too much reaching for things that it is acting up again almost as bad as at 1 week post op.  I was told on another thread it was nerve damage; I read on another thread it could be Lymphedema; my BS said it was seroma pressing on nerve or the tube on that side is pressing on a nerve.  What do I know?  I don\u2019t want to go to PT if it\u2019s not needed ( I already missed more work than I expected and don\u2019t want to lose more \u2013 and I have upcoming chemo as well so if I don\u2019t need PT, I don\u2019t want to use it as a precaution in my individual case).  My first thought was nerve damage (which makes sense since the BS can\u2019t see nerves they\u2019re easy enough to cut) \u2013 and unless I develop swelling in the arm, hand or trunk \u2013 I\u2019m going to go with the nerve damage theory.  But I want to know what you 2 have going on to have made the decision to go to PT.  Pam \u2013 let us know how your labs and CT scan went today.  Hope they didn\u2019t find anything that delays treatment.  Are they doing CT scan in lieu of a PET Scan?  Wrenn \u2013 I agree with Honeybair.  I believe it is the output amount that determines when to remove the drain and not the color.  However, if you get to the time-frame I\u2019m at and if you still had very red drainage, then they might consider that a cause for concern.  Mine looks exactly like they want it to \u2013 kind of a yellow-orange color (like a really, really dark first morning urine \u2013 although I\u2019ve never had that dark of color urine but I digress).   You\u2019re about 3-4 weeks post op so I wouldn\u2019t be concerned with the color \u2013 but if YOU are concerned, please call your BS or PS.  Either can tell you if there is any reason for concern and then you\u2019re mind is put at ease.  Or just wait til Thurs for your next appt.  Hmmmm, I just looked at your diagnosis and you are TN as well.  I hadn\u2019t noticed that before.  I guess you and I will be comparing notes on this journey \u2013 and our surgery dates were only 9 days apart.   Have you met with Oncology yet? It also seems we are a bit alike in that we seem to drain much more that other ladies.  Not that there is anything wrong with it and it\u2019s not unheard of \u2013 but we are outside the \u201cnormal\u201d timeframe which is just the way our bodies handle the surgeries we endured.  I hope your draining continues to decrease and you have it removed soon.  They are a pain and I personally never want to see another one as long as I live!  KBeee \u2013 glad you got some of your hairpieces.  You sound a little like me in that I want to be prepared ahead of time \u2013 I want what I need on hand before I need it.  I ordered some scarves and caps which I should receive tomorrow.  I\u2019ve watched quite a few Youtube videos on scarf tying and am looking forward to being able to play around with them.  And learning how to wear them before the actual need arises.  There are just so many cute ones out there and I\u2019ve found some really inexpensive places online that I\u2019m looking forward to building quite a wardrobe of them.  Personally, I think I would be too uncomfortable in a wig with all I\u2019ve read on scalp tenderness.  Then there\u2019s the issue of my chronic headaches and I worry how wearing a wig would affect that.  With scarves, I can make them as loose or tight as I want (or feel) so I think it\u2019s the best choice for me.  You are one courageous lady planting 25 tomato plants!  You must have had a great deal of tomatoes.  It takes many, many tomatoes to make that amount of salsa!  You were obviously a very busy gal.  And more to come, huh?  Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing you have some extra time on your hands recovering; well, you might need a recovery period from putting up all your tomatoes when you\u2019re all done with that!!!!  Sorry if I missed anybody.  Hope everybody had a great day and stay healthy!!!

He asked me what they would do if I am now anemic or if I become anemic during chemo.  I told him I wasn't sure, but figured they would probably give me IV's of B-12 or other B vitamins to combat that problem (nothing I've tried with nutrition helps and iron supplements upset my stomach too much that I refuse to take them). So I wonder if you are anemic as well and if so, did your Oncologist suggest anything to bring up your iron before having to resort to transfusion?",

Sorry to hear your not feeling great yet, either.  Sounds like you're doing the same but not really making a lot of progress - you really are having a hard time with recovery and my heart goes out to you. Great job in raising $500 so far for the Run for the Cure! Can I recommend something that might make you more comfortable?  I cannot wear any type of bra.  I tried but the band goes right over where the holes are trying to heal in my sides.  I was given the OK to wear a bra by Plastic Surgeon BUT when I went to get fitted for temporary prosthesis (aka foobs) the nurse there told me I should NOT be wearing any bra until 10 days after the tubes/drains are removed.  As soon as I heard that - I went with it (given how painful wearing a sports bra was - so painful I didn't last an hour in it before I was begging my husband to help me out of it!).  I hopped online and ordered some tube tops.  I ordered several different kinds; some regular tube tops, some tube tops that had gathering in the center and modesty pads (good for me so I could put my silicone enhancers or foobs in the pockets instead of the modesty pads), and finally the ones I wear most often....tube tops with pockets (for foobs or enhancers) with removable straps.  That's important since I have nothing left of a natural breast so trying to keep the regular tube tops in place was nearly impossible.  The ones w/o straps will not go to waste, though, because I understand when I have the exchange for the final implants that tube tops are actually recommended to wear post-surgery. I purchased mine at Amazon.com - and I know you have access to that in Canada.  They were really well priced and I received them very quickly.  They wash and dry very nicely and the bottom banding is almost 1 to 1-1/2 inches lower than a regular bra so it does not cause any discomfort where you say your sports bra is bothering you. I wouldn't recommend you purchasing these if you were progressing quickly in your recovery.  But you seem to have had a lot of issues and I'm thinking further recovery will continue to be slow (I don't mean to bum you out by saying that - I'm just saying what I think given how you've done so far).  If you type in:  anemone seamless removable strap bra you will see them come up in a 2 or 4 pack.  I paid under $9.00 for a 2 pack - so very reasonably priced even if you only need them for a month! These have been a godsend to me!  My sides are still very sore so even if I could wear a bra, I wouldn't because it would only aggrevate the area.  Probably the best $9.00 I spent for post surgical items to help with this \"new\" body I find myself with.  And I can use these as I'm expanded so I'll get plenty of use out of them. I do hope you feel better soon.  I feel so bad for you and wish things would just get better.  But our bodies do what their going to do and we are at it's mercy sometimes.  You take care.  Rest is good; get plenty!  Our bodies heal when we rest so it's a good thing. I'm keeping you in my prayers.",

I\u2019ve not been one for the meditation tapes \u2013 I\u2019ve tried them for my headaches.  Personally I find if I just try to relax as best as possible given whatever pain level I\u2019m at, then remember some of the happiest times in my life \u2013 then I replay them over and over in my mind.  That\u2019s what has worked for me but I can tell you many, many people find the meditation tapes very helpful.  You have to find what is right for you.  Here again, if you have nervousness/anxiety issues, you might find either of these 2 methods too difficult to find a relaxed state \u2013 you may need a very low dose anti-anxiety medication.  I don\u2019t know, but I encourage you to talk to your doctor about your fears and your desire to find a way to relax/meditate during chemotherapy.  Only your doctor and you know what is best but I encourage you to bring the subject up and get a plan in place now.  Pam \u2013 I\u2019ve never heard of a PICC Line.  I just Google\u2019d it and don\u2019t want to read all the gory details (I\u2019m such a wimp, I know!).  You are correct; I do NOT want anything surgically implanted in my chest and it seems the UW doesn\u2019t do ports in the arm.  So if you could tell me a little more about a PICC line without getting too much into details that will gross me out\u2026.I\u2019d appreciate it.  Is it a permanent placement?  I know my husbands co-worker said she appreciated that all her blood draws could be done via her port so I know the UW is comfortable with that \u2013 I\u2019ve never had an issue w/blood draws and I\u2019ve certainly had more than my fair share of them.  And I only had 2 nodes removed from each side so I\u2019m not really at huge risk for lymphedema \u2013 I believe they can freely use either arm for anything.  But if you can enlighten me a little more on the PICC line I\u2019d like to hear about it \u2013 so I can bring it up if I hear \u201cLisa, we can\u2019t use your veins anymore so we need to put in a port\u201d \u2013 I want something \u2013 ANYTHING \u2013 to suggest to keep from going that route.   I just went and changed my diagnosis \u2013 glad you brought that up!  When I saw MO this past Monday, she said the amount of cancer found in the right node does NOT mean \u201cpositive for cancer\u201d.  The reasoning she said was this:  when the amount of cancerous cells found is minimal, they actually count the number of cells that are positive.  If the amount is less than 200, they consider that NEGATIVE.  And she said \u201cthey really do sit there and count the number of cells\u201d.  Here\u2019s what they believe with that node \u2013 I\u2019ve had so many procedures done on my breasts and it is conceivable that during one of those procedures a few cancer cells broke loose and just ended up in the lymph node.  I can buy that \u2013 so she said that changes the \u201cpositive node involvement\u201d to a negative.  She ordered the PET scan to get a better handle on Staging.  There were \u201cpepperings\u201d of very small IDC in the left breast.  They were unable, and they were asked by my BS to clarify, to give an amount of what \u201cpeppering\u201d meant.  So the PET scan is going to give us a better idea of what staging should be applied to my cancer (I may be changing that diagnosis in my profile as well, hopefully for the better!).  So in essence, I have NO node involvement, as things stand right now.  Subject to change?  I don\u2019t know\u2026.this is all so confusing to me.  I\u2019m like Wrenn in that way as well \u2013 I go with the flow.  I trust my medical team completely and the UW Carbone Cancer Center is very highly regarded in the country so I feel fortunate I have them and know they are all highly skilled at what they do and I know so little\u2026..I go with what they tell me.  Obviously I do my own research but that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t have one of these doctors at my beck and call so you gotta turn somewhere, right.  And this forum is a huge help!  I\u2019d never heard of chemo port in the arm (thanks to Aviva I knew about it so I could ask) and I never heard about a PICC line \u2013 thanks to you for bringing that issue to me so I can ask about that as well.   Aviva - it's FRUSTRATING that not every BS knows or does or whatever....w/ports!  You would think it would be standard.....a patient can have an arm port or a patient can have a chest port.  Sounds simple enought but they make it so frustrating that you just want to pull your hair out (well, some of us won't be able to use that line in the near future...) but you know what I mean.  Why is nothing just \"standard\"??? So much to know?  How does anybody do it without the benefit of a forum like this? ",

As always, my greatest gratitude to all who can help.  I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without having this forum to turn to \u2013 we\u2019re all in this together at the same time and everyone is so supportive and encouraging and helpful!  It\u2019s truly been a Godsend to me!!!!!",

And I also agree that if I were in that state\u2026.I\u2019d want to be sent home and let nature takes its course.  At least I\u2019d be in familiar and comfortable surroundings instead of some sterile cold hospital room.  I hope you continue to get your rest and are able to do your massages 3x/day as directed.  When you feel up to it, let us know how you are doing.",

Regarding keeping your head warm - my hair began falling out exactly on day 14 like I had been told.  My infusion nurse told me \"AC is like clockwork - hair begins falling out on day 14\", and it did.  So 2 days later I begrudgingly had it shaved and living in Wisconsin, I understand cold weather.  I was very shocked with how much heat is lost with no hair but I was prepared ahead of time.  I purchased different colored fleece caps (double layer of fleece) to wear around the house and under scarves and I have to say....they are actually too warm right now but I'm sure once the temps dip in to the single digits and below zero (yikes - coming too soon!) I will appreciate them more. I found mine on Amazon but you appear to be more of an Ebay shopper and I'm sure you can find them there. I don't know about you and I think none of us know until the time comes where we lose our hair....but I have a very small head!  So the caps for under scarves are a necessity to fill out the scarf!  I purchased several pre-ties scarves that are \"somewhat\" like the Hijabs you ordered (I think...I looked at Hijabs as well because I liked the look but opted for Bohemian Style Head Coverings that have some fullness in the back along with decorative draping in the back) and when I ordered them, the description said \"fits most heads\".  Well, they fit me perfectly when I tried them on when I still had my hair, but once the head was shaved, they are a little too big.  Oh well, I have the caps to wear underneath to fill them out so all worked out in the end. Hope that helps.  And...I sure hope you start feeling better soon!!!!!!!  And do what you can to keep that head warm!  The head gets cold....everything is cold (just like your feet - if they get cold the entire body seems to feel cold).",

Everyone here is so supportive and we are not so big that anyone gets lost in the mix. And to interact with women going thru the same things at the same time....priceless! So I agree with you, Wrenn, this forum is literally a Godsend to some of us! I wholeheartedly agree with your decision to hold off chemo and allow some further healing. It sounds like KBeee was the post that helped put things in perspective (kind of like Honeybair did for me this past week) - so good to have so many different women from all over the world being able to help out. It just takes that one person to put it in words you need to hear to help us see things better. Ten people can say the same thing but it's that eleventh person who says it a certain way that it finally clicks - always amazes me how that happens and it's great KBeee found those words that seem to clicked for you.

When you leave, I'd like to know if you have the same experience as myself.  I left the infusion center feeling as great as I did going in.  Later that evening side effects started but by calling the MO on call, he prescribed meds that took care of those issues.  I developed worse SE' after chemo 2, but a long discussion yesterday at Chemo#3 w/my MO she was able tell me what I was going thru BUT THEY HAVE REMEDIES.  Of course, I simply thought it was fatigue but she disagreed (and my blood work backed it up in that all my counts look good).  She said I'm to simply add 2-3 extra days of the steroid at 1/2 the dose to ease thru those terrible fatigue days.  She also pulled up a medical study showing American Gingseng has been shown to help relieve Chemo Related Fatigue and asked that I pick that up in pill form and take 1000iu 2x day.  So....if I had called her after Chemo#2 I may not have suffered as badly as I had.  Moral of the story....if you are feeling poorly, call your MO (and don't do what I did thinking it was just fatigue that I've read many women suffer from). You will do fine.  You had a long wait for this day, you've had plenty of time going over the risks and benefits and I, for one, fully respect your decision.  If it can reduce your reccurance rate by 10%, that's a huge and hopefully you realized that and said to yourself \"yeah, it's worth it and then I never need to look back thinking I didn't do everything possible to kill this disease once and for all\". Your on my mind today, Wrenn.  If you feel well enough when you return home, please post us a message and let us know how things went. All our Love to you today! Lisa",

I forget which cancer forum I ended up at when I googled \"port placement\" but there were a bunch that had the catheter running up their neck to their carotoid artery (gross!). Then I ended up somewhere else where women actually ended up with the port in their neck (that's what they said). All the ones w/catheter running up the neck seemed to have had horrible pain for many days following placement. Many women stated it was worse pain than the mastectomy - hence my anxiousness. I don't have many(any) clothes that go up very far on the chest. Mostly cami's and tanks. So I know there is a possibility the port may be seen on the chest (oh well - nobody but my husband should be looking at my chest anyway!) but I can deal with that. I've prepared myself mentally for that. But the neck - isn't that gross to you? Yuck!!!!! Thanks, once again, for your calmness!

I did in fact get info when I first met w/my MO \u2013 but I do not see the \"magic mouthwash\" recipe in it (and it is an actual binder of approx 100 pages!).I do, in fact, have very good drug coverage so I\u2019ll probably go with the prescription version.But if it does not work very well, I now have the home-made version.With all drug versions of \"healing what ails you\"\u2026. we have found in our household that often times the home-made remedies work faster and more effectively.So, I now have that \"little ace in the hole\" should I need it.Thanks, Ladies!!!!! I was wondering why I wasn\u2019t seeing the recipe for the mouthwash but instead kept reading at many threads about \"magic mouthwash\" and was wondering \"what the heck \u2013 what is that and why is nobody writing out what it is?\" \u2013 makes sense if it is often given in the form of prescription.I know so little, but learn much for you brave women who have gone before me. I am in full agreement w/KBeee and the 2 of you \u2013 I am pretty well versed on what SE\u2019s CAN happen but since I\u2019ve no clue if I will sail thru this w/only minor inconveniences or be hit hard and be knocked on my bum\u2026\u2026I\u2019m just going to go with the flow and see how I\u2019m affected.With a positive attitude; and with the knowledge that there are many women who HAVE gotten thru chemo w/only minor issues and I may be one of the lucky.I\u2019m informed and prepared for the worst (as prepared as one could be, I guess) but not concerned about what might happen.I\u2019m not wasting energy worrying about things that might not happen; I deal with what comes my way when whatever comes my way. Surgery today sucked.I was there from 7:00 until 2:00 \u2013 very long day!And, yes, quite a bit of pain.Well, that was expected.But I\u2019m really happy I got a port!I had some issues w/IV in the hospital after BMX (backed up and then hours later started leaking and I thought it was just a fluke circumstance) but then this morning they had a difficult time getting IV set.Took one nurse 3 tries (might I add it was really, horribly painful w/all the digging!!!!) and she had to call another nurse to get it placed.He got it \u2013 took him a bit but he got it \u2013 but it hurt the entire time it was in.So perhaps my veins are not as healthy as they had been all my life.I can tell you after the BMX IV issues and now today, I\u2019m so very thankful I opted for a port because I certainly would not want to go thru the horror of this morning each time I have chemo w/them trying to get the IV placed! Sounds like I may not get pathology back on the removed node until early next week.If that node is cancerous, I don\u2019t know what that will mean.I didn\u2019t think to ask.I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll do another PET scan right away if to see if the underarm is still lighting up (meaning there\u2019s likely more cancer still there).I would guess they would; well they\u2019d probably wait for surgery inflammation to go down first\u2026\u2026.so they know if they need to do an ALND after chemo \u2013 I just don\u2019t know.Best put that on my list of questions for MO tomorrow morning!Any of you ladies have this issue?And if so, what did they do? Jeannine \u2013 hope your radiation went well today!Oh, and it\u2019s good to finally know what that \"white icky\" is!I kept reading it and wondering what it was\u2026\u2026 Wrenn \u2013 hope your MO visit went well today and there is total agreement among all parties to wait the 2 weeks so you can heal a little further before moving on to next step. Honeybair \u2013 see, there are strange, GOOD things that can happen w/chemo.Who knows\u2026.???We all have to just wait and see if something unexpected happens to each of us that clears up a completely separate medical issue. Other than work, I totally plan to stay away from crowds!I have an insane amount of hand sanitizer already on hand for at work (which will no doubt dry out my hands!) so I say the better we can protect ourselves\u2026the better!!!!Being that I\u2019ve tried just about every moisturizer out there with my psoriasis condition, I think I\u2019ll stay w/my Amlactin.It\u2019s a good product, no fragrance, and is one of the best I\u2019ve found.It\u2019s actually what professional swimmers use because the chlorine dries out their skin so bad (it\u2019s really a good product \u2013 if anyone is interested look into it.) Babs \u2013 are you still feeling well after your first fill?Can I give you a little advice?I don\u2019t know if they would do it with you but I had 50cc\u2019s my first fill, too.This last time\u2026.100cc\u2019s in each and it was very painful for about 48 hours.Like, totally unexpected pain.Because like yourself, the first fill went very well (had discomfort for first 24 hours but not pain in any way).And the nurse kept asking, and I was paying very close attention, if any discomfort happened during the 100cc fills and nothing \u2013 I felt fine.But a couple hours later \u2013 WOW, spasms kicked in like nobody\u2019s business!Right side was worse and the right upper back was the biggest area of pain.So if you can go \"low and slow\" you might want to do that.You know, why am I telling you this?You work for a Plastic Surgeon, right?So you know all this anyway!Sorry, forgot about that, I\u2019ll shut up now. I hope everyone has a good evening.As always, I keep each of you in my thoughts and prayers!",

Babs - thanks for the info. I'm hearing times all over the place and I think the 4-6 hours I was told was to include everything. And I'm just looking for infusion times (my MO sets diff appointment times for blood draw, her office visit) which can take 1-1/2 hours by itself. So when I get a chemo time and they state 2 hours....do you think that's a good ballpark time frame? I sched my PS expansion times to be about 2 hours AFTER the 4 hour timeframe they gave me. Figured we could go grab a bite to eat or coffee (or go on a scone hunt!) between visits. It's an hour drive to chemo infusion and 45 minute drive to PS (one-way) so it's really an inconvenience to have to travel down there twice if I can go it all in one day. I'll have to think this all over given the info everyones given me.... Jeannine - I hope your rads continue to go well and you can keep ticking them off as one step closer to being done! I ended up in ER last evening. Nothing bad and I really felt foolish having to go but the BS said I had to and I even spoke w/an on-call nurse at our insurance company (being a weekend) and she said the same thing - you need to get to ER. I woke yesterday and my right arm had a funny feeling. Felt like muscular pain so I ignored it. Thought it was to be expected given that I had just had surgery. A few hours later I looked and noticed it was swollen; my husband and I measured and sure enough, it was 1/2 more than left arm both above the elbow and below. So, I ignored it some more. Then my better judgment kicked in and I reviewed my discharge papers from Wed surgery and sure enough, there it was \"call surgeon immediately is any swelling in face, neck or arm.\" Called him and was told to elevate arm over the heart for several hours. If swelling didn't go down, I was told to get to ER so they could do US. So I elevated it for 4 hours then called on-call nurse because I didn't know what hospital I was supposed to go to (we have an HMO and my BMX surgery was done at one hospital but all the phyicians and the surgical center I had Wed outpatient surgery at were at UW facilities) - she said go to UW. Of course that just made my not wanting to go even more so - UW is where EVERYBODY goes and I could imagine the wait we'd have. So I asked \"what is the big deal here? I'm assuming it's just lymphedema starting and I dont' think there's any emergency with that...\" to which she replied \"that could be the problem but you had surgery in 2 areas and now the arm is swollen. That tells us you could have a blood clot and given where those 2 surgeries were, if a blood clot is there and breaks loose it does not need to travel far to get to the heart which could be deadly\". OK - that got my attention. Still felt like a fool at ER because of swollen arm! Of course, US showed no blood clot. They did some labs and everything looked fine so I was sent home and told to f/u w/family doc on Monday. 5 hours in ER on a Saturday evening......but I guess it made the docs feel better I was seen (and hubby, too) - it just seemed like a little over-kill to me but better safe than sorry. Hoping everyone has a great day!",

But can you imagine how stupid I feel looking at my ER discharge papers and it says, the reason for visit....here it comes.....\"swollen arm\". Now that might put it in a little more context for everyone to understand why I feel like an idiot (told that same thing to my daughter and when she heard it, she said \"ok, I get where you're coming from now\".) Oh well, I did what I was told to and everything is fine so that's what's most important. My family doc believes it is Lymphedema in the right arm - this crap never ends, does it! I go to PT on 10/31 and will see what's up. I also have my Genetics Counseling set up for 11/14. All these appointments are driving me crazy and I still need to fit in my expansions w/PT!!! I don't remember is I mentioned last week my doctor also believes I'm suffering from Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. I had read about that and wondered if it might apply to me back when I had that tight tape like feeling in the breast area. But when the tubes were taken out and all that pain/discomfort resolved, I didn't give that Syndrome a second thought. I have had an electrical sensation going down the left inside arm right after BMX. BS thought seroma was laying on a nerve but the seroma is resolved and the pain has gotten MUCH worse since returning to work and now goes all the way down into the hand. I was just letting it go and figured the next time I see my family doctor we'd chat about it (BS checked it out last Wed before surgery and was at a loss as to why it was happening). Well, on Thurs when I was able to start using my right arm....the same electrical type pain was going down the inside of that arm. Great! Just Great! So I called my doc and we talked about it and I asked if she could do some research to find out if this was nerve damage from node removals or what (because that's what made sense to me). Well, she got back to me about the Syndrome (they have a flippin syndrome for everything!) and so I started on Lyrica last week to see if that will help. I need to get it built up to a decent dosage; I've had problems w/this med before (and every anti-convulsant I've tried for headaches) in it making me very, very tired. But, if it helps my arms then I'll just have to get used to be tired! Anyone else have that electrical type feeling go down their arms after surgery? Sorry to see we lost some ladies in our little group. I know there are other threads we all join in but I had hoped we'd all stay together and follow one another thru this journey - perhaps that was naïve of me...... Oh well, we still have a good, strong and tight group; and I know it's harder to post as much as we had as we are all returning to work and our \"regular\" lives, but it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on board here. KBeee - I'm so glad you continue to tolerate your chemo so well! I hope to be the same (although I'll not hold my breath - but I can hope)! Hope everyone is doing well. Have a wonderful Autumn evening! As always, my thoughts and prayers are with you all!",

I know you have had your share of sad times in your recovery (and it\u2019s certainly understandable!) and this article should bring you a great deal of comfort. I can tell you it has for me! I\u2019ve been trying to stay positive because I keep being told \u201cyou have to be positive to get thru this\u201d. And I\u2019ve done pretty darn well, considering. But I wonder if people who do not suffer from anxiety or from chronic pain really understand what life is like dealing with those issues nearly every day, with no end in sight. And how those issues really drag down a person no matter how hard they try to stay positive, long term anxiety and chronic pain that either is not treated properly or the medical professionals don\u2019t know how to treat it\u2026.it\u2019s nearly impossible to be positive in any way! Then throw cancer at us\u2026\u2026well, staying positive is just impossible at times. Wrenn, reading this article NAILS it! It talks about cancer and sadness; which I know you and I have had our issues dealing with even if in different ways. I think everyone here knows me well enough they can tell when I\u2019ve been overwhelmed, felt like I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen or when it would finally happen (and could probably feel my anxiety reaching sky-high right thru the internet!). And everyone here has been with you right from the beginning and knows when things are not going well for you. You either become very quiet and we don\u2019t hear from you\u2026..or you, as you say, \u201cvent\u201d which is really not venting. You\u2019re getting out your feelings that need to be gotten out with a group of women who understand. We all deal with our issues in our own ways \u2013 you and I may be more open about our anxiety and sadnesses perhaps because we may have had more of it in our lives before cancer hit us. You know what \u2013 all the wonderful, caring ladies here have done exactly what this article talks about and have wrapped us in their arms and helped us thru some of the toughest times we\u2019ve faced in our lives. We have much to be thankful for (isn\u2019t it your Thanksgiving there in Canada?) with this forum and more importantly, with the wonderful ladies in this thread that have helped us so much even though none of us have ever met. Thanks for sharing the article, Wrenn. If for nothing else, I want you to know how much comfort it has brought me. For now, I\u2019ve got a positive attitude (but that changes in a second, given the circumstance). How about you? How are you feeling? And, how is your recovery coming along and are you still on track to start chemo soon?",

Does that perhaps sound similar to what you had?  I don't know what led to your diagnosis but I'm trying to help you stay calm until you can speak with your BS or family doc.  If I were in your shoes...I'd probably be feeling just like you are so please don't think I'm preaching.  Are you going to ask for another test (like an MRI or ultrasound) to see if they can get a clearer picture?  Are you going to ask for a biopsy?   I think that's what I'd be asking my BS if I had a similar situation; I don't think I could just let it go for 6 months.  Did you research recurrence statistics and such so you are \"armed\" with that info when you speak with whoever ordered the mammo?  It's something you could do to occupy your time over the weekend so first thing tomorrow morning you can make that call and get things clarified. I really am sorry you got news that has upset you but try to remember it might not be anything to get too worked up over.  Just do what research you can to keep busy and then call in the morning.  It's so frustrating for you, I can tell, and to have gotten the letter on a Saturday didn't help matters either.  But you've been here before (I know, which is why you feel like you do) and things seem to always pop up that makes us wait for answers, but I hope you get some clarification tomorrow that eases your mind; either something concrete that assures you it is very likely not cancer or some course of additional testing that can determine one way or the other if it IS or IS NOT something to be worried about. You are in my thoughts and prayers.  Let us know how your discussion goes tomorrow.",

I have to say, I thought I had it very easy after the chemo when nausua was controlled thru Saturday morning....then all went to hell.  My MO put me back on Dexomethasone yesterday morning for 2 more days hoping to relieve these horrible body pains and headaches that have become wicked bad.

Regarding your office visit schedule \u2013 first, have you counted the weeks forward to see if you will be needing a visit to the doctor the week of Christmas? If you do, can you call them NOW and get that appointment scheduled for either Monday or Tuesday before Christmas \u2013 or get appointment scheduled for Thurs or Friday after Christmas.  That\u2019s the normal practice at medical offices when patients are on set schedules to be seen.  They will work with you to keep your schedule on track. Glad you are continuing to eat!  I had long talks w/MO and Infustion nurse yesterday at chemo.  I had gained 5 lbs in the 24 hours after chemo (water retention from the steroids) but then proceeded to drop 15 lbs in the next 4 days because I simply could not eat.  Broke my heart dropping all that weight I had worked so hard at gaining before going into chemo\u2026.and I only gained 3 lbs back by chemo time yesterday. So here is an urgent request going out to all ladies \u2013 I am aware of the foods that are high in protein and calories (most everyone I tried after 1st chemo made me feel sick).  I know there are protein powders out there and those often times will be mixed with frozen yogurt or ice-cream and mixed fruit to make smoothies (and I cannot drink anything milk based, I found out, the consistency makes me sick). I have a co-worker who had worked in Food Service and told me about a product called Resource 206 with is a powder or liquid that nursing homes often use to mix in their clients meals to keep getting high calories/proteins in them w/o them even knowing it.  THAT\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for---a tasteless powder type product of high protein/calories that I could drop in my water, juice, coffee, soda, ect.  (Kind of like how Mirilax works \u2013 you can dump that power in any liquid and it has not taste but gets into your system to do what it needs to do.  DOES ANYONE KNOW A PRODUCT LIKE THAT?  I have no more weight to loose and if this post chemo session goes as the last, I\u2019m going to end up widdled down to a very scary 103 lbs and that\u2019s just unhealthy!  ANY suggestions you all might have I\u2019m interested in hearing about.  The one thing that\u2019s out is the Protein bars \u2013 I have a whole stock of those, having used them to help get my initial weight back up prior to chemo but even 12 days post chemo (when I was no longer dealing w/any nausea issues) I could not stomach that protein bar.  I did find I could eat the Nature Made Salty Peanut bar. I actually ate 2 during the second chemo and they went down fine\u2026.for a short while.  As soon as I left the infusion center I was feeling GI issues and we still had to run over to PS for another expansion, having arrived an hour before my scheduled appointment.  I explained to the receptionist why I was there so early and how I was feeling and asked if there would be any way of being seen sooner so that I could get home before anything \u201cbad\u201d happened.  As always, these clinics are so understanding and in 3 minutes my nurse came out and we were done w/expansion and my PS peeked in to take a look and we were gone 30 minutes after arriving. Strange, I did not have that immediate reaction after the first chemo and I did have a large muffin I age during that therapy.  But when we feel our GI issues\u2026.I believe we have all learned that means \u201cyou might want to get home asap because things are going to start happening that may be quite unpleasant\u201d.  There was a point  to that story\u2026.I did eat 2 very light protein bars during chemo and even thru all the anti-nausea meds they were able to cause such an issue that made me very uncomfortable. So looking for any suggestions from you wonderful ladies on what I can do to GAIN weight. Babs \u2013 I hope your second expansion went well.  I was going to go for the full 100cc on each side like last time even though it caused me great discomfort for 48 hours.  My thinking, as I told my PS, was this \u201cThe anti-nausea med I take has a sleeping agent in it and I\u2019m likely to sleep for the next 3 days \u2013 so if I am made uncomfortable by the expansion it doesn\u2019t really matter because I\u2019ll be sleeping and should not feel the worst of it\u201d.  He laughed and said \u201cthat\u2019s one way to get thru an expansion that makes you uncomfortable\u201d.  He looked me over and said everything is looking exactly as it should so we proceeded with the fill.  However, once my nurse got up to 75 cc I told her I was feeling a lot of tightness and thought that might be a good place to stop.  So, ended up with 75cc on each side instead of 100cc.  Oh well.  I then asked her and my PS \u201cwhat size expanders were placed\u201d \u2013 PS didn\u2019t have his notes handy but said their standard practice is to implant 400 or 450 in someone my size.  I then asked what amount of expansion we should be using if I wanted to be a nice full B cup and he said that is too hard to determine.  BUT, in his opinion on how I now looked, I would still need 3 more expansions.  That\u2019s great news \u2013 fully expanded by Christmas; all AC treatments done before Christmas; and first Taxol treatment 6 days prior to Christmas.  Seems I got on a very manageable schedule \u2013 I hope it holds. OK, update for all those who have gone and purchased and are using Blood Builder.  I have to tell you this story because this product just really impressed me and it sure impressed the NP who saw me in lieu of MO yesterday.  After we had our discussion on how to better manage chemo this time, she said \u201clet\u2019s pop up your labs and take a look\u201d.  White counts way up (even a couple numbers over normal \u2013 so obviously the Neulasta works); Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are well in the normal ranges \u2013 she asked what I\u2019m doing to have brought those up to such a healthy level in such a short period of time and I told her \u201cIt\u2019s the Blood Builder\u201d.  She looked at me in a strange way so I said to her \u201cit seems you are not familiar with the product, is that right?\u201d I told her, \u201cIs Mega Foods Blood Builder and can be purchased at Amazon \u2013 and locally at Whole Foods (but much more expensive there)\u201d.  She wrote all the info down so she can pass it on to other patients suffering from Anemia but won\u2019t take iron supplements because of all the issues they cause.  I\u2019m thinking Amazon might be getting a large run on Blood Builder in the near future\u2026\u2026I\u2019m just so happy my PCP had asked around at our Complimentary Care clinic years ago and found this product to pass on to me.  And if my passing it on to others so they can get their numbers up\u2026.well, pay it forward it what its\u2019 all about! The only other issue w/my labs were low sodium.  I cut back on sodium after the huge water retention issue following the steroids taken w/chemo\u2026.I obviously cut back too much.  Easily remedied\u2026.I love salty foods and will eat more of them once the initial swelling goes down. We have in place the correct anti-nausea this time so that should not be a problem.  The memory issue\u2026.we will have to wait and see.  The Lorazepam I take which helps so well w/anti-nausea also makes me sleep rather deeply so I\u2019m to use that for the 1st 3 days following chemo.  That will take away the sleep deprivation issue my MO thought contributed to my memory issues.  If I STILL have the horrible feeling like my mind has been erased when I return to work, then she feels confident it is the SE of Chemo Brain and has asked me to either stop working or cut my hours as much as possible.  So we will have to wait and see what happens there.  So, plan in place and anything else that comes up I\u2019ll just call in to find out how to manage.  Oh, and nothing they can really do about the bone pain from Neulasta except add the Dexomethasone for a couple more days (which will mean having to take the Lorazepam those nights so I can sleep).  Which means a couple more days off work (I cannot work while Lorazepam \u2013 I cant\u2019 think clearly while taking it because it makes me so thoroughly tired).  We\u2019re just going to have to see what happens. Jo \u2013 was your BS or PS clear on how your breast would look after Lumpectomy?  It was my understanding that PS are VERY clear on what the expectation should be following the surgery.  And if a large amount of breast needs to be removed, they often will suggest a mastectomy for 2 reasons:  first, you will be more happy with the results; and second, it makes their job easier and less surgeries for you to correct that breast appearance.  And if I remember correctly, they are required by law to make that breast look as close to normal following your surgery \u2013 have you asked about that? My dx was showing very clearly defined areas of concern and lumpectomies were an option (never given to me but the doctors talked about it).  They felt confident they could get all the cancer out of both breasts w/lumpectomies but here was the problem.  I was a small chested woman and had already had a lumpectomy done on my left breast 20 years previously.  The problem is that too much beast tissue would have to be removed w/lumpectomies that is would have made in very difficult/impossible to reconstruct the breasts with all the damage that would have happened from lumpectomies.  The day I received my dx of cancer in both breast was the time it was brought up that my medical team was recommending bilateral mastectomies \u2013 reason being, exactly what happened to you, Jo.  They told me that the amount of breast tissue they would need to remove would not necessarily make reconstruction easy should I decide on lumpectomies instead.  In fact, I was told it would be very difficult, the changes of them getting both breasts to look the same in size, shape, and volume could never be done in one surgery, multiple surgeries would be required, and still the end result could not guarantee good results for the patient.  For me, it was a no-brainer.  I had cancer in both breasts, I wanted it out, and asked them to just please remove them both so I could have some assurance I could live with that all cancer was gone.  Then, start from scratch w/reconstruction (yet this, I\u2019m told, is what caused my very painful, long recovery just by virtue of what they need to do w/the pectoral muscle).  So it wasn\u2019t easy, I SO hate the idea of the surgery for final implants given all the pain I had the first time around, but felt my team fully informed me of how each procedure (lumpectomy vs mastectomy) would end up and let me make the call.  Since my decision fell right along the lines of theirs\u2026.BMX was scheduled. Did they do all that for you, Jo?  They should have\u2026..even should have directed you to sites online where you could see for yourself what lumpectomy results actually looked like.  It\u2019s such a huge decision I just so hope they didn\u2019t give you so little information and now you are left with something that makes you uncomfortable.  Have you discussed w/PS on what is his plan on \u201cfixing\u201d this?  Is he looking to reduce your other breast and use that tissue on the lumpectomy side to try to even things out?  I\u2019m just so sorry you are in the position you are in\u2026doesn\u2019t seem right. Babs \u2013 is your daughter back in town yet?  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hoping she\u2019s home for the holidays\u2026if she\u2019s not yet back, will she be back for good by Thanksgiving? VintageGal \u2013 have you looked into the Blood Builder yet?  I don\u2019t want to \u201cpush\u201d but I know I have such great results from it and so few people know of its existence. I cannot stop telling women about it who have anemia.  It is so gentle and works so well\u2026\u2026. Jeannine \u2013 how close are you to finishing now?  It has to be getting close\u2026..

If you need the 6 treatments, will you now be getting the Neulasta after each chemo?  I would think it necessary given this little bump in the road - your body obviously is not rebounding in the WBC area the way it needs to.  That's just my opinion. Not a good weekend for the Aug 2013 ladies!  Everyone - take good care of yourselves and know that many thoughts and prayers are with you! Lisa",

All in all, I cannot complain.   I feel like crap; feeling like a major flu is never pleasant but knowing how bad things could be and now seeing what's happened w/you and Babs.....I will not complain.  My issues will pass in a couple days and are being managed very well.  I actually felt that way after my first chemo - yes, it was very unpleasant and at times upsetting (the whole \"my mind feels like it has been erased\") but I knew how bad things could be and I felt I never came close to how bad they could be so felt fortunate then as well.  I do find it worrisome, though, to see how we can manage a couple of chemo treatments and/or expansions with little issue and then see what has happened to you and Babs after that..... I know for someone like you being in the hospital must be frustrating!  How are your children handling it?  And the hubby?  And are you bored out of your mind by now?",

Right now....this is our new normal.  Me; I'm bound and determined it will NOT be my normal come July 2014 (my one year anniversary of when this horror show started).  At that time all my therapy and surgeries should be completed and I will make a new normal for myself and look back on this journey in only a couple ways that are positive:  I've met such wonderful, caring women thru this forum -and I doubt I could have kept my sanity without all your help!!! I'm also very thankful to all the medical professionals I've come in contact with; their caring and support has been overwhelming.  Then, of course, my medical team - I can't even put in words how incredibly lucky I've been to have such a group of very experienced, truly caring, and friendly people caring for me. Also, my family, who has been my rock thru all this.  They see all the turmoil nobody else sees, all the crying, all the disgust I have at how my body now looks, all the pain that seems to never stop - and yet they can look beyond all that and give me a hug to make things \"all better\".  I've been blessed - but it still has been a horrible experience I want behind me. OK - now that I've made myself cry over how I've come in contact with so many wonderful people, I'm going to stop before I start bawling my head off and worrying my DH. Hope you all have a great weekend.  Remember, Wrenn - any questions or concerns that you think of over the weekend, let us know and we'll help out any way we can.  ",

I think perhaps you need to leave Mr Google be by himself for a while.  He only causes you anxiety and you don't need that.  Just call tomorrow if you don't hear anything.  And don't be worrying about \"what if I have cancer\" and all the stuff that comes after that.  Not everyone needs chemo and radiation is not always used.  So even if you get bad news, don't' go jumping to conclusions and worrying about what you might not be able to have in your life.  If the news is bad, you'll do what we all have and take it one step at a time, one day at a time, and we'll all be here to support and encourage you along the way.  But just think, you might get such good news that tomorrow evening you'll be laughing and giddy and thinking \"why did I worry myself so much?\".  It's a bad thing going back and forth so try to keep positive and think of getting GOOD news!

The Breast Clinic specializes in these issues and are incredibly caring and informative.  They do the proper tests needed, and then they will go over with you what exactly is the issue with your breasts.  They often times can do all the required testing so you build a repore with these folks that is invaluable. Please check into that.  You have been put on an emotional roller-coaster and I'm sure that is causing you incredible stress.  So try to put an end to that and look into a Breast Clinic asap. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.  We know it is hard - all this waiting - but your situation has been made worse by the doctor you saw and his unprofessional and unqualified staff who give patients information that is not correct.  We all expect, for whatever reason, that doctors and their staffs are completely professional, completely reliable, and completely competent in their field of expertise.  Too many of us have learned, either recently or a long time ago, that is not always the case.  You have options; we all do.  If you have the misfortune of being treated by medical professionals who fall short of complete competency....time to move on. And you want, and deserve, answers. Please keep us updated.  I know it's not much comfort just hearing you should look elsewhere for your care when the stress and breast problems continue but know you always have this forum to vent and ask advise and know you are surrounded by many women who understand what you must be going thru.

Quick history....BMX 8/7/13; 2 nodes removed each side; electrical shock type pain down inside of left arm from armpit to elbow which has worsened considerably; port implant and node removed right side 10/9/13 - same electrical shock type pain now on right inside of arm but SWELLING OF ARM 3 DAYS POST OP - that's what the question relates to. OK - ended up in ER 3 days post op when swelling started. Was a Saturday so ER was only option - surgeon told me to go after elevating my arm for 4 hours did not bring swelling down. The concern was a possible blood clot. ER did US and ran blood tests, no evidence of blood clot (felt stupid being in ER w/swollen arm....but understand the necessity). So, as was my guess right away, it very well may be lymphedema. The ER staff agreed after ruling out the blood clot. I've lost a tremendous amount of time from work w/all the tests, surgeries, long recovery, blah, blah - you all know how that can be. So what exactly does a certified lymphedema therapist do for diagnosis? And what exactly do they do for \"treatment\"? Don't get me wrong, I'm not making light of them in any way.....I just am looking for what it is they do. Are they going to give me exercises to do and could I save myself the hassle of going and ask for someone to print the exercises and give them to me so I can do them at home?

I've already chatted w/Binney on another issue I thought might be LE (nothing that looks or feels like this - this really seems to be everything LE is all about and it quite shocked me). Having had 2 nodes removed at BMX and no LE....I figured getting one more node removed on right side would be a breeze; well, where LE is involved (I knew it would hurt but that's a whole nother issue). And Carol - you probably don't remember me because the LE threads are getting very busy - but I've chatted w/you as well. I value both your opinions. I see doctors at the UW Madison Clinics - I learned from Binney and Carol the importance of a CERTIFIED LE therapist and already sent a message to my doctor that if I was being sent to PT, she best make it a CLT because otherwise I'm not interested. I did that because I first researched what UW Madison Clinics had and they DO have CLT - so that's where I want to go. In so far as measuring before - perhaps they didn't do that because I had no issues after BMX and 2 nodes removed at that time. I don't know....but the issue is in front of me now so I take both your recommendations seriously and will ask for that referral to CLT. Carol - I wouldn't be so foolish (don't mean to belittle anyone that would use an Ace but it's not smart to take matters into your own hands) to do that. I looked some info up and the way I see it...if they don't want BP taken from an arm w/LE...then I'm certainly not going to put any compression on it myself! I'll wait for a specialized therapist to show me what to do and if compression is needed, they can show me what to do. And good call on the \"you can't learn from a video or book\" - you said that very clearly and I understand, and you are right. If I need to take the time off, then that's what I must do. And knowing that early intervention means (hopefully) a quicker \"at home\" therapy plan can be put in place, then time to get that referral and get started. Thank you again Carol and Kathec! I love this forum and how helpful everyone is (and how informative most are!)",

I got a referral today (didn't see the message until I got home and too late to do anything) - I will call them first thing in the morning. From what I've read, the sooner you get treatment, the better. Oh, my arm felt worse this morning so I had my husband do some measurements and sure enough, the swelling is worse than it was on Saturday. Hoping they can get me in quickly so we can get things moving so I can get the best possible outcome! I'll be keeping you all informed. I'll also be throwing questions at you (if you all don't mind) as I am being seen; just to compare notes...... Lisa",

Yes, I'm lazy and wanted it at my fingertips right away. I will do as you suggested. OK, ladies - there are no CLT in our area. I just searched several different sites from the stepup-speakout website and nothing w/in 50 miles of our home. Looks like the closest are in IL or MN - I can't travel that far. I've printed off the list of \"how to see if you therapist is properly trained\" (obviously paraphrased there) and questions to ask - which will come right along w/me to my appointment. I had actually thought, when I went to the UW Madison website that they had CLT's there but apparently I was mistaken because none come up in my search. So, what do you do when you only have access (and we have an HMO insurance - it's great insurance but I know how they operate regarding PT and will not refer to outside providers) to PT therapists who \"have an interest\" in Lymphedema? I don't want anyone messing me up if they don't know what they're doing! As always, thanks all for your help with this. I know your thread would be helpful but there is a lot there on LE that is more advanced and I don't know anything about this (and how exactly it applies to me) so you're coming here to this thread is really appreciated!!!",

I actually feel pretty lucky getting in to see someone on 10/31! It usually takes much longer to get into the clinic for anything PT or Occupational Therapy. I just hope she answers my questions about her qualifications and hours of training to my satisfaction. If not, then I guess I'll have to start making some calls to therapists in the UW clinic to see what their training is and then fight w/the HMO to get a referral there. Ahhh, it never ends......

It was wrong for the doctor to walk out on you like that.  I've read similar, terrible situations by others on this forum and it just shocks me.  My doctor came in, fully explained what she was seeing, why she was concerned, and what her recommendation was.  She then very carefully and completely explained how the stereotatic biopsy would be performed.  That' how a doctor should treat a patient and I'm so sorry yours did not treat you appropriately. Be prepard for a waiting game, though.  That seems to be very common and it's terrible to go thru - but we've all done it and you'll do just fine.  Positive thinking is important, keep life in perspective, don't worry about that which you don't know (please don't sit and fret that you have cancer when there is no evidence of that right now).  They simply see something that they want a closer look at - that's all.  If something comes of this, you'll find out soon enough so don't let it run your life until you know what's happening. Again, my experience is not yours but I think it important each women know the limitations of core needle biopsies (although it's the best we have available at this time) and the false negative percentages.  Information is power! Please keep us updated on how things are proceeding.  My thoughts are with you, Jessica.  Keep strong, do your research, ask questions, be patient, and don't worry yourself over all this.  I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers!",

I have had pain issues since my BMX on 8/7/13 and nobody could really give me answers to what was causing the pain. First, the day of surgery I had an electrical type pain shooting from SNB site down the inner left arm to the elbow area. Now, 9 weeks post op the pain has worsened, goes all the way down into the wrist, is so bad it hurts to run a washcloth over it, hurts to put moisturizer lotion on it, hurts to just extend the arm and really hurts getting a sleeve pulled up that arm. Today is Sunday - this past Wed I had another node removed on right side. Wouldn't it figure - 1 day following surgery that electrical type pain started shooting down that inner arm to the elbow. Today it is now extending about 2 inches beyond the elbow. I'm pretty sure it will end up going down into the wrist and I'll end up w/same pains in that arm that I've been suffering with in the left arm. I contacted my PCP on Thurs when I first felt the pain in my right arm. She did a little research and emailed me that she believed I was suffering from Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. Gave me several options - I've opted to try Lyrica as I've tried this med in the past for chronic headaches (don't like it or any other anti-convulsant - but the pain in the left arm is just getting worse and worse and if it's now starting in the right....I want to do what I can to stop it as soon as possible). You gals seem to be very well informed so I thought I'd turn to you for your thoughts. Did any of you have symptoms like that? Did any of you get relief w/Lyrica and if so, what dosage did you have to go up to before you got relief? What other options have any of you been offered and more importantly, what has WORKED for you? Your help would be greatly appreciated. I swear, I thought after BMX I'd just heal and move on. I read the first page of this thread and it seems that's pretty much what we all figured.....I don't get the lack of info we receive prior to surgery? It made me very angry to sit here hurting w/no known reason as to why and nobody was helping me when I was telling them my symptoms - well, I'm sure you all probably have similar stories..... I'll be watching for replies - I really want to know what others are dealing w/after their doctors tell them they suffer from this syndrome. Have a great night ladies!",

I worry about lymphedema, though, in all I've read.  Can you get it when just having SNB?  Or is it something to worry about when they do more extensive lymph node removal?  Nobody at the hospital told me anything about this so I figured I had no need to worry BUT I've read that blood pressure should not be taken in the arm which is the side MX was done - I had bilateral so I guess I shouldn't worry about that, right?  Interested in what other women know on this; internet can be a little overwhelming and takes too much time to sort thru.  I've found this forum is more informative and gives me info others who have had the same procedure have been told/have gone thru.",

My thoughts went with the later of the above.  The last thing I want to do is \"keep still\" to \"attempt\" to reduce the fluid output and then, once tubes are removed, live my life as normal and end up with fluid building up in the chest and then leading to infection (had TE implanted at time of MX)then either going in for aspiration or having to have the TE surgically removed.  Then all this makes me wonder about lymphedema - if the tubes do come out too soon, could the fluid build up lead to lymphedema?  Did you have fluid buildup after your tubes/drains were removed? I'm so niave I'm almost embarrassed to ask these questions.  But connecting with other women here helps me feel like I can get info so I know what I might/should be asking my doctors.

carol57 - you crack me up with your 20 year old boob description! musical - i know the tube issue and 3 weeks thing is out there.  my PS thinks that these tubes will HAVE to come out next week and they'll start the expansion process at that time to try to take up some of that \"dead\" space in order to minimize any fluid build-up.  Seems there is no concrete medical studies out there that say the tubes MUST be removed at 3 weeks - there are those of us unfortunate ladies who end up on the outside of the norm and have them a little longer.  I'm still on antibiotics while the tubes are in to also minimize the risk of infection.  I want them out, but not if I end up w/infection because they come out too early and then end up gettin the TE's removed.  If that happens, then my future is w/prosthesis - I won't even attempt reconstruction again. ",
