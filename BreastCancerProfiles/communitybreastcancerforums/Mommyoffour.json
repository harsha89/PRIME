Found the ALH during a cosmetic breast reduction. Was offered Tamixofen, started it but then several doctors and friends suggested to consider PBM. I would love to connect w women like me who don't have cancer - have this \u201cpre-cancer\" - and went the PBM route. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
