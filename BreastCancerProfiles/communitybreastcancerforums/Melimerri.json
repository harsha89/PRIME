On the left breast, the radiologist found two lymph nodes.  She said they weren't anything to worry about, but I feel them now and am worried about them.  They aren't exactly in the breast, but more along the side - about 5 inches from my underarm, where the breast meets my side.  Does that make sense? Is it normal to have swollen lymph nodes show up in an ultrasound?  As far as I know, I'm not sick, so I don't know what would make them swell.  The radiologist said that sometimes the lymph nodes under the arms can move and/or swell ... but why?  Has anyone else had something like this?  It's been 3 weeks since the ultrasound, and I still feel them. I go  back in six months to have the biopsied lumps check again, but they won't be checking the left breast/lymph nodes.  Should I go back to my doctor before then to have him order another ultrasound of both breasts? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks, Melissa  Log in to post a reply",

I'm 27, so I guess I do have dense breasts.  Do you know if lymph nodes actually be cancerous?  They showed up as a fuzzy white oval on the ultrasound, and they feel like rounded ovals - very mobile.  Breast issues run in my family and I've had several scares ... So far, I've had an excisional biopsy (at 20) and two core needle biopsies.  I have one lump that is too small to biopsy that we will continue to monitor and then these two lymph nodes, so - needless to say - I worry a lot about breast cancer. ",
