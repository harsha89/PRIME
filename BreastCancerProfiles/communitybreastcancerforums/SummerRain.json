Put them on an hour before the flight and leave them on for two hours after landing. During the trip sometimes we would have elevation changes of 7000 feet in a very short time, so I needed to wear them on those days, too. I am glad I did.",

Get a referral from your doctor and go to a specialist ASAP. If you already have swelling, they should get you in right quick. In the meantime, look up lymphatic drainage self-massage. There are many videos on this, many specifically for breast cancer. (I like MassagebyHeather.) Good luck!",

The muscle tissue in the area is also taking a beating, not just from the radiation, but from the surgery as well. Sneezes or coughs can cause it to tighten up. That can also make it feel like the ribs are effected (which they are, just not in the same way). Often gentle, slow stretches can help.",
