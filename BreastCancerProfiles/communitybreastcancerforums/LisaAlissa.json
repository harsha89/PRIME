My guess is that you're quoting from either a doc's description to you, or from a report or letter. Can you tell us a bit more? What led to the imaging? Was this a routine screening mammogram? Did someone find something they wanted imaged? Did you have a mammogram? More than one? An ultrasound\" an MRI? If you don't have the actual report sent to the doc who ordered the imaging (instead of just a \"patient letter\"), you'll want to get that. The actual report will give you much more information...and with that information, we'll be able to help you sort out what it might mean. In the meantime, \"architectural distortion\" might just mean (for example) that a \"shadow\" was seen, and they can't tell what is causing it. It might mean (for example) that there was a fold in your breast as they were applying compression. They might well be asking you to come back for more imaging so that they can try to sort out what it is (and it could well be nothing!). HTH...but come back and tell us more! LisaAlissa",

I'm wondering if you have the actual reports from your imaging studies (not just the patient letter(s)). If you don't have those reports, you should be able to get copies. We have members here who are also in Canada and are able to get those reports, so I hope you will be able to get them too (if you don't already have them). 2. Can you expand a bit about the timing of your finding the lump, the mammogram, the ultrasound, the perceived growth of the lump, the discharge and any visits with your primary care doc and what any of your docs had to say about any of it. For example, are some of these things some time after your imaging studies and visits with your doc? 3. How did you leave it with your pcp? What are you supposed to do if things don't change or if they get worse? When are you supposed to do it? If you don't have a plan with your doc that you're satisfied with, making a plan would be my first step. But we can be more helpful with a bit more background from you. Again, I'm so sorry that you're having to deal with all of this, LisaAlissa",

Some will provide you with a patient portal access, some will mail to you, some will want you to pick up and others want to send the images/reports only to the ordering doc and have you get them from him/her. No way of knowing until you ask! ;-) Once you know when your images/reports will be available, and how, follow up if there is any delay. One thing is should mention...you said \"I have spent hours reading these boards and so appreciate everyone sharing their stories.

But this is a time when your mind and interior self-talk can take you to dark places from time to time. And it sounds like one of those times for you is when you're getting put together for the day and are \"face-to-lump,\" as it were. You need to develop your own self-talk that you repeat to yourself in these situations. Almost a mantra that you edit as you go along. Maybe even write it down and edit it from time to time. For now, I'd suggest that starting with a burst of fierce self-pride is in order at those moments! (Take \"that\" you lump! Then include the things you've done so far.) You've done/are doing all of the things you're supposed to do when faced with breast oddities. You saw your doctor, you're proceeding forward with a plan (or a proto-plan if you're still developing a plan). [You're _____________] It (the lump) has had it's day and is on it's way out. Sniff dismissively and turn away from it to face the rest of your day. (If you're religious or spiritual, this is a moment to turn it over to your higher power for the day.) The fill-in the blank is for whatever is on your list to do. Making an appointment for a second opinion? Making lists of pre-surgery things to do. Getting ready for an appointment with a 2nd opinion doc? Whatever is on your cancer-related agenda. Even make lists of what is next. Whatever it is. You've heard that you're on a roller coaster? Like any roller coaster, when you're at the \"top\" before the big drop, your mood and intention can make a big difference in how you feel during the ride. Although you'll end up at the bottom of the drop no matter what you do. If you pull back and try to avoid the ride, you'll feel anxious, unhappy and possibly ill-ish as the roller coaster proceeds (and it proceeds no matter what you do!). If you're saying \"yeah! here we go! You enjoy the ride with a burst of enthusiasm and adreneline. You can feel fierce, and lean forward into the fall and feel exhilarated. I'm not suggesting that cancer treatment is going to feel good, but you can let yourself feel pride that you're treating that lump in the best way possible for you and your family(? I haven't read back over all your posts, so don't know your personal situation). And you can refuse to let it make you feel miserable. Not letting cancer take over your life while you're waiting for treatment to begin is a way to feel better about yourself. Hmph to cancer. You're doing all the things you're supposed to do. It can't have the rest of your day/life. (There will be days when cancer treatment needs to be the focus of the day, but that's not today!) As Mandy and Estela suggested, prayer or guided meditations can be helpful. If you need some meditations, UCLA's MARC (Mindfulness Awareness Research Center) has some free guided meditations \"here.\" (I participated in some of their research on the effectiveness of guided meditation for breast cancer survivors at MARC and found it helpful.) But do the things that require your attention and focus. So that your focus will be on the things that you'd like to do as much as possible. HTH, LisaAlissa",

Any way to stop obsessing besides taking a little xanax? I have some and have used it for anxiety issues in the past.I don't know how to make it to 6 days from now and then thinking about waking up after the exision and hearing bad news....my heart is jumping nearly out of my chest right now.\" Sounds like you need to deal with both your thoughts and your physical reactions. I've got a few suggestions, but first a question dealing with the physical. Are you hyperventilating? If so, that can initiate a negative feedback loop that will make your heart race & your breathing get even faster & shallower. If you're doing that, you need to interrupt that feedback loop. It's going to sound a little silly (unless you've done it before!), but get a small brown paper bag and gather the opening so that there's just a small opening (finger or pencil sized). Then blow into the bag (like a balloon), then inhale from the bag. Just keep that paper bag expanding & collapsing with each breath. Try to make each breath in & out a little longer than the one before it. While you're doing that, think at your heart \"slow, slow, slow.\"  When your breathing has calmed down, put the bag away. The next bit addresses your thoughts.  Here's an example of how it can work.  On a roller coaster. If you try to \"hold back\" at the top of the coaster, it tends to be really scary as you go down. If you think yourself \"down, down, faster, faster,\" anticipating the motion, it tends to be more exhilarating than scary. No matter what you do, your excisional biopsy isn't going to be exhilarating, but your \"self-talk\" can affect how you feel about it.  In my roller coaster example, I worked on evoking \"anticipation of a treat\" as the emotion I used to avoid the \"scary.\"   What I'd suggest here are that you should try to evoke pride that you're vigilant about your health screenings (and any follow-up needed) and competent (in handling the risk factors and screenings). Whenever you start to obsess, you need to read through/think through some statements/affirmations that feel true to you.  Here's a possible script for you (but you need to edit/write it so that they all feel true to you): HTH, LisaAlissa ",

However in the stepped screening/diagnostic procedure the initial mammogram--sometimes referred to as the screening mammogram (and in some places as an \"annual\" or \"regular\" mammogram) merely identifies those who should continue on to a diagnostic work up. That work up can be composed of any (or many of) various elements: ultrasound, mammogram, mri, and other, more esoteric scanning modalities. A mammogram which is used as a part of this \"second level screen\" or diagnostic work up is referred to as a \"diagnostic mammogram \" and usually involves additional views selected based on what was seen in the initial/screening mammogram. So in that sense, no, not all mammograms are diagnostic mammograms.  HTH (someone), LisaAlissa",

You asked for advice...  Start making a list of your questions, so that you can get them answered when you see your doctor.  And try not to worry...no one knows anything that you should be worried about, yet.  It sounds as if your medical team is practicing careful preventative medicine--just as you should want them to!

There are some larger calcifications which tend to be scattered and unassociated with BC. I don't really have any opinion on the report your got from your doc. Really, nothing you've said suggests you have BC. And, in fact, 80% of those who have biopsies get a B9 result. There's no reason to borrow trouble until (unless!!!) you get a BC diagnosis.

If a report doesn't come in, if something is misfiled, someone could not get (potentially) life-saving information. No news is not necessarily good news! And I'd go further than that. Everytime you have a test or are expecting a report, I'd ask for a date when it should be available, which you can confirm if the test/procedure generating the report is done at another facility. Some practices will put such reports on their patient portal for you...which is another way to monitor whether or not it's been received when due. In any case, add it to your calendar and follow up on the report when it's supposed to be in! HTH (and that your results, when they're in, are wonderful), LisaAlissa",

I discovered that my insurance company would not approve an MRI before a BX.  They required a positive BX before approving an MRI, but once there'd been a positive BX, they would approve an MRI before surgery. So the option that your docs mentioned (BX or MRI next) may really be an option that belongs to your insurance company (unless you want to pay yourself).  HTH, LisaAlissa",

Those panic-y flight or fight feelings are intended (from an evolutionary perspective) to make you do the things you need to do to survive when faced with an imminent threat to life & limb (\"here comes the sabertooth tiger,\" sort of threat). You are facing a different sort of threat here, but running (however healthy, from a fitness perspective) isn't going to help.

I'll start: If you haven't gotten a copy of the BCO Pathology Booklet from one of your docs (some docs hand them out, some don't--mine did), print out a copy from \"here.\" Read through it before you meet with your doc/nurse navigator to discuss your pathology, and get their help filling out the details.

If it's faint enough that two of the docs you've seen couldn't even find it, I'm wondering if you've been feeling on the spot all of this time. It could cause skin irritation that would get bigger as time goes on. If I thought that was going on with me, I'd probably cover the spot with something (so that I couldn't rub/irritate it) and give it some time. I wouldn't think that this is IBC...take a look at \"this description of Inflamatory Breast Cancer\" from the main BCO site. As you read that and follow the links there you will see things like \"fast moving,\" \"aggressive,\" \"overnight visible changes.\" So five months for a faint, barely-perceptible redness to expand to 1.5 inches doesn't seem to make IBC a likely diagnosis for you. Here's hoping that the redness abates very soon! LisaAlissa etc: spelling",

There are books and websites which may provide useful information for you. Consider asking your parent or other trusted adult in your life if they recommend either of these for you to take a look at: 1. Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book (the first 50 pages or so) discusses healthy breasts and breast development. Because most of the book focuses on breast cancer (about 640 pages), I wouldn't recommend you purchase it, but you might find it in a local library, and take a look through that first section, \"The Healthy Breast and Common Problems.\" 2. The website about the Boston Women's Health Collective book \"Our Bodies Our Selves\" has a discussion of breast development, but also has a link to galleries showing a small part of the vast variation in how \"normal\" breasts look. The gallery showing breasts of women who have not been pregnant (clinical photos, not porn) is 12 pages long. You'll see breasts of all types there, including some where one breast points up and the other down. I'd be surprised if you didn't feel better after taking a look at the gallery... HTH, LisaAlissa",

Do you have a copy of the report from that screening test? If not, be sure to ask for it. Chances are that it includes a BIRADs score. My guess is that your radiologists \"low-risk\" comment reflects a lower-range BIRADs score on that report. Perhaps the minimum that still calls for a biopsy? Who knows? (Get a copy of report...) I hear \"Good that you had the biopsy\" as a compliment to you and your doc. Means you've done the best you can to care for your health! However unlikely, you and your docs have been proactive (so that if you're in the 20% you'll be treated promptly). Sounds like a compliment to the both of you from the radiologist!

There always seem to be breast cancer-related studies that can't reach the level of significance because they don't have enough study participants. The Army addresses that need. The idea is that a pool of women (both with and without breast cancer) are willing to receive emails about the need for volunteers for screened research studies. When you receive an email, it tells you what's needed and where. If it's a study that you'd be interested in, then you reply to the email and they give your contact details to the researcher. It's something we can do (and that our family & friends who don't have BC can do) to help advance BC research. I've been getting their emails since 2008...it isn't oppressive, since the studies are \"approved\" by the Dr. Susan Love organization before they are sent. They were (are) looking for a million members. They're still under 400,000. We can boost that number! Are you currently a member?

If there are things you should be doing now, which you haven't yet done, then yes, worry and concern can be helpful (to prod you to do them). But there's very little that you can (or should) do at this point. I can think of only a couple: 1. If you don't have a copy of the imaging reports yet, I'd ask for a copy.

Once you have the report, and a medical team you're happy with, there really isn't anything else for you to do at this point, other than show up for your biopsy. So let me add a third thing: 3.

I noticed that you said: \"I dont feel any lumps but I do know that there is such a thing as duct cancer I think. I'm going crazy and all I can think is about cancer.\" There certainly is such a thing as duct cancer. It's called ductal carcinoma in situ (aka DCIS) and is the very, very earliest kind of breast cancer. So early that it is Stage 0. It is absolutely the most treatable kind of cancer. So try not to freak out. \"Here\" is information about how ductal cancer can develop (from normal cells through various other stages). Your ductogram is a special kind of mammogram which is used when there is a discharge to evaluate. \"Here\" is a paper on the NIH site about ductograms. I'm not sure what would come after a ductogram...a biopsy? Absent a microscopic examination of cells I don't think there can be a cancer diagnosis. Will there be a pathology report as a part of the ductogram results? Maybe based on an examination of the discharged fluid? It's entirely possible that the result of the ductogram will be either a recommendation of biopsy or not. It sounds like you're in very good hands. And there isn't anything you could be doing (or not doing) or thinking (or not thinking) that will have any effect on the outcome of the ductogram. I know you'll still worry, but try not to borrow trouble that isn't your yet. There's every chance that this isn't cancer. (Approximately 80% of biopsies have benign results. And you haven't even been sent for a biopsy yet! Do your darndest to distract yourself. Create your own mantra...something like: I have a good medical team. They're doing the things they should. There's nothing I should be doing (or thinking) which can affect the results. So I'll ______________. Fill in the blank with things that will distract you. Seeing the new StarWars movie, reading a book, baking a cake. Things you do that you can focus on. There's no sense spoiling the joy of today with problems that may never come.

Excisional biopsy vs. other biopsy techniques.  Your OP speaks of an excisional biopsy, but if you haven't seen the surgeon (and they haven't seen you) there's really no way of knowing what sort of biopsy they will want.  S/he may well suggest (for example) a stereotactic needle or core biopsy, which is less invasive than an excisional biopsy.     2.  See the Surgeon first/let them order MRI.  I'd see the surgeon first, and discuss it with him (or her).  Find out if the results of an MRI would change the next steps.  Could be (for example) that whatever the MRI showed, a stereotactically-guided core biopsy would be the \"next step.\"  In that case, perhaps there is no need for the MRI before the biopsy.  If you will be having an excisional biopsy, then the surgeon may well want to have a pre-surgical MRI (to ID any other sites which should also receive surgical attention). Separately, since the surgeon is the one who would be using the MRI results (instead of your gynecologist), allow them to order the study they would find most useful from the provider that they've had best results with. You'd hate to get an MRI order by your gynecologist and then have it not be the exact study that the surgeon wants.  3. Check your insurance before the MRI study.  Your surgeon's office probably has someone who gets \"pre-approvals\" and they should check coverage for your MRI (before the study).  Even if your insurance doesn't require \"pre-approval\" (mine doesn't) most insurance policies only cover \"medically necessary\" procedures.  You want to get assurance from your insurer that they won't conclude that an MRI isn't medically necessary.  Mine wouldn't cover an MRI without a prior positive biopsy.  However they were happy to cover it as a pre-surgical procedure (before my lumpectomy).  4.  Add MRI to future screenings. If the biopsy is negative, then discuss with your gynecologist (or whatever doctor is in charge of your breast screenings) whether or how MRI's should be added to your future routine screenings.  The guidelines have been changing (I think) about what additional modalities should be added to address (for example) dense breasts.  You may want to review some of the latest guidelines in preparation for that conversation. Just a couple of additional considerations.  Hope they help as you work through this process.  I'm just sorry that you have to go through it at all. Hang in there!   LisaAlissa",

For example, it should say how many samples they took, and probably describe their size and that they sent them to the pathologist/pathology lab. Hopefully it will say they did whatever the order said they should do. 3. a pathology report (and there may be interim reports before the final report) that says what they got, again describing the samples.

I don't have any idea if frankincense helps or not...but there are lots of different things that get suggested. The only thing I want to add is to be sure that your medical oncologist knows about all of the \"extras\" you add. Occasionally there will be one or the other that the MO will want you to avoid, based on whatever they're prescribing at the time. For example, I was drinking lots of coca-cola at the time (not because I thought it would help w/ cancer...just because.) and I was asked to stop all caffeine while I was on a particular drug. Apparently caffeine can block a cell site that particular drug needed to work properly. So there may be something that they don't want you to use either at all, or during the duration of a particular treatment. HTH, LisaAlissa Etc: spelling",

They may want to make sure you come in so that they can reassure you that all is well, and discuss a future screening schedule. There might be something they still want to take a look at \"pathologically\" (i.e., with a biopsy). Or there might be something else. There's simply no way to know. And there's no reason to borrow trouble that isn't yours! I don't know if you've seen the flow chart showing how women go through the screening process from the Imaginis site, but I think it might be helpful:  On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. Your doc found \"something\" that they want to take a closer look at during your routine screening mammogram, so they asked you to come back for additional imaging (a diagnostic workup). That's what you've already done. You don't know if you're going to be in the 25% who are sent on to biopsy. Or--more likely--the 75% who are returned to either routine screening or a more frequent screening schedule. There's no reason to assume that you'll be in the 25%! For example, one of the possibilities for your appointment is that you'll be discussing why they want to have more frequent screening for a while...or they could just want to discuss what they saw (and what it means/doesn't mean before returning you to routine screening. You will not be told you have cancer at this appointment. You will have to go through another step (biopsy)...and of the people who are sent on to biopsy (not yet your category) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. I know it's easy to worry, but really. Try not to borrow trouble that isn't yours yet. When your mind turns to worry, turn your thoughts to something you enjoy and that requires your focus. Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

It's certainly news on one wants to get, but you're in the right place to discuss \"what now.\" First of all, cancel the mastectomy if you don't feel ready yet. And it doesn't sound like you do. Tell them you want a second pathology opinion before surgery. Unless it was inflamatory BC, you have time. (What does your pathology report say?) There is no reason to rush to have surgery. And yes, a biopsy can be wrong,but it's unlikely. However there is no reason that you can't get a second pathology opinion. The specimens & slides taken from your biopsy can be sent to another pathologist. You'll need to identify a specialist pathology practice. Presumably at a specialist breast center/NCIC-designated cancer center or something like that. Your doctor should be able to help you to identify a good place for a second opinion. You probably don't need a second biopsy. But if the second pathology group wants to see more, then that would be something to consider. Most of us don't feel sick when diagnosed. It's part of what makes this whole breast cancer \"thing\" seem so unreal. And in fact, we feel fine until we have surgery or treatments. They're what make us feel \"ill.\" Finally, you may want to meet with a medical oncologist before you have surgery. Increasingly they're suggesting neo-adjuvent chemo to shrink the existing cancer. So slow down the train. Get copies of your procedure reports, pathology reports and imaging reports. Get a second path opinion, meet with a medical oncologist and make a considered, deliberate plan. You have time, and you should get to make the decisions. Come back and tell us more... HTH, LisaAlissa",

(If you want, ask your derm for advice about how best to moisurize.) 2. Ask your derm what signs or symptoms you should watch for (since you're still worried about the potential development of Paget's) and how often you should check for those signs/symptoms. And when such signs or symptoms would definitely have manifested if you currently have Pagets (remembering that you have at least four medical opinions so far that you don't). Then put periodic \"check by\" dates in your calendar. And try to ignore the issue, as you've got it scheduled & handled! 3. Finally, don't let a disease you probably don't have steal a minute of happiness from you! If you remain anxious, check out the \"Anxiety\" thread. HTH, LisaAlissa",

But you're in the right place to find yourself and put the pieces back together... You said you you're not sure if time is a big factor and you can't wait. That's a very common feeling. (At one time--long, long ago--they did biopsies under general anesthesia, had pathologists do a preliminary report on the biopsy and if it was positive did a mastectomy before waking the patient up.) So women laid down not knowing if they would have a breast when they woke up!!) While that doesn't happen any more, a vestige of that sense of urgency still survives... So if you're worried, ask your doc \"How long have I had these tumors? How long can I have to make treatment plans, get any second opinions and meet with a medical oncologist before the delay in surgery might have an adverse effect on me?\" You are likely to get answers in the \"years\" range (I was told 7-10 years, but YMMV). At any rate, the chances are very good that you've had these cancers for a very, very, long time. And given that, it's hard to see how a delay of weeks--or even a couple of months will be a bad thing. Especially given that you'll be using that time to have consultations and make treatment plans. You might well want to travel for second opinions at large breast cancer centers. Hang in there, LisaAlissa",

I can't help you with reconstruction decisions, but there are certainly lots of experts around the country. (I recall reading that there is a group in New Orleans, LA which has gotten raves from patients from all over.) Be sure that the plastic surgeon you are working with has done lots and lots of whatever version of reconstruction you want! It's not too early to be looking into the sort of reconstruction you want, then finding someone who considers that their specialty. On the obsessing. In a very large sense, Nothing has changed because of your diagnosis. You may still live to be 100. Or you might be hit by a bus (tomorrow!). None of us come with an expiration date on our toe. All we can do is live the days we're given, one at a time. The only time we have (or have ever had!) is the moment we're in. So try to appreciate the joys the current moment/day can offer you, instead of worrying about days that aren't yet here. Yes, plan.

The test is fairly expensive (thousands), so you'll want to make sure your insurance company will cover it.  The lab is very good about checking coverage and letting you decide whether or not to proceed if your insurance company declines coverage. Ask your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor.  They will help you sort through your risk profile, which may help determine whether your insurance will cover the test.  In my case, my doctor suggested testing & referred me to a counselor.  When I made an appointment, the counselor sent materials to allow me to gather the family information she needed.  I gathered and submitted on schedule (before the appointment) so that she would have a chance to analyze before the appointment.  When we met, she reviewed my risk profile with me and recommended testing.  The insurance person on staff contacted my insurance company to get pre-approval.  I came in for a separate blood draw and then waited.  When the test results were back, I had another appointment with the counselor to review results.  Mine were negative based on then-current knowledge.   There are other family cancers that can relate to the BC gene risks.  And if your family doesn't have many female members (or if they died at early ages from other causes), the lack of relevant familial cancers may not rule out the possibility of familial risk.  Note that for these purposes, any cancer before age 50 is considered \"early.\"  So I see why your doctor suggests testing to you. You may want to check the FORCE web site (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered).  They are an organization which focuses on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.  There's lots of information there about the sorts of questions you raise. The mechanics of the test are trivial.  The rest of it (emotional content and potential suggested prophylactic care) is anything but. My very best wishes to you. LisaAlissa ",

Comments from strangers, discussions of BC when you'd rather talk about anything else, family members who are actually adding to your emotional burden! Ugh. Coming here to tell us about it is a great strategy. But I have a few other thoughts, depending on what you want to do. And you might have different things you want to do with various people. So here are a few suggestions for some of the scenarios you mentioned. My suggestion is that you think through what sorts of responses you want to give so that you're not thinking \"darn, I should have said______,\" when it happens again: 1. Family members who want you (or your wife) to support others. Certainly do if you like, but that should be your call. And it sounds as if it's not something that you want to do! So what could you say to your parents? How about: you're not feeling up to supporting others just yet. So please don't pass along our contact information (or details about our treatment/progress) without talking with us first. There are, however, a few sources of support you can suggest, for example, \"Reach to Recovery\" (an American Cancer Society program) has volunteers who have been trained to talk with BC patients. (They would be better at this than we would be, since we haven't been trained, and the BC we're dealing with is only one of many different kinds of BC.) Or suggest they refer their friends to BC.org, if they're computer users. If they find someone who needs support your parents should call you to see if you have support suggestions that your parents can pass along. Ask your parents not to share details about your healthcare with others. It's not that you're ashamed (why would you be?) but some things are private--you want to be able to share with your family without thinking that you've published information in your local newspaper! 2. People who have been referred to you for support (without your prior consent). I'm so sorry, but I/we haven't been trained to supply support to (other) BC patients, and we aren't comfortable in that role. Your BC may be very different than anything we're familiar with, so we aren't even comfortable discussing our experiences with you. May we suggest ____________________ (fill in the blank with a Reach to Recovery volunteer line, or a local Gilda's Club, or this on-line community, or whatever local resources seem best to you, for example a social worker at their cancer treatment center!). 3. People who want to talk about cancer. You don't have to engage in discussions about cancer. When asked how you are, give them the standard social response, \"fine, and you?\" (maybe they don't know about your cancer?) and then ask them about something else. For adults & social acquaintences, if they persist and try to initiate a discussion of your cancer, may I suggest a long stare, and then a question to them about something else--current movie, book, recent event in the news, whatever. If they keep pushing the cancer discussion, you have to up your response, perhaps something like: \"Why would you think I'd want to discuss that?\", together with another firm gaze. If an immediate change in topic or an apology is not forthcoming, then I'd turn and walk away. If you encounter that person again, just pretend that the entire episode never happened! You might want to vary your responses, depending on who is asking. I managed to keep the details of my treatment very private (my family was several states away when I was in active treatment), but my sister and I did deal with a four-year period when we wore very visible back braces and received no end of questions. Often from total strangers. And children (of various ages). And friends/relatives. And social acquaintances. We varied our responses depending on who was asking. For strangers on the street (they really did walk up to us and ask!!!!), if we were together, we'd say things like \"we were born joined at the spine and had to be separated.\" Alone, it might be \"I was born without a spine and had to have one installed!\"--then keep walking! (Strangers who ask rude questions deserve whatever they get!) For small children 3-6 or so, something kind, innocuous and age appropriate. You'll need to establish your own categories and plan your responses...that way you won't be caught off-guard, and can simply move on. Or come here and vent...you'll find a number of threads which are basically for venting. For example, the thread \"The dumbest things people have said to you/about you\" is a longstanding thread (begun in 2009!) and still usually on the active threads page--after 305 pages! Even though the original poster has deleted her posts it's still a great place to go to share the absurdity of the comments we all get! HTH, LisaAlissa P.S.: When you've had it with people staying stupid stuff...there is the other side: \"The most encouraging things said to you during your journey.\"   ",

If they don't suggest a biopsy at this time, they could advise you about what sort of things you should be looking for during the wait for the recommended follow-up imaging. Things that should send you back sooner than the next scheduled imaging. Or they could refer you to a breast specialist if the two of you decide that's warranted. In any case, you shouldn't spend six months worrying yourself silly. Try some \"mindfulness\" meditations (there are some free ones on-line from UCLA or you may be able to find in-person sessions locally). HTH, LisaAlissa ",

That's why they were told to return in 6 mo. for additional imaging--so that those cancers would be found! And they were. Ninety-eight percent of those with BIRADS 3 either never came here or told us their good news after their 6-month follow-up and left. They aren't still posting on a breast cancer site. They've returned to their normal lives! \" I am planning on starting a family with my husband this year, and I just want to be sure that all is well with me and my body before even thinking about having children. \" On waiting to start a family. There are no guarantees. No one can promise you that your future (near or far term) has no \"bad\" surprises. There's always a chance that the future will hold something bad, so If you wait until you're sure that it won't, you simply won't have a family. That's a call for you and your husband.

I think there is at least one large cancer center in Seattle. Maybe more? At any rate, it sounds to me like you need to pause this train and get your hands on the reigns (to thoroughly mix my metaphors!) You need to have confidence that your surgeon (and your entire treatment team's leaders) keep themselves informed on all of the latest developments in breast cancer treatment. And perhaps you'll discover that the 2nd opinion team would proceed in the same way and you'll regain confidence in your local surgeon? Alternatively, you might choose to travel for portions of your treatment. Large regional cancer centers are accustomed to treating patients who travel to obtain care. And they often are willing to coordinate ongoing care with a local medical oncologist/radiation oncologist as needed. If your primary care doc can't help, do some research and call a larger center directly. They take calls from patients all the time. They'll tell you want records/tests they'll want to review and when they can see you. My very best wishes! LisaAlissa ",

Ok, what you're saying in your most recent post (\"Invasive Ductal Carcinoma with DCIS\") is significantly different than \"just DCIS.\" Generally speaking, unless it's a \"micro invasion,\" they will plan the treatment in response to the IDC, instead of the DCIS. Is this from a new/updated pathology report? It's surprising that your doc would say \"just DCIS\"...and yes, the path report may include additional info. For example, the ER/PR status of the tumor. It sounds like you need to start collecting copies of things. Imaging reports, imaging on disc, test orders & test results, procedure orders and procedure reports.

It's from the Imaginis site, which has additional info about the screening process:  On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. You'll notice that your lump was found during a routine screening mammogram, and your doctor referred you for a diagnostic workup--and then for a biopsy. Of the 25% who are sent on to biopsy (your category) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. That you've done this twice in four years doesn't mean a thing. Look at the chart. For every ten women screened, one of them will be sent on for a diagnostic workup. Given that you're screened every year (for how many years? so how many screening mammograms over your lifetime?), it would be surprising if it wasn't each of us sent on every now and then. Similarly, of twenty women who are sent on for a diagnostic workup, five of them will be sent on for biopsy, but only one of those five will have a cancer diagnosis. You're still going through well-woman screening at this point. As you work your way through the screening process, a very large majority are \"tossed out\" at every stage--including the stage you're at. BTW, when reading on the BCO boards, it's easy to get a skewed version of your odds...the women who were \"dropped out\" of the diagnostic process don't continue to post here. So you have the people who were unlucky enough to advance all the way through the screening process who continue to post. And there's no reason to think that you will be here for very long either.  Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

Further, some of the possible family risks may relate to other cancer types that need other screening modalities.

You may also be confusing Stage (DCIS is always Stage 0) and Grade, which identifies how different the cells are from normal and how quickly they divide. Grade would be 1, 2 or 3, but the Stage would remain zero. Even with DCIS (Stage 0) radiation might be recommended for you. It was for me. Stage 0, Grade 3. About your costs, call your radiation oncologist's office and ask for an appointment with their insurance/billing person, so that you can clearly understand what your costs will be and how and when they will expect any payment from you. Depending on your costs to-date (for surgery, diagnosis and testing) you may be getting close to your annual \"maximum out-of-pocket costs.\" Many insurance policies pay 100% once you've paid your maximum out of pocket costs. So it's possible that your costs for radiation (and other treatments this year) will be minimal. But the doctor's office should be able to help you sort out what you can expect. If you'll be having an appointment with them, ask what they would like you to bring: your insurance cards, the book describing your benefits, etc. HTH, LisaAlissa",

Your report has lots of good things in it! Low grade nuclear=cells that aren't dividing fast. Rare microcalcifications=not very many microcalcifications. Microcalcifications were described to me as the skeletons of dead cancer cells, typically killed because they crowded themselves to death! For you to have not very many microcalcifications is a good thing! Because your tumor is estrogen positive (that is, fed by estrogen), you might be able to treat it with an anti-estrogen drug, although if it is only 1% that may affect whether your MO will suggest such a drug. Tamoxifen is the only approved drug for pre-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (although it can also be used by the post-menopausal). Aromatase Inhibitors are drugs that can only be used for post-menopausal women. You should take someone with you to the initial appointments with both the RO and the MO (and perhaps record those consultations as well). You'll want to find out all you can about why they each suggest the treatments they discuss with you. The benefit the treatment would offer, potential side-effects, etc. Each cancer treatment center will handle its billing however it likes (as long as it works for the insurers as well). It might be a single price for the entire series of radiation. Or it might be separate amounts for each treatment. You'll want to discuss that with your RO. HTH, LisaAlissa",

It's how almost every encounter with a medical professional begins. And those medical professionals want a real response--generally with details. Over the course of our treatment, we become trained by our various caregivers that this is what's being asked by the words \"how are you\" (or any of the many similar phrases). But this isn't what is usually meant in the work environment. (Unless you're discussing things like any accommodations you need as you return to work, or your return to full-time status.) Your anger (and all of the rest of the perfectly understandable negative emotions) is in response to your sense that your co-workers are asking you inappropriate questions or not acknowledging the very real health problems you've been dealing with. 2. social acknowledgement--I'm here and I see you. Do you see me too? Do you need anything from me? For this, no one is really asking about your health/emotional state. So feel free to say \"fine, and you?\" In this context, unless you have an immediate need (for instance, you've just dropped the files you're carrying or tripped over a threshhold and need help rising from the ground) or are going to miss a deadline that's going to affect them, or need something from they can help with that affects your work, just blurt out the usual social acknowledgement. If they aren't really inquiring about your health, they will just move on with their day, or discuss any work-related concern they have. If you respond with something other that the expected reciprocal acknowledgement, their \"what's wrong\" response is not asking about your health. They're asking about your situational state (with respect to your relationship). As in, why isn't it \"fine.\" They're looking for info about their own work life. Are you going to make their project late by not coming through with your part of it? Are you going to miss a meeting? Whatever it is. If someone responds with something like, \"no, really, how are you?\" they're disclaiming the social acknowledgement meaning and really asking about your health/emotional state. You get to decide (or course) how much you are willing to tell, to whom you are willing to tell it and where/when you disclose whatever you choose to share. Me, I try to keep those things out of the office situation. So...something like \"let's have lunch, and I'll tell you about it...\" or \"let's take a walk instead of a coffee break...and I'll tell you what I've been doing.\" But mostly, in the work environment, you should assume that they are asking in the social acknowledgment sense. Most of your co-workers will be focused on the work of the day or their own concerns. Unless it impinges on them, they are unlikely to be thinking about the traumatic events you've been dealing with. So don't take it as a slam. Instead, consider using the work environment as a place where you can step away from BC as much as possible. A place where neither you nor they will focus on your BC and it's treatment. Bring BC into your work life only to the extent that it will affect your work performance or require an accommodation to perform your work. HTH, LisaAlissa",

That way you won't be worrying if two weeks is what should be expected (for example) or that you have to get results from her MO (or her PCP or from a patient portal somewhere) or whatever. For now, call the imaging facility, tell them you forgot to ask, and then find out who they are sending the report to (not just a \"patient letter\") and how you can get a copy of both that and a disc with the images.

It sounds like that is your family physician. A medical oncologist is an internist with a sub-speciality in cancer care. A MO will often assume that coordinator role while you are in active cancer treatment. And then return you to your usual PCP with a post-cancer care plan when active treatment ends. You may want to discuss who will take your \"team lead\" role while you're in cancer treatment with your family physician. Some MO prefer to be a part of the team, but not take the lead role. Others will want to be the lead. Your family physician may well have some thoughts on how to manage all of this. I think your instinct to see a MO sooner, rather than later, is a good one.

The reason there wasn't any comparison on the first--is that it was the first. Nothing that they could compare it to! Now, though, there's an older imaging study, and they want to look at the two of them together to see any changes over time. They will always want all of the mammogram images they can get there hands on. 2. A sonogram can be very normal. For example, if you have \"dense breasts,\" some imaging centers always want to do a follow up ultrasound, as ultrasounds can see things that mammograms can't (and vice-versa). \"Density\" refers to how clear an image they can get on mammogram. If there's a lot of white on the image, it's hard to see the sorts of changes they worry about. So a sonogram can help them get another view. (I had a radiologist who was one of the early researchers in combining ultrasounds with mammograms for routine screening. Had both for 12 years before linear microcalcifications showed (for the first time), leading to my DCIS diagnosis.) 3. They've told you they've seen \"something.\" But they clearly want to know a bit more about it. How does it look on sonogram? Was it there when you had your first mammogram? If so, has it changed since then? Right now, you're still in standard \"well-woman\" screening procedures. Just go with the flow. Make some calls and see if you can't get the earlier mammogram images to your docs asap. The following chart from the Imaginis site (which has additional info about the screening process) may be helpful:  On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. Your doc found \"something\" that they want to take a closer look at during your routine screeening mammogram, so they've asked you to come back for additional imaging (a diagnostic workup). So you are in the 10% of people who have screening mammograms who are asked back. Of all of those who are sent on to a diagnostic workup (where you are), only 25% are sent on to a biopsy--that is, 75% people \"fall out\" of the screen at that point. You may be told that you need to return to your routine screening schedule...or that they would like to see you again \"sooner\" so that can see if \"whatever-it-is\" is stable. Of the 25% who are sent on to biopsy (not your category yet!) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. You're early in the screening process. There are at least two distinct layers of screening you'd have to get through before you could even have the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. I know it's easy to worry, but really. Try not to borrow trouble that isn't yours yet. Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

Whether positive or negative. The thought is that they need to discuss the implications, whether positive or negative, and what follow-up treatment (or screening) is warranted. I think that the offices that do that are concerned that if they give results over the phone that they won't be able to give you information that they think is important, or to answer your questions. I'm not clear whether you're dealing with the same office as before, or if the surgeon's office is not the one where the nurse called you earlier. If it's the same medical practice, I understand your concern, given the fact that you got results via telephone earlier. If they have a diferent policy for the first US you had, vs your most recent test, they should have made it clear at the time of the test that you wouldn't be able to receive the results over the phone. If it's the same practice, I'd be complaining to your doc's office (I'd start with the office manager on this, since you want to use your time with the doc to discuss your situation--whatever it is!) about how this was handled. The result of what they've done is to make you conclude that your result is bad, without giving you any information about how bad or how whatever-it-is will be handled. What a really, really dreadful way to treat patients! You can't know what it really is until they tell you. Maybe negative, might be a high-risk situation that they want to monitor closely? You just can't know until they tell you, and there's no sense in letting yourself be miserable over what you don't know.

I have noticed that Walter Reed National MIlitary Medical Center has a Breast Care and Research Center of Excellence. All Active Duty, Dependents, Retirees, and their family members are eligible for care there. Maybe you could arrange for a second opinion there. Or even a revision/reconstruction surgery. Undoubtedly they will want to see your pathology. If Walter Reed is asking for it, you might get more attention from your base hospital. You might also be able to arrange for help with transportation. But whatever happens, you do want to chase the \"chain of custody\" of your breast tissue. Get to an administrator, with the surgery report in hand. Point out that the tissue was to be sent to pathology within 48 hours. So where is the check-in report from the pathology department? Please let us know how you are doing. LisaAlissa",

Sounds like you have a careful PCP, who's sending you through the standard well-woman checks with your findings. First of all, stop spending time with that \"quack, Dr. Google!\" Half the time the details are wrong, outdated or simply don't apply to you!) Just go with the flow. Your odds (of not having cancer) remain pretty good. Here's a flow chart showing how women go through the screening process from the Imaginis site, which has additional info about the screening process:  On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. Your doc found \"something\" that they want to take a closer look at during your routine screening mammogram, so they asked you to come back for additional imaging (a diagnostic workup). Unfortunately, you didn't \"fall out\" of the screen at that point. Of the people who are sent on to biopsy (your category) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. I had the sort of biopsy you will. It's weird. Laying on a table that's raised up above the medical professionals, with your breast hanging down through a hole in the table. But they give you painkiller (a numbing injection) before the biopsy. Then it's startling (and loud) when they use the biopsy \"gun\" to get the sample or samples. But it shouldn't hurt. If it does, tell them than you need more numbing medicine. Afterwards, they checked (with another mammogram) to see if they got what they wanted. For me, they repositioned and took another sample. (I could elect to have a warm blanket and volunteer who would pat my shoulder during the procedure. And I did--both! Afterwards, they gave me two cold gel paks that I could alternate putting in my bra. It was all I needed to help with pain afterwards.) In the meantime, call your doc's scheduler and tell them you're worried and would like someone to talk you through what you can expect. I know it's easy to worry, but really. Try not to borrow trouble that isn't yours yet. Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

I don't really have anything to add to the conversation, but thought I'd point out that any answer you get here at BCO is biased toward cancer, since the people who stay here and post are those who ended up with a cancer diagnosis. Those without cancer tend to go away and not post here any more. There may be many perfectly common explanations for your symptoms which are not cancer. But you're unlikely to hear about them here, since (for the most part), we aren't medical professionals, and can only speak to our own experience (which generally includes a cancer diagnosis). Take a look at this chart from the Imaginis site, which has additional info about the screening process:  On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. Your doctor has referred you for a diagnostic workup (mammogram & ultrasound). So you're one step up on the chart to begin with. Of all of those who are sent on to a diagnostic workup (your category!), only 25% are sent on to a biopsy--that is, 75% people \"fall out\" of the screen at that point. You may be told that you need to return to your routine screening schedule...or that they would like to see you again \"sooner\" so that can see if \"whatever-it-is\" is stable. Of the 25% who are sent on to biopsy (not your category yet!) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. You're early in the screening process. There are at least two distinct layers of screening you'd have to get through before you could even have the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. I know it's easy to worry (and reading about the experiences of those of us who managed to work our way to the cancer diagnosis portion of the chart doesn't help!), but really.

The combination with the anaesthetic used by the biopsy team. All things you don't/can't know. Does the biopsy team know about your pain meds? Have you specifically mentioned the meds to them? If not, you should. If they do biopsies regularly, they are likely to be accustomed to doing biopsies on patients on pain meds. You just need them to understand that you are in that population, even though you don't have a current cancer diagnosis. Do you have a pain doc? He/she may well have ideas (or even want to interface with whoever is doing the biopsy). What I would suggest is call the biopsy center and ask to speak to the pain management doc. Give them all the information you can about your pain meds,, tell them about your concerns and ask about anxiety pre-meds or if there are other things they'd suggest. Separately (and this may sound silly), but the breast center that did my core needle biopsy put a warm blanket over me and had a volunteer who (with my consent) rubbed my back/patted my shoulder and held my (other) hand during the procedure. Very comforting. And I had someone's hand that I could squeeze if I needed to. Best wishes with your biopsy (for best pain control & results!) LisaAlissa",

Eighty percent of all breast biopsy results (all ages, etc.) are benign.  So 20% of all breast biopsies have postive (bad) results.  Your risk would be even less than 20% because of your age.

Usually we don't focus on the \"other side\" of the family, since the family history that led to a concern that there could be a genetic mutation of the BRCA gene is usually on only one side of the family.  But if the children of a person who tested negative are \"lucky\" enough to have bad history (or no history) on the other side of the family, a genetic counselor may recommend testing for the children even though a parent has already tested negative.

Or whatever. If it's BC, then we'll help you sort out what next. Traditionally, the next step is surgery. But for certain kinds of BC, increasingly you may want to talk with a medical oncologist before any further surgery. But all of that is getting way ahead of yourself. Have your MRI, see the surgeon.

Depending on your specific diagnosis, medical oncologists are sometimes prescribing chemo before surgery to shrink the tumor to be excised. It's very hard to hear someone discussing your cancer and be able to take it all in and remember it. Consider taking a \"second set of ears\" with you--someone who can take notes and help you make sure you get all the questions on your list addressed. It can also be good to ask if you can record the consultation. Re-listening to it later can be very helpful. Please keep coming back--and hang in there! LisaAlissa",

If not, you'll want to get some referrals and do some interviewing. She needs to find someone she can have confidence in and a good relationship. There are potential treatments (if this is BC mets), and you (and she) will begin to feel better when you have a plan in place. Third, you may want to start a thread on the Stage IV board here, as there are lots of women here who are living with mets. HTH, LisaAlissa",

Earlier this month I discovered a very slight, shaped indentation on the bottom inside of my left breast. It can only be seen when I raise my arms. I found it while combing my hair after a shower and could not remember ever seeing it before. I wouldn't call a dimple per se, more of a very shallow divot. In addition to slight indent, I also have an ache-y type of pain in my breast, but I can't tell if that is because I have been touching it for the past month relentlessly or because something is not right. Of course, I look it up and Dr. Google sends me into an anxiety spiral! I went to my GP who could not feel any type of lump but referred me for an ultrasound and to see a breast surgeon. Nothing was found on the ultrasound and the breast surgeon did not seem to be worried about it. My question: should I have asked any follow up questions to the breast surgeon after the exam? In my relief, I totally forgot to ask any questions. She told me that it could just be the natural contour of my breast and that I had simply never noticed it before. The ultrasound did show that I had a \"normal fibroglandular pattern.\" A little bit about me: I am not 30 yet and I have had two paternal aunts who have been diagnosed with breast cancer (both before the age of 50, one in her mid 30s). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. She told me that it could just be the natural contour of my breast and that I had simply never noticed it before. \" Maybe. But maybe not. Take some pictures of what the \"slight shaped indentation\" looks like now and from time to time--and date the pictures. Take them at regular intervals. Maybe start with once a week if you're feeling nervous. If you're not feeling nervous or if you're not seeing changes at weekly intervals, you can stretch it out to monthly. Your pictures should also have something in them for scale. Like a small bandaid dot, or small sticker. Something you can apply before you take the picture, and that is easy to get more of so that you can continue to use the same thing to allow a comparison between pictures. If there are changes, they might well be so gradual that you don't realize that there are changes for quite some time. Dated pictures will let you identify any changes and share them with your medical practitioner. Since it can only be seen when you raise your arms, you might have trouble taking pictures--or maybe that will be perfect for you to take pictures? Or maybe you need a tripod and a timer? Or a helper to be the photographer. You'll have to experiment. For instance, I'd put a scarf or bandeu top over the nipples so that the pictures are \"family friendly\" unless nipples are relevant to the issue involved. But you should decide for yourself what is and isn't needed in photos to document the indentation. So to get to the question I would have asked the BS...can I call for an appointment if there are changes? HTH, LisaAlissa",

When you have concerns about your breasts, see your primary care provider, and tell them what you've told us, as well as anything else you've noticed or have concerns about. Write it all down (a list, questions or whatever) and take it with you. That way your medical practitioner can address all of your concerns. I can't say what this all might mean (I'm not a medical practitioner), but there are usually lots and lots of things that aren't cancer that can cause various symptoms. So try not to stress. As long as you are working with your medical practitioner to follow this up, you're doing what a well-woman should do when faced with breast-related symptoms. What you need to know is what caused/is causing the things that concern you. You might be referred to a breast center, or you might be referred for testing of some sort, you might be referred to a specialist of some sort, or you may be asked to follow some sort of treatment regime to see if it affects the symptoms you've seen. Any of them can be a suitable approach. The question you want to make sure you have the answer to when you leave the medical office is what should happen next? When should it happen? And when should you call back if whatever-it-is hasn't happened. And just keep pursuing answers until you (and your medical practitioners) are satisfied. HTH, LisaAlissa",

After that, they apparently will have healed with or without reconnecting. If it's without reconnecting, you've increased your chances for lymphedema.

The findings you have at this point make the need for an excisional biopsy clear to the medical professionals. (Without concluding that it is--or is not--cancer.) BTW, if you were having the same physical procedure, it would be called a \"lumpectomy,\" if you already had a cancer diagnosis. It's called an excisional biopsy because they still don't know. And this biopsy should give them the answer. I know you want the answer now. But sometimes it's just not available based on the tests so far. BC (or screening for BC) is a step-by-step process. And there's no use trying to rush ahead. If you think that another pathologist might have seen more clearly from the tissue that was removed, you can certainly ask for a second opinion on the slides/tissue... Note that you might discover that they agree with the findings you have so far. Not really adding anything to your information, just delaying the excisional biopsy that will give you an answer. But since you'd still be having a surgical procedure if they determine that it's cancer...why bother? You'll know more when you get pathology results back from your excisional biopsy. BTW, if you're not comfortable with the surgeon who will do the excisional biopsy--that is, you think you'd choose a different breast surgeon if it were cancer, then by all means choose another now.

First of all, 80% of biopsy results are not cancer (B9 or atypia). So there's no reason to think that it's cancer at all, until a pathology report comes back with that result. But any DCIS result leaves open the possibility (however remote) that there are mixed types of cells. I think he's just trying to tell you not to worry too much. Nice of him. But it sounds like he's set you to worrying. And while I'm not going to be able to persuade you not to worry, I'll say it anyway. Try not to borrow trouble that isn't yours yet. Nothing you can do (or not do), think (or not think) can have any effect on the biopsy result. (If you can't make yourself believe that, look up \"magical thinking\"...we all can let ourselves fall into that trap.) But the only thing worry can do is rob you of joy in the present moment. So try not to let yourself do that. Come up with your own way of redirecting your thoughts. One pattern would be: I have a good med team, I've turned this problem over to them. Nothing I can do (or not do) will affect the results. So right now I will __________________. Then fill in the blank with something you can distract yourself with.

Removing lymph nodes, expecially as many as all of the 1st & 2nd level nodes, is no picnic (not that any of this is).

(Both can raise the reading.)  If you're rushing, your heart-rate will be elevated, again, your reading will be higher than it should be.    2.  When you wait in the exam room, don't sit on the exam table.  Instead sit on a chair and lean back (and then ask them to take your blood pressure there) if possible.  You want to be relaxed and calm.  Breathe calmly. 3.  Don't cross your legs.  Don't hold your arm up.  Ask for a pillow (there's usually one in the room), then put it in your lap, and lay your arm on it--this will put your arm at (more or less) the level typically wanted without your needing to \"help.\"  If the person reading your blood pressure still wants to hold your arm up...let them!  Don't help.  Muscle tension (from holding your arm up, etc.) will increase your blood pressure.  4.  Close your eyes and think \"meditatively\" (tell your muscles to relax--like at the end of a yoga class, or while meditating).  Closing your eyes will tend to limit the conversation.  If they start to talk to you, just say that you'd prefer not to speak while they're taking your blood pressure, so that you won't interfere with their focus.   This is not the time to think about what you're want to discuss w/ your medical practitioner and his/her staff.  With any luck, you have all of those notes in writing.  For now, just breathe tension out of your body. 5.  If (after all of that) the pressure is higher than your \"usual readings,\"  say so, and ask them to check your BP reading again. The second reading is often lower! HTH, LisaAlissa",

Increasingly, medical oncologists (MOs) are suggesting pre-surgery chemo (neoadjuvent chemo) to (1) shrink the tumor before surgery, and (2) to see what chemos work on your particular tumor. If you have surgery before you even consult a MO, you'll never know whether they would have suggested that course of treatment for you. You may want to get a second opinion on something. For example, the pathology...or the treatments suggested by the docs you see first. Generally, with IDC, there's time. (There are types of BC, like inflamatory breast cancer (IBC) which are a genuine medical emergency...but IDC isn't one of them.) Hang in there and come back and talk with us if you'd like to discuss what you hear. You may want to record your consultation with the surgeon, as it's hard to hear and retain info when they're talking about your cancer! On the MO appointment in May, try calling the MO office and tell them you're wondering if they would suggest chemo before surgery, and ask if there is an earlier appointment you could get.

So sorry that you're having to deal with this, but there is still a chance that it will prove to be benign (hope, hope, hope...). The BiRADs 5 means that the person who assigned the score thinks that what they have seen and heard is \"highly suggestive of malignancy.\" Radiologists can use the BiRADs scores they assign to assess how well they are assessing the imaging studies they see. Approximately 95% of the BiRADs 5 category studies they've assessed should result in a positive biopsy if they're doing their job well. (They can use the statistical results of biopsies on their various BiRAD 4 and 5 categories to assess how their category assignments compare to those of other radiologists. However even for radiologists who are doing a good job, there should still be some biopsies of category 5 imaging studies that have a benign result upon biopsy (at least 5%). I understand \"preparing for the worst,\" but please don't feel you have to claim a cancer until you have a pathology report that says it is cancer. Here's hoping this is just a bump in the road.

Tamoxifen.  There are some people who have serious side effects from Tamoxifen, others who don't.  After you've gained an understanding of how your various risks can be addressed, if Tamoxifen if something that sounds appropriate to you and your medical team, then why not try it?  While some women have significant side effects, others don't.  You may be one of the women without significant side effects.    Prophylactic Bilateral Mastectomy (\"PBMX\").  Search for one of Beesie's posts (on the DCIS board) for factors to consider as you decide whether or not a PBMX is for you.  It's not an easy decision, and as you say, you'll want to gather as much information as possible before rushing into anything.  Then it will be a decision that only you can make.  Note that for insurance to cover it, they are likely to want to make sure that you've covered all of your bases (genetic testing/risk asseesments, etc.) This isn't the only surgery that is indicated for some women facing hereditary cancer risks.  As you gather information, you'll also hear suggestions that for some women, ovaries should also be removed.  You need to have your specific risks assessed.  Good luck!

(BTW, at that point, your surgeon would have known that you also had an invasive cancer, since DCIS (by definition) isn't invasive.)  You has a partial node disection of some sort (not sure what an \"axillary contenet excision\" is.). Generally speaking, the treatment required for the IDC will now govern your treatment going forward (other than making sure that the DCIS is gone--which the mastectomy should have done-- the treatment required for the IDC will be sufficient to handle the DCIS diagnosis).  Going forward, consider your diagnsis to be IDC.   You'll want copies of your pathology reports and your surgery report.  One of the things you'll want to know is \"do you have clean margins.\" Can he tell you what stage your cancer is...and can he walk through the factors that went into the staging.  And I'd ask what it means to you that your tumor is a mid-grade. We've been seing reports of research suggesting that radiation is helpful even with a mastectomy, so I'd ask whether or not you should consult with a radiation oncologist.  He should give you a referral to one. Given that you now have an IDC diagnosis, you will also need to consult with a medical oncologist.   HTH, LisaAlissa ",

It makes it harder when you're dealing with different personnel each time. The sonographer who said it was \"just from breastfeeding\" clearly didn't know your history (that the lump preceded breastfeeding by a couple of years) and (depending on where your US was done, shouldn't have commented at all! It's up to the radiologist to interpret the US...not the sonographer. However I'm encouraged that your new GP wants to do a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. While we can't know, she may have made that call before seeing the results of the US based on your several years' history with this lump. Sometimes a FNA is selected to identify a fluid-filled cyst that they don't expect will be cancer...but hard to know why they selected a FNA in your case. But there's no reason to assume that the bad attitudes of some of your prior medical personnel means they necessarily missed something. And worry won't change the results of the FNA biopsy you're scheduled to have. Try not to borrow trouble that isn't your yet. When you get the results of the FNA biopsy you'll know considerably more about your lump than you do now. When you're tempted to worry over this, just tell yourself that you have a good doc now, they've scheduled a biopsy which should give you information and there is nothing else you should do before you get those results! Then do something that requires your concentration. Hang in there! LisaAlissa",

You may want to ask their assistance in checking this out. Rash and swollen lymph nodes could present in many kinds of things. Talk with your PCP about what you've done so far, and whether they are the right person to help you get these symptoms sorted out from this point. Or get you referred to an internist who enjoys sorting out diagnostic puzzles. Specialists tend to focus on their specialty. Other possibilities may escape their notice (they often assume that your PCP will be coordinating among the specialists, reading and assessing their various reports and making sure that various specialists don't end up working at cross-purposes.

Good phlebotomists and oncology nurses have all kinds of \"tricks\" to place needles in veins that aren't cooperating. You don't have to be a pincushion while someone practices a skill at which they are not very skilled! You'll need to make your own decision, but here's what I'd do now: Call and speak with the office manager. Tell them about the tech's \"fail\" with the required IV placement, and that he asked you to come back in a week. Tell them that the appointment had been originally timed for the \"optimal\" time in your menstrual cycle to get the best possible imaging results (see djmammo's post above). You're concerned that the delay will result in sub-optimal results. Could they confirm with their radiologist that the results will be equally good a week farther into your cycle? (If not, perhaps they could get you in sooner since the problem was theirs, if the results would otherwise be impaired by the wait?) And if your veins are too bruised to use at an earlier time, can the IV be placed elsewhere? Then ask if an experienced person will be available to place the IV when you next come back, since the tech wasn't up to the task. My very best wishes to you for a much more successful imaging session next time, HTH, LisaAlissa",

Plan to take your smart phone with you to your appointment and ask to record the consultation. It's very, very hard to listen to discussions about your cancer. And a second set of ears (another person ;-) ) can be good to have along too. There will be lots of things to think about and decisions you need to make. But you don't have to make any of the decisions tomorrow. You have time. Most breast cancer has been developing 4-10 years before it is found on screening. Weeks--even a few months won't make a difference if you're actively seeking second opinions and/or exploring your options. For example, you'll want to read some of the posts from Beesie here, who has some of the most carefully researched and written posts about DCIS and treatment options: A Layperson's Guide to DCIS And you'll want to ask your surgeon what s/he would suggest you read. For instance, Dr. Susan Love's The Breast Book (new 6th ed. came out in Sept. 2015) will have info of all sorts on breasts and breast disease--most of which won't apply to you! HTH, LisaAlissa",

But don't let your mind \"go there.\" You're doing all of the things you should. Reporting symptoms and then letting your medical team direct your follow-up, while making sure that you don't get \"lost\" in the system. And there is a screening system that medical professionals use to follow up on breast symptoms and make sure that those that need to be get followed up do get followed. And it all seems routine and work-a-day to the medical professionals. And it is--to them. But to those of us who aren't familiar with the system, it's nothing short of excruciatingly frightening. At any rate, you've perhaps seen this chart around. It's from the Imaginis site, which has additional info about the screening process:  but I think it's helpful. On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. Your US was part of a diagnostic workup. Your docs decided that you needed a biopsy (the only way to determine if you have cancer!). And then changed their minds about what kind of biopsy. While your doc called it a \"lumpectomy,\" it will also probably be referred to as an \"excisional biopsy\" (since you haven't yet been diagnosed with BC),but the procedure is the same as a lumpectomy. My impression (based on what you said) is that your docs just decided that s/he was going to want \"it\" out whatever the results of the biopsy, so decided you didn't need the trauma of an \"extra\" biopsy procedure when the results wouldn't make any difference to your surgical treatment. I like to hear about docs who think about whether the test they're proposing will make any difference to your treatment...and then don't do \"unnecessary\" tests! But at any rate, you've now advanced to the \"biopsy\" stage of the screening process. Your newly reported symptom means that they need to \"back you up\" in the screening process to make sure that the new symptom is properly evaluated. I'm impressed that the girl asked you to call back if you don't hear from her. Sounds like she's had good training. And that means you can be more confident in your medical team. But it's still screening. What makes it interesting is that I think you're going to be at two separate stages of the screening process at the same time. First is the scheduled surgical biopsy (lumpectomy). Note that 80% of people who have biopsies do not have cancer. i suspect that when you talk with your team on Monday, you'll get told that you need to have a diagnostic workup related to your newly described symptom. Of those who are sent on to biopsy (your first category) 80% will be told their biopsy doesn't show cancer. All of the women who are sent on to biopsy have \"something\" that their docs can't be certain is \"ok.\" And there's no reason to think you will be in the 20% who are given a diagnosis of cancer. Your second screening may well delay the surgical biopsy. (Your surgeon may want to wait and see what the second diagnostic workup means for your surgical needs. Maybe nothing. Maybe something. But regarding the second screening, 75% of the people who have a diagnostic workup are told it's \"nothing.\" You \"beat the odds\"the first time around--and advanced to the biopsy stage in the screening process. But no reason to think you will this time. You're still going through well-woman screening at this point. As you work your way through the screening process, a very large majority are \"tossed out\" at every stage--including the stage you're at. This is part of why the medical people seem so casual about the whole thing. BTW, when reading on the BCO boards, it's easy to get a skewed version of your odds...the women who were \"dropped out\" of the screening process don't continue to post here. So you have the people who were unlucky enough to advance all the way through the screening process who continue to post. And there's no reason to think that you will be here for very long either.  Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process (twice!!) very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

For example it can cause the kind of scarring that Melissa mentions that could obscure a problem later in life.

With the holidays, I'm guessing that many of the pathology lab's schedules may be off..not that helps any. Mary, the part about the correlation is that the procedure report talks about how many samples they took (and maybe how large they are, etc.). The pathology report should say they got that same number of samples, then talk about them...probably individually. So they will correlate. For both of you, since you haven't heard yet, I'd call your doc's office back and ask when & how you can expect to hear the pathology report results. (This waiting from hour to hour is for the birds!--if you won't hear anything until the new year, then it would be nice to know that...). At any rate, you need to find out how their office handles this. Should you book an appointment with the doc to hear results? (when?) Will they call you? Will it be posted on the patient portal? If so, will they notify you that it's been posted? Or should you just keep checking? Tell them you want to know so that you will know when you should start calling around to find out what's happened. (BTW, this is always a good idea when you have a test or procedure. That is, to find out when the procedure reports/test results will be available and how.

I can't help with most of your questions, but on the why your \"breast would go up in density when its supposed to go down during perimenopause,\" question, it's quite possible that there has been no change in density. The description of density is based on the opinion of the radiologist reading the mammogram. If the first radiologist thought it was 50%, then you would get the description (26-50% dense) from your earlier mammogram. If the second radiologist thought it was 51% dense, then you would get the new description (51-75% dense). It's entirely possible that there has been no change in density...or even a decrease in actual density, just a variance in how different radiologists respond to the same density in an image. The BIRADS 0 simply indicates that the new radiologist isn't done with his review...and s/he won't be until they get the older mammogram images (not the reports, the actual images). Once they have that, they'll be able to assess changes and identify any areas of concern and (hopefully) relate all of that to your other symptoms. If I were you, I'd follow up on the arrival of the earlier images and make sure that your radiologist (the one waiting for the old images to arrive in the mail) knows that you're going to see a breast specialist on Thursday and would like older images, newer images and all interpretive reports to be sent for arrival at breast specialist's office before Thursday. You will also want to get copies of older images, newer images and all interpretive reports to have in your own hands (your radiologist should be able to give you a CD or DVD with all of those on it)--and then hand carry them with you to the breast specialist's office. It's amazing how often reports, tests & images don't get to a new doc's office when they should. Make sure you get them back and keep them in your own files.

US can see things that mammogram's can't (and vice-versa). While many women have dense breasts, that does make it harder to distinguish features on mammograms. So US is often added as a second way of viewing. My screening radiologist was involved in early research on adding US to mammograms...and I had both mammograms and US for more than 10 years before the year she identified very early BC (DCIS in my case). Interesting comment from the nurse (that you'll know \"something\" that day), but I'm not sure which day she was talking about. If it's the day you have US and a diagnostic mammogram, it could be that your imaging center will have the radiologist who reads the imaging speak to you immediately after the imaging session? Some imaging centers do that after diagnostic mammograms/US. If so, perhaps what you'll know is if they will (1) send you back to a normal screening schedule, (2) ask you to come back for follow-up screening in 3-6 months (to see if something they're wondering about has changed), (3) want yet-more imaging now, or (4) have identified an area they suggest be biopsied. I guess any of those would be something to know. If not (worst case, I suppose) is that they tell you when you will know something more. I know that you will worry, but do your best to distract yourself--no sense borrowing trouble that isn't yours yet. An \"architectural distortion\" is a description, not a diagnosis. The reason they need more imaging is that they don't know anything to tell you yet. For all you know, there was a fold in your tissue that caused a shadow they couldn't identify. They didn't have the right view (or perhaps the right imaging tech) to tell whether it was something that should be investigated with a biopsy or what. They're wondering, so are doing follow-up imaging (with more views) to try to discover what it was.

The skin/texture changes + size changes? These are potentially alarming and might call for asap evaluation, even if you weren't already in the midst of a diagnostic process. Note that I don't know enough to really be helpful on that. But you want to add that to your list of \"things\" to discuss. Given the renowned specialist who's been involved in reading your imaging and doing your biopsy, am I safe assuming that you're at a large university or hospital with a breast center? The reason I'm asking is that most institutions like that will have \"navigators\" to help patients navigate the process. Or ombudsmen to help with problems. There is clearly a paper discrepancy. But it is possible that there is no actual discrepancy. That's what you need to find out. For example, it could be that one of the samples managed to be separated into two so that what the pathology lab received as seven might have been \"taken\" from you as six. (I have no idea, but that's an idea of what might have happened.) So. To your questions. 1. Start with a \"navigator.\" Tell them you saw a discrepancy, and how can that have happened? That person will need to follow up with the various people who write reports/saw your samples. 2. Even if they use the same core needle, there are at least two things that could cause different sizes that come immediately to mind. How compressed were your breasts? Might they have taken samples in different areas where the compression was slightly different? Did the needle go to different depths in some of the core samples. Again, I don't know the answers--or even the possibilities. But it's certainly possible that there isn't anything wrong. Go in with a curious mind--you want to understand. No accusations...that just makes people defensive. And you want to enlist these people onto your \"team\" (if they aren't there already). 3. I haven't had those experiences. But given modern bar-coding/labeling procedures (where they slap a bar-coded label on the sample as it is packaged for the lab), it has become increasingly unlikely that there is a mislabeling error. That's something that the navigator may be able to help with. Where your biopsy was done, what is the procedure? Do they package/label specimens before they're taken away from the patient or the procedure room? Do they compare your bar-coded wrist band with the biopsy labels?All those things are intended to make mechanical errors less likely--although unfortunately, where humans are involved, nothing is impossible. 4. Do you still trust the \"expert\"? If so, ask him/her for suggestions on second opinion docs and on what portions of the process second opinions are required. (Given the bafflement among docs, the renowned expert might be as interested as you in having a second pathologist group take a look at your samples.) If you don't trust the \"expert\" is there another doc you do trust? Talk to that person about accessing another breast center group for second opinions. (BTW, consider checking in with your health insurer. They may well have some procedures you need to use to make sure second opinions are covered by your insurer.) 5. Finally, ask the navigator who you should ask to review the skin/texture changes. You are trying to avoid full-panic mode (they should appreciate that), but want to make sure that a new and potentially alarming symptom gets included in the diagnostic process.

Absolutely \"best\" for results/information is an excisional biopsy, where they take out the entire area that is of concern.

One of the least invasive biopsies is a fine needle aspiration (FNA). Less painkiller required, smaller scars, etc. If it can get you the results you need, it's the best. But it often doesn't produce enough information. Somewhere in between are various core needle procedures. Generally docs try to balance the various considerations.

I think some of the confusion is a matter of terminology. While a lumpectomy and an excisional biopsy are very similar (and sometimes, for that reason, they both get called a \"lumpectomy,\") their purposes are quite different. A lumpectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a known cancer (and hopefully get \"clean margins.\") An excisional biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove some \"suspicious\" tissue for analysis. Based on what you've said, what you're having is an excisional biopsy. Depending on what they find, they may or may not find cancer...and if they find cancer, they may or may not need to go back and clean up the margins. I can't offer an explanation about why your surgeon chose an excisional biopsy over a core needle biopsy. Generally, the least invasive biopsy (which will accomplish the surgeon's goal) is chosen. But factors involved in choosing one over the other may involve where the \"whatever-it-is\" is located and whether or not it is easily accessed with a core needle. Certainly ask your surgeon why he chose an excisional biopsy over a core needle biopsy. BTW, asking if treating a potential infection first would mean that a biopsy would no longer be required seems like a reasonable question. And asking how they will address a potential infection during the course of the excisional biopsy is also a reasonable question. My very best wishes for a B9 result! LisaAlissa",

I suspect it is simply the \"system\" sending out its \"standard\" email to you. HTH, LisaAlissa",

      "Content": "Jun 2, 2017 12:52AM LisaAlissa wrote: Hi Jessmh! Breast lumps are very common, and getting them checked out is exactly the thing to do (so lots of people have similar experiences!). It's one of the well-woman health care routines we all do. And as we get older we add more and more things to our routines. Just think of it as a routine part of your health care. Some things to think about: 1. You're about to begin a very standard screening process, to determine whether your lump is something to worry about or not. Most of them aren't. The standard screen looks something like this:  (The chart is from Imaginis site, which has additional info about the screening process.) On the above diagram, note that your goal is to fail to be advanced farther \"up\" the diagram. Each one is a narrower group of people. I'm not sure if the first test you'll be having fits into the \"screening mammogram\" (really the \"first screen\"--even though it's a sonogram) or the \"diagnostic workup\" category. You'll note that the vast majority of women at each level are not advanced to the next level of screening. 1. Genetic Testing. You didn't say how old your mother & grandmothers were when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. The reason I ask is that a \"young\" diagnosis (before 45 or 50) is more significant than an elderly diagnosis. If they were young diagnoses, you may want to look into genetic counselling to determine whether genetic testing would be helpful for you. That would be a good question to ask when you get the results of your imaging study. It may or may not be covered by your insurance, depending on your personal and family history. Note that you do want counselling, not just testing. There can be downsides to getting genetic testing, which the counselor will be able to help you think through. If you are determined to be \"high risk,\" you may want to begin \"standard\" screening earlier than usual--and perhaps with a breast specialist. 2. No prior images. At your age, I assume you don't have prior breast imaging (so nothing that they will be able to compare your new imaging to). So it's quite likely that they will ask you to come back for additional imaging (either immediately, or in 3-6 months) and/or have additional testing. Still nothing to panic about. 3. Research? You might want to read the first 50 pages or so in Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. Those pages discuss normal breast development and common (not BC) problems. 4. Specialists. Your OB/GYN was a good place to start in checking out your lump. A GP, internist or any other primary care provider would have been an equally good place to start. But none of them are an expert in breast issues, so getting referred for imaging is entirely normal. That your GYN wasn't particularly comforting shouldn't be taken as anything more than that s/he isn't the specialist in this area. Ideally, your referral is to someone who reads breast imaging studies all day every day. That is, a breast center. You may well get a referral to someone else as well, to discuss the imaging report. If so, that person may well be a breast surgeon. If that happens to you, it doesn't mean that it's bad news. Remember that there is a \"standard\" screening process that they run through when someone shows up with a lump. You're feeling panic...they view it as \"routine.\" 5. Get the actual report & a disk with the images. Whenever you have testing, be sure to ask how you will get the results, and when they should be available. You will get a so-called \"patient letter,\" but you also want the actual report which is sent to the doc who ordered the test. Keep track of where you've had imaging, so that you can tell docs in the future where to find copies of these images. And just in case the practice where you had imaging closes/moves/loses files, ask for a copy on disk. Then you'll be able to provide the prior images yourself if a doc needs them in the future. 5. Not likely to be BC. Finally, it is extraordinarily unlikely that a woman will develop BC at 24...not impossible, but very, very, very unlikely. But getting it checked out is the responsible thing to do! 6. Skewed impression. When reading on the BCO boards, it's easy to get a skewed version of your odds of a B9 result...the women who were \"dropped out\" of the screening process don't continue to post here. So you have the people who were unlucky enough to advance all the way through the screening process who continue to post. And there's no reason to think that you will be here for very long either.  Hope you fail to advance in the diagnostic process very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

Of course, that is a big procedure (surgery) and leaves big scars (which might be disfiguring and/or make later imaging harder to interpret). One of the least invasive biopsies is a FNA. Less painkiller required, smaller scars, etc. If it can get you the results you need, it's the best. But it often doesn't produce enough information. Somewhere in between are various core needle procedures. Generally docs try to balance the various considerations. If they can get good information from a less-invasive procedure, they'll generally try that. Sometimes they are wrong, and have to move to a more invasive biopsy. HTH, LisaAlissa",

I'm so sorry you've been having so much trouble with your breasts and have found such alarming information via Google. I would not ask the Derm for a punch biopsy tomorrow. As I read your post, you've been whirling around in circles from medical practitioner to medical practitioner, following no one's advice fully and starting over again with each new appointment. And scaring yourself to death with \"Dr. Google.\" I think you've worked your way into a tizzy and probably made the derm expect non-compliance from you, since that's what she's seen so far... So. I think you should start your appointment with the dermatologist with an apology and a request for help. Tell her that you heard a different thing every time you saw a medical practitioner for something else. And you realize that's not how to go on...and you want to follow her advice in order to get this skin condition sorted out. Write out a chronology of what you've done on whose advice and when. Bring along the three different creams you've used on your rash (hers, the anti-fungal cream & the \"expensive one). It's entirely possible that the combination of the three is what has made your rash \"burn\"--but the derm will need to advise you on what to do now, and if you need to \"live with\" the burn for a while, she may also be able to give you advice about how to soothe the burn until you get the effect she's trying for. Ask her what she'd like you to do now and tell her that you'll do what she says (and mean it!!!). Ask her when you should begin to see results. And when you should call her nurse for advice if you don't begin to see them. Promise her that you'll call her nurse if you have a new symptom or side-effect from the treatment, if some other medical practitioner suggests a different course of treatment--before you begin following that course--so that her office can coordinate with theirs. And that you'll wait to hear from her office before you make any changes or additions to her course of treatment for the rash on your breasts! Why should you apologize? Here's how what you told us looks to me (and think about it from the specialist's perspective!): Day 1: The Nurse practitioner sent you to the Derm, which makes perfect sense, as they are the specialist in the body's largest organ, the skin. Evening of Day 1: The Derm told you to: 1. Rewash all of your clothes in free & clear (did you do that?--you didn't say); 2. use hydrocortisone cream 1-2x per day. (not clear when you stopped using this...when you started the anti-fungal cream? when you started the expensive cream? sometime else?) and 3. Come back in 2 weeks (Implied that you'll follow the course of treatment prescribed by the derm until the follow-up appointment!). Day 4?: But instead of following the derm's advice, within a couple of days after your 1st derm appointment you asked another PCP (primary care provider) about your rash and let the PCP overrule the skin specialist (don't you and the PCP think a dermatologist would have recognized a fungus?--did you tell the PCP about the dermatologist & her plan for treatment and follow-up?) Your PCP has you start using an anti-fungal cream, which PCP says will clear rash in 1-2 days. (Is this when you stopped using the hydrocortizone prescribed by the derm?) It doesn't. Day 6?: So the PCP orders an expensive cream (what kind?) which you don't pick up until Day 12-ish (use for 5 days --note the timeline you describe doesn't seem to work out exactly....) Day 14 or 17? Follow-up appointment with derm. who is \"pissed [you] stopped the hydrocortisone cream\" (not clear when you stopped, BTW) and told you to \"go back on it and see her again in two to three weeks.\" (My impression is that you ignored her instructions completely, except for making a follow-up appointment. Is that true?) Note, you say the rash is \"not itchy so no need for hydrocortisone.\" So my impression is that you haven't yet followed the Derm's treatment plan--which she's told you to use twice, so far. You don't (necessarily) know all of the reasons that the Derm wanted you to use that hydrocortisone cream. Can you see why the Derm was angry at your follow-up appointment, and likely will be angry again? If you don't trust the Derm, talk with your PCP about a referral to a different derm, but in either case, you need to let a skin specialist direct the treatment for this rash. I know this is a hard pill to swallow, but you need to get a derm back on your side. She's doing what a derm (skin specialist) should do. Treating for the most likely, and then moving on to less likely causes. But you haven't let her get past the first step yet. So. Apologize, ask for her help and then promise to do as she asks. Hope your rash is cleared up very, very soon! LisaAlissa",

And nothing you do or don't do (or think or don't think) will affect any of the results at all. You've been a brave young woman in getting all of this checked out. But you don't have to be brave for any of this. You just have to show up. I'm not impressed with your nurse. If she think anything is funny (and I can't think why she should!) she should keep it to herself. Very unprofessional. Is she your primary care provider (\"PCP\")? If not, I'd talk w/ your PCP and get a referral to a social worker/therapist/nurse navigator. Most hospitals or breast cancer centers will have someone whose job is to help you through the process. For example, I was alone when I went through the biopsy process. The hospital where I was seen had volunteers available (if I wanted one--and I did) whose job was to pat my shoulder and rub my back during the biopsy process. And make sure that I had a warm blanket. They will give you numbing medication before the biopsy. And you should talk with someone about the procedure and ask if you can get EMLA cream to numb the area that will get that injection. Please come back and talk to us about your concerns. We are glad to talk w/ you! LisaAlissa",

If they didn't give you a couple when they did hte biopsy, you might call and ask if you can pick up a pair (that way you can have one in the freezer while you use the other one. ;-)) Separately, you should check in with your doc if that doesn't help, or if the healing doesn't seem normal. Separately, you don't seem to be able to stop thinking about \"horrible possibilities.\" I'd say it sounds like you might want to develop some \"coping mechanisms/strategies.\" Mindfulness--where you learn to notice that your mind had gone off to something other than what you want to be thinking of--and how to gently redirect your thoughts, might be helpful. Training involves things like focusing on your breath, then when your mind wanders (as it will) bringing it gently back to your breath. Lots of other similar exercises. But the idea is to give you tools that you can use to manage unruly thoughts and to be \"mindful\" of the things you want to be thinking of. Ask your doc if she can refer you to some mindfulness training--I think they have (or at least used to have) some classes at MDAnderson.

All that said, it is normal for a young woman to have dense breasts (breasts tend to become less dense with age), which the screeners find convenient, since as you no doubt have heard, mammography doesn't work well with dense breasts.  That your lump doesn't show on ultrasound doesn't mean it's not there.  Each lump is different, and different imaging techniques work better for different lumps.  You may need an MRI or some other imaging modality for your lump to be visible. It sounds as if you're being referred to a breast surgeon, and that is exactly the right next step.  The surgeon may suggest another imaging technique, or may suggest a biopsy.  Unfortunately, you'll have to wait to see. My only concern at this point is that if you have any of the symptoms of inflamamatory breast cancer you shouldn't be waiting.  That is the one type of cancer that moves very, very quickly.  I'd suggest you change the title of your thread or post another thread, including something about being worried about IBC (perhaps \"young military woman worried about possible IBC\" or something like that).  There are a number of women who can help you sort through what you need to do to get diagnosed (yes or no) on IBC asap from both the military and IBC perspective. Hang in there, and let us know how you're doing! LisaAlissa",

Generally, people come here during their diagnosis or treatment, then leave. If their biopsy is negative (80% are!) they leave and move on to the other challenges in their lives. ( Looking at the stories of the people who stay makes it look like nearly everyone who gets biopsies has cancer...and we know that's not true.) Similarly most people stay through their treatment, then leave. And while they're in treatment, they tend to post on threads related to what's going on in their treatment stage. The people who stay long term (and who are thus more likely to post in support of newcomers) tend to fall into a couple of categories. Those who stay in treatment, (or return and then stay in treatment) which would be the Stage IV people and the Lymphedema people. And those who just continue to post, like (for a very long time) Beesie. For example, I returned recently to help a friend, and saw a few threads where I thought I could be helpful, so I did), but I don't expect to stay.

Have you seen a genetic counselor?  They will be able (once you've filled out all of the relevant information forms) to assess your risks, given your situation and discuss them with you.  Depending on your circumstances, they may reccomend genetic testing (probably for the BRCA1 & 2 genes) then a further discussion.  I understand that research has shown that many women overestimate their risks related to breast cancer.  That may be what your psychologist was responding to...  But, if the risks (as the genetic counselor evaluates them) warrants it, they will help you explore risk-reducing options that are available (which may include a PBM).   See your primary care physician about a referral to a genetic counselor (ideally at a breast cancer center).  It's possible that the genetic counselling will even be covered by your health insurance, given your family history (but each insurer has their own standards, and the genetic counselor's office should be able to check that for you). Check out the web site for FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) which discusses risk assessment, hereditary cancer, finding a genetic counselor and how to manage risks.  You'll find lots of good information there about assessing and managing risks of hereditary cancer.  Once you've worked your way through the process, had all of the genetic work done, you may discover that you no longer want/need a PBM.  But if the risks warrant it, and you still want a PBM, you'll be in a better position to be perceived and treated as the calm, rational woman you will be (with all of the facts/evaluation at your command), and will (likely) have medical professionals who will support your decision. Best wishes! LisaAlissa",

Generally speaking, they will ask you to put together family information for them before your appointment, so they will have a chance to study your family. Since you have an appointment, if they haven't provided forms, etc. for you to use in providing that information to you, I'd call them and ask if you should have received it. When you're laying out your family tree, you may discover that there are close relatives whose history you don't know. I found it interesting to inquire of family members for details I didn't know. But it does take some time, so if they haven't told you what information they want you to provide, you need to check with them soon. Based on their analysis of your family and the history you can provide, they may (probably?) will suggest some genetic testing. But the history and types of cancer, causes of death and other illnesses are really, really important. HTH, LisaAlissa",

When I got my results back from Myriad, my genetic counselor indicated that as Myriad adds new tests, they re-review the samples previously received, and would advise the genetic counselor of any new \"positive\" results.  (I don't know if that would be the case if you were the \"add-on-test at a reduced price,\" or only if you paid the $3K for your testing.) So before you pay for additional testing, check w/ your genetic counselor and see if you'll be advised about the \"new gene discovered.\"  HTH, LisaAlissa",

It's definitely better than 80% of those called back for additional views/studies that are benign...  Remember that about 80% of biopsies show benign results.  And certainly being called back for additional views (and US) doesn't always result in a biopsy! (I don't know what the percentages are of those called back for additional views/studies that go on to biopsy.) Try to think of it as \"your Mom has a good medical team that is using current screening tech and standards to provide good preventative care.\" For years (at least 12) my mammograms involved additional views/ultrasounds on an almost routine basis, based on dense breasts.  For the last 4 or 5 years, they simply had me schedule both mammogram and ultrasound appointments at the same time...they simply knew they would need to be able to see more, given the denseness of my breast tissue.  None of those went on to biopsy.  (My DCIS was eventually found early by mammography...but additional views weren't even required to find it!) If your Mom's mamo was read by a new radiologist, if there was new equipment (so that the prior mamos weren't as helpful), if new studies/lit suggested follow-up for something not previously followed...all of those can lead to more follow-up studies.  My radiologist told me that over time the standard seems to be moving to more follow-up imaging, especially w/ ultrasound...and that she has been in the vanguard of that movement.  Perhaps your Mom's radiologist has \"stepped up\" their approach to this one?  I know it's hard, but after the first couple of years, I didn't worry about the results much more than I'd worry about the results of a pap smear (also a test for cancer, but one we dismiss as \"routine\"). If you can, take emtesla's advice and stay positive.

But there are lots of things to consider with a lumpectomy...when you say you \"don't do well with surgery\" are you talking about the anesthesia? There are options...but those are things you'll want to ask about and think about in your new thread. And there are various types of radiation, not all of which take 6-7 weeks. Similarly, there are treatment options that depend on whether your DCIS is ER+ or PR+ (hormone positive). You might want to consider adding details to your profile and making them \"public\" so that you'll get more helpful advice. Have you met with a doc yet? You're at the \"shock\" stage of this horrible process. I am so sorry that you'll be doing it all, but women here will be with you every stage of the way.

So here goes: A \"lumpectomy\" and an \"excisional biopsy\" both remove a lump of tissue. From the surgeon's perspective, it's the same procedure (and why he might call both of them a \"lumpectomy\" or a \"segmental mastectomy\" or whatever his favorite term is for the surgery he's performing. It's the purpose of the lump removal that differs, as well as your insurance company's view of the procedure and what are the appropriate add-ons/tests before the procedure. So. If you had had a cancer diagnosis, the lumptectomy would have been to remove the cancerous tissue. But you didn't have a diagnosis, so the purpose of your excisional biopsy is to get tissue for a pathologist to examine. And since a less invasive biopsy procedure was (apparently) not suitable for you, your surgeon will try to remove the entire lump while he's there. While you might have a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) during a lumpectomy (since you know you have cancer and they want to check the nodes), you wouldn't usually have a SNB during an excisional biopsy, since you don't know that you have cancer, and wouldn't want to run avoidable lymphedema risks. You can always come back for the SNB if you end up with a BC diagnosis. HTH, LisaAlissa ",

Take a look at this and scroll down to the descriptions of the various stages and the sizes then mention as associated with each.  You'll see what I mean: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/staging.jsp  Then take a large, slow breath and let it out very slowly, because until you see the post-surgical pathology report, anything you or we say will just be a guess. I gather you're having a wire localization before surgery, which while it isn't particularly pleasant, is at least quick.  The injections? does this mean a sentinal node biopsy?  If so, are you authorizing a axillary node disection if a sentinal node is positive?  There is new research on this, which you may want to explore: that a node disection beyond a SNB doesn't offer benefit but puts you more at risk for lymphedema. And keep talking to us about what's worrying you.  It does feel real in a way it hasn't before as you prepare for you surgery. Hang in there, LisaAlissa ",
