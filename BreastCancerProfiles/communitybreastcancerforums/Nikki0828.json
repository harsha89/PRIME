After I had my mammogram last week they found multiple new areas of segmented heterogeneous calcifications throughout my right breast. None of this was there two years ago. I have heterogeneous dense breasts which makes things hard to see. I had two stereotactic biopsies Wednesday to test the easiest to reach areas. I got the call yesterday that showed extensive DCIS and IDC. they also found a 2mm mass that they are doing additional testing on. Luckily I got a breast mri as well. Since my mom died from breast cancer at 36 I am high risk. Unsure of staging or hormone involvement until the final pathology report comes back from my two biopsies. My MRI showed my left breast is clear but my right breast shows in addition to the areas biopsied there is a large area which the radiologist is sure is also cancer. It doesn\u2019t look like there is muscle invasion or lymph node involvement. This whole process has been a nightmare including the way I\u2019ve been treated by healthcare professionals. Little to no compassion from the radiologist when she told me I had cancer. As a nurse myself I would never talk to my patients that way. I have to meet with my surgeon on Thursday. I feel lost and that the world is falling apart. I have two small children. Just recently went back to school to pursue my masters in nursing for family nurse practitioner. That will obviously be put on the back burner. I watched my mom die from this. I don\u2019t want to die too and leave my babies alone. I keep trying to rationalize with myself. Maybe they made a mistake. Maybe the pathology was accidentally switched with someone else\u2019s. I was naive to think after my BRCA1&2 came back negative a few years ago I wouldn\u2019t get breast cancer. Now here\u2019s i am. I don\u2019t know if anyone is reading this. I guess it\u2019s like therapy for me Log in to post a reply",

I tried explaining to my daughter that there is a monster inside of me that I need to have surgery on to try and kill. I don\u2019t know if that was the best way to explain the situation but was the best I could come up with. I know she doesn\u2019t understand and I don\u2019t expect her to. Your not alone. (Hugs",
