Then was called back in Dec 2011 for magnified mamo of right breast. Then referred to a Breast Specialist in Jan 2012, then stereotactic biopsy in Feb, surgical oncologist in March, and finally a wire localized excisional biopsy last week.  The waiting has been excruciating... and the anxiety overwhelming as im sitting here waiting for the final pathology report. Could you send me that you Tube link on meditation and hypnotherapy?  I would surely appreciate it. Thanks!",

On Monday, i will see the surgeon for the final path report and get the plan for future screenings.  I feel so blessed that my results are not cancer.  My favorite aunt had her lumpectomy 2 weeks ago and she has IDC. She will need chemo and radiation. The OSU actually stands for Ohio State University. Thats my alumnus. Graduated in 1991 with a BS in nursing. Im a Big Ten girl who lives in Northern California...",
