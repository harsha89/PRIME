    "Content": "littleemmi wrote: Hi everyone, I had a bilateral mx with nipple sparing DIEP reconstruction 2.5 years ago. In the last few months I have noticed a red line on the side of one breast. 2 weeks ago I had dental work (crown and 2 fillings) in the span of 2 days. 2 days later I ran a high fever 103.2 with breast swelling/red streaks. 2 days later a inch long wound appeared around my nipple. I was treated for a breast infection which improved with antibiotics although not completely gone. I had an MRI which showed thickening in the skin of my effected breast with a \"metal artifact\". So, I am questioning what is the metal in my breast. Also, is it something that should be there since it is only on one breast and if I should take antibiotics prior to dental work in the future. Has anyone else had to deal with a breast infection long after surgery. Obviously, I am not breast feeding so it seems pretty bizarre to me. :) Log in to post a reply",
