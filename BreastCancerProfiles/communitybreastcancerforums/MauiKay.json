      "Content": "MauiKay wrote: I read an article on the M.D.Anderson site about using an anesthesia during surgey that prevents a lot of the pain signals triggered during surgery.  It is alled \"Paravertebral block\" supported by Dr. Farzin Goravanchi, D.O.  It is supposed to have no side effects and people feel able to leave the hospital 1 1/2hrs. after surgery. Has anyone experienced this anesthesia or have recommendations to avoid the post surgery anesthesia problems? Log in to post a reply",
