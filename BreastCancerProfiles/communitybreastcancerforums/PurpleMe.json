Anyway, the sleeve felt slightly loose around the wrist and when I did my workouts I seemed to be constantly tugging it at the top.  My upper arm also appeared to slightly poof out (does that make sense) from the top of the sleeve.  I am trying to get a sleeve for when I workout and when I fly. Did some more research and also spoke to my LE therapist (she is not the fitter) and from what I understand the sleeve should be snug around the wrist and not so snug up by the axilla.  And the other thing I read is that a poor fitting sleeve can do more harm than good. I am going to give this fitter another shot but I want to be as knowledgeable as possible.  How do I tell if the sleeve fits properly?  How should it feel?  I know it needs to be snug at the wrist and that my upper arm shouldn't \"poof\" out above the sleeve - right?  But can anyone explain how the sleeve should feel on my arm? Should it feel tight around the wrist and gradually feel looser as it goes up the arm? Just slightly snug around the wrist and snug all the way up the arm without any \"poofing\" at the top? Any help will be greatly appreciated. thanks  My life is an unfinished canvas waiting for the next brush stroke.

Check out the website www.stepup-speakout.org  There is lots of good information on that site.   I had 10 nodes removed & had chemo and rads.  After I finished treatment hubby and I went to Vegas for a celebration and then 6 months later we went to Aruba for vacation.  In January of 2010 my arm was swollen. I did not have a sleeve or glove/guantlet for either flight.  Would having a sleeve & glove made a difference, I'll never know.  In hindsight I wish I had known to go to a therapist before I went on either trip & had been fitted for a sleeve. I would definitely recommend a sleeve and glove or gauntlet for flying and please go to an LE therapist first. Best wishes ",

Anyway, after about 4 hours I was used to the colour.  So ladies hang in there and if you are looking for a more natural hair colour product - check out the Tints of Nature (no I don't work for the company).  It is not cheap but I figured it was worth it because it is a more \"natural\" product.  Not as harsh as other products out there. Now if I could just get the darn eyebrows to grow!!!! ",

I am 17 months post TC chemo and while my hair has come back, my eyebrows are practically non-existent.  Is anyone else in the same boat?  I have been powdering in my eyebrows and to be honest I am considering the eyebrow feather tattoo technique because I am getting tired of the powder thing.  I will be perfectly honest, the no eyebrow thing bothers me more than the no hair on the head thing.  Of course, maybe if the eyebrows came back and the hair on the head didn't I'd be singing a different tune. My questions...first - has anyone done the eyebrow tattoo thing and if you have does it look as good as the powdering?  would you do it again?   My other question is - has anyone tried anything (supplements for example) that has helped with the eyebrows? Any help will be most gratefully appreciated. Thanks",

      "Content": "Jul 27, 2010 07:46AM PurpleMe wrote: My understanding about hair regrowth after chemo is that for the majority of people the hair does come back curly - I always had curly hair so this was no big deal to me - however, that after about a couple of years the hair starts to regrow as it did before chemo. I know that when mine first grew back in it was way curlier than my hair had been prior to chemo.  I am now 17 months post TC and my hair is pretty much back to what it was pre chemo.  So for those of you who are disliking the curls hang in there.  I didn't colour my hair until about 7 months post chemo mainly because I had read that post chemo hair is very fragile so I hung in with the grey longer than I normally would. For those struggling with your curls my suggestion is to find yourself a hairdresser who is a curl expert.  Do not be fooled by hairdressers who claim they know how to cut curly hair...trust me...most don't!  There is a website called www,naturallycurly.com and on this site is a section called Salon Reviews that I would recommend checking out.  From experience, learned the hard way, I believe the best way to cut curly hair is cut it when it is dry not wet. Also a hair stylist who knows curly hair will also be able to suggest the best products to use for your type of hair and curl.  My 2 cents...  ",

Walking, yoga, dancing, running - doing something you enjoy that gets your body moving I think is very important. Are you getting enough rest as well?  It is such a fine balancing act - eating right, exercising, getting enough rest...and yet I believe some years - no matter what we do are just bad years for cold and flu bugs. ",

Of course it wasn't until round three of my T/C that I found out if I had asked for cooling mitts/booties it may have helped prevent this whole business with the nails.
