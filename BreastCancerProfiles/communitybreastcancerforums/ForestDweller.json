This evening the LPN from my oncologist's finally calls and tells me it's on Wednesday. Well I will have my first ever Abraxane treatment the Monday before. I ask her if this is OK. She says that this is the appointment they gave her. lol Not exactly what I was worried about. I asked if this is done under any type of anesthesia .....she didn't known. Again I voiced my concern about it being two days after a chemo that I've never had and won't know how i will feel. She told me I'm overly concerned with convenience issues. Will I be vomiting and having diarrhea running down my legs in the ct scanner? I hate nurses. Log in to post a reply",
