My 3rd AC was the worst (that was mine last week).  I am scared about the 4th on Wednesday but as it looks here, #4 is not as bad a #3 which I'm grateful for.  I too will then begin Taxol (4 sessions).  I also heard that Taxol it is much easier than AC.  I can't imagine working after chemo treatments or for days to a week after however, I'm going a little stir crazy at home.  For a week after my AC it's hard to focus, sit still (except sleep sometimes), read, watch tv etc.  I hope all that goes away with the Taxol.  Happy day after Mother's day.",

Hope everyone writes about their experiences.  I know I will. MaggieO",

Received 2nd treatment yesterday.  Started to really feel the effects late evening and now.  Lovely numbness on wrists, ankles, nausea, all around bleghy feeling.  I hope the side effects don't last a week like last time.  Feels pretty yucky.  Hair is still here but I am ready for it to begin to go any day now.  Thank goodness for family and online support.  That''s all for now.  Maggie O",
