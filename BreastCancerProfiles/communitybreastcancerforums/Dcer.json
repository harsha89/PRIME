    "Content": "Dcer wrote: I'm writing for my wife and well maybe my nervousness. Her doc found a lump in her breast last week and thus ordered an ultrasound and mammogram today. The radiologist said that the lump was not concerning however there were 3 lymph nodes that she wanted biopsied. My wife can't remember if the radiologist referred to the nodes as \"replaced\" or maybe \"reactive\". Regardless, We're unsmderstanbly scared. Does anyone have insight into if swollen lymphs that need to be biopsied are generally cancerous? What else could it be? She is 37, healthy/active, and feels absolutely fine...
