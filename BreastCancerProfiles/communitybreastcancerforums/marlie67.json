Instead my surgeon told me that I had to make the big decision of lumpectomy or bilat mx. I thought that was a decision I would make later, after the staging, but he said why have two surgeries, if I was choosing the latter anyway. I am choosing the bilteral mx. I am not sure about the recon right away though. I am afraid of waking up without breasts. I am a DD to an E right now, I think I will be in shock without any. The talk of TEs make me nervous. I guess I always thought breast implants were under the skin, not the muscle. I am confused and scared. I hate bc so much! I cried for an hour and can't sleep. Sorry I am rambling, but I feel like a scared child right now.",

My PCP read me the core biopsy results and said that the one lesion reported \"malignant invasive moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma in situ.\" My question is: doesn't in situ mean non invasive? So why is it invasive? This has been bothering me. The other lesion she said reported \"high grade (scribbled something cant read) fibrodic.\" That one is not cancerous?? What does the high grade mean. This all seems to be hitting me tonight and I am having a melt down. thanks for any answers. Log in to post a reply",

The first one lookd like IDC. I am going to not work myself up and instead let the surgeon explain it to me on Friday. I have been handling the news better than I would have expected, but yesterday was hard for me. I think PMS played a part in it too. It's alot to wrap your head around. I know I have to take it one step at a time and try not to get too ahead of myself. I am happy to have this forun to read all the info and how so many strong women are going through this too. I am sorry you are going through this scary journey too. Big hugs back to you!",

I totally relate to you about being afraid of treatment. I have never had any surgeries or broken bones, and have rarely been sick. But, here I am with bc and getting ready to go through treatment. I am going to do whatever I need to do to make sure this thing is gone. If it comes to it, you will find your inner strength. We all have it; and it will get you through. Keep us posted. Hugs and prayers to you!",
