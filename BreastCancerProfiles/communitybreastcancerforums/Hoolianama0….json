I have been thinking about butterflies, fairies and shooting stars.  I haven't made any decisions since I am getting chemotherapy first. I will know for sure by this July.",

And by posting here you are doing exactly that. I was just diagnosed last week this time and like you, due to my medical history, I will have a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. Right away I plunged into despair and feared the worst. One day I heard my children laughing in their room and I broke down crying. I want to be here for my children and see them grow up. Suddenly, I felt that was being threatened. My daughter heard me and asked me why I was crying. I told her that I was frustrated about my boob. She looked at me and said, \"don't be frustrated, don't worry, we're here.\"  This is when I realized that as scared as I am about the near future, my two kids are worth a million boobies. I am still afraid however I can face this by setting goals for myself.  My first goal is to connect with wonderful and strong women who have walked in my shoes and to support anyone that has just been diagnosed. My medical goal is to get a second opinion, which is scheduled for 4/8/09. Once I have that, I can proceed with faith in my doctors and their suggested treatment. My goal for the house is, \"if it ain't dangerous, it can wait.' My goal for my children, to have more patience. The rest is still a work in progress.  I pray you find your answers and wish you the very best.",

The best approach to offer of help that springs to my mind was when a friend said, \"What can I do to help?\" It was a relief to hear that instead of \"I'm so sorry.\" My mum and I are close and I know she is upset and worried. She is helping me by watching my children while my husband and I go to doctor's appointments. If you live close by her, offer to go with her to appointments. It is actually better to have another person with you since a person can feel overwhelmed with all the medical terms. My cousin did that for me at my second opinion visit. I asked to to take notes and ask questions if she saw I was not responding or falling into silence. She was great. This place is a wealth of information, comfort and support. We will do all we can to help you both through this. Hugs to you and your mum.",

When I was diagnosed in Orlando, Florida in 2009 with stage 3 bc, I immediately got a 2nd opinion in North Carolina. Although the suggested treatment was the same, I at least felt a sense of relief that I would be getting the correct treatment at my local cancer hospital.

I want to encourage you to continue to ask questions of your doctor, this message board and even think of getting a second opinion. It is hard to absorb, let alone accept, the diagnosis within a few days or weeks. This is my 4th week after being diagnosed and I still have questions that I will find answers to. I too am concerned that they want to do aggressive treatments on a grade 1 tumor, however, I am not a physician. Utilize as many resources as you can to help keep yourself informed of treatments and options. I have 3 tumors in my left breast, 1 of them is at least 5cm. My oncologist and surgeon both suggest chemo first to shrink the largest tumor down and then surgery to remove the breast. There tumors are too far apart to save the breast in my case. I pray you will find the best treatment plan for you.",

My first reaction is that you need to get as far away from this man because he is toxic and this impedes your healing. You need to be surrounded by positive people and not negative ones. Now let me step back from that statement. I understand that financially, you need him around to share the burden. Besides the finances, what is the other reason you need him in your life? If it is love, then I say that his love is also toxic. I don't know how it got to this point, however, I can only say that you DO NOT deserve this treatment. You are facing this challenge and living as strong as you can. You are working AND doing treatments?!  That is major. Now speaking of the \"friend\". Basically the issue is not her, it is really his disdain for you. The other woman is an excuse. Even if she disappeared tomorrow, it is his treatment of you that needs to be changed. Saying that God is punishing you for being bad is absolutely ludacris. Our God is a loving God and do not let him use that to keep you down. There are so many resources out there for women facing breast cancer. You stated that you are stage 4 and you have had other medical conditions that you faced recently.  I am sure there is a mountain of assistance for you just because of your stage. I want you to know that you are valuable, you are worthy. You matter. You count. You are important. Never mind this illness/dis-ease; you are still worthy of respect. Let your doctor know what you are facing. Most hospitals have social workers that can put you in touch with resources. Believe it or not, verbal abuse is taken very seriously as domestic violence. At the end of the day, the choice is yours. You decide how happy or sad your life will be. Your life is not over. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.",

The doctors should be able to tell you the following before any treatment begins: 1) what type of cancer is this 2) how big is the tumor(s) 3) are any lymph nodes involved 4) has it travelled to the bones or other organs These are standard questions the doctors should answer once they have all the info back from the biopsy. Question 4 should be answered once they do a bone scan. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment first because they need to see if the tumor is reponding to it. If it is at all possible, get a second opinion from another facility that has a breast cancer program, just to make sure the standard of care is correct. I am praying everything goes well for you.
