I think there probably are folks who don't understand, or who just don't care.  However, those folks shouldn't be used to paint the whole \"healthy\" community as insensitive or uncaring.  When we don't understand, as some have stated above, what exactly our loved one needs at a particular moment, that doesn't mean we don't understand the roller-coaster ride of alternating terror, hope, pain, and uncertainty that this horrible disease brings, or that we can't learn to understand as time goes on and communication lines are open. LJ's Mom, I would bet you that your teenage boys probably do have some sense that you don't want to be treated as if you are dying, and yet also need more help sometimes because of your disease, and are probably too young, immature, and inexperienced to know just where to draw that line.  I know that I consciously stop doing things that need to be done sometimes when I see my wife has a burst of energy, so she doesn't feel like she's on a \"deathwatch\".   I guess the upshot of it is, communication is key, especially with us idiot men, as we don't pick up on the nonverbal clues as well as you more empathic womenfolk do.  I LOVE it when my wife is specific about what she wants, do the best I can to pick up on what she hasn't told me, and hop for the best.  I hope for the best in your family situation as well. Sincerely, Sean E. ",

On the other hand, if the marker level goes up, then the cancer is not responding and the treatment may need to be changed. (One exception is if the cancer is very sensitive to a certain chemotherapy treatment. In this case, the chemo can cause many cancer cells to die and release large amounts of the marker into the blood, which will cause the level of the tumor marker to rise for a short time.) Hope this helps. Sincerely, Sean E.",
