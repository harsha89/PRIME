MAI 40 triple negative, partial response chemotherapy. ypT4N3.   Now I receive radiotherapy 60 Gy in 30 treatment days, no additional therapy, because I'm triple negative. I'm concerned and do see the need for additional treatment, given the amount of disease found after mastectomy and the disease still remains (in the skin around the scar). According to the doctor, there is no scientific basis for complementary treatment. What is your opinion? We go now to another hospital for their advice.

February last year, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, exactly within the year she got plearal metastases and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (lymph nodes in the lungs, which blocked with cancer cells. Tumor embolism in march (tumor cells that blog the aorta). In may metastases in the central nervous system and on May 28. she's dead. Her suffering I can not explain, it was huge and my loss is big. She was my first love since I was fourteen and she always will be. Together we have tree children (11, 7 and three) I'm from the Netherlands (so my bad english is therefore).  By day I am busy with the children and the household, in the evening and night are the ghost. All those memories and images that occur in my head. I am als very lonely and I'll do this kind of crazy things than (this piece of writing).  Recognize the stages that you go through, give you all the best hope I have.  Live now without fear, because fear does not change fate, but it changed youw way of live. Not everyone goes, my wife was unique in everything. No one as strong as she, no one so special for me.   Can somebody help me to unsubscribe this account?  ",
