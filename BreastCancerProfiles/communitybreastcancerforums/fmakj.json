Sue- I think it is a wonderful idea to visit your parents if you feel the need to.  You may need to wear a compression sleeve (if this it what it is called?) when you are flying though.  If you do not have an appointment with your onc to ask, you can always ask your rad techs to email him/her and ask the question that way.  It would put your mind at ease. Yesterday was the first day that I felt tenderness (irritation) at the axilla scar - was told today that this is \"normal\".  I had already developed red dots (like pimples) in and outside the tx area and was told that that was probably a reaction to something but not the tx.  I was told yesterday to wear the sports bra and get into it by stepping into it instead of pulling over my head (never thought of it!).  What a difference and the softness feels much better on the irritated skin under my arm!  But no visible irritation yet!  I have also been experience small stabbing sensations in my radiated breast which again I was told is \"normal\".  Oh well, so far so good! Has anyone noticed a different texture to your hair (sorry to those that do not have any).  My hair seems to be getting very straw-like in texture and do not know if it is from the txs or from washing it sometimes 2 times a day (if I get in my pool I immediately take a shower to remove chlorine.)?
