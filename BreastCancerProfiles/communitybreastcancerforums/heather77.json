    "Content": "heather77 wrote: I have dimpling in my right breast. about an inch above that I have a scar from previous biopsy about a year ago. wouldn't think it'd be scar. both ultrasound and mammo negative. they said could be resolving fat necrosis. I'm scheduled for mri in June. my concern is it is getting bigger. my sister passed away 6 months ago from breast cancer. we are both genetic negative for the genes they know of now. I'm just wondering if I should push for mri sooner. I do get ultrasound every 6 months then mammo the opposite 6 months. I do have hyperplasia but not atypical and pash (whatever that is) in the same breast . I do have pictures but can't put them on this site. thank you all for your help Log in to post a reply",
