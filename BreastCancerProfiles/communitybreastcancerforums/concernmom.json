She told me I will not find a doctor that will put me under anesthisia for the removal of tissue. I dont have any family history of cancer, ie...sister mother aunts and lots of cousins.  My first reaction was to do a complete masectomy with reconstruction implants.  I am still considering it, I know its drastic but I dont want to keep getting cut up.  Like you said Leif, they would have to check all over my breasts continuosly. So thankful for you strong ladies and for caring enough to respond to use newbies, you will always have an Angel behind you. :)",

I will check out the website you listed.  This may be a hard question to answer but do you know off hand how many women started out with ALH and got cancer within 10 years or less.  I am going to see another BS for second advice, I probably will have the tissues removed, just wish doctor would put me under anesthisia.
