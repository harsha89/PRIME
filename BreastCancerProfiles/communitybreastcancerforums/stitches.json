Idaho the camisole was provided post-surgery at the hospital and I wear it everyday.  At night I use one of my older ones, step into it, and it protects the wounds while healing from zipper/buttons when sleeping.  It helped to put clothing that I can wear now in an easily accessible drawer, as well as cups/glasses in a low kitchen cupboard.  Beats standing on a chair to reach things!  I hope you will have good support at home - my DH helped me do all kinds of disgusting things, and willingly :o)  Let anyone who offers bring you meals - that is wonderful.  I'm sending prayers for you and all who contribute to this board.  Love, Stitches",
