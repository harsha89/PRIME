Told I could shower 48 hours after surgery, remove the gauze around the drain tubes but leave everything else intact, then thoroughly dry the area and replace the gauze.  It sounded like such a job I put it off until today after reading these posts.  Pinning drains to a bathrobe belt is a great idea. My DH (that means Darling Husband, right?) helped me replace the gauze.  I feel 100% better.",
