Besides having boughts of reoccurring mastitis while breastfeeding in the first few weeks of each birth, I haven't had issues with my breasts. The mastitis always cleared up. I haven't lost all my baby weight from my last pregnancy so my breasts are quite large 38DD (normally I'm a 36C) I have large pores on my breasts (both sides all over) so I'm not sure that would be considered orange peel skin? It's not rough skin, it's smooth but the pores are large. I just noticed this week that when I lay flat on my back there's a very small dip in the Areola on my right breast and left side as well(just slightly) I don't have it while standing up. I don't have any itching, redness, pain or swelling. I showed my husband but he thinks I'm being paranoid. I have called to make an appointment with my doctor just waiting to hear back from him. Should I be concerned? In all honesty I have myself worried sick right now...losing sleep over it. Does anyone have larger pores? All over (not just one spot) but on BOTH breasts and slight dip in the Areola? I'm thinking maybe this is from being overweight right now .... Help Log in to post a reply",
