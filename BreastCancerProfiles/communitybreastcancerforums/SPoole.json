In one week I meet with the oncologist, in a week and 1/2 I'm having a port/central line installed and will start neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( x 3 mo.) to shrink the cancer before it is surgically removed. Will also start Herceptin. I'm petrified that it has spread because my legs/knees have been sore and achey for a year. I assumed it was weight gain or arthritis. Anyone out there have the same diagnosis as me? Just told my daughters today (11 & 13)....I had to wait until after Christmas. I'm 41....How did I get here?

I feel as if I can handle all the side effects and the entire change of life as I (we) know it. I just wish I could forsee the outcome, look through a crystal ball and know it will all be worth it. I fear the possibility of met's (obviously) and the waiting is almost barberic! I keep thinking I'm doomed because of the size of the tumor, because my knees kill, because I'm ER & PR- and because I have both IDC and ILC....this all adds up to doom. Why all these negatives, not even 1 break? Am I doomed? My scan's are all this week....please pray for me and my family.",
