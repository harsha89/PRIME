The only radiologist said was it\u2019s type one and small. I have to go for an MRI and find a breast surgeon. Since my first biopsy came back benign I wasn\u2019t expecting this. Should I have got more information. If I call him back what questions should I ask or do I just have to wait until the MRI to find out more? Also my husband was out of town when I got the news. I am so scared and devastated. I know stage one is \u201cgood\u201d but I don\u2019t want any cancer. I don\u2019t even know how to go about telling people. I don\u2019t want to be the sick mom or the cancer mom. Just so many emotions right now Log in to post a reply",
