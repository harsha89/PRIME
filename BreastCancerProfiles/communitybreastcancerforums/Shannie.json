It's been a few months since I've posted.  I've been reading a lot of posts about everyone's hair growing back after chemo.  It's been 10 weeks since I finished.  I start Tamoxifen next month after radiation. My hair is slowly growing back...or should I say my peach fuzz.  One side has more hair then the other, the top isn't growing as quickly as the rest of my head at all.  I'm starting to get concerned.  I started taking 2500 mcg of Biotin a few weeks ago but read some of the other postings that the ladies are taking 5000 mcg so I think I will start taking 2 of them to reach the 5000 mcg.  I also take a multivitamin, fish oil and calcium that have I been taking for a few years.  Any suggestions would be helpful. Shore-One of your post said you were using extra virgin oil.  What does that do to help with hair growth?  My scalp has been very itchy and dry too.  Did anyone have that and what did they do to help it?",
