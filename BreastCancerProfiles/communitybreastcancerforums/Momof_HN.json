I'm no stranger to finding lumps because I have fibrocystic Breast and have had 2 removed (both benign) Those lumps moved and were painful, but this most recent one doesn't move and doesn't hurt. It's not directly on my Breast so at first I didn't think it was a big deal. After talking with my sister she talked me into calling. I'm not worried all that much but it's the all that much that's pretty scary! Log in to post a reply",
