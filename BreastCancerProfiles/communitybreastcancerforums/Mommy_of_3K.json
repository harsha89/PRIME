I felt an ache or burn, sort of like a bee sting, in my right breast, which prompted a self exam. When I found a lump, I went to my GYN who ordered a 3d mammogram and ultrasound with biopsy as clinically necessary. My appointment for this is 945 EST tomorrow. What should I expect?

This newly found mass seems to have taken precedent over the palpable lump in the other breast. Should I ask for an excisional biopsy to be done when they biopsy the mass on the other breast or should I wait to see what pathology shows?
