ER-positive disease does not generally respond well to single agent immuno, whereas triple-negative does better, however in the science literature the luminal B subtype of ER-positive (PR-negative, hiKi67) responds about as well as the triple-negative cancers. As Z points out, there are many trials underway or in preparation stages to try different ways to get immuno to work on many more patients and more types of cancer, so the thinking on how and when to jump in will change in coming years. A study was done where they tested 97 FDA-approved drugs to see which ones would help responses to immuno, and the top hit was HDAC inhibitors, and so trials are underway combining immuno with HDAC inhibitors, however for those trials you have to be off of Letrozole/Ibrance. A paper was just published in Science which shows that immunotherapy-boosted T cells eventually become 'exhausted' and so although the effects are very durable they may not be perpetual, and so again the hunt is underway for agents that improve that, again the suggestion being to try the HDAC inhibitors so the cells can reprogram. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/1...",

To the point that you may only have one shot at immuno, surely that is not the case?, I've read of people who failed to respond to Keytruda but then in a later trial responded to combined immunotherapies, such as checkpoint and CTLA-4. Immuno is qualitatively different from trials that test drugs, in that sense, and there isn't really a reason I can think of that should exclude you based on prior exposure, its not like your cancer has developed an immunotherapy resistance, is it?- I haven't read the exclusions for these trials regarding this point, and it could be that researchers want to exclude people who may not be responders, but its worth checking if this is true. A bigger concern may that that there will be more trials of promising therapies that might be perfect for us than we could hope to have the time to participate in..",

To pay you back, here is a promising research story that came out yesterday. It is an amazing story from a major cancer immunotherapy researcher at Stanford. However, I have not had time to look up the original article, and from what they write, I just can't tell if it is something that could work on patients who are already metastatic. But Z and others can maybe figure that out quicker than I. What they are reporting, in a nutshell, is that you don't have to give patients whole-body immunotherapy, massively stimulate the entire body immune system, the way CAR-T and checkpoint inhibitors do. Instead, working only in mice thus far, they found that if they inject two immunotherapy drugs right into the tumor, it gets rid of not only the tumor but also distance metastases. And if the cancer comes back, they do it again and it works again. And they think it should work on any solid tumor, and does not matter on the infiltrating immune cells. So for future cancers, they could imagine injecting the drugs right into the main tumor and then no more metastasis risk, in theory. But what about those of us whose tumors were already removed by surgery? Anyway, here is the link, would love some discussion! https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/01/can... ",

Other drugs are much more of a bomb.

Remember Barbara Bigelow who went through a year of treatment with the wrong drugs, you are taking the time needed to avoid that outcome. If you let us know what they suggest, we can research if there are additional treatments (for example ovarian suppression plus Femara-Ibrance, would sound fine if it is suitable, but if chemo is needed because liver mets are extensive, then how about some immunotherapy or CDK4,6 inhibitor, etc). It tooks me months to stop despairing, every time I woke up from sleep the horror would come anew, and I went onto a low-dose antidepressant which really helped, others try some anti-anxiety. Although it did help a lot I still felt the despair which made it in a way worse because I thought antidepressants were just masking the problem a bit and didn't make it go away. which was true, because what really changed me for good and made that despair disappear completely (it did!!) was when I could finally read the scientific and medical literature again ( I had avoided it all right after diagnosis), I was just in awe of how many different approaches and drugs are out there, or not even yet in trials, and that gave me real genuine hope that this disease can be treated as a true chronic condition for a lifetime, if not outright cured, in a way that seems they are so close. Real hope and being on a stable drug combo finally gave me my life back and eventually I even quit the antidepressant. \"Live my life without a safety net? well OK, I guess I can do that\" Hopefully it does not take you that long, try in some way to compartmentalize the fear and panic and focus on just how you are feeling in the moment. Easy to say, hard to do, but one foot in front of the other. Your youth gives you strength and your body really can recover and heal once they find the way to kill or arrest the cancer.",

I was following her blog from just almost the beginning, because she had the same diagnosis that I did and we were on the same drug regimen (Ibrance-Femara) and she was just a couple of months ahead of me. If you search back to her earlier posts, you will see that, like you, she completely failed her firstline regimen, and then join a clinical trial. I think there was a botched up biopsy in that it took forever to get results, but she learned about a year after she was first diagnosed that her metastatic cancer was triple-negative, rather than ER-positive, so of course the Ibrance-Femara never worked, and the clinical trial she was in would not work either, so at that point she was a year down the road and hadn't even been on any appropriate drug as yet. Extensive mets, including one that had taken out a kidney. Things looked dire. She got into a trial of immunotherapy and some kind of chemo (I forget what) that is suitable for triple-negative cancer. And she gets a port installed, so she can take the chemo. However, the port gets mildly infected, shortly after she has the immunotherapy, which turns the immune system into over-drive. Read her posts from Feb-June 2016 and you'll see how she ends up in the ER for months, almost dies of sepsis, really awful. Fever that cannot be controlled, adrenal glands and thyroid stop functioning, BP that cannot be controlled, etc.The cause is the immune system started attacking the normal cells, and led to organ failure. The docs realized this was happening because of the immunotherapy, and were able to reverse it by giving her steroids. As unlikely as it seems, cancer cells are actually more sensitive to high fever and starvation or other stresses than are regular cells, so on top of everything else she was going through, the cancer was really getting cooked for all of this time, and I remember thinking about that, and hoping it was the case, even as she was going through it. But she survived (!!), and to this day about two years later, she is on nothing in the way of meds and cancer has not come back. It could be a cure, or at the least a resounding recovery- fascinating reading https://barbigwire.com/  ",

You still have the primary tumor, so it would be good to goose up the immune system, but how? There is one trial at Mayo clinic where they add Keytruda to the Ibrance/Femara, but that clearly ithat s too far away from you- before you get it removed, you might want to try to stimulate your immune system with probiotics to get a partial immune response activation going. Am going to look up which ones, will post later Also, anti-CD47 antibodies are in clinical trial in combination with a targeted drug for colon cancer; the last two San Antonio conferences have been very disappointing in this area, not much happening?, maybe the breast cancer advocates are not pushing as hard as they should be to get it going for breast cancers. There is no reason why breast should not be 'immunogenic'. they just have to find the good biomarkers and drug combinations",

The main reason is to get the most out of immunotherapy, whenever you do get it, for which it is important to get the tumor burden as low as possible. The primary tumor must have a ton of cells and be hard for immune system to penetrate it and get all the cells out. I'm not sure but also think this is maybe why they do the bone marrow transplant technique in the NCI protocol?, ie to flush out latent transformed cells and give immunotherapy a chance to work. And hopefully it does work for you, because the PR- phenotype is luminal B, and preliminary data indicates that this subtype iis nearly as responsive as are the triple negative cancers, so hopefully some combination of immuno and other targeted drug may be in your future. Anyway, that's my 2 cents...",

It will take you a long time to learn about the different subtypes of cancer and all the many different types of treatments that exist and may be considered. But here is a link to a cancer vaccine trial that has just started at Stanford that looks promising, very early stages yet and not testing for breast cancer but could be a game-changer for all of us: https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/01/can... And there is a clinical trial at the NIH that tries a new immunotherapy and appears to have cured one metastatic breast cancer patient (Judy Perkins, you will find much press about her case): you would have to have liver mets and have previously been previously treated with chemo and drugs to be eligible, so just good to know its there in the future should you ever need it: http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-s... And here is a recent article in Time discussing the ideas of how to use immunotherapy in breast cancer: http://time.com/5415044/breast-cancer-immunology/ Lastly, the San Antonio breast conference in early December will bring a lot of news reports about how clinical trials are panning out, so there will be a lot more press about new options at that time. You won't need this info as you will be presumably going onto standard treatments, but good news about other options for future treatments is always welcome.",

It would help if you provide more information so we can formulate some ideas or provide some information- what was your initial diagnosis (ER-positive? HER2-positive? triple-negative? etc), what treatment(s) have you been on thus far? have you had genetic testing of the tumor for additional mutations that may be driving the cancer? what is your oncologist like? are they at a major cancer center? have you had second/third opinions? what is your family/friends support situation like? There is much hope in current treatments, just because the first one failed quickly does not mean the next ones won't give you long-term stability.

It also points out how the premise of the \"don't-need-to-scan\" argument, based only on \"group averages\" is completely misleading, when what we need are more sensitive tests (either scans or an accurate blood test) so it is clear when treatments need to change in our specific case. We need to get more information on which to act, not less. Pajim, Agreed about the importance of pushing to get the most out of each treatment and not changing drugs until a scan deems it necessary. In my case the hope is that the rads allow me to go longer on I/F. But even better than all of this scanning BS would be if they just hurry up with a blood test that works, and the results could be known immediately and not subject to idiosyncratic interpretations by the radiologist reading the scan, etc..",

I think it sounds like the insurance agencies again, trying to figure out a way to reduce costs. They say more frequent scans are no better for \"overall survival\", undoubtedly based on outdated data (plus, we all know how hard it is to show benefit for OS for MBC anyway, because patients live long enough to be treated with many different drugs in different sequences, hard to show an OS effect for one drug in part of a long sequence of treatments), and they argue we should all wait for \"symptoms\" to appear. I still have no symptoms, and MO suggested yearly scans. I said I'd stick with every six months, and no longer have any scananxiety when I have scans, because they are being done at my request. Although I felt fine last month, my nuclear bone scan showed progression in one pre-existing spot (evident in the previous scan, but not so active), plus another new spot, with nothing showing up in the PET/CT. I am just finishing up radiation on those two bone spots. Will this radiation make any difference? What if it does nothing to stop progression, but prevents me from major hip deterioration or pain in my spine? What if the new spot was some newly-mutated cancer and the radiation stopped it from spreading? What if the radiation got my immune system kicked into gear and it goes out and hunts down some cancer cells for another couple of months (abscopal effect)? Alternatively, what if the cancer in these locations continued unabated for six months before my next scan? To me, there are many reasons I wanted the treatment, and nobody will ever know if it helped overall survival (because n=1 patient). Makes a big difference to me, and I would not trade it for the 'convenience\" (in this case, false security) of not having to worry a bit about what a scan will show!!! I do get concerned reading some of these ideas and similar ideas floated around in the press that the future MBC patients may have fewer options that we do, if insurance companies get their way.. PS The RO ordered an MRI to confirm and more accurately map the spots, which it did, but also showed the cancer in the spine was in slightly different location to what was indicated by the nuclear bone scan",

Initially he didn't tell his doctor he was doing it, then eventually fessed up, after it was clear he was having an exceptional response and they decided to investigate why he responded so well. Because he had late-stage lung cancer, we can assume that his trial included at least one immunotherapy drug, maybe even an immuno combo. It's as if doxil or navelbine had not yet been recognized to have anti-cancer properties, and you realized that you could take them on your own without a prescription, or having to worry about any serious side effects. But would you really want to use it that way? Luce says mebendazole is offered in a clinical trial at UCSD in combination with immunotherapy- suppose they find out that their protocol works great? if you take it now, you might not be eligible to get into a trial combining it with immunotherapy These compounds look like potentially powerful drugs, I wouldn't really be comfortable munching them like a supplement. I was surprised to find that some of the CDK9-type inhibitors can also be found off-prescription in the nutritional supplement stores, apparently bodybuilders have been using them for quite awhile. UCSD is smart to offer mebendazole in a trial, because its off-patent and virtually none of their late-stage patients would have been exposed to the drug before. Plus, there are few side effects so it can be combined with immunotherapy, and what is known about the mechanism of action suggests the combo might work for a variety of cancers. OTOH, this guy took them as a supplement, during his trial, and he lucked out. People do this kind of thing all the time. I doubt vitamins or CBD oil have any magical role in the combination, but who knows? If they work great, hopefully we'll hear about the trial from the UCSD folks sometime soon..",

If it works out we will all be clamoring to get on it!! So yes, we don't know the side effects of CDK2 inhibition. The CDK4,6i SEs we all know about. Just remember three things: 1- the body can have a strong reaction that settles down after a month or two on the drug, for sure I had awful fatigue to I-F but then my body adjusted.. 2- these are very potent inhibitors, so if its truly awful, I am sure you will be making them dose-reduce. They very probably will be testing enyzmes as you take the meds, making sure the markers in the body are responding as they predict- they want to make sure the kinases are well and truly inhibited 3- It cannot be worse than chemo, gimme a break...

Celebrex had higher anti-cancer activity than statins when tested as monotherapy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18548583 The combination of these drugs given to laboratory animal models inhibited 95 percent of the colorectal tumors that developed in untreated animals, When used together, the drugs were most effective at doses substantially lower than when used alone. Using a combination of low doses of these chemopreventive agents that have differing action may be the most effective way to maximize the anti-cancer effect of the drug while also minimizing toxicity or harmful side effects. 2) it greatly helps immune cell access to the tumor, so it synergizes with immunotherapy and CAR-T therapy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28765120 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804691 3) much has been made of potential heart-related SEs, but the risks are small and no worse with than what is seen with other NSAIDs- a breast cancer clinical trial did not encounter any heart problems. Of all of the things my alternative doc recommended, Celebrex was the only thing my onc agreed with, and she was a big proponent.",

Fenbendazole anti-cancer activity was even higher when combined with taxols, or even more so when combined with drugs that inhibit glucose use. They did not try other combinations, and its effects on the immune system really should be tested. It is crazy, given how long the potent anti-cancer effects have been known, and that some people have taken the drug for 2+ years without developing major toxicities, that there is only one clinical trial testing mebendazole, as a monotherapy for pediatric brain tumors. C'mon, we can do better than this!!! PS. Okay, well in Egypt they are doing a trial to see how mebendazole affects Folfox + Avastin on colorectal cancer..

What I meant about CDK12 is that many of these drugs have cross-inhibition of other CDKs, and therefore the drug you will be taking may also be inhibiting CDK12. If they haven't tested for that specifically, then nobody knows, and certainly not anybody on the team doling it out, for sure, so I would not assume they know the drug is a bust, not nearly enough people have taken it. Basically the bigger question with this or any drug, nowadays, is it doing anything to the tumor immunosuppresive environment? We know that Ibrance does help, but we havent heard anything from trials meant to determine if it allows immunotherapy to work better for MBC. Adding in yet another CDK, in a different formulation, what can this drug do to help that , more important, part of the equation? Enjoy your week off!!!!",

Apparently they cannot advertise but some of the patients who signed up have done well. No clinical trials, but they want to offer a supplement benefit using drugs like these that do not have a standard role in cancer therapy. And at least they know the standard dose to take. Keep in mind, these patients take this treatment as a supplement, in addition to the standard oncology treatments, not as a standalone treatment. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/cr... https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3115964...

So the study you cite, adding everolimus, doubles the fulvestrant response to 10-11 months, which seems similar to the Alpelisib plus fulvestrant studies. And it seems they have applied to FDA for approval for Alpelisib, so that may soon be an option we can get from our own docs, not need to join a trial. Both drugs hit the same extended pathway (PI3K/mTOR) at different spots. Both drugs come with problematic side effects, but when we need to get that pathway, we have to choose something. I would favor starting Alpelisib just because of hearing the oncologists say they have the occasional patient who really responds well- my oncologist says she has patients who have also done very well on AA, but we haven't heard much of that on these boards. The rip on these drugs is they can do very well at the start but you don't get the long duration, and there was a study on the cell lines that showed they work a lot better if combined with an inhibitor to Aurora A kinase, so perhaps there will be a clinical trial start up using these drugs in combination, maybe combining at lower dosage if there is synergy, to make them more tolerable. For these drugs to work best, the cancer should have PI3K mutation- but how do they determine that if they can't get enough material from bone mets to sequence? So I think we also have to watch out for circulating tumor cell or ctDNA analysis, so they can see if we need the drug and also use the tests to see more quickly if we are responding..",

      "Content": "Dec 12, 2018 10:58PM - edited Dec 12, 2018 10:59PM by Cure-ious Interesting question! I am also so encouraged by SandiLee's success, esp as we share a similar cancer subtype (Er+PR-), so hope I can be like you! It seems you started on just Faslodex alone? My question is can you get Foundation One sequencing and testing if the progression remains only in bones, or do you have to wait for tissue mets? Or are there circulating tumor cell assays available now? And with bone progression, can they radiate or do they have to move to the next treatment. My oncologist has indicated that she just moves to Faslodex alone for secondline, but the trials indicate a PFS of only about six months, so its not surprising, Dorimak, that you progressed so fast. And for SandiLee, the second try of faslodex was with a CDK4,6 inhibitor and it came after some chemo, so the cancer was exposed to different things that allowed the estrogen-dependence to re-emerge. This is why it is so helpful to be able to see the different sequence of treatments. So, SandiLee, you are about 71/2 years since diagnosis and have been on Abemaciclib and Faslodex for the past six months?! That is very heartening, that the side effects must be so much less than on chemo and you can be on such a treatment when you are years from diagnosis. Plus there are other treatments you have not tried yet, like the Alpelisib, and somehow you avoided the Aromasin-Affinitor? (good job!!), a CDK12 inhibitor, Venetoclax, and the others working their way into the system. Plus immunotherapy when they figure out a combo that works. Sandi, what does your oncologist say about how well you are doing? You must be his/her star patient!! Do you seek out a second opinion at every change? From what I have read, estrogen resistance arises due to PI3K mutation about 40% of the time, and from ESR1 mutations about 27% of the time (or both are also common), and due to conversion to HER2-positive about 20% of the time, with triple-negative and triple-positive and other changes (FGFR) etc also possible but with lesser frequency. So it would be important to sequence to know why the cancer has progressed, especially wouldn't it be great to discover it mutated to HER2-positive and now you can take all of those other drugs?!",

Preferably at a major cancer center/university hospital and for sure by someone who specialized in breast cancers. And it would help for you to get more specific feedback if you give us your history of when you got the diagnosis of metastasis and if this is your firstline treatment? It seems that many on these boards try Halaven or Xeloda before moving to IV chemos, and there are many targeted drugs that can be tried before that, Moreover, there is some excellent stuff in clinical trials, and they will take exquisite care monitoring your cancer and give you a lot of info about how you are doing. For example, the cancer may have developed a PI3K mutation, in which case you would want to try Alpelisib with Faslodex or AA, or it could have switched to become Her2-positive or even triple negative- did they do a BIOPSY and sequencing? For sure get a second opinion and maybe even a third one (if the second one differs from your current doctor's opinion) - this is a very consequential time, when changing to chemos. And of course you are in shock and panicking, but the extra month or so it takes to figure out the very next best step forward for you is time well-spent and can make a big difference in how you fare going forward. PS Leee, same advice for you!! Everyone freaks out, but second opinions can have huge impact and doctors have no problems with you getting a second set of eyes to look at all the scans, etc",

You'll see tha if the ER has mutated (which happens 25-40% of the time) it becomes permanently activated, and pushes the cancer cells to grow whether or not they see any estrogen, so in a case like that, an estrogen competitor like tamoxifen won't work, and you'd want faslodex. I wish they'd discuss how we are supposed to know if a PI3K mutation happened, instead of an ER mutation, and now that cancer cares about PI3K/mTOR signaling and doesn't use estrogen at all to grow. In those cases, we would want an affinitor/aromasin or some PI3K inhibitor in a trial, in order to block that pathway, and force the cancer to revert to the old ER-driven pathway, making the cells re-gain sensitivity to AIs http://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/cdk46-inhibi...",

Another drug you can ask about is Taselisib or GDC-0077 (or Alpelisib) as examples of drugs targeting PI3K, the latest phase 3 results of which will be in the headlines on Saturday. You have not had affinitor/aromasin? which hits mTOR in the same pathway, but anyway the data from Sandpiper indicated that they also got responses from women who had previously failed A/A. So that Taselisib could be on your list for future too? Do they take additional biopsies at this point to see what you are dealing with?",

Until then, we are stuck with affinitor as the only drug available in this category. The GDC-0077 results have yet to weigh in, perhaps there will be a bigger benefit, but the blood sugar is a big problem for these drugs. For what its worth, they say even people on it a short period of time benefit because it does rapidly degrade the mutant PI3K, and causing your cancer to go back to being estrogen-dependent.",

      "Content": "Nov 17, 2018 10:38PM - edited Nov 17, 2018 10:48PM by Cure-ious For Katty (and interested others): I am cross-posting a comment I just put up on the Ibrance thread. Katty, this is to show, for example, that your biopsy might show a CDK12 mutation, which could mean that the cancer might be responsive to the Nivolumab-Yervoy immunotherapy combination. I think we should all ask for this mutation to be tested in new biopsies. And if not mutated, then hopefully the CDK12 targeted inhibitor does the same thing! In addition, other mutations, such as in the MMR genes or genomic instability pathways would also indicate a cancer that could respond well to immunotherapy. I was surprised to see this clinical trail (phase one) pop up, because some of the strongest supporting data comes a paper that was published in Cell not very long ago (June 2018)! Either the drug companies knew of these results from their own studies earlier, or it really shows how fast they can set up a clinical trial when they really want to do it. The paper showed that a small number of metastatic prostate cancer patients have a subtype of cancer that carries a CDK12 mutation. CDK12 mutations have been found to happen with some regularity in metastatic breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, and indeed the data suggest that mutating CDK12 may play a role in how these cells became metastatic. The Cell paper (link below) reported that CDK12 mutations make the cancer 'hot' to immunotherapy pre-clinically (in mice) and then they even went into the data from clinical trials and found that 2 of the only 3 metastatic prostate patients who had a big response to immunotherapy happened to be the ones who had the CDK12 mutation. Because the CDK12 mutations only happen in a small number of metastatic prostate cancers, the correlation is way larger than you would expect by chance, and indicates that loss of CDK12 kinase activity can make tumors become immunologically \"hot\" and responsive to immunotherapy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29906450 https://www.genengnews.com/topics/omics/new-prosta... https://www.pcf.org/news/new-study-identifies-anot... Below is a link to the trial- it is open to prostate as well as ANY type of cancer that is found by genetic sequencing to have a mutation in CDK12. In this trial they are treating with a combination of two checkpoint immunotherapy drugs (Nivolumab and Yervoy) targeting PD1 and CTLA4. Patients have to have the CDK12 mutation and measurable disease (ie liver or lung mets, etc). For reasons I don't understand the trial is only being done at Univ of Michigan, but says the sponsors are UCSF and Memorial Sloan Kettering. This may be a case where the academics decided to fund it themselves? Interesting the doctor in charge of the trial (Alva) is listed as one of the co-authors of the Cell paper! And it includes work done by the national stand up 2 cancer prostate team... https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03570619 CDK12 mutations occur in a ( relatively small) number of MBC patients, both triple-negative and HR-positive- in addition, the gene encoding CDK12 kinase lies right next to the HER2 gene, so patients who have gene-ampified HER2 (which is most of the patients expressing high levels of HER2) often have high levels of CDK12. High levels of CDK12 could be just as bad as no levels of CDK12, but it hasn't been studied yet, but they should at least benefit from a CDK12 inhibitor drug. This is also important for those of us who do not have a CDK12 mutation, because CDK12 inhibitor drugs are making their way into trials, and they will block CDK12 activity in cancer cells. If the drugs are tolerated and effective, it means that we could all be benefitting from immunotherapy, either those who have a CDK12 mutation in their cancer or others taking a targeted CDK12 inhibitor drug. The immune response they observed with the prostate cancer patients was quite strong, because the cancer cells deprived of CDK12 were found to express proteins on their cell surface that attracted the immune system to come in and kill them.",

(but that the rest of us would love to see). Ask them what to expect, what happened to the others who tried the drug- for sure, ask if it has the diarrhea side effect that Abemaciclib has? You want to know that, so you can be prepared with loperamide, but hopefully it doesn't (Abemaciclib is a really different drug). It may well have the immunostimulatory effect of the CDK4,6 inhibitors, potentially even stronger, so that your immune system will take out a bunch more cancer cells as well. Also, because the formulation for this drug is so strong (100 times stronger than Ibrance! Ten times stronger than Abemaciclib! And hits CDK2 even harder!) that you may not need very much to get the maximum benefit, so you should also assess whether you might have even FEWER side effects than Ibrance, for example. And you aren't taking an estrogen inhibitor, so you won't have the arthritis side effects that come with that. I am more concerned about adding on the dog dewormer meds, altho I think you said you were going to wait to at least see what happens with the new drug first ? Just remember the fenbendazole can be hard on the liver, and nobody knows the side effects that will develop if taken for long periods of time.

Also there is kattysmith's Opodivo + EP4 trial, which nobody else has joined yet- but, hey, it's worked well for her- and if you get a response on Immunotherapy it seems that everything else you try later on works better too!",

Try to sort them into different groups and tackle each one in its time and best way, ie grieving your husband, worrying about your son, making your doctor appointments and decisions, retire or not, move or not, etc, etc. No promises, but it is not crazy at all to think you will still be here in ten years, and possibly for many more years beyond that as the treatments are changing fast. As you sift through your problems, also build in extra free time for yourself, obviously the stronger and happier you are, the better it will be for everyone. So far as I can tell, CTCA takes a lot of money from early and late-stage cancer patients who are willing to pay extra for treatment that might not be any different (or even as good) as the advice and treatment you will get from a major teaching university hospital- just takes some research to find the group near you that handles regional clinical trials and is familiar with new therapies. You will have to get a biopsy done, and re-done every time you have progression (because the cancer will have mutated and changed in order to escape the drugs) and always get a second opinion for what next treatment is best, but beyond that you can treat this as you would for any other chronic condition. Things will get a lot better, after the shock and awe wears off..",

The big potential upside is it can have amazing results, as evidenced by that MBC patient who is in remission more than two years now and taking nothing for her cancer. Regarding the low response to immunotherapy- usually those numbers are for immunotherapy alone, and the benefit goes up if given in combination with another treatment (chemo, drug, radiation), or if given in combination with a different type of immunotherapy. Also, as cancer mutates more and more to be able to grow around the drugs, it becomes more aggressive but also more readily recognized as aberrant by the immune system and therefore might be more responsive to immunotherapy. So your odds of responding may be greater than the numbers you read about, on the other hand of course it might do nothing- this is the black magic of deciding which dugs to take when no-one can say whether or not we will respond. On the pro side, the side effects are low and potential for meaningful benefit , if you do respond, is high.",

It seems you have not yet tried Halaven or Abemaciclib? Abemaciclib and Keytruda is an up-and-coming combination currently in phase I testing- the reason is that CDK4/6 inhibitors like Abemaciclib or Ibrance were found to lower the protein level of PD1/PDL1, the protein that is a target of immunotherapy like Keytruda. So the Abemaciclib could lower the level of the protein that the immunotherapy monoclonal antibody wants to inactivate- and in preclinical studies, the combo is synergistic, better than either alone. So if you can take Abemaciclib (it is FDA approved and you would want that over Ibrance because it is has activity on its onw, and works on brain mets) along with the Keytruda, that would be great. And still low side effects, so maybe even throw something else in... And then Halaven, supposed to work so well on liver, you haven't had that yet?",

You are learning so much each time, and have shown it is possible to mix this treatment in with your other standard of care drugs. It is like a big test supplementary procedure. I agree with your MO, our diets are not the reason we have MBC and will not save us. If metastasis needs asparagine, trying to leave it out of our diet is very unlikely to work, the cancer has tons of ways to scavenge what it needs from our body. And for breast cancers that run on estrogen, deprive them of estrogen of course, but trying to deprive them of sugar by not eating cookies or ice cream is doing nothing, sugar is not what they most need to drive growth and is so easy to get in the body. MZR- Thanks for weighing in with your valuable perspective. The more of these stories, the merrier! JFL- I'd second the support you are getting for the interesting FGFR1 trial- it was discussed in a recent OncLive video, and both oncs mentioned that they were excited that the phase 2 part of that trial was coming to their institutions. Is for only if you have the mutation, but the drugs have been shown to be strong in other contexts, and might offer a better way forward than the mTOR/PI3K drugs from Affinitor to second gen drugs, all of which seem to have their limitations. It is being expanded bigtime in phase 2, which is a sign that somebody is hoping its going to be big. I wanted to write a quick update about the CD47 monoclonal antibodies in development some of you are following as a different kind of immunotherapy. Last fall there was a new report saying that MHC class I molecules also act like CD47, in that they are a way for cancer cells to hide from the immune system. I have not read the original report, but the press release said the combination of anti-CD47 and anti-MHC was even stronger than each alone in pre-clinical, but it also mentions that in cancers that have low MHC and may not be very sensitive to checkpoint inhibitors, they might instead be expected to be sensitive to CD47, so maybe that will be the case for our cancers?- Anyway, this technology seems to be going slowly in that trials are not underway for MBC, with immunotherapy we will always come last, but they nevertheless are something to keep on the radar.

I was just reading a bit about the FGFR data- AMPLIFICATION of the FGFR gene (where the cancer cells have extra copies of the gene) is more common than having MUTATION of the FGFR protein. The data indicate that amplification of the FGFR gene more clearly indicates that it is actually driving the growth of those cancer cells, whereas FGFR mutations are less common, and depending on what exact mutation it is, may or may not affect the growth of the cancer So read your genomic analysis carefully to see if you have amplification or mutation of FGFR- I believe that to qualify for the trial I mentioned above you would have to have FGFR-AMPLIFIED metastatic breast cancer (and should also still be classified ER-positive, HER2-negative). So the idea is that FGFR ampification may help the cancer to resist the Ibrance-Femara, and the trial is checking if a good next treatment would be Faslodex (to overcome the Femara resistance) in combination with the FGFR inhibitor (to block growth of the resistant cells and restore sensitivity to Ibrance) and Ibrance. In the clip, they mention this FGFR inhibitor is potent and that the pre-clinical data looked good at the San Antonio 2017 meeting. ",

Because you were not on any particular treatment for a really long time, I'm not sure the cancer has mutated lots extra, other than it was already highly mutated perhaps- did you have any genetic testing done on the liver tumors? My suggestion for you, not currently available but coming soon, is a combination of Halaven with a CXCR4 inhibitor. Phase I trial for that one had 63% response rate (stable or better) and 36% saw tumors shrink. 6 of 24 were still on the drugs at the end of the trial, and there was no apparent difference between those heavily treated or earlier in their treatments. I hope the Opodivo and radiation synergize greatly, and perhaps this or other trials will look good afterwards.

They have been going on for awhile, so we should go read up on this to see what success these trials are having... For triple-negative, there are some targeted inhibitors in development- one is an inhibitor to CDK7 (similar to Ibrance, which targets CDK4 and CDK6), with the difference being that CDK7 is especially important for triple negative (hasn't been tested in triple positive). You can easily imagine a CDK7 inhibitor combined with immunotherapy and other drugs, too. These are heading for clinical trials, and I see that there are also other options already in clinical trials we have not discussed, but in earlier stage than IMMUN132. So, you have not come to the end of the treatment options here! But, of course.

If and when CDK12 inhibitors become available they should work well in combination with PARP inhibitors on all breast cancers, because the CDK12 inhibitors will eliminate BRCA expression, regardless of whether the person has the BRCA mutation.

We all understood how desperate she was to live, and nobody had any answers, it was just so profoundly sad. For all- I heard yesterday of a paper coming out in Nature to the effect that cancer cells differ from normal cells in that they lack an internal circadian 'rhythm' ( in normal cells, certain sets of genes can strongly change their expression level up or down in a regular pattern during the day/night cycle- and this does not happen in a screwed up cancer cell). When researchers restored the circadian rhythm, the cells could not handle it and died. The drug they used to restore it was an REV-ERB-alpha drug, and the test was in glioblastoma, because the current versions of that drug cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate to their highest levels up in the brain.

I will go look up other Abraxane combinations that might be worth considering. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4 months with Abraxane plus carboplatin compared with 5.4 months for Abraxane plus gemcitabine and six months for gemcitabine plus carboplatin. The 12-month PFS rate was 27 percent with Abraxane/carboplatin compared with 13 percent and 11 percent for Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine/carboplatin, respectively. \"I think it's an exciting study because there's such a role for doublet therapy, particularly in the triple-negative population. There's a lot of controversy between sequential single-agent or doublet therapy,\" said lead investigator Denise A. Yardley, M.D., senior investigator at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. \"The Abraxane/carboplatin arm in this phase 2 study came out demonstrating the ideal efficacy pattern for the triple-negative population.\" The phase 2 study randomized 191 untreated patients with metastatic TNBC to receive the combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine (66 patients) or Abraxane with carboplatin (64 patients) or gemcitabine (61 patients). Abraxane was administered at 125 mg/m2, carboplatin at AUC2, and gemcitabine was given at 1000 mg/m2. In each arm, treatment was administered on day one and eight every three weeks. Patient characteristics were well balanced between the arms. Patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and the majority were enrolled in North America (about 48 percent) and Western Europe (38 percent to 46 percent). A quarter of patients had a disease-free interval less than one year. The most common site of metastases were the lymph nodes (62 percent to 78 percent). Two-thirds of patients had received prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) with Abraxane/carboplatin was 72 percent, which consisted of seven complete responses (CR; 11 percent) and 39 partial responses (PR; 61 percent). The ORR was 39 percent with Abraxane/gemcitabine and 44 percent with gemcitabine/carboplatin. The CR rate in each of these arms was 8 percent. Twenty-two percent of patients had stable disease for at least 16 weeks in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm compared with 44 percent and 32 percent in the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine/carboplatin arms, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.4 months with Abraxane/carboplatin compared with 12.1 months with Abraxane/gemcitabine and 12.6 months for gemcitabine/carboplatin.

Apparently it is not high levels of RET or RET mutations, but rather look for an increase in the expression of the RET ligand- basically any one of these proteins: GDNF, ARTN, or NRTN If you have progression on AIs, and either of these three genes is highly expressed by genomics analysis of the biopsy (no idea if companies test for them), then in principle you might respond to the new RET drug LOXO-292",

The trial does monitor serum FGFR levels and will be looking to see if the degree of amplification correlates with how well the drug works, so it is possible they might know rather quickly whether the drug is at least working to reduce FGFR over-expression (and then scans will say whether reducing FGFR correlates with stable disease outcome)...",

From the conclusion: Eventually all patients will be treated with checkpoint inhibitors, either directly or after interventions targeting inflammation, by vaccination to boost T cell repertoires, or by adoptive T cell transfer. The majority of patients will subsequently develop acquired resistance followed by immune escape; this will lead to the next cycle of treatments incorporating multi-modal biomarkers (e.g., based on microbiome phenotype, ctDNA, circulating cytokine levels) and perhaps NK cells recognizing loss of MHC class I by neoplastic cells, thus rendering them invisible to T cells. Cytotoxic treatments, such as with NK cells, standard CTX/RT or oncolytic viruses, will release neo-antigens that can be used to generate the next round of effector T cells.",

PARP inhibitor plus immunotherapy gave a 52% overall response rate, which is high, the one downside being that it is only for BRCA-mutant HER2-negative MBC. - however we should be hopeful about this. When CDK12 inhibitors get into trials, they wipe out expression of BRCA gene. So adding a CDK12 inhibitor to the PARP inhibitor makes all cancer cells behave like BRCA-mutant cells, and respond to this therapy. They just have to hurry up the CDK12 inhibitors to trials (every pharma has a project on this ongoing)",

Nobody lives forever, and I had a neighbor decades ago, a young woman who developed gastric cancer during her second pregnancy (was scanned and diagnosed a week after childbirth), and she went through three surgeries just to get her organs functioning- after each one the surgeon said \"no more treatment\", and she went and found another doctor who would do it- she died three days after the final surgery, in incredible pain, screaming in pain between rounds of her self-administered morphine, because that is what happens if you fight cancer to the great extent that she did. Of course she was desperate to have any time with her newborn and young daughter, but it was all for naught and just a terrible way to go, the costs were also so high her husband had to sell the house and move in with relatives (and ironically, he died a year later in a car crash). I am such a wimp about pain, it won't take a whole lot of it to convince me when it's time to go. Which is why I am very happy, surprised and encouraged to hear you are not in debilitating pain!!! And able to kick back and enjoy the days, too? (well, I guess so long as you are out of the hospital). Please keep posting when you can, and thanks for all of your many contributions to all of us!!",

Dana-Farber is about to start studying her, to see if they can figure out why she responded so well, although her situation was unique and so we cannot replicate but it shows that it IS possible. She has been off all meds for her cancer for I think about two years now, and I'd say she is a good candidate for a second cured person. In her case, she was originally misdiagnosed-- they thought was she was still ER-positive like her primary tumor was, but in reality it had mutated and she was triple negative, and there was some prolonged problem getting the information from her biopsy, so she ended up taking 10months of Ibrance-Femara with no benefit. In her blog you can search through older posts, and I'd suggest to pick it up Jan 2016 and read at least the next six months, and then up at the top are the current posts- she went into a clinical trial at Dana-Faber for Halaven and Keytruda. She also had a port installed. But by chance the port became mildly infected, and caused the immunotherapy to make her immune system go into overdrive, attacking her healthy organs. She had fever and BP out of control, kidney dialysis and on a respirator and nearly died. They realized what was happening and dropped the Keytruda and gave her steroids, and eventually she survived. But cancer cells are relatively more fragile than normal cells, and it seems they were cooked well and good. She has been on no meds since, and her doctors are tentatively considering her maybe cured or at least on a very long remission. Here is a link to her blog, where you join the part of the story that was developing in 2016: https://barbigwire.com/2016/01/01/triple-xxx-histo... PS One interesting tidbit from her posts; her docs say she is the one who responded best in the trial (duh) but also that they have seen stronger immunotherapy responses from patients who originally were ER-positive and then mutated to triple-negative, so there must be something different genetically about those kinds of tumors.

And then why do they say you are maybe HER2 positive? Apparently if you are both HER2 and ER positive, you should always take both an anti-HER2 PLUS an AI, because the anti-HER2 causes the estrogen receptor to become more active, and just an AI alone can push the HER2 to use that pathway, gotta block both of them, for triple positive. I'm going back to the abstracts to look for updates on oncolytic viruses, your post reminded me that they even exist.. Thriving: I second everything Zar told you- and duh yeah insist on immuno!! In combination with either other immuno or chemo or anything else. There are different kinds, you can try checkpoint inhibitors now and then anti-CD47 later. Also keep an eye out for updates from clinical trials for CDK7 or CDK12 inhbiitors, in development. PARP inhibitors are for BRCA mutant cancers, but if you are treated with a CDK12 inhibitor, then ANYONE will be able to go onto a PARP inhibitor at the same time, because CDK12 inhibitors cause a loss in BRCA expression and make any cancer sensitive to PARP inhibition, so the potential is we could all be able to benefit from drugs like Olaparib.

The development of small molecular inhibitors that target RET allows the opportunity to consider combination therapies as a strategy to improve response to treatment and to prevent and combat endocrine resistance. The data suggest that upregulation of RET is one way ER-positive cells can become resistant to AIs, and that inhibition of RET could restore estrogen dependence on the cancer. However, I am not seeing how common or rare is RET upregulation? Apparently the drug is highly effective, specific, tolerated and works on brain mets (but these are early days..). I guess, for those of you who have had your tumors analyzed genetically check if there's anything about RET, might keep an eye on this drug...",

Was there anything in ASCO this year positive for MBC- the headlines have been Ibrance drugs for like five years now, time for some breakthroughs. And no immuno combos to highlight for ER-positive disease. Very disappointing. Plus, ASCO puts out a press release sounding like this is good news!! Here is the ASCO 2018 \"news release\" that they picked as such a winner among all of their abstracts to highlight in a press release today: June 2, 2018 New Targeted Therapy Slows Growth of Advanced Breast Cancer CHICAGO \u2013 In a phase III clinical trial, a new targeted medicine, taselisib, combined with standard hormone therapy fulvestrant (Faslodex®), halted the growth of advanced breast cancer growth by 2 months longer than hormone therapy alone, and decreased the chance of cancer worsening by 30%. Taselisib targets a common genetic abnormality in breast cancer \u2013 PIK3CA gene mutation \u2013 and is the first and most potent treatment in a relatively new class of PI3K inhibitors, according to the authors. Versus here is what is actually happening, Roche is dropping Taselisib and will not take it to FDA for approval, because the results suck and the drug only extended what you get with Faslodex alone by two months http://whtc.com/news/articles/2018/jun/02/roche-dr...

Most people aren't interested, only a few percentage of cancer patients ever do a trial, they want to plug along with standard of care, and for all practical purposes, historically, the outcome following standard of care was probably not much worse than for those in trials, but now there are so many new drugs and new approaches that bring in immunotherapy, its easy to hope that some wonderful results might be found in a trial. Some of those women who tried the trial combining Ibrance with AIs are still reaping the benefits years later! I wish we could join any trial we wanted through our own MO, just say sign me up, I want to try the drug combo you are testing, and monitor/scan me as often as you like, rather than making us go to some other location and transfer records to a different doctor just to participate in the trial.

Today I was at a grant panel and there was excitement about combining PPAR-gamma agonists, the sort of exercise-in-a-pill drugs, with immunotherapy. The idea is that bad diet and lack of exercise give rise to systemic inflammation, which these drugs fight. Reminds me of the EP4 inhibitors that kattysmith is taking with immunotherapy, they are designed to get rid of the inflammation, which helps the immune cells find and destroy the tumor.",

It tests venetoclax, an inhibitor of BCL2, which is upregulated in most MBC cancers, together with faslodex on patients who previously were treated with CDK4,6 inhibitors. Its early days for phase 1b trial, however they say they are seeing benefits and toxicity is mostly just neutrophils- they are likening it to ibrance trials, but I'd like to see some solid PFS numbers before getting too excited about it. Maybe they will have more to say next week, but at least this is a trial that is consistently reporting, they last spoke at San Antonio last December. Venetoclax is used in blood cancers, I think this might be the first solid tumor trial using this drug. The newer trial is with faslodex whereas in the first trial they tested it with tamoxifen. http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/9/... PS However, if this trial has PFS that is equal or better than Alpelisib-Faslodex, I would prefer the venetoclax combo due to fewer side effects. It seems to work on ESR1 and PI3K mutant cancers too. Might become a good secondline option. PPS This is a phase 2 trial with several US sites (Mayo Clinic, UCSD) as well as multiple sites in Australia, Canada, UK, Germany, France: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03584... ",

As Shetland says, you might have some mocrosattelite instability, and another way you could be inherently responsive to immunotherapy would be if your cancer has a CDK12 mutation (about 5% of breast, prostate and ovarian cancers do), because that mutation increases PDL1 expression. I was just looking at a trial at UCSF that involves Dinacyclib, which is a CDK inhibitor that inhibits several CDKs, and is a really good inhibitor of CDK12- taking this drug should be like having a mutation in CDK12, in that the cancer should becomessensitive to immunotherapy. The trial at UCSF tests Dinacyclib with Keytruda (immunotherapy), and so far is just for triple-negative, but if this combo works, it could very well work great for ER-positive tumors as well, so its worth keeping an eye on how it does- perhaps there will be a report at ASCO- other CDK12 inhibitors that are more selective are making their way into clinical trials, though, so they might drop the Dinaciclib here is a link:Phase 1b, started June 2016 and trial will be over in Aug 2019  ",

You also indicated that your doctors thought you would respond to this trial. It would be unusual for them to think that you would respond to immunotherapy because you are ER-positive, however it's possible that the genetic sequencing of your cancer showed high expression of PDL1 in the tumor, or mismatch repair mutations- basically, there are a few known mutations that can make cancers respond to immunotherapy- but they are rare. The above-listed trial is offered at MD Anderson, so it seems right. However, you asked your MO for more information and he sent you a statement that the trial is based on the idea that EP4 inhibitors can makes immunotherapy work in cancers that normally do not respond (which is the case for the vast majority of ER-positive patients). Moreover, I noticed that there is a trial of Opodivo with an EP4 inhibitor, and it is also offered at MD Anderson Is it possible that this is the trial you are on? https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03661...

The drug strongly blocks CDK2, as well as CDK4,6. Increased CDK2 activity (due to elevated levels of its activator, Cyclin E) is the most common way MBCs become resistant to Ibrance. The hope is that Inhibiting CDK2, make the cancer sensitive to Ibrance again- good luck!",

A cure or functional equivalent could be just around the corner. The docs say the patients who do the best dealing with this diagnosis are the ones who are naturally sanguine (I had to look up what that means- to be optomistic or confident, despite apparently dire circumstances) so perhaps you can assume you won't have problems in the early going, and that the later parts of it will be worked out by the time you get there, and jump back into your wonderful life!",

As we have discussed on earlier threads, the PI3K mutations are the most common mutation that crops up as breast cancer become resistant to any of various therapies. But the problem has been to get an inhibitor that works better and with far fewer side effects than a drug like Affinitor. Your trial will test a new PI3K alpha-subunit specific inhibitor, alone or with Ibrance-Femara. I don't see much info out about this new drug, other than a short report that just came out last month: A structure-, property-, and phenotype-guided strategy directed at high PI3K-isoform and PIKK-family selectivity, as well as a distinct cellular mechanism of action, culminated in the discovery of GDC-0077. Differences in primary and tertiary structure among PI3K isoforms were leveraged to achieve >300-fold selective inhibition of the PI3Kα isoform over the β, δ, and γ isoforms in biochemical assays. Very high selectivity over PIKK-family proteins such as mTOR, DNA-PK and VPS34 was also achieved through this process. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that GDC-0077 operates by a mechanism that promotes the selective degradation of \"hotspot\" p110α mutants (H1047R, E545K). Treatment of nude mice bearing PIK3CA-mutant breast tumor xenografts with oral GDC-0077 resulted in tumor regressions at well-tolerated doses. Together, the high degree of isoform selectivity, selective degradation of mutant-p110α, and in vivo PK/efficacy support the clinical evaluation of GDC-0077 as a treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic, PIK3CA-mutant cancer. Basically, this drug is supposed to go in and degrade the mutant PI3K that is driving your cancer cell growth. As with all drugs, the cancer will eventually find a way to mutate some other protein and keep growing, however the stronger the drug, and hopefully the benefit of combining it with other drugs like Ibrance, will beat it back for a very long time. Best of luck and we are all with you!",

No wonder that so many MOs have been saying that the genetic testing isn't often suggesting new treatments. And even if the tests agreed on a mutation, it doesn't mean that mutation or amplification is what is driving the growth of the cancer, there are lots of oncogenes, and they can be amplified, mutated, or the protein products can be modified or regulated in many ways differently from the mRNAs anyway so you'd want proteomics in addition to the genomics. Easier to just try something and see. It's always been a crapshoot, we just need more rapid and sensitive ways to see if the drugs are working, and for how long. For me, I'd want to try some kind of Abemaciclib combo, with Keytruda in that trial or with faslodex and Keytruda, because I wouldn't want to give up anti-hormonals until I knew I had to, and certainly not based on possible alterations of FGF signaling... The recent Nature papers showed that Ibrance/Abemaciclib lower levels of PDL-1 protein- What happens is that CDK4/6 proteins are needed to make PDL-1 stable, and when inhibited the PDL-1 levels drop because the protein gets degraded. Therefore, Ibrance/Abemaciclib should work synergistically with checkpoint inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies like Keytruda or Atezo) because the former lower the level of PDL-1 and then the antibodies can more effectively inhibit what's left. And that just how it works in pre-clinical studies, but we'll have to wait and see if it works in human trials or whether breast cancers are too 'cold' and need something qualitatively different to make them 'hot'",

And really?! now they are trying to make the argument that there is no benefit to overall survival to taking AIs for more than two years after primary breast cancer? Their new idea: save your bones and avoid fractures? How smart (NOT!)- all of this just sounds like insurance talking! And then the other idea I read is that immunotherapy has its best shot, which pretty much sucks regardless, when given as part of the firstline treatment, so don't wait too long, the tumors are getting immunologically colder and colder the more they progress. Well, that's all depressing. So, thanks for your more hopeful news, even tho they are only testing in NSCLC. Pre-clinical data might also suggest that the strategy you are proposing here might work much better if the original primary tumor remains in the body. Then radiaiton can blast all kinds of cells loose and immunotherapy can tee off on those cells to create that vaccine-like environment. Do radiation early and often? we'll see, might work...

They say if they compare the plus-Keytruda trial response to what they saw in the Abemaciclib-alone trial at the same time point (ie, at 4 months in), the plus- Keytruda trial already has double the number of responders. That's because the response can take six months or so to show clearly. So IF the difference they are seeing now were to hold up all the way to when the trial has fully matured, it would mean that rather than having a total of 19% of patients responding (which is what they got in the Abemaciclib-alone phase 1 trial), they might have closer to 40% responding in the Keytruda-Abemaciclib trial, which would be a big difference. Of course, it can go the other direction, too!! The one year update will be more meaningful.",

Because it is direct injection into the tumor, only low levels of these compounds are used, and hence there should be relatively few side effects.Testing in mice, this was an incredibly effective vaccine, and the supercharged T cells eliminated both tumors and distant metastases in mice. basically, the system relies on T cells already in the tumor to have the appropriate antigens to hunt and seek out similar cancer cells in the body. A small clinical trial is underway to test it in lymphoma, but in principle, if it works, it could be a vaccine that works on all kinds of solid tumors.... https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-stanfo...

We posit overexpression of cyclin D1 induced by both FGFR signaling and ER transcription plays a role in drug resistance. Based on these findings we propose ER+/FGFR1 amplified breast cancers are endocrine resistant and should be candidates for treatment with combinations of ER and FGFR antagonists. Accordingly, we have initiated a phase Ib trial of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in patients with antiestrogen resistant ER+/HER2-negative breast cancer with FGFR1-4 amplification. Basically they are saying that one common way to get resistance of cancer to Ibrance-Femara is to increase FGFR, which turns on Cyclin D (an activator of CDK4,6) and therefore the cells have elevated CDK4,6 activity and can grow in the presence of Ibrance. So they are suggesting that if you get rid of the increased FGFR activity in these cells, then the Cyclin D levels will go back down, and the CDK4,6 activity will go down to normal levels, at which point it can now be effectively inhibited by Ibrance as it was before the FGFR got amplified.",

It must help somewhat to understand the biology of how you are altering your own metabolism to make the chemo as effective as possible. The potential for fasting to alter the response of the body to drugs is huge, huge. I remember reading a paper that said if you give metformin to a fasted (nutrient-depleted) cell, it is 1000x more effective than a cell happily growing in high glucose. That makes sense, its easier to reduce sugar if sugar is low, but 1000x?! Similarly, there was a study that showed that fasting every evening from 6:30pm (water only) till 8am the next morning is good for a 1.5 point reduction in A1C levels for diabetics, which is something they can't even get out of most drugs! The point for that kind of nighttime fast is to get the sugar out of your system, then after an hour or so you are burning fat. So eat any thing you want in the day, but give yourself a long fast to burn it off. The body also really likes regular schedules, so the longer you do this kind of 'fast', the quicker the body adapts to the idea of the fast and responds- your circadian rhythms tighten way up. I have a friend who fasts for fun when he is traveling, he just wants to see how the fast protects him from jet lag etc. Fast a day or so before hand, just nibble on the plane, then eat a big breakfast and have coffee and sit outside in the sunshine on the mornings wherever you have landed, he swears by that.. In your case, you are weakening the cancer cells and waking them up and them out of their sleepy rhythms, right when low-dose chemo is about to hit them, and I'd be you'll get the effectiveness of a much higher dose of chemo, and perhaps much more widespread. We shall see, but I am also very interested to hear whether you think you can bounce back quicker from the effects of the chemo, because your normal cells were more resistant to it. You are protecting your body with the fast, and sensitizing the cancer cells to be killed by the chemo. Afterwards, you can slowly start eating/drinking and clearing out the chemo drug, you may have some nausea anyway, so I'm guessing that part won't be so hard. Good luck tomorrow!!",

They seem to think that you want chemo followed by an AI plus anti-HER2, and they also talk about Nerlynx (not sure what that is, but something relatively new): Extended therapy with Nerlynx was especially helpful in those with ER-positive disease. On this basis, the FDA approved Nerlynx on July 17, 2017. If additional studies support this use, it should be discussed with all patients who have triple-negative disease, even if they've been through standard treatment and are reluctant to take another drug, Blackwell said.",

That trial is completed enrollment, collecting data stage. Another bit of info I thought was interesting pertains to how immunologically hot or cold different breast cancer subypes are, and how often they change between primary and metastatic sites. We knew triple negative and HER2-positives can respond to immunotherapy, but here are the numbers explaining why: Among 173 recurrent tumors, specimens were metastatic lesion to liver, lung, bone, skin or soft tissue, lymph nodes, and others in 19%, 27%, 16%, 15%, 14%, and 8%, respectively. In primary tumors, 89% were HR positive and 11% were HER2 positive. ER, PgR and HER2 status changed from positive in primary tumors to negative in recurrent tumors in 8%, 40%, and 6%, and changed from negative to positive in 15%, 15%, and 7%, respectively. Accordingly, breast cancer subtype change between primary and recurrent tumors was seen in 13%. High TILs in primary tumors were seen in 22% of patients and significantly associated with breast cancer subtype; HR+HER2-, HR+HER2+, HR-HER+, and HR-HER- in 16%, 36%, 67%, and 62%, respectively (p< 0.001). On the other hand, high TILs in recurrent tumors were not correlated with breast cancer subtype, but the site of metastasis; high TILs in 6%, 39%, 12%, 8% and 19% of liver, lung, bone, skin or soft tissue, and lymph node metastases, respectively (p = 0.002). In 71% of recurrent tumors, TILs did not change or decreased compared with primary tumors, whereas in 29% TILs increased in recurrent tumors. Among recurrent tumors with increased TILs, most frequent metastatic lesions were lung (40%), and bone metastases were less likely to have tumors with increased TILs (7%). High TILs in recurrent tumors were a positive prognostic marker after recurrence, whereas those in primary tumors were not. Conclusions: TILs as well as hormone and HER2 status altered between primary and metastatic tumors. Immunological tumor microenvironment may depend on the site of recurrence and evaluation of recurrent tumors is required in the immunotherapy era.",

They report on an usual case of a cancer patient for whom CAR-T therapy did not initially work, but then his immune system went crazy and killed all of the tumor two months later- why? and what was the reason for the delayed response? When they investigated, they found that it was just a single clone of one of the millions of engineered CAR-T cells that they had injected, which had grown up and multiplied and did all of the work of killing off the tumor. What was different about that one cell? Well, when they engineer an anti-cancer gene into T cells, it can integrate into any location it wants to, and does so at random, like a virus can integrate itself into any part of one of your chromosomes. In that particular case, the CAR-T anti-cancer gene had inserted itself into the TET2 gene, and inactivated that gene. Humans have two copies of every gene of course (one on each chromosome) but in this patient, he already had a mutation in the other TET2 gene. So he essentially lost all TET2 protein expression, and that was enough for that clone to be able to take off and go to town on the tumor. So now they are investigating whether inhibitors of TET2 or other ways to inactivate TET2, at least trasiently, will make CAR-T work way better, with maybe just a few cells injected, and many more patients respond? Right now is used for blood cancers, but this is a very promising approach we can hope will work for solid tumors too Here is a summary of the paper, published in Nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05251-5  ",

The PI3K inhibitor was the right direction to try, although there just may be no good drugs yet in that space. KPW3- I've seen several stories like the one below, which display a very healthy skepticism of that NKTR-214 Opodivo trial. The gist is that the companies are in a race for market share into the immunotherapy market,as Bristol's Opodivo has been losing out to Keytruda. The trial is designed to show that NKTR-214 boosts the response to Opodivo, but they are not doing the proper control (Opodivo alone) and instead just pointing to their great results in very small numbers of patients as an indication that the combination is better than Opo alone. However, as they add more and more patients, their response rates are dropping- they say its from the known fact that immunotherapy responses take time, the skeptics say it could just as easily, in fact more easily, be that your combo is not powerful, and we won;t ever know this way because you are not doing the right controls... https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/03/asco-bristol-n... I like the Halaven-Keytruda trial in that Halaven seems to be a very effective and tolerable drug, and so its good to see combination therapies being applied. I suppose I would be inclined to take this one, assuming one is sure to get the Keytruda, and then keep an eye on the various drugs in development, including CDK7 inhibitors",

All we have is affinitor, which should work way better than it does. This study says taking the drug in very low sugar conditions makes it work way way better. So that means eating a low sugar diet, or an alternative is to do a longer nightime fasting. Instead of \"take with food\", the label might say \"take while fasted\". Studies in mice show that if there is a long fasting period (for humans it would mean something like \"nothing but water after 6pm\", for example), then the diet during the day can be normal, ie no change to normal is required. Trials in humans show restricted feeding/nightime fasting leads to a drop of about 1.5 points in A1C levels, which is often better than one can get with drugs. And we knew that the PI3K drugs have this problem, because high blood sugar is a side effect and people are sometimes put on metformin. Instead, maybe we can just take the drug at night, after a short 2-3 hours water-only fast, and continue fasting till daytime. Drug efficacy can be wildly different depending on the sugar level. For those keeping count, this is the third news report out this week on possible ways to boost the activity of PI3K inhibitors: 1) Take in low sugar. 2) Combine with an Aurora A kinase inhibitor, or 3) Combine with Neratinib (HER2,3) inhibitor. And of course we want to add in with Faslodex, because once the PI3K/mTOR pathway is inhibited, the cells become dependent on estrogen again. So in the future we already may be taking PI3K inhibitors as part of a 3 way combo- (ie. PI3K inhibitor + Faslodex + AuroraA inhibitor or Neratinib)- if so, adding in control of the diet or fasting could be the only possible way to fit in another treatment!",

Kaption and Sarah, Your listings may not be up to date, but I don't see where either you have had a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor? Its such a common mode of resistance to drugs. There is affinitor, approved in combination with aromasin or fulvestrant (it makes cancer become sensitive to estrogen again, so have to use in combination with an anti-estrogen) and a clinical trial of Alpelisib with Fulvestrant. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02437318 You might also consider a trial with a CDK7 inhibitor (called SY1365) in combination with fulvestrant https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03134638 I believe that trial is set for expansion in the fall. And there are other targeted agents, as mentioned above estradiol is one, so I hope nobody is really running out of options. In addition, it was interesting to hear that the Stanford cancer vaccine will enter trials soon, that one is where they inject right into the tumor a CpG oligo in combination with an OXO40 agent to boost T cell activity, will start clinical trials soon. It starts with a safety test of blood cancer, but then will move to solid cancers. https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-stanfo...  ",

Great point, when the topic is prostate cancer, as my colleagues say, the entire senate probably perks up about the need to move these trials forward, speedy quick!!! I've been wondering why the sponsors are UCSF and Memorial Sloan Kettering, and run by the people who made the discovery. My guess is maybe the results look more promising than anything else the doctors have seen at present that would allow them to make immunotherapy an option for a new subset of their patients, however it might be they had to fund it themselves because the number of patients that would have a mutation in CDK12 is so low that the pharma companies wouldn't bother paying for a trial ? (not enough upside potential financially?) CDK12 mutations are found in just 7% of all metastatic prostate cancers (still that is a large number, prostate cancer kills about 30,000 men in the US per year). There are only nine genes that are implicated to cause ovarian cancer when they get mutated, and CDK12 is one of them. CDK12 is mutated in about 3-4% of metastatic ovarian cancers, which kill about 14,000 women in the US per year. In breast cancer, CDK12 is mutated in about 1.5% of triple-negative breast cancers, and is amplified (over-expressed) along with HER2 in about 70% of metastatic HER2-positive cancers, and high levels of CDK12 correlate with more aggressive cancers. For HR-positive breast cancers, some fraction (do not know the number) mutate CDK12 in order to escape the anti-estrogen drugs- when CDK12 is mutated then the cancer cells use the PI3K/mTOR pathway for growth..

As I'm sure you know, with immunotherapy a small subset of patients show pseudo-progression, where the initial scans on therapy actually can look like the cancer is getting worse but its because the immune system is busting open the mets and making them look bigger, and then on following scans one can see reduction.

Don't worry too much about the SEs, as you know they always list absolutely everything that ever has or could happen, and you may not get any of them. One thing we have learned from the Ibrance trials is it seems like the 125mg dose is too high for many people, so don't hesitate to complain about any major side effects! With these compounds being so much more efficient than Ibrance, you probably will be taking much lower dose of the actual drug, and side effects may be limited to those that are direct due to inhibiting the actual enzyme, rather than colatteral damage. But being one of the first to try the drug, you are in a powerful position to communicate to these folks what is (and is not) an acceptable quality of life!!!",

This would be a targeted therapy, similar to Ibrance (which is a CDK4/6 inhibitor), and clinical trials are expected to start sometime soon through the start-up Syros Pharmaceuticals in Boston. While that may take awhile to get going, existing trials already are trying to combine chemotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (immunotherapy) for TNBC, and there is much anticipation for ongoing early trials at Stanford and from Celgene using anti-CD47 antibodies, with additional trials planned to open late this year or in 2017 that will combine anti-CD47 antibodies with checkpoint inhibitors for many types of cancers. So indeed there is much hope on the horizon,its hard to keep up with all that is happening.",

Because, if not, it was undoubtedly working for the five years you did take it. By ruling out a Femara-Ibrance combo, you might be opting to skip a treatment that could work for potentially a long time, and jump ahead to Faslodex that would otherwise be a secondline treatment. This is definitely not the doctor for you (or anybody!) however don't let that bad experience and the stress of the current situation determine your course of treatment. You are of course desperate to get on something that will get you to stable so you can better assess what to do with the diagnosis, but in the big picture it is important to keep on anti-hormonals for as long as possible. If you were on Femara when your cancer recurred, it is still possible you might respond to the Ibrance-Femara combo (many stil do) but in such a situation it would be important to get genetic testing for the cancer in order to understand what type of mutation caused the cancer to escape Femara. In that scenario, you could either have an estrogen receptor mutation, which would mean you have to move to some Faslodex combo, or if you had a PI3K mutation then you would want to consider the trial of Faslodex and Alpelisib combo. For CDK4,6 inhibitors, the Versenio has diarrhea side effects that Ibrance does not have, you might want to research it before starting, in case Faslodex-Ibrance combo might be easier. I well understand the urge to bang hard on the cancer, but the strategy is to live well and for a long time (and not die) of this disease.

Cancer cells take different amounts of time to grow on different organs because they also have to mutate other genes in order to be able to grow in the environment of bone, or liver, or brain- so the longer we are in treatment, the more mutant the cancer becomes. The focus moves to the cancer type growing in the liver, because that cancer is more dangerous. One question I have is whether, after many treatments and progressions, do you end up with a cancer that is more aggressive and that now would be more responsive to immunotherapy?",

The lessons from Ibrance were try to stick with it, can take more than a couple of months for the body to adjust to the side effects and to show benefit from the drug.

No doubt it is easier if you believe in the power of fasting, but in principle it should improve chemo killing, reduce side effects and damage to your white cells, and help you recover much more quickly.

It must help somewhat to understand the biology of how you are altering your own metabolism to make the chemo as effective as possible. The potential for fasting to alter the response of the body to drugs is huge, huge. I remember reading a paper that said if you give metformin to a fasted (nutrient-depleted) cell, it is 1000x more effective than a cell happily growing in high glucose. That makes sense, its easier to reduce sugar if sugar is low, but 1000x?! Similarly, there was a study that showed that fasting every evening from 6:30pm (water only) till 8am the next morning is good for a 1.5 point reduction in A1C levels for diabetics, which is something they can't even get out of most drugs! The point for that kind of nighttime fast is to get the sugar out of your system, then after an hour or so you are burning fat. So eat any thing you want in the day, but give yourself a long fast to burn it off. The body also really likes regular schedules, so the longer you do this kind of 'fast', the quicker the body adapts to the idea of the fast and responds- your circadian rhythms tighten way up. I have a friend who fasts for fun when he is traveling, he just wants to see how the fast protects him from jet lag etc. Fast a day or so before hand, just nibble on the plane, then eat a big breakfast and have coffee and sit outside in the sunshine on the mornings wherever you have landed, he swears by that.. In your case, you are weakening the cancer cells and waking them up and them out of their sleepy rhythms, right when low-dose chemo is about to hit them, and I'd be you'll get the effectiveness of a much higher dose of chemo, and perhaps much more widespread. We shall see, but I am also very interested to hear whether you think you can bounce back quicker from the effects of the chemo, because your normal cells were more resistant to it. You are protecting your body with the fast, and sensitizing the cancer cells to be killed by the chemo. Afterwards, you can slowly start eating/drinking and clearing out the chemo drug, you may have some nausea anyway, so I'm guessing that part won't be so hard. Good luck tomorrow!!",

These combos, if they work, sound like they would be intended for secondline treatment, when you normally would move from Femara to Faslodex; and in this case they are testing if adding Kisquali would help (well duh, we already know that yes it would, but they need to check with the SERD to be sure) or this PI3K inhibitor, Apelisib. In both cases they ought to know how much of those drugs to test as well, so maybe the phase 1 part is just how much of each is optimal with fewest side effects. Might as well just go straight onto Faslodex-Ibrance. The question is how is Alpelisib looking in ongoing trials? First, you would want to know that you have a PI3K mutation, and could be so because these are common in MBC, Alpelisib is already in phase 3 with Faslodex (SOLAR-1 trial) and far enough along that they are not accepting new patients. The stupid OncLive website won't recognize my email/password (arrgh!) but they have a report from Feb 2018 that at least looks good for efficacy: \"Alpelisib (BYL719) induced a disease control rate of 58.2% and stable disease rate of 52.2% in patients with advanced solid tumors\"...

      "Content": "Oct 11, 2018 12:48AM - edited Oct 11, 2018 12:51AM by Cure-ious Kaption, In case you want to consider more treatments, here is one I liked. They blast the cancer cells with a chemo and add immunotherapy to tee off on those cells and go hunt for others. there are other trials of this kind out there too- just have to do one visit per month for five months... A Phase 1/2 Safety Study of Intratumorally Administered INT230-6 in Adult Subjects With Advanced Refractory Cancers (NCT03058289) To take part in this study, you must have advanced (some stage III) or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer and have at least one tumor that can be felt by your doctor or seen on a scan by your radiologist. You also must have tried all other available treatments. INT230-6 is a combination chemotherapy treatment that is injected directly into the tumor. The first part of this study will determine the best dose of INT230-6. The second part will investigate how tumors respond to the best dose of INT230-6 when it is given with an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. INT230-6 contains the chemotherapy drugs cisplatin (Platinol®) and vinblastine (Velban®) along with a substance that makes them more effective. This study is also recruiting patients with other types of advanced cancers. Here is a More Detailed Description: INT230-6 is comprised of a 3 agents in a fixed ratio - a cell permeation enhancer and two, potent anti-cancer payloads (cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate). The penetration enhancer facilitates dispersion of the two drugs throughout injected tumors and enables increased diffusion into cancer cells. (Nonclinical safety studies showed no findings following drug injection into healthy tissues.) Historically physicians administer the two active drugs comprising INT230-6 by intravenous (IV) infusion to achieve a systemic blood level at the limit of tolerability. The objective is destroy both visible tumors and unseen circulating cancer cells (micro-metastases). Unfortunately, dosing drugs IV delivers only a small amount with a low concentration at the tumor site. This approach especially for late stage cancers is not highly effective and often quite toxic to the patient. Attempts at direct intratumoral injection with chemotherapeutic agents have not shown the ability to treat the injected tumor, non-injected tumors or micro-metastases. This lack of efficacy for local administration is due possibly to poor dispersion and a lack of cell uptake of the agents. Due to the use of the novel cell penetration enhancing agent INT230-6 treatment demonstrates strong efficacy in animals having large tumors. The Sponsor's in vivo, non-clinical data shows that INT230-6 thoroughly saturates and kills injected tumors. In addition, the drug induces an adaptive (T-cell mediated) immune response that attacks not only the injected tumor, but non-injected tumors and unseen micro-metastases. Cured animals become permanently immunized against the type of cancer that INT230-6 eliminates. Clinical trial IT-01 will thus seek to determine the safety and potential efficacy of dosing INT230-6 directly into several different types of cancers. In addition animal studies showed a strong synergy of INT230-6 with immune modulation agents. Thus as part of study IT-01 the Sponsor will seek to understand the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 when administered in combination with immuno-therapeutic agents such as antibodies that target Programmed Cell Death (PD-1 or anti-PD-1) receptors. This study seek to understand whether tumor regression can be achieved and patient outcomes improved.",

In looking over some charts on the number of people who progress after an early breast cancer diagnosis, it doesn't hit a strong plateau at three or five years, it just keeps drifting\" downwards as time goes by- to me, it looked like there might be a plateau out around 50%, and ever since then I have wondered if it really isn't that uncommon to get a metastatic diagnosis. Does the 20% or 30% number they put out there have a time limit (like they are only including the number who progress within five years after early diagnosis?), because if so, it is very misleading. They do meta-analyses and quantation of so many parameters, but it seems that this is one case where they are happy to just use some old statistics? PS Love the mom stories- my mom is not inclined to swear, but you can tell she's losing it when you hear \"Hell's Bells!\" No idea where that phrase came from; never heard it from anyone but her PPS And in case you did not realize, apparently there are bells in Hell",

MRIs are the most sensitive, and many of us presumably would find out we have more mets than we realized it they were more commonly used, but they aren't because it would not change the treatment plans that much, I suppose. I know its scary, but try to view scans as a big benefit to you, telling you what is happening at the cellular level, before the mets get out of control and something awful happens. You may have been walking around blissfully unaware of the mets for quite some time before they were caught, so while the situation requires attention and action, it is not urgent, if that makes sense. with time, -deep breaths!-",

To counteract that problem, the chemists designed a CDK7 inhibitor drug that cannot be recognized by the drug pumping machinery of the cell. So cancer cannot use that approach to overcome the drug. While that's cool, now I wonder if comparable studies have been done to learn how cancer cells become resistant to CDK4,6 inhibitors like Ibrance, Abemaciclib and Ribociclib? Especially since the CDK7 inhibitors are still in early phase 1 trials, whereas the CDK4,6 inhibitors are FDA approved and we are all already taking them! And, if resistance can develop by the same mechanism, maybe there will be future versions of Ibrance-like drugs that are harder for cancer cells to resist, and we can take these modified drugs even after resistance developed...",

      "Content": "Cure-ious wrote: A new video from Irv Weissman (Stanford) has come out that updates the status of the experimental anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy- it is progressing through phase 1 and they are in the planning stages for trials involving breast cancer, in this case starting with HER2-positive patients and combining the anti CD-47 with Herceptin. He shows the drug has remarkable synergy with Herceptin in mice (around the 15-16 minute mark). The approach they are planning to take is also remarkable. First, the metastatic breast cancer cells are removed from the marrow, dropping the tumor burden remarkably. They showed in trials 20 years ago that this step alone CURED about 20% of the patients! To improve on those numbers, in this trial they will restore the immune system and then treat the remaining (now much smaller number) of metastatic cancer cells with Herceptin and anti-CD47. Important to note that although the trial will be HER2-positive patients, this therapy in principle should also work well in the other subtypes of breast cancer, and indeed in most cancers, at least when added in combination with targeted therapies. Keep an eye on this area.. Here is a link to the new video: Dx 10/2003, IDC, Stage IIB, ER+/PR+, HER2- Dx 7/2015, Stage IV, metastasized to bone, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The PR gene gets turned on by ER, so when PR is low or no expression, it means ER activity in the tumor cells is weak. But they still may respond to AIs, although not as strongly estrogen-driven cells. However, the cells are now more sensitive to chemo and to immunotherapy than ER+/PR+ cells. They are also more sensitive to Ibrance! I have ER+/PR-/Her2-, but am responding to Femara/Ibrance. In your situation I would definitely take the chemo, but maybe to to Faslodex/Ibrance after the chemo. Can you get into a trial with Abraxane and immunotherapy? For triple negative BCs, immuno alone was giving only 19% response, but in combination with checkpoint inhibitors like Atezo, that jumps way up to 70-75%! But most of the ongoing trials are only for triple negative, so if you do have Abraxane alone, consider a clinical trial for the next step, such as 1- Here they combine immuno with HDAC inhibitor, in pre-clinical studies, this drug combination worked best (out of 90 drugs they tried) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02395627 2- T-cell adoptive cell therapy, where your best cancer-fighting T cells are engineered to go after your tumor. Amazing stuff, as soon as things really start heading south for me, I'm hoping to try for this one: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clin... Best of luck, we are all with you!!

I hate this cancer, and I hate that we really don't have enough meds to fight it nor good enough ways to determine when to change treatments, and what will work or what won't, in 2018 we really ought to be able to do better.
