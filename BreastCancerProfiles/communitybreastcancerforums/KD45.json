    "Content": "Aug 23, 2012 02:04PM - edited Aug 23, 2012 02:06PM by KD45 I also just yesterday had an excisional  biopsy performed and waiting for pathology report. Had annual mammo 6/9, followed by spot magnification due to cluster of microcalcification in left breast. An attempt was made to do stereotactic biopsy on July 25th but due to clusters being close to chest wall positioning me was to painful and Doctor didn't feel a biopsy could be performed. BIRAD 4 or 5 was noted on mammo report.  I will say a prayer for you and hopefully we both will be informed of B9 results.  I'm new to this forum but do find comfort in reading other members findings and results.  Try to stay positive. I have read that other members who had BIRAD(s) of 4 or 5 still had results of B9 findings.  Good luck to you.",
