    "Content": "SanDiegoGirl wrote: I would really appreciate any knowledge/advise you could give me... My Aunt was diagnosed with Breast Cancer almost 2 years ago (I believe it was stage 3... It had already spread to her lymph nodes). She had the tumor and all the lymph nodes on one side removed and then went through Chemo and radiation. About 5 months ago she began having pain in her chest and elbow... The pain got much worse and spread to her neck and ankle and she developed tumors on her sternum and her neck. It took the doctors a long time but we just got the diagnoses today that she has stage IV bone cancer (or stage IV breast cancer that has mestastasized to the bone... i'm not sure). The doctor basically said that they will do chemo to shrink the tumors but there is little else they can do for her. Is this true or does anyone know of treatments/ other options that may help? She's in constant pain now and it has spread to many places... Realistically how long do you think she can survive? She's only 43! I'm so upset right now... Log in to post a reply",
