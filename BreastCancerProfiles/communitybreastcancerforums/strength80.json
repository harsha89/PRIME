About a month ago I began getting aches in my right breast, and under my armpit. I shrugged it off, maybe I had slept wrong.....maybe my bra was I'll fitting. I was in the shower last week and decided to try a self-exam. My breast have always been extremely sensitive and they are smaller and firm. Well I felt around this sore spot and felt a hard lump....not sure if it was my ribs, muscle or glands. So, I checked the other breast and nothing. I felt it again and finally realized, maybe I should have this checked. I called my Gyno on Tues and they got me in that afternoon. I told her all my symptoms and she did an exam. She told me that it could be fibrocystic changes. I am young and it is sore, so she is not that worried. She told me that she wanted to do an ultrasound, to take a better look. upon checking out the receptionist called to schedule my ultrasound, she told the women on the line she will take the next available apt. I had an appointment the next day (wed). Wed afternoon I show up to have my ultrasound. I lay on the bed and the women asked me to point out the area where the lump was. I showed her....9-10oclock outer quadrant. She said.....it hurt's? I told her it is a soreness. She begins her exam, she asks me to look away, as gel sometimes splatters. So after she begins I turn to see the machine. She has the wand stopped in one spot, and writes info into the screen. I look closer and she is marking this thing that looks like a loufa....she puts four little yellow markers on the screen. My heart kind of sank. She moves the wand a little more and checks a few more spots. About 15-20 min she stops and said ok, I think I am all set. She told me to wipe off and that she needs to record her numbers. She writes down a bunch of stuff on a piece of paper and then get onto her computer and opens images. I see, clear as day this spot that does not look good. She tells me to stay comfy, and she needs to show them to the radiologist. It took forever..........I waited longer than the exam took. She comes back in and said so, the radiologist would like you to have a mammogram. She asked if there was any history of cancer, I said yes. She had me get up and take my clothes to a waiting room down the hall....she gives me a breast cancer bag with a bookmark and tells me to wait here, they will be with me shortly. I sat there and wondered......why are they doing another test?  Another lady comes in and bring me into the mammogram room. I get undressed and had 4 pictures taken of my right breast. She then tells me she has to do the left. She takes two pictures. I was brought back to the waiting room and was told she had to show the radiologist. She comes back in and tells me I am all set, I can get dressed and everything looked good. In front of another patient. So, everything good.....does that mean the pictures were good and he didn't need more or everything is good.....your fine....we didn't see anything? I was told that my doctor would have the results on Friday. Friday is here and I am patiently waiting to hear something....... Has anyone ever needed a mammogram after an ultrasound? When will I hear something..... Not a word was said during either procedure...I see something, or everything is good, its a cyst, its fibrous, nothing.......I am worried sick!  Log in to post a reply",

On my ultrasound it said I have a few ovoid echogenic areas in area of concern with appearance most suggestive of fibroglandular tissue in the axillary. if they noticed ovoid spots how is that fibroglandular tissue????? Mammogram report reads breast tissue is heterogeneously dense which could obscure detection of small masses. Right axillary tail there is accessory breast tissue without evidence of suspicious asymmetry or calcifications. When she did my ultrasound she had marked two spots with yellow markers, indicating some sort of mass, cyst...etc. Where are the measurements, description, or findings? Echogenic area.......means that the echo bounces back....solid right? So if they are ovoid and solid shouldn't that be evaluated??? I am scared stiff.....my grandmother died 3years ago because of breast cancer. She was misdiagnosed, and when they found it she had mastastized throughout her body. I saw her fall apart in one year. My great grandmother, had breast cancer, my mothers aunt. Grandfather had colon cancer and my uncle has it now. All on my mothers side. On my fathers side aunt with breast cancer now. Why are these doctors not getting back to me. They tell me I am too young. That is their answer.....I am scared. ",
