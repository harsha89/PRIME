I hated chemo more than anything so I feel for you that still have treatments. The only wierd thing, I felt \"protected\" with the chemo and now I feel \"naked\"...wierd! The hair thing really bothers me too, as I have to wear a wig for about 9 hrs and it is sooooo uncomfortable. Yuck. I asked Fitchik what supplements she takes, as she is an avid health/fitness trainer. She told me she take Biotin, Milk thisle, VitD,Calcium, B Complex, Mg, CoQ10, Vit c, fish oil, and Glucosamine. She says these have cancer fighting/preventative properties. The Biotin helps with HAIR, so I already have that one! I waited until 2 weeks after last chemo to take supplements. Hope everyone is well! Don't forget to stay away from anyone with potential flu symptoms if you have low WBC's!!!!!!!! I don't want anyone sick!!!!!! Barb",

I had my first TC treatment June 21 for a very small( less than 1cm lump under my arm) which turned out to be ER/PR+ HER- one node out of 11 or 12 positive). I had a lumpectomy and axillary node dissection. I am cuurently just now losing my hair after 5 treatments, so I am very down in the dumps. I thought I would get by with just \"thinning\" but I am looking pretty thin up top. I am 47, and have 2 little children, my son is 7 and my daughter is 4. ( Had to finish grad school first!). I am getting ready for rads as well, and am considering having my ovaries taken out so that I will be postmenopausal so I can use an aromatase inhibitor instead of Tamoxofen, as I have heard it has a 17% benefit to prevent recurrance... Thanks for reading my ramblings. I have been so upbeat for most of this stuff and I continue to work and go to aerobics , but I think the fear and feelings of depression are lurking around! Barb",

I never stopped work and continued to workout in the gym unless my WBCs were too low. I never received Neulasta afterwards and the lowest WBC was 1.2. I never had constipation, just mild diarrhea. The worst treatment was # 5...I just felt terrible. After that treatment I lost about 80% of my hair which I had been able to keep until then!!!!!!

My nurse asked me if I was sick during pregnancy,(yes) and she said I would probably have some nausea with TC. I did, but I have an 8 yr old and a 4 yr old and never stayed in bed until the 5th treatment in which I napped for a few hrs. I hated ever second of chemo but it was doable. I truly believe it is a mental battle as well. I continued to work out and go to work and care for my kids and have a normal life. Don't let this kick you! You can do it!!!!!! Everyone was amazed that I didn't look or act sick. I should have pretended a little for the sympathy I could have gotten from my husband!LOL. Amy, you had some pretty intense surgery, so I KNOW you will get through this with no problem. Don't let it rule your life!!!! Make sure you take the steroids (decadron) the day before treatment and the day after.Take the nausea medication they give you and drink plenty of water post treatment to flush the chemicals from the bladder. Ask your onc for something to help you sleep. Ativan is apparently used for nausea and anxiety, so make him give you that! On treatment 4, I actually did the treatment in the morning and worked in the afternoon... If you can have the treatment on Thursday, your worst day will be Saturday or Sunday(possibly Monday) so maybe your husband can help out.... I wish I could be with each one of you on your first day just to hold your hand. You will be a pro by chemo#2!!! I remember I was so scared for the 1st...I brought pictures of my kids, my dog, brought a DVD player, 5 magazines, only to fall sleep from the nausea medication they give during treatment! The women who seemed to have the worse problems seemed to be the ones that did not get the decadron IV prior to the chemo drug, so ask the RN and doc. I am cheering for all of you and if I can be of assistance, let me know! A friend of mine is just now finished with #2, hasn't had any nausea at all but did lose her hair on day 16. Many do not lose eyelashes and brows with TC but some do.... Barb",
