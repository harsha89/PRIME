Because I have taken so many different chemo, radiation, and hormonal treatments, my only option left was a medical trial. Currently taken TDM 1 under the medical trial Theresa. Too soon to know if is going to work. My prayers with you.",

If the met in your lung is confirmed, I would like to give you hope. I have lived a somewhat normal life for the last 3 years with several mets in both my lungs, plus brain and bone mets. Yes, shortness of breath and bone pain have slowed my down, but I still enjoy quality of life. A prayer for you.",
