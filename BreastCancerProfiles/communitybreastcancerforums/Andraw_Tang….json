No matter what we will not give up, but I want to know how serious she is? the onc told me that she has only 30% chance to live 3~5, is it true?",

I will persuade my brother-in-law, he worries that my sister's spirit will collaps when she gets the truth, it is not good for her treatment if she fell hopeless. I will first let my mom know it, she is with my sister. she will be a strong support for my sister.",

She has a tumor under her arm, now she already has her breast removed, including lymph. while in the checking, it is found that there are 35/51 lymph nodes having cancel cells. and also there is a tumor between her shoulder and neck, her onc told me her cancel is Stage IIIB. I am so sad for the news because she is so young and so healthy. Based on your experience, do you think my sister can survive from this disaster? can she still recover from this? she is now taking Chemo and being taken very good of care in hospital. She is Her2-, ER-/PR+30%. Thank you all. Log in to post a reply",
