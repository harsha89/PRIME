My treatment is at MGH in Boston. Looks like there are a lot of Boston folks here. I'll be doing 12 weeks of THP followed by mastectomy and most likely 8 weeks of AC to follow I'm so glad I found this thread. Really looking for a tribe to go through this with. Looking forward to getting to now everyone and supporting one another.",
