All I can take is Tylenol and the muscle relaxer Flexeril. You have to be given something for pain during the surgery. I also don't do well with a lot of anesthesias, including IV Versed and ketamine. In April I had delayed reconstructive breast surgery (had left mastectomy in Feb 2013) with a DIEP flap. During surgery I was given IV Tylenol (Ofermiv), IV Zofran, Decadron, fentanyl, propofol, and a scopolamine patch behind my ear. I still had dry heaves in the recovery room, but they didn't last long, and I didn't get as sick as I usually do after surgery. They used as little fentanyl during the actual surgery as possible so it'd be pretty much out of my system in recovery. I was allowed to have the IV Tylenol for only 24 hours. After that I had nothing but Tylenol by mouth (1000 mg every 8 hours). I also took Flexeril at night so I could sleep. It helped just a little bit with the pain but would knock me out so that I didn't know I was in pain. I found it really tolerable to use just the Tylenol and Flexeril. Maybe you won't end up needing as much narcotic pain medication as you are anticipating. I am allergic to Phenergan, but hopefully Phenergan and Zofran will work well for you so that you can get adequate pain relief without any nausea and vomiting. Good luck!",
