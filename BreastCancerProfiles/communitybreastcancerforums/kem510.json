(this is very important, as I am 60 and have different need from a 40-something, etc.) Are you completely healed from your surgery/recon?...or still in progress? Describe being numb......I'm trying to understand. 1. Are you describing numbness as no feeling or sensation, as if that area is not attached to your body...completely void of touch? 2. Or - The numbness from nerve damage is a different feeling, one to be more concerned about.. Are you describing a painful, tingling numbness like when your hand goes to sleep and you feel like ants are crawlling all over you? 3. Are you describing the numbness of a recon breast, or the core of your body, like in the ribcage under the breast? Up into the arm? What I learned from having a cervical fusion years ago is that nerves can take up to 2 yrs. to heal after surgery. If you are going through recon, this prolongs the healing until after 2 yrs. of that being done. It would be interesting to know how may STILL have pain/numbness 2 years after being completely done with all surgeries. Mallory - imbalance would be a BIG issue for me. Thanks for pointing it out. Risks - it seems like it is about a 50/50 split on whether to wait to see if more problems develop, or be proactive and reduce risk from the get-go. That is a very personal issue, and I think the stage of life you are at plays a big impact. For example, I am now 60. In 10-15 years, do I want to go through this again at the age 60. Recon - all of you who commented had recon surgery. Just wondering how this all plays into your comments of numbness and pain. Sexuallity - are you saying that the numbness and lack of sensation bothers you during sex? Is this the real issue?",

When someone makes a post and states their opinion, their experiences, etc. That is what that is. This discussion, for me, is a way to take the facts that I learn from research and doctor consultations, and see the implications and reality of VARIOUS choices that I have before me. It is good to hear the rationale behind each one of your decisions. I took Cigi56 to say there are different opinions and experiences to consider, and she was sharing the other side of the pancake. And yes, it is good to see things from a lot of different sides. The sharing of your personal experiences, to me, is an education in reality for you are the ones living with your choices....different choices for different reasons. For me, there are issues any which way I choose. But which issues am I most able to handle, or not? It seem like the philosophy that we have in life comes in to play. Some people want to deal with things as they come, some are proactive and want to nip things in the bud.",

Since my post I have had more consults with my surgeon...again mentioning a BMX. I had a consult witha PS who said he though DIEP was the best option for me! Which I have to travel for. I live in Pensacola Beach, FL. So now I am going to MDA in Houston, my family is in TX, to do retesting and a treatment consult with Dr. Gildy Babiera, a oncologist breast surgeon. Yes.....more professional opinions and testing. Including biopsies. By the time I am done with all this, I think I should have a really good idea of what I am doing and why. I have the Paget's rash which is found in only 1% of all breast cancers and considered rare. With that diagnosis is a 97% correlation with invasive ductal cancer. I am a lucky person! All my diagnostic tests confirm my breasts are clear, that I have the rash only. Among the 1% with pagets, Only 3% have clear breats. How blessed am I. I am in the 3% of the 1%. The best treatment is still MX. If I go with MX, my surgeon #1 said that if no cancer is found during surgery, I probably would bypass chemo. If I do a lumpectomy, I will need to do radiation. So I have the mindset for the MX, but the decision of UMX or BMX will wait until my consultations at MDA. This board has given me a lot of information. I write those things down and take them to the dr. Office. Thanks for caring,",

I am still on the fence, although the radiation doctor at MDA shared with me the radiation Trials that are just finishing. He was quoting me at a 99% survival rate with a lumpectomy with their radiation program based on the nature of my particular cancer. Interestingly, the breast surgeon said my reoccurrence rate was less than 10%, as I was a low risk rate. To me, 10% is not low. She said it was probably a lot lower, but stats are not available in such a rare cancer. I asked her then, why is the survival rate the same in a lumpectomy as a mastectomy. She said because of the imaging techniques we have now. What I am interpreting, the lumpectomy is least invasive, with a small risk of return. It alone is not a cure, but relies on effective radiation and faithful mammograms. The mastectomy, while perhaps more invasive, is very effective since I would receive no radiation or chemotherapy following. Of course, that is if the path reports return supporting all the precvous biopsies. I'm trying here. The lumpectomy may be the smallest incision, but has the most follow-up and the jury is still out to see what happens in the long run. Am I off base in my thinking?",

A week later I was called and told I had Paget's. I didn't even have the pain and itching, just the rashly look on my nipple. I noticed you are from the UK and not sure about how your health care system works. The issue as I see it is that you need to become your own health care advocate. I could have been diagnosed earlier if I had taken care of myself and found a new doctor immediately after moving. Without the skin biopsy, I would have not realized what I had. My mammogram and ultrasound were clear. The scrape biopsy is not as painful as one would think. Just think of the piece of mind this would give you.
