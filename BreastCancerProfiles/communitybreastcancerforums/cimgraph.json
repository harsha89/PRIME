I had the treatments in the breath hold, prone position. Not all patients are eligible for this position.This technique prevents heart and lung involvement. I had some redness and inflammation, tiredness during treatments, but not too bad. I do experience some skin tenderness still occasionally, in fact, just recently. It always passes. I use a numbing cream and wear non restrictive sport bras and clothes when it flares up. You can do this! Carolyn",
