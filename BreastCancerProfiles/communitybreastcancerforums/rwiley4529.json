Even though I live in Colorado (meaning my time and travel would be worth more than $150), I decided to participate. Research is important\u2014even if I am not helped by anything they learn, I have already been helped by the women and men who have gone before me on the breast cancer path. I was raised in the Silicon Valley, so I was eager to make a trip to San Francisco. I made my study appointment for a Friday morning. I flew into SFO on Thursday evening, and rode BART into San Francisco to my hotel. On Friday morning I went to the campus, and then I had the rest of the day Friday and all day Saturday to explore. Two sisters and one brother-in-law were able to join me on Saturday and we had a BLAST. Perhaps that's not workable for many of you. But for any who ARE able to participate, please consider it very seriously. I'll be happy to answer any questions that I can!

That means that I can't wear my wedding ring; either my hand is swollen, or I'm wearing a glove. When it first presented, I didn't think it was LE--I didn't really notice any swelling. What I noticed was a tightening in my forearm and bicep. I was sure it was muscle related, and I mentioned it to my RO on my Wed appt thinking he'd refer me to regular physical therapy. I almost laughed when he mentioned LE right out of the gate; I was sure he was wrong, but I humored him. I saw the LE therapist on Friday, and by then I could see some swelling. On Monday I got fitted for a sleeve, and started wearing it every day. On Sunday night, I was putting some glasses away in the cupboard, and noticed that my arm didn't feel tight or hurt when I did that. And I thought \"hmmm...I guess the RO *did* know what he was talking about. As I understand it, the radiation is to go after any cancer cells that *may* have escaped. In my case, 4 out of the 20 nodes that were removed were cancerous. At my treatment center (and I would guess this is a common practice elsewhere), they have a \"tumor board\". It consists of surgeons, MOs, ROs, pathologists, and I'm not sure who else. So it's not just one person looking at my situation and deciding on a course of treatment, it's a group of people. And there are \"standard protocols\" that they follow.",

I never thought about quitting radiation. My mantra was and continues to be: \"Lymphedema or cancer? I'll take the lymphedema.\" That doesn't mean I like it, just that I will continue to learn to deal/live with it. The LE remained pretty stable from when it started in February until July 4. That is the day I walked a 5k (my first since being treated for breast cancer). My hand swelled up, and I've been dealing with it ever since. The arm has remained pretty stable, but the hand is definitely my problem area.",

One and a half years later, it's hard to find the scar. Obviously, because tissue was removed from my breast, it is now smaller than the non-surgical breast. In my case, it's not real noticeable, so I have not opted for any kind of prosthetic, but they are available if you need/want to go that route. My full treatment plan consisted of lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, and Arimidex. I recently met with a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstruction. The plan is to do some fat transfer from my belly to my left breast. Radiation causes the breast tissue to firm up, so he will also do a lift on the non-surgical side. In the plastic surgeon's words \"your right nipple is heading south\".  It took me awhile to think about reconstruction, and there is no right or wrong decision regarding it... only what is right for YOU. Since your cancer is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, what that means is that those hormones feed the tumor. Your doctor will probably want you to take a medicine that will suppress production of those hormones in your body. There are a few different kinds of meds, with different applications and different side effects. You'll need to discuss all this with your oncologist.",

The fingers don't go numb, but because it is bigger, it doesn't provide enough compression through the main part of my hand; everything was pooling on the back of my hand between my wrist and the base of my fingers. So the therapist suggested putting a foam pad in the glove, on the back of my hand. That provides an even compression, but the seam is causing a problem. :-( I wear LympheDIVA sleeves, and yesterday I ordered one of their new gloves. I'm really hoping that since it's seamless, it won't cause any sores. In the meantime, I'm trying to get the sore healed up.",

HER2- that one I don't remember, either. With the ER+, it means that one form of treatment that you will probably have is some kind of med to stop your body from producing estrogen.
