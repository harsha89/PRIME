I thought feeling awful was the price I had to pay. Well after three more months the cancer was back. After stopping Xeloda I came back to life though. Then we tried A/A...didn't work. Then the doc suggested Abraxane and I thought oh no it's all downhill from here and will have a rotten spring. Surprise......after 5 infusions I still feel normal and have plenty of energy to do all I want. I lost my hair but that's it. Why was I so scared?

My oncologist has only ever mentioned three things about my diet:  cook everything, eat more meat, lose a few pounds. I was worried about the meat so I started googling cancer diets for stage IV and came across the Cornell study.  It eased my mind.  I am also glad that you have found a diet that you can feel good about and that works for you.",

I only have tricare so my VA experience has been through my husband's cancers. First of all I would wonder how much experience they have with breast cancer. I have spent lots of time in three VA oncology clinics in Arkansas and Tennessee and have never seen a female patient. The previous poster is correct with her assessment of the doctors,etc. One clinic didn't even have full time oncologists. They contracted with a civilian clinic and a doctor came by as needed. Nurse practitioners ran the show. They also had no idea that the MMR vaccine is a live virus vaccine. Every time that my husband was hospitalized for neutropenic fever he had a different doctor each day making rounds. He was sent to Nashville for a stem cell transplant for leukemia. The VA transplant clinic there is ran by Vanderbilt doctors and is top of the line. A few years later my husband got lung/esophageal cancer and started out with VA care again. Everything was so slow and disjointed that I was finally able to talk my husband into seeing my oncologist. Unfortunately the leukemia returned after starting treatments for the other cancers. No, I would not recommend the VA for cancer treatment, unless the clinic is connected with doctors from a major hospital like Vanderbilt. My son uses the VA for minor problems and he is not getting any kind of real help. Our neighbor, a civilian doctor, has diagnosed a knee problem that my son wants the VA to fix because it was caused by the military, but they are saying the problem doesn't exist.",

It then calculates how many calories you need to maintain your weight. Then you simply eat less than that. I ended up eating around 850- 900 calories daily and lost a pound per week. The key is to keep track of everything you put into your mouth. Write down the calories for everything. You will be surprised how little you can eat. American portions are majorly out of control. Now I've been maintaining my weight for a year and a half by doing it the same way. Also weigh yourself at the same time every morning ....before or after breakfast. That way you will know if maybe your weight has krept up a pound before you have several pounds to lose again. It sounds tedious but it will become your way of life. It is something I have complete control over unlike the cancer so it makes me feel great when I step onto the scale at the cancer clinic.",
