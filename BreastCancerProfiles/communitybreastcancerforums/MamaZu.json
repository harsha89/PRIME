    "Content": "MamaZu wrote: I'm new to this :( Just diagnosed 3/2 with IDC grade 3. MRI yesterday showed 1.6 cm tumor and no others (thank God). Plan is for double mastectomy with reconstruction. I have a breast surgeon already and have consults with 2 plastic surgeons next week. My worry is, it seems like they won't get me on the calendar for at least 4 maybe 5 weeks. That seems like forever to wait!! I want this damn thing OUT! Will this grow or spread in a month? I did make an appt with another breast surgeon for a second opinion and to see if she can do the mastectomy sooner. But I love my doctor and don't want anyone else to do it. Advice? Thank you.
