My stereotactic biopsy from what I understand now was completely unnecessary. The breast hurts for weeks then stops. Then hurts again. I really hate being operated on but I hear more and more frequently that those markers can be the cause. I'm not surprised as I know I tend to be very sensitive to many things. But I still don't get it. Unfortunately I didnt use a goodbye surgeon for that procedure but my top notch specialist who did my surgery wanted nothing to do with this issue and completely dismissed it",
