I have been expecting my diagnosis for years since both my mom and grandma had cancer (my mom was 42 when diagnosed in 1974) She is my inspiration. She not only beat the breast cancer but she lived to be 78 years old and didn't die of anything related to breast cancer. I agree too, to put this all in God's hands knowing he will take care of me. I am 46 just diagnosed with invasive ductal grade 2 and having a double masectomy on April 2. After chemo, I hope to put this all behind me and get on with life. Deb",
