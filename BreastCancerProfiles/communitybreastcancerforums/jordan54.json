Now I have another lesion on my right lung.  At present time the lesion cannot be removed.  I have some positive sternal lymph nodes.  The OC is suggesting Gemzar injections along with Tykerb or Carbo with Taxtotere.  Now I just have to make up my mind. Like you I had no symptoms.  It sucks having to get treatment but I am very lucky that new therapies are available.",
