I almost did not do the rads. 6 weeks out I have no side effects at all. I did use that silver cream a lot at the end. Maybe my age and health had something to do with it I have no idea. But I hear so many people saying they would rather have a mastectomy than the rads, and that I had a hard time understanding. Also I had breast tissue to work with so that may have been a plus.",

I have to say it was it as bad as expected and I almost didn't do it. The first four weeks went without any issues, and I just started to get red at the end with a small amount of burn, not very painful really. I have lotion to put on it now and it's getting smaller every day. I experienced very little fatigue, and I kept up with my tennis 5 days a week with no problems. I was trying to be careful staying out of the sun with better Tees that covered my chest, but I still had a slight amount of sunburn on the left side. But I have to say, for those trying to decide between rads and a mastectomy, the RADS was not that bad. If you want to conserve the breast, then this is the way to go.
