I'm scheduled for a lumpectomy and SNB on 5/10, and when I'm not obsessing about every little detail of what will happen to me on that day, I'm planning for post-surgery life. Sports bras with a front closure, booking my favorite dog walker, comfy track pants and button front tops on PJs. And of course something fun to wear around all morning and for the wheelchair ride of victory out the front door of the hospital later that day that doesn't go on over my head. One thing I'd love some input on is ice packs. I literally do not have one in the house. So far I'm keen on those coaster size gel packs with cloth backing for stuffing into a bra, and some of the larger oblong shaped gel packs around 11x5. I also like the traditional round screw top bags you stuff with ice. My tumor is on the left side at one o'clock- very close to the surface, and right next to the nipple, which I keep hearing will be handy to hide a scar, although a little tougher with the radiation boost down the road.I;m thinking the pack will rest on the top of my chest, and maybe a smaller one for the lymph area? I've heard a little pillow to keep your arm raised away from your body is a good plan. Does anyone know just how much icing will be involved? A day or two after surgery, or every 20 minutes for two weeks? Not sure if I need to convert the freezer into an ice pack-palooza or not....any suggestions (on anything!) are very welcome! This site has been a godsend to me ever since diagnosis, and I'm just now taking the forums/community out for a spin- appreciate any help!",
