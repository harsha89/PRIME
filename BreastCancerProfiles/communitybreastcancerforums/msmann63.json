Had a bag of steroids, a drip antinausea med, and an anti-nausea injection. Waiting for my Nulasta On Pro to do its thing by 5pm. No issues with the infusion. I'm taking nausea meds every 6 hours faithfully. Have slept nearly continuously since yesterday, but that keeps me off my painful, blistered feet. I've felt like a dishrag today. Will wait and see if I develop any other side effects (mouth sores, digestive issues). Praying that I don't. How are you guys? Bridget",

It's majority lanolin with some petroleum jelly. They are less dry and cracked, but still hurts when walking or standing. Like you, they feel swollen and sunburned. ü§∑üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è Doc says they look better. Still no symptoms on hands and just a sore mouth but no outright canker sores. Continuing to rinsewith baking soda and salt. I slept fairly well despite the steroids, but I'm still so tired. Nulasta will kick in this afternoon. I'm sure I'll be sore from it, as usual. Please let us know your lab results when you get them. I'm so glad you're having another paracentisis on the 30th. Nip it in the bud before it gets too bad. I'm praying hard for good results from labs! We are standing strong together and I'm so blessed the have y'all. As always, I'm praying for strength, will-to-fight, and effectiveness of treatment.

      "Content": "May 17, 2019 08:26PM - edited May 17, 2019 08:26PM by msmann63 Hi Nancy and Cindy: I think we're all in the \u201cfeeling so-so\" category. Other than fatigue, my first treatment wasn't \u201ctoo\" bad; however, Sunday (Mother's Day) afternoon, I was hit with severe diarrhea which lasted around-the-clock until late Wednesday night. No nausea or vomiting. Thought I would have to see doc for fluids, but it finally wore off. The lack of sleep for 3-4 days did not help the exhaustion. I'm having major foot issues (Hand-Foot Syndrome). I can barely walk on them. As soon as I think they are on the mend, then new blisters show up. I'm keeping them moisturized and have tried ice (which INCREASED the pain). This started right after my last Taxotere infusion in March and has not let up. That coupled with the diarrhea had me ready to throw in the towel on Tuesday. I wonder, sometimes, if it's all worth it. I'm sorry to be whining so much. There are so many others so much worse than I am. I see doc on Thursday for monthly visit, labs, and 2nd Doxil infusion. Not sure if he'll schedule scans at that point. My prayers continue for us all. üôèüèªüíï Bridget ",

You had to be miserable...I\u2019m sure that\u2019s putting it mildly. I had the constipation issue after the first infusion. Took about a week to get things in working order (thanks to Miralax). Everything was good until Mother\u2019s Day afternoon. Thankfully, it finally tapered off. I have not tried the lanolin. My daughter is bringing me some tomorrow (she is breastfeeding our newest grandson). I will definitely try it with the plastic wrap. I\u2019m in misery today. Pushed myself to go to my other grandson\u2019s Kindergarten graduation yesterday and I\u2019m paying for it today. I don\u2019t have it on my hands and pray that I don\u2019t! It\u2019s just the feet. Started on the heels only for several weeks, but is now spreading to the rest of the soles of my feet. I have to push myself again tomorrow to attend Jasper\u2019s baby dedication at church tomorrow. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª Thank you for sharing your advice. üòä As always, praying for us all!

My tumor marker jumped to 116, but we are waiting to see what happens after the 2nd (today) and 3rd treatments. I\u2019m doing my best to stay positive and not worry. My feet are still giving me fits, but that\u2019s just part of it. I slept all afternoon and could go back to sleep now, which I may do until the steroids kick in and I\u2019m wide awake.

I'm taking nausea meds every 6 hours faithfully. Have slept nearly continuously since yesterday, but that keeps me off my painful, blistered feet. I've felt like a dishrag today. Will wait and see if I develop any other side effects (mouth sores, digestive issues). Praying that I don't. Hope you are all doing well! Bridge",
