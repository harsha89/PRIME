Thank you for all the tips about mouth rinses - will keep that in my back pocket. AC #1 was a success yesterday. Thanks to my wonderful port I didn't feel a thing. Had to get a Lupron shot to keep my ovaries from producing more estrogen \"fuel\" but it was fine. Didn't really care for the Neulestra at first - the initial \"snap\" was a little jarring! But haven't noticed it since. Spent last night a little foggy from all the meds, but felt good today and went on into work. Opting for normalcy wherever I can get it. I am using so many of your tips ladies. I feel somewhat fortunate to be at the \"end\" of this month board so I can learn from your experience. But also happy for you all that you're farther down the treatment path and even closer to being done with this!",

But she DOES hope to see shrinking like yours and will consider that a very positive outcome. So congrats!! And congrats to Kim on nearing the end of chemo! So sweet of you to bring in a cake! Hope you get a piece and it's the sweetest cake you've ever had. I have 2 weeks of Taxol left. Feeling pretty good. Tiny little bits of hair are growing back! Still a ways to go but will be glad to have the AC+T complete. Regardless of my results from chemo I am certain I want a double mastectomy with reconstruction, so it has been scheduled for December 15.

Guess you never know what you're going to get. I was hoping to get through with my baking soda saltwater rinse, but over the weekend had to call in to request the \"Magic Mouthwash\". It's a fairly vile mixture, but it does work. I am struggling with getting enough fluids every day - the thought of most liquids makes me feel queasy. One thing that does taste good is cranberry juice - I got the Ocean Spray Diet Cranberry and it is delicious. Of course then I feel guilty that I'm drinking a bunch of chemicals and maybe I should drink the regular juice.....but all that sugar can't be good for me either, right? It's better than no fluids I guess? Not sure what the lesser of the evils is. I have to say I quite like my wig - it is very \"breathable\". I can feel the breeze through to my scalp! I don't wear it at home, though - it does start to feel a little tight after several hours. I will also say I was very fortunate that insurance covered the cost for me ($350). I don't think I would have spent that much out of pocket. Stay strong ladies!! Thank you for all your posts/shares/commiserations as we go through this together! Wig pic: <Pic Poof>",

Peachy - we are in a similar boat, I'm also having chemo first. I started with a pretty big tumor but we can tell it has shrunk after 13 weeks of treatment. Even if lumpectomy is an option for me, I'm doing a BMX. My reasoning is that my breasts are REALLY good at growing tumors - over the last 15 years, I've had multiple benign growths in both breasts, and now at the age of 34 I had 3 cancerous tumors grow super quickly. I just feel like it would only be a matter of time before the proverbial shoe dropped in the other breast. This is based on nothing my oncologist has said, just my gut feeling. Go with your gut either way!!! Everyone else is exactly right - it's a totally personal decision.",

I am 34 and was DXed last week with what appears to be two tumors close together in my left breast. I immediately chose a bilateral mastectomy and was assuming surgery would be scheduled first - I was surprised yesterday when meeting with the oncologist that they are advising I go through chemo first to shrink the tumors and \"make surgery easier\". Anyone else along this same route? I am scheduled to get a port late next week and probably start chemo the week of June 25. Also, if Upheld reads this - I see you went to the Lineberger Center. I live very close to Chapel Hill and am considering making an appointment there for a second opinion. Is that where you will be receiving your treatment? Thank you all so much for your information and support, especially during these overwhelming times.",

Usually I can keep a positive attitude but it hit me pretty hard last week. Plus neoadjuvant chemo can screw with your mind sometimes - here I am, 4 months after finding this huge lump in my breast, and it's still in my body! Smaller, to be sure, but still here. And who knows what's in my lymph nodes. I started feeling a little better during yesterday's treatment, though - it was a reminder that slowly but surely I am killing this cancer. It will not win.

My PS said I was a good candidate because I am going to a smaller size (currently DD, going to a full B/small C), and I have enough \"skin thickness\" to stretch around the implant without issue. I am not doing nipple-sparing (plan on tattoos later) and the implants will be under the muscle. My PS said if this was 5 years ago I probably wouldn't have this option but they've come a long way in recent years. He's done a lot of this type of reconstruction and feels very optimistic that it will work well for me.",
