I've noticed there's a big anti-mastectomy movement out there, but for some of us gals it's such a big relief not to have to go every 6 months for the mammo and I found it empowering to be able to make that choice with my surgeon (he highly recommended it). After the reconstruction, nobody could even tell I'd had any breast surgery. Same here with the lack of fat. I had skin sparing bmx with TE's for 6 months to stretch the skin and muscle, and then teardrop gummy bear silicone implants. They did the mx incisions around each areola, which you can't even hardly see now, and the implant incisions underneath each breast. I can see those with a mirror, but nobody else can see them even when I wear a bikini. I hope you have the same good fortune and the same peace of mind. That's priceless.",

The internet is a mixed blessing, with so much info out there at the touch of a keypad. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss, as in my case. I was diagnosed with stage 1 invasive lobular carcinoma at 42 (3 years ago) after my first mammogram. I had never felt a lump, there was no family history, and I didn't have fibrocystic breasts. No bumps, no lumps, no fear. I think it's much worse when you frequently have lumps and don't know how to distinguish when a lump is something to worry about and when it's not. The GOOD news is that you're plugged in with mammography and if you ever do get breast cancer, you'll catch it early. Remember, breast cancer is not a death sentence and we can't let it ruin our lives. I'm a nurse and I was at work in the ICU when the radiologist called me with the diagnosis in 2007. I was in shock for a few seconds, but then I was immediately thankful that my kids were grown and able to fend for themselves, my husband and I had enjoyed a long, happy marriage, and if this was the end of the road for me, so be it. I had a great ride. I hope this helps. You might also read Elizabeth Edwards' book Resilience.",

Also, how do you get a PET scan? Do they ever do one on someone with stage 1 breast cancer? I had a bilateral mastectomy in 2008, but now there's a nodule on my left lower outer breast at the chest wall. The radiologist says to watch it for 6 months and then get an ultrasound. Are they crazy? I'm going to see my oncologist Monday. The MRI report said \"rapid washout\" which is usually associated with malignancy, so why would anyone want to just wait and watch? Ugh! It's so frustrating to hear that \"it's probably benign\" or \"it probably won't ever come back\". If we only considered \"probably\", then I probably wouldn't have gotten breast cancer at 42 when it doesn't run in my family. Sorry. Venting. Does anyone know how I can find out my grade of cancer or my OncotypeDx if they didn't run a  genetic test on my pathology report?

The 1st one was a year ago, but nobody told me about the nodule. The radiologist and my family doc both said everything was fine. Negative. I didn't ask for a copy of the report until a few weeks ago at my chiropractor's request. Thank goodness for her. I went for all the tests last Nov/Dec (bone scan, MRI, plain films) in the first place because of left breast pain....The breast pain has never gone away. For a year and a half, shooting pain through the front side at the nipple straight through to the shoulder blade. Not debilitating. Just there several times a day every day. The docs were thinking scar tissue or mastectomy pain (like the underlying muscle)...With this new MRI showing changes in kinetic activity from a plateau to a \"rapid washout\", I'm not taking any chances. The docs have taught me not to trust them. If you google \"rapid washout\", you learn that it's usually associated with malignancy. I'm not sure why they'd want to wait 6 months to take another look at that instead of doing a biopsy, but I'm not waiting around. I'll get new docs if I have to.",

Sorry you gals are all having to go through this at the holidays, too.  I was diagnosed on Dec. 18, 2007 with ILC after my 1st ever mammogram at age 42.  No lump, no family history. Just an area of dense tissue that showed up on the mammo. My surgeon recommended bilateral mastectomy because the ILC often mirrors in the other breast, and I'm glad I did that because the pathology report showed several different formations of LCIS in both breasts, in addition to the ILC tumor in the right breast. I didn't have the OncotypeDx, but my MIB-1 score was high at 22. I don't know if they do that test in lieu of the oncotype or if my insurance refused to pay for the oncotype.  I was probably too quiet and trusting at the time and I didn't know about this website to learn from other women with breast cancer. Mine was caught early, at stage 1, thank goodness, with a negative sentinel node biopsy, so I only have to do Tamoxifen for 5 years. I had tissue expanders for 6 months, and then silicone implants which all went very smoothly with no infections or complications. The JP drains and the chest heaviness were the toughest parts for me, but it only lasted a couple of weeks. You guys are way ahead of the game by using this site for support. Good luck and Merry Christmas!",

My surgeon told me she'd hear back from the lab Monday or Tuesday. Yours taking 2 weeks would be a nightmare. That's how long it took for me to hear back with the mastectomy pathology report, but I guess the simple biopsy path is much quicker. Good luck to you! I hope it's benign!",
