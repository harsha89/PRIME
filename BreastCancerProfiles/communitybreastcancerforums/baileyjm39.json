I'm on Emend for nausea, get the 1st dose IV before chemo starts and then 1 capsule by mouth on day 2 and 3. On day 2, I also get a Neulasta injection and an IV \"flush\"  which is one of the large bags.The only steroid I get is IV on the day of treatment.I tolerated it  fairly well, with flu like symptoms, heartburn, headache the first few days. I did have side effects  five days later from the Neulasta. I've felt good this week. Will the weekly doses wind up giving you more medication overall? If you try the larger dose and don't like it will she let you switch or is it either/or? I wish you luck in making the decision.",
