I just had round 3 of dose dense AC today and am hoping that, like you found, the Taxol will be easier. Not that I've had terrible SEs with the AC. Had intense heartburn after Round 1, but that cleared up once I started taking Prilosec. Otherwise it's just a bit of nausea, constipation, diarrhea. Feel down and out for 2 or 3 days starting on Day 3, but then gradually better so that I actually feel great for about 4 or 5 days before the next round. Makes it hard mentally to go down the road again, but it's not like we have a choice. LKSHER, I just had mastectomy on left side in January with full axillary dissection (10/25 positive nodes). I guess the pain meds are pretty good because I had very little pain. Had a lot of tingling in the arm and numbness in the armpit, but that is gradually getting better, with the help of physical therapy. They won't touch both armpits unless the sentinel nodes are positive, will they? Here's hoping that won't be necessary. I'm sorry your son is having a difficult time with this. Perhaps once treatment starts it will be easier for both you and your family to cope. I certainly found that finally having a plan in place and starting on it relieved a lot of my anxiety and as a result probably helped those around me too. Will be thinking of you on Tuesday!",

For me, the path report was the biggest blow of the entire process so far. Up until surgery, the suspicion was that I was Stage IIb. However, in addition to finding 10+ nodes out of 25, a second smaller tumor was identified in the same breast, which had not been seen previously in multiple scans (US, MRI, second PET/CT), mammograms, and a second biopsy. I just had my last AC treatment yesterday, with 4 Taxol to go, then rads, then Tamoxifen. I'm just taking it one day at a time, focusing on getting through chemo at the moment. I think the best we can do is enjoy each day to the greatest extent possible and look forward to better days ahead, without fretting too much about numbers or prognosis.

Anyway, since I started chemo, I just haven't been thinking of any of that. Just following the plan, focusing on the moment, and hoping for the best. Why would they not refer you to a PT? I've only seen my RO once for an initial consultation, but she said she likes all her patients who have had axillary dissection to have seen a PT before starting radiation. It was actually my BS who referred me to a lymphedema specialist PT, on the recommendation of the RO. Have seen her twice a week for 4 weeks and it has helped a lot with range of motion and numbness/tingling. Actually, seeing the PT improved my range of motion noticeably after only 2 weeks - do you mean to say they won't even send you to a PT now? Can you self refer or even have your primary physician refer? I'm happy to talk with you via PM if that would help - sure it will all work out for you, but understand your current frustration.",

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2013 05:56PM - edited Mar 8, 2013 09:27PM by caitlin61 Well, reached an agreement with hubby - went to the osteopath, but promised DH there would be no cupping. Explained my concerns re: infection, and osteopath was totally fine with it.  Nihahi, the type of cupping you had is called \"dry\" cupping - I had that all over my back and perhaps wasn't so much of concern, except that it does cause some faily significant bruising (lasted about 5 days).  The thing that sent my DH over the edge was the \"wet\" cupping (two on my front and four on my back), where small perforations are first made to the skin, then a wick is lit inside an overturned glass flask, which creates a vacuum and sucks the skin up inside the glass, drawing blood through the skin perforations (and we're talking a goodly amount of blood).  I have to admit that aseptic technique did not seem stellar.  I agree with my DH and Websister - NOT a good idea during chemo, so I was glad that we can continue with the acupuncture, minus the cupping, while in chemo.  Of course my DH has pronounced the osteopath a \"quack\" for using this technique knowing I'm immunocompromised - but although DH is not thrilled about it, he seems to accept that logical or not, seeing this doctor makes me feel better.  Also, I'm very keen to take an integrative approach to treatment, including borrowing some elements of Eastern medicine.  Interestingly, the osteopath claims that cupping was Hippocrates' favorite method of treatment - don't think my DH gives a damn whether it was or not. Jennie, again, like Nihahi says, I found even a few sessions with the PT helped.  It is important to find somebody experienced in dealing with breast cancer/lymphedema to cope with the cording.  I did experience benefit very quickly - able to assume \"the position\" for instance, even though there is still room for further improvment in my movement in certain directions (strength is good).  The main thing I noticed is that in addition to giving me progressive exercises, the PT repeats passive stretches every session, focusing on moving my arm straight up over my head and out to the side.  Especially in the first few sessions, she guided my arm to places I might have not felt comfortable taking it on my own - heard a few pops, etc - but that made tackling the exercises on my own easier.  She also spends a lot of time on tissue massage around the incision and area likely to be radiated to make sure my skin is moving freely.  I was warned I may have to go back after radiation therapy, but I can tell you it has been extremely beneficial.  In fact, when she measured Wednesday night, my range of motion in the left (affected) arm was better than that in the right!  Even if you could get in 3 or 4 sessions with the right person, I think it would make a difference for you. Felt reasonably well today, but in previous rounds Saturday and Sunday have been the bad days.  Really enjoying Mum's visit. Have a great weekend everybody!",

I'm happy to report that Round 4 is going a lot better than Round 3 for me so far - or for that matter, better than Round 1 or 2.  Not sure what the difference is, other than that my brother has been here since Friday night and he's been plying me with fruit smoothies (on the advice of my sis-in-law, who is a family physician).  Not sure if they're the key, but for whatever reason I feel way better than I have at this point previously.  Also helps psychologically to have reached the half-way point.  My bro has also painted my kitchen (I had started it a long while ago) and is planning to move onto the hallway this afternoon, hoping he'll have time to reach the spare bedroom by the end of the week.  He also made me a nice dinner (salmon, asparagus) while DH was away overnight to check on his house (long story, but DH and I actually have two houses, in different cities/states, and pre-BC were only together a few nights per week - as Edi would say, for me one of the benefits of this s&&t is that I actually get to live with my husband!  I tell everybody that I'm happier now, even with BC, than I was previously because of the fact that DH and I are together full time)  - it is also such a boost to have these visits from my family (nobody scheduled for April, but sisters and cousin are coming in May)! Just heard on Friday that my MIL has suspected renal cancer, and is undergoing further tests today.  Also, DH's teenage niece has a thyroid issue, and cancer has not been ruled out there - she is also seeing a specialist and undergoing further testing this week.  As DH was saying, other than first grandson expected in August, 2013 has not been a year of good news for us so far. Liefie, I thought the day out with your DH sounded like a very relaxing way to spend an afternoon.  I don't have much of a green thumb, but like to try my hand at gardening nonetheless and find visiting nurseries and looking at plants very soothing.  Edi, just loved your photos - so nice you were able to get together with your friend, and sounds like your GD had you hopping with Easter prep - also, very busy week ahead for you!

As Nihahi says, this is a place where you can vent when you need to and ask whatever questions you have. I was diagnosed on Nov 30th, 2012 and lurked in the shadows, just reading, before I felt comfortable joining the discussion in early January. Just do whatever you need to do, at your own pace. I think most of us will tell you that the stage where you are now is in many ways the most difficult. I know I was filled with anxiety, waiting for results, going through what seemed like endless additional testing and a few twists and turns along the way, before finally settling on a treatment plan. Just know that it does get better, once a plan is in place, and you will get through it. I just had my last chemo treatment today and still have a fairly long road ahead of me (radiation, hormone therapy).

Haven't posted lately,since I've been busy with family. Mum left this morning after having been here for 2 weeks. My brother and family have been here since Saturday, so it was a full house. All of us except Mum went to the Indy 500 on Sunday. It was a LONG day for me with a lot of walking, but I made it and had a good time. Saw my radiation oncologist this morning and unexpectedly had my CT scan and simulation. I start treatment next Wednesday. This was a different RO than the one I saw originally, but I liked him. I felt more comfortable that he will take into consideration my concerns associated with secondary conditions. Tomorrow will be 6 months since I was diagnosed - hard to believe! Alive, glad you are doing well so far - hope you will heal quickly! Movie, big day tomorrow - we'll all be anxious to hear how it goes. Dakota, read my Mum your daughter's essay, and she said you must be a very special person to have your daughter admire you so. Edi, pleased that there was good news re: shed man, but sorry you were having a down day. Maria, how is Round 2 treating you? Carla, hope you are doing well and that your appointment with PS went well. Let us know how you find Tamoxifen - I'll be starting in August. Welcome to the new ladies, and love to everybody else. Will try to do a better job of catching up later. Watching hockey with my nephew (Chicago vs Detroit), but can hardly keep eyes open.",

It's wonderful that all of you (Liefie too) have had such successful marriages. DH and I will have been married for 2 years in August (his second, my first) and needless to say it has been eventful - nothing like stressing the system right out of the gate! Websister, congratulations on your new arrival today - how many grandchildren is that now? Traii, I've been trying to remember useful things for post-BMX, as in once you get home (since I didn't have reconstruction, was only in hospital for 23 hours). Here's a rather random list: - button up the front shirts (as recommended by Dakota) and PJs, mastectomy camisole(s) with pockets for drains (they may give you one), safety pins to pin drains, antibacterial gel, or other gel so fingers can slide along drains when clearing, big pillows to help you stay in whatever position feels comfortable (I also used a wedge pillow for awhile), peppermint or ginger drops to suck on if you feel any nausea. Other things people loaned me that were useful:- a recliner, a shower chair (which I actually used for awhile after surgery, believe it or not), a shower head with hand-held attachment (could shower (while sitting in chair) and keep water away from scar easier that way, a tray so that I could eat in bed if necessary for the first few days. DH tended to my drains like a pro - he would operate in a plastic dish pan beside me while I was lying down so there was no spillage. He would put small gauze pads around my drains holes (he cut them in a special way to fit around the drains) and change them each night. Would also check dressing along wound at first and change if necessary. We also had a supply of tape, antiseptic wipes, gauze pads, etc that they gave us when we left surgery center - then we restocked as necessary. I cut up an old pair of panty hose that I used as a necklace to pin drains to while showering. You notice I've mentioned the drains several times - for me it was ALL about the drains and once they were out it was smooth sailing. The thing I remember most is being surprised at how little pain I felt - had a pain pump that lasted for 3 days - but I didn't do reconstruction. Had my minor cervical procedure today but there was nothing to it - DH said only 18 minutes from the time they wheeled me away until the doctor came to speak to him. Nonetheless, I feel pretty tired - almost missed rads appt because we both fell asleep! Feels good to be half way done with rads now.",

Liefie, it must have been so hard to leave your mother - but good that she recognized you and that you had some quality time with her.  Websister, here's hoping that the extra visual and social stimulation provided by your Mum's new location will give her a boost.  I feel so fortunate that my own Mum, after dealing with some cardiac issues last year, has returned to good health.  She has been so supportive to me in trying to help me get my head in the right place to deal with cancer, having been through it with my Dad.  For them, I really believe it brought them closer together than they had been throughout their entire marriage - they became an instant team, and never lost hope. Lesleyanne, what you say is true.  I have already been stunned by how generous and supportive people I barely know have been with their kind words and sincere offers to help in any way they can.  Every such gesture feels like it lightens the burden just a bit. Valo, very sorry that you are having to face this on top of other difficulties - but having observed these ladies over the past month or so, I know you can count on them to help you get through it.  It's important to be able to vent and have caring, supportive and active listeners available at any time - you will find them on this board.",

Carla, I was thinking of you and praying for you today, and truly hope that your first round of chemo went well! Thanks for all the best wishes for my first round of chemo.  I'm still in shock over this, but it appears I will not be joining Carla on the T/C train tomorrow after all.  I met with a breast oncology specialist for a second opinion this afternoon (had to wait over a month to see her), and boy, was it ever a second opinion!  She advised a radically different treatment plan than the one I'm on!  She is recommending mastectomy, SNB, and the oncotype test to determine whether I would even benefit from chemo.  I have two complicating health issues - no pectoral muscles on the affected side (a congenital birth defect), and I was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia (blood/bone marrow disorder resulting in high platelet counts) about 6 years ago - which both factor into this recommendation.  The reason I asked for a referral in the first place is that there is some chance of spontaneous transformation to leukemia over time with my blood disorder, and chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents) as well as radiation come with their own risk of secondary leukemia - so my concern is what impact that might have on me, since I'm already at some risk.  Also, my PET/CT scan showed two positive lymph nodes, but she said the only way to know for sure how many positive nodes I have (if any) is to dissect them - and she thinks I should have the oncotype test if I have <= 3 positive nodes.  So, kind of stunned by all this, but everything she said made sense.  No point in looking back, but if I was going to do surgery first, probably could have done it a week or two ago.  Plus, I now have a port in my chest - but may still end up doing chemo later. Benny, I was very interested in your discussions with the nutritionist.  There seems to be such controversy surrounding soy, but it's pretty difficult for us vegetarians to get enough protein without it - glad to hear this nutritionist thinks it's okay.  BTW, I just bought some \"Sunwarrior Warrior Blend Protein\" on Amazon - it's from all plant, non-soy sources - hemp being one of them.  It cost a bomb - but if soy is actually okay, I can go back to eating and drinking that instead.  Also, I was wracking my brain trying to think of bland soft food suggestions for you.  When I was feeling some nausea after the port surgery yesterday, I ate grits - but not sure you can get them in Calgary?  I did some googling and see you have a Calgary Gluten-free store - think they would have things like corn grits, cream of rice, etc. - pretty bland, and at least a change from potatoes!",

Sherman and Braxton are being good nurses and even better entertainers. MO thinks I might in theory have more pain with Neulasta because of my bone marrow already being \"crowded\" with a lot of platelets. He didn't seem convinced that Claritin helps much, but am going to ask nurse what she thinks today. Any thoughts from those who have taken it? I know Carla has already suggested taking it. Keemo, it's encouraging to hear that you found dose dense ACT doable. Is that what you're doing too Dakota? When were your worst days? My mother, brother, two sisters and a cousin have all volunteered to come down from Canada and back up my DH to help me get through chemo in March, April and May. Just trying to figure out when is the best time for them to come relative to infusion. Guess I'll know better once I get through this round. Edi, I hate to think of your GD being bullied.

The only thing I would recommend considering, if you haven't done so already, is to seek a second opinion from an NCI cancer center - I believe Emory is the closest one to you? On the basis of two tumors in the same breast and 10/25 positive lymph nodes, my MO proposed 6 x TC. However, the specialist I saw at Indiana U and her colleagues recommended dose dense AC/T (same as Dakota, I think). Was torn about it, but went with the AC/T - it wasn't fun, but I got through it. As my MO advised, whichever you choose, don't look back and second guess. I had a port, but it didn't cause me any issues (although stopped working for blood draws for the last few cycles). I know Carla was originally on 4 x TC, but opted to increase to 6 cycles, because of the TN potential. Sorry to hear about the employment issues some of you have had. My employer was very generous, my boss was understanding and accommodating, and my work-mates responded like you might expect a church family to do. I was off for about 5 weeks after the BMX, then worked from home for about 2.5 months. I was completely off for 2 or 3 days every chemo cycle. My husband was also granted a substantial amount of leave (most of it paid, some of it unpaid). As far as going back to work, I really wanted to avoid being exposed to germs while I was going through chemo (Feb through May), which is partly why I worked from home. One advantage of going back on site at about the time I finished up chemo is that it helped me feel productive and socially connected - but did leave me tired. Liefie, hope you are on your way to an absolutely wonderful time in SA!",

I took quite a sabbatical myself during my post-treatment funk. Sending you very best wishes for smooth sailing through chemo! Sounds like the surgery went well, Movie. If you have to spend time in a compression suit, I suppose that it's better it be in Winter rather than Summer. Hope your recovery goes smoothly. So nice to hear from the Land Down Under, Traii!! Hope that the lymphatic massage will be successful in alleviating the swelling you're experiencing. Lovely photos, Edi - like Adagio, I particularly like the one of the view over your back fence - looks so peaceful! Well, we're supposed to experience some wintry weather over the next couple of days - but it will pale in comparison to what you've had so far in Calgary. Still no sign of those dang keys - DH is not impressed ...",

Glad to hear an update from Benny, Nihahi - hopefully she will check in herself soon. Morwenna, good luck with your run of appointments - it works a bit like that for me too.  Seeing my MO next week, but in about 3 months time I'll be seeing my MO, RO and BS for follow-up. Edi, that's great your DH is on a health kick!  My DH has also said he will join me in a weight loss effort - although he doesn't have to lose nearly as much as me - easier to stay on track when you're both on the same page! Websister, I can understand why you'd concerned about being put on the every 12 month follow up plan.  Also not good that you feel you were given the brush off re: your concerns.  I see my MO every 3 months, and expect that will continue for another year, at least.  Of course, was seeing him every 6 months anyway, before BC, because of my blood disorder. Currently, seeing both RO and BS every 6 months - they can both feel a \"shelf\" in my remaining breast, although nothing showed up on either mammogram or ultrasound - but they want to keep an eye on it (asked my BS if I could follow up with him every 6 months rather than every 12, since of my medical providers, I figure he is the most experienced in clinical exams).  Can you request closer follow up, Websister? I know some of you have expressed that you need to step away from breast cancer and BC.org for awhile, but I feel I'm not there yet.  I certainly took a break after finishing treatment, but ever since Carla's passing, BC has been pretty much front and center for me.  It doesn't help that I'm still having on/off pain in my left buttock/thigh.  Anyway, I'm putting your advice into action, Nihahi, and making sure I have things to look forward to in the not too distant future.  Visiting my Mum and sisters in Ottawa in February, then back to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and hiking in Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland in early July with my brother and family.  Also trying to up my fitness level and have set a goal of losing 1 pound per week. Love to you all!",

Traii, surely your heat wave can't continue much longer - sending you cooling thoughts!  Let me tell you, it's plenty cool here today and about to get colder. Today is the anniversary of my mastectomy.  In some ways. It seems like a long time ago.  Saw my MO for 3 month follow-up today, and have to say I felt a bit like I was being the short shrift too, Websister.  I had a list of questions prepared and we walked through them.  Re: my buttock. hip, thigh pain, he said it's highly unlikely to be cancer and I shouldn't even be thinking about cancer at this point, but focusing on living my life - now there's a challenge!  It's true that I am hypersensitive about the pain/discomfort I'm having - constantly checking mentally to see if I can feel it.  He did say we may have to do an MRI \"at some point\" - I had an x-Ray that was clear in November.  At least I have the benefit of following up with the whole gang (MO again, RO and BS) in  another 3 to 4 months, since all three have somewhat different styles/approaches. Also asked him about Zometa, since I read on some of the other threads about it being used preventatively for people with Stage III.  He said this has not yet become standard of care but may well in the near future, at which point he would consider it an option to prescribe it. The big news is that my DH officially retired on Monday - hopefully that means we'll soon be living full time under the same roof. Have to somehow manage to head back out in the cold to go curling in a couple of hours.  At least DH is cooking, so I can have a bit of down time.  It's been a very hectic week at work. Happy weekend!",

In fact, felt well enough to venture to a Mexican restaurant with my bro tonight, one of my few non-medical related outings in the last 7 weeks. Bro heads back to Halifax tomorrow - I will miss him, but he will be back in town for work in May. Edi, we were watching Johnny Cash documentary the other night and all I could think of was \"ring of fire\"! Johnny has been visiting me on and off over the past few days. BTW, I thought your GD looked a lot like you in her photo, especially around the eyes. I envy you girls in the Commonwealth, with all your Easter prep and a long weekend looming. Find it very hard to get past the fact that Good Friday isn't even a holiday here (and forget about Easter Monday). Nihahi, sorry to hear of your DD's troubles. Perhaps it will turn out to be a blessing for both of you that she will be with you as you prepare for your surgery - sending the best possible thoughts your way. BTW, that was another breath-taking photo - a perfect birthday gift for Benny! Websister, was so sad to read that your poor Mum has suffered another fall. Wishing the very best for you both. Movie, I hope that you feel better soon. Was confirmed today that my MIL does in fact have renal cell carcinoma. Feel very badly for her. She's a lovely 85 year old lady who looks and seems much younger than her years. There's a family wedding (DH's niece) coming up in April, and although I don't feel up to it, trying to convince DH that he should attend and visit with his mama for a few days. That's all for now. Benny, hope you plan to come back to us soon - wishing you a very Happy Birthday in advance! I'm like Movie - it was Benny's original post, and following her story, that drew me to this thread over any other.",

Was great to feel welcomed and somewhat \"normal\" for a few days. Felt a bit shakey on the first day, but improved every day. Carla, hope you're doing well and that the fuzzy tongue is in the rear view mirror. DH and I did some planting last weekend. I was kind of useless (weak), but we got everything in the garden that can be planted before it gets warmer. Was wonderful just being outside for that long. My sisters have been here and we're having a blast! I took yesterday off and we did a major shop, hitting garden centers and sales. I actually held up surprisingy well. My younger sister has been working on my flower gardens and they're both focused on making my house a bit homier - it's looking great! Had a few friends over for dinner last night. Weather was perfect, so we sat outside. Nice to have a bit of levity before embarking on Round 7. Hope everybody else is doing well.

This is the time in the chemo cycle when I actually feel pretty good - and Thursday is the last one! Had to get up early to take DH to airport by 6 AM so he could fly his plane to KY, whee he was then going to fly his mechanic's plane to Myrtle Beach, so they could inspect yet another plane. After dropping him off I worked all day, then went to a BBQ at some friends' house this evening (even had a glass or two of wine - naughty!), got home around 9 PM, paid some bills, yet I'm not overly tired. My Mum is coming back tomorrow and staying for two weeks. Apparently my sisters reported that the situation between DH and me is very tense and that they thought it would help if Mum was here. Think DH is chafing at being here all the time, whereas my biggest fear is that we're going to lapse back into our old pattern of living in separate states and spending less than half our time together. Edi, I think he does dip into \"The Breast Cancer Husband\" from time to time, but not sure he's read it from cover to cover yet. Okay, not to make a liar of myself, but now I am feeling sleepy.

BTW, think the adult beverages will have to wait awhile (I'm planning champagne in about 2 weeks - my brother's 50th, Mum's 82nd birthday, and post-chemo celebration for me - and we'll all be together!) - but you girls are welcome to hoist a glass if you feel like it! Generally, still debating whether I feel comfortable drinking when I'm done treatment - thinking that an occasional glass of wine will have to be it. Movie, wow, so glad you weren't seriously hurt by that face-plant (trust me, I can relate - plenty of embarrassing falls in my time!) - and amazing that you instinctively protected the \"girls\"! Love the photo of you and your DDs Edi! Also, that's very promising news re: the shed man. Liefie, hope that your preparation for surgery is going well and that you and DH will have good week together leading up to it. My DH and I have had our moments too - so much stress for him (my BC, his mother's cancer, job situation) - and it does seem like men don't know what to do with their genuime concern for us, meaning it can come out in inappropriate ways. I too would consider DIEP down the road (maybe in a year or so), if I'm a candidate. I'll be starting rads in June (33 treatments), so hopefully that won't totally wreck my skin and render reconstruction impossible. Traii, hope you get your results (and a date) soon. Websister, praying that your pain is under control and that your scans go well tomorrow. Maria, hope you are still doing well! I'm impressed by your level of activity. AC pretty much flattened me during days 3 and 4 after treatment and recovery was slow after from then until the next round. My stomach continues to give me quite a bit of grief, even with Prilosec and sometimes Zantac too. I'm worried it could be an ulcer but MO just said my symptoms are to be expected (mainly hunger pangs when I'm not hungry). Hope everybody else is having a good week so far - night all!",

I'd like to think that will translate into a rare good sleep tonight. Was a bit of a mix up re: radiation, whereby the RO I had seen back in February no longer works at the center where I'n being treated - so the simplest thing seemed to be to switch to one who does work there. That may not be settled yet - need somebody who will pay complete attention to my case, including missing pectoral muscle and potentially altered chest wall anatomy, given that I had my left breast removed - close to heart.

Supposed to start rads today.  Was told it would be a longer session with discussion of treatment plan, more checking (I think they said X-rays) and then first treatment, before shifting to my regular schedule tomorrow.  Hoping I can be scheduled early morning or late afternoon, so that I can go on my way to or from work.  Still feeling pretty apprehensive about it because of left side issues - but RO assured me that they wouldn't do chest wall unless benefit outweighs risk. My sister is having a mammogram/US today because of a breast lump that she says has become enormous in the past week or so.  Hoping and praying it is nothing serious (she has a history of benign cysts). Nihahi, sorry to hear about the issue with your face. Hope you are able to get that taken care of quickly, and that the description of the excision sounds worse than it actually is.  Oh, and going back a bit in the posts, I'm with you on the S-word - give me bears any day!  I'm okay with worms though - in fact, if I see one caught on the side walk after a rain storm, I usually stop to move him to some grass or soil. Edi, really hope you're doing okay!  Miss seeing your posts and hope you will be back here shortly. Movie, can't believe your trip to Japan has come and gone.  Hope you'll share more about it when you're over jet lag. That's great news Alive! Hope you are recovering well.

Benny, I can't believe how long you have to wait to see somebody at the LE clinic, even though you're in pain!  My sis-in-law (a physician in NS) keeps telling me how long wait times can be in Canada.  My sister (Ottawa) still hasn't heard about an appt for here mammo/US, despite seeing her doctor last week re: a sizable lump in her breast (suspected cyst - but still).  I miss Canada in many ways, but I guess timely access to care is one aspect that seems to be better in the US (well, at least if you have insurance). Websister, I enjoyed seeing photos of your son's graduation and the party for your MIL on FB.  Looks like a good time was had by all at both events!  My MIL (85) has opted to go ahead with surgery for her renal cell carcinoma (Stage 4).  It's a difficult call to make, since as you say, QOL is an important consideration, but she has been deemed a candidate for surgery (laparocopic planned) so decided to do it.  I hope and pray she will come through it without complications.  When I talk to her I get the impression that she thinks that if she does surgery, she won't need to do \"chemo\" - but I'm almost sure she would have to go through a targeted therapy regimen at some point - they're just trying to spare her the SEs of that until absolutely necessary.  Anyway, DH will go down there again around the time of her surgery (end of this month). Nihahi, sounds like you're quite frustrated with the situation with your DD.  Hope she was able to get sufficiently organized to do some pruning of her boxes so that the move won't be such a burden for you and DH. Alive, sounds like you are doing well.  Hope you have a bit of a break before chemo and that it will go smoothly once it starts. How is chemo going for you Maria?  Hope you continue to have only minimal SEs. Well, time to either cook some dinner, or convince DH to do so.  I hear we're supposed to have some major storms later tonight.  Have a good evening (or day) everyone!",

It does seem like that rudderless feeling hits almost everybody once active treatment is finished. I hope that you will get through these rough waters soon. I'm finally getting a bit of stamina back - at least enough to do short stints in the garden without feeling like I'm going to keel over. DH and I are enjoying eating fresh veggies from our own garden - helps that he's here most of the time to help me tend to it this year, rather than in another state. Trying to stick to healthy eating now that I'm getting beyond the worst effects of chemo. Hope everybody has a great week!",

Nihahi, sorry to hear you're still having to ice. I agree with the others, Movie - 26,000 steps is very impressive! Think I may follow your lead and start wearing my pedometer - but it's always depressing to discover how little I actually move through the day with my desk job. Concerned about my MIL today. She had her nephrectomy yesterday, and they had to do open surgery in order to remove the kidney. She will probably be in hospital for about a week and it will take considerable time to recover. Not sure what's up with DH - have urged him to go down there - at least 3 of his sibs are already there so MIL is not alone. Sounds like he has decided he will, but not sure when. The disadvantage (from my viewpoint) of owning a small plane is that he NEVER makes advanced plans - it drives me crazy! Stomach was bothering me again yesterday. Think it's getting better over time, but I still get a burning/knawing effect on some days. Think it's a lingering SE of chemo. Still taking Prilosec daily and sometimes Zantac and have mentioned my symptoms to both RO and MO. Fear it could be an ulcer - think I will start documenting how often it flares up. Looks like it should be a nice weekend here with pleasant temperatures - mid-70's. Looking forward to puttering in the garden. Hope you all have a wonderful weekend, wherever you are.",

I was prescribed 21 Xanax last November and used them as needed over the course of 6 months of treatment. Considered it just one more item in the toolbox for dealing with the roller coaster ride that is breast cancer - we do what we need to do, and there's no shame in taking advantage of any and all means of support and relief available.

Morwenna and Edi, I can relate to you both on the fears, aches and pains front. I liked Nihahi's advice to focus on shorter term, less big event goals. That's my problem - I'm a planner and I like to have short, medium and long-term goals, but right now it feels like it would be foolhardy to look more than a few months out - at least every time I find myself thinking on the scale of years out, this little voice inside my head yanks me back saying \"Remember, you have cancer - it's just a coin toss as to whether you'll even be alive\". It's all because of those damn nodes - think I might have been able to be more optimistic with a different pathology. Anyway, guess this is another life lesson - that I should use a candle rather than a lantern to light my path and take each day as it comes. Morwenna, I went out and watched your video on YouTube too - beautiful singing and it just looked like you were all having so much fun! Edi, did you say your first concert is this week? Did your DH relent and decide to go with you? In any case, hope you will have a joyful time! Nihahi, glad to hear your GWA went well - miss you on the boards when you're not here! I too am hoping that Benny is doing okay and will soon be back with us. Movie, in your pockets tomorrow - hope it will be a pain free event for you. Momof2, hope your SEs are diminishing and that you'll have some very good days before the next round.

BTW, I never realized a scouse was a stew - but you're right, what I made was essentially a scouse plus red wine! Good thread, Morwenna, re: life after treatment - oh, and beautiful tree too! Like you and others have expressed, every pain and twinge causes me to panic - the discomfort in my buttock that comes and goes (my major worry), a recent stitch in my side that lasted about a week, last week nausea while at the gym, feeling more out of puff than usual while walking, sudden bruising on my foot and legs - and on it goes - seems there's something new every week! I work myself up into a compulsive frenzy with consulting Dr. Google and reading threads on here - but then get to the point where I just have to let it go because it wears me out. My Mum is always very good re: helping me adjust my attitude. Also trying to follow advice from Nihahi and those on other threads to, along the lines of what you were saying, find some things to look forward to in the near term, like making plans to do things with DH I know we'll enjoy, establish some goals re: diet, exercise, well being, and keep the anxiety re: what the future might hold in check. Websister, I hope your stamina builds and that you continue to make progress re: your work schedule. My fatigue seems to operate at a larger scale - more like good weeks and bad weeks. In early November, I actually felt at least as good as I did a year ago, prior to diagnosis. Last week, all I wanted to do when I got home from work was crawl into bed, and wondered how I was possibly going to last until Friday evening. Well ladies, I hope this week is a good one for all of us. Time for some sleep, if I can manage to cool off from this Tamoxifen-induced internal heat wave!",

Like several of you, I'm worried about additional risks of left side radiation (I had unilateral MX on that side). I have the additional complication of having been born without a pectoral muscle and may have some abnormality in my chest wall too. Just started doing some more in depth reading today and sounds like I should be a candidate for some of these methods you've mentioned (bolus, breath holding) too. There just doesn't seem to be much separating my skin along the incision from the chest cavity, with the lack of pectoral muscle. Hope whoever I end up with as an RO is willing to customize a plan for me. I actually wonder how much benefit I'll get from irradiation of the incision/chest wall, since I had good margins - lymph node area is another story and I know I need radiation there.",

Anyway, he said to me \"we'll get through this together\", which were words I needed to hear. Don't know if it helps or not, but I come away from his office feeling as if I might live - whereas have to admit I come away from some of my other treatments feeling as if I might die (well, maybe that's too strong - but certainly I come away with an element of fear in my heart that's hard to shake).

Your GD reminds me of my niece, who also rides. Benny, so pleased to see your posts! I have to say I share your fears looking forward, but I took comfort in the wise words Liefie, Nihahi and others shared with you. I'm a statistician by training and profession, which makes it especially hard to forget about the numbers and just get on with living life to the fullest, focusing on the present, without fretting so much about the future - but I think that's what we all have to do. Also, the dietician I saw gave me a paper describing a study that found that dietary changes and exercise can have a protective effect equal to that of chemo, at least for some women. I'll post the reference here later. I'm feeling better, getting ready for Round 3 of AC on Thursday. The best news is that my Mum is arriving from Ottawa on Tuesday and staying for 2 weeks. It will be such a lift to have her here. Hope you all enjoy the rest of your weekend and have a wonderful week ahead!",

Glad Benny's bum is better Benny - remember trying to deal with my bro's Persian who had similar problems when we were growing up - no fun! Websister - very good news on the MRI date!  Still kind of amazed how long those appointments can take.  Like you say, perhaps this bodes well for Traii getting a surgery date too. Nihahi, by low stamina I mean that I can't seem to do anything that is physically demanding.  Okay being at work, since I sit on my a$$ all day - can be mentally taxing, but not physically.  Also did surprisingly well with walking. However, when I try to do something simple like weed the garden, feel like I'm going to pass out after 5 minutes.  Even changing the bedding seems to get me in a sweat.  Think it is probably low hemoglobin/RBCs, since my counts were low by the end of chemo.  I know Liefie has mentioned several times that it can take months to get back to normal - guess I'm getting a bit impatient.  The other thing that is getting old is being bald.  Especially now that the weather is warmer, can't wait to rip the wig off when I get back from rads each day - at least I can see a few hairs now, but regrowth is very, very slow. Don't blame you for cheering for Boston, Dakota!  Great that your DS is so excited.  I grew up in Eastern Canada, so the Boston sports teams were popular with a lot of the people there, being relatively close.  However, I was always a died in the wool Toronto fan. Time to see what's for dinner.  This week I planned ahead, by putting together a menu on the weekend and doing a major grocery shop so I wouldn't have to think too hard during the week.",

I had a day of running around like a chicken with my head cut off at work and really should have worked this evening in an attempt to catch up- but just didn't have the strength to do it. Tomorrow promises to bring more of the same. I hope our thread isn't dying. In my case, I read practically every day but haven't had much physical or mental energy for posting. Suppose I'm in a post-active-treatment slump. Finished radiation almost 5 weeks ago, then had a couple of weeks of total exhaustion, where all I could do was crawl into bed when I got home from work. Started Tamoxifen almost 2 weeks ago and suddenly felt better up until the beginning of this week - but now I'm very tired again. Saw both RO and MO in the past week. RO did clinical breast exam and found something in my remaining breast that I have to watch (of course, I'm not even sure I can feel it). MO now says I have to go back on Anagrelide (medication to reduce my platelet counts) plus a full aspirin per day to combat the clotting potential of Tamoxifen, but that concerns me because my stomach still feels a bit ripped up from chemo. Also had a pain in my tailbone that lasted over two weeks - then disppeared - but now seems to have flared up - MO was not the least bit concerned (I have to say I am - just wish it would go away). Didn't intend this to be one long tale of woe - but it sure sounds like one! Seriously, I felt so much better last week that it gave me a boost - hoping to get back to that.

Benny and Jenifer, I have been on antidepressants a couple of times, and they helped, at least initially. RO says he may recommend that I go on Effexor if side effects of Tamoxifen don't subside (night sweats and sleep disruption). Websister, sorry to hear you are facing some difficult choices as a result of the genetic counseling. My experience of breast cancer so far is that there is never a dull moment - always something new on the horizon to consider. My sister, in Canada, went through a genetic evaluation recently. Apparently she was assessed as having a 20% chance of developing breast cancer - but that is not considered sufficiently high to receive annual MRIs (she has recurrent cysts and was hoping to be eligible for screening beyond mammograms). Was in training this week, which was somewhat of a distraction, but otherwise Carla's passing has been weighing heavily on my heart and mind.",

Things finally got so bad between my DH and me that we are BOTH going to counseling, and I think it's helping. My health is not the only stressor in our lives - he's in a terrible employment situation (think he may actually retire in January) and his mother also has cancer. One of the positives re: counseling is that I've realized he doesn't talk to anybody, except me, about any of these issues - and now he has a chance to work through them with a man roughly his own age. Do you think your DH might consider going through some counseling with you? Of course, mine only went initially under the guise of it being about MY issues, but now he's committed to it. I waited a long time to find the man for me (almost 50 when we were married just over 2 years ago), so I hope we can get back on track. I'd rather live 50 Shades of Grey than read about it!

Like Morwenna says, my RO recommended adding in something with anti-itch properties to the blistered area, in addition to the usual (Aquafor, aloe Vera, and I also used over the counter Biafine) - that seemed to help get me through the last stretch.

Well it was a long week that wrapped up with me being laid up in bed with a respiratory infection of some nature - that's where I am still, although almost seems appropriate for a snowy afternoon. The best news is that the week also ended with my DH sunmitting his retirement notice - something I've been wishing for, for many years. Hopefully that means we'll be living under the same roof - soon! Traii, love your avatar - unbelievably cute photo of your DS on FB. Your hair is looking great, girl! Edi, your big concert, i.e. the one your DH didn't want to attend, is coming up soon, isn't it? Hope you have a lovely time. Websister, I'm sure you and Paisley had fun together! Well, still have a lot to clear off my plate at work this week, meaning I hope I can shake off whatever this is by Monday. We're heading to Nova Scotia next Saturday, back to Indy on the 27th, then Louisville on the 28th and Mississippi on the 29th - so lots of travel coming up. Hope you all have a cozy weekend - except those of you in the Southern Hemisphere - wishing you easy, breezy days!",

Kellya, like you, my Dad battled cancer (he passed away 13 years ago today) and I must say it helped me greatly to be reminded of his courage while I was going through treatment.  I had 8 rounds of chemo and 30 rads, finishing last July.  For about 6 months, I felt pretty weak and wiped out - at first, I couldn't do anything physical for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I was going to pass out.  However, I started exercising in January, and now I feel great - better and stronger than I did before diagnosis.  A friend and I are training for a half marathon in November and planning to run some 5Ks between now and then. I'm scheduled for an MRI on my supposedly good breast on Monday.  Not too worried about it, but my breast surgeon wants to be sure that the \"shelf\" both he and my RO can feel, and have been able to feel since last August, is not a problem. I may PM some of you who have been through DIEP or who are gearing up for it.  I've been referred to a surgeon here and will probably meet with him in July.  Not sure it's what I want to do yet - if I do have surgery, it probably won't be until another 8 months from now. Beautiful photos, Edi, Dakota and Movie!  So sorry to hear about your Mom, Movie, but hope hospice will take some of the burden off you. Hope everybody is doing well!",

Always okay when I wake up, then late morning start getting this gnawing/burning sensation about where my esophagus meets my stomach that gets worse through the day. It started during the latter stages of chemo (finished 7 weeks ago) but was definitely worse this past week. Yesterday, RO said radiation to the left side can sometimes cause stomach issues, which was news to me. Anyway, think mine is probably lingering effects of chemo. Hope yours clears up soon!

For me, it must be the steroids, but hope I can fall back to sleep soon. Re: the osteopath, well I'm supposed to see him this AM, but there was a heated discussion on the matter last evening. My DH and I have been together for 8 years, but only married for a year and a half (my first, his second). Have to give him credit, in that he has come with me to every single med appointment/consultation and every single treatment, except the first time with the osteopath (friend who recommended him took me). Anyway, problem is that DH came with me last time - to the treatment - and osteopath did acupuncture but also ventured into the land of cupping. DH was appalled and almost put a stop to proceedings - he doesn't want me to go back. He asked MO about it yesterday - MO said acupuncture is okay (I didn't mention the cupping), but isn't convinced it would help much with chemo-induced nausea because of the number done on the GI tract. I would like to continue acupuncture but also don't think I should do cupping during chemo, especially version that involves breaking skin. So, sent DH NCI summary on scientific studies of potential benefits of acupuncture for cancer patients, but remains to be seen whether I cancel appointment. Honestly, I go because it makes me feel better mentally and spiritually. On the other hand, I realize it's my choice, but feel I have to give DH's opinion considerable weight now that we're married. Phew, sorry for the long rant. Just another treatment decision to negotiate, I guess. Edi, sounds like you had a lovely time with your GD. So nice that you were able to keep each other company! Like Nihahi, hope those wrinkly butts will soon be on their way, and you can have a long hot bubbly soak, in peace! Scottiee, glad that all is well with your son and hope he gets the monitor soon. Liefie, Turks and Caicos sounds like an excellent getaway spot for a winter warm-up. Tell that DH of yours to sleep in, and then enjoy the sun and surf to the max! Thanks for the compliments on the wig. General consensus is that I should keep it, even when/if my hair grows back. One friend even told me she prefers the newsboy cap I've been wearing around the house (when not going freestyle) to my own hair - hmm. Okay, time for some water, then shut eye.",

From a distance, it sounds like you're doing everything right in terms of living a healthy balanced lifestyle - and we all need a little chocolate from time to time. I don't know about you, but I too have been told by my DH that I have no self-discipline, and I did NOT appreciate it! I've actually lost a bit of weight, which I chalk up to no alcohol and diminished appetite - but it's just a drop in the bucket compared to what I need to lose. I was stunned when my MO told me he has seen some people gain 40 or 50 lbs while on chemo. First Taxol went okay - no allergic reaction, but just now starting to feel some tingling in fingers and toes. Hands are also a bit dry (have been for about 10 days) -kind of like you describe, Edi. The Benadryl really knocked me out, so I was sound asleep in the chair for about 2 hrs! My port was not cooperating - finally were able to get some blood after tipping me back in the chair so I was practically standing on my head, and then having me turn my head to the left. Thanks to my DH tattling about this difficulty to my MO, I am now on Coumadin. Movie, your gym regimen sounds impressive! Seems like your DD is putting you through your paces.

Websister, I looked your cancer center up on the Internet some time ago - I believe when Benny was having some difficulty - and it appears to be a wonderful facility. Edi - poor wrinkly butt - nothing seems to be going his way! I wonder if he realizes he has an international following? Nihahi - hard to believe your surgery is so close!

At least I asked DH to make dinner tonight, and he complied. Jennie and Benny, I saw a PT/LE specialist for about 6 weeks (starting maybe 6 weeks post-surgery) and I think it really helped. In addition to giving me exercises, she worked on my arm to reduce possible chording and spent a lot of time massaging the skin and tissue around my scar to limber it up (have to say, that part hurt like hell). Trying to do better with the exercises now that I'm in radiation - she said there was a good chance I'd tighten up during radiation and have to go back for more sessions. Most of the initial tingling I had post-surgery is gone, and when I was measured at the end of March, the ROM in my left (affected) arm was better than that in my right! Carla and Traii (and anyone experiencing neuropathy), RO said today that acupuncture may help. I put sessions with DO who was giving me acupuncture treatments on hold while in radiation, but maybe I should go back. Edi, so good to have you back. I'm sure you'll make a fantastic volunteer - they will be very lucky to have you on their roster! Movie, glad you're getting over your jet lag. Would like to hear more details of your trip. Nihahi, hope your DD's move goes smoothly. Traii, surely to goodness you'll hear something about your surgery this week! I agree with others - might be time to rattle their chain. Dakota, don't know how you keep up with all those sports activities - congrats to your son! Ok, now I'm getting sleepy again. Love to everybody else!",

Hope to build up distance and frequency before going back to the gym. No rads today - something about a power outage and a blown transformer put them out of operation. When she phoned to tell me my session was cancelled, the always cheery technician admitted that the upside of the situation for her was that she got to see some firemen today - I was just as happy to have a break. Good grief Websister - no wonder your MIL decided against surgery. I hope that she continues to do reasonably well. Feel so sorry for our MILs facing not just cancer, but very nasty types of cancer, at their age. Liefie, that's wonderful that you were able to get together with some fellow BC survivors for lunch. Will be nice if it becomes a regular thing. I'm going to catch up with a work friend who went through non-Hodgkins treatment last year sometime soon to compare notes. Something comforting about sharing experiences with somebody who has been through it. I learned a couple of weeks ago that another coworker who I haven't seen in awhile is in treatment for BC now - so need to connect with her too. Dakota, have to admit that I'm, ahem, cheering for Chicago. Wasn't going to watch any more hockey this year after Toronto lost, but my nephew is a Chicago fan, so started watching again when he was visiting. No matter who wins, it's pretty cool to see an Original Six final. Hope you are all well. Maria, will send you a FB friend request.",

Traii, so glad to hear you're doing well post-surgery and letting your Mum look after you.  Hope the drains will be out soon! Morwenna, re: the port, I had mine out just over 3 weeks ago and I didn't feel a thing, not even a pinch or a twinge - no pain whatsoever.  It was more of a relief than I expected to be free of it and hopefully I won't ever need another one (mine stopped working for blood draws after Round 5 of chemo). Liefie, congratulations on your news - very exciting!!  Our grandson (well, actually, I'll be a step-grandparent) is due in less than 2 weeks now.  Should be all clear to travel after Friday (last radiation treatment!!) so if all goes well DH and I will fly down to visit soon after the baby arrives (although there will be 3 other sets of grandparents wanting to see him too - a sign of the times!). Edi, so sorry that you're feeling down.  I understand that your dx must have come as a blow.  That seems to be the way of cancer - you just wrap your head around one version of the new reality when another curveball is thrown your way.  You seemed to be looking forward to the volunteering so much and I'm sure you'd find it so rewarding - it makes no sense for your DH to kick up a fuss about you going.  I wonder if there isn't something going on with him that he can't express.  My DH seems to oscillate between being protective of me, including telling me I shouldn't be doing anything that might tire me, and seemingly being surprised that I don't always feel like cooking or cleaning, for example (well, let's face it - I rarely feel like cleaning, even in the best of times).  Let me tell you, we've had some MAJOR screaming rows during the latter part of my treatment.  He has been an absolute prince at times and a royal pain at others.  As I may have told you, things were so bad when my sisters were here in May that they sent Mum down as a mediator/buffer after they returned to Canada.  Anyway, we've been doing better for the past month or so, but still manage to have the occasional shouting match.  Think I am so focused on my treatment and just getting through it while working that I sometimes forget how stressful this is for him too.  In addition to my illness, he's had to deal with his mother being diagnosed in April (she had her nephrectomy 2 weeks ago and is recovering in a rehab facility, seems to be doing well), and his lawsuit against his employer coming to a head (mediation hearing tomorrow, trial in October if they don't settle).  I just don't think men know how to cope with that stress very well and that they may tend to take it out on us as a result.  We should probably see a marriage counselor like Peggy, but so far I haven't arranged it (finally got him to agree to it).  BTW, he never says anything about it, but I know he reads the Breast Cancer Husband book you (Edi) recommended from time to time. Well, speaking of cleaning, must try to do some.  My brother will be in town on business this week and is staying with me for a few days.  And yes, Nihahi, I'm still eating fresh veggies so will have to decide what combination of them to cook tonight.",

I guess the combination of the discussion on here and watching Julie and Julia inspired me to roast a chicken for the first time in my life - hence the turkey baster. Have told DH that I'm going to try my hand at French cuisine on Sundays. Anyway, Poulet Poele a l'Estragon and lemon soufflé were hits - Brussel sprouts and roasted potatoes were just a tad under done. Why has a 52-year old woman never roasted a chicken in her life - well, because I've been a vegetarian for 38 years (although reintroduced fish to my diet 4 years ago). Anyway, DH seemed appreciative of my efforts, and I enjoyed the cooking. Liefie, won't be long now until you're on your way - I hope you have a wonderful time in SA. Kind of divine providence that your DH 'a gall bladder issues were picked up during his training, rather than his official test. Websister, Christmas crafting on a wintry afternoon sounds like a lot of fun. DH and I are also receiving updates on each new milestone grandson hits - definitely something to bring a smile and a reason to celebrate! Edi, shared with you that I had this fantasy that BC would propel DH and me into our own Shades of Grey - a romantic and sexual rebirth - but alas, NOTHING could be further from the truth! Still, I haven't given up hope - I often think that if DH and I could get our acts together sufficiently to have even one perfect day, I could leave this world in peace. Momo, sorry to hear that the tree did not pan out. Have to say my ideal is still a real tree. Cheating a bit this year - spending Christmas in Nova Scotia with my brother and family and he always has a 10 ft+ real tree that they go out and pick from a tree farm and chop down themselves. I hope your purple tree will fill you with joy. You know, I find once the lights are on, it doesn't much matter what's underneath! Traii, hope your DS has a great farm visit - something amusing about heading to a farm on a double decker bus! Benny, good luck re: finding advice re: how to get chicken poop out of a white carpet - think those are two things that don't usually go together! It's wonderful that your chickens roam free in your house! Does anybody watch Duck Dynasty? Said to DH over dinner tonight, \"I have to confess that you sound a whole lot and look a little bit like Phil Robertson\". DH's response? \"I've noticed that myself -although I actually think I'm more like Jase\". Ah, southern men - gotta love 'em. Time to Skype with my sisters, then put in a call to my MIl.

I know when we originally thought I had little or no lymph node involvement, IU specialist advised that there was no advantage to 6 rounds of TC over 4 - and I know there is at least one clinical trial behind this thinking. As for Carla, my recollection was that of the 22 lymph nodes she had removed, there was one node that showed very minor involvement - apparently so minute that it wasn't considered positive? I sent her a paper when she was trying to decide between 4 rounds of TC and 6 - can look for it again if you like (my hard drive has died since, so don't have the paper on hand). Like your MO, mine was trying to protect me from the \"red devil\" - and I was torn right up until the morning I started chemo - but in the end I decided I had to opt for the big guns, on the basis of being told my BC was \"a monster\". Have to say I haven't looked back and don't intend to - what's done is done. In terms of side effects, the AC did a number on my GI tract, but it's almost back to normal. Still have some neuropathy in my feet, mainly big toes, from the Taxol. Long term effects are of greater concern, but so far so good.",

I've been to the Wirral once, albeit almost 30 years ago. At one point in university, I shared a house with 2 other Canadian girls and 3 British guys. One of them was from the Wirral. Another became my boyfriend/fiancé and when I visited him in Wales, we met up with our other room-mate in the Wirral. Still remember taking a ferry ride across the Mersey. Sorry about your blood draw issues, Morwenna. I seem to recall from another thread that you and I have the same or similar platelet disorder. I didn't have any problem during chemo, except that my port would not work for blood draws for the last 3 rounds - I had to go on oral Coumadin then. Now that I'm on Tamoxifen, my MO (who was simply my hematologist before BC) has me on a full aspirin per day plus Anagrelide (reduces my platelet count). No sign of the keys - this is what comes from jockeying back and forth between two houses in two states - I never know where anything is! We were going to head to Kentucky, where I hope the keys are, tonight, but the roads are too slick. Good luck with your homework, Websister! You write so well that I'm sure your story will be well received by others in your group. Nihahi, thanks for the update on Benny - hope she will feel like returning here soon.",

Received final pathology results last week and they were quite of disheartening.  Despite all the imaging I had post-diagnosis, there was a surprise second tumor present in the same breast, plus heavy lymph node involvement (10/25 positive).  Was feeling kind of down about that, but have seen posts from other women on various threads with a lot of positive lymph nodes who are still doing well 5 - 10 years out, so have to work on getting my head on straight, rather than becoming defeatist. So now there's no doubt about me doing chemo - scheduled to start 6 rounds of T/C on Thursday (but having a quick check in with my second opinion doc tomorrow to get her take - mainly about elevated risks associated with my blood disorder/malignancy).  Will also have radiation to both chest and armpit/shoulder area post-chemo.

My oncologist has recommended 6 cycles of Taxotere/Cyclophosphamide (then surgery, then radiation, then hormone therapy).  Have been reading all I can about how to minimize side effects and trying to decide in advance what to incorporate.  Has anybody here, if you've been on Taxotere, iced your fingers and/or toes during infusion?  Willing to try anything if it will help. Re: kefir, I've had it a few times in the past, and find it quite tasty.  Based on the discussion here, I picked up a little 4-pack of it today, advertising its probiotic properties.  I've been reading \"Life Over Cancer\" by Dr. Keith Block and trying to improve my nutritional habits in preparation for chemo - but I realize the focus might shift to just getting anything down and keeping it down once I start treatment.  I'd appreciate any nutritional tips any of you might have.  Like Benny, I've been a vegetarian for decades, although I reintroduced fish to my diet a few years ago.  To be honest though, I haven't been a \"good\" vegetarian recently - too much junk food/fast food.  Now it's back to lots of veggies and beans - my husband is LOVING it, to say the least. Anyway, I hope the coming week goes well for all of you!",

He performed acupuncture on me and did some other minor manipulations. Can't tell if it helped with the nausea or not - but I did feel as if I had more energy when I came out of there. The thing I appreciated most was that he is the first provider to have a chat with me about the spiritual/mental aspects of dealing with cancer. He claims stress is just a conflict between our expectations and reality, so he advised that I accept my new reality, maintain a positive attitude, and live in the moment. Also gave some nutritional advice. Hope you all have a wonderful Valentines Day!",

However, although I had some esophageal and GI burn, I seem to have been spared the full on mucositis that has plagued Benny, at least for this round (now Day 9). I drank a LOT of water during the first few days when I felt reasonably well and also rinsed/gargled with salt/baking soda/water and Biotene mouthwash - not sure if that helped ward off sores or not. I lost my appetite for a few days, but at no point did I feel like I couldn't eat - the burn didn't make it all the way up to my throat. The advice the osteopath gave me was interesting. While it contained some specifics, it was in some ways more focused on a general approach to eating. 1. Avoid or at least limit foods that generate heat, e.g. sweets, dairy, gluten. 2. If you crave foods in 1., indulge your craving, but in moderation. Eat with joy, not guilt. 3. Avoid caffeine, except for tea with honey. 4. No matter how hungry you are, or how good the food tastes, don't over eat. Always stay just a little bit hungry. 5. Drink sun-heated water (I.e. place a pitcher of water in a window where it can be heated by the sun) - he said this is recommended for cancer patients. When drinking hot or cold liquids, hold them in your mouth for a few seconds so that they equalize with your body temperature. Keep water with you at all times. Sip, don't gulp. I'm seeing a more traditional dietician on Monday to talk about best protein sources when dealing with ER+ tumors. I want to learn more about the soy controversy. She said she would dig out some papers for me, so I'll pass on anything interesting that she shares with me. Adagio, I sincerely hope that all goes well for you in your chemo treatment tomorrow.

Yes, I found when the PT guided me through the stretches, I got a better sense of where the limits were - it wasn't so much that she was pushing beyond where I had a lot of pain (certainly it's always bearable) but beyond where I started to feel pulling or like my movement was restricted, so that I was afraid to push further.

Sounds like your boys had a great time together and glad they made it to Edmonton safely. Still feeling the effects of chemo - bone/joint pain, neuropathy mainly in toes and soles of feet, constipation (from taking pain meds). Also, for a few weeks now, it sometimes feels like my stomach is trying to eat itself. Mentioned to my MO, but he seems to think it's to be expected. Also, find I tire very easily. Mum and I have been skyping almost nightly with my sis -and since we're both pretty tired at the end of the day, it's always a shock when we get a look at ourselves. Mum said \"I look like the nursing home special\" and I added \"that's nothing - I look like Jean Drapeau\" (there's one for you Canadians out there).

I hope that you will have a fulfilling relaxing trip. Traii, think Liefie's right re: having your DS spend a few days with his grandparents after your surgery. I'm sure it will be hard to be apart, but might give you a head start on recovery. Maria, hope AC is treating you kindly on this first round, My head became very itchy and sore right before my hair started falling out - about 14 - 16 days after the first treatment.

Saw periodontist 3 weeks ago for check up and clean (had LANAP procedure on my gums not long before BC diagnosis) and although I didn't actually shed any tears, I certainly had a few moments of feeling very low and wondering if I was going to be able to stand it - physically or psychologically. At moments like those, I always think \"this is what a cat or dog must feel like when they go to the vet\".

So went in today not knowing which way to go, but after discussing with my onc, who had also discussed with my second opinion onc, we opted for dose-dense ACT. They both said \"you're young, you're healthy - you can handle this regimen\" and I'm thinking \"I'm 51, and I have advanced breast cancer - what am I missing here?\". Anyway, decided what the heck, I'll give it a go. A bit scared because of the problems Benny has had, but know another woman who did dose dense ACT with few problems and is still going strong (6 years out). Just depends on the individual, as you all know. Ladies, I can relate to what some of you have said about the well-meaning friend. One friend of mine was incredibly supportive during my surgery, but she keeps questioning my treatment choices, and every time she does, I feel stressed. Main thing is she keeps saying I should drop my MO (have been seeing him for 6 years for my blood disorder) in favor of MO I've seen for 2nd opinions. Finally asked 2nd opinion doc yesterday if, given my now high risk situation, I should switch to her. She said absolutely not necessary - my onc has been doing good job for 6 years) - so hope that issue has been laid to rest. Sometimes I don't know if friends realize how important it is for us to have a plan, and to have confidence in that plan. MO said to me today, once you head down a path, don't ever look back, feel any guilt, or second guess you choices, regardless of what happens. Think sometimes friends find it hard to know when they should voice their concerns, and when, if they truly care about us, they should remain silent. Okay, time to pee and hope for sleep. Had a great evening tonight. My brother from Canada was here along with 3 friends. One friend (former neighbor from when we were growing up in Canada who lives on other side of town) prepared dinner and it was delicious (guess nausea meds are working so far). I laughed until I cried when Mum phoned up and started to tell us a story (on speaker) about the time someone (and the someone turned out to be a woman) bought Dad a pair of leather pants (which she then admitted were actually shorts). Guess our minds were all in the gutter and we could not stop laughing - Mum was not impressed. Wishing everyone a wonderful weekend ahead!",
