The doc said it felt \"squishy\", and every time I feel it, it definitely does not. So I don't know what he means. I know one woman with a moveable lump in her breast. She was diagnosed with breast cancer.   My question is: How many women (here or elsewhere) have had a moveable lump, perhaps only in one breast, that turned out to be breast cancer? What are the percentages? Not really concerned at this point. The doc referred me to someone else, who will do either a fine needle aspiration or an ultrasound. Can't find ANY info on the entire net that talks about cancerous lumps being moveable. But I know someone for whom it was cancerous. The percentages may be with me, but I almost feel like I'd be wasting my time.   \"Belief in a cruel God makes a cruel man.\"- Thomas Payne Dx Log in to post a reply",
