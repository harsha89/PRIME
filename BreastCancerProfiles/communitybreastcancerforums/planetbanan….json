      "Content": "Jun 29, 2012 12:54PM - edited Jun 29, 2012 12:57PM by planetbananas Lilypad, my tuesday port sister!  I am one who cut off all my hair, a week prior to my surgery. It is about 2 -3\" at the moment. My hair has always been long, and I knew it was thick and took a lot of product and hot irons to make it straight, what I didn't know is that my hair is SO thick that it is unmanageable at 2\" - it sticks straight up and out lol.... Tomorrow I am getting a real buzz and maybe a faux-hawk for fun. Losing my hair is one thing, I am dreading the eyelashes/brows the most. My friend has dared me to show up for chemo wearing one of those hats that hold beers on either side of your head and have tube straws attached....I wouldn't dare but the mental image sent me into major giggles so I thought I would share.... Thank you mebmarj and moderators for all the tips, they are so helpful.  Also, on my blog I started a page where I am documenting my resonstruction with photos at each stage. The link to my blog is in my profile (I am not selling anything, just a blog). My blog might not be for all tastes, the reconstruction page can be accessed seperately from all writing. For some reason, I have no shame about showing the results/progress and I would have loved to see what you can really expect from this process before hand. Mods, if this is inappropriate, please delete, not sure what the rules are. ",

Getting a port on Tuesday, then scans and  starting 8 rounds FEC-100 and Taxotere within 10 days, not sure of exact date. The day after every infusion I have to go back and get a shot of Neulasta although they are trying to see if my insurance will cover a self-injectable from a pharmacy so that I don't have to make another trip. I posted in another thread about how emotional it was to see the chemo area yesterday and realize I would be there through Thanksgiving and Christmas. I did meet 2 of the nurses though and they were very very kind.  Has anyone else had a port inserted? Any tips on what to expect? they showed me one, along with a diagram of where it would go and it creeped me out a little.  ",

I am taking all the meds religiously, like clockwork. At first I felt like I would only take certain ones but in doing all of them I must say that while I am extremely tired, I am only a little naseous. I have a Champion juicer and juiced a pint of straight ginger juice. I have been drinking it 1/4 cup at at time, mixed in a liter of water. If any of you has a juicer that can juice ginger, I highly recommend it. It gives me a little energy as well as helping my stomach. So far, so good. I don't know if it will change and I was told the hair would be going around day 14 so we will see. Sending good thoughts to all. ",

So many of us have been judged for our treatment and decisions so I am surprised to see harsh judgement (like saying she just had a boob job) on these boards. Women judge each other enough, it would be nice to have a kinder environment here. Some of the comments have really saddened me. We can disagree and question with respect and kindness and I hope to see some of that going forward. As to the idea of having a greater responsibility because AJ is in the public eye, well she is still only human. Let her be a lightening rod for debate, not a projection of anger at your own disease.",

Yes, bc is the gift that keeps giving, one of the meds gave me renal insufficiency and the worst nausea since taxotere. They didn't do a biopsy, but they did do a ct scan of the implant. I think I waited too long to address the issue, I should have gone to dr at first sign of redness/leaking but nothing like this has ever happened. It was on the side that they took 14 nodes. So, don't wait if you see a problem, I wouldn't wish this last experience on my worst enemy! Good luck with the biopsy!",
