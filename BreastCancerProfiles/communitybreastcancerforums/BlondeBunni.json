About 2 years ago, I found a lump in both of my breasts. When I first discovered them, I noticed that during my period they would get smaller. Not having insurance, I googled the symptoms and believed that they were cysts, the one on my right side gradually got smaller over the last 2 years until I could no longer feel it. I kept making excuses to not go to the doctor out of fear. Due to several different events in my life, I finally went to the doctor two weeks ago. So far because of the size of the lump in my left breast, you can actually see if clearly when I lay down, I have had an ultrasound and mammogram on both breasts. To my surprise, the lump that I thought had disappeared in my right breast, is still there but really small. I returned to my doctor last week for a consultation to review the results and he has referred me to a surgeon for a biopsy. So I am playing the waiting game right now and am driving myself crazy with worry, especially after finding out that my aunt died at 34 from breast cancer. Are there any clear signs that I can look for to try an ease all of the stress and anxiety? Log in to post a reply",

And honestly, what scares me the most is the fact, that there is no pain associated with all of this and everything I have read seems to point at cancer because there is no pain. I am still waiting to get the tests done and I am driving myself crazy with all this waiting.",

On August 9, 2012, I went to get a physical, the 1st time in 6 years due to not having insurance, and my doctor was severely concerned about the mass in my left breast. He scheduled an ultrasound for the following day, which ended up being a full mammogram and a second ultrasound because they found a smaller mass on the right side. I was told that I was going to need a biopsy and they would let my doctor know. I was scheduled for a consultation with my doctor on Auggust 15th, my birthday, he agreed that the mass in my left breast was suspicious and he would be scheduling a biopsy. It is now October 3rd, I have yet to receive a referral from my primary doctor, even though I have pretty much called everday, and to top it all off I am having issues with my insurance company, who is denying all claims due to pre-existing clause. I am suposed to finally be scheduling my biopsy today, after having to go to where I had my ultrasound and mammogram done to get something done. I received my results from my ultrasound and mammogram yesterday, that stated that there is a chance that I have a phyllode tumor. I am 28 years old and  have 3 small children (6, 8, & 10 year old boys), so all of this waiting is killing me from the inside out. I am going to keep my fingers crossed that I am able to finall get an apppointment for this biopsy that is long overdue. Sick & Tired of Waiting -- BlondeBunni",
