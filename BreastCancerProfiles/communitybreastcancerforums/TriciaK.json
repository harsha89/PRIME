      "Content": "Jun 10, 2010 04:06PM - edited Jun 10, 2010 04:08PM by TriciaK Hi Ann,  I agree with your surgeon and think you do have time to research and consider which surgery is right for rather than leaping in and regretting it later on.  After your surgery you'll get a full picture of what you're dealing with from the path report, that will indicate enough for you to know if chemo is necesary.  If it is, I also would hold back on making any new commitments as you don't know how you'll respond and for me, fatigue was a huge issue. I know your daughter may be disappointed now, but as  a Mom of two adult daughter's I can tell you she'll fully understand one day and not blame you:) I also had a weeks vacation before my surgery, it was good for me and gave me a chance to prepare for my future treatment emotionally.  Enjoy it, and most of all know you can do this!!!  I'm five years out next month from a very aggressive cancer and eighteen months of treatment, time really does heal:) Tricia x  P.S...I forgot to say the path report from surgery will indicate grade, hormonal status, her2 etc which will all determine your future treatment.  Feel free to pm me if you have any questions.",

I've had backache for some time and my bone scan showed a suspicious area in the thoraic region. This was followed by an inconclusive mri and a clear pet/ct. I also have pain very low down on the right side of abdomen and am wondering if this could be liver/womb/uterus??   I had my ovaries removed after chemo, any advice or thoughts would be welcome before I see my onc next Wed.
