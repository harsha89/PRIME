I have a chronic, debilitating health condition and my system would be too weak to tolerate chemotherapy or radiation, but I would be open to surgery to remove the cancer. So I'm wondering whether I should bother to get a mammogram since I would be intolerant of chemo or radiation. So, I have two questions: 1) Under what circumstances is breast cancer treated with surgery only? 2) If a mammogram finds a tiny, pinpoint-size cancer, can they cut that out? Or is chemo or radiation required for this? Thanks for any advice from the experts here! Log in to post a reply",
