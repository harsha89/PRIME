I'm single and without kids.I don't drink and I don't consume any sugar or food that converts to sugar in the body, because of my family history. I go so far as to make my own mayo to stay sugar-free! I'm noticing weird changes with my left breast. For the last few years, I've had a scaly left nipple that has come and gone. I assumed it was excema and never mentioned it to anyone. I've been having night sweats only in the upper chest/neck area for about 6 months and I've lost 40 lbs with little effort ( I HAVE been watching what I eat but not counting calories or dieting per se). I've been struggling with fatigue this year, too. Otherwise I'm totally healthy. Yesterday, I woke up to find spontaneous yellow, sticky discharge from one duct in my left nipple that was all over my shirt. It had an odor. It continued all day and today. I have no pain, but my breast has a slightly reddish/bruised look to it, and my areola, when erect, is going from round shape to more of an oblong shape. The right areola stays round. I noticed that there is a wart-like bump that is very red on the center of my left nipple, too. Never had a wart of any sort so I don't know what this is. There is a tiny, immobile pea-sized lump near the nipple, but in the breast tissue that I hadn't noticed before.  I've been on Augmentin 875 for a week now for an unrelated infection, and then this starts out of the blue. My aunt tells me if this were a breast infection, that Augmentin would clear it up, and that I would likely have pain. I don't. She is a nurse and is worried about the sudden changes in the absence of signs of infection.  My lymph nodes are swollen under my left armpit, left neck and under my left clavicle. I can't get into a doctor until early January.  I'm very worried. I'm not looking for anyone to hold my hand, offer (knowingly) false reassurances, etc. I really would like to know what I'm likely facing! I'm a straight shooter and can deal with whatever comes my way, I just need to know what I'm dealing with! I'm afraid waiting 12 days is going to kill me (emotionally)! Does this sound like I should be as worried as I am?? Thanks in advance! Trish Log in to post a reply",
