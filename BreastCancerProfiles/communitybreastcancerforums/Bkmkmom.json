Of course the thought of cancer arises when you have a new lump. Everybody person I've been in contact with so far has used the clock position so i just assumed that was the correct terminology. I'm glad to see that you think it's most likely nothing. I guess I was hoping this Page would help me decide what to do when there are two totally different opinions with the recheck. Thanks for the input",

      "Content": "Bkmkmom wrote: hi all. A while back I noticed a lump on my left breast at the 9:00 position. I watched it for a few months and when I hadn't gone away I made an appointment with my dr. She sent me for mammogram and ultrasound that day. The results came back that they believe I have a benign mass with dense tissue and scan again in 4 months to compare. She decided to send me to a breast specialist as a precaution and it was an awful appointment. He hardly did an exam. Said I'm young (34) and healthy and he doesn't feel this mass?? He told me I can comeback back in 8-12 months to recheck if i want. I'm confsed that I, my husband, my dr and radiologists feel this lump and he made me feel crazy like I wasted his time. He also didn't want another scan. What do I do now? Log in to post a reply",
