Thank you for your honesty, and for your genuine concern. I will keep you informed as I move along. I would also like to know how you are doing as well. I am so glad I decided to speak out loud about my current concern. I hope your Birthday is full of happiness for you. Thanks again for sharing your story, and for leading me in the right direction. ",

      "Content": "trstamper wrote: I am 45 years old. I have never had a mamo that wasn't of good report. I have been unable to get a mamo in a couple of years. I always do self checks monthly. Just recently I began to hurt on the inside of my clevage area toward my right breast. It hurts even when I'm not touching it. I tried to feel for a lump or swelling, and I'm just not sure. I believe I felt something small deep against the bone. I'm just very concerned. I will make a phone call to my pcp on Monday. The pain is pretty bad when I touch the area. Really sore and tender. I am currently taking care of my Mother who has lung cancer and just recently had two strokes. It's a 24/7 position and honor to help her. I thought that maybe I was just so tired and stressed that my immune system may be weakening or something. I would appreciate any advice. Whether it scares me or not. I just don't want to panic, I don't think my mind or body can take it. Log in to post a reply",
