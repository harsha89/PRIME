You all are so brave.  I am nervous about the biopsy, but it's good to know I can come to this forum for support through it all.  Thank you.",

My father and his family all had cancer.  Just seven days ago, I noticed a breast lump.  It felt large, but I'd never noticed it before.  Within two days, I was at the gynecologist's office, and she ordered a mammogram. Earlier today, I had the mammo plus an ultrasound.  They had to keep taking the mammo over and over again because the lump was so far back.  The doctor there said it looks malignant because it's a \"solid lesion\" and it's spiculated (spiked?), meaning it's affecting the tissue around it.  It's 1.5 cm.  He said the lymph nodes don't look enlarged on the ultrasound.  But, he seemed very grim; he's sure it's cancer.  I ran home to hug my kids, and my husband came home early to hug me. I have an appointment for a biopsy with a breast surgeon in two weeks.  Now I'm hoping that doctor was wrong and this isn't cancer.  I'm wondering if he's rushing to a conclusion based on my family history.  I once had a vaginal tumor removed that turned out to be benign.  Has anyone here had a spiculated lesion that turned out to be benign?  Thank you, and thoughts and prayers for all of you. 2011: Left MX w/TE (Ki67: 60%) AC x 4, Taxol x 12, Radiation, Tamoxifen, BRCA2+ Dec. 2012: Right prophylactic MX w/TE, ooph; June 2013: Final exchange; Nov. 2013: Fat grafting; 2014: Arimidex; 2015: Femara REST IN PEACE, MELANIE Dx 11/23/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 2/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I pray that it is not cancer, after all, and if it is, that the doctors can help her in the way that she decides is best for her. {{Hugs}}",

      "Content": "grayeyes wrote: I posted here last week under \"New, shocked and worried\".  Quick review:  I just turned 46, married, three children.  The youngest is 9.  Following a mammogram and ultrasound, the doctor at the radiology center told me I have a 1.5 cm solid lesion that is spiculated.  He is sure it is cancer.  But, the biopsy won't be done until this Thursday.  I'm under a tremendous amount of stress for other reasons, and now this has upped the level of stress, as I'm worrying, not knowing if I have cancer spread throughout my body.  He said the lymph nodes on the mammo don't look swollen, but I've been reading that a 1.5 cm tumor could have metasticized.  Plus, I've been feeling fatigued for awhile now, which I thought was due to not getting enough sleep and not exercising.  Now I'm wondering...  I'm also worried about every little pain. Also, I read some tumors can grow within a couple of weeks.  I wish I could be in a hospital right now having everything done all at once.  My father felt the same way when he had cancer:  Being an outpatient was the worst part of it all, because all you do is wait and worry. My husband has been more than supportive.  But, aside from the internet, there's no one else around whom I can talk to.  I told my brother, and we agreed I should wait for the biopsy before telling my mother because she won't be able to handle it, after losing my father three years ago.  I know many people, but I have no close friends with whom to confide.  And we definitely don't want to tell our children until we have all the information ourselves, although they sense that something is wrong. Anyway, I've been researching, and I read about APBI.  I was excited about the possibility that, if the tumor is small enough, and if the cancer hasn't spread, they might be able to target the radiation to one area in 1 - 5 days. Then, last night, I found out there is a technology called Cyberknife that destroys tumors using pinpoint radiation.  I found articles that said it could be used for breast tumors.  I was so hopeful.  But, today, I called the Cyberknife center near me and was told they never use it on breast tumors.  I looked up more info and found that doctors prefer to radiate the entire breast.  But, doesn't APBI pinpoint radition, too? If anyone here has any experience with APBI or Cyberknife, I'd appreciate knowing more. Also, when my father was ill, and I was desperately looking for a way to save his life, I read about people using Intravenous Vitamin C.  There are doctors around here who will give it to cancer patients.  But, there are no studies to back it up.  Has anyone here ever used IV Vit C as either a treatment, a supplement, or both? These two weeks have been awful.  I know we're all in the same situation.  I'm trying to hold it all together and be strong, but I'm having a hard time.  I'm so grateful for this forum.  Thank you again.  2011: Left MX w/TE (Ki67: 60%) AC x 4, Taxol x 12, Radiation, Tamoxifen, BRCA2+ Dec. 2012: Right prophylactic MX w/TE, ooph; June 2013: Final exchange; Nov. 2013: Fat grafting; 2014: Arimidex; 2015: Femara REST IN PEACE, MELANIE Dx 11/23/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 2/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I admire the strength I see here.  I hope my post didn't frighten any of the other newbies.  I was just flipping out.",
