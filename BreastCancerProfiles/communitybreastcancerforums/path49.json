She recommended different bras Â to try on and then we decided together if they worked well or not. She also tried a couple different size of prostheses and recommended one of those too. My suggestion is to call some shops that sell these and let them know you will be coming. This woman was so great that the whole process was so much easier than I had expected. Good luck! You'll do just fine.",
