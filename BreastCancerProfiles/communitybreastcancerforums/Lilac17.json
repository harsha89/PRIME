But according to your post, there is enough to test. How long are our specimens kept? My biopsy was done at the end of April and here we are in August",

      "Content": "Lilac17 wrote: Hi, I was diagnosed with stage 1a IDC and DCIS - both in my right breast in May. The IDC was removed during the core biopsy and I had 3 lumpectomies to clear the DCIS which failed so I had a bilateral mastectomy on August 3. I met with my oncologist yesterday. He talked odds of this coming back over the next 20 years, and my odds weren\u2019t as low as I had hoped for but still lower than some I suppose. He is putting me on a tamoxifen after I heal a bit more and my odds will be cut a bit still. The odds game really upset me and I\u2019ve cried ever since that appointment. I\u2019m wondering about how others reacted to their odds and how do you begin to live again with this worry on your shoulder. I feel like I\u2019m on borrowed time and I have 4 young kids to raise Thanks Dx 5/1/2018, LCIS/DCIS/IDC, Right, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 5/16/2018 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 6/8/2018 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 6/27/2018 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 8/3/2018 Mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Left; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Log in to post a reply",
