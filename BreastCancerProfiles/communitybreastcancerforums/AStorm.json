It is hard to get doctors to tell you what to do, but in addition to the margins not being clear, and finding another smaller tumor, there was DCIS and some \"atypical\" cells in the breast with the lumpectomy. Due to a scary family history and my fear of recurrence, I decided on bilateral mastectomy. They biopsied the tissue from both breasts after the mastectomies and the pathology report from both breasts showed atypical hyperplasia but no actual cancer. This is a very personal decision and no one, not even your doctors,  can tell you what is best for you. I found that very frustrating. To help me collect and organize information and define my objectives and priorities, I put together a detailed \"presentation\" for myself to help make decisions about treatment and reconstruction. The process took the emotion out of the decision, allowed me to focus on my personal objectives, and even though I had done a lot of research already I realized there were holes. I am having some trouble with the reconstruction and emotional issues right now (4 weeks post-op). That presentation is something concrete that I can go back to to support my decisions.",

      "Content": "Jan 18, 2010 10:05AM - edited Jan 18, 2010 10:08AM by AStorm I was Stage 1 and had bilateral MX after seeing the pathology from the lumpectomy (margins not clear due to small \"bonus\" tumor and atypical cells). I was 47 at diagnosis but I've had issues for years... lumps that we watched with mammograms and ultrasound... fiberous cysts... visits to the surgeon so that we could establish a relationship (!). I lost an aunt to breast cancer many years ago, but my Mom and another of her sisters had full recovery. I heard the statistic: lumpectomy + radiation = mastectomy... but what they are really talking about is *survival* rate, not recurrence. Although the 5-year survival rate may be the same for both types of treatment, some women will be treating a recurrence in that 5 years, so it really depends on how each woman feels about her own personal recurrence risk and ability/willingness to deal with that.   Maybe mastectomy sounds pretty radical for Stage 1, but I've been afraid of my breasts most of my life and I really needed to reduce my risk of recurrence. I had immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders which will be replaced with implants this week. It was a really difficult decision for me and I still second guess myself from time to time. But I did one thing that has made it easier for me to come to terms with it:  I wrote a research paper on my options, my objectives for the final outcome, and the pros and cons of each option. In PowerPoint. no kidding. It helped me gather information and look at it with a little less emotion, and also helped me realize that every woman faces a different challenge with breast cancer and allowed me to frame the data for my own case. I laughed at myself a little... such a business-like approach to such a personal issue. But now, when I'm having a bad day I can pull out that report to remind myself that my decision was based on sound consideration of my options and that it was the right decision for me. ",

After the surgery all the surgeon said was that he didn't suspect node involvement so I went away for the weekend and had a nice time with my family. Then on Monday we discussed the pathology and that he needed to go back in. Since I was already on the fence about lumpectomy versus mastectomy, I did some more research and decided the multi-focal was a gift - maybe a gentle message from my guardian angel - so I had bilteral mastectomies and reconstruction. Swanseagirl -- My onco ordered the OncotypeDX. Not everyone is tested - depends on the type of tumor I think, but you should discuss it with your docs. Avoiding chemo is a high priority for me because I have a really sensitive system and my home life is too chaotic and not conducive to downtime. Cake  - Congrats! I'm right behind you (6/26).

It might be reassuring for you to realize that you haven't made a decision that limits what you do in the future.

It does sound like you are taking more than one treatment for the same purpose but maybe they are complementary. Your oncotype score is a little higher than mine and I'm 5 years older (closer to meno) and maybe those factors affect your treatment. BTW, I have had hot flashes on tamox but I think I'm starting to get control of them without additional meds (I limit alcohol, coffee and spicy foods, exercise, sleep in cotton with the windows WIDE open).",

My tumor was also small but I wanted to make sure there was no improvement in the risk of recurrence before I opted out of chemo. Your score is low but I'm sure you take some comfort in knowing that. I read about ovarian suppression and since I have osteoporosis in our family history (as well as bc) my onco's opinion was that allowing some estrogen would protect my bones. I'm 48 so I'm a little closer to meno. We keep checking hormone levels though because the onco wants to get me off tamox when I am officially postmeno. I saw my BS last week and he suggested Effexor for hot flashes but I haven't tried it yet... it seems every time I take another drug it causes a different problem. ",

I perused it at the bookstore but since I don't have time to read it right now, didn't pick it up. It has a lot of recommendations for us. My attitude about such things is a tad laissez-faire since my diagnosis as I DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS and still got cancer, but I liked what he had to say about wine (he points out that studies with respect to breast cancer and alcohol are inconclusive and controversial and counters that red wine has beneficial properties that should be considered, and then he recommends a glass of red wine with dinner).  My mom grew asparagus when I was a kid and I still eat a lot of it... but MIMI, I agree -- Crystal and Casey are the best! Maybe Crystal misses her child :(  or maybe it's just her personality... it kind of bugged me last night when the judges chastised her for hiding behind her guitar and using a rug as her 'only prop'. Does everyone have to be perky and flirtatious and wear thigh-hi stiletto boots?",

Re-ex was an option but I chose BMx instead because I didn't want to worry about recurrence. After surgery when I began to regret my decision I pulled out my \"report\" and reminded myself why I chose this option.
