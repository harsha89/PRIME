She and my brother saw the surgeon on a Thursday, I flew in from out-of-state over the weekend, and she had the BMX on the following Tuesday. Her surgery was just a week from when she got the phone call about the biopsy. Scheduling the surgery quickly and having a BMX was what was important to her. Her cancer was Stage II.

I stopped the Tamoxifen on January 1st and the hip pain went completely away within a few days. I didn't go for the x-rays.",

I had no reason for not making those appointments. Finally, I figured out that even though I would go to the MO, staying away from all the other doctors was a way of pretending that I didn't have cancer. Once I figured that out, I made the appointments and have seen all the doctor's except I still need to go see the eye doctor (who knew BC can go to the eyes, that's what he shared with me on my last visit, no wonder I stay away!).  ",
