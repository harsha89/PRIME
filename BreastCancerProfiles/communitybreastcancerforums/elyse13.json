I was beginning to worry that I wouldn't notice a new lump because I would just assume it was my PASH.  Also, the thought of something growing in there was nerve racking.  My surgery went well.  I have follow up with my surgeon, there were also some other benign tissues so she said I have \"busy breasts\".  I will have some follow up u/s and start mammograms earlier (I am currently 33).",
