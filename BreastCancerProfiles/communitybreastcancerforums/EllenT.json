I was 51 at start of treatment, slender, fit, healthy, with oily Irish skin, and was always told that I looked years younger than my true age. Well, I am comvinced that chemo changed that. The area above my nose looks fine, no brow lines, mild smile crinckles when smiling, but not apparent when my face is at rest.....but, below the nose looks like a different person - I am not happy about this. I had been told that chemo ages one, and also I am on Tamoxifen for almost a year now, four more years of that. I am consulting with a cosmetic surgeon about my options, the same surgeon who will reconstruct my breasts - maybe I can get 2 procedures done at the same time. I don't know what he may recommend. As stated, I am very slim, not much body fat to begin with, but it seems like the chemo just dissolved what facial collagen that I had. Have you found a satisfying solution to this ?",
