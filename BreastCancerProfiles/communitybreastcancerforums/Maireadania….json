But I also use the pool.  I get in hour everyday, do excerises that are arobic and work core muscle group.  The water from the pool works like a full body stocking and working the heart moves the fluid through faster.  It is also great if you suffer any sort of chronic pain.  To really make it fun, I usually meet with a group of ladies in the pool for a hen session while we work out, which has the added benifits of taking care of metal health.  Overall.  My lymphidema is under control, my ankles and calves are smaller than they have been in years.  I feel better and I have way more energy.  So make a Splash ladies, it is worth the pool or gym membership to feel better and look great.",
