      "Content": "Jul 26, 2018 09:42PM - edited Jul 26, 2018 09:47PM by RebkkaJ Hi Everyone, I was DX with Stage IV lung mets both lungs, 2 spots in the brain & positive in the right lymphatic system Mar 1, 2017. ER-,PR+, HER2- Not sure how to post all my treatments like you do in your profile new to the forums but I will hopefully get it figured out along with the etiquette! I started on Abraxane and it was able to keep things at bay for 6 months. When I scanned the cancer had grown Aug 2017. I loved Abraxane I had little side effects and continued to work. Then we switched to Navelbine. It was not too bad I did it every two weeks. I had to take the pro Crit shots weekly my blood counts tanked. I was a little nauseous but controlled it with Zofran and promethazine cream.(love that stuff!) I wasn't on Navelbine very long at my 3mo scan we grew so in Nov we started Adrymiacin. I believe they called it Red Devil. I did a dose dense version every 2 was. This was harder. I went out on STD at work. My doc changed chemos to Doxurubicin Liposomes at 3mos due to toxicity. I finally went LTD at work because it's been going on 18 months now. Things aren't getting easier. I have been so lucky until two weeks ago when he changed me to Ixempra. It's been side effect hell for me. Headaches, nauseous, muscle/bone aches, diarrhea & total exhaustion. Oh and some fun mouth and throat sores! If I eat anything my stomach feels like it's on fire within 15-20min. I cut out anything acidic, spicy or salty! Any advice on what you have experienced to curb some of these would be so greatly appreciated! They did give me a mouthwash to swish & swallow for the sores etc. They recommended Imodium AD. Im going on day 10 I thought surely things would change. This just caught me by surprise! I thought I was tough but this chemo seems to knock me in the dirt! Just a quick background- I'm 48, have 3 sons, married 25yrs this Dec. use to work in the Oil/Gas industry for the last 20yrs. I was Dx with Stage III back in May 2014. Did chemo, full mast., reconstruction was in remission 2yrs 2mos before the Stage IV last Mar. I try hard to stay positive and fight like hell to keep this at bay! Some days just suck but I have many more good than bad. I'm glad I found sisters And brothers fighting who understand the battle. I pray for a cure For each of us! It's been great reading everyone's posts.",
