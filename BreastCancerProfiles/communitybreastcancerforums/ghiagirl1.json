I had a scan 3 weeks ago and I have NED, but my oncologist says I will be on this combo as a FOREVER maintanence because I am a triple neg!! I don't know how I feel about FOREVER. At first I was having a hard time with my blood counts and had 1 platelet transfusion and 2 blood transfusions. But in April I started the Livestrong program through the local Y and my energy has came back and my tumor disappeared!!! I hope you ladies are all doing well:)",
