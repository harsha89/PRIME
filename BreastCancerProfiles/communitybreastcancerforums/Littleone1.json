The bottom of my bra sits on my reduction scars so I'm looking for something that sits under the girls. I am so glad you're finally healed from the surgery! That sounds like it was a difficult time for you. I've only done two out of 20 rads but so far so good. I'm still having phantom pains from the two surgeries, especially around the aerioli from the reduction and the snb incision that I'm not sure if they're bothering me because of the surgeries or radiation. I'm a teacher so the camis probably won't work for that lol. I'm definitely going to look up that website tho! Funny thing is that I don't have a clue what size I am now that I've had the reduction",

I still have them both but stopped wearing them because once you wash them a few times I found that they don't keep their elasticity. I wore them a lot after the surgeries. I did go ahead and order two bras from rawnique so thank you again for that suggestion. I hope they work well! The girls are starting to drop like the surgeon said they would and they look more natural now. One more step to what is going to be the new normal! Thanks again! Susan144, congratulations on the clear lump and nodes and the fur! That's great news! My doctor also said no to the green tea! They said they don't want me to use anything that isn't on their approved list. I am using calendula cream which I chose because it is made for burns. We are on the same schedule. I am having my third treatment today. So far, so good",

Went for my treatment today but spoke to the nurse first bc I am having a sharp burning pain right at the spot of my first surgery (lumpectomy). My RO wanted to look at it, my whole breast is pink and when she felt it thought it was hotter than the other breast. She thinks I have an infection so no treatment for me until the BS clears me. I had that surgery may 30 and the reduction July 6! Could it really be an infection this far out?! I just want to be done! On the upside, my RO did say she reviewed my scans again and has determined that the site is too big for the 4 boosts so it's a total of 16 treatments for me. 4 down, 12 to go after this setback. One day at a time right? Feeling down.",

I have my aveeno eczema and calendula cream ready to go. My SNB site is not happy with the positioning of my arm and I am still somewhat sore and numb from that surgery which was May 30! I certainly hope that pain goes away at some point. Patients at the office were all so nice to me. It was kind of like a club...a radiation club. I was very relieved to see such nice ppl before I went in. Hoping Monday morning goes well. Nervous.",

So back to the BS on Monday and hopefully get cleared to start again at the end of the week. Have to keep this train moving or I'll go a little batty. I also will be taking tamoxifen for 5 years and an AI for another 5 years. I am 49 and premenopausal so I think out age has something to do with it. I've been reading about the side effects...not thrilled. My gyno says that most women tolerate it very well so I'm hoping he's right!",

I am starting radiation on the 14th bc I had a reduction after my lumpectomy. Kind of freaking out because I am a teacher and go back to school on September 5 and radiation won't end until the 11th. The first few days of school are exhausting and I am worried about being fatigued on top of that. I will have 16 whole breast treatments and the 4 boost treatments as well. I feel better reading your post. I am getting tired of constantly being in pain so maybe that will save me the pain of the sunburn type symptoms they're telling me about.",

She did also say that we would see how I'm doing when the time comes as well. When I go in for radiation they always ask me what kind of music I want. I have been asking for hard core butt kicking music (five finger death punch, skillet, etc). He asked why that music bc that's definitely not the norm they get asked for. I said, well I'm kicking cancers ass up in here so I need some ass kicking music to go with it! He laughed. I'm also the sports mom that makes the highlight videos for the football, wrestling and lacrosse teams for the hs so I'm well acquainted with that music. I actually enjoy it now lol. I also visualize the cancer cells shriveling up and dying as I'm getting my radiation...sounds corny I know. On a side note: yes the tattoos hurt but I was very disappointed they made it so boring. I asked for Barbie pink or purple tattoos. Apparently there was no color choice. They take the fun out of everything lol",
