I was too chicken to ask him to just feel my breasts for me, I just thought he would.  I feel like he was just thinking I was overreacting. No explanation, no nothing.  At first, before he was talking to me I was explaining that my nodes have been swollen for a month and he said 'it's probably an infected sweat duct. I knew it wasn't that. He did say 'well, it's not that'.  He also told me that cancerous lumps dont' hurt.  I said 'well, my mom had breast cancer and hers did.'  He acted shocked.  I'm such a moron! Why didn't I just ask him to feel my breasts.  I didnt' expect those lumps are cancer I just wonder what's making my nodes be swolllen!!

Went to the Dr. and had diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.  I was told I have very dense breasts  (also very small) and the Dr. that reads the mammogram said he was 99% sure it was nothing and to come back in a year. I just have fibroadenomas.  This all was in I think Nov-Dec. So now for a little over a month I have been having pains in my left breast.  Some times it's just an ache that is constant and sometimes it's a shooting pain. But the achey pain feels almost like it's bruised and is sore to the touch as well. I do not feel a lump there..just the same lumps on the outer quandrants of the breast towards the armpit.  What I'm concerned about now is last night when I was getting out of the bath I looked in the mirror and at first I thought it was a bruise so I showed my husband and we think it's a vein.  It's blue and over the spot that always hurts.  Is this worth going back to the dr. for after having tests just a few months ago?  Any thoughts?  Thanks Log in to post a reply",
