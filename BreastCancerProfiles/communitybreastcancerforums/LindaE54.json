What you are going through sounds very familiar to a lot us stage IV gals. It's been 2 years and 9 months since I was dx'd. It's a lonely disease and this website has been a lifeline to me. I also had the help of a psychologist which truly was a blessing. As others have said, I'm also on an anti-depressant. It can be trial and error until one finds the right med. But I would definitely not be able to go without it. I encourage you to rant, confide all you want here. It's OK. Nobody gets it like we do. We are all here for you! PM me if you need someone to \"listen\". Sending you love and hugs. Linda",

I've had only one cycle so far. Onc started me on Epirubicin alone but added the other two as TMs were still creeping up. No cystitis yet but like you big time fatigue and bloated all the time. Not sure if it's an SE or ascites. My last scans showed a beginning of ascites, oh joy! I was told to drink 10 glasses of water per day with this chemo to clear kidneys but I find it very hard to do. Ever since I started chemo in May (started with Taxol), I've been having a phenomenal amount of urine especially at night. Both frequency and quantity. I hope this trio will give me a bit more time, nothing's been working in almost a year and TMs keep on creeping up all the time. I will hit 4 years of MBC dx next month, sure miss my ol' letrozole I had for 3 years. I wish us both a good run on this and let's keep in touch.",

Since Ibrance was approved by Health Canada in May, there seems to be different methods of obtaining it, but not always easy. Respective provinces have not approved it yet and do not fund it. It was approved for first line tx for stage IV only. I saw my MO last week who told me Ibrance can be obtained on an exception basis for first line only stage IV. MO's office would make the application to get approval. But if you have personal/employer insurance, that could change the deal. I checked my ex-employer's medical plan yesterday. They listed Ibrance, but my ex-employer will not cover because of the cost. I was told it differs from one ins co to the next and of course from one province to the next. MO said she was confident Ibrance would be approved for second line tx, but it may take a while. Just to confuse you a bit more LOL, my MO is trying to get me on the Palestra trial that Dee/GG27 has been talking about on other threads (protocol is 2 different dosages of Ibrance with a hormone therapy for second line stage IV patients). We may be hitting a hurdle because I was on Tamoxifen for 5 months and Femara since I was dx'd stage IV de novo, and thus can be considered 3rd line. I don't really understand because the literature Dee showed us it is not specific about how many HTs we had. I guess MO is being cautious and doesn't want to waste time if that can be a deal breaker. All this to say, I am so confused! It would be so much simpler if provinces approved it. Hmm, provinces have not even approved Faslodex yet. Although, it doesn't seem to be an issue to get the latter.",

I was told to take pain meds as prescribed to avoid chronic pain. Was also given a blood thinner (injection in tummy) for about a month or so to avoid blood clot. Used a walker for 2 to 3 weeks and then graduated to a cane for a while. It took a good 3 months to heal but was pretty functional.

Carol - I will talk to my Onc about dexamthosone.  I've tried all the OTC anti-inflammatories - maybe it's time for me to move on to a steroid. I asked my nurse on Monday to up my meds but still no response.  I know this is an unacceptable delay, but I am just sick and tired of chasing after her.  The Pope would be easier to reach than her.  I called my pharmacist yesterday - she will try to contact my Onc and get a new med plan in place.  I have to get some QOL back in my life and a 2-3 medicated level would be fine with me.  Depression is setting in and that's not good.  The pain has been slowly increasing over the past 2 months.  Last scans were stable so it's not progression.

Constipation is a major issue for me also on these narcos.  I take Senokot and Colast daily, dried prunes, All Bran and warm prune juice and sometimes suppositories.  I read about the warm prune juice on one of the threads and it really helps.  I also increase my magnesium intake when I'm on those meds.  Walking is very painful and lack of exercise doesn't help.  If one pill of hydrocodone keeps the depression away for you - go for it!  Pain is certainly a depressant and affects every aspect of our life.  Yes, more questions than answers!  I do sometimes get fed up.

I'm told I lost a bit of weight but I don't really feel it, I sure can loose a few. Report says no pleural effusion. I know lung nodules can be benign but weird that they all pop up at the same time. There is some new node involvement as well just like you Faith. And new bone mets on sternum. Anyway, I will just have to wait what MO has to say and hope for the best.

I was wondering how you're doing. Good to know that recent tests are negative and headache is better. You may recall I was having severe headaches. On top of that. right side of tongue is swollen, crooked and partially paralyzed causing speech and swallowing issues. All this started in April. Brain scan was clear but MRI of brain and cervical area revealed some growth on existing bone met on C1 compressing the hypoglossal nerve which controls the tongue. MRI also showed a met on the clivus bone of the skull. The clivus is near the cervical spine where there is a space for intracranial nerves to go through. I'll be getting 5 sessions of rads next week. RO says the hypoglossal is permanently damaged and not to expect improvement. He has heard of very rare cases where it improved but chances are very, very slim. Rads is to avoid further neurological damage. Couldn't have rads earlier because mets to liver were found at the same time and MO wanted a switch to Taxol asap. It appears that even if rads had been done earlier, it wouldn't change the current tongue/speech issues. I didn't know cranial nerve symptoms leads to LMD in some cases. I'll be anxiously waiting to hear your results and hope you get good news. Kaption - great news on lesion reduction! I hate Dex with a passion. Just as I finished weaning I have to get back on it as soon as I start rads. If you find a cure for fatigue, please share with me! Main SE with Taxol is fatigue but I'm pretty sure the recent progression to liver contributes to my fatigue as well.",

      "Content": "LindaE54 wrote: I got the results of my Sept CT & bone scans today. First, my Onc omitted to include the cervical region on last scan request. A scan is ordered within the next 2 weeks. So, on the one hand, I have 5 new very small spine mets in cervical and thoracic regions (only C5-C6 lights up on the bone scan). The thoracic spine mets are stable when compared to May 2015. Note that these lesions were somehow missed somewhere along the way (was first reported on May CT scan as stable! first time I heard about them) The Sept CT and bone scan did pick up the lower region of neck where there is progression of the C5-C6 vs the May scan. No fractures. On the other hand, improvement of iliac met, substantial decrease of axillary lymph node met and pubic bone met shows some healing and consolidation of the pathological fracture. Never thought that would happen and quite happy about that! Other bone mets are stable. Onc's plan is to wait for results of the CT scan of neck to see if C2 is stable or not. If that is stable, Onc wants to stay with Femara because \"stable\" globally (improvement vs progression). If progression of C2, we are thinking of going into the Sandpiper clinical trial (Faslodex + Taselisib or placebo) or with Faslodex alone. This is my first progression since dx in Nov 2013. TMs were within normal range at dx but went down substantially and have been stable. I have mixed feelings - I'd like to stretch Femara for as long as I can. Has anyone had improvement and progression at the same? Did you change tx or not? Note that Ibrance is not approved in Canada so not an option. Any thoughts/opinions are welcome. Linda - dx at 54.

Reports are sometimes confusing for me and different from one Radiologist to another and I've had one particular bad experience in the past who completely misread a test. I managed to get an appt with my Ortho, who BTW, was the one who told me the reading was completely wrong on that particular occasion. He operated me for my femur and I had a few consults with him - he doesn't care about reports at all - he wants to see images and he has always been spot on. So I will see him on 19 Oct and get his opinion. Haven't told my Onc's office about this second opinion (yet?) I think I will be in a better position to discuss tx after this consult. I'd be more than happy to stay on Femara but I won't push my luck too far. Good luck to you and I hope you can stay the course with your current tx and get good results on your next scans.",

Scan in July showed some improvement but will have results of last week's scan today. If there is progression, Epirubicin will be next, if things are stable, I will continue Taxol for 2 or 3 cycles.

Happy for the excellent improvement in your Mom's levels.  I am very much interested to know how it goes.  Invaluable info for me too. Linda",

ShetlandPony gave quite a good explanation on different chemos, thank you SP, very educative for me this morning. MO and I discussed Xeloda but the tumor load in the liver is so severe that she wanted bigger guns for me. MO also felt I no longer respond to hormone therapy. After progression on Femara, I was switched to Faslodex in Feb and that didn't last long. I went from a perfectly healthy liver in Jan 2017 to a liver riddled with mets in May 2017. At this point, we don't know how long I will be on Taxol or what tx would be next. I was scared sh*tless of chemo and always said I would not touch the stuff, but really it's very doable for me. Another thing comes back to mind. MO would request a test for compatibility to Xeloda which would be done in a big Montreal hospital prior to giving me that tx. Plan was/is to scan 3 months after starting Taxol but scenario may be moved up as further testing of TMs continue. I'm really sorry about your sister - it sucks big time. Lots of gals had good success with Taxol for liver mets and I'm hanging on to that for now. I don't know to what extent, if any, the choice of chemo across Canada is cost related but knowing our Quebec system, it is certainly taken into account. Choice of chemo may also be dictated by liver functions and enzymes and other labs that I would not be able to expain. Have you any idea how her liver enzymes are doing? Geez, I'm writing a novel here! Feel free to ask questions on this thread or the Weekly Taxol Stage IV thread. You can also pm me if you want. Babs - You will be on my mind Thursday! Wishing you the same with whatever next tx it will be!",

Exemestane (Aromasin), Arimidex and Femara are all aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and act in a very similar fashion. Other hormone therapy (HT) includes Tamoxifen and Faslodex. All for ER+ and PR+. I'm very surprised that your Onc wants to change your treatment without having imaging that shows progression of the disease. You are right in thinking that when one HT stops working, we go on to another, and sometimes used in combination with targeted therapy such as Ibrance or Afinitor. However, depending on the amount of progression or where it is or tumour load, a chemo is used. Since the first 3 AIs above are very similar, you can't use them one after the other. Perhaps your tumour markers (TMs) are rising and are they reliable for you? TMs are not always an indication of progression. In any event, they should be correlated to scans. Hope this helps and wishing you the best. Keep us posted.",

I would have preferred Xeloda to Taxol but MO felt there was an urgency for the big guns and before taking Xeloda, she'd want a test done to see if I would respond to a 5 FU chemo such as Xeloda. I think it's a blood test if I remember correctly and I don't know how long this testing takes. I had never heard of this until very recently.

Here it goes: Tonsils are in and no seasonal allergies, white counts are fine, some difficulty swallowing when eating, no other muscles playing free games. No rads in that area, vocal chords OK and no throat clearing. Never had chemo and yes mets to almost all cervical area. I had a bone scan this week, but no results yet, however CT scan of brain, neck and chest last week show no change to mets in cervical area. Yep, looked up idiopathic edema, doesn't help. Other than the switch from Femara to Fas, no other change in meds or supplement, no change in products I use nor in food. I spoke with AstraZeneca pharma co today and they have no reports of tongue issues with Fas. Even more mysterious right?!",

Same thing happened to me about 2 years ago, new cervical mets popped up and other mets showed improvement. No tx change for me as I was considered \"overall stable\". Cervical mets have stayed stable since. Take a deep breath, your progression (although unwelcome guest for sure) is not dramatic. What is your MO's plan? I'd be very interested to know.",

Does this sound like progression after 3 months of Taxol? Liver enzymes are back to normal, they were really high. TMs went up for the most part of the 3 months of Taxol (and since Dec 2016 in fact), stabilized about 3 weeks ago and went up by a few points 2 weeks ago. Any similar experiences?

As per his interpretation of imaging, the cervical and thoracic bone mets are stable since Feb of this year with no progression to C5-C6 as opposed to what radiologist said in Sept. The hot spot on the bone scan was a bit bigger but CT scan shows no changes - they are so small that it can be misleading. The other spinal mets do not light up on bone scan. As for the suspected met on T4 - he does not think the lesion is a met (at least for now). So confirmed mets at C2, C5, C6 and T2. We know that those mets were not there at dx, but no CT scan of neck/thoracic/abdomen/pelvis was done between April 2014 to Feb 2015. So no imaging to compare to. The Onc replacing my regular one who was on mat leave during that period of time used US for vital organs and chest X-ray to avoid too much radiation. I will not accept that again and will insist on regular CT and bone scans from now on (because my Onc is pregnant again). Ortho confirms light improvement of iliac met and stability of other mets since dx. X-rays were done today of pubic bone and femur (rod insertion in femur). Orthopedic material is in place and he confirms that pubic bone pathological fracture due to a met is not only partially consolidated (as per Sept scan) but fully consolidated! He says that globally all is well and without asking him, he said he would not change tx now. Those new mets appeared somewhere between April 2014 to Feb 2015, we will never know when, but since they have been stable since Feb of this year, no change is needed. No fractures in spine nor compression. Plus, the axillary lymph node met reduced by 20% since beginning of tx. I feel so much better having had his opinion and will continue with Femara.",

The awful taste in the mouth from thrush combined with loss/change of taste buds with Taxol and nausea is making eating a real ordeal.

It was Taxol for me when liver mets were discovered but I needed the big guns because of the extent of the disease. I did 6 cycles of Taxol, never had a fever, never hospitalized, never had kidney problems etc. They have to list the possible SEs but everyone is different. My SEs were mostly fatigue and gastric issues. Nausea and vomiting are controlled with meds. As for driving, they told me the same as you. I drive myself back and forth, no problem. The pre-meds here include Decadron, Benadryl and something to coat the stomach. I don't know how long you have to drive but I never had problems (30 - 45 min drive). To put your mind at ease, it would be good to have someone accompany you the first time to see how you react to pre-meds. I am switching to Epirubicin next week and I will start a new thread on it. It seems it is more commonly used in Europe and Canada and possibly Australia. I was also told Xeloda will be down the line. You will work out those logistics, it's just too much at once right now for you. I wish I could be of more help.",

Everything was well organized at hospital, my sister came with me for moral support. Got my all favourite Decadron as part of pre-meds (ate everything in sight afterwords), Benadryl and Zantac. I didn't know that Zantac has some anti-allergen properties, we learn something every day. Got 2 rx for nausea if needed, but so far so good. Anita - I know how disappointing it is to see those TMs creep up, but 2 weeks on Xeloda is a very short period of time to draw conclusions. But I get you, we want to see them going down and it plays with our nerves. Hang in there!",

I suppose you have pre-meds such as Dex, Benadryl and something for nausea before starting the chemo drip? I had my 4th Taxol infusion today and had an itchy skin rash pretty much all upper body. They stopped everything, gave all saline and chemo a 15 min break and then resumed. I had a 1/2 worth to go but they doubled the time to one hour for the rest of the infusion and then was smooth sailing from there. Weird thing is same thing happened on infusion number 2 at exactly the same time. We decided that from now on we will administer the chemo over two hours instead of one. There are ways to cope with these reactions such as adjusting the pre-meds or time of infusion, so don't be sad just yet! I'm so happy for you that TMs went down, mine are still creeping up after 1 cycle of Taxol. MO will move up scanning if my TMs don't start behaving.",

Was so depressed at the time that I ate my emotions and still carrying that extra weight. Energy is much less than pre dx, dealing with pain but managing with pain meds which reduce my energy. Minimal SEs from Femara. Aredia monthly, feel crappy for a couple of days then move on. Always loved walking (5-6 kms daily in mountain before dx and other physical activities), now very difficult to walk for long periods of time because of femur and pubic bone met and femoral rod insertion. Had rads several times which helped tremendously. Often wonder about tipping point but try not to dwell on it. I grieved past activities and found new ones. Still enjoying life very much. Stable so far but always worry about progression. Jahaage - Best of luck with your chemo. Confused and sad is normal in our situations.

They gave me local anesthetic and took five samples. Procedure went well, slightly uncomfortable but that's it. Had to lie on my poked side for 2 hours and another 2 hours in bed after that. Take the meds prescribed for when the anesthetic wears off. Like you, I'm not sure what I want this biopsy to show but maybe it will give me answers as to why I don't respond like I should to Taxol. Good luck, I'll be thinking of you!",

We finally found that Zyprexa worked extremely well for nausea and I add Zofran when necessary. I pushed and pushed until I found relief of n/v. Sending you hugs.",

Had 5 rounds of rads, lost my hair from ear level down, had a bad case of oral thrush and mouth sores and a lot of nausea for a good month or so. Tongue swelling went down but the paralysis is still there due to permanent damage to the hypoglossal nerve. The goal was to prevent further neurological damage and so far so good.",
