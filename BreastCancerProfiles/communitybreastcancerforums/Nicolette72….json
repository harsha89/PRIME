Weak and tired I expected but the bone pain was unbearable. I couldn't sleep and nothing seemed to help..the Tylenol suggested did nothing, neither did Vicodin, massage or heat. Online searching for what others have done to get relief saved me. I found several blogs posts etc mentioning claritin and how much it helped so I tried it ..its an allergy medicine and worked wonders for me. I felt the most like ME I had felt in days. It took away most of the bone pain as well as a lot of that flu like feeling chemo gave me. Super grateful for others shared this info online and hope others will find this helpful as well.",
