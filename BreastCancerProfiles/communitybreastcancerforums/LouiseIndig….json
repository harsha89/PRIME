I know i probably should discuss it with the doc but it's fear that keeps putting me off. I suppose i just want to know that it's all a \"normal\" side effect of chemo and rads. I hope your own pain isn't too bad. It's a different reality isn't it, having to adjust to constant pain, and, at least in my case, not wanting to take anything for it as pain killers wreak havoc with my stomach. The joys! Louise",

It means ensuring i eat protein with every meal, which seems to balance my blood sugar. for what it's worth ....... Louise",

At the risk of sounding like a dreaded conspiracy theorist, the bulk of the money for cancer research is coming from the drug companies and hence it is drug oriented along very defined research lines. Believe me, I give thanks every day for the same drugs but also get deeply upset that after all this time and all the money spent that all the same drugs offer us is containment at best -- and more drugs to deal with their side effects. Who knows what would happen if the profit motive were taken out of the drive to a cure? Somehow i think we'd be much nearer the holy grail. Even if just a little more time, effort and money were to be put into disseminating and clinically applying the research that has already proven \"significant\" benefit -- such as exercise -- we could have more empowered survivors out there living longer, healthier, happier, more energised lives. It is back to the question of why a drug that demonstrates \"significant\" benefit will be clinically fostered but much less so a non-drug therapy? Enough of the soap box! Louise",

But why do so many doctors appear to ignore exercise altogether? If a new drug had shown similar \"significant\" benefit in terms of survival, there would be wall to wall coverage on every news media and we'd be demanding access to it. Hope treatment is going well for both of you. I still quite don't believe it refers to me when i write \"bone mets\". This wasn't ever part of the dream of the future.  Louise",

I don't know how widely available it is though -- the treatment centre i attended was spun-off from a previous clinical trial there. If you google it, you will get info on it. Also there's a trial at Tufts in Mass on photodynamic therapy for skin mets, about which i have also heard good reports and as far as i know they are still recruiting. Treatment under the trial is free, you just pay for travel, and a marginal cost for accommodation if you live in the USA. Details on this will also come up if you google. Hope this helps.
