Not aware of any specific gene, but would be really interested if anyone else has.  My treatments are listed in my signature.  The most important thing is that, even after 8 years of treatment, I am still skiing, hiking, traveling, playing hard and having fun even though I have extensive bone and liver mets. I just got back from Machu Picchu and the Gallapagos.  My oncologist works with me to balance keeping the beast under control and keeping me healthy enough to play. Some chemos work for me and others do not.  We give them 3 months and then he scans.  If the beast was not impressed we move on to the next treatment. Even with ILC we will all vary in what we respond to.  Hoping you get lots of time on the anti estrogen strategies and you will see the little one move far into adulthood! Love to you and your family. ",

We had to lower the dose after the first round as my counts were too low. I now get nupogen after every shot and counts are good. I get tired the second week, but rebound on the week off. My CA 29- 27 has dropped from 580 to 132, CEA dropped and CT shows liver tumors much smaller and bone mets stable. I am heavily pre-treated and this is my 8th chemo. So grateful to have this one work. Back to walking, skiing and fun! Wishing you both great results!!!!! ",

It is nice to talk with all of you.  My cancer came back while I was on arimidex after TAC.  Immediately started Abraxane for 6 months, then Navelbine for one month but neuropathy was becoming an issue.  Went on to Gemzar, then aromasin and Afinitor all of which acted like fertizer and tumors in the liver really got out of control...big and too many to count.  Then had a great 12 month run with Xeloda which got rid of most of the tumors and the remaining ones were very small.  Progressed again and now on Havalen which has the tumors back in control and all but one is getting smaller.  My bone mets have not changed since my original metastatic diagnosis three years ago.  Really hoping for a long run on this as I am not sure what is next (the list is getting short).  I am still active, lots of outdoor stuff and busy everyday so I sure hope there are some new drugs coming along.  ",

I did not respond to three chemos in a row and my mets were going crazy especially in my liver. Blood work was not good either and I had to take lots of breaks. I was so discouraged and felt that nothing was going to work. Four months ago I was put on a different chemo and immediately the tumors started to get smaller, bones stopped aching and markers dropped. Blood work is now fairly normal. There are so many chemos out there and each of us responds differently. Hope they can find one that does the trick for you.",
