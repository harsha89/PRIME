And while I've thought about the possible need for getting a second opinion, I'm just realizing, I don't know who to do to for it. What type of doctor should I be looking for to get a second opinion? A radiologist who specializes in breast? An oncologist? I'm not sure. I'm just outside of Philadelphia. If you have any specific recommendations on doctors and/or centers to use, I would love to hear them. I'm also not sure what my best next step would be if the biopsy results find cancer. Is the second opinion the next step or is there more testing first? Any insights would be so appreciated. I'm jumping out of my skin over here every time the phone rings. This is emotionally brutal, and it's just the smallest part of what could be such a long journey. Thanks, Marianne Log in to post a reply",
