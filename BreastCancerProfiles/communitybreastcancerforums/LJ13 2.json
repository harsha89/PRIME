When they removed the nodes, there was nothing left for that vessel to drain into. Now your body has to forge new vessels to drain the arm, axilla, and all the other areas that used to be serviced by those nodes and that dried up vessel. 2 things have helped me. Each night, for months after the node removal, lying in bed I would elevate the affected arm, as if reaching to touch the ceiling. Squeeze your fist about 20 times. Count to 5 for each squeeze, and count to 5 again as you open your fist. Repeat 20 times. Then, use the good hand to rub the arm (held in the same position), from hand to shoulder, as if you are pushing fluid from your hand all the way up your arm to the shoulder. Use firm pressure, but don't squeeze hard. Do that 20-40 times. I would work the inside and outside of the arm separately, alternating. Both of these exercises help your arm develop new drainage routes for lymph fluid.",

It doesn't matter if lymph vessels are thrombosed or dried up ... they aren't being used, they are causing pain, what to do about it? Interesting that you want a study about massage generating growth of lymph vessels. Sorry, I don't know of any. I read that the process may help regrowth. It was on a reputable site about lymphedema. It was logical. I believed it. If you choose not to believe it, that's fine too. I'm pretty sure that gently massaging the arm isn't going to prevent vessel regrowth ... in general stimulation does inspire growth in the body. How would they even DO a study of this? ",
