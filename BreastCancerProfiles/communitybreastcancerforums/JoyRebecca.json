As I recall, the pain eased after 5 or 6 tx's.  3 wks. ago had rads to c spine and t spine, and pain was better after 2 tx's.  I am currently having rads to my sacroiliac area and today is the first day that I'm beginning to feel any relief and that's after 8 tx's. Symtoms were just like BadBoob. Couldn't stand for long, couldn't walk from the parking lot to the store. Today was the first day that I was able to take my dog to the dogwalk without taking Vicoprofen first. I'm so happy! Hang in there...sometimes it just takes more treatments than other times! XX Joy",

I believe liver mets are more incidious and don't give sx until well established, and sometimes, not even then. It's encouraging that you got relief from Tums (even briefly). I agree that with our tx and age stomach stuff does start rearing it's ugly head. LOL \"kitchen challenged\"...I'm one of 'em!! Try a tagamet or prilosec and see if that helps.

I've found my fight but I still haven't found my positive happy self. I'm sure it's soon to follow! You guys are the best. XX Joy BTW...they found the mets accidentally while doing an MRI on l/s spine for pain I've been having in sacral and iliac crest areas.

I've had progression ever since dx and nothing seems to stop it and so just today, I've finished my 2nd round of abraxane/avastin. I know it's supposed to be less harsh than the others, but it really kicked my ass. loaded me up with steroids this time and will start oral ones tomorrow. The 1st dose completely wiped out my white count and getting zometa and neuplasta on the same day was probably not a good idea. Anyhoo, Your positive words following your thoughts(that I share) have really helped me to get my head on straight and think positive. Thank you. Enjoy the hell out of your hugaghan...I'm jealous!! :-) They are made with love to comfort you when life looks shi**y!! As you said \"I am *determined* to respond to treatment and I'm giving this every thing I have, and dammit, I'm determined too. But, yep, those damned thoughts start swirling around....But, I WILL see remission this time, I WILL!!! Again, thanks for helping this sister through a rough nite.

Answer to your question: God DOES hear our prayers. He doesn't wave His magic wand and make things happen the way we want every time, But He does hear and is the ultimate support and will always be there to lift you up if you allow Him to. Why do we have to suffer???...Well, I guess someone has to , and it might as well be us. But when you really think about it, EVERYONE suffers throughout this life. And it's really not a pissin' contest...like \"My suffer is worse than yours.\" I mean, we all have our crosses.  Look at the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan...what they wouldn't give to not taste sand for just 1 day.  Or the mother that loses her baby at birth...what she wouldn't give for just 1 day of sweet baby smells and hugs. Or the person that goes to the store and gets in a fatal wreck...what they would give for just 1 day to make ends right. Or my friend, Mike, 32 yrs old , who came home from work, laid down on the couch and died from a massive heart attack...just 1 more day. The way I choose to look at why I have to go through this is that I am so lucky that I HAVE that 1 more day to do my very best to let the loved ones in my life KNOW how much I love them, and try to be my best so that I can leave this Earth in peace and in the meantime, try to atone for things I wish I would have done differently. I know that you will come to terms, although what a hard road that is. I know you will do it because of your children...because they will live your legacy. You'll work through this and come to peace with yourself and your God. In the meantime, I'll be thinking of you, and praying for you, and be here when you falter. XX Joy",

It was my back pain but 100 times worse. I went to my chiropractor and it kept getting worse, so finally ended up with my MD, who referred me to Ortho. Ended up being stage IV mets to vertebrae.

I opted for Tamox,Zometa, and rads as opposed to chemo and bilat mastectomies on the advice of my onc. He said if this doesn't stop progression then we can talk about chemo later. Now my markers are up and I don't know how much is a significant rise? I'm doubting if I made the right decision for tx. Or maybe I'm too new at this to be able to control the panic!?
