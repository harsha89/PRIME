I am facing a double mastectomy, lymph node dissection and port placement this coming Thursday the 29th of July. I have also chosen to do reconstruction at the same time. I am totally fricking out and can not sleep well. I have a loving husband and two young girls who don't understand what is going on with me. Can anyone out there give me some help so this won't be so scary for me. The thought of losing both breast, and hair is to much to take.... I cry a lot !!!!! So, any advice is surely welcomed.
