I have noticed some softening, but the vein thing really bugs me so hopefully doing the additional massage you suggested will help.

I am having rads for 5 weeks plus 8 boosts. I am barely an A cup on the cancer side and I am worried I will have no breast left after rads.....did rads effect you cosmeticly? You're right.......this all sucks!!!! BTW- My breast surgeon is a man!",

Since I had small breasts from the get go I always wore padded bras and that is basicly what is \"seen\" through clothes. I have worn an underwire since without problem. Prior to bc I had planned on getting a breast enlargement. I was a nice full B cup when I was pregnant and that is what I want to be all the time. Would I need to see a specialist PS for that or is that something any PS can do? Boobytrapped (love the name!)- I haven't experienced any numbness at lumpectomy site or at SNB site. I'm sorry that is happening for you. Is it possible it may correct with time? Christina ",
