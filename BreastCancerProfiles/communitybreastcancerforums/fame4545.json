I had 2 surgeries lumpectomy and masectomy. I just finished my 6 treatments of chemo and still have 8 more months to go for the Herciptin. I had 18 lymph nodes removed and 1 node under my arm was positive. I have met a lot of breast cancer patient but none what I have. I was so scared for my life. My Onc. didn't mention Neratinib drugs. I will ask, in my next visit. I was told that with out this Herciptin drugs with my prognosis, I have 3 months to live. I give a lot of credits to the researcher for their hard work. Good luck Elaine",
