Hope is a great thing. Thanks for your positivity and advice, I will find an advocate! Ill let you know what 2nd opinion says. BKj66 Thanks for your reply, Im sorry to hear you have been diagnosed again, it took my mum to have it twice then me to get it for them to even suggest a BRAC test (same shoddy oncologist), so Im glad I now know I have it and I hope you have some sense of empowerment knowing why this has happened to you, I agree neo chemo is the best and it has worked so well for me and often does for triple negatives I hear. They did tell me that I had that liver dot at the beginning but they told me it was nothing ( also had liver ultrasound a week after CT which was clear), its only that it has gone since chemo that she is now saying it was a met but still not conclusive and as Linda says Ill never now as its now gone so it cant be biopsied. Take care and all the best with your treatment. PS my mums had it twice shes a 20 yr survivor and nearly 60.  Esme x",

I said Im glad your so confident Im gonna get mets you dont mind risking a slap round the face. Yes a real brazen twit and she has taken away my hope at aged 31but Im getting it back again now, she should have been congratulating my complete response and clear scans, thanks ladies .",

I went to see a private top oncologist , she said she thinks if I had liver mets it Wud have shown on the ultrasound and even if it was mets I cud still b cured , she is gonna get a 2nd opinion to look at the scans from last year but it's likely we will never know If it were mets or not , she gave me alot of hope and said the main thing is that I had a complete response and therefore regardless of wot category I'm in I have done the best I cud have done. She recommends MRI scan for 1-2 yrs then mastectomies , she said no rush for Dble mastectomy wait a year or two , she said as far as she is concerned I'm not stage 4 Thnx for your support x",

      "Content": "EshLou wrote: Hello everyone, I was diagnosed in November 2010 with grade 3 IDC with significant lymph node involvement to armpit and collarbone reaching the base of my neck, they started me on neo chemo straight away FEC x 3 /Taxotere x 3 then the usual scans, I then had a lumpectomy and have just strated radio to breast/armpit and collarbone/neck area. The good news is I have had a complete path response to chemo and my pathology report following surgery was that there was no remaining cancer in breast or lymph nodes in armpit, no microscopic cells found out of 5 nodes and breast tissue. I have spent the last 3 weeks celebrating and feeling that I can finally start moving on, the breast surgeon was very positive about my future. I am BRAC1 and have said I want a double mastectomy in 6 months time. I went to see my oncologist yesterday who said that on my first CT scan there was what they called a small lesion (which they said not to be concerned about as it could be a bit of fat or blood vessel), since that time this has disapeared and she is now saying that it is highly probable that this was a very small met in my liver; she is now saying that despite my complete pathological response to chemo that I am now very high risk and it is \"very likely\" the cancer will recur within 2 yrs as i have \"controlled secondary disease\".  She told me she is recommending I dont have the double mastectomy as despite me being BRAC1 I should just go and have some quality time and worry more about metastatic disease than removal of my breasts. The nurse specialist and breast surgeon do not agree and state the spot on my liver is not conclusive and I am now seeking a 2nd opinion privately. They are all saying I am a unique case and none of them really know what my prognosis is, I asked her if this changed my stage to 4 instaed of 3 but she changed the subject. I am so confused, worried and feel isolated as they say I am a unique case, I am 31, triple negative and have genetic breast cancer and now my anxiety has been raised about mets to my liver 5 months after diagnosis, all beit they all agree I am in remission at the moment, does anyone have any views/advice or experience? Thank you and love to you all Dx 11/15/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
