And even as comfortable as they are, I can't wear them more than 10 hours at a time.  I have to take them off.  I normally come in at night and take off my garments and elevate my arm. Good luck to you - I'm so sorry - I hate having to jump through hoops trying to figure out what works best for my arm.",

I'm so tired of feeling the way I'm feeling. I'm sad so much, and I'm a faker so much...nobody but my husband really knows what's going on and I don't show him all of it - he would run screaming for the hills if he knew how f#$#ed up I really am.   But I feel like taking a pill is not going to solve anything...it seems to me that I just need to give myself time.  So in the meantime, I just go around telling everyone I'm fine and life's wonderful, blah blah blah.  It was really, really nice to go in there to the therapist's office and show her all the snakes in my head, and I she didn't want to have me committed - she let me leave.  Yay!!!!  I'm looking for your experiences with this - what do you think?  Love you guys, Suzanne Dx 1/27/2010, ILC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/10 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

I use a skin barrier from Smith and Nephew that's really good - here's the link for the product on bandages plus's website: http://www.bandagesplus.com/prd/100/938/Skin-Prep-Spray-4oz.html  I have the spray, but prefer the wipes.  I buy them off of amazon.  They work great for kinesio tape.

What online vendors do you guys use?  I have no place locally to shop and will have to drive two hours to Memphis.  I'd rather just do it online.  Any recommendations would be appreciated!",

I don't have a lot of patience with the 'this is hard on me' attitude (edited to say I mean my DH whining that LE is hard on him-and to his credit, he never has).  I try extra hard not to be a cry baby about le, but when I need help, I need help, dammit.  And that's just what marriage is about.  If my husband isn't on board with that he can hit the road. Steffief, so sorry you are struggling...it's hard getting used to dressing with LE/no boobs I can tell you.  I am even going to the beach next week and will be wearing a swimsuit with no foobs - I'll be totally flat.  I will probably NOT wear my compression sleeve while I'm on the beach, but will definitely coat myself in sunscreen.  And I'm really looking forward to the trip, but have been a bit nervous about the swimsuit aspect.  Yes, I will look wierd, but big deal.  Have you seen some of the freakshows at the beach????  So I should fit right in.  Hang in there - some days I do great with it and sometimes I don't...thank goodness for this site.",

It sounds like your PS wants you to wear the bra for support, yes?  I know there are some really good camis out there that the women who have truncal LE wear - I'm sure someone will chime in soon with a good answer.  And I understand totally about wanting to punch people who say that...they just don't understand how crappy our options are, do they?",

I'm so sorry you are struggling with this.  Cancer is a b#tch and even when we think we've caught it early, it can still bite us in the !#@#.  I hate it.  I hate what it's done to me and to all of us.

I think I just had to be sad and angry for a little while...and I don't make good decisions when I'm upset. I use lymphedivas sleeves...they are funky and colorful, and if I have to wear this crap, it needs to be fashionable, you know???   My LE therapist has taught me some MLD and kinesio tape really seems to help me as well.  I also have an exercise dvd that was recommended by a lovely lady on this site - it's called the Lebed Method and it's for LE patients. The biggest help to me has been my flexi-touch machine.  It has really helped me tremendously.  I use it every day - it takes an hour, but it's so worth it. When I first got diagnosed, I immediately went to amazon.com to get some books on LE - there is basically nothing.  I got two books that were both mediocre, and that's IT.  This site has been by far a bigger help to me.

Besides wrapping, working with an le therapist (a good one) and getting exercise, there are other things that really help me as well - nuerontin (prescription), volteran creme (prescription) in the summer, Solaris Tribute nightsleeve, flexitouch machine, wrapping...and I have to mix it all up.  It seems like my le gets conditioned to a certain program and then I have to shake things up again, either with changing up how I do stuff and when, or going to see my therapist for some intensive MLD sessions. By intensive, I mean she does it for 30 min. or so - I am horrible at MLD. Hang in there - I try not to get too down about LE.  Everybody has something they have to deal with...some folks (and some of them are on this forum) have multiple issues that they deal with and do it with such grace!  I try not to let le get in the way of what I want to do.  If I want to hoe the garden or weed, or cook a bunch of stuff, I just have to make sure I'm smart about it - and that I drink lots of water and don't overdo.  Same goes for exercise - I walk in the a.m. before it gets so hot, or I bundle up and make sure my arm doesn't get too cold.  And the wierdest thing is, when I don't get enough sleep my arm freaks out -  I am prone to insomnia and if I get less than 5 hours of sleep, I am guaranteed to have a tough le day the next day. Whatever.  LE is so stupid.  That's my official opinion on it.    Hang in there!!!!",

Sarah, my surgeon told me not to worry about flying with a compression sleeve.  I didn't need it because I didn't have lymphedema.  Wrong.    I did some reading and decided to get one 'just in case'.   One of the nurses in my onco's. office told me that nobody gets lymphedema anymore...it's a thing of the past. Again, wrong.  40% of women who have as many nodes removed as I did get it.  I went to an LE therapist and found out the reason why my arm had been feeling tingly and achy was that I had lymphedema.  I was crushed.  Thankfully, I'm getting some help with my arm and it's doing better. I would get angry about your post, but I know where you're coming from.  Before I got lymphedema, I would have probably felt the same way, and shame on me.  Now I know better.  Misinformation about how to grow violets or how to re-tile your tub can cause frustration, but it doesn't impair someone's life forever.  Misinformation about lymphedema can forever change the way a breast cancer survivor lives the rest of their life.  Personally, if one woman can avoid this because I'm being mean-spirited and cranky, then good for me. I don't see where you get the 'tempest in a teapot' viewpoint, but if you had to live with lymphedema 24/7 you'd probably sound cranky, too.  Until you have slept in bandages, worn compression sleeves and gauntlets in 90 degree heat, and had to ditch your favorite jacket because you can''t get your big, sausage-like arm through the sleeve and you wear a dress size 8, you should not be on here throwing stones.   I am 40 years old - I used to run 30 miles a week - ran around my house like I was on speed - gardened, cooked...I mean, I did it all.  I can still do those things...but instead of hoeing my garden for an hour or two, I can do 15 to 20 minutes.  Then I have to stop and go inside and rest like an old lady.  The first time I realized that this was for life, as Kane describes, I cried.  Then I got up off my pity pot and decided to be grateful that I'm alive, still here, and even though I'm severely altered because of cancer, I got another chance..and alot of folks don't get that. And my lymphedema is probably nobody's fault.  But I KNOW there's not enough good info. on this condition out there.  And if YOU get something out of this thread and can avoid this stuff, I will be so happy.  I don't want anyone to have to live with this if they don't have to. Peace to you, and to all of my swollen sisters who have to live with this every day. ",

I was so emotional this a.m. and then realized when I got to work that it's been 6 months to the day since my bmx.   I don't look or feel like I thought I would at 41, but it beats the heck out of the alternative.  Even with the stupid LE, you are so right - we are still here!!!!! Had a call from a lovely family member (3rd cousin) today who had heard that I had leukemia (from the cousin who asked me why I'd gotten the mastectomy:  rocket scientist, no.) Suddenly, I was much more grateful to have lymphedema!!!!!!  Amazing what a little change in perspective can do...",

As far as flare control goes, I have just found out (being a newbie and all) that wearing compression bandaging for 36 straight hours is the most EFFECTIVE thing I've tried yet.  I've never been bandaged that long and it worked like a dream.  I was pain free and soooo comfortable for nearly 24 hours.  My arm has started swelling again a wee bit, but I'll bandage again and all will be well.  I've also got a night sleeve coming - that should help when I don't want to wrap. Other than that, drinking TONS of water seems to help a lot, as well as a healthy diet and light exercise...but it's very light when I'm flaring.  I also find that brownies are a big help to me. ",

I called my onco. and talked to a lovely, lovely nurse about pain meds and counseling.  I started taking something that wouldn't turn me into a 'dope fiend', as my grandmother would have said, and I started talking to a wonderful counselor about all of the crap that I was dealing with.  Kira said it so well....all of it is just too much.  And when you throw in being in constant pain, it just begins to wear you down.   The good news is that I am in a much better place now.  I'm happy, and enjoying life for the first time in a long time.  I don't feel like a freak, even with my scars and my big, puffy arm.  I think I'm pretty darn cute.  The bad news is that I have lost all modesty and would probably show my dentist my chest scars if he really wanted to see them.    It gets better.  It's such a biotch, but it does eventually get better.   Please hang in there and know that as miserable as you are right now, it won't be this way forever.  The women on this forum have been such a huge help to me...I am praying for you and sending good thoughts to you. Edited to add:  I got okay with my physical self when I realized that the SOBS who think I'm unattractive now wouldn't have liked me when I still had breasts.  And if my having boobs is the difference between someone thinking I'm attractive or not, then screw them.  I am sorry to be so hateful, but that's just how I feel.  I have no idea what you look like physically, Schoolmarm, but I read your post, and I know that you are a beautiful, sensitive soul that any man with any damn sense should be thrilled to get to spend time with. Also, I'm very sorry for the swearing.  Blame tamoxifen.  I'm nuts this week.",

Seriously love you guys.  Thank you. Suzanne",

I have also thought about all the stupid lean cuisines I ate all those years...did that cause my cancer?  Did the stress?  Did the perfume and the water bottles that got hot in my car, and did I cause my lymphedema by opting for the bmx?  Should I have done something different?  Did I do to much after surgery and cause it?  Did I...blah blah blah blah blah.  I can play this game until I'm literally a total bundle of nerves, anxiety, and regret.  Not healthy at all. You get the picture.  I just can't look back.  It's done.  It's over, and it is what it is.  I am trying really hard NOT TO LOOK BACK.  There's a plaque hanging in my kitchen that says, \"The time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here.\"  I love that. I love what Jan said...\"I wish us all well.\"  I second that emotion.  If I could give us all a big fat break, I would do it in a heartbeat.  Sending hugs and prayers to you guys!!!!",

In the a.m. after my shower, I do MLD.  I focus on neck, left shoulder, right rib cage, right arm.  I have LE in my right arm and right trunk.  At night, I use my flexitouch machine after I do some MLD to my neck.  After an hour on the machine, I wrap my arm. I also have to drink tons of water, too.  Walking helps as well.   I don't think people have any idea how much time treating LE takes...it's a commitment, for sure.  But now it's kind of like brushing my teeth...I just do it.",

The heat has broken here, and I'm really hoping that helps alleviate some of the issues I've been having.  Kira, please give us an update when you have time of everything you guys learned.  Thanks again - you are a total SWEET PEA.   S.",

Good luck with your surgery and thanks again!",
