Maybe with time I will come around, I'm just nervous about getting heart damage or cancer from rads down the road. Apparently neither shows up right away, so it's almost like another unknown looming in the future.",

My mastectomy was due to a local recurrence after lumpectomy (with good margins -my closest was 1.3 cm) and neoadjuvent chemo. 17 months post tx I found a lump under scar and recurrence was confirmed. It was thought that there was skin and muscle invasion from MRI but I was grateful to learn that although close it had not invaded. 4mm was my closest margin to muscle. Because I already did radiation and my margin is considered \"good\" I can not have radiation again, although my RO said that had it invaded muscle or skin, he would radiate again. I am now doing 6 tx of cisplatin and Gemcitabine - praying this gets rid of every microscopic cell there is especially since I achieved PCR the first time! My MO says it is extremely rare to have a local recurrence after PCR but unfortunately it can happen. I think it depends on your pathology and how aggressive it is. I have a very aggressive tumour and decided very early on that if I didn't do absolutely everything to get rid of this I could never live with the \"what ifs\". I did high dose chemo (vs. dose dense) had very good margins from LX and did 33 radiation tx to whole breast, axilla and supraclavicular and yet it came back. I'm at peace knowing I've done everything but you have to weigh your own circumstances. Best wishes in your decision.",

It was a hard decision and pathology showed they were normal but I don't regret my decision. It was troublesome not knowing if my ovaries were working against me and my Dr. Explained that the only way to be 100% sure was to have them out.

Mine was white and baby fine. As time went on (seemed like forever) more colour came back with slightly thicker hair. My hair seems to have really slowed in growing, but I just found out I'm hypothyroid so I'm hoping this is just a symptom and once my meds kick in maybe my hair will resume growing. If not, at least there is enough to go wigless and in the scheme of things, it's a small price to pay for being alive ;-) Your pic definitely shows progress!",

Ladies, your hair will grow but I do know how the impatience makes you feel. I felt the same way, but when I started rads I decided to ditch the wig and own my baldness. Today I'm loving my new hair. I no longer am a slave to hair dye and really like the colour that I've ended up with-though I loved the salt/pepper I had around Xmas. More and more colour is coming back so I'm no longer gray. I've also decided to keep my hair short-which was a huge change for me as I always had longer hair. It's so nice not to have to spend so much time drying-straightening! ",

I asked my surgeon beforehand for something to calm me because I tend to work myself up with this type of procedure.she gave it to me no problem and after hearing I wouldn't be getting the lidocaine (which made sense) I put the Ativan under my tongue and was allowed to wait a few minutes. It kicked in quickly and by the time I had the injections (which my husband could not watch) I didn't care! I didn't perceive pain and was very comfortable in my zen euphoria! I don't understand why Ativan isn't used more to make the numerous uncomfortable/painful procedures more humane. Please ask your surgeons about this if you are scheduled to have this done before surgery",

I had below shoulder length hair, and had a friend shave it to about an inch right after my first chemo-I wanted to be in control as to my hair loss, not cancer! This gave me strength and a feeling of control that I felt I lost after dx. When my scalp started hurting and I began to loose hair, I would vacuum my head!!

I had gone I to a salon at my local mall and the owner came right over to help me with all the products. I was a bit embarrassed with the lack of hair and explained that my current state was the start of my recovery from chemo. He asked if I had a few minutes he could \"shape\" my hair for me. Well after not sitting in a hairdressers chair for what seemed like years, I jumped at the chance to feel fussed over and figured he couldn't make it any worse! Well he trimmed the ends and showed me how to use the gel to slick the sides and bring out my cheekbones and then tossled dry the top. Best part was when I went to pay-he said that it was his pleasure and didn't charge me! I gave him a hug and proudly walked out of his salon feeling like a stylish woman. Needless to say, he's my hairdresser now (even though I've only had 2 trims since then ). Hope everyone had a wonderful New Years! I would like to thank Deen for starting this thread, I'm always comming back here to catch up and I think that's because it's such a positive thread and seems to be the first big step all of us take AWAY from the treatment and start living our lives a little bit more normally ;-)",

This is a safe place where we don't have to worry about protecting those close to us with the sometimes scary, emotional realities. Good for you going commando! It is liberating isn't it? I'll never forget the day I decided to not wear my wig. I was going through radiation (during the hot summer) and decided going topless (lol) to the hospital felt like a safe first outing. So there I am walking down a very long hallway towards radiation, feeling a little self conscious and a woman walking towards me slows and says \"you look beautiful\" you cannot imagine how much I appreciated that act of kindness. I felt confident after that and never wore my wig again! I'm still looking for the right opportunity to 'pay it forward'",

I'm sorry that you find yourself joining our group but you have found a source of really great support! Everyone here is supportive, caring and knowledgeable. I'm also sorry about your Mom. I watched my Mom fight breast cancer and ultimately loose after 2 years when I was 15, so I know how that can leave fear in you. I'm here to tell you that chemo is very doable. It isn't a walk in the park, but it's not horrible either! They have so many good drugs to counteract all the side effects. My oncologist told me the first time (this is my second time doing chemo) that if I felt at all nauseated that I should phone right away because that meant she wasn't doing her job! That made me feel so much better- I was never sick (except when my steroid increased appetite made me eat way too many garlic shrimp! Lol) . I never threw up just felt queazy. I know the trick is to take your meds even if your feeling alright- stay on top of it, don't let yourself start to feel nauseous, take your RX. Please don't let fear of treatment hinder your fight- I know you can do this! Remember things have changed a lot and we are surviving! It's normal to be apprehensive so I think of chemo as my friend! I imagine each drip a hungry 'pac man' orb entering my body and eating up all the cancer! Hugs hon, your with friends here and we will support you through! Shari  ",

I just had my teeth cleaned yesterday and my hygienist said that they recommend biotin mouth wash more to keep your mouth moist as chemo can be very drying. This should help as a dry mouth can increase your chance of cavities.

I'm feeling very apprehensive about this appointment, as if the axe is going to fall again. Finding out that I have metaplastic has really been hard to accept. I hope she can give me some hope. I'm suppose to sign consent forms and get my picc line inserted tomorrow and get my first chemo. Thinking of everyone- minimal SE to all! Shari   ",

I just don't understand how a chemo used for metastatic cancer to maintain progression will be enough to put me in NED. Plus my MO said there is no way of knowing if it is working. I apologize, I'm just feeling defeated which is really not my normal disposition. Plus I'm getting a sore throat tonight! My luck I won't get chemo tomorrow! Time I put myself to bed!

I try not to think about getting things in order, but honestly I do. I've read that a second diagnosis is much harder to take, so maybe this is what we are feeling and dealing with? I have to wonder if it is a way of coming to terms with mortality- not that an end is anytime soon, but having cancer makes us more aware that life doesn't go on forever.

When making my DH lunch, I suddenly realized I was standing straight! Bending down has been improving steadily so I can slowly pick things up from the floor (amazing how many things you drop!)

However this isn't my main concern right now, I just want to beat this! I would highly recommend diep, just as long as you accept that recovery is long and sometimes frustrating. Your breast is warm and soft just like a natural. I will need revisional to reduce and lift my other- just hoping I make it there.

My last docetaxel infusion, I thought about trying a heating pad on my thighs and surprisingly it helped, if you find you get bone pain, maybe try this. Hugs to all Shari",

Glad your MO is ordering an MRI- better to be proactive and hopefully find out what's going on. I hope you get relief soon! What absolutely beautiful grand kids!   Alibeths didn't your RO tell you what lotions to use? Each one seems to have their preferred ones. I went against my RO and used emu oil. There were a lot of women using it on the summer 2013 rads thread with really good response. My skin held up so well that the techs kept asking what I was using and when I told them emu oil, I got scolded. I continued and at last boost only had a couple pin head blisters. I believe emu oil may be considered an antioxidant which I recently found out which may be why some ROs frown on but I've also recently read that a lot are now recommending it because it works so well, so buyer beware! I also got a frogg togg chilling towel and laid it on my chest for the 2 hour drive home. You can get them on Amazon. Hope this helps a biy",

I'm finding comfort in knowing she is being very proactive.  Wow that's my favourite pirate! I'll take a bath with him and rum lol! Littleblue, I'm happy you finally connected with your RO good your getting your sim- are you getting tattoos? If so, make sure you know where they are putting them, I have one that is very large and visible between my breasts and looks like a big blackhead- yuck!  It's a constant reminder as it shows in V- necks  Lovlilynne, I'm sorry about your neuropathy.

I think you should then add one of those \"pellets\" you can get at the dollar store that adds all the colors to campfires so you can celebrate being done and add a \"positive\" karma!

Dizz, so sorry about the shingles, my daughter went through that in her mid 20's- it's an awful affliction. I'm going to see about getting the vaccine at my yearly physical. I hear you about the aches and pains. I've had hip and knee problems and now my shoulder. Thankfully prednisone injections have really helped. I havnt been on the boards as often as I just needed to start living. I've been really trying to be more active and feel a lot better. I know it's not a huge amount but I try to walk two miles every day but take a day or two off every now and then. It's helped me feel better physically and emotionally. When I had the recurrence and had a mastectomy I never read my pathology, guess I needed time to accept everything and my MO told me that they got everything. Well I finally read it and was shocked to find that they found grade 3 DCIS in the same breast. I immediately made an appointment with my BS who said that it didn't put me at any higher risk but I'm not feeling great about it. I had whole breast radiation and yet dcis was found? I've tried to get yearly MRI 's but they won't do it (live in Canada) as they said the newest studies indicate it doesn't increase chance of survival. So I'm trying to get on with my life with a better attitude. Ive finished my diep reconstruction (feb) and am thrilled with the results, although I'm getting use to smaller breasts and how they look in all my old clothing! I get my 3D nipple tattoos in July and then I'm done! Well I wish everyone good health and peace of heart and mind. Our lives are forever changed and we all understand how a new ache can bring panic when others have no idea how that affects us. Living life unaffected without worry seems like such a huge gift that most of us took for granted. The challenge now is not to let cancer rule us- I'm learning. Hugs everyone, Shari",

I also had a wig fom Renee that I wore and was pleased with it, although the hair around the nape of the neck matted quite a bit, may have something to do with having to wear it in the winter and was probably rubbing on my coat.",

ThePrincess, that is a good explanation for all the sore throats, thank you for explaining this because I've had a sore throat and was scared I was getting sick. KBee you are amazing! I wish I had the energy to walk a mile but I find I'm not as strong as before surgery. I had to laugh when you said you bought big tea bags for sun tea (we call it ice tea- I think that's the same?) because I bought all these expensive herbal teas to enjoy through chemo only to have been told that I can't drink any of them as they all contain antioxidants! Now I remember being told to stay away from green tea the first time because it's packed with antioxidants, but I thought ginger tea, orange tea etc would be ok. Oh well I guess it will stay in the pantry. To all those suffering with UTI, I hope the non burning, free flow returns! I'll have to drink some more today- I hate UTI's. Just a little heads up, two years ago a woman in my chemo month took drinking 'lots of water' to a new level and actually drank too much water and flushed all the electrolytes out and was hospitalized! . I drink soda stream water (no salt) and add a little sugar free Gatorade to it on my 'heavy drinking chemo' days, to hopefully keep everything more in balance.

She said that sometimes all the steroids I was on can cause this- that it may be temporary or permanent! She is giving me two months and will retest so I'm trying real hard to walk a mile a day despite my aching joints/muscles and am following a low carb diet. I've lost 7 of the 20 pounds I put on with chemo. I'm telling you this because for me it explains getting up every 2-3 hours to pee. I thought it was all the water I was drinking during chemo but I finished that 6 weeks ago. I'm not sure why glucose was never tested while on chemo and I had no idea steroids can cause this. I would ask for a glucose test next time just to rule out. I don't think it's that common because I've never heard of anyone getting diabetes from steroids but I guess it happens.",

Then I whacked my foot and lost toenail #2,that definitely made me cry! I almost felt PMS/hormonal, but I haven't had a period since first chemo 6 months ago. I just realized that I'm allowed to feel down once in awhile, so I took a pain med (toe) and went to bed really early. I was fine the next day. I would definitely ask your RO about lump in throat. I noticed this also by my 3rd tx, was assured by techs that my throat was not in the field but had me see RO anyway. He confirmed that rads was causing it, but that most women feel a sore throat more than a lump. He said sometimes a hoarse voice will also present itself and this is all caused by \"irritation and should go away\". I still feel the lump at tx 9, and will mention it again when I see him fri. Hoping you can start swimming, but don't push yourself too much, you've been through a lot.",

I found it quite good and informative. There were about 8 of us. We were given a booklet which covers all the information that the nurse covered in the presentation. I did ask lots of questions and each one was answered to my satisfaction. One thing I was a little surprised at was that a compression sleeve was recommended to be worn whenever you were active. I thought I would only need it if I noticed symptoms. Also it was recommended to see a therapist 1-2 times a month for massage (and yet it is not covered by OHIP and very few private insurance will cover the cost). It seems insane that a condition that is caused by \"treatment\" is not covered fully by some kind of insurance to treat. I believe I will be measured for a sleeve but will let you know!",

I found the FEC part quite easy, although it did give me chemo brain and I felt \"cloudy\" for a few days after. Rx kept nausea away and I was able to take 3 days off work each tx, so I slept quite a bit. Eat whatever appeals to you. A lot of women find white foods were craved-mashed potatoes, rice etc. I was the opposite and really craved spicy foods. I'm guessing just so I could  taste something. My taste buds gradually returned by the third week, just in time for next tx! Make sure you swish your mouth with warm water, salt and baking soda every time you think of it, this will help with mouth sores.

Anastasia also makes a felt pen that was helpful in drawing hairs on top of the powder. Just to let you know, the powder does stay on quite well, I think it must have some wax in it.

Basically all she had to say was that because of the way my disease had presented itself (very agressive-grew 1cm in a month) that my team decided that they would treat me with the most agressive treatments to give me the best chance of Ned. She said this included rads, but that the final decision of how much they will radiate would be made after surgery. I really didn't want to hear this, but needed to. It has brought a scary reality to me, I think because I feel so good, that maybe I've been in a bit of denial at how serious TN is. So...instead of fearing radiation, I will welcome having the big guns on my side! I will have another apt. With my RO to discuss my specific concerns, so I'm feeling better about everything.

I then asked if my thyroid was bing exposed and he said no, that it was higher than where I felt the lump. I asked if they test the thyroid after rads and he said not typically-I will defiantly request this when I'm done. So I would ask your RO or at least mention it to the techs in case they want to check it out",

I got my emu oil from amazon, as several ladies recommended the thunder ridge (blue bottle) brand. I also got the 4oz size and it seems to be the perfect size for 33 tx with some left over. The odd time I used over the counter hydrocortisone cream to releave some itchiness. I found that I have a circular area in underarm that became a dark brown colour and is now peeling and somewhat \"tight\" feeling in certain positions. Again, this really doesn't bother me at all. My nipple has been consistently angry red from the beginning, sensitive to certain fabrics but tolerable. I had my last review with RO and she warned me that after completion my skin would become worse for about 2 weeks. I'm happy she told me what to expect, but I plan to sail through this part as well :) I asked her if the \"lump feeling\" in my throat would go away and she said it should..... So asked her to check thyroid. It is on low side of normal, so I'm hoping this SE leaves after I'm done! Hope everyone is enjoying week end and break from zaps! I should say that the techs didn't want me using emu oil also and their fear was that it may have ani oxidants in it that could counter radiation, so please keep this in mind if your naughty and go against RO! 29/33",

I totally agree that what I'm feeling is rad related. The techs dismissed my symptoms and added that if it was related it wouldn't show up so soon! I then retorted that maybe I was more sensitive to radiation than the average. I know they mean well, and maybe it's nothing or maybe it's because I hate the whole thought of radiation with all the possible SE. I'm really doing this against my will but realize that if C ever came back, I would regret not doing rads. I wish there was a healthier way of treating breast cancer!",

Let them know how you are feeling, your meds may need to be adjusted. My oncologist told me that if I was feeling nauseated I should call because that meant she wasn't doing her job! I was on a different chemo than you and I know we all react differently, but please let them know how miserable you are feeling. Make sure you take your meds as prescribed and don't miss any even if you feel better as it is much harder to control the nauseated feeling once it starts- stay ahead of it. Make sure you are drinking lots of water- you need to flush your kidneys. I found plain water very hard to stay down and switched to soda water ( we got a soda stream) which was great for me. I also did neoadjuvent and am so glad I gave it all I could, I am gratefully almost 2 years NED (if you go by dx date)",

The techs were so impressed with how my skin was holding out they kept asking what I was using. I finally told them and got scolded! I use to put it on right after tax, then a couple times after- always before bed. For me, it really worked, but be advised that the anti oxidant quality may negate the radiation. In hind site I would research more before using and ask if it would interfere with radiation. I would think radiation goes through just about anything.",

I'm going to have it checked out in June when I see my MO, but I'm due for my first mammo since surgery- will this make it worse? I'm already worried about the pain as just pressing on the area hurts. I can't imagine putting my sore breast between those plates! Knowing that blood pressure cuffs are a no-no for affected arms, I can't help worrying about what a mammogram would do to an affected breast?",

I had been using moisturizing drops for the longest time and it did make my eyes feel better, but still bloodshot. Last week I started to experience slight itching so I went to my PCP. She examined me and gave me an RX for apo-olopatadine drops to use as she thinks it's eye allergies. I have used the drops for 4 days now and the itching stopped and my eyes are much less red. I'll have to see if this is the solution but at least they aren't itchy or as red. I hope you find some solution as I know how unsettling it is to look in the mirror and look stoned all the time!",
