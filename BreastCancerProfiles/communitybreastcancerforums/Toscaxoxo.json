I almost died from Legionnaire's disease, a nasty form of pneumonia, because it affects primarily older men with other health problems. I was a young woman and otherwise perfectly, so they did not even consider that diagnosis. I said I felt like I was dying and they actually told me I was a \"bored housewife\" and there was no need for an xray. It took months for me to find a doctor who figured out what was wrong. If your fiancee is a young woman, they likely thought that she was \"too young\" to have breast cancer. You have every right to be angry, and things will never change unless we speak up.",

When mine flares, I have a \"bruised\" feeling in the top of my hand, my forearm and more rarely my upper arm. When it settles down, that feeling goes away. It also could be cording, which is uncomfortable (and gross) but not harmful and can be broken up with massage. Therapy did not help me. I did everything they recommended. For me, running is the best thing for my lymphedema. My arm bothers me much less on days when I go for a good run. Like you, I had double mx and nodes out (29) on the affected side. I wear a glove and sleeve from the time I wake until 7pm. The science of lymphedema is in its infancy, and I have heard a lot of contradictory information from experts, so I try different things and stick with what feels better. I hope you find some reprieve.",
