I lean heavily towards the latter right now.  I do NOT want to go thru this again.  ",

I was wasting away from the diarrhea, the joint pain (which isn't gone yet almost 10 months later) and had hearing loss that left me almost needing hearing aids. I was terrified to continue and lose my hearing. So we stopped and I had surgery and since she got clean margins and it hadn't spread to nodes we agreed on no more chemo. I consulted with 4 different oncologists who all agreed and many of them said that they believe 4 can be enough when it responds and there is significant danger of doing more harm with no benefit. I'm glad you are at peace with your decision. The long term side effects of chemo are no joke. It took me a long time (and a lot of consults) to get there but I am convinced now! Best wishes for you.",

I just had one lymph node out and my right arm was pretty much useless for 2-3 days and still remains quite hampered 11 days out.  Simple things like getting dressed, showered and making myself a sandwich are challenging and tiring.  You'll want to call in the troops for additional help during your first week, maybe even 2 after surgery.  I still have drains and limited movement so I can 't drive myself anywhere.  Which drives  me batty.   As for chemo, the other ladies are right - you can't predict how it will go for you you.  I was young, healthy and in decent shape and it knocked me on my butt.  The cocktail I was given gave me terrible GI issues and even when we got those under control after the first round,  I was routinely sidelined for 4-5 days after each treatment but then generally was able to function and return to my mothering and work duties.  However,  I have one friend who only missed 5 days of work during her entire treatment  and another who despite having a newborn and undergoing chemo is up and about and only a little tired.  They just can't predict how it will hit you.  Generally speaking you'll get chemo every three weeks and that first week may be pretty crappy but then you'll feel stronger and stronger the next two until it's time to do it over again.     You're going to need help to get through this, don't hesitate to ask friends and other family to sign up.  There are a few websites out there where people can sign up for meals or any other task like driving to/from doctors appointments.  We used lottahelpinghands.  I laughed at the idea but it's been priceless to have a meal dropped off and just to know that there is an army of people ready to help you whenever you need it.  Learning to accept help has been the hardest - and best - part of my journey through this crap.  Best of luck to you. ",

This is my second go around on the chemo train. i was treated for Her2+ with TCHP in 2014, had a BMX and reconstruction and got that \"Pathological Complete Response\" only to be diagnosed with a local recurrence early this month. I start AC on Tuesday. I'll have four rounds, then 12 weeks of Taxol = Herceptin + Perjeta, surgery AGAIN and then radiation. Thanks for posting all your side effects from AC. I can give anyone info on TCHP - I had a hell of a time with the side effects from that one! I live just outside Washington DC and have twin boys who are 9. I hate putting them through this again. I had my port placed friday and dang that hurt! I didn't remember it hurting so badly last time. I'll check back in after Tuesday.",

I won't lie - the next few weeks are going to be stressful and hard. Some unsolicited advice? 1.  Take someone to appointments with you to take notes - the docs will throw lots of terminology that you may not understand yet and ask you to make treatment decisions when you have so little understanding of your options.  2.  Ask for something  to help you sleep (Ativan was my lifesaver in those first stressful weeks) 3. This forum is terrific for info and support but also ask about local groups so you can connect with real life new friends. I am hopeful that your cancer is easily treatable and you will kick cancer's butt! ",

Not to get too graphic but I lost 11 lbs in one weekend and ended up in the hospital. I take Align but there are several good options. I've had the bowling ball feeling all week too - not sure what to do about that. Otherwise I've found this first round of AC WAY more tolerable than the TCHP. The TCHP had me in the bed from day 2 on. I've been up and about and feeling decent all week, even went to a social event for an hour last night. The soreness started so I took an epsom salt bath and that seems to have helped. Now of course I worry it's not working. LOL.",
