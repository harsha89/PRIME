Last 2 weeks I developed quite a sun burn. Using aloe and aquaphor but it doesn't seem to be working. Read about Emu oil and started it using it on the weekend. It really made a difference, just wondering if anyone else has used it. It seems wonderful but RO doesn't know enough about it. Anyone else used it or has any other additional information about risks. Thanks, God BlessÂ all",
