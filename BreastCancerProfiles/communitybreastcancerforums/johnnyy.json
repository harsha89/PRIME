    "Content": "Aug 23, 2009 03:47PM - edited Aug 23, 2009 04:11PM by johnnyy My wife had a port installed, in her right upper chest area 5 days ago, her arm neck and shoulder are so painful, that she can't even move, had to take her to the emergency room over the weekend. They injected a diferent pain killer (Ketoroloc) which can only be used for 5days  and wrote  prescription and the pain is just about bearable now. Wonder if there is a possibility, the port might be pressing on a nerve. She feels like a nerve is pinched, she will see the surgeon tomorrow.",
