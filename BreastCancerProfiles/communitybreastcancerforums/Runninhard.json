Not a surgery center just office? He also went straight from Needle biopsy to removal of lump with no mammogram or ultrasound. Said it was a time and money savings to just get it removed as most likely it would need removed after diagnostics anyway. Again is this normal? I trust my Doctor but this is all so foreign... Should I be seeing a specialist? Log in to post a reply",
