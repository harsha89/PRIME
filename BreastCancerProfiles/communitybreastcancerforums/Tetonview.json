They are also far from grumpy. Actually, they both have a great sense of humor and are brilliant and dedicated. Is it just breast surgeons that are grumpy? What do you mean by your post \"you don't even have anything yet\" AND \"even if you do, the surgeon's part is quick and short.\" I must be losing something in translation or else it is because I am new to this Board but I don't understand your comments. Could you please rephrase them? Long story short - I am still trying it figure out what to expect at the Breast Surgeon's office - I still don't know from this Post. The question was the soleÂ purpose of my post. Thanks.",

My GYN said that by the feel of the lumps and the locations (breast, chest and under arm), coupled with the suspicious lung nodules which we are already watching that I needed the Surgeon sooner rather than later. Redweasel, good luck today. Thank you robink, Redweasel and wishiwere. Your help is invaluable to me. I feel like I am walking through a dark forest going \"Huh, what??\"",

Can you tell I am a bit freaked about it all. My DH is on a business trip and won't be back until late Fri so I have to go by myself. Yikes. Anyway, what shoud I know? Thanks.

He has scheduled me for several ultrasounds this Friday. We will go from there, review the results, and he may do some biopsies right there (using the ultrasound), he may schedule an MRI or he may say they are all cystic lumps and get out of here. That would be the best option. He found more lumps under my arm, on my chest, and on the right breast. I think there are too many to be any thing to worry about. Sure hope I am right! I will update again. Thanks for your help.",
