I was dx with breast cancer in the fall of 2009.  I had 2 surgeries, one in September to remove one tumor and then another surgery in October 2009 to do a sentinel node biopsy and at which time the doc found another tumor. I then had chemo from December 2009 to February 2010, and then 30 days of radiation therapy in March 2010. Sometime around September 2010 I noticed that I started to have difficulty with range of motion with the side that I had surgery on and the breast cancer and also frozen shoulder.  Here it is now just over 4 months since noticing the frozen shoulder and it is allot worse and much more pain...  just wondering if something can be done about this.  No have not gone to doc yet, although have appt scheduled for February 22.

As for radiation, they aim the radiation at the underarm and also at the site of the scar tissue which is at the side of the breast. What is truncal lymphedema and Axillary Web Syndrome, I can try and google some stuff. Binney, thank you for popping in and replying to my message, it is appreciated.  Tomorrow I will be meeting with my new Medical Oncologist, as did not like the previous.  I will then be bringing to the attention of this Oncologist my arm problem and also there is a Lymphdema Clinic in the hospital and will request a referral to this clinic - I am hoping there will not be a cost to attend this clinic and that it is covered by the Ministry of Health being that the clinic is in the hospital.

Oh when I try to raise my right arm ( I feel a bit of pressure in the upper part of my right chest) Yes my treatments were on the right side and the breast cancers were the right breast.  So ladies does this sound like any possibility of 'radiation induced brachial plexo pathy' , or some other radiation induced condition?   I would really appreciate any and all feedback.   I have an appt with my Radiation Oncologist March 15th and would like to take to him a possible dx.... Thanks ladies...   really frustrated with this arm - the more I use it - even for typing - more it bothers me. Charmaine",

My hair just means allot of me. It just makes me wonder if the hairdresser will be able to get a even dye job on me when most of my hair is a salt and pepper color and the back of it is a huge blotch of black? Charmaine",

The interesting thing now that I have discovered, is the hair roots of the hair under the peach fuzz are really very dark (nearly black), and the peach fuzz was all a mixture of white, gray and dark. and now the roots are very dark.  My natural hair color from eons ago (I have been dying my hair now since early 30's was dark brown with auburn highlights).   So I am really curious as to what color my hair is gonna turn out to be with these dark roots.  Hair Stylist feels the dark roots are salt/pepper... hmmm   I guess we will soon find out. The hair stylist said that the hair will grow even faster now...  probably over the weekend and/or on Monday gonna go to the Health Store and pick up a bottle of Biotin. Charmaine",

The message was in reference to applying eyebrow powder as good as I did with the eyebrow pencil and applying it so the eyebrows appear thin.  It was also in reference to whether I feel the 'beautician' chose the right eyebrow powder color for me 'soft brown' - I will show here the color of the eyebrow powder that the Beautician chose for me (cannot return it now as have used it 7 times and cannot find the bill. Here is the 'smashbox' eyebrow powder - color the beautician chose for me :-  and here is a picture of me with the eyebrow powder applied - I am going to have to get a eyebrow pencil that is harder so as to apply it better. The softer brush does not do so good of a job for me, as you will see from the picture.  You can see how dark the eyebrow powder is on me from the picture too (might appear slightly lighter as I put the wax on top). With the powder I am also not very good at applying the same on each brow.  ",

My hair is more salt/pepper at the back and grayish white at the sides and top.  I was going to go for highlights.  However different ladies that I have encountered and spoken with in my own community tells me to leave my hair color as it, and not to even dye it and including the hairstylist and people in my building where I live too.  Everybody loves my hair color and I am starting to get use to the color too.   At one time before I was dx with cancer I would not be caught with gray hair lol   But heck I turned '50' recently so I do not mind so much now... My eyebrows towards the beginning of the brow needs to be shaped (too much brow hair - all unaligned) and the rest of brow hair is coming in sparse).  So gonna find a salon that is good at shaping brows vie waxing (familiar with one who has lost brow hair from chemo). Oh.. btw, going to the GT next Sunday the 8th August - Sherri or other ladies if you are going. Charmaine",

I had 2 types of breast cancer Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma, the secondary breast cancer was not discovered until the second surgery, Just for your general information ladies.  ILC does not show up in a mammogram and was told this by the technicians and it is difficult to also find a mass and/or lump just by feeling around.  So all ladies, when you are getting your annual mammograms, please also make sure that you get a breast ultrasound too, if your doctor has not requested this for you - you ASK for it and educated him on the fact of the ILC not showing up in a mammogram. I had chemotherapy and also RADS.   Chemo was from December 2 to February 2nd and I had for rounds of chemo.  RADS was from March 2 to March 30 and had 23 rounds of RADS and 5 BOOSTS. I got quite the burn (particularly in the area of the areola/nipple of which has peeled quite a bit in the past 9 days and also in the area of the under arm and going down the side of the breast to the incision.  In the past week the redness in that area along the side / from under arm has turned brown (however it is now gonna remain like a tan I can tell, more like dead skin that is in the process of gonna peel off big time). Otherwise, still feeling tired from time to time.  I am finding it hard to get house work and other stuff done around here as have to use my right arm, the upper part of right arm around the under arm part if swollen (probably from radiation) and when I use it to much, bothers me big time).  So watching how much I do.

Oh another thing, when I saw my GP, I had mentioned to him 2 weeks ago when my husband and I were out in the community here.  I got this chest pain, and it went into my left arm and a little while afterwards even into my left side of face (felt numb and like pins and needles) << that feeling lasted for few hours >>> but the chest pain maybe few minutes.. and the pain in arm probably a few days.  (this is not first time I have experienced this - few times over the years).  GP also told me that chemo can affect the heart.   So he gave me a requisition for a 'Stress Test' (treadmill and more) <<< 1 1/2 hour test then 3 hour break and come back 1 1/2 hour test again at the hospital <<< so makes for a 6 hour day.  Husband is now worried that there is something wrong with my heart.... Oh and finally, being I am nearly 7 months post surgery for breast, 3 months post chemo and just over 1 month post RADS GP has sent me for blood work up - so will get this done tomorrow.  One of the blood tests is called: CEA LEVELS >>>> for those that do not know what CEA Leves test is: http://www.tc-cancer.com/tumormarkers.html My GP has always been good for looking out for and after me :) Charmaine",

Also, my BC Surgeon has me scheculed for a colonoscopy in November 23.  As there has been blood in my stools for awhile now and I had brought this to his attention...   I have had problems with my colon for several years - so he feels he needs to look more into this.

First developed last August sometime, and the doctor that was replacing my GP while on vacation gave me 'prednisone' at the time to treat it.  (as was allot of discomfort).  Now this entire year since beginning of year - intermittently get some discomfort. (burning, numbing feeling in side of face to side of lower mouth by lips - and my left eyebrow to left eye has become more droopy).",

I have a bad burn particularly in the area of my underarm, and also on my areola and nipple.  (the area on the areaola and nipple is really beginning to crack and peel) and underarm area is really very red. The RADS Oncologist first prescribed me a cortisone cream but I took a reaction to it, and then prescribed me a silver sulfadiasine cream and some areas surrounding underarm and areas of breast not burned I develop a rash that looks like I am taking a reaction to this.  But especially the area where I put the sulfa cream only gets redder and starts to itch and burn some, looks like blistering starting up and looks like it is creating some dead skin too.  hmmm I think I might even like to try and give this medicated pad a try...  I finished radiation on March 30th, and started it on March 2nd (I started burning around the 10th day). Thanks, Charmaine",
