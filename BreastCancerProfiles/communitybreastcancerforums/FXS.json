She took a look and said I don't feel anything. I don't think it is IBC but let's get you a diagnostic mammo anyway. The spot is still there. There are some odd marks near by that are not on my other breast -- like tiny dimples. The mammogram is scheduled for Tuesday. I was diagnosed out of the blue last year with a serious heart condition for which I am scheduled to have open heart surgery in August. I know you all cannot diagnose me and I don't rely on google. But I'm anxious. So anxious I'm not telling my husband, who is already worried sick about my heart. Can anyone provide any info that could help me get through the next few days?? Thanks!!

I called my gyn explained the situation and they fit me in in 10 mins. IBC is deadly and I wasn't willing to wait 3 months to get an answer from my derm. And since this is a forum for anxious folks who have not been diagnosed, not sure why you would ask this...",
