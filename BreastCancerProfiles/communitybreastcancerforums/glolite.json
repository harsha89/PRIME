I have a really cool LE therapist who thinks outside the envelope and told me about the pycnognol. I'll have to tell her about the liver damage. This condition is a bit of a trail and error but I keep adding to my arsenal. I'm looking forward to my rebounder arriving and I'll check out the web sight. Me...LOL...I'm doing very well!  I'm here ..I'm alive! Binney,I truly enjoy your insight and wisdom. You are a fountain of information and I marvel at your knowledge.Just wanted to let you know that I appreciate you. Glo  ",
