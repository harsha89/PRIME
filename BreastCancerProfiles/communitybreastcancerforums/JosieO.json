He was outstanding-clearly knew my file in detail, answered all of my questions, and was very caring and compassionate. May I ask, how did this relationship come to be? If he was selected/assigned to you, can you go back and request a change? Explain that you would like to work with someone whom you can better communicate with. Also, the treatment center I used had several ROs on site. Had I needed to make a change, I could have done so. So maybe investigate making a change at your current location before your treatment starts, so you don\u2019t have to take on more driving. Also, I would suggest that you make your surgery choice on what gives you the greatest peace of mind. As I have read many times, sometimes to do less is good. You can always go forward later if circumstances dictate a mastectomy, but you can\u2019t reverse it. The breast cancer literature generally views lumpectomy plus radiation as offering the same survival rateas a mastectomy. Of course, we all need to decide on what is best for us. It\u2019s your body, your life, and you need to be comfortable with your choice and the physicians who treat you. So I would encourage you to get the best possible mix of location, good physician, and expected outcome. My very best to you.",

I think for most women knowing what your doctors will do will give you strength and more confidence. Sounds like your doctor is thinking to reduce the size of the tumor with chemotherapy before surgery. I believe that is generally a good approach. The thought behind radiation is that it destroys stray cancer cells. Ask as many questions as you need to-you need to feel comfortable with the plan, and your surgeon will understand that. You\u2019ll also find this website a tremendous resource-incredibly strong women who give freely of their knowledge and experience. You\u2019ll be ok. Standing behind you in support",

The second opinion surgeon who I ultimately chose studied everything, them ordered a wire localization for my lumpectomy. Like reflect, it took a long time to position, and ultimately there were areas where the cancer was not easily palpable, and areas not identified initially in the ultrasound as cancerous proved to have cancer as well. So I was extremely thankful that I had skilled doctors, because the end result might have been very different. My surgeon removed it all, left me with a beautiful cosmetic look (other than the scars my breast was smooth and round-no dents, divots, or dimpling). So I vote for localization vs just ultrasound. In my view, an experienced surgeon will use more technique vs less. Best wishes to you going forward. ",

Not sure exactly why, but I do know that the tissue slides are specially prepared and are not processed locally. And because there are such a large number of gene expression assays evaluated (70 for MammaPrint vs 22 for Oncotype) there is a lot of information to collect and evaluate. 2) MammaPrint is generally thought to give a more definite, yes or no answer, whereas Oncotype had an \u201cintermediate\u201d category that was subject to more individual interpretation. The very recent (2018) results of the TAILORx clinical trial were intended to further \u201ctighten\u201d interpretation of a \u201cmid range\u201d score from Oncotype testing. I believe that for these reasons (and probably others) that MammaPrint is often used to add clarity to Oncotype results, but I don\u2019t believe that Oncotype is used to clarifyMammaPrint. (If someone has had that experience with both tests, that would be very helpful to understanding) There is also the issue of how one\u2019s insurance will cover the testing. Some policies only cover one or the other, not uniformly both. Like others who have commented, I also had a large tumor and lymph node involvement-what might be referred to as \u201cclinically high risk\u201d. But my MammaPrint results clearly showed \u201clow risk\u201d and I was advised that chemotherapy would not add value. I followed that advice and proceeded with radiation and hormone therapy. I am comfortable with my decision. I do encourage you to discuss with your medical team, and make sure you understand the tests and how they are interpreted. Then you will have peace of mind in the information and your decisions. Best wishes to you.",

My diagnosis is very much like yours, EXCEPT I had one cancerous lymph node. So I knew before any planning was even scheduled that I would be treated in the supine position, I would have my axcilla and my clavicle areas radiated, and that I would get a large number of treatments. During the planning, I was tested with the DIBH, which made me a little nervous, but if I had to do it I would. When my treatments started, I was not required to use the DIBH. When I asked, the radiation oncologist told me he had looked at both using/not using, and decided that the difference was so slight that he chose not to make me use it. His detailed description of how he saw the beams addressing my areas gave me confidence that he knew what he was doing and that I did not need to worry about possible harm to my heart or lung. And it proved to be true. I finished my radiation a little over one month ago, and I was very pleased with how well I felt. (I only had some skin ulceration at the very end) I knew I had the right plan and an excellent radiation oncologist. So I agree that the simulated planning should have the best possible option for you, so keep asking and discussing and feel confident in the people and facility you choose. Best wishes",

Comments about the two: Aloe vera gel - over the counter, not expensive, easy to find in stores. Not greasy, dried without feeling sticky. I kept it in my refrigerator which made it feel very cool to my skin. Miaderm - also over the counter, fairly expensive, had to purchase directly from the manufacturer via internet (also found it on Amazon). Creamy, spread nicely, not greasy. For me, key to using these was to use them often. I applied them nightly after my shower, took one with me and applied it right after my treatment, and a couple more times throughout the day, such as after my workout. You can\u2019t use anything for a couple of hours before your treatment, so plan accordingly. My skin held up very well, with only a small irritation right at the end of treatment. I kept using them for about another month after my treatment ended. Also, be very careful to use a high spf sunscreen when you are outside. You can get a reaction if you don\u2019t Your radiation oncologist may have suggestions for specific products. I discussed with mine and he approved. Best wishes with your treatments.",

Reading the responses so far, i\u2019m starting to think that there are issues keeping more breast cancer patients from accessing this technology: 1) insurance - when technology is new, insurance will often not cover it, or cover it so thinly that doctors have to refer patients to the more conventional therapies. I know my insurance would have not covered it. 2) geographic availability - although I live in a large, established state, there is only one proton therapy facility here. My sense is that patients who want it may be traveling out of state to obtain it. 3) medical priority - what types of patients are accepted may be a factor. I can appreciate that children, patients with challenging tumors, and other, more unusual situations may be given a higher priority I personally think if you can get access, you should go for it. I appreciate the learning your post has generated.",

I accepted that without getting upset, and because I had some undissolved sutures I waited almost six weeks before my radiation started. During my wait I had occasional anxiety that I had rogue cancer cells floating around setting up new homes. Now having started radiation, I have become occasionally anxious thinking about things like \u201cmy thyroid is getting destroyed by radiation\u201d; when I have no evidence of same. For myself, I recognize that these anxieties will decrease over time. Most importantly, I have a great team of physicians that I trust, so I think if something develops, I know they will be there to give me the verybest care.

All of my doctors are big proponents of exercise. I was exercising 3 times weekly, then as I was preparing to start radiation I increased it to 5 times weekly. My radiation is very early (7 am hour), so afterwards I stop off at the gym before I head home or on to errands, other things. At the gym I use the weight machines then finish with 30 minutes on the treadmill. I\u2019ve not yet felt fatigued, so I go home and do laundry, household chores, shopping, gardening-pretty much a full day. (I\u2019m retired) Biking is a different issue, especially since you have to factor in being fresh and clean at your job. I\u2019m generally a strong sweater during the summer, but currently I bring wipes and deodorant with me, and clean up a bit after my radiation. Once I get home and finish my day, I get a shower. So that is manageable. I would say to not be afraid of exercise-just figure out what form it should be and where in your day you can do it. Best wishes as you move forward",

I was diagnosed via biopsy with invasive ductal carcinoma, but when my surgeon opened up the area I had a significant amount of DCIS which had not been detected on mammogram, ultrasound, or even biopsy. Fortunately my surgeon was highly experienced, quick to think it through and he was able to remove all of my DCIS as well as the tumor and surrounding tissue. I had a lumpectomy, no chemo, but as my cancer is highly positive for estrogen and progesterone, I knew that long term hormone therapy would become my treatment.

Otherwise no fatigue, nausea-nothing like that. Could you possibly get from your radiation oncologist more detail on how he/she would plot your radiation? Can they use IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy), which as I understand creates a targetedset of smaller beams? Can they use a shorter course/ fewer sessions? How can they protect your heart/lung/thyroid? I see a number of different percentages, but I wonder if they can all agree on the effects you can minimize. Will be thinking good thoughts for you.",

I am highly responsive as well, and know that there is no assurance on \u201ckill vs dormant\u201d. I have confidence in my team, so I did do radiation. I continue to keep you in my thoughts and wish you good results however you decide",
