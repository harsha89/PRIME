I buried her mama and took this 6 wks old kitten home. I meowed at her for about ten minutes trying to keep her from running. It worked. She likes to perch on the back of my computer chair, kinda like a parrot and then gives me kisses. Joan",

Had treatments three weeks on with Avastin on the first and third week. Skipped chemo on week four. Recently, my onc stopped the Avastin for a while. Now I'm just doing Abraxane every other week. Side effects from Avastin included blisters on my hands, neuropathy in my hands and feet and low hemoglobin counts. While having both in my treatments, my liver spots have disappeared and the pleural effusion is significantly less. My tumor markers have also fallen to nearly normal. We will probably go back to the Avastin in a month. I don't know how long I'll have to be on this but so far so good. I also wondered why this combo of drugs isn't used as a first line chemo. Avastin was originally used just for metastatic colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. I am not positive that it's been approved yet for breast cancer, but we still have been able to use it. Best to you all. Topo",
