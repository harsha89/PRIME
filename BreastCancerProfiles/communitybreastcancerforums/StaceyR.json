Last night the pain was so bad I took myself back to the ER.  The people putting the chest tube in were about to leave for the day and kind of neglected to tell me what kind of pain to expect, didn't give me anything for pain, and didn't really explain how to care for the tube.  In my partially sedated and frozen state yesterday I failed to realize things would get worse before getting better.

When I saw my oncologist before the next round, I asked her about taking less and she said there wasn't a lot of research on it, so not to mess around with it, at least on the day prior and the day of treatment, and to self-monitor for difficulty breathing.  So I dutifully took the 16 mg for two days and only took 4 mg the third day.  And I was fine (but wired, of course). It is kind of wild to me that there is this blanket dosage given, no matter what you weigh and how you respond.  The Taxotere manufacturers' website recommends 16 mg / day.  I met a woman who said she had a bad reaction to the Taxotere and stayed on the decadron for TEN days!  I would be bouncing off the walls...",
