Please try to occupy your thoughts on other things. I had a rare form of BC called Paget's, with underlying DCIS. From my understanding, DCIS will often show up as microcalcification. Even if you are facing a diagnosis... know that treatment has come a long way! Hang in there... ",

I had more discomfort from the catheter (I have a tilted uterus, so with the swelling, my urine did not drain properly)....the surgery itself I felt very little pain! They kept pushing drugs on me, which make me sick and crazy. I finally refused them and did so much better. I just didn't need them. Took nothing after I came home 4 days after surgery. It took me over 3 weeks to stand straight...and that hurt my back.  I also had numbness under my cancer side armpit and back of arm. It has finally subsided....I currently have some intermittent aching on that side. Nothing really painful. After stage 2 I just had Motrin...but even then I got up right after surgery feeling fine. Very happy about the surgery...although I do need another revision. (I had big natural breasts and not enough fat to fill the holes....so I need multiple fat grafting to fill in) The fat grafting lipo donor area from stage 2 was very sore in certain situations...getting up/down, etc. I'd say that was more painful than stage 1...and even that was manageable.

She said I could wear a sleeve if I wanted...but that flight does not increase risk of developing lymphedema. PS does the surgery to treat this and has spoken/written on the condition. She said flight may bring on symptoms in undiagnosed LE, but they have studied rates of stewardesses with breast cancer and there was no difference in rates of those developing LE with others.  No bug bites, air flight, sunburns, needle pricks, hot tubs, overexertion....So, I wonder how much of the preventative measures really prevent...but rather just delay onset of symptoms? I suppose we want to prevent if we can...but I think the real causal factors are the surgeries and treatments that go along with the cancer. I guess I'm not sure there is anything we can do to prevent or cause this affliction on ourselves. I pray I have an uneventful (LE free) flight and week in Florida at Disneyworld!!!!",
