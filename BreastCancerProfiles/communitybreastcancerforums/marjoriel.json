(ha-ha) I was trying to find more about this type and not much out their. go figure. other than it's a rear form of Breast Cancer and only 2-3% of women have it. It's a slow-growing type and responds to treatment much better than the others. do. My doctor also said that in his twenty years I am only his second patient to have it. And if you had to have it, It's the one you want.  I shell call my self the lucky ducky.   Six months ago, I went in for my yearly mammogram and they found a small lump in my t breast. to make a long story short my doctor sent me to see a surgeon for a second opinion and he went through everything and even he said it looks like a regular fibroid, but something was making his eyebrow raise, so he order a ultrasound to be done in six month. Well in that time it grew a little so a biopsy was done and January 22,2010 I received my result that It was Mucinous Breast cancer. Feb. 8,2010 had a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy with a lumpectomy and the path report came back with specks in the margin. Feb.17,2010 In for the trim job (ha-ha) .Hope they get it all.  Feb.19,2010 My path report came back and YES!! they got it all and now I am wating  for radiation treatment,  meet with my doctors next month and that wear I am right now. sorry to be so long winded I have never done this before .
