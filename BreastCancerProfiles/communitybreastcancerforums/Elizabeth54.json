I get on the bed in the after-noon for a rest but up again 20 mins later after staring at the ceiling. Can sleep for 1 hour at a time with two tablets of Temazepam then up all night and hence a new day. No appetite at all. I have been doing this for days and worried about the effect over all. Doc and oncologist want to start me on anti depressants but I am not depressed. It cannot go on as I need to eat & sleep but just can't.My home looks amazing! Round 3 April 7th. Anyone suffering oh I have all the other stuff too. Please help Log in to post a reply",
