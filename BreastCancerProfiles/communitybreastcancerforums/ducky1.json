I was able to keep up with every day chores, the house, etc.. I did not work as I am a teacher and my immune system was compromised.

Infusion of my 3 meds. was 2 1/2 hrs. and I always brought a friend along to keep me company.

Barb, I asked my doc for a copy of my path report then asked questions. You have a right to the document so call girl! Docs are not always forcoming. It will tell you your ER-PR status as well as Her2. My onc. is the one who told me what stage and grade I was at, not the surgeon. Did it hurt when they removed the drains? My mom said that it did for her. Like Shirlann, I sailed through rads. and made a true connection with my techs who were fantastic. When you see someone every day, you develop a rapport. Ok, funny story from school... I was reviewing what the kids should do as they walk down the hall (grade 1) on Monday...one says \" don't talk\", the other \"hands behind your back\" and the last \"breathe!!!\" He said it in all sincerity... what a hoot!!

There are gals on this site very knowledgeable about masec. who can answer your questions but here go a few... I was part of a program at a hospital called Healing Connections which was great. They had us meet every 2 wks. 3x and discussed eating, problems, lymphedema..you name it, we asked!! They also had physio sessions for all of us; the gals who had masectomies usually had less range of motion so gentle stretches are essential...only as far as you can go..no pushing! You should inquire and see if anything similar is available. If not, this might be something to pursue once you are totally over this journey. Ours is totally put on by volunteers who have been through BC. There is also a nurse employed by hospital for medical questions and ladies who bring in specialty camisoles, bras, prosthesis', etc... so you can browse in comfort without feeling self-conscious. If I were retired, I would become involved. I had a lump. followed by chemo then radiation for 6 wks. which is pretty standard so I got to know the techs. pretty well. They were terrific! Then again, I felt a great need to connect with them and not be just another face. I wanted them to recognize me without me having to flash \"me boob!!\" and they did! I'll check in again before we go away Sat. Hugs, Cath ",

Five DAYS later the mass was removed so it can be really quick depending on your doc as well as how busy the surgeons are!! As for staging, they can give you an educated guess but it is not until they get your path. report after surgery that all is confirmed. It was my onc. who shared the path report with me. Upset...numb...not when they told me that I had cancer...as I somehow knew that I did and could FINALLY move forward. Like you Barb, I was more worried about keeping the house running and \"normalcy\" for my 13 & 14 yr. old and I did succeed (am now at the other end of the tunnel). Late at night, in the comfort of my ducky's arms, I did break down out of fear that I would not be around for them. I have seen and heard too much this last yr. to take life for granted... Like Erica, I never said \"why me?\"...it just is, what it is and I dealt with it. I also needed to be strong for my hb. as it was terribly diff. for him; you see, he had cancer himself in 2001.  Looking back over this past yr. since my discovery Jan 13th, I realize how quickly the yr. has gone by.. Jan. I go back to work and try to attain a \"new\" normal. Let us know the news... :) cath ",

Here in Canada, there is no tolerance for drunk drivers. That is crappy that it's at the other end of town. Are buses an option? a good friend? When I had chemo, I set it up so that I had a diff. person each time that came with me... I don't like to put people out but they felt good about contributing in this small way. I would bet you could count on some people...church members? By the way, if you are a reader, there are some great books out there that really helped me along the way.

I was off work for the duration of chemo (low white blood count  makes you very susceptible to anything esp. when around little kiddies) and rads. (very disruptive to the kids). No regrets! Now is the time to take care of yourself and make yourself a priority so you won't have to worry about this blasted disease coming back. I feel like my happiness is on the mend... not that I wasn't a \"suck it up\" type of gal but the big C always seemed to be looming around. I am feeling more \"normal\" whatever that may be. I do understand about your hb. saying that he was stressed. Mine was also on pins and needles!!  About the chemo and Neulasta... chemo was fine for the first few days until  I went off the steroids then I felt nauseous for a while... NOT all of us have the same reaction. From what I have read on this site about Neulasta, it can cause a great deal of joint pain BUT not in everyone...so cross that bridge when you get there, K? We go through one hurdle at a time... surgery, OVER...healing, HAPPENING ;) You will fly through this as you have such a positive attitude. I never had the option of Neulasta or Neupogen shots (not in Canada, eh?) It would have cost $2,700 per shot and I needed approval from ins. so just stuck with chemo every 4 wks. rather than 3. Diane, you are wise to ask for a med. to combat pain. Hang in there!! How many txs are you having and what is your \"cocktail\" of choice?? XCath ",

If you want to go this route, let me know and I<ll recommend some of my faves. Many gals seem to have read Susan Love<s book about bc but when I looked through it, it wasn<t what I was looking for. When you meet with your onc., they usually go over your path report (after surgery) but since you are doing chemo first, that most likely won<t happen. Has your doc told you what stage? grade? of cancer that you have? Your age, whether you are in menopause or not, family history, etc... all factor in when they are giving you chemo options. Because I was pre-meno. and that my cancer was moving towards the lymph system, a certain chemo was recommended and I felt confident with their recommendations. My lump was 2.1 so I opted for a lumpectomy and am happy with the results. Remember, you make the decision...it is always your choice!! One of my chemos (Epirubicin) pretty much collapsed whatever vein they were using. The good news is that other veins take over from the other one. My last tx I asked for a picc line (google it and port on this site and it will give you a picture and more accurate explanation than I can) Chemo was so easy with the line as the nurses did not have to poke around for a vein that would work (I offered my bum that they were not too thrilled with that... go figure!!!) Hair... mine starting growing back within a few wks. after chemo was over. Weight...I lost 6lbs each first wk. of tx as nothing was appealing. However, I gained it back once I felt somewhat >normal>. I walked throughout tx. Some people gain (steroids and stress) while others lose...again, it varies like which chemo they recommend or how you react. You shouldn<t need any special skin creams for chemo...apart from a good moisturizer as my skin dried and cracked (hands). Once you meet with your onc. and have a start date, join one of the chemo cruises. Unfortunately, there is a new thread each month with lots of ladies who will support you... and I will be here Bottom line is that yup, I am ok!! I am going back to work part-time in Jan. and looking forward to finding a New NORMAL as the journey changes us. Take care Xcath ",

My dad died of lung cancer when he was 57; actually, it is not the removal of the lung that killed him but a subsequent infection. That has greatly affected how I view life... do it NOW before you are 10ft under! You know the story where the couple finally retires and one dies and they had lots of plans... that was my parents but it's not going to be me. I have done a lot of traveling in my life and our kids' first trip out of North A. was on our 10th wedding anniversary and it hasn't stopped since. I want to squeeze every single bit of juice out of that orange...ok, that was really long winded but that's what it means I am very glad that you have an appt. for the onc. I know that you mentioned having a child... son, daughter? both? how old? take care my friend Cath ",

The 2 wks. will actually fly by... keep yourself busy! Actually, the worst anxiety is over (or at least it was for me)... now it is just a matter of them telling you how many txs you will have and what your cocktail of choice will be. There are so many options out there. You said that you have 2 lumps; where are they located? You may not need rads. if they are not close to your chest wall!! and if you have a masectomy!! That said, rads. were much easier than other txs. I am off to paint...again Have a great wkd. Cathy ",

I thought of you on your surgery day and sent good vibes your way Did they definately say that you are having chemo and rads. cause sometimes gals who have masectomies don't need rads... wouldn't that be great!  Our trip was a healing one... I rarely thought of the C word... just enjoyed my family and life in general. I could live in Maui in a heartbeat... sigh! Now I am back at work half time and that is demanding but rewarding! take care will check in soon! xCath ",

You have every right to change oncs. esp. with one you are unsatisfied with!!! Holy crow!! Your hb was totally right!! You are in the \"limbo\" period before chemo when everything seems to keep us up!!! Hold on to that fighting spirit, my friend! You will see the other side of this...Deep breath...ok! Lymph nodes... 5 out 11 is not the end of the world. They have wonderful chemo that will eradicate those vilains. If your drain site has not totally healed, I would seriously question having chemo as your immune system will be compromised afterwards. A few questions.. what chemo are they giving you? Are you having Neulasta injections? Is chemo every 3 wks.? You say that you don't know what grade and stage you are; this would be useful info for you to have. My onc. shared all this with me. Did you have anyone with you when you met the onc?? If not, please bring someone with you when you meet the new guy. I had a tape recorder with me so all the info that escaped my pea sized brain is on there!! You are NOT being stupid about this. It is your LIFE that they are playing with and you have a right to some answers...NOW!! Can you tell I am pissed!! Ok...if I could fly down, I would!!! I am sending you a big hug! Do not have the chemo if you are not healed... please! I will check in tomorrow night! Love ya Cath ",

My white count would plummet and take 4 wks. to get back up there. I was vigilant about hand washing and even had one of those little containers of hand cleanser in my purse. I didn't touch taps, door handles in the hospital... stayed away from sick people. If you get a fever (yup, even 100!!), you should call the emergency # right away (if you have one... there was always a nurse on call at our hospital. I never had to call!) I did call about mouth sores and they would contact the doc and get a presc. my way. As for food, I ate whatever I wanted...just wash the veggies and fruit! I was never hungry the first wk. as I didn't feel that great but everyone is diff. :) Cath ",
