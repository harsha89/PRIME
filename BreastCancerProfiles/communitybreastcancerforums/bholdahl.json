She recently underwent a radical mastectomy, having a skin graft taken from her thigh.  She has told us that she has a 3-inch hole underneath her armpit where the skin graft is.   Through research I found out that sometimes small holes are present in skin grafts for drainage, but I personally wouldn't call a 3-inch hole \"small\". Is this normal?  Log in to post a reply",
