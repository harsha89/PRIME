I also have an aggressive cancer and am hoping that I respond well to treatment. There's so much we have to take in and realizing the road ahead is tough but you are right it's game time and we must fight and do what we need to do to get Rid of the cancer.

I have just been staged and am now stage 3, they are doing neoadjuvent chemo as they want to shrink it and clear margins in the skin before operating. I hope they are going to treat it aggressively and am wondering what other ladies treatment is i.e. is it 1 day every 21 days cycle of 3 hours? I was told I'm having 4 cycles of 2 particular drugs and then weekly cycles of something else plus herceptin. Also my MO said that I will become infertile after chemo (I asked her if I would be able to have another child when I was finished and she said no) was anyone else told they wouldn't be able to have kids but ended up being able to fall pregnant? She said since i have 2 already she was not going to work around it and I am fine with that, most important is to get rid of the cancer just curious to hear other people's opinions. xxx Dx 3/8/2016, IDC, Both breasts, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Chemotherapy 4/1/2016 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Ellence (epirubicin), Taxol (paclitaxel) Targeted Therapy 6/1/2016 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Surgery 8/28/2016 Lymph node removal: Left, Right, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left, Right Dx 2/20/2017, IDC/IBC, Both breasts, Stage IV, metastasized to brain/bone/liver/lungs/other, Grade 3, 5/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ (FISH) Targeted Therapy 2/28/2017 Tykerb (lapatinib) Chemotherapy 2/28/2017 Xeloda (capecitabine) Chemotherapy 8/1/2017 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Gemzar (gemcitabine) Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes, Chest wall Log in to post a reply",
