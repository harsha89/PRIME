They made a mold for my arm because with my shoulder replacement I am unable to raise it above my head. I received 16 treatments with the mold and with five tattoos for alignment. My breast was exposed to the three techs (two women and a man). I thought I would be embarrassed but I don't think \"modesty\" is in my vocabulary anymore! They were great with me and only the women touched my flesh. The man would move the sheet for alignment and did most of the calculations to make sure I was aligned properly. X-Rays were taken weekly, and I would see the RO weekly. When my breast started to get red the techs assured me they were keeping watch and would report anything unusual After the 16 I had to go back to sim and be measured for a lead apparatus that fastened on the rad machine to zero in on my scar area for five boosts. The tech explained the different radiation that was used for the full breast and for the scar area. He told me the boosts would be high intensity but not penetrate as deep. I was also marked up with circles and \"X's\" and four stickers were stuck on me for alignment. I could not use cream on the stickers because they needed to remain on me until the boosts were over. Today was my last boost! ðŸ˜Š I hit the gong with extreme pleasure! All the techs gave me a hug good-bye. I am red and sore but nothing like you poor women are experiencing, but they say it peaks two weeks after. The nurse told me I received 5240 Gy. Maybe they were mGy (?) I don't think she knows what she was talking about. She said they gave me the least amount. She said most women were receiving 6400 (?) I will ask the doctor when I see her in eight weeks.",

Had to take 5 pills (steroids) at 12:30 and then 5 more at 6:30 for my 10:30 infusion. By 1:30 I awoke with my chest feeling an atomic bomb had exploded! My veins felt like Alka seltzer burning in them! My heart was pounding out of my chest! I thought steroids made you feel good? Â So I sat on a kitchen chair waiting for some relief, while writing down all my maladies to tell the oncologist at 10:30. Things had calmed down by 3:30 so I went back to bed. At 4:30 awakened again with a second round of explosions! Got up and just laid my head on the kitchen counter praying to die! I laid there until 6:00 knowing that in 1/2 hour I had to take the second round of 5 pills! I thought of dumping half the pills down the sink but I knew my husband would ask if I had taken all my pills and I would have to reply \"What do you think!\"Â  At that moment I decided I could not take another one of those pills and called the on-call Dr. at MSK and told my story of woe. I asked how in the world could I take yet 5 more of these pills!? She said \"Don't\" that I would be getting more steroids in my IV and that they would have to regulate or stop the amount the would give me. Yay!! So off to my infusion, took an anti-anxiety pill, put EMLA cream and Saran Wrap on my port. Arrived on time had my finger blood stick and was shown to the infusion nurse. Took my blood pressure etc. and told me I would have to wait at least a 1/2 hr until I calmed down cause my blood pressure was sky high and my pulse was 130! They told me to BREATH.... About 1/2 hour later they checked my vitals again and said I was a little better so they would begin. The nurse swabbed the port, told me to take a deep breath and plunged the nail (oops I mean needle) through the port! Nothing, no pain, no blood squirting, no \"sorry I'll have to try again\". It was painless, and I was connected! It took 5-1/2 hours for my first infusion. First they gave me steroids, Pepcid, ant-psychotic meds ( just kidding) but they did plug in some Ativan to calm me down with the Benedryl. Then they gave me the Herceptin and finally the Taxol. A very long day. No S/E's immediately accept for the Benedryl. It gave me restless leg syndrome where I couldn't keep my legs still! Like Michael Fox with his arms. Really weird! They said they would have to discontinue the Benedryl but replace it with something else in their next concoction! Long story short- not a bad day. If it hadn't been for the prior night's horror it would have been pretty good. The nurse was great. The infusion practically pain free. Side.effects so far this morning are slight diarrhea and my face and chest are beet red like bad sunburn but no temperature. Hopefully, it won't get worse as the week goes on but time will tell. Hopefully all of you will have as good or better results!",

My last infusion (fourth) the nurse (I believe) was not certified to access my port. He tried to push the port over to the needle!

Wednesday, called the center and they had me come down for an ultrasound where the clot showed up. Then all Hell broke loose, blankets, oxygen, paramedics and my first ambulance ride to the hospital. Once there they injected my belly with anticoagulant. What a nightmare! Gave me more belly injection every 12 hours and said I would have to inject myself for the rest of my life!! I told them I don't think I could do that! So now they have me on Xarelto, a blood thinner ( that can make you have internal bleeding) just so they didn't have to remove the port! Don't get me wrong, I need the port cause I have bad veins for chemo, but my neck is still swollen and now I'm scared to death I'm going to stroke out or just die due to Â Bloodclots!

They found that with Xarelto you don't have to be \"watched\" as closely and there are no dietary restrictions. She said about a month past my chemo I could stop taking the Xarelto without bad side effects so it would not be a lifelong pill. I would ask for an ultrasound on your neck. The x-Ray showed the tube but I'm not sure you could see a clot that way! My neck looked just like yours!",

When they found the bloodclot they called paramedics and rushed me to the hospital for Lovenox shots. Next day the vascular surgeon said they would leave the port in because it was working but I would have to be on blood thinner (Xarelto) until the port is removed a year from now. She said to put warm compresses on my neck to help reabsorb the clot. My neck still hurts and is swollen from the clot. The thinner does not dissolve the clot it just keeps you from making new ones. Your body has to reabsorb the clots or your body will form a scar over it. I know, not a great scenario! I don't know how I'm going to live with this discomfort for a year, but I also don't know what I will do without a port so....... I wish you relief from your clots. If the port is still functioning you will want to keep it. From what they tell me, Cancer makes clots, and intravenous ports are prime places for your body to try to scab over the foreign object.
