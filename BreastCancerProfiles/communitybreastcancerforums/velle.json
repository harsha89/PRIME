This was not in the plan as I already had a lumpectomy and radiation earlier in the year. Had my follow up mammo last month and DCIS popped up in a different location. So I am here today to wait with you all.",

Honestly, I haven't looked at my breasts yet. I'm afraid to for some reason. Things feel so tight on me right now (Lat Flap on the left, reduction and lift on the right). All the nurses that have looked at me say they look great. Percocet has been a great help.",
