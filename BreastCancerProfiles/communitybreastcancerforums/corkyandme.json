I also started out reading everything that was published with regard to breast cancer. Then reality stepped in. How long did it take to have someone write the very book you are reading? What was the time frame on publishing the book? Science doesn't wait for the book to be written and sold! There have been so many breakthroughs in such a short time, no real book can keep up with the positive results! Before you decide on your future, check the published year, and updates available online with regard to numbers first.",

Regarding synthetic verses human, more open weave,and less weight, (cooler) with synthetic, Less maintenance, lots more styles too.Â Human hair is much much more expensive. The soft wig liner can eliminate that rough scratchy feeling,as well as absorb perspiration.",
