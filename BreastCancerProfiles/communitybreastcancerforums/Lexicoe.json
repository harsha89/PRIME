That said, it's always worth a second opinion if you're not comfortable. Just make sure to see a RO who is in another area/hospital system so they're not averse to contradicting the first one. Did you ask your RO about protecting your heart? I'm also fair-skinned with a left side cancer and we are going to do the breath hold technique, which research has shown can help lessen the effects on the heart. I am curious if anyone here has had experience with proton therapy though and hope someone chimes in! I thought I read on the MD Anderson site though that only 7 cancer centers in the US have the equipment for it--and it seems like it's been more used for other types of cancers--so thay may be why you're not getting much response.",

If you search the forum, AmusingSoprano and WildPlaces have posted links to the research studies. And you'll also see some women in the US talking about having used it too with great success. They seem to have very few skin problems and talk about how comforting it is to have something over the area to protect the skin from clothes, etc. The research has shown it can be kept on throughout the treatments because it has no \"bolus\" effect. But it must be applied by your radiation techs to make sure it doesn't change your measurements and that the edges of the pieces match up exactly without any overlap. And you're supposed to keep it on for two weeks after radiation ends, because your skin is still processing the treatment during that time. Some of the American women whose ROs were not open to it seem to have gotten similar results by applying it themselves and removing it before the treatments, then putting it back on immediately after. This is a bit of a pain and more expensive though, because you usually need several pieces to cover the area and can only stick the pieces backon a couple times before they lose adherence. (If you've ever used a product called Tegaderm for scrapes or burns or to adhere some kind of port to your skin, it seems to work in a similar way.)",

Doc was great tho and she told me it would be okay and we just switched to the right one the second week. Mepitel One and Mepitel are the wrong ones, it has to be the one exactly called Mepitel Film and says that on the outside of the package if you want to use it during radiation. (Why the company would have 3 very different products with such similar names baffles me!) I ended up finding the right stuff at CVS and CVS Online, in 4x4 and 3x2 squares. If you're going to have it on during the radiation, the techs need to apply it while you're laying in the treatment position because it may move the markings and they'll need to rejigger them. Plus. The film edges must abut and not overlap. You should be able to do it at first treatment though, instead of simulation. (Otherwise, you're wearing it for a week or two before treatments actually start!) I just took a copy of the study with me when I proposed using Mepitel to my RO, then when the techs called before the first treatment to ask how to apply it, I told them about the video on the Molynke website, which they watched. If the center won't cooperate, you can still apply the Mepitel yourself after each treatment and remove it before the next one--the very first study was apparently done that way. One woman on here found that she could get the film to re-apply for about 3 days before it wouldn't adhere anymore. The downside is replacing the film squares every 3 days is a lot more expensive. If I were to do it all over again though, I would seriously consider going this route. I just got so stressed about trying to keep the film on exactly as applied given the hot humid weather here and trying to continue my workouts! And every time I came in for treatment, they'd have to replace a piece under my arm plus trim and fill in little gaps from curling at the edges or whatnot. Unfortunately, It turns out that I am allergic to Mepitel Film (I got a bad rash) and we had to remove it before the end of the second week. So I wish you better luck with it! ",
