    "Content": "mommyluvsnoah wrote: I just found this board and wanted to introduce myself. I am a SAHM of a six year old and am 38 years old with no family history of breast cancer. I decided to go in for a baseline mammogram in May and got called back for a dense area and calcifications. Went back and after a closer look they were confident that neither area was anything to worry about but they asked me to come back in for a follow up in six months to check on the stability of the areas.  I went this past Thursday for the follow up and the dense area is still fine but there has been a \"dramatic\" change in the calcifications. So dramatic in such a short period of time that I was told they were pretty sure it was cancer and a very aggressive one at that. They did recommend an MRI first but after talking to my primary and OBGYN on Friday I have elected to go straight to the biopsy.  Both seemed to feel that such a dramatic change in six months meant that the most important thing was removing the cancer as quickly as possible.  They even have me already meeting with a breast surgeon on Thursday so that once the biopsy results come in they can move quickly.  It all seems pretty surreal to me right now.  With my age, no family history and no symptoms (lumps, etc) I am feeling a little unprepared for all this.  Trying to hope for the best here but we just lost my step-nephew in May to cancer so we know what cancer can do as we have personally experienced his two year battle and ultimate loss. I fluctuate between telling myself that I will fight this and be fine and making mental lists of all I need to do to prepare my husband and son to be able to go on without me.  And of course I am putting on a brave face for my son. To add to my stress my DH's boss is being very uncooperative about working with us so I will be going to both appointments alone since DH was unable to get either day off without giving two weeks notice. Anyway, that is my background and just wanted to introduce myself.  Sorry about the long post. If you made it all the way through, thanks for reading. Log in to post a reply",
