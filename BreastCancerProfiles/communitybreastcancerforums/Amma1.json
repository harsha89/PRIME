I guess, there is always something! Athena2047, I had my first port in till I was able to finish my real chemo drugs, Herceptin itself is a monoclonal antibody and can be infused through the peripheral veins.  I was always, what they call 'a difficult stick' and just getting access through a couple of veins, for everything, you know, blood work, scans and treatments every few weeks and months has scarred them, so I had to get a port placed the second time around, and that has been removed too.  I guess, we shall wait for a few weeks before we try another port.  I do thank you for the encouragement and support you are giving me.  Good luck to you too!  Hope things get better. Best wishes, Amma1.",
