    "Content": "Cheryegrace wrote: Hello everyone. I'm Cherye and recently turned 40. I had my first mammogram last week and they saw two small areas on my left breast that worried them enough for me to come back yesterday. So the give me a second mammogram and they said they still saw the spots so they did an ultrasound which then led to a biopsy of two different locations because they were certain the spots were not lymph nodes or cysts. I'm glad I got checked out but am really dreading this waiting. Log in to post a reply",
