I was originally alerted to a large circumscribed oval mass in the upper left quadrant of my left breast appearing on a 2015 mammogram. The mass at the time was approximately 2.5 cm. Had a biopsy of the mass in 2015 and was told that it was benign and pathology came back as a complicated cyst. Unfortunately (will never do again) I skipped a six month followup mammo in 2016 and went back in 2017 for my annual mammo and also was alarmed because it had gotten bigger. A couple of days later I had a sonogram and the radiologist comes in saying that he was still giving it a BIRADS 4 and it looked suspicious and could be fibroadenoma or phyllodes tumor. Was referred to a breast surgeon. The breast surgeon biopsied the mass about a week later. Found out that it was benign but this time pathology diagnosed it as PASH. Because the mass was rapidly growing my breast surgeon recommended that I take it out within a month. I had an excisional biopsy on May 25, 2017. Went today for my post surgical follow-up and was told that it was confirmed PASH and that I should just follow up with a mammogram in a year. This was a nerve-wracking experience however I am grateful that it's benign. Want to give hope out there to ladies with even large breast lumps that is not does not necessarily mean that it's cancer. All the best to you all. ðŸ˜Š",
