I am in Maze #2.  So, I am four years post chemo and on a journey to figure out what happened during the course of my ride on The Breast Cancer Train. I am so well aware that many of you are in fights that make my ranting seem so petty and so \"you must be kidding me?!\" and I positively will never diminish the fact that fighting for ones life is at the top of the food chain here.  Hands down.  No questions asked.  I do know how you feel.  I was terrified. My own dx was invasive lobular carcinoma.  I have a strong family history (gotten stronger in the five years since my dx with two sisters and my mom having a 2nd dx exactly 20 years after her first round of BC).  My BRCA test was \"ambiguous.\"  I have mutations on both genes, both of the mutations are of \"unknown significance\" which basically means, maybe it's something, maybe it's not ....  Myriad will let me know as things develop.  Stage 1 dx was really not a stage 1 dx.  Oncologist explained there were several schools of thoughts regarding staging of ILC.  I could have been stage 1 or stage 3 or anywhere in between.  I pick stage 1.  I am an optimist.  A realist.  But still, an optimist. I've had seven different surgeries including the biopsy that found my sneaky cancer, followed by sentinel nodes on the affected side, followed by the bilateral mastectomy which I determined was the best course of action for me, then the swap out for the reconstruction, lapro removal of ovaries and tubes.... got one year out and threw a bad pap.  A REALLY bad pap which put me back into an operating room for a cone biopsy (unrelated, but still.... when I freaked out and called my oncologist, he was the only one who SAID, \"cancer cells present\").  Two years after the cone biopsy, the surgical gyn oncologist explained it would be necessary to do a complete hysterectomy.  Had a DiVinci robot surgery.  I am fine but it's been quite a ride.  I do, however, suffer from some rather disturbing cognitive issues.  I did high level accounting in a crazy paced environment.  I can't function anymore and, just like I did when I found I had a less common type of BC, I began to research what the heck was going on inside my head. I just completed my second neurocognitive evaluation (yesterday).  I have \"number issues\" and attention disorders... and an inability to get started... I drop words....   I know I am not alone and if anyone cares to commiserate, feel free to get in touch. I remember to be grateful for chemobrain even though it IS driving me nuts because it just means we are surviving and now there is research being done to determine the underlying causes and possible ways to stop this.  I have begun to blog about it as I hope to gather whatever information I have coaxed from my internet hunting so the links are all in one place.  Right now, only a few links are on an information page.  That project is one I am still trying to \"break down into smaller more manageable pieces.\"  Hope if you are in this chemobrain club and it's affecting your \"QOL\" (quality of life....) we can keep banging on the door by standing together. I send my best to all of my \"sisters\" (and brothers) and may be all continue to \"Fight Like A Girl\" chemo-brain.blogspot.com (there is a link in my profile...)
