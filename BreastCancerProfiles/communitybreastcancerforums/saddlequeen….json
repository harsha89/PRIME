Onco Type DX came back 16 so no chemo... Radiation treatment planning CT tomorrow.  Wondering if anyone has had radiation with implants (behind the muscle)?  I am scheduled for 33 treatments.  After the radiation I am scheduled for a hysterectomy ( partial hyster. with ovary removal) so I can start the Arimidex.",

I've worked there 13 yrs in a director position over the Radiology dept. sooo I know everyone there.  I don't even care at this point, just glad to have good people taking care of me :-)",
