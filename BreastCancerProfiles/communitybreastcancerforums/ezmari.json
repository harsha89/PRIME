One of the most extreme chemos one can have, as i had a lipo sarcome, rare and aggressive (fortunately totally removed), so not really in the breast cancer area, but i believe we all suffer the same. What you said really got me. I know precisely what you meant with aging. I looked at myself in the mirror yesterday and didn't recognise the woman staring back at me. My sunken eyes the hollow cheeks, the dry skin (iused to have oily skin). The wrinkles. I'll be 40 in two week, and 2 and a half months ago when i was diagnosed people always told me they couldn't believe how old i am. Cancer and chemo does so much damage that one doesn't need this too. I am happy to hear that you are doing well. Should you by any chance find a cream you could recommend please let me know. Stay positive, and all the other cliches that come to mind:-) Remember prayers do get answered, All the best Ezmari",
