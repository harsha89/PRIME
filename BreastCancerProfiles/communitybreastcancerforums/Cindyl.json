I certainly understand the \"enough\" impulse though.  I didn't take my mobic today on the off hope that maybe I'm just really not hurting anymore, and I can discontinue 1 pill.  I'll probably be limping and cussing myself soon, but so far, so good.

It wouldn't be the first time I took in someones throw away pet. Or even throw away kid. She showed up with this huge snaaaake.  (There is no way I would have let her through the door irl, but dreams are like that) So I've got this snake that is slithering around the house trying to catch my little dogs, and and chasing a cute little siamese kitten that I've never seen before.  My big dogs are trying to catch the snake. I'm trying to convince the snake he should go catch a mouse or something.  I'm carrying the damn thing around like he was cute and furry (and I am not a snake lover at all.  No way I'd do this) and trying to train him to stay off the furnature. It was so real, that I came out to the living room and made sure the big aquarium he arrived in in the dream was not sitting on the coffee table. I have NO idea where this came from.  None. ",

So time passed and I got busy dealing with my Mom's health crises (she has MS, lives with me and is not doing too well)  So when I wen in to the Dr. last month for something else altogether, she told be I was way overdue for my follow up, should have gone in in Feb 2011.  What follow up I ask?  Eek.It's now Feb 2012. So off I go for another mamogram, they didn't like the looks of it at all, did an ultra sound, liked the look of that even less, did a needle biopsy right then and there.  Sent me home telling me they'd call as soon as they had the results, probably tomorrow by noon.  And sure enough, I had calls from the radiology practice, from my dr, from the dr who did the biopsy, and from the cancer navigator at the ocology practice I didn't yet know I was a patient of all by the time morning coffee break rolled around.  It was a shock, but not really a surprise if you know what I mean.   We did an MRI later in the week then off to see a surgeon, and an ocologist (and the cancer navigator) just for Q&A sessions.  I had a lumpectomy on March 1 and am waiting on the oncutype dx results before we decided about chemo.   I feel like I've somehow steped onto a rollar coaster and don't know when, or where, or if, it'll stop.

And we trucked along.  If he attempted to cross in front of me I stuck the pole out to stop him, reminded him, rightside... last thing I need is to get wrapped up in his leash.  After a couple of very small bumps he got the idea and stayed on the right side. (I don't want him heeling on my left because he comes way to close and would precipitate a disaster.)  Quite a nice little workout.  I believe I will dig out that old skijourning kit so he can trot on ahead, he seems to really love the relatively faster pace I'm able to maintain with the poles (still no 4 minute mile mind you, about 10 minutes for 1/4 mile with a couple stops to sniff and such, whereas without the poles it takes about 17 minutes to cover the same ground)",

I think I was primed for problems and the LX and rads just pushed me over the top.  When I had my LX with SNB the surgeon removed 6 extra nodes because they \"looked funny\" but when we found no cancer, I was so relieved that I didn't question what \"looked funny\" meant.  I do wonder if we went and took a node elsewhere, would it \"look funny\" too?  Not that I'm signing up for such an experiment.",

They do have rubber feet that the 12 year old at the store said were for floors and concrete.  If you take the paws off you apparently get better traction... so who knows. Purple, I wear my gear when I work.  It's usually my sleeve with a gauntlet or glove, and a variety of shapewear which is mostly cover by my clothing.  Sometimes it's just an underarmour shirt with something on my hand.  Very few people ask at work. (I'm on a college campus so I interact with 100's of people some weeks)  I'm also a librarian so I'm used to providing information and it goes against the grain to provide incomplete or misleading information...so when they ask I tell them.  And depending on my mood and how close I am to the person the ammount of details vary.  At the least, I'll say \"you know how sometimes your ankles swell? Well my arm does that.\" If they follow up with \"Why does it do that?\"  I'll tell them that some people are just born that way, others have surgery or an injury that damages their lymph system.  If the persist I show them how to search for journal articles about the condition.  At the most, I give them a blow by blow description of my trials and tribulations this past year.  Followed up with a reminder to get that mamogram/colonoscophy/psa whatever. Serves 'em right for being nosey. When I'm out and about and a stranger asks I generally just say I had surgery and leave it at that.  I'm pretty good at a cold hostile stare if anyone persists in rude personal questions.",

Which is why I don't wear the UA shirt unless I really hike up the compression sleeve, and why I'm looking for a shirt with a longer sleeve. That part of my arm is one of my worst swell spots. I am fine in the morning, but as the day goes on?  My cup runneth over. I know we worry about double compression, but I think for my upper are, a gap is worse.  Today I wore the long sleeve Eastbay shirt with no compression sleeve.  When I get home I'll measure and see how far I've drifted from my target diameter.  Carol - Only a little rolling at the bottom of the shirt, and none when I tucked it into my slacks and it was plenty long for that.  The sleeves however are quite excessivly long for me.  (I wear a 17\" long sleeve, so yeah my arms are short) I'd guess these sleeves are 21 or 22 inches long)  I'll need to shorten them before I wear them again. Purple - they are heavier than the UA heat gear, but much lighter than the UA cold gear.  Lighter than a standard cotton T-Shirt for sure.  I kind of like the weight, they aren't as transparent as the UA things can be (especially the white) and I would feel OK about wearing them out and about without an additional layer on top, which I pretty much always need with the UA heat gear.  I think the compression in quite satisfactory for me... but as with everything else it's going to depend on how they fit a given individual.  I may try one bra less at home, but I'm reasonably sure I won't like that. I've got a couple of the UA mens 1/2 sleeve shirts on order.  I'll keep you posted.",

The doctor saw me every week, my nurse was always there and ready to talk, the cancer navigator was just around the corner.  I think I'd have felt really adrift if the surgeon had just cut me loose and that had been the end of treatment.  By the time rads were done (well actually the week after, because I had to come in to have my ooozing wounds treated) I was ready to solo.  And with all the problems I had I was able to work full time and only ended up missing a few hours of work over and above the 30 minutes a day that rads took. Now, my skin is a little more tan than it's ever been, and I still have swelling that may be related to rads, but nothing of note.  I wouldn't say it was a walk in the park, but I'd say it's very doable.",

I can understand (do a point) the idea that \"you brought this on yourself and I'm not going to kill myself trying to undo the damage you've done to yoursellf\" but really, where do you draw the line?  It's somewhat easy to throw stones at the guy who is still smoking while draging his breathing aparatus with him.  But what about the cyclist who didn't wear a helmet? The football player (we know that's a dangerous game wtf were you thinking?)  The driver who causes an accident by driving after a 24 hr shift? The woman who knew she was liable to have complications in her pregnacy, or heaven forbid, allowed herself to gain more weight than the doctor recommended.  The  child who fell off of a cliff while running with scisors? The od victim? The people dumb enough to live in tornado alley? Most injuries and illnesses have a lifestyle componant that one could pass judgement on. Heart disease, diabetus and on and on... as far as the rest are concerned? Well if it wasn't lifestyle it was probably genetic and wouldn't we be better off if the genetically week didn't survive to breed? so...  Tell me, wouldn't we be better off without doctors at all?",

But, if all my results end up as good as this, I'll be happy.  I believe doc said that he didn't send anything to the lab so YAY! He does think I should eat more fiber.  I promised to try. To make this somewhat on topic for the thread, I wore my glove and sleeve to make the point that they needed to not stick my arm.  Two of the nurses were cool... the third argued.  Seems that I can't possibly have le if the cancer wasn't in my nodes. What wonderful news. I shall be tossing my garments on the bonfire.",
