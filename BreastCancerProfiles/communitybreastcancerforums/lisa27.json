Bra sports bra? Cami? or nothing? I did not know why he kept me in such a tight bra? Is it to keep the swelling down? Keep the expanders in place? I am wondering what other people have done.  I am going back to the PS in two days but finding this bra to be so annoying. I would appreciate input. Thank you Elisa  Log in to post a reply",
