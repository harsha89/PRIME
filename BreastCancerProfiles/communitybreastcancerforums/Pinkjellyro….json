They attended the chemo class and my daughter, a medical tech at a hospital, cried so hard when the nurse went over the side effects. It was a good opportunity for us to bond as a family and provided common info for them that I have already been researching and learning here from all of you here. I want to send much love and hugs and encouragement to each of you. Wherever you are in thisjourney, know that you are being lifted up every day! Thank you for welcoming me with open arms. ",

I have a chemo class at 8 and infusion begins at 9. I was a nervous wreck because this all came up so quickly and the fear of the unknown had me down emotionally. Growing up, being the youngest of five, I often learned about life just by sitting around the kitchen table and listening to life lived by my older, experienced siblings. Today, I found my way to these boards and found all of you, my honest, kind, sisters in a club none of us really ever wanted to be members of. As I read your posts, I felt like I was sitting around that table once again and gleaning all I can from wiser, braver, more experienced family. Notice I didn't say older, because I think I am older than many of you, lol. 53 in October. Each of you are amazing women and I feel blessed to have found you and to share this kindred experience on a similar time frame. I hope to share more of my experiences leading up to to this moment, but for now, I must try to quiet down this steroid-infused brain and well- hydrated bladder so they will let me rest. We have an hour and a half trip, so I need to hit that shower by 5:30. I want to shave my legs and armpits, so I will have a memorable reference point for the last time I shaved until my hairs grow back in. For the record, I started typing this at 11:50 but my iPad, for some reason, is only showing one letter every 5 seconds, but I have persevered, lolol! Sweet dreamzzz, all",
