Spent about 20 min with doc and 15 min with 2 research nurses and spent 6 and a half hours waiting. i don't mind the waiting, i know that comes with the territory, but why am I so tired after doing nothing? There are 2 phase II clinical trials that I may be a candidate for, one we won't know until I have a biopsy. I had a liver biopsy in Nov, but they have to have a fresh one. The other they can test my old tissue to see if I qualify, but then you need 2 biopsies and lots of visits in the first month. Before I consider those trials, I need to get into to see the targeted therapy clinic (stage 1 trials) to see what they may offer. I am intrigued with the belief here that you should have as much targeted therapy as possible and as early as possible. The onc seemed to think if I went on to the next standard chemo, yes it may keep my cancer at bay for awhile, but my qol would only go down especially concerning fatigue. He feels the more chemo you get the more fatigued you will become and thus lower qol. With targeted therapies, the issues are much different.  He would have suggested getting a biopsy to map my genome (thus knowing what targeted therapies may work) after 2 standard chemos have failed. Four have failed me so far. My frustration is that none of my next appts are made yet. I need to wait to hear when I have CT/PET, appt with tageted therapy clinic and possibly a biopsy. God knows when all that may happen. You know I want those appts yesterday! On a lighter note, we have met lot of nice people here from all over. It's like coming to the cancer mother land and I am with my people. Wigs, ports and other various contraptions sticking out of body parts abound. We had a very nice dinner at a mexican/cuban restaurant in Rice Village. The van driver recommended it and the plantains( and the mojito) were fabulous.  Thanks for all the advice. Fill you in tomorrow. Need to find some mindless television (Housewifes??) and forget about cancer for a bit. Suzanne ",

I never would have found my way around without her and she gave me such good advice. She came to meet us between appts and we ended up going to the Targeted Therapy Clinic together for our appts. We have the same doctor who is wonderful. That clinic is truly amazing. They have 100 clinical trials going on there. All based on targeting your tumor. Yes, they are phase 1 which is scary, but a lot of times they are using proven drugs but in different ways. It just makes so much sense to do things this way rather than just one chemo after the other. I wish clinics like this were available everywhere. Dr Wheler actually suggested to me the same trial Rachel is on. (arimidex plus everolimus). There has been a lot in the news lately about this drug and it's effectiveness on bc so I am thrilled to try it. Meanwhile, they will test my tumor's genetic info to see what other pathways or targets I may have for other trials in the future. I am so happy not to start another chemo again (at least for awhile). I need to come back on the 19th to start the trial and get my months supply of everolimus. Then monthly visits which won't be easy, but if it is working I will do it!  Rachel and her wonderful husband Clint were so kind to offer to take my husband and I to dinner to get some great mexican food. (Hard to find in CT!). The fajitas (and the company) were out of this world. I've never been to a place where they make their own tortillas. We fly home tomorrow. I definitely feel this trip was worth all the hassle. MD Anderson is a unique and amazing place. Thank you so much Rachel and Clint for your kindness and hospitality. I am so happy to have been able to meet you. I get to see my kids tomorrow! Yeah! Suzanne ",

If you wait until it is very painful, the antibiotic will still take care of it. If you are on a med that is working, it will work whether you have one spot or 3. Getting it earlier if there is no real danger, will not make a difference in the end and may cause you to use up your options earlier than needed.

As many others have told me, you have entered a marathon. There is no finish line in the near future. You are now living with cancer. I have had mets since the beginning 3 and a half years ago. I kept waiting for it to be over and move on and go back to my old life. I realized that I needed to accept that this was my life now. And how much of that life did I want Cancer to control? It will take as much as you allow it, believe me. How did I want my kids (4 and6) to see me? I take my meds and go to my appts and feel tired and achey some of the time, but it won't keep me from enjoying my kids and planning vacations and volunteering. I've had to cut back on some things and nap once in awhile. I bought the cupcakes for my son's school B-day party instead of making them like I normally would, but who cares? It is as much if not more difficult for me right now to deal with the psychological burden than the physical stuff. I know things and people that trigger me and I avoid them. I also believe denial is a good thing to a certaine extent. You will find your way through this and you will be happy again. Hang in there.

They already had all my doctor's notes. I asked my onc today at my appt and she said she doesn't do chemo flow sheets. She showed me how at every visit the notes begin with my current meds, past chemos etc. The coordinator said to me it is very \"unusual\" that my doctor doesn't do them. OK, so what am I supposed to do? My doctor DOESN\"T do them!! I ended up having my chemo nurse send a copy of her notes from every visit that I had chemo. Another 86 pages of notes. God, please let this be enough info for them to finally give me a &^*#^& appt!!!!! Sorry to vent, but I just want to know when I can go so I can book flight, get kids to grandparents, dog to kennel etc etc. I'll keep u all up to date on my saga. Suzanne ps Fitz, I do go to Dana Farber but they have nothing to offer me now other than the standard treatments and i am looking for a clinical trial or something novel. I have had a lot of chemo in the past 2 years and soon I won't qualify for many trials because of too many lines of treatment.Phase 1 's often don't limit lines of treatment, but I don't know that I am ready to consider a phase 1.",

I asked when she was diagnosed and she said \"1986\" then I asked when she was diagnosed as metastatic and she said \"1986!\". I nearly fell off my chair! She was in her 30's then and knew she had a lump but no one thought anything of it. She then started having back pain and went to a chiropractor. When she still didn't improve she went to a spine surgeon who did an x-ray and saw something and finally the lump was excised and found to be BC. She had her ovaries removed, radiation and hormonals. She now has several small bone mets, but nothing urgent and gets zometa. In 1986 she was told she had 18mos to live. It just totally made my day talking with her and I wanted to share with you all.

Getting that local proclamation and telling your hometown newspaper, radio or TV station your story will further heighten awareness of metastatic disease.        MBCN has prepared an informational packet designed to make it easy for you to contact your mayor's office to get METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AWARENESS DAY proclaimed in your city.

My DD is pretty good about talking to me, asking Q's etc. I always reassure her that she is loved by many many people.She will always be taken  care of. Mommy and her doctors are doing everything they can to keep me healthy, but I will always have cancer and be on treatment. I am starting to realize how closely she watches me and she seems to get anxious if I am in pain or need to rest. This puts more pressure on me not to show how I feel. Ugh. My son is the enigma.He nevers talks about it, but has major anxiety issues this school year and constantly complains of stomach pains and not wanting to eat.He's been checked out by the pedi and a gastro pedi  doc who say he is OK. What am I to think now other than it is his anxiety causing his symtoms? He has started to see the school social worker and I am looking for a child psych dr. As if we don't suffer enough in our own pain? Knowing the anxiety and pain it is causing my kids is just too much.  I will take any pain, any meds side effects etc. just please please leave my kids out of it.
