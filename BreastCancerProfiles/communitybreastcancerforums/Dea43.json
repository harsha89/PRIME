They feel sore though and 'exposed' like an open wound. My onc says nothing, dry skin, put lotion on it. My hair is just about 2\" long now on the return growth. The hair clumps funny at these locations too. I have been looking around the boards here, but have not found the same problem. I read about some having pimples... These are not pimply. I thought maybe a SE of Tamoxifen or the Zometa.. I have no other location of excessive dry skin. Anyone with any thoughts or knowledge on this, I thank you now. No one fights alone!

I hate thinking that everything I put in my mouth is bad for me. So I can't enjoy the foods I like and the 'cancer fighting' foods are a chore to convert to right now. But, like curveball I am on the fence. I have six kids, my youngest is three months old, it pisses me off that I don't really know what to do to be here for him in 10 or 20 years. If I change my diet do I stand a better chance? I don't see myself making that change 100% with my family either, so my few treats.. Will that harm everything I work for? Is a little ice cream cutting another year off my life each time? I actually had ice cream after one of my last chemo treatments and it tasted terrible, so I have been able to avoid it for a while. But I have always enjoyed it... And was hoping to do so again one day. I don't think our food would be such an issue if the dang government didn't allow all the crap that is done to our foods, animals etc. Sorry to go on. But this food thing is a current problem for me.",

Then I stay away for a bit. But I appreciate these boards so much because no one out here really gets it and that makes me sad too. Being somewhat newer here, Soliel is my first loss. I did not speak with her personally here, seen her on the boards... but amazed how touched I am by the news. Spamgirl really said it well.",
