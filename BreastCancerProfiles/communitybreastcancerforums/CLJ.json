    "Content": "CLJ wrote: I had my ultrasound guided needle biopsy yesterday and it was VERY painful when the radiologist tried to inject the Lidocaine into the mass.  It actually brought me to tears and I can usually take a lot of pain.  He told me it was very unusual.  Has anyone else had this happen?  He actually had to take the biopsies from around the edges and said the center of the mass would actually push the biopsy tool to the side.   Has anyone else had this happen?  This is a  very small spiculated mass with irregular edges.
