Also got neulasta shot 3 days after. She needs 3 more rounds then mastectomy, then more chemo and/or radiation. This first round hit her hard. She has diverticulitis pain, diarrhea, vomiting - all started day after neulasta shot - day three or so and she is getting worse. She has been hospitalized for the past three days for low white cell count, to manage pain and burning in colon. Her counts went up but still so miserable. Before this she has had other issues -  fibromyalgia, ibs, 2 back surgeries ect. so I think chemo is also making these alignments worse. Is this all normal or  should we talk to onco to change cocktail? She has already made up her mind to quit but she is also very depressed from this right now. Log in to post a reply",

She had a rough three nights and even coded the other night after a reaction to a blood pressure medication. I was almost on her side about stopping because it was so scary. Her onco dr. said he will lower the dose and possibly change the cocktail but she is still not trusting them so much. I will ask about the Neupogen - I did not know there was an alternate to Neulasta and I think that is what did her in this time.",
