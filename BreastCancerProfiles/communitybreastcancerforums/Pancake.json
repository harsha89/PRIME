About 4-6 weeks ago I turned over in bed and felt the most horrific pain in my right breast, unlike anything I'd ever felt before, sort of being stabbed and wrenched all at the same time. I brushed it off but felt that something wasn't quite right. I had a few more sharp pain incidents but not to the same intensity. I couldn't feel or see anything suspicious so put it out of my mind albeit that my breast was tender. Four days ago I noticed a clear dimple above the nipple. It's pretty obvious and is even worse if I put my arms up, bend over or manipulate the breast in anyway because then it's more like a mini crater. I also felt distinct hardening in a fairly large area immediately at the site of and above the dent. I went to see my GP yesterday. She said she could see and feel what I could and has immediately referred me to the breast clinic at my local hospital. Apparently it's a one stop shop - they do a mammogram, ultra sound and biopsy all in one day. Problem is that I've at least a 2 week wait. I honestly don't think I have two weeks in me. I know something is wrong, I've scared myself stupid googling and I'm now not sleeping due to fear. Any advice? I'm 45, no relevant history of any kind.

The point you make about the benign ones not sticking around to write about it is a good one. In my head I've jumped so many stages, it's torture. I'm glad it all gets done in one day. My GP said they should be able to give me an idea of what they think on the day but the biopsy results will take a little time. I haven't told my family as I don't want them to worry unnecessarily so I'm feeling very alone right now and boy is time dragging. I'm sorry that you don't have a clear answer yet - that must be very frustrating and worrying.  ",
