Keeping also positive attitude helps you get through this and any, hopefully mild, SEs.  Push water and depending on what you are getting consider taking something like senna pills daily for a few days to prevent constipation at the earliest sign of that. I waited 4 days and had a bad time trying to catch up. Second round I started the day after chemo to prevent it.  Ask you MO if constipation will be a SE of what you are getting.  For those having a lot of emotional swings. Consider a short course of an antidepressant. I was always a very anti pill person. Only took vit D before all this. I had a real problem with anxiety and  depressed mood for 2-3 weeks after diagnosis to the point of anorexia( losing some weight was actually a plus).  Started on a low dose of generic lexapro and now I feel so much better. Positive attitude all the way now. I will cont the meds until finishing up all my treatments and wean off  in the summer.  Best to all having chemo this week, last dose of AC on Thurs for me.  Barbara",

My counts on AC went low so that I stayed away from my office pretty much the whole 8 to 10 weeks when I was on it. On taxol my counts it never dropped below normal so far. Last week my white blood count was 4.1 so I'm holding my breath that tomorrow for Taxol  number 9 it stays above normal. I returned to work after my second taxol when I knew my white count was holding steady and I felt well enough to work. I have gotten the premed decadron reduced to 5 mg ( hopefully 4 tomorrow) and the benedryl to 25 mg.  I worry about all the steroids increasing bone loss and the taking AIs after that also cause bone loss.  At least by getting the premed meds reduced I feel like I have some control over my treatment.  Another hint that I posted on the December chemo ladies is that if you using EMLA cream put it on about an hour and a half ahead of time and then cover with about 4 in square of Glad press and seal, this works much better than using plain plastic wrap. It keeps the cream right over the port and is less messy Barbara",

Trying one senna pill a day starting day of chemo. I hope this works smoother the waiting 3 days and chasing after it. I found great gummy fiber chews also.  My public hair stated to fall out before head hair.  Funny I lost about half of the lower hair and it stopped falling out ( for now). My head hair really was lost from day 17-19. I was left with whispy sparse hair that my 20 yr old son said made me look like a Chucky Doll. I left him shave it down with a clipper. Felt and looked better.  I did get the most beautiful wig at the American cancer Society. They will give you a wig and several turbans. I also am signed up for the Looking Good-Feeling Better make up class. It was reschedule twice due to weather and then to the leader being sick so hope to go on the 27th. I hear wonderful things about this class.  Just had my third AC yesterday. Yeah 3/4 done.   My MO says the weekly Taxol is easy compared to AC.  I work in a three doctor primary care medical office so I decided it was not safe for me to work during the AC cycles whe my WBC go so low. Middle of cold and flu season and too many sick patients coming in. I do telecommute and talk to patients by phone and can do quit a bit from home. I hope to get back at least 3 days a week whe taxol sarts.  BTW I found generic Claritin works great for the neulasta pain. I start the day of chemo and continue for 4 more days. Other them some aching in my lower neck and head aches  it seems to work. My WBC went from 1.0 a week ago to 10 yesterday so the Claritin is not interfering with the efficacy just the pain.  paloverde  - look into patient assistance programs for the Emmend.  Try this link to start. http://www.emend.com/aprepitant/emend/consumer/as...

Not deep pink like my friends regular nails but they look like I painted then a light whitish pink. They are still growing and I just trimmed them yesterday. Still stuck down to the nail bed, not flaking or lifting but just very pale looking, I know my hemoglobin is in the upper 10's so it is not pale from anemia.  I keep them covered with a clear nutrient polish.  Funny the toe nails look normal.  Another taxol down today (#10). I drove myself to and from the CTC.  With the lower dose of Benedryl I  am not drowsy. Luckily I only live 5 blocks away. I figured if I was to dopy to drive I would walk home and walk back later in the evening to pick up my car. But I was fine. I actually enjoyed being there by myself.  I visited with a friend who was there for her last chemo for lymphoma. She brought the nurses cookies today. Read the newspaper and a book on IPad. Also got 4 phone calls from friends who all wanted to know if I needed a ride home. It was nice to have some quiet time.   Barbara",

Now just the fatigue from rads.  I think my morning achiness is the aromasin. Better once I am up and moving around. Best advice I have is to get out walking as much as possible. Makes everything feel better.  The best thing is now when I blow my nose in the morning no more blood or bloody chunks.  8 weeks PFC I think I have enough hair to go out sans wig or scarves now.  Too bad it is so white/gray. ",

No problems taking both together but I would be careful with Percocet and Ativan together.  Both can cause central nervous system depression.  Sitting in the infusion enter just finished the premeds and waiting to get the 4th and final AC. Start taxol in 2 weeks.  Already ordered L glut amine and B6 from Amazon.  Good luck to all getting chemo today and tomorrow. Remember the Claritin before and after the neulasta shot. It really works.  Barbara",

Chemo brain to the point of not being able to concentrate to read expect a short magazine article.   I slept 4 hours this afternoon. Luckily my sister is visiting for 2 weeks and she is doing all the cooking. I think some of it is the chemo drugs having their effect and part the  decadron withdrawal.  It does improve over the next few days.    Just happy I finished round #4 of AC and start taxol in 2 weeks.  Hope to get back to work a few days per week, really unable to work thorough the AC due to being in a medical office full of sick people all the time.  Hope my WBC holds on taxol so I can go back.  Barbara",

Clear head, little pain but nothing Advil does not help. I actually feel like I have saliva in my mouth again!  I am taking B6 and L glutamine to try to lessen neuropathy risk also.  Hope your port works better next time. Did they get it working for the infusion finally? Desimone My WBC went low on on AC  reaching a low of about 1,000 (ANC 300-400 each time) one week after chemo but the neulasta brought it back to 8-10 the second week. On taxol weekly my WBC did not drop after the first dose. It was stable at 8.1 today, Hg stable at 10.5 so far. With time I expect the counts to drift down but my MO does not feel it will go as low as with the AC.  Barbara",
