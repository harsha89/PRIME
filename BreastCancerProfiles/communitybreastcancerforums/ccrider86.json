I am currently not doing them anymore until I know what is going on with me. My left breast is sore, heavy and the best way I know how to explain it, it feels like when you have been away from your baby and you know its time to get home and breast feed. This breast is also having bloody discharge. I had a mammogram and it came back as they wanted to do further tests. I went back today and they did a more extensive mammogram and an ultrasound. The radiologist said both were ok. My primary care physician took a sample of the blood from my nipple and sent it down to the lab and made me an appointment with a surgeon for tomorrow. His philosophy is any bloody nipple discharge is cancer until proven otherwise. My gut feeling that there is more to this than just blood in my nipple. I also have some white bumps underneath both breasts. My question is has anyone else experienced these symptoms and what are the questions I need to ask the surgeon tomorrow? I appreciate all your help. Waiting for your replys. Log in to post a reply",
