To clarify, the radiologist is the one suggesting IBC on the initial imaging reports. I had never even heard of it. The doctors have told us to prepare for a diagnosis. If the biopsy comes back negative they have said they will just go back for more. The radiologist said that if there were malignant cells present than you would expect the biopsy sample to sink in the solution. He said the fact it floated means it may not be cancer (which he said he would be very surprised if it wasn't) but more likely they need to biopsy another area. Fatty breast tissue will float etc . The unknown is so hard to deal with and I guess I'm just trying to gather as much info as I can to feel like I'm doing something.",
