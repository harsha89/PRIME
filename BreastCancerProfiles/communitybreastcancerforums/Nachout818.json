      "Content": "Apr 20, 2016 11:35AM - edited Apr 20, 2016 05:16PM by Nachout818 Hi ElleD, So sorry that you find yourself here but you are among friends and supporters. I had my lumpectomy and breast reduction/balancing on March 22. The surgery was easier than I expected and I am recovering well.. After surgery, came the decision making as to what treatment to have. I had an Oncotype Test done and of course I landed right in the middle of the intermediate range at 25.. I went to the Mo and heard what he had to say as he laid everything out on the table for me Basically he told me that if I chose chemo that would drop the recurrence rate from 12% to 9%. After careful consideration and discussion with my husband and children I decide not to go forward with the chemo because I felt that the 3& difference was not enough .. There are many women who will do chemo even if there is a 1% difference but for me the difference was not enough.. Instead of focusing on the 12% chance of recurrence I am looking at the 88% chance that it won't come back.. My Mo said that if I chose to just do radiation and AI that would be a reasonable decision...  It was a tough decision to make but I am comfortable with my choice and won't look back... Your treatment options are YOUR choice and once you have all the information needed you will make the decision that is right for YOU! I wish you peace and clarity moving forward.... Feel free to private message me if you care to talk.. Diane",

Before I arrived at the hospital I applied EMLA cream to the area.. At the time of the procedure I was given an injection of Lidocaine. My team was wonderful and I did not feel anything at all.. I was seated the whole time... The worst part of the procedure was not the insertion of the wires but sitting in the uncomfortable position in the mammogram machine. I forgot to mention that I also took a Xanax before arriving at the hospital which really kept me calm. I think that staying calm is also key. Good Luck and feel free to private message me if you have more questions or want more information",

My tumors were Estrogen positive 100% and Progesterone Positive 49% and 77% The samples sent were from the biopsy and no mention was made of another test being done with the surgically removed tissues. Sentinel node biopsy will take place during surgery on March 22 . I am trying to remain optimistic about no node involvement because I have been told by several that the mammogram, sonogram and physical exam indicates no involvement at this time. I will be going for the lode injection the day before and was given a prescription for EMLA cream to apply before hand . Any advice needed for that procedure? Then the day of my surgery will be have a wire localization, what scares me too. I am waiting for the results of the BRCA test which hopefully will be in by the end of the week... Needless to say I am a nervous wreck and getting the Oncotype results today just added to my already elevated anxiety level... Xanax will be my are best friend. Thanks for all of your advice, encouragement and support.... Any other info you can impart will be greatly appreciated. ",

I opted for a lumpectomy with breast reconstruction and breast reduction on the opposite side for symmetry... I would have preferred to have the surgery sooner but this was the first available date that both my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon were available.. I also wanted the first appointment of the day for these reasons: 1) if I had to wait until later in the day my anxiety levels would have gone through the roof. 2) I wanted both doctors and all supportive staff fresh 3) since fasting was required after midnight did not want to wait all day without eating and 4) wanted to be able to have same day surgery and if surgery started late in the day I would not have had to have stayed in the hospital over night which I did not want to do... I asked the breast surgeon if it was more important to do it sooner and she said it didn't matter in my case since it was contained and not going anywhere Obviously each case is different so it is best to discuss this with your doctor.

I have my first consultation with a surgeon this Friday and then another for a second opinion on Tuesday March 1.

I don't understand the rest of the pathology report so that part will have to wait until Friday. I was involved in a horrific car accident 8 years ago which resulted in the amputation of my left leg up to the hip.. As a result I am VERY serious about NOT having another part of my body removed... I am wondering if I would still be a candidate for a lumpectomy since I have 3 tumors largest being 1.6 cm and the others much smaller..
