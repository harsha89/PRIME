Last week I went for my annual exam (I hadn't had an annual in 7 years) and during the breast examination the ARNP found a dense mass in my left breast. She ordered a mammogram along with an ultrasound which I had done Thursday 4/11. I'm waiting for the results and trying not to worry, but it's like asking me not to look at the pink elephant in the room.  Any advice, words of wisdom are truly appreciated.

Findings showed a cyst, no further testing or anything needed. Told to keep an eye out, but as for now wall is well.  Love and prayers for all still waiting. ",
