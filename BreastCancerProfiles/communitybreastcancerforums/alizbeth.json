I don't blame you for being nervous about changing the dressings.  I would have been also, but fortunately, my husband did it for me the first few days to week.  After that, I got used to it and did it myself.  I changed the dressings just once a day and emptied my drains 3x a day initially. Hope all goes well.",

I had a BMX, with immediate tissue expander placement, on a Tuesday.  I had completely stopped the pain meds by Sunday.  I was sore following the surgery, but not true pain.  I could walk and get around quite well.  In fact, I went on several short walks a day (doctor's orders) by 2nd day at home.  The drains were a bother, but didn't hurt.  One set was out in 1 week; 2nd in 2 weeks.  I was working from home on the 3rd day (just a couple of hours) and back at work just under 2 weeks post-surgery.  Mostly, I was more tired than usual. I took afternoon naps the first few days at home, and went to bed quite early (8:30pm) for a good week following the surgery. Getting up from bed was the only issue that was truly difficult.  Many people and doctors recommend sleeping in a recliner the first days or weeks following your surgery.  We didn't have a recliner, so I did not.  But, this would have been nice.  I did stack my pillows so I was elevated, but getting out of bed was definitely the hardest aspect. Good luck.  I hope all goes well.",
