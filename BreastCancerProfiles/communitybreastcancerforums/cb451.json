Regarding skin cream, my RO gave me a tub of \"Udderly Smooth Udder Cream.\"  Yes, it's for cows!  I thought you might enjoy the directions:  \"Apply to the udder after each milking, massaging into the skin.  For teat cracks apply in sufficient quantity to fill crack and cover surrounding area.  Apply uniformly to chafed area and bruises to maintain skin suppleness.  For aid in softening swollen udders following calving, apply liberally twice daily with gentle massage.\"  MOO!",

My breast looks tanned, sometimes pink, and the skin is sensitive, but no blistering.  The \"Udderly Smooth\" bovine cream seems to be working.  FYI it's quickly absorbed so there is no tacky or sticky mess.  I too have gone the \"George Costenza\"  fashion route:  no bra (36C, only somewhat uncomfortable) and tees under hoodies.  When I need to look \"presentable,\" I have a few cotton bras without underwires from Victoria's Secret.  I also have a  stretchy thing left over from nursing days, and a few sports bras.  Otherwise I'm trying to keep my skin lubricated and in fesh air.  For those of you who, like me, felt tired from the very first session, my RO (whom I adore) theorized the fatigue was caused by my skin healing rapidly.  She also was very reassuring about the emotional aspects of cancer, stating that no matter what the prognosis, it's a profound and life-altering event.  I have been struggling with squaring my professional identity (litigator) with my present reality. I have worked at the same job for over 14 years, putting in extensive overtime.  Now I'm taking time off to get through treatment.  A collegaue called me about one of my cases and, after cajoling chitchat (\"we all miss you/are thinking of you\"/etc.) he said \"Do you mind if I ask what you do all day?\"  Then \"Why are you so tired?\"  I was floored and inexplicably guilty.  I look normal and fit!  Anyway, she really helped ground me.  The depression, anxiety, guilt, it's all normal for what we are going through.  I hope this helps others who are feeling wonky too. Does anyone else feel naseous?  In addition to fatigue, I am experiencing waves of naseau throughout the day.  It's almost like I have the flu but no fever.  Yuck.",

The treatment SEs are really crazy.  Anyone else having dry eyes?  Hot flashes awaken me every night, but now I have trouble prying opening my eyes, and they're bright red in the morning.  My RO suggested eye moisturizing drops, but didn't relate it to BC treatment.  Then I had my teeth cleaned, and the oral hygienist asked if I was experiencing dry mouth as a SE of radiation.  I told her about the dry eyes and she said it makes sense - salivary glands can dry up during radiation, making the patient more prone to cavities, so why not the eyes?   I need to buy those drops. Following up on my earlier posts re nauseau: My RO believes it's caused by the constant stress to the body from the radiation.  She suggested Pepcid AC, which has been working  - yeah!  I also have an itchy, blistering rash on my chest.  1% hydrocortisone cream did not quell the itch, so now I'm trying Benadryl gel.  My breast remains pink throughout the day but usually returns to normal color the next morning. All  structural garments are really iritating me now so I've given up on them.  Just cotton tees and hoodies now. I am profoundly tired in the late afternoon/evening, which makes me irritable and snappy.  Usually at the people I love the most, simply by virtue of proximity.  I have been apologizing to my family a lot lately!  I therefore try to be productive in the a.m., before I crash.  Nothing as vigorous as some of you gals, but I am walking/jogging my little terriers at the Rose Bowl after my 9:30 a.m. treatements. My MO is waiting until I complete radiation before starting me on Tamoxifin.  If I recall correctly, his reasoning was simply that he did not want to overwhelm me. The radiation patients at my facility are scheduled so that I rarely see anyone else besides the next one after me, but I have occasionally seen other patients.  Most are significantly older women (I'm 50).  And no staff \"eye candy\" anywhere!  But very lovely, kind caregivers.  I can see that I'm lucky for that. I hope you are all doing as well as possible!  I am very glad to have your company.
