Another Dr said it was a strained muscle and that I had fibrocystic breasts.The ultrasound came back normal. That was back in Jan. Then a couple weeks ago, I noticed a red spot on breast, above nipple. It was hardened. It looked bruised. No pain. And it was fevered. It also dimpled in. I went to Dr, she ordered a mammogram, it came back birad 0. Went for an ultrasound, they said it is most likely a breast infection and have me currently on an antibiotic. I go back on October 28th, if antibiotics do not work then they stated that further testing would be required so they could exclude inflammatory carcinoma. they also stated they compared to last ultrasound and it was grossly stable. Which this hardened spot was not there in Jan. I also have very dense breasts. But if its the same then why would they not have put me on antibiotics then? I am very confused.Â  Has anyone else had this problem?Â  Im so worried. Please help. Thank you!ðŸ˜Š Log in to post a reply",
