    "Content": "Tropix711 wrote: Hi all, I am new here and waiting on a mammogram that is scheduled for Monday. I went to the doctor with itchy nipples that peel and sometimes get raw at the base of the nipple (when I itch them too much mostly). The peeling looks like they have been sun burned. I have the problem on both sides, sometimes one side will be worse and the next day they switch sides. They have been this way for a few months now. I had done some research before my appt and knew of Pagets but I never really expected my dr to suggest it. I am only 25 and I have a one year old son. My question is has anyone been diagnosed with pagets on both sides? I know there is a multitude of other things it could be but I have never had any other skin problems other than some eczema when I was really young. I am so scared but finding this board was such a blessing. Log in to post a reply",
