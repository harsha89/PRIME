Today I feel sore all over with a bruise where I landed, even the breast where I had a lumpectomy is achy. Anyone have any thoughts? I've fallen before in my life & not felt as sore.

I was sent to PT which helped a lot, she used something that looks like a shoehorn just gently massaging it and the pain was gone. I went back 1 more time and didn't notice any difference so that was it for me. Now it's sore again but I can easily live with it.",
