I have been lactating for almost 11 (yes eleven) years. Even when not nursing milk never fully dried up. Here is why I am concerned. I am a newly post partum, currently breast feeding mom. About a week and a half after the birth I found a lump on the outside edge of my areola. I describe it as a deep lump bc it feels deep in my tissue. It feels about the size of a round needle head. It does not hurt. It does not move. Initially I though clogged milk duct. I massaged it, did heat packs, had baby nurse on that side, pumped that side till empty. Talked to a lactation specialist about it. Basically did everything I could to clear the lump. Nothing worked. It is still there. In all my years nursing and having encountered mastits I have not felt a lump or tissue in my breast like this spot. I see my ob for my 6 week post partum check up on Wednesday. I plan to discuss it with her. Has anyone ever encountered this before? I am trying hard to not over react. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
