      "Content": "JDG wrote: Hi - I am a 37 year old woman - no children.  I have been seeing a breast surgeon since I was 32 given a very strong family history of breast cancer.  My mother had breast cancer when she was 37 years old and had a mastectomy and given tamoxofin (was part of clinical trial!).  Then, 20 years later, at the age of 57, my mother was diagnosed with metastatic stage IV breast cancer and sadly passed away one month after her 60th birthday.  That was five years ago.  My paternal and maternal grandmothers have had breast cancer, as have a bucket full of aunts on my mom's side.  So that's the history. I have been getting routine mammograms and MRIs for the last 5 years.  Mammos have always shown that I have extremely dense breasts but really nothing else.  MRIs for the most part have shown scattered paratheylm (spelling) foci in both breasts along with some small calcifications and cysts.  Nothing my breast surgeon has been concerned with and nothing which required additional testing. I was a bit late in getting my MRI this last time (went 18 months instead of 12 months).  I just got back the results and am a little nervous - I thought maybe someone could help me understand what it all means... I am sure my doctor will call me this week (MRI was done with and without contrast): RESULTS: There is a nodular area of enhancements in the right breast at 4:00 mid-depth measuring 1.3 cm with type I kinetics.  There is also a stippled area of enhancement in the left breast at 3:00, far posterior, with type I/II kintetics.  Small high signal lesions are seen bilaterally on T2w images, likley cysts or other benign lesions. There is no adenopathy. OK - is there anyone out there who can help me understand?  I did not have any of this on my last MRI which was done in December of 2008. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

I so appreciate it.   So today I had my follow up appointment - bilateral ultrasound and more bilateral mammogram images.  The radiologist came to speak me with after and said that neither area can be seen on the ultrasounds or mammo's.... only visible on the MRI.  Suggested  bilateral MRI-guided biopsies.  Right breast has area that will be easily accessed.  Left breast has area located far posterior - this concerns me because I remember when my mom's breast cancer came back, the lump was found to be close to her chest wall - exactly where doctor said mine is.  Does anyone know if the location of lumps are hereditary?  Just curious... So I will have both biopsies done in 2 1/2 weeks....  If anyone has any experience or insight or information, I would be appreciative if you can share.  Thank you all so much!",
