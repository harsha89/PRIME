      "Content": "Caeryn23 wrote: I had a MRI in March 2009. The left breast showed 1 area of clumped enhancement, and 1 area of segmental clumped enhancement. The MRI core biopsy of both areas were benign. They put 2 clips/tissue markers in.  My MRI from this month showed the same two enhancements (same locations) from March. The first area was a little larger than before. The recent mammogram showed clustered microcalcifications in the second area. If it is fibrocystic changes, would the same two areas still be there from 7 months ago? What would cause the recent changes? Thanks in advance.  Log in to post a reply",

It's somewhat thick, browinish, and clearish. It doesn't happen all the time. I also have swelling in that breast. Could it still be an infection or something else? Can they do a ductogram if I don't have discharge at the doctor's office? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

It also says there are \"predominantly extensively sclerotic breast parenchmya with sparse scattered benign ducts and lobules.\" The gross description says, \"the rubbery consistency of the tissue extends to all 6 inked margins.\" Are any of these proliferative changes? What does sclerotic mean? What does the margin part mean? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
