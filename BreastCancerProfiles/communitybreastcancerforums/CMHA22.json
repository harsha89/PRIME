As far as we know this is the only tumor that exists. She's also doing 10 days of radiation followed by 2-3 months of chemo, once per week. Is it possible for the radiation to shrink the tumor(s) completely in someone with spinal bone mets or is it simple to shrink them or control pain? Thanks for your response :) CM",

She was having back pain and went in and they found the mass. The biopsy just confirmed cancer. Looking for some hope. I'm terrified. \"Dr Google\" is making this all sound so horrible. She feels fine. Is rarely sick has had clear mammograms for years and still does. Clear blood work ups. Any feedback will be helpful. What can we expect now? She will meet with the oncologist tomorrow morning. Thanks in advance and thoughts with everyone going through this. <3 CM Log in to post a reply",

TheDivineMrsM - We will hopefully find out today what kind of treatment. I'll keep you posted.  Kaymic- The information found on the internet is terrifying. The 2 year life span average is making me sick to my stomach. So glad to see that maybe that's not how this is going to be.",

The tumor isn't surgically removable b/c it has affected some of the bone in her vertebrae. The Dr. said that the cancer found in her spine is totally different than the bc she had 19 years ago which is fairly unusual. He also said it is not hormone reactive which is opposite of what she had the first go around. She was treated after surgery/chemo with tamoxofin but obviously this time around that wouldn't help.  Does anyone have any information about hormone receptor negative bone mets? Will there be drugs after chemo?  Thanks, CM",

      "Content": "Mar 29, 2016 09:18PM - edited Mar 29, 2016 09:25PM by CMHA22 has anyone had SBRT done for bone mets? Any success? My mother was just diagnosed with a single bone met to her T1 in her spine. I don't know the exact measurement of it but they have said \"it's small\" so they are going to go ahead with the SBRT. She's has several CT's and MRI's and the doctors have yet to find any other cancer in her body detectable by those scans. She is scheduled for a bone scan on Friday so I am praying nothing else pops up. My Mom was at 19 years remission and now we are in this living hell again after all this time. She's been healthy all these years so this news is devastating and so hard to digest. She is having the SBRT treatments beginning next week with a goal of three sessions but potentially up to five. She'll then follow with Taxol, weekly, for 2-3 months. Just looking for any thoughts on the stereotactic body radiation treatments. Reading these boards gives ,e hope that her life can feel \"normal\" and not completely surrounded by this awful disease. She has so much to live for and we want her as long as we can have her. :(  Thanks, CM",
