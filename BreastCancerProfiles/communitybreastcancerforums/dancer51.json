I\"ll do taxol separately.  3 of AC and 4 of taxol.  I'm so glad I found this.  Someone out there tell me I can do this and get through it.",

(AC+T) ended up with seroma and had to have a minor surgery to drain, irrigate, and culture my right chest area.   I don't like the center I'm going to.  I feel like a number not a person and I'm so tired of thinking cancer!  I'm a person first.  I'm looking for another center where they treat the whole person not just the disease.  I haven't gone back for another treatment and I know I have to do this.   I'm sorry if I sound frustrated but I'm jumping out of my skin with stress.   Thanks for listening Dx 10/21/2007, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 2/8 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
