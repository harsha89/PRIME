I was back at work on Tuesday for a half day, and plan on going in today. The chemotherapy itself wasn't so bad. The Neulasta shot though, took me down. My bones hurt just like I had the flu and it's given me some horrible stomach/bowel issues. Although, I may not continue working due to insurance reasons.",
