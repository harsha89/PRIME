I took lots of Tylenol to supplement. I couldn\u2019t stand pain meds - especially constipation it causes. Not worth it. Best wishes to you for your upcoming surgery. You should have an easier recovery without reconstruction but I can only give an opinion of what I experienced and I weaned off that stuff quickly.",

I\u2019m missing my workouts now that I\u2019m feeling better. That\u2019s fabulous you\u2019re getting your implants soon. Did they say you can\u2019t workout for 4 months once implants are in? Or am I reading that wrong?",
