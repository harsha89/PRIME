Like all of a sudden there is this magic that appeared on my head and like there is going to be a bunch of hair. What is that saying? \"A watch pot never boils\" Well I feel like my head boils several times a day. Who is Cindy Loo who? I guess I will have to look it up.",

I got really upset, he said he was joking, (not funny) At the time it was like eewww really that's who you think of when you see me? Well I am over it now, but I believe that if you think it, than say it out loud, then you mean it. Well what do I expect... We both agreed that casper was a little nicer. Ugggg and then to watch all those hair commercials, for thicker more manageable, hair try blah, blah, blah...Anyway, ladies enjoy you Tuesday. Any of you ladies Master Chef fans?

I am so tired of being bald, having no eyebrows or lashes. I'm not all that to begin with and now, I feeel like I look lile a freak. I know it's vain of me, but enough is enough. I feel ugly all the time, that I don't hardly ever go out. And now I'm worried that the Arimidex will delay my hair growth.  I have heard and read about Biotin, and Hair Surge and even coconut oil. Do they really work or is it just a crock of bs, And is giving false hope? I don't know. Sorry for being so negative, I'm just sick and tired of being sick and tired. You know what I mean? Thanks",
