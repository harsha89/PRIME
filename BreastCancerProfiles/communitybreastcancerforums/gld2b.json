I agree, Irishgirl711, that I knew little about Savi treatment before coming here. I will have to skip a treatment day on July 4, but if all goes well, I'll still only have the device in for one weekend. The RO said I need to sleep with it a night to let it \"settle\" before they do any treatment planning. My first MO appointment is the same day as the insertion, so it will be an eventful day. I will certainly try to share my experience here later to help others.",

I was too nervous beforehand to say it was a breeze, but it really did go well, and it was practically painless. I'm a bit sore now, mostly under the lumpectomy scar, but don't feel I need to take anything for it. I think memories of the stereotactic breast biopsy and tracer injection for the SLNB left me expecting much worse. The BS and his nurse are pleasant and kind, and that really helps. I also like that he calls me \"young lady\" even though I probably have 10 years on him. Yes, I'm taking Keflex, and he threw in some Diflucan just in case. PatsyKB, I will definitely find a way to have my hair washed. It's too thick and I'm too short to do it in the sink, especially without resting my breasts on the counter :) I definitely feel more optimistic about the next 10 days!",

My breast hurts a bit, and sometimes the incision around the device entry hurts, but it is manageable. I am so fortunate that the treatment center is 20 minutes from work and home. I've been going to work in between treatments. Yesterday (Friday), I had TWO vehicles break down on me but each happened after a treatment and not before, which was more than just good luck. If I want to post all the details of my SAVI treatment later for newcomers, should I start a new topic? Don't want to perpetuate too many similar topic threads, but want to make it easy to find. Thank you everyone!",

I took two Percocet before the treatment and had strong pain for about 45 seconds when the device came out, but it abated after that. He put about 12 steri-strips in a pile over the incision, and all but 3 came off when I showered (I held a washcloth over the incision in the shower). The incision is on the right side of my right breast, and on July 9, I was finally able to sleep on that side for a few hours. The incision and surgical cavity have more soreness than I expected, and I have regular stabbing pains through the day, but it's all slowly improving. I felt very unsettled the few days after finishing, I think a letdown from being so consumed by this for weeks and now having to face everything in my daily life I left undone during that time. But I'm slowing feeling better about that also. I gave myself a little break and then took the first Tamoxifen tablet this morning. I'm interested to see how that goes! Next, I need to figure out how to get some exercise. I hate exercising indoors, but this heat means it has to be the indoor track for the next several months. Thank you everyone for your concern and interest.",
