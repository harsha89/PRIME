Hair loss sucks.But it WILL grow back!  Chemo is scary but totally doable.  I never threw up and I did 12 rounds!  I did take Compazine for anti-nausea though. There is a good thread here about what to expect and prepare for before chemo. You are not alone. I wish and pray for quick success for you.  Hugs, Jeannine",

Then by the time I had my 3 scans (they all came out clean Amen) I finally will begin chemo tomorrow.  8/15! But DON'T stress too much.  I thought for sure the cancer had spread all over.  It hasn't. The good thing is you now have a Dr. who is on top of it and is working for you. Some Dr's are good, some aren't.  It stinks because we trust them. I didn't have the needle lymph node biopsy. I'm kind of glad because I don't want to know.  I just want to kill the cancer. I'll keep you in prayer. Jeannine",

It's okay to be down, and as I've learned (I've only been DX myself since 7/2) you have your good days and bad ones.  I haven't started TX yet.  I will begin on Friday. It gets easier to digest day after day but BC will remain in your mind. Talk to your Dr's. I've seen 4.  I didn't want to waste any more time w/a 2nd opinion. I have IDC grade 3 tumor that's advanced to my lymph glands so they're recommend chemo first before surgery. This method seems to work well in aggressive tumors so ask your Dr. It may be the route for you. You are so right. This web site has been so therapeutic.The women here are so supportive and KNOW exactly how we feel.  Also:  Keep on praying and give all that worry to the Lord. It's helped me. God Bless, Jeannine",

My daughter is 20 and I'm glad she did. (Tested negative) Your daughter is young but why go through so many years of wondering and worrying when you can know as soon as both of you are able to? Prevention is the key! I think knowing and preparing is good. If she's + it's not a matter of \"If\" it's \"When\". Yes it's a blow to find out but it can be a lifesaving fact. Had I known my gene results (BRACA1+) 5 days prior to my lumpectomy last year, I would have totally changed my decision. I was set to have my prophylactic DBL MSX this June when unfortunately I was hit w/recurrence and IBC. Sorry I disagree with Ivorymom. 6 months ago I may have agreed, but then again I thought I was in the clear and had more time. Good luck to you and think hard.

HOWEVER, I am BRC1 positive too (got results AFTER surgery)and now I am opting for a DMX and oopherectomy as prevention.  So getting the gene tests results is very important in making your surgery decision!  (Just to put you a little at ease, it is pretty rare to test positive for the mutation.) The good news for you is they caught it early. Bad news maybe chemo. Have you seen a 2nd opinion?  I thought I needed to start TX ASAP but you do have time to research and decide.  Like everyone has said, you will get your life back and be stronger. Good luck to you.
