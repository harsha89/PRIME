I'm thinking this time around can't be as bad as that, nor as bad as the chemo for bc.  But then, I thought the whole bc process would be simple, too.  After all, it was caught early, could have a lumpectomy and radiation, etc., etc.  Turned out not to be all that easy when they threw in the chemo, had to have a full axillary dissection and my incision left me with a \"mini me nipple.\"  Don't ask.  Cannot wear bras or shelf cammies because of my incisions and port.  Feels great going braless, to tell the truth.  Fortunately, I'm small, though gravity has done it's work!    When I had radiation in 1990, they took pictures, too.  Gosh, that was totally humiliating.  One picture taking session I said to the tech that they must have fun trying to match the behinds with the patients.  The way she instantly blushed, I could tell this was probably the case!! I appreciate all the care I'm getting; however, try as they might to make it otherwise, everything is so impersonal.  It's like being on an assembly line.  Reading this over, I can tell that I'm still down from the chemo but today I'm going to one of my favorite places to cheer me up--The Kentucky Horse Park, where I volunteer.    I look forward to being supported and to offer what I can. ",
