I had a complete hysterectomy and I will be taking arimidex.  I will also be doing zometa every six months for I think 3 years.  I also did chemo (TC) 6 rounds.  I was dx with ILC stage IIa with two lymph nodes being involved.  I will be having my expanders taken out soon. My question is should I not be taking arimidex if I am about to have sugery?  I know I have just rambled away...but it seems thats what I do best lately.  I wish you all the best...this certianly the hardest thing I have had to go through..what a journey!  I really enjoy reading everybody's posts....they do help Thanks everybody!

She didn't even have it in any lymph nodes....all these questions swarm around in my head and then I am just so sad for her and her family & friends.  Geez this is a horrible deal.  I went back and read her posts and she was just so full of life.  Thinking of all of you ladies!    This summer is going better than 2 years ago.....except for the fact that a friend suggested I ask for a effexor for hot flashes.....oh gosh I have only been on it for 2 months and it is not for me.  Now the task of getting off of it.  YIKES but I can do it.   Hang in there ladies and I wish good health for all of you!
