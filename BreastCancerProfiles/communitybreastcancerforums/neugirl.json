Im trying to be myself but ever since this diagnosis internally i have been falling to pieces. Its just some days im overwhelmed with worry and fear for my family. Its just all very scary and i feel like i need to stop the clock for a second to gather myself. Things just seem to be spinning out of my control.",

There is a whole line of relatives from Europe who we know nothing about since my mother/father immigrated with just their immediate family and lost touch. I wanted to do BRCA too, but they said unless you have a strong family history or are Jewish its not recommended.  I also worry all the time about other cancers and possible links. I am most worried about ovarian cancer now. I assume there are other genes beyond BRCA that they haven't pinpointed yet. I was thinking of doing hysterectomy. I feel if i could get breast cancer I could get ovarian too. No cancer in the close family we know of other than skin cancer and all have lived into old age! not sure if that is really recommended. Does anyone know if the AIs or tamoxifen still work if you have hysterectomy? I also heard there could be a link between bc and melanoma, thyroid and pancreatic. The pancreatic is one that also really scares me as there is like no way to constantly check and it is very hard to treat. voraciousrs, thanks for the info. that is very interesting about the survival differences. i guess for me it is so hard to understand what all these percentages really mean for the individual person. i wish things were more certain but i guess that is life. im assuming that the onco will have firm opinion tho so maybe that will help. ",

Well, I had extremely positive ER and PR greater than 90% on my tumor biopsy, but the Oncotype returned a less positive result. On the Oncotype, I was 7.5 positive for ER...positive scale goes from 6.5-12 and PR i was also lower. I guess I was just assuming since I was above 90% for both, my ER/PR would be higher on the oncotype. For HER2 I was very negative whereas in the biopsy i was IHC+1 (negative).  I guess I am wondering if anyone else had results such as these. Maybe i am reading too much into the oncotype scales? Maybe the biopsy results are the only ones that matter. But I am curious, if Oncotype is so different than the biopsy, how can we be so sure the whole test is accurate? I find it all very confusing and Im getting sick of all these test results and percentages and things... ",

I have clean nodes, no LVI or anything btw. Just 1.2 cm tumor. I am happy the score came back fairly low but i am still worried about recurrence. it just seems no matter what anyone says cancer can always be a tricky beast. this is what worries me. What if for some reason they are wrong or switched my test with someone. I guess this is silly but this is just how my paranoid mind works lol. I guess I also don't know what it really means to have a 92% chance of no recurrence. i got breast cancer and my chance of that was like what 2% or something. ughhh thats why i worry. ",

      "Content": "Jan 20, 2013 08:24PM - edited Jan 20, 2013 08:25PM by neugirl @voraciousre, I do believe it is possible to get a little ahead of oneself and think that you know it all, but unless you are doctor, which as far as I understand you are not, you should really leave the scientific theories to the scientists, the moderating to the moderators and the recommendations for counseling to the doctors. As softly as I can put it, I find it a little paternalistic, a little condescending and quite frankly a little bit much to continually insist that another adult, who I must add you know nothing about and have never met, seek counseling. I do not wish to be confrontational, but you and I are at very different moments in our treatment timeline. Your \u201ccounseling\u201d mantra has been consistent now on quite a few of my posts, some of which, I might add, have not even mentioned chemo. Its getting a little old. Trust me, at 2 years out I will be able to be just as confident in my chosen treatment plan as you are. Unlike you though, I won\u2019t be making an effort to edit what other women who are newly diagnosed post on these boards and I won\u2019t be telling other adults to get counseling. Ill let them come to their own decisions about that as its their business, not mine. Ill try to lend a helping hand and if I don\u2019t feel I can do that, ill leave them alone. Unlike you, I was diagnosed A FEW WEEKS AGO, so please allow me to express my concerns upon this board without be monitored by fellow members. Certainly if the moderators believe I am out of line in my questions, they will let me know and I will certainly comply with whatever they tell me. As far as I have seen, the concerns I have raised have been raised before and there is no spreading of misinformation. Most women know I am just a woman with breast cancer and not a doctor. If they find that something im saying is not correct they can certainly decide to ignore me. I am sure they don\u2019t need you to be editing my posts for them as we all are capable of forming our own thoughts. No one will be taking treatment advice from me, as I am not offering it. If my questions seem repetitive to you or irrational or emotional or whatever, please, by all means, you and anybody else who is bothered can block me or choose not to read or respond to my posts. There will be no hard feelings here. This site is plenty big for the both of us. But it is becoming uncomfortable that every time I post on these boards, which are open to the public, you respond back with some advice that I seek counseling or that im acting irrational or my question is bad or I should just move on and get over it already.  As for this question, since I am in the very midst of my treatment, I am simply pondering whether I should request my ki67 score from my hospital or a second opinion pathology because I am thinking it might be something useful to have. I was trying to gather information on it. Maybe that\u2019s an irrational request. Maybe im crazy. Maybe, maybe, but Oh well, then im crazy. Im trying to make the best decisions I can to be here for my family in the future. You can think whatever you want about me and my \u201ccloudy\u201d thinking. I really don\u2019t care. You can think I need counseling, that im having a hard time with things. Be my guest. But with only a few weeks to digest a breast cancer diagnosis and being in the middle of my treatment decisions, I think im doing just fine. I am sorry if I have not reached closure yet and that you find that annoying. I really am.  But as I have said repeatedly, you and I are at different points. You have had over 2 years to digest your diagnosis and to research and to plan. I\u2019ll know a lot more myself in two years, but I will tell you, Im not going to be coming on here telling other women how to act, trying to get them to stop posting because I don\u2019t like what they are saying. I would also implore you to seek counseling yourself. Typically before placing judgment on others or attempting to edit another person\u2019s behavior, we should take a look at ourselves for there is often much work we need to do on ourselves. We should see whether we are acting controlling or judgmental. If we are, we should ask ourselves why we feel the need to be that way. You may be trying to be \u201ccompassionate\u201d but IMHO, you need to be a little less paternalistic. Lucky for us, we all have choices and we all get to make the ones that are best for us. Recognize that in the first weeks of diagnosis, there is a lot going on. A lot of information to absorb. There is no right or wrong way to act. There is no such thing as a stupid question. Maybe I am worried. Maybe I am scared. Maybe I wanted chemo and feel nervous not getting it. Maybe I have asked a lot of questions. Maybe there are no right answers.  I am not the first woman and I certainly wont be the last. Sure there are plenty of women who would think I am crazy. But really its no ones business to tell another woman how to act or how to think or what to do. I ignored it on the other posts because I find it childish, but you and a few others should just please leave your judgments and your opinions to yourselves.  We are all entitled to our opinions about the way others act. I have got a few of my own, but I for one won\u2019t be forcing my way of thinking on anyone. I really did not wish to have another conversation with you about my decision whether to have or not to have chemo. I asked about Ki67 score in relation to oncotype. I never mentioned chemo. I reiterate, if no one wants to respond to my posts because they find me annoying then they really don\u2019t have to respond. My life will go on if no one responds to me. The compassionate thing to do is to let women use this forum in their own way and to not pass judgment on them each time they make a post. ",

      "Content": "Jan 20, 2013 08:54PM - edited Jan 20, 2013 09:43PM by neugirl @beesie, i do appreciate that you agree with what voraciousre is saying and that is fine. like i said, we are all entitled to our own opinions and like voraciousre you have had plenty of time to think things through. Like I said to voraciousre, I have had a FEW WEEKS, so im sorry if im not meeting your timeline to find closure. Let me just say though that your comment that i keep searching for reasons to have chemo is ridiculous and unfounded and has been said again and again without basis. You don't know anything about me.  i made a post which said that i had a low oncotype and that i wanted chemo and i also said on that post that i am following my oncologists treatment recommendations against chemo. I never realized that when i made that post i would have to defend any and every question i would ask on this site in the future to a group of pseudo moderators. If i sound annoyed, it is only because i can only deal with so much paternalism for so long. You and voracious re have continually made clear on post after post that you think that im searching for any possible reason to have chemo. Well you are wrong and its getting old. I want to learn about ki67, i guess im a criminal.  i have to be honest also, neither you or voraciousre are doctors so please stop acting like you know everything about what my risk is and isnt. If i can get my ki67 score, i say why not. it has nothing to do with accepting or not accepting anything. Please stop acting like you know me and you know why im asking things and you know what my motives are. its really silly and innaccurate. ive had to listen to how i don't know how to interpret information and how im acting irrational and how im digging under rocks to get chemo and it is getting to be a real drag. ",
