My first chemo treatment was Thursday, September 15. Felt pretty good, except for some bone pain, until two days later Saturday. It hit me hard. I felt like I had a terrible case of the flu. My temp quickly hit almost 102, so we headed to the ER. The young doctor didn't know what to do. He even asked me what I wanted to do. The doctors there didn't know what was causing my fever so they wanted to keep an eye on me. My hospital stay consisted of testing for strep, pneumonia, and flu. They did more bloodwork. On the days I was in the hospital, my fever spiked in the afternoons around 3:00 or 4:00. I wanted to get up and walk around, but the doctor said she didn't want me exposed to the other patients' illnesses, so I was stuck in that room. Come to find out, the fever was just a SE of the Neulasta, but there were no oncologists to confirm that until my 4th day in. When they told me I was going to be discharged, I had lower back pain that lasted throughout the next day. Hydrocodone helped that. The bone pain has been my worst SE. Thank goodness I started taking the Claritin a few days before treatment. I've been weak on some days and have been going to work. Friday night was my 30-year class reunion. I had my hair done and looked awesome, but once I got to the reunion, I broke out in a hot flash. My hair and face were drenched in sweat. Embarrassing. Yesterday, I noticed small clumps of hair coming out. Even more this morning. Trying to brace myself for the hair loss. I have mixed emotions about this because my hair is definitely my best feature, but I have TONS of it, which is very time consuming. I'm somewhat looking forward to the day that I don't have to spend time and money washing and fixing my hair. Like someone else said, I'm trying to find the silver lining. My wig is in a box in the closet. I've been trying to prepare my 11-year old daughter. She wants me to dye it pink before it all falls out. Hope all is well with you guys. I so appreciate all of you sharing your stories. Your positive attitudes inspire me.",

It's beginning to \"get real up in here,\" as my high school students would say. Seq -- I'm with ya. Spoke too soon. I was hoping my hair would be an exception -- that I would get to keep most of it -- but that's not the case. My scalp is mostly bald, so Friday night I cut mine off to about an inch in most places, although I missed a few spots. My best friend was with me, and we had a lot of laughs. She told me she couldn't believe how well I was handling it, but when she left I showed my daughter and shed a few tears. BagSharon -- My hair looks almost identical to yours in the pic, but I am not as brave as you. I can't bring myself to post it. I've always had a horrible complexion and hid it with my hair so I look awful. I'm jealous of you girls with your beautiful faces. I'm kinda sad but handling it better than I expected to. I showed it to my family yesterday. My mom and sister-in-law looked a little sad. My dad hugged me and told me I look \"pretty.\" This is not easy on them, but they are trying to make the best of it. VLH -- Day 3 was one of my worst days. Flu-like symptoms. Fever. I went to ER, and they admitted me. Turns out, it was only a side effect of the Neulasta. NotTheBoss -- You cracked me up with your purple wig. You're awesome, and BTW, I LOVE your profile name. Lmencken -- You look AWESOME! Love the short hair. You can really pull it off. Thanks for sharing your pics. Is anyone having cramps? This is Day 19 for me, and I've had what feels like menstrual cramps since Saturday. Also, my lower back and hips are hurting. Anyone else feeling that? I haven't had a period since early August so I don't think it's that. Not sure. Also, how about those wigs from the American Cancer Society? I was told we can get a wig for free. Is that true? I'm not really happy with the one I bought but can't afford to purchase another one at this time. My boyfriend and I attended an outdoor concert Saturday. I wore my wig with a cowboy hat, and we had a great time enjoying the music and beautiful weather. We then went for a \"mini-hike.\" I was afraid to do too much. Don't want an injury and certainly don't want to end up in the hospital again, but I am determined to keep on living and enjoy life through this journey. Have a great day, girls!",

I apologize if this has been mentioned and I missed it. My visits to the forum have been hit and miss lately. My last chemo was Thursday the 17th, and it has been the worst as far as fatigue. I was out of breath just walking across he room so I spent days three and four in the bed. The energy has been back a little better each day, but I still get drained very easily. My sense of taste has been terrible this time around -- just in time for Thanksgiving lol. I sooo wanted to taste that turkey and dressing. Pretty much the only thing I can taste is spicy food like chili and tacos. My tongue has been extremely dry this time around, and that has been really annoying. Does anyone have suggestions for that? I guess I'm getting a little bit of neuropathy. Opening even a ketchup packet is almost impossible. Woke up with \"the big D\" during the night, and it continued this morning. That was a first since chemo started so I'm wondering if it's just a result of something I ate. The shooting pains through the breast have been going on the last three nights and have kept me from sleeping well. My daughter has been sleeping with me. She said I woke her up with the moaning. Is anyone else having this? Should I call the MO? Hope you are all feeling as good as possible today. ðŸ˜€",

My best friend came along and kept me company. We had a tv but didn't watch it. They offered warm blankets, but I already had prepared my \"chemo bag.\" Thanks, Pinterest. My friend brought me a chemo bag too lol. Within 5 minutes, I was drowsy from the Benadryl but never went to sleep bc I was visiting. The nurse also gave me a steroid, followed by the Taxotere. I guess she added the Cytoxin, but honestly I can't remember. I was still groggy when I got home and dizzy when I got up. I've been drinking so much water that I've been to the bathroom every hour on the hour. I've taken Claritin the last couple of days to prevent bone pain. The bones in my legs were hurting last night. Is it normal to have bone pain on the first day? Also, a friend recommended the Tea Tree Oil for my nails. For those of you using it, when do you start it and how often do you apply it? I didn't sleep any yesterday due to all the visitors. I woke up feeling great this morning (the steroids?). When I arrived at work, my stomach became upset, and I got a LITTLE weak in the legs. At this point, I'm feeling great mentally and emotionally, except I'm worried about my finances. I'm a high school teacher without many days off. I will get docked for days missed. My ex stopped paying insurance on our daughter two years ago. He has been promising to pay, but now, he says the law says I must pay because he's self-employed now (???? long story). He also quit paying child support almost a year ago, so I added her to my insurance, which costs a fortune just pisses me off that he is not paying it. Financially, I'm in a mess. Thanks for all of your posts. They have been very helpful.",

I had an eventful weekend, so I'll share my experience. My first chemo was Thursday, Sept. 15. It was a breeze. The bone pain started on Saturday. Thank goodness I started taking the Claritin last Tuesday. I think that helped. Saturday afternoon it hit suddenly. I became very weak. Then my temp was 101.8 under the arm. I was told to add a degree, so to the ER we went. They tested for strep, flu, and something else, but all turned out negative. The doctor on duty said he didn't know what was causing the fever and asked me what I wanted to do -- stay or go home? I told him I wanted to do what was BEST, so he called in another family doctor who said it would be best to stay 48 hours. The white count was not where they wanted it to be, which was probably due to the Neulasta. The next morning my fever went down but rose again in the afternoon, so they kept me. I was excited about going home today, but they said they're still waiting on the white count to go down from 1500 to around 1100. Then once again my fever rose to almost 101. My bones were hurting last night, so they gave me morphine, which was not fun at all for the first five to ten minutes. That feeling scared me. I'm tired of lying in this bed. My legs are aching from being so stiff. I'd like to get out and walk around, but the doctor didn't recommend it bc of all the illnesses throughout the hospital. Now a heel spur that I've had in the past is aching up, but I haven't been on my feet. The nurses hooked up a device that massages my calves through the night to prevent blood clots. Has anyone of you been hospitalized with these issues? I'd like to hear your experience. I feel for all of you and wish you the best.",

      "Content": "Sep 30, 2016 04:30PM - edited Sep 30, 2016 04:41PM by GonnaBePoz Boy, was I wrong about the hair loss day. Day 15/16: I had a date last night with my boyfriend. When he first asked me, I still had plenty of hair. Then last night while I was getting ready, I couldn't even fix it because it shed every time I touched it, so I ended up wearing my wig out for the first time. My boyfriend told me I looked great. He has been so understanding. After I took off the wig, my scalp was dry and itchy, and more hair came out. So I went to the bathroom and cut it off to my ears. I couldn't believe how good it looked and was excited about wearing it that way today. This is a hairstyle I would not have chosen because I love(d) my long hair, but now I think I will do this when it starts growing back. So I washed it this morning, and it turned into a tangled mess, so I wore the wig to work. My high school students gave me funny looks. The comments I got were \"You look different,\" \"Did you get a new hairdo?\" and \"Can I ask you something personal?\" I decided a month ago to open up and tell my students what was going on because I wasn't sure what to expect, and I didn't want to have to explain later while I was going through chemo. They have been very sweet and understanding, too. The first pic below is Day 14 when I just thought I had lost a lot of hair. Then about 3:00 am Day 15/16, I cut it off (bottom pic). BagSharon - You look awesome. How sweet of your friends. Lynn - Are you taking Claritin? That really helped me with the bone pain. I plan to start taking it earlier before the next treatment. NotTheBoss - Prayer definitely helps. I would be in a mess if it weren't for my faith. Back to my earlier subject, are any of you single and dating through this journey? Or am I the only crazy person in this forum? Immediately after my diagnosis, I decided I was going to keep on living and enjoy every day that I can. Surprisingly, dating has been great so far. My boyfriend has been very supportive. I would like to hear other's stories if you are willing to share. Have a great day, girls, and keep those great attitudes!  ",

Ladies, I have a friend who's having pain in her scalp since losing her hair. Someone mentioned a remedy for this, but I can't seem to find it. Does anyone remember that remedy? Lynn, I know that scary feeling because it happened to me at my last treatment. See my post from October 6. I thought I was dying at chemo. I wanted to tell about a very nice experience. Last Friday was our \"Pink Out Pep Rally\" at work. Our cheerleaders hung a huge sign in the gym that said they loved me. Then we had a breast cancer survivor march, and the cheerleaders presented me with a dozen pink roses. I am very blessed. I was all hyped up about the Race for the Cure scheduled for Saturday morning, but my back started hurting after climbing the bleachers at the pep rally. It turned into a very uncomfortable weekend. My back was killing me -- middle and lower. It hurt to sit and hurt to walk. I called my MO. He said that is a common side effect with Neulasta patients and told me to take 600 mg Motrin. I still wonder if the pain is from pulling a muscle the day of chemo. I was carrying my chemo bag and took a step and felt a pain go from my backside down my leg. I was in pain from that during chemo, too. Sometimes I feel that the MO's don't ask enough questions. I'm also still having what feels like menstrual cramps but haven't had a period since July. Third chemo treatment is next Thursday. Yay! Halfway finished.",

I finished my chemo November 18 and have recently started having pain in my hands, wrists, hips, and legs. My fingers are pretty stiff in the morning, and I hurt when I get up after sitting or reclining for a time. I'm guessing arthritis, but this is all new to me. Does anyone know if this is a side effect from chemo? I asked my gynecologist last week, and he said \"everyone is feeling that way this time a year from the change in the weather.\" ?????? Well, I didn't feel that way last year. My right boob is sore from the radiation. Trying to keep gel on it to relieve the pain. How soon after radiation can we start wearing deodorant again??? My thoughts and prayers are with you guys. ",

My hair is super super thick so if it would just stay the way it is today (Day 15), I would be ok. Not as much came out today. I've always wanted my hair to be thinner so I can manage it, but it is going to take some getting used to. This shedding is about to drive me insane. Please continue sharing, girls.

My hair loss has bothered me but not near as much as I expected. CC2016 -- Don't you hate the tangles? I don't understand why it tangles more when it's so thin. QUESTIONS: 1. I read that we need to keep our skin hydrated. Does that begin with later treatments? I've only had one treatment so far, and dry skin has not yet been an issue. 2. Is anyone dealing with blurry vision? Mine seems blurry today. I also woke up with my right eye hurting yesterday. Then today, I had one huge swolen bag under that eye. Just wondering if that's chemo related. 3. I'm not a big drinker, but I do drink on occasion. Is drinking a margarita going to affect us as go through treatments? Hope all is well with you, girls.

During infusion, I had a bad reaction to the Taxotere. About two minutes in, I had a strange feeling in my chest and thought I was having a heart attack. It was a sudden flush from chest up through my whole head. It scared my mom and she called the nurse. Every nurse on the floor came running to help. They took the Taxotere off and started it back more slowly later. I guess that may be a common reaction? The oncologist came by and said he will start giving me Decadron (steroids) the day before and after treatment to help with side effects.

It's been months since I've had a chance to get on here, so it's awesome to see the wonderful updates. Y'all are such an inspiration! I'm loving the hair pics! Update: Hair: Since my last chemo treatment in November, my hair is coming back fast and furious...and curly, which is something I've always wanted. I could get away with not wearing a wig through the summer, but now it's at that in-between stage. I don't have a cute round head. Mine is flat in the back. It looks fine from the front, but the side view is not so flattering. So the bob wig is back. I'm hoping to ditch it in a couple of months. Chemo Brain: I feel as if my short-term memory and comprehension have gotten worse rather than better. This really concerns me. The words \"I can't remember\" and \"I forgot\" probably come out of my mouth 50 times a day. My vocabulary is terrible, and I can't remember simple words. A conversationalist I am not...anymore. This really affects my job and social life. I have to tell everyone to be patient with me...and they are...but how long will that last? Oh yeah. I have always been a great speller. Even that has changed. I would love to hear from others. Are y'all going through the same thing? Is this normal???? Neuropathy: Since I've had a history of plantar fasciitis or bone spurs, it's difficult to tell if it's neuropathy or not. My feet and hands do get cold and painful when others feel the temperature is fine. I'm ready to wear my heals, but not sure if that will ever happen again. Meds: The doctor put me on Cymbalta back in February to help with the neuropathy. The side effects were bothering me, so he switched me to something else. (The name leaves me at the moment.) Weaning myself off Cymbalta a couple of months ago was not fun. Brain zaps and mood swings. I felt like hell. I'm just now beginning to feel normal again, but the last few days I've been having episodes during the day where I feel like I need to lie down immediately. My head just doesn't feel right. Is it dizziness or a headache? Hard to describe the feeling, but I have to lie down until it passes. Not sure if this is related to the drugs or not. This worries me. Anyone else going through this? Again, y'all are such an inspiration. Keep the updates coming. Hope everyone has a great day!",

It hit me hard. I felt like I had a terrible case of the flu. Come to find out, it was just a SE of the Neulasta, but there were no oncologists to confirm that until my 4th day in. The bone pain has been my worst SE. Thank goodness I started taking the Claritin a few days before treatment. I've been weak on some days and have been going to work. Friday night was my 30-year class reunion. I had my hair done and looked awesome, but once I got to the reunion, I broke out in a hot flash. My hair and face were drenched in sweat. Embarrassing. Yesterday, I noticed small clumps of hair coming out. Even more this morning. Trying to brace myself for the hair loss. I have mixed emotions about this because my hair is definitely my best feature, but I have TONS of it, which is very time consuming. I'm somewhat looking forward to the day that I don't have to spend time and money washing and fixing my hair. Like someone else said, I'm trying to find the silver lining. My wig is in a box in the closet. I've been trying to prepare my 11-year old daughter. She wants me to dye it pink before it all falls out. Hope all is well with you guys. I so appreciate all of you sharing your stories.",

      "Content": "Sep 15, 2016 10:03PM - edited Sep 16, 2016 06:59AM by GonnaBePoz My first day of chemo. After a month of dread, I was relieved that it was so easy. The worst part was the tiny stick for the IV. My best friend came along and kept me company. We had a tv but didn't watch it. They offered warm blankets, but I already had my \"chemo bag,\" thanks to Pinterest. My friend brought me a chemo bag too lol. Within 5 minutes, I was drowsy from the Benadryl but never went to sleep bc I was visiting. The nurse also gave me a steroid, followed by the Taxotere. I guess she added the Cytoxin, but honestly I can't remember. I was still groggy when I got home and dizzy when I got up. I've been drinking so much water that I've been to the bathroom every hour on the hour. I took Claritin the last couple of days to prevent bone pain. The bones in my legs have already been hurting tonight. Is that normal to have bone pain on the first day? Also, a friend recommended the Tea Tree Oil for my nails. For those of you using it, when do you start it and how often do you apply it? It's after 8 pm, and I still haven't slept. Thanks for all of your posts. They have been very helpful. PS - As a divorced mom whose ex is not paying child support. I'm also worried about work. I'm a highschool teacher without many days off and will get docked for days missed.",
