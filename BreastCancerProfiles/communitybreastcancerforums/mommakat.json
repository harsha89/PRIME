Lean on this group for sure, and I'm happy to listen anytime. Feel free to private message me. I'm in the middle of the process. I didn't find anything, but went in for my FIRST mammo at 40, like I was supposed to. I actually went the week my mother in law passed away, which was crazy but I didn't want to change the appt. So they called me back the day my daughter was graduating to tell me they needed to screen my right breast again because it was dense. I was pretty cool then. Had the 2nd mammo and had to wait about half an hour, when they told me they wanted to do an US. They did that right away, and decided they wanted to do a core needle biopsy of the area. That appointment I couldn't get for 2 weeks. Had that done, waited 4 days and got b9 results (yay), but then the next day my gyn sent me a note that she saw PASH in my results and thought I should see a surgeon for a 2nd opinion and maybe have that removed. I was still OK, and the surgeon couldn't see me for a over a month (so 8/10). I was still cool. Then last week the radiologist called and said she didn't like the pathology results, felt they were discordant with what she saw, and I should see a surgeon and she was going to recommend having the area removed. So from my first mammo to the surgeon appt is like 2 months! And I'm reading like crazy, and have convinced myself I do have cancer and they missed it on the biopsy. Waiting is awful. My hubby is good, but only for coming to appts. I don't think anyone realizes that we really need support all the time, because it's ALWAYS on my mind. Sometimes in the back of my mind, sometimes it's all I think about. I also have anxiety attacks usually, and it's MUCH worse right now. My mom also just moved in with me too, which is NOT helping at all. And everyone in my life is just going about their normal day, completely not acknowledging that this is looming. I'm so sorry you have to wait, but like NotVeryBrave mentioned, even if it's malignant, nothing is going to change much in a few weeks. But it doesn't help your mental state at all. I would talk to your doctor. Maybe if she can explain to the center that you have severe anxiety and need to be seen sooner. You don't want this to cause long term damage at work or home. I was a basket case yesterday at work and literally was biting people's heads off. It was awful. Today, I'm much calmer (of course I took Xanax with breakfast, so that helps lol). Just know you're not alone. There's a whole bunch of us here, stuck waiting with you. Sending you hugs and positive thoughts!  ",

It was an uncomfortable procedure, but they do numb the area so technically I didn't feel it. The extended squeezing time in the mammo machine was bad though. My breasts were really tender based on my cycle though, so that probably didn't help. Sports bra, tylenol and ice packs helped. I was pretty sore for a few days. And even now, I'm achy in my breast. Not sure if it's still bruised, or what, but it's just achy. I waited 4 days for results, which they said were B9. Then the next day my GYN said she wanted me to see a BS anyway, because my biopsy showed PASH. I've learned this is non cancerous but can grow so they might want to take it out. Then just this morning, my radiologist called and said that the doc there felt my results were discordant, and I should see a BS to have the area removed. I've been looking that up and I think it basically means she thinks it's a false negative result. Anyway, my point in sharing is that I'm learning this journey of tests and results isn't always a straight line, and the waiting is hard. And the not knowing is making me crazy too. It's been a roller coaster of clear, not clear. My surgeon appt isn't until 8/10, so I have a month to ponder and stew before I learn anything knew. Good luck and this community has been super helpful for information and just having a group of women who have been through it and are going through the waiting too.",

As NotVery said even if they are 100% b9, as they very likely are, they're not supposed to be happening or causing you pain. Good for you for being an advocate for yourself and getting the 2nd doctor involved. Go for the mammo and see what they say. Hopefully being at a breast center, they'll give you some more attention. Dismissing you and your symptoms because you're too young to have cancer isn't fair. There are plenty of other breast conditions that can cause pain and symptoms, and though not life threatening, deserve to be looked into. Hang in there and keep us posted!",

I minimized moving around too much but I probably could have. As for anything else you have ahead of you, could you see if your hospital or county offers some services? My mother in law had ovarian cancer and there was a social worker that assessed her needs. Not just her medical needs but overall support. It sounds like you could really use some in home help for a few weeks spending on your treatments and surgeries. It may be jumping the gun now, since it sounds like you're not officially diagnosed but maybe start looking into now. For peace of mind anyway. I know waiting causing all kinds of anxiety for me and I don't have nearly all of the complicating life issues to think about too.  Best of luck to you and I will keep you in my prayers xo",

I've been waiting for my follow up with the surgeon forever it seems. I see her on 8/10 and I had my biopsy on 7/3. It's nuts. I've learned so much since then, and I completely understand how it isn't so black and white, and I'm actually hoping they'll want to do an excisional biopsy at this point. I don't love the idea of something \"hiding in the bushes\", and if I have to wait for a 6mo follow up, I can't imagine how crazy I'd be. I'm just trying to mentally be ready for whatever they say the next step is. We can only control so much I guess. Hope you get a follow up and more answers soon! ",

The left was pretty easy and kind of cool watching on the monitor. But the right. Holy hell! I didn\u2019t realize how deep the spot was. It was 13 cm from my nipple against the chest wall. The radiologist was having a hard time getting the spot because the tools weren\u2019t really long enough. Oh my god! Anyone else ever get that? Owee. At least it\u2019s done! Tylenol and ice pack packs are my besties right now. Fingers crossed for fast results. hAte wiaitng Log in to post a reply",
