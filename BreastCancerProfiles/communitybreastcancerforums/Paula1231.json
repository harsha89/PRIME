It is a total score based on 3 different sub-scores. The 3 sub-scores are assigned based on 3 components of how the breast cancer cells look under a microscope. (The details of these 3 components are not critical for you to understand). Each of the 3 components is assigned a sub-score of 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being best and 3 being worst. Once the 3 sub-scores are added, a Nottingham score is obtained: the minimum score possible is 3 (1+1+1) and the maximum possible is 9 (3+3+3). A histologic grade of III is assigned to any patient with a Nottingham score of 8 or 9. Grade I refers to Nottingham scores of 3, 4, and 5, while Grade II refers to Nottingham scores of 6 and 7. In the end, the Nottingham score and histologic grades are not very useful in the big picture, as they do not alter final overall treatment recommendations. High-score cancers tend to relapse more often than low-score cancers. Ultimately, however, we don't use the score in making clinical decisions.",

Here is the skinny on TRICARE: TRICARE Moves BRCA Testing to No Government Pay Procedure Code List TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) has determined that they will not allow payment for BRCA testing. The BRCA gene test is a blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify harmful changes (mutations) in either one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2. As a result of this directive, TMA added all BRCA lab test codes to the No Government Pay Procedure Code List effective January 1, 2012. Previously, TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest) paid the BRCA codes without prior authorization. With this change, TriWest must deny all claims submitted for this procedure with dates of service January 1, 2012 or later. The existing Healthcare Common procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes below were added to the No Government Pay Procedure Code List, effective January 1, 2012: The new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes below were also added: For more information, refer to the TRICARE Policy Manual, Chapter 7, Sections 2.1 & 2.2, at http://cl.exct.net/?qs=25ef06f050ffb85af7748d8784d6c4c3c528bee767eb0f1f2c9e4705db14a204.",

My surgeon said it was better now than later, and I agreed.  Better to be rid of the tumors and the possibility of reoccurance in the same breast that to do it all over again at a later date.  Hang in there. ",
