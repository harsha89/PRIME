You're an angel.  Thanks again! Mindy",

Hugs & thanks to both of you ladies, Mindy",

You have really been through a lot with 3 bouts of DCIS!  You are absolutely right:  A patient has to be aggressive especially if she has that gut feeling that I'm starting to have.  Peace of mind is everything. Hugs & thanks, Mindy",

Take care. Mindy",
