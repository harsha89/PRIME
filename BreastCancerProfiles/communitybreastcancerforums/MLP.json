I needed no further treatment.I've gone back to my normal activities. I really haven't thought about lymphodema until now. I've done several 5Ks last year and have been asked to do a mud run. Do I run the risk of LE crawling through mud or am I looking for an excuse to stay out of the muck?",

I figured my heart must be in better shape than I thought because I lived through it.  Thanks for the link, it was very informative. I had no idea of the risks.  I just dove back into my life without thinking about it. I've been very lucky.   Here's the link to the fun.  http://lozilu.com/",

The doctor showed me a picture of myself and when I saw how much I sagged it really helped me make the decision to remove both and start life anew with a perky new pair of breasts. I've also lost 10 lbs.since my BMX 3 weeks ago. Who knew! I've avoided mirrors for ages. Now I'm looking forward to a healthier fitter future! ",
