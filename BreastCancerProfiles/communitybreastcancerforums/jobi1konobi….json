Let me say the dye was nothing, no burning the worst part was puting the needle in. but really it felt exactly like a biopsy. and the worst part for both for me was the lidocane needle. but i can say for me it was nothing. what i was afraid of was the wait time between arriving at the hospital until i actually in the surgery, waiting is usually the worst. i have had bad experience before, but this was not bad, and i stay in the pre pre op area with family until it was ready for my surgery. then i waited a couple around 10 minutes in pre op until my OR was ready and each of my surgeons come out to talk to me.  then the pre sedative and seriously 9 hours later, which seriously felt like 20minutes later i was in icu. i woke up and couldnt beleive it was over already. i understand your nerves about finding out your stage after surgery. for me that didnt come into play until a couple of day later, because for me i was dealing with the actual surgery and it took time for me to deal with that before i could deal with anything else. then i  was told or maybe only when i remembered. i do have issue from the surgeries and i would say dont go bigger than you are when you are having a DIEP FLAP because i hope/believe it causes iron bra, and that is what i am experiencing and it hurts like hell. upon reading others comments i also experienced years ago having spinal surgery, a horrible long waiting room, try to get an early as possible surgery time, and stay away from city hospitals. good luck.",
