I have been through a lot of chemo, surgery and radiation and I'm here to tell you you will make it through. I have been without treatment for three weeks now. My energy is coming back slowly. I still have some side effects from this whole shindig but they are quite manageable. When I was going they chemo I just longed to feel like my normal self. I thought I never would. My days were a jumble of feeling grateful and feeling sorry for myself. Brighter days are coming your way. It just may take awhile.You can do this. Your feelings are normal. These June chemo ladies (I'm originally from Oct '16 chemo board)are a great group. You'll be glad you have them to talk to. I hope things get better soon! ðŸ’š",

I am from \u201cStarting chemo in October 2016\" board and contributed on your board months ago regarding Nail Envy which had helped me keep my fingernails (though none of my toenails). I had chemo, then surgery, then radiology and am now finishing up the last few of my 17 Herceptin infusions- only have two left). My entire treatment from beginning to end will have taken 16-17 months in total. I still have my port but will be happy to be done with that at the end of January. I'm on Exemestane as an estrogen blocker, began that about 6 weeks ago after side effects from Femara. I have s/e\u2019s with exemestane too, but will have to get used to them. For those of you beginning radiation soon, it will be done before you know it. It will be behind you. My wish for you is that your techs are as kind and good as mine were. Kindness goes a long way in getting through something like this. And a sense of humor. I was lucky to have medical staff who had both. I guess what I want to say is that you, too, will be able to put this behind you and move on. Not with your old life. But a variation on it. You'll learn to accept that you are different physically and emotionally. And you'll be proud of yourself for your journey - no matter how much you felt sorry for yourself or complained or had negative thoughts, you did it. You did it. My very best wishes to each of you Nancie",

I have just finished radiation, which was the last step for me (aside from Herceptin once every three weeks through February, '18). It's been 11 months from the time of my first questionable mammogram until now. I was HER 2+. Thus s what has happened: Chemo (THP) from Mid October till beginning of January. Had lots of side effects, the worst being skin issues Chemo (A/C) from end of Jan to end of feb (harder than THP) Surgery- lumpectomy and axillary mid April- only 2% if the tumor was left - it was removed and margins found to be clear Radiation- 33 sessions, June through last Friday (end of July) I also had 4 biopsies done, and 6 mammos in the past year What I've learned in a nutshell: 1) everyone's' experiences and s/e's are different 2) yes, treatment will take about a year, unfortunately 3)you can get through this. Some days will be awful, but some days won't. I made lists of a couple of small things I wanted to accomplish. Some days I did them, some I didn't. But it gave me goals to look to. 4) lean on people. If not now, when? They want to help. Let them. 5) question all medical people as much as you need to 6) be appreciative of every medical caregiver who show you TLC. And there will be many 7) write stuff down. In the beginning, I made a chart of side effects. It was an excellent way to compare those first 12 weeks of chemo. I brought it in to my oncologist, who rolled her eyes a bit. But it was super helpful to me to tell if things had gotten better or worse 8) I used OPI \"Nail Envy\" on my fingernails. They stayed lovely, if I do say so myself. I didn't use it on my toenails. 9 out of 10 of my toe nails fell off. I'm still growing them back. A coincidence? I think not! 9) I ended up liking caps more than my wig. I ditched the wig after about six months, and even before that didn't wear it often. I had lots and lots of nice hats and caps to wear. That was my splurge. My hair is now less than 2\" long (last chemo was end of Feb) and looks cuter than I could ever have anticipated. I took Biotin (Trader Joe's ) every day and still do. 10) one of the worst things was losing my eyelashes and eyebrows. My lashes started growing back in April. They aren't as thick as before, but ok. Brows started growing back in May, very sparsely and slowly. I use powder on them everyday. It has been comical some days, creating brows with no guidelines to follow. Try to practice a lot before all of yours go. My right one always was easy to do. The left one, ha! I still have neuropathy in my feet, but mostly noticeable in bed at night and not horrible. I have numbness in under arm area where axilary node removed. Not horrible. I have tiredness from radiation. I can deal with it. I am lucky to have had an extremely wonderful support team - family, friends, medical - and am proof that you, too, will come up on the other side. Any questions you may have, ask me. I would love to try tohelp anyone who needs it. Love to all ",

I put it on my fingernails and kept all my nails in good condition through my treatments. I only used it a couple of times on my toenails, and lost 9 of them. I don't know how common that is but it really happened to me. I am still in the process of watching them grow back - they look awful. I figure by November I may be able to finally get s pedicure. I am five months out from my last chemo. I still have neuropathy. However it isn't dibilitating at this point. It is infrequent and mild in my fingers. It is more noticeable in my toes, especially when I'm laying flat in bed at night. I wear Snoozie slippers to bed and that helps to keep them warm. I just kick them off in the middle of the night if I need to. I've found that the s/e's do dissipate as time goes on- it just takes a good amount of time- longer than we want. But it will come.
