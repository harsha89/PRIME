There are many drugs prescribed \"off label.\"  I was prescribed Zantac off-label (when it was prescription) for chronic canker sores. There is a whole book on this subject about this, The Off-Label Guide to Prescription Drugs. It wouldn't have this antibiotic in it yet,tho. My doctor had the book sitting on his desk so I got a used copy for my own use from Amazon. Good luck. Worth a try.",

I was advised to get it writing before going to the hospital and not waiting until you arrive or you won't know what you're signing. Someone on this board told her doctor the week before that she wanted only two nodes and then signed the consent form in the hospital without specifying the number of nodes. On the way in to surgery she reminded the surgeon and the surgeon said it's too late you signed for me to use my own judgement. She now has bad lymphedema. All we can do is warn other women.",
