But at least I've had 3 pretty darn easy weeks.  Cindy, my center did not initially offer breath hold.  I met with an RO at my surgical hospital who would have used breath hold for me, but she knew I was going to look into the closer hospital for rads, so she said to ask about breath hold there.  They got it going just for me and even fashioned a doorbell for me to ring if I had to breathe out mid-beam.  I say this for anybody that is told their center doesn't offer it.  There were some initial bumps in the road, like an extra planning session when I had to lie in position for an hour while they did x-rays with my breath held over and over, because they weren't sure how much variation in my chest inflation was acceptable.  That really bothered my treatment arm, ouch.  But I considered it an investment, for me and perhaps for people later on.  They wouldn't have to put someone else through that, I don't think.  It was the techs' learning curve.",

CLYDAY, take heart!  Some people do have trouble with rads, but hey, you've been through chemo, and quite likely you will find rads easier.  (This is what I hear from just about everyone who's done both.)  I tried to hydrate more and eat more protein and didn't do very well, but I might get enough protein already.  I did a breath-holding technique to protect my heart--ask about that if they haven't brought it up (they called it deep inspiration breath hold).  Others will probably be able to answer about the TE issues (ask your RO if you haven't), but I had only minimal skin and fatigue issues.  I got emu oil online, but what I actually used was 99% aloe jelly (from a health food store, $4), Aquaphor (which the RO gave me), calendula cream (online) and 1% hydrocortisone.  I mostly used aloe during the weeks of rads and the others after the boost, when my skin was pinkest. My real advice is to stay distracted.  Rads didn't take as much out of me mentally as I thought it would because I had a different driver every day.  The variety was a HUGE help--I wasn't thinking much about the countdown, just about who I was talking to on each long drive.  Since you'll be away from home, maybe make a scheme to do something different every day, get yourself a little treat, read a great book series, whatever makes you happy and makes the time go fast.  Long break from work?  Maybe not so bad.  Good luck and keep us posted!",

I'm quite interested that your surgeon said not to bother with Tamoxifen.  Have you met with an MO yet?  I'm meeting my new one on Thursday and I assume she'll say Tamoxifen + Lupron (ovarian suppression), but perhaps not?  Our diagnoses and age are similar except for my micrometastasis.  I'm more nervous about hormonal therapy than I was about rads.",

I have a tiny bladder so lots of water drinking is a tough road for me.  Also, I have to do all my hydrating in the afternoon hours so my morning drive to rads and my sleep at night don't get disrupted by repeated bathroom visits.  But it sounds like a good idea to drink a lot.  When I asked my RO nurse about it (not even telling her my concerns), she said extra water wasn't that important. Have the rest of you heard from your RO or RO nurse that hydration IS important, or could this be one of those things that patients take more seriously than medical staff?

Thanks everybody for the confirmation about the importance of hydration.  I'll do my best.  It will be worth it if I can reduce the rawness you talked about, Lemon68!  Ouchies! Deep inspiration breath hold is where you hold your breath during each beam.  The point is to inflate the chest and get the heart farther away from the beam.  I'm doing axillary radiation because of my sentinel node micrometastasis, so I gather that is more helpful for me than most.  Plus there's a fair amount of heart disease in my family and I was extra concerned about heart impact. Because my center hadn't done it before, they weren't sure how long it would take to get enough rads in.  On my set-up day, they tested to see if I could hold my breath for a full 60 seconds.  To my surprise I could!  The last 5 seconds were pretty tough.  However, I haven't gotten much over 30 seconds since then.  I haven't really had to--the beams are really 20-25 seconds each--except a couple of times when they tried to take an image during the beam which added about 10 seconds.  I \"failed\" both times, but that was apparently no big deal, as they just didn't get the image that way.  If I can't hold my breath for the whole regular beam, it only means they have to repeat some of it to complete the rads delivery from that angle.

Destina, thank you for being open.  I want to know what can happen and where it goes from there.  I hope your last raw spots clear up fast. Sallyann, I echo what others have said.  It's very sad to hear about your meltdown, but it's an honest and important reaction and I am grateful to you for sharing it here.  I've had a few.  One was when I read about all the possible sexual side effects, especially of chemo.  I cried for an evening and the next day, because that is a lot to take away from me and even more unfair to my husband.  Also, a few weeks after I was diagnosed, I found a book my dad gave me--he died suddenly in 2002--which he'd inscribed, \"To my magnificent daughter.\"  Suddenly I thought, \"If he were here now, he'd realize I'm not magnificent anymore--I'm damaged.\"  Cried for hours.  Believe me, I know it wasn't rational or true, but just part of processing this sense of my body having been compromised by something hostile.  I was thinking about this episode again today and I found I don't feel damaged anymore.  I think I just had to pass through that fiery gate as I considered what it all means.  Also Sallyann, I am a bit envious of your face-down rads.  I'm doing breathhold to protect my heart but nobody offered me a facedown position.  Maybe I'll ask my RO about it.  She's a little young, hadn't heard of breathhold before me, but I like her. I am 15/30, half done with rads today!  Made it to rads/PT and back before the ice storm hit here in NH.  So far so good.  My skin's a little pink, but if anything my breast and nipple are less sore than they were a few days ago.  I lube the boob twice a day with aloe jelly, and now have other products on hand in case it gets worse.  I haven't had much fatigue yet, although I crashed for 2 1/2 hours last Sunday afternoon in a way I considered suspicious.  I am a chronic bad sleeper so I too love Zolpidem.  Walking every morning, 20-30 minutes, also seems to help stabilize my sleeping.  Unfortunately I have been staying up too late catching up with work (grading, class prep for teaching) because I'm having trouble juggling my work, various appointments, kids/husband, and vital media therapy like here on BCO plus email & Facebook & phone.  Today I started PT to help avoid lymphedema, extra important because I'm getting axillary radiation.  My treatment arm proved to be a bit compromised so I'm glad I'm doing this, though it complicates things for my drivers.  My other news this week is that I don't need chemo!  I wrote about this drama on a thread in the Chemo forum called something like \"Oncotype score 13, MO still pushing chemo,\" which I'm about to update.  I have so much admiration for all the chemo warriors.  I'm sure I could ultimately have handled it, but I was very scared and really hoping to avoid it, and my second opinion team agreed that it isn't indicated for me.  May the weekend of sleeping and healing begin!",

That might be getting better too.  I'm tired, but only maybe 10% more than usual, and it's essentially more of the same rather than any special kind of fatigue. MMSS, rotten luck!  I am shocked that they left the stickers on you.  I found them very uncomfortable and the techs were quick to take them off as soon as they could.  They used acetate to trace a map of my boost area and put the acetate back on the breast every boost day, dotting the boost area with a Sharpie.  This was not really pleasant (I made dramatic faces so the techs would know!) but not exactly painful.  If I were in your shoes and the stickers were bugging me and I were feeling rebellious, I think I'd pull those stickers off and let them deal with it on Monday.  It's asking a lot for you to keep them on over the weekend!  Won't they come off in the shower?  (Wink, wink!)",

It's more like a toddler getting cranky and after a minute you think, Oh, late for our nap, are we?  It always takes me a few beats to realize what's going on.  I take a nap and stay sleepy for the rest of the day, but it is never that kind of slamming fatigue that some get.  I have this maybe one day a week, still, a month post-rads, but it's a small thing for me.  Your mom's experience will be her own and no one else's.  Based on what I've heard, though, I would be surprised if she stayed solidly, equally fatigued for three months after radiation.  JayjayC, congrats on the happy skin!  My skin did well too, phew.  As you may have read, my itching has roared back to life in the last week or so; I'm going to ask my new MO for some 2.5% hydrocort.  I did not find the boosts scary, but then I got good explanations.  Funny how people can't predict what we'll want to know, because some things seem obvious.  Jeepers--plop a big machine right on my hurt boob and of course I'm going to want to know how this won't zap my heart!",
