After a really rough time the first weekend (ended up in the ER on an IV after the nausea took hold for almost 48 hrs), we brainstormed a ton of solutions. Never doing that again... Anyway I have been eating non-stop since during the infusion. No major meals, just bits and pieces of good yummy stuff every hour or so: green drink, an Activia yogurt, some soup, a few bites of raw coleslaw, and a good dinner last night of salmon/ wild rice and greens/ salad. I second the recommendation above for the Cancer-Fighting Kitchen- great great book. I can't quite go fully plant-based, and she is very centrist and accomodating. https://www.rebeccakatz.com/the-cancer-fighting-ki... My friend the radiologist with bowel cancer also strongly recommends cannabis, and that works for me, with both body and attitude. Also having some Zofran ODT will help if I can't keep them down. Last week i went from icky to BAD right at the Neulasta. Guess I better go take a Claritin right now- it's going to start at 6 pm or so. Hard to believe those things cost roughly $6000. I guess they are trying to retrieve some development and research costs, but wow. I hope Blue Cross picks up ALL that bill, but our cancer center pre-authorizes everything. But if that's what made my white blood cells recover- I am all for it. Anyway I still have all my hair, am going to the gym every other day even though my rate is amazingly high (for me), and I wipe everything off before and after using. Only 2 more AC (dose dense), then on to a 4-session regimen of Taxol, Perjeta, and Herceptin. But that is on a 3-week cycle, so I can actually have a life. I love reading your stories and advice, everyone. We got this!",

Looking forward to NOT getting beat down after feeling strong 3 weeks afterwards. I'm prepping for the radiation, which is another half hour away than the chemo, making it 1.5 hrs one way. Once I know the schedule I'll post it up on my meal train site, which has been awesome. Coming home last night completely drained to a nice chicken/ asparagus/ pasta salad dinner was amazing, thanks to the Meal Train. Helluva road we are on, ladies. Patience and persistence to all.",

I have been itching since late June, when the pre-med steroids wore off. I did one course of Prednisone, which gave me some short-term relief, and now I am using the Triamcinolone, but it puts cracks in my fingers. Hot showers fire it up, as does drinking wine (the histamines!). Topical benadryl helps, as does benadryl tabs to make me sleep. I'll be ready to see HP and the maddening itch go away in March.

But then a PET scan on Jan 12 showed no metastasis, which greatly helped me to sleep at night and warded off the 3am heebie jeebies. You all know what I am talking about... I have an amazing and supportive husband, a great team at the Teton Cancer Institute, an army of friends, and a new puppy. Whew. Ready to start chemo on Jan 29, as every step is one step closer to being done with this. I am a mountain guide by trade, really fit, 57 years old, and luckily our house is paid off so I can choose to only do my editing job. Not sure of my chemo mix yet, but am certain that it will include Herceptin and some other biologicals. Every two weeks for 18 weeks, then 5x week for radiation for 5 weeks. Go girls!",

I had hoped so hard not to get the red devil, so I pretty much lost it in the Teton Cancer Institute office. Everyone was so nice, and I felt embarrassed. But my husband consoled me by saying, \"they aren't the ones who have cancer, you are... so you are entitled to lose it.\" Made me feel a lot better actually. He's a rock- how lucky I am. Going tomorrow to get my hair cut short, not gonna shave it yet, and not gonna bother with a cold cap. I wear hats and scarves a lot as it is, and the Oncologist wryly told me that they don't work well with the red devil anyway. I'm going skiing tomorrow while I can. Go girls- we got this.",

First round of research comes up with this article: http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2014.32.15... and this one: https://oregon.providence.org/~/media/Files/Providence%20OR%20PDF/fish_oil_in_the_cancer_care_setting.pdf but then of course there is the other side: http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/breast-can... that says you shouldn't take it. My friend who is an ER doc agrees with you about pausing the supplements for the 3-4 days around treatment. My cancer center ices hands and feet during taxol. One less thing for me to worry about bringing/ providing. They seem to be pretty up on their practices for being in rural Idaho. Remarkable. And the hair effects are so varied, person to person. My head hair partially fell out dramatically 3 weeks after first AC, 1 week after second AC. But now it is all starting to grow back: head hair, funny little wispy facial hairs, leg hairs, itchy pubes (TMI again?). Eyebrows and lashes fully intact. Wait and see how the Taxol works, I suppose. I am not cold-capping- it only works 50% for the AC, and I don't have the $ or the patience for it. It's only hair and will grow back. We have winter for another 2 months- I'll just put on a hat. And I have a great excuse for buying another cute little cap: https://www.turtlefur.com/products/comfort-shell-ponytail-conquest-beanie I also did a round of research on coffee/ caffeine, which gave similarly broad responses from quit it altogether to it might help (especially with triple negatives) to no effect. The overall effect of the research on my practice is nil, however, for there are certain benefits (overcoming terminal grumpiness is primary) that are achieved by morning coffee. I did start using a much smaller cup, and omitting those afternoon coffee pick-me-ups. An older oncology nurse came over to bring me some soup the other day and she had the best and most practical medical food advice I'd heard yet. And I have gotten the full range, as I imagine have many of you. She said, \"eat what your body craves. it will tell you what you should have.\" Happy Sunday, all.",

I would have slept through it but there was a hubbub in the chair next to me that woke me up, oh well. Yesterday I felt fine and sortof manic (thanks Dex), and today am achy and always cold, thanks to the Neulasta. My WBC counts were low so we decided to go with the Neulasta to bump them up. I did a bunch of research from articles in the taxol thread and found that L-glutamine, L-creatinine, vitamin E, and a B12 version called methyl cobalamin are very helpful to stave off SEs of the taxol, especially the neuropathy. I asked my MO about them, and he was very positive, even said, \"isn't that all in the literature that we give you?\" but it wasn't, needs to be updated. So- being your own advocate in this work is hugely important, I am seeing the results for sure. Stay strong, but sometimes strong means knowing when you aren't.",

I am a mountain guide and athlete, so exercise is my meditation and my go-to. My MO says that's why I've done well. So I want to encourage you all- even if you feel like crap, get outside or to the gym, get your heart rate up a bit. It makes such a huge difference physically and emotionally. My 4-month-old puppy pushes that process for me! Here's a photo of us from yesterday in Teton Canyon, nordic skiing.  After first round of taxol/ perjeta/ herceptin (TPH) I felt the neulasta worse than ever. Felt like day 1 of the flu (maybe it was?) But I went in tired and low wbc counts from my Arizona trip (but I have no regrets). Then a friend brought over soup, but it was this wild rice/ cream-based soup, and it upset my beleaguered tummy pretty bad, set me back a few days. I put the offending soup down the disposal and am back on track, belly and all. 3 more TPH to go, then radiation. I did get news yesterday from my new primary doc (that's a whole nother story for another time) that the year of perjeta and herceptin starts AFTER the TPH, not including the 4 PH in the TPH. This process sure does go on for a long freakin time. Anyone else having issues with patience? I am ready to be done, ready for my hair to grow out (it itches like crazy now), ready to get back to work. Breathe, breathe...

A couple of observations: I got a lot of external \"congratulations\" about finishing chemo on the day of the final infusion (May 30), but internally felt like the last few days (a week post-final-chemo) were when it really hit home, as the side effects were wearing off. No more smack down by taxol just as I was getting strong again. Huge relief. And Paisley- I had a single mastectomy (I can't remember the abbreviations) the day after Christmas 2017. Honestly it was the least painful and least invasive part of the whole experience. I spent the night in the hospital but could have gone home. Axillary node dissection and port placement (Jan 2 2018) was MUCH more painful and unpleasant. I don't miss that sick boob at all- glad it is gone, along with its alien invader. I am really enjoying this respite of 3 weeks between final chemo and radiation simulation (June 19). It is gorgeous here and the last few months have given me a great appreciation of being alive, outside, with friends or hubby or dog. I'll post this pic in one of the exercise threads, but here's a photo from my bike ride yesterday. Teton Canyon is my happy place in the summer too.",

Red rock and green vegetation as it is grey and rainy and depressing here in the Tetons. I've had a pretty reasonable time with AC side effects (1 bad day which is 2 days post- treatment), but for some reason I am (unreasonably) afraid of the side effects from my next round, TPH, taxol, perjeta, and herceptin.

When my PET scan came back clean in January it was a HUGE deal. Makes ALL the difference. Krose- hope yours is just as clean. Okkate I feel for your sister and for your whole family. So much to go through in a short time. Roxy you look FABULOUS. I am done w chemo (as of May 30) and feeling stronger all the time. I go in next Tuesday for radiation simulation, then start my summer job (haha) of 30 trips to and from Idaho Falls- 1.5 hr drive woo-hoo. But if it helps make the odds of recurrence lower, then I am all for it. Although I must admit that, between the 30!!! trips and a recent bout with chemo acne, plus STILL not having hair (including eyebrows and lashes), I did have a bout of depression this week. Ooof. Riding my bike helped, but this is still a LONG journey and hard to remain upbeat all the time. My DH is working full time and having knee pain; I think he has a torn meniscus. So he hasn't been quite as supportive. Are you all getting your ports out? I can't stand mine- getting it out on July 2- although it feels like an unlucky thing to do with recurrence in mind, I am betting on clean living and strength to keep the cancer away. And one more question: were you given guidance from your ROs about supplements and anti-oxidants during radiation? I'm gathering info to see the range of advice.",

I got a bucket-load of advice about everything from deoderent (ok) to shaving (not ok) to lotions (they will provide all, from aloe (first choice) to Aquaphor (second choice) to silvadene (only if necessary). 30 sessions feels like a LOT, but I put the schedule on the Meal Train and all but maybe 4 days are taken already. I have such an amazing community of friends. Also got a herceptin/ perjeta infusion, but NO pre-meds- hooray! So no steroids or drugs that require steroids (chemo). Huge improvement, although getting this infusion at a different cancer center (next door to RO office) was very disorganized and wasted my time (biggest pet peeve EVER).

After today's Herceptin and Perjeta I think I have 4 more of those, which is also bittersweet, because they bring such amazing protection.

Couldn't keep anything down, including water, so ended up on an IV (saline and Zofran) in the ER. Came home and was STARVING. I don't ever want that to happen again. The next time I ate small bites continually through chemo and every hour afterwards, which helped a lot. Bread and peanutbutter crackers and spanakopita (that my Meal Train brought), Activia yogurt, and so on. Second round I also did some cannabis (vape or smoke- not the edibles as the smell made me gape) as my radiologist friend with stomach cancer reaffirmed that cannabis is a very good anti-nauseal and sent me some gorgeous homegrown buds (he lives in Colorado). So interesting what your dietician said.... I concur on the sugar for sure. The raw food I am mixed- I don't do much during the 4 days just after AC (my most sensitive times), but I make a green drink with the juicer usually on Monday after a Thursday infusion, and it seems to be the main thing that gets my bowels back on track. Carrots, celery, kale, an apple, and a scoop of protein powder. My body craves it. At our cancer center the nurse said to eat what we crave, protein is best but anything is better than eating nothing. But drinking lots of water is the single best indicator of who is going to do well with chemotherapy. I've been fixated on getting exercise and getting outside. Happier mind in happier body... Some days it is SO hard, but I make myself. The Neulasta makes me feel like crap (Claritin helps), but my white blood counts have rebounded well. I am not anal about staying out of public places, but when I go to the gym I pre-wipe all the machines and the floor mat. My 3rd round of AC is this coming Thursday, so I am on a similar schedule to you, DXAt37. I hope you have a GREAT week and can be accepting and calm for Wednesday. (I am talking to myself as well, not trying to be condescending as SO many people have been giving me quite the array of useful to useless advice). Amelia I am so glad your bestie is coming. That will make a world of difference. Don't worry about being upbeat or planning stuff to do- she is coming to help you and it is your turn to accept her help. I am the most stubborn and do-it-myself person I know, and it has been a journey through humility to learn to accept help and meals and gifts, and to say thank you. It's our turn to take.",

I'm so ready to be done, moving on to the next phase. Good for you for your RO appointment already set up. But spring is finally here in the Tetons, it's our first warm weekend, and I got this. Glad you all are here- you've been a great help so far.",

Okkate I am so sorry about your sister's diagnosis. But you will be there with her and for her, as will the rest of this community.",
