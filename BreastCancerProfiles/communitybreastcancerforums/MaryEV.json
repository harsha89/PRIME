I only spent one night in the hospital too but I was so lucky to have a private room and my wonderful 23 yr old daughter stayed overnight with me. The nurses were angels! But it is so much better to be home. I am still sore but doing well. I am only taking the pain meds at night now and tylenol during the day. I have 3 drains and they are the only areas that hurt. I have a checkup with my surgeon today so he can remove the steri strips and check out everything.  Heal well!!! Mary ",

I am meeting with a plastic surgeon on January 21st and hope to get the surgery scheduled after that so it may very well be early February. When were you diagnosed?

I saw my breast surgeon yesterday and he did an aspiration on my left (cancer/axillary) side and removed 70 cc's of fluid. It really helped and I feel so much better. From what I can tell, this is pretty common and your surgeon should be able to do an aspiration to reduce the fluid buildup, although I am not sure how that works if you have TE. Mary ",

I called them the night I found out it was cancer, December 30th. I was very glad that they had each other close by, as they got together that evening for support. They have been wonderful and so supportive throughout my bilateral mastectomy and recovery. As the others said, only you know your daughter, but I have always been so close to my kids I knew they could handle it and would want to know as soon as possible. Mary",
