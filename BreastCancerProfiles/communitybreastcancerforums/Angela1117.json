The nurse explained step by step to me before we even went into the mri room and everyone was very good about explaining things as they went on. I also liked that it was the same doctor who did my ultrasounds 20 and 23 years ago when I was pregnant.  The ativan helped take the edge off as I was very nervous this morning. I finished my 3 mile walk in record time burning off some stress! My husband came with me and as we were leaving the doctors office he said \"how about lunch at Hooters\" which made me laugh but you should've seen the evil death look one old lady gave him. He said he didn't care....he was just trying to get me to laugh and it worked. Will let you know my results when I get them. Thanks for all the care and concern. It really does help. ",

Hoping there were no more parking tickets and birds being flipped! I'll be glad when this is over tomorrow. Of course, then comes the wait for results. I guess I'm in the high risk category since my mom and her mom both had breast cancer and 2 years ago a first cousin on my mom's side was diagnosed. My sister has had 2 of these core needle biopsies that were both benign so hoping this runs in the family. I had an mri last week and was told there's an irregular area that's not highly suspicious.  I had my yearly mammogram in January (no changes) and the radiologist recommended the mri and my gyn agreed but suggested waiting until July so we would be getting a look every 6 months instead of once a year and I thought that was a great idea. Thanks for thinking of me. I'll check back here tomorrow. Angela ",

That seems like record time to get results but I'm not arguing. Lynnie, will send you good thoughts all weekend that you'll get the same news next week. Mommysta, yes, DH was pretty good about all this... Angela ",
