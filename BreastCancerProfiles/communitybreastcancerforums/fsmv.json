Some time ago a kind of a pimple appeared in my right breast and latter, what seemed like a swollen pimple came up on my left breast. I also had like a small soft lump on my right armpit. I was really scared and went immediately to the hospital. The doctor examined me and said it was probably nothing. He gave me antibiotics. I went to my family doctor a few days after that and again after checking me out, he said it was probably nothing, more like an infection or something like that and said I should stick with the antibiotics the other doctor had given me. I took the antibiotic for about two weeks. The swelling and redness started to disappear and from then on, the lump on my armpit tends to change sizes, sometimes is more swollen, sometimes less but never disappeared entirely. After about 4 months, this weekend, a new red \"pimple\" appeared on my right breast. None of these appeared on the nipple or the surrounding more brown area. It is always outside these spots. I have no discharges from the nipple or anything like that but sometimes I feel a bit of a discomfort on my right arm. I know I should go to the doctor again but i am really scared of doing it. It's like if I do, a process of exams and more frighten will follow and if i don't, everything will be ok. I know it's a stupidity but I am really scared and I clearly don't know how to deal with this. To add to my fears,  I am 35 and cancer runs in the family. I am now living a very happy time in my life and I feel that if I acknowledge something is wrong, that time will end. I have said nothing of this to anyone. Have some of you felt like this? Knowing you should check things out and not doing it for these same reasons, even when you knew you were wrong? How have you handled it? Any help please? Log in to post a reply",
