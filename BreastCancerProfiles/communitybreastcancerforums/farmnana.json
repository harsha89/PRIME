Congrats on the baby...November 8th is the perfect day...my birthday!!! Deb",

Dolphinsac...if you have any concerns about your doctor or hospital, please find someone you feel comfortable with.  I had a wonderful doctor and hospital and I feel very lucky.  I felt that they actually cared about me and my needs.  You keep searching until you find that comfort, but don't wait too long.  The sooner you get this monster under control the better you will feel about the whole process.  I wish you the very best.
