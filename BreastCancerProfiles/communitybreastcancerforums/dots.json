      "Content": "dots wrote: I had some concerns about my right breast in early March. Some dimpling below the nipple when I raise my arms. I talked to my gyno about it last week. She did manual exam and was concerned enough to set up a digital mammo and ultra sound, scheduled day after tomorrow.  She said she felt something suspicious and wanted more testing. I had a mammo in January and was informed I have dense breasts and to watch for changes.  Last year I remember having extremely itchy nipples, mostly on my right breast, but that cleared up. I feel very stupid for searching on line for \"dimpled breasts\", because now I am having sleepless nights! Any information on my symptoms would be appreciated!  Thank you!  Log in to post a reply",
