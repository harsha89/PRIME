Ended up with a huge dogear under my arm which feels like a big rubber ball. I had undergone a reduction 15 years ago and was going to make the appointment with the same plastic surgeon to take care of the dogear. Then I read many of the posts made on this website and thought there are SO MANY of us!! I asked my surgeon at my last checkup - and I'm sure many other women did also - why did you leave this lump of flesh? Well, it's adipose tissue. I know that means FAT tissue but so what - it was part of the breast, now the breast is not there to hold it forward any longer and I have to live with this? Then it dawned on me - it's not \"healthcare\" any longer...it's the \"health INDUSTRY.\" So we women go thru this horror of mastectomy, pain, drains, painful mammographies, needle biopsies and they leave us with THIS? I am SO angry and I'm cancelling my appointment with the plastic surgeon - because it's draining Medicare - this is what this is all about. Prescribing drugs - whether needed or not. Referral to other physicians - whether needed or not. Just to keep the big money wheel turning. I'm not going to take the Anastrozole - which will lessen recurrent breast cancer by a MERE 7%? That's not enough to pay that much for this drug every month. I'm getting off the money wheel that keeps going round and round. I cannot believe that the healthcare industry would do this to women who have already suffered enough and gone through this continuous fear - only to leave us uncomfortable, scarred and disfigured - even though out of necessity. The LEAST the surgeons can do while you're under sometimes dangerous anesthesic and the coming weeks and weeks of pain that they cannot REPAIR this while you're undergoing mastectomy. It's all about the MONEY!!! ",
