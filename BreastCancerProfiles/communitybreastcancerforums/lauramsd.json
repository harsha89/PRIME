It seems like the timelines from diagnosis to treatment tend to be months rather than days or weeks. I'm very grateful for all of the reassuring words. A dear friend of mine called me today and I told her about the lump and about my uncertainty about the timing of my imaging. She encouraged me to at least move it up to before Thanksgiving. She felt worried for me. She also pointed out that if the news were bad, having my family all around me at Thanksgiving might be the best thing for me. And that if the news were good (far more likely), I'll enjoy the holiday more with my mind eased. So, I called the office and they still had the original appointment open. So, off I go to Disney in 3 days and then I'll come back and get my imaging done the day before Thanksgiving. I am assuming that I will be reassured that it is nothing but a cyst and that I will be giving Thanks for my good health. Thank you all for your wisdom and support. It has helped me to feel less alone.",

I was told that we will go straight to a breast ultrasound and if they want me to have a biopsy, they'll just do it right then without me needing to make another appointment. I will get my imaging results in real-time as they are doing the ultrasound. I like that! The downside is that they only are in this office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so appt availability is limited. I live in a rural area so we have a lot of specialists that travel from region to region during the week. Honestly, if it wouldn't affect my prognosis, I'd rather wait until after Thanksgiving to go through all of this. I'm about to go on a week's vacation *with my mom* (who had bc 2x) to the Happiest Place on Earth. It's a once-in-a-lifetime trip for my kids and, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't want to ruin the trip for myself and everyone else by finding out I have cancer right before we leave- unless, of course, that would make a difference in my prognosis. Then I come back from Disney, have 3 days at home and go spend 4 days with my family for Thanksgiving- including my mom. Don't really want to ruin that either. I don't want to be stupid and delay the imaging if it would make a difference. But how likely is it, really, that a week would make a critical difference? And if it wouldn't make a difference in the outcome, I'd frankly rather be in limbo for the next two weeks than risk finding out the worst and then have to try and hide it for the sake of my kids, you know? I'm sure this is probably an unanswerable question- would it make a difference- but that's what's gnawing at me. I've really been keeping it together for most of the last 3 weeks. But right now I'm just freaked out by how much bigger and firmer this thing has gotten in such a short time. And then I Googled- and that's when the panic set in....",

      "Content": "lauramsd wrote: I am brand-new to this site and to these issues. Three weeks ago, I felt a lump in my right breast while taking a shower. It felt small and soft and sometimes I wasn't even sure if it was there. But my mom had breast cancer twice so I take this very seriously. (She was tested for the breast cancer genes and came up negative.) I'm 35. The next day, I called to apply for a free program in my area for detection and treatment of breast cancer. (I don't have health insurance.) I was sent to an NP for a physical exam. She said she thought it was probably a cyst but that I should have it checked out. I was referred to a local cancer center that provides imaging through this free program. Because I have some travel coming right up, and because of Thanksgiving coming right after, I wasn't able to schedule the imaging until Dec 4th- more than 4 weeks after my physical exam. Now, I know, rationally, that this is most likely a cyst. But over the last week it has gotten bigger, and harder, and is now somewhat tender to the touch. It went from this subtle mass that I really had to feel around for to a hard lump that is very obvious- about the size of a walnut. Sometimes my breast aches a little in that area. I tried to Google \"how fast can breast cancer grow.\" Bad idea. Now I'm terrified. I'm reading things from official cancer sites that tell me that once you can feel a lump, it is big enough to have metastasized. I'm reading that tumors grow faster in younger women. I'm reading that a painful lump is a bad sign... or a good sign, depending on who you ask. I'm sitting alone at my computer crying knowing that it is most likely nothing but..... what if it's not? What if delaying the imaging by just 4 weeks costs me my life? Is that crazy? I have no sense of what the normal time lines on these things are. I desperately need a reality check on what is a reasonable time line for imaging and what is irresponsible delay. I could move the imaging up by a week by changing my Thanksgiving travel plans. But I don't want to do that if it's not likely to make any difference. Please help before I Google myself straight into a panic. Thank you in advance. It is such a relief to break the silence of my fear and reach out anonymously to people who have been there. Log in to post a reply",

I'm just so grateful that I found out about it. I pushed them to allow me to go straight to the ultrasound. From what I've read, it seems like breast ultrasound is more accurate for diagnosis anyway and then you avoid radiation from the mammogram. I'm glad that the doc agreed to that approach. Are you going to make the appointment for imaging?",

I leave in 3 days and the earliest appointment they had was the day before Thanksgiving. I could have taken that but opted to delay it by 1 week until I returned from our Thanksgiving trip. There is a 4 week gap between when I was first seen for a physical exam and when I can get in for the imaging. (And it took me 2 weeks from when I found the lump until I could get in for the first physical exam.) But my personal delay is only a week. Your post fed into all my fears about this being a fast-growing tumor- even though I know that isn't very likely. I looked up IBC on cancer.gov and it doesn't sound at all like my situation. I don't have any redness, swelling, or inflammation and no swollen lymph nodes on exam. I have a lump the size of a walnut that is somewhat tender to the touch. 2-3 weeks ago, it felt very \"fluidy\" but now it feels much firmer.",
