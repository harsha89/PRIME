I found out that there ARE cases of breast cancer even while taking Tamoxifen, unfortunately it doesn't lower the risk completely. It was helpful to me to visit the Tamoxifen and DCIS boards, and also check out some of the ways other women have coped with ADH. There's a lot of wisdom here and it can really help in making a decision. Blessings.....Jaye",

Some of us had similar concerns, and I agree that it really helps to get a first-hand account of how the procedure went for other women. Some of us have been diagnosed with atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia (ADH and ALH) and reading those messages might be helpful too.

Before now, they came back either clear, or questionable, so I've had more than a few biopsies over the years. There was a new cyst this month and my breast surgeon scheduled me for a needle biopsy. I got the results last week, which was atypical breast cells. She was concerned and recommended that I have the area removed. She also wants me to follow up with an oncologist after the surgery, which is scheduled for next month. In the meantime, she's scheduled another breast MRI (I had one last July) I'm concerned, not just because of the atypia, but because she's listing the procedure as a partial mastectomy, not a breast biopsy with removal of the cyst and the area around the cyst. I'm going under general anesthesia, too. I'm a little worried that it may be worse than she's telling me. What are my plans?  Pray, pray, pray. Try to think positively. And ask for a copy of the actual biopsy report, which I was too stunned to do during my appointment. I thought about delaying the surgery and trying to improve my health, but I think I'm going to just do it. My mother was a breast cancer survivor, and although I know the disease has changed, I still have her courage and my own strength. I would appreciate any kind of positive feedback from other women. Right now I feel very alone. Thanks.  Jaye, ADH dx 4/2012 w/L/Lumpectomy Log in to post a reply",

This forum is a great source of info and wisdom--in fact brendaks sounds amazingly like my breast surgeon  The info she gave was spot-on. My breast surgeon said the excisional biopsy is important because it gives us a chance to see if there is any cancer in the area, and therefore start treatment early. She also said that some women elect not to do it. They just want to accept the results as benign. The risk there is that if there are any cancerous cells, they might continue to grow without treatment. Her opinion is that it's better to know, than to not know. When I first came to this site, I honestly didn't know whether I would do the excisional or not. I had a lot of drama going on in my life, and it was not exactly a great time to add more to the mix. After getting feedback from other women who had faced the same choice, asking more questions of my breast surgeon, and a consult with an oncologist, (and prayer) I decided to do it and it was a wise choice. They found no cancer (yay!) yet now through the whole process I know much more about atypia, my breasts, good health, and my options. I feel more confident in making the best decisions for myself now, which is far different than I felt just 2 months ago. I would co-sign all the advice you were just given, from the mods, ma111, and brendaks. Make a list of questions and concerns and ask about your options. My breast surgeon made me feel comfortable in asking any questions, and I think you will feel better once you meet with him/her. Keep posting, let us know how you're doing. You are NOT alone.  Blessings!    Jaye ",

I was right there last month after my own needle biopsy, and what I'm saying from my heart is to let yourself cry, and feel all your feelings. It was such a relief to talk, to post messages here, and to just CRY. Suebak is right, there is wonderful community support here. What we fear most may not even happen, so it's important to remember that, and take it one day at a time. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Please keep us posted.",

With clear mammos and ultrasounds I think most people would feel like everything was ok. Glad you got the mri and are moving forward with treatment, you sound very focused and determined, and that makes a big difference. My mom did a complete turnaround after her bc diagnosis many years ago, she changed her diet, dropped a toxic husband (my dad), changed her job (it was awful) and started walking every day. After awhile, she was singing in the mornings!  She never had a reoccurence (sp) and she's my inspiration. It's never too late to start, and of course, there's unfortunately no guarantee, but it's worth a shot.  Thanks for sharing your wisdom with me--so glad you got treated early!  I would love to hear what exercise you decide to do once it's ok to get started.    Jaye",

I agree with you not wanting more surgery but I wonder if massage or heating pad or ibuprofen might help with the pain? As of yet I haven't tried much, but your description of fat necrosis sounds exactly like the warm-feeling large lump near my surgery site.  If I reach down and gently massage it, it DOES feel better, but I have to keep doing it. I just hope I don't slip up and do it in public, I'd probably be arrested.  I'm going to google fat necrosis and see if any other remedies might be out there. Maybe a holistic remedy. If anything interesting comes up, I'll post it. Hoping you feel better soon. Hugs, Jaye. ",

I have been actually massaging the side of my breast every day and sending love to it (thanks Louise Hay) and the heat has reduced and discomfort has too. I took some ibuprofen a few days ago and if it didn't help, well, it didn't hurt. Hard to tell.  My BS put new steri-strips on the incision at my followup visit, and once they drop off I think I'll use pure coconut oil on it.  An irony is that my expensive Bali bra is irritating to that breast, but the inexpensive Fruit of the Loom Walmart bra feels like heaven. I went out and bought another one just because it's so soothing to my skin. Go figure.       Jaye ",

It also feels a lot warmer than the other breast and I feel like I need to wear a bra, even when I'm lying down. There's a large lump of breast tissue on the left side, and I remember my surgeon saying she made a point to fill in the area where she removed the tissue for the biopsy. I usually end up massaging that side of my breast and it feels better when I do it.I'm chalking this up to the healing process but would like to know what symptoms you had, weeks after your excisional, and about how long they lasted?   Thanks, Jaye  Jaye, ADH dx 4/2012 w/L/Lumpectomy Log in to post a reply",

I follow up with the breast surgeon in November. In the meantime, I've improved what I eat and exercise every day. I may not look like it, but I'm 60 lbs overweight and it's beyond unhealthy. Had to cut out a lot of sugar, which was good. I'm working on lowering my stress level, which was high.  I'm going to post about Tamoxofen, since the oncologist wanted me to start on it and I've decided to wait. My instincts tell me not to do it yet. Overall, things are well, and I'm very, very grateful.  So there's the update on me! Now about you! What's the timeline for Fri?  Hugs, Jaye ",
