    "Content": "Lillysmom88 wrote: I have never had any breast issues, but on Christmas, I had emergency gall bladder surgery, and immediately after, I had strange pain in my left breast, like it was filled with broken glass when I moved.  It went away as time and days passed, but even now, it feels bruised.  After several medical people did not really give me any answers about this, I finally found one person who said that I was probably mis-handled or moved incorrectly, and/or strapped down much too tightly.   I was wondering if this could cause me problems, or even cancer cells to grow , in the future.   It has been harder for me, at age 68, to mend after the surgery, and worrying about this other issue has not helped.  Would appreciate any advice, information, etc.  Log in to post a reply",
