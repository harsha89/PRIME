      "Content": "Sep 27, 2009 06:21AM - edited Sep 27, 2009 06:26AM by Kathy16 I finished Taxotere/Cytoxin in September.  The message boards and preparation lists were extremely helpful.  I wish I had known: 1.  How important choosing your oncologist is - I had outstanding care and after difficulty with 1st cycle was put on a Sancuso patch (already had emend and zofran) and pepcid and Ativan to sleep - my drugs were tweaked so I didn't suffer - if you're at the beginning, choose your oncologist carefully.  I was terrified and yet, I really didn't suffer - my oncologists and nurses managed my side effects so well!  I couldn't do too much the chemo week, but I never threw up.  I was lucky b/c although I thought I had chosen a great oncologist (and I did) I didn't realize how crucial it is that they are responsive to your SEs (and lucky for me they were). 2.  I wish I'd known a little bit about the side effects of the steroids.  I was actually wide awake for most of 5 days after 1st chemo before they added Ativan.  I'd sleep about 2 hours a day off and on.  It was crazy.  Get something for the sleep before you start - believe me steroids wind you up like nothing else.  Also wish I'd know if you have reconstruction that the chemo week will make you feel like you have an elephant on your chest - not sure if it was Taxotere or the neulasta - but it will be uncomfortable and then settle down the week after chemo.  3.  I wish I'd known to be patient with myself.  I tried to take a \"long weekend\" after chemo and work.  Duh!  Then I went to my employers and asked for a FMLA week off after each chemo and then worked a week and a half before the next one.  They were very helpful and they didn't have to pay me b/c it was FMLA and my paid leave had already run out after surgery. I had the time I needed.  When I got back to work I was very tired, but a better employee and I was better able to concentrate on getting my body strong.  This might not be an option for everyone, but if you can take time for yourself, it's worth planning it. 4.  Finally, a month after chemo ended, I'm still BEAT!  One night I took an hour and a half nap after dinner and then went to bed for the night!  My primary doctor said it can take up to 6 months for the effects on your body to go away and your body to build back up its strength (and I'm relatively young - in my 40s).  It's frustrating b/c you're done your treatment and you want to move on with your life.  I'm trying to be patient - but even reading some of the other message boards, it seems you might not be able to feel like you did before the diagnosis for a while - so although you can start getting back to life, it might not be at pre-BC levels for a little while due to decreased energy levels. Good luck to anyone reading who is starting - the \"going through chemo\" message boards are invaluable and it always amazed me that people were so generous in posting so much good information.   ",

For me the stretching and strengthening exercises have really helped.  If anyone hasn't been to PT, I would try to advocate strongly with your doctor to go see an LE therapist so you can start the stretching and exercising - it really helps.  Thanks for listening - I'm glad to have people who understand and a place to vent. ",

I am 48 and had a grandmother who had a radical mastectomy at 48.  My father had prostate cancer and it appears that this is a genetic thing - not skipping generations.  One doc said she did not think I had the BRCA, but did have a gene that science/doctors haven't yet identified. Is anyone else having side effects from Tamox?  Every ache and pain is difficult for me - I'm having stomach issues and bone pain, although the bone pain is resolving.  Love to hear what everyone else is finding on the Tamox or how everyone else who has completed the treatments is handling the fear.  I really believe my symptoms are SE of the Tamox (and I can live with them), but feel stressed and upset because of them. Thanks. ",

I loved the make-up but I actually enjoyed the comraderie and socializing with others even more. Tougherthan - The Emend saved me from the nausea and once it ended after day 3, I had a harder time and had to have IV. Next time they're going to give me Emend and a nausea patch, so if the emend isn't enough, apparently there's a patch too. Shae - I'm sure everyone's prayers with be with you too. Not sure how or what advice to give - or whether it would even be right to try, but many of us have made it through at least one and you will too. They do give you a lot of drugs before the chemo cocktail, so you might feel a little less nervous depending upon what pre-drugs they put in your IV. The benadryl in mine almost made me fall asleep. And the chemo nurses (at least mine) treat you like a queen - making sure you put your feet up, offering you pillow, blankets, drinks, snacks, anything you need. I think most of the chemo nurses seem to take really good care of the patients from what I hear, so I hope that is a comfort to you.",

I just saw Fran Drescher on TV (which I'm watching way too much of lately) who had uterine cancer and now has a website about gynecological cancers - www.cancerschmancer.org.  She has an interesting story if anyone is surfing and has time on their hands.  The site also has prevention and research articles about different cancers. Also - just in case this helps anyone - from the beginning, my onc prescribed the Emend and Zofran.  I think if people are having a lot of nausea and vomiting, it's worth asking for the Emend and if that doesn't work there is a patch called Sancuso.  My other big issue last time was the steroids and sleep - I slept an average of 1-2 hours per night despite Ambien and even Valium.  This time they gave me Ativan pills and for me that really seemed to counteract the effects of the steroids where you're awake staring and jittery for 22 hours a day. Hope everyone has a good weekend & feels as good as possible.  Take care.",

I'm about14 weeks past my last chemo, so they recommended possibly wearing the wig another month and at 20-24 weeks growth or so, coming in and they could pull my hair through the cap, highlight it blond and just shape it up to make it look like a trendy style.  I would have loved one of those clip ins, but I just can't justify spending $1,000 when I've been on FMLA and it would be so temporary.  Here's hoping and praying for a healthy 2010 for all of us. ",

After all of my research, lists, packed chemo bag which I didn't use a lot of it but glad it was there, I have a great big DUH on my part to confess.  I had my left hand in an IV and a 4 hour treatment where I did drink a lot of fluids, so of course I needed 2 bathroom trips pulling my IV pole along and once I got to bathroom had ONE HAND to take care of everything, and I wore JEANS.  How stupid to overlook that.  If you go for your first chemo and have it in your arm, make sure you wear pull on shorts, capris, sweats, elastics - just nothing with a zipper. I was exhaused with all the benadryl and anti-nauseas, but they also gave me such a load of steroids the scale is already saying 5 more pounds and I ate almost nothing today.  But now the steroids have me all pumped up and I'm not tired at all.  Nurse said this would happen.  So far a little indigestion and I had a sinus headache which they said could happen with my TC regimen.    Josybee, hope you're doing okay - you're a day ahead of me and thanks all for the timeline on hair - I'll be on lookout b/c nurse and hairdresser said not until second treatment, but I'll keep my eyes open.

Eventually they take it out after a few days and of course, they still give you oral pain meds.  4) The drains are a pain, but look scarier than they are.  If you google mastectomy, there is a u-tube video that a nice lady did talking about the drains and showing them as a public service.  I thought this was a lovely thing she did and that's also where I got the website for the camisoles.  5) My biggest problem has been constipation and exhaustion, so give yourself some time and stock up on laxative - there's another thread I just read about the constipation which I guess is pretty normal after the surgery.  6) for Shower with the drains, I used my husband's work lanyard (he had an extra), but a shoelace or ribbon will work.  My drains had sort of a flap that could be threaded/laced into a string or lanyard and that's what I do.  I hope some of this helps and all the best to you - God bless. ",

I'd like to vote for name #9 or any other with \"jedi\" in, but I'm easy, so whatever you decide. White 929 - are you ok?  I didn't see posts from you and I had a very mixed week - you're on my same cycle and chemo. Lori - If your employer has more than 15 employees, they are bound by the Family Medical Leave Act and you have up to 12 weeks and you can take it intermittently if medically necessary.   Here is a website for the Cancer Legal Rights Center - you can call them and they will research it for you but take a long time to get back (few weeks)  http://disabilityrightslegalcenter.org/about/cancerlegalresource.cfm Joni2 - you raised concerns about nausea and are on the TC like me - I had emend and Zofran and when emend ended I had trouble getting my liquids in. I never vomited, but felt yucky and a little nauseous so fluids dropped.  They brought me in for IV fluids and more anti-nausea and changed my protocol to add a patch next time, so don't worry, just call your docs if nausea isn't being controlled.  Yes, the emend is really important to take.  It was when that ended I had trouble. Quarter 405 I also had diffculty drinking huge volumes.  I tried to keep track of how much I drank and tried to get 64 ounces of something in me.  the sodas did work for me - grape gator ade worked better than orange. But I found I could not simply drink huge.  Salty nibbles helped my sore tummy and then made me want to drink more b/c of the salt.  Not sure if this will help you.  I don't usually gobble a lot of junk, but I did nibble on some junky foods during the hardest chemo days like chips and crackers.  You might not want to eat a lot of it anyway. Beachbabe - don't stress out about the weight b/c you'll go into chemo at one weight, maybe not eat too much that day and wake up like 6 pounds more in 12 hours!  It's the chemo and steroids, but it's water retention and then you'll lose the water retention during the next several days.  They say if you keep going up rapidly you should call b/c they worry about too much fluid retention. Whoever said they can't sleep - I haven't had a full night's sleep in over a week thanks to steroids, even with valium and ambien - it's normal but hard side effect.  Last night I finally slept 5 hours, woke for 20 minutes and then another 3 hours.  Today I feel wonderful.  I don't have any tips about that one - mainly just that when steroids go away you sleep closer to normal. Paulding Mom - thanks for the huge laugh about naming your wigs!  Prayers and hugs to everyone. ",

White 929 and I are on same schedule to the day (hope you are feeling better by now) and for me also days 4 and 5 were terrible, but it took until about day 8 when I felt stronger and worked without difficulty. This time I'm taking a week off after the chemo. White 929 - I hate to tell you this, but my hair is shedding. Is yours? Can anyone give advice on how many days from when you \"shed\" - notice hairs in shower, on your shoulders, etc.? Last night I went to \"Look Good\" (which is every bit as great as everyone says and I received a make-up kit they valued at $200-300 with Estee Lauder, Lancome, etc.). The ladies at LGFB said they didn't think my hair would last a whole week. Today I called my wig stylist and she is on vacation until Tuesday. I'm mainly worried about next Mond-Wed. when I have to work. After that I have chemo and am off a week. My hair is very thick (was it Dianne who also said she had thick hair and it was just thinning?). So I still have a full head of it, but today was nervous so put a scarf in the middle of my head (not over whole hair) sort of like a fashion wrap thing and got compliments from co-workers who don't even know I am going through chemo. Any advice on how many days would help, although I know most people shave it before it starts to become noticeable. Hugs and prayers to all getting ready to go for 1st chemo & the rest of us pushing ahead! :)",

I did not cry (that would have been embarassing) but had my list of questions and wanted to share some of the answers in case it helps anyone: My immune system - will be back to normal in about 3 weeks like before treatment he said; Regular flu shot - up to me (this might be different if you're in ongoing treatment - your dr.'s advice might be different) Wine - only 3 ounces, but can cook with wine no problem Caffeine - does not cause breast cancer or make it worse according to him, although like anything they probably want it in moderation. Swine Flu - he advise to get it, said he is going to get it b/c it's a risk to all Americans.  Said his advice had nothing to do with my cancer and now that I'm done treatment my risk is the same.  I'm nervous b/c vaccine is so new - are they rushing it???? My next appt. is Nov. and I'm going to ask him about Vitamin D and nutrition then.  As everyone speculated on the causes, it's so clear that it's too complicated to even guess.  I've been buying organic beef for years to avoid the hormones and cook for my family relatively healthy.  I need to lose 20 pounds and am thankful that I didn't gain during the treatments, but like someone else said, half of America is much more overweight and the breast cancer % isn't 50% of women.  It is certainly more complicated than hormones or diet soda or drugs we took, foods we eat.  I also had a lot of stress in my life with handling the \"sandwich generation\" of caring for young children who needed a lot of care and parents before their death and now failing in-laws.  Who knows?  Jayne - my prayers for a speedy recovery - I understand shingles are very painful and you really don't need that while already suffering through the chemo Gilly - likewise for the ankle - I hope it is a speedy recovery, although I know sometimes bones take a little while and patience to heal.  Everyone is so strong - it has given me strength.  And for anyone who needs or decides on radiation I know Pauldingmom's board will rock.  I won't see you there b/c although I've been struggling (my tippy toe is on the line of what is even considered the \"gray line\" - they're still studying it) and it would only help a local recurrence only and jeopardize both my dominant arm with lymphedema and my reconstruction.  Two opinions estimated between 3-5 total percent and maybe up to 10%.  My onc put my percentages with the surgery, chemo, and taking tamoxifen at 90% for no recurrence, so I don't want to risk the side effects of my arm and reconstruction for just 5%.  Some people would be more comfortable to have the 5% and I respect that.  It makes it hard that it's a personal decision and the docs can't make it for you or even tell you if you're one of the women it would help.  It's not like chemo or surgery - more clear cut.  Anyway, I've rambled enough and wish everyone the best.  I hope you don't mind if I lurk once in a while to see you all doing well and moving on - finishing up treatment.  And good luck to everyone who does need the radiation. People who search and find this board entering chemo will find such a wealth of helpful information.  You didn't just help me and everyone else in July and August, you will have helped people being diagnosed right now and facing chemo soon and in the future. God bless.  Kathy",

As far as causes, would anyone mind sharing whether they took fertility drugs (which i did with great abandon in my 20s and 30s) or the pill?  When you can't have a baby easily you don't really think beyond tomorrow b/c all you really want is to have a family.  Now I have to wonder (especially given mine is estrogen positive).  Also never having a pregnancy or having a first pregnancy late in life is also cited as a risk factor (not always something within our control). gillyone - I hope those bones heal quickly and feel badly that you have to go through this also.  Lori1 - sorry if you answered this before and I can't recall, but would you doc consider Emend (it's also expensive, but maybe your insurance would cover).  A lot of us use it  and have referenced it on the list - it seems to really prevent the nausea and vomiting. Between that and a Sancuso patch they prescribed I have never vomited, although I don't really eat normally the week of chemo.  Take care everyone and have a nice weekend.",

Thank you to everyone who let me know how quickly you were losing hair when I posed my hair question.  It is day #7 and I do still have a full head of hair, albeit a lot thinner, but it comes out every time I wash, comb, mess with my hair in any way.  I don't have a problem with shaving it - but I wanted it to last until I had my chemo week off from work coming this Thursday so I could come back to work with the wig.  For those who aren't ready to shave and want an alternative -- this week I've used some pretty rectangular scarves like headbands, not covering my whole head but with bangs in front and my hair showing in back where it's thicker and got several compliments.  People thought it was just a new \"look.\"  It gave me a little security and self-confidence that every day people wouldnt notice it was thinner and I have one more day to work this week, so I think I've made it.  All the best to new members who are just starting out - thoughts and prayers are with you.   ",
