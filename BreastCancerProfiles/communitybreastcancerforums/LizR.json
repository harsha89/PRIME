Thank goodness for your post!  I followed your link and found a lymphedema specialist (LANA trained/certified)) and called my doc back for a script.  Spoke with the PT this morning and am scheduled to see her next Friday.  It has been about a week and my arm is getting better - but this is definitely a wake up call - time to be more proactive about caring for my arm.  Trying not to think too much about this - need to wait and see what happens at my evaluation next week.  Thanks to all of you ladies who are spreading the word about lymphedema and helping us catch this as early as possible.  Liz",
