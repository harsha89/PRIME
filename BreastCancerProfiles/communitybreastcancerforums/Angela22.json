It is SO frustrating when the doctors say \"don't worry\" and the insurance has to \"approve\" everything.  I keep saying \"red tape, more red tape.\"  I know what you mean by saying \"crazy -making.\"  There are definitely some problems that are causing delays in diagnosing and treatment.  When this is said & done, I am going to try to make some changes.  I work for Quintiles, one of the world's largest Contract Research Organizations.  We manage pharmaceutical clinical trials.  My company may be willing to partner with the American Cancer Society to design and help implement a new standard protocol for any doctor to use when treating a potential breast cancer patient.  Maybe we could call it something like \"Ready, Set, Think Pink.\"  The campaigns for self breast exams & yearly mammograms are pretty effective...but it seems like when we find a lump, some doctors/insurance companies are dropping the ball.  Perhaps a one page laminated simple guideline from the ACS with signs/symptoms & their recommendations on imaging studies/bx.  I know not all docs need this, but I've read where some women didn't get dx for 2 YEARS after finding the lump...somebody needs some help.  I think it would be necessary to educate insurance companies and the doctors' office staff who submit ins approvals on the importance of expedited procedure approvals.  Also important to work with hospitals to manage block time, so that there is adequate dedicated time for the breast surgeons to perform biopsies in the OR.  My appointment with the oncologist was Aug 2nd, but she didn't have block time in the OR available until today, Aug 31st.  Oh, I've got my wheels turning!  :)   I too have a gut feeling this is cancer.  If its not, I will be happily surprised.  Our govenor of NC, Beverly Perdue once said (talking about hurricaines) \"Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.\"  But I've never felt anything this \"wrong\" in my body before.  At first, the lump was totally non-tender.  Months later it became painful, then the ribs.  Doctors say, \"don't worry, painful is a good sign.\"  But from what I've read on this website, many women had pain before they were diagnosed.  I think the ACS should revise the \"symptoms list\" so that doctors will not have that thought process and dismiss many women based on that criteria.  And with you, the lump was mobile...doctors say mobile is also a \"good thing\"...making my point about misconceptions from providers which cause delays in dx & treatment.  I had the excisional biopsy/lumpectomy done this am.  She took out the whole mass.  It had grown to about 4\" x 1.5\" (yes, I mean inches, not cm).  Thankfully it was at the lowest part of my breast (kind of centered at 6 o'clock).  I have large breasts (D cup) and my left breast was slightly larger than the right before...so now, the right side is slightly larger.  She did a good job. The worst part is waiting for the path report.  She said it could be Tuesday, due to the holiday.  :(  But, I am going to try to relax and enjoy my family.  I hope all you ladies have a great weekend.  May God bless you & keep you. Big hugs to you too, Angela   ",

Although I am a nurse, I have no experience in breast oncology and this is my first time dealing with this personally. So it is very helpful to get advice from someone who has \"been there, done that\". The doc who did the FNA is a Board Certified General Surgeon, specialized in breast surgery. The second opinion oncology BS shares your thoughts about the FNA vs core biopsy. She thinks this lump should have been biopsied correctly in May, but said \"all we can do is move forward from here.\" Please say a little prayer for me on Friday. Thanks again!",
