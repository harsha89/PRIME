I was in the hospital twice with infections, due to my blood counts. I felt just horible when I was on AC. I would get my treatments every 2 weeks, so I would only have maybe 4 days that I would feel human.Â  I made it through with the support of my husband and once I was on Taxol, it was a breeze. Try to hang in there if you can. May God Bless Sue",
