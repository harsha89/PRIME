I am on prevacid and take it faithfully everyday. I also experienced alot of heartburn, indigestion with my second AC which was last week. I also experienced constipation which I don't think helped the situation. This week I am doing better but trying to stay away from certain foods especially fried....Next week I go again for #3 so who knows.....I am just praying each one will get easier.

Constipation once again is also a factor. Thanks Laura for the tip on the pitted prunes. I am willing to try anything. I will definitely give them a try. I don't want to be a complainer but depression isn't helping me either today. Do you girls ever get a day that all you do is cry? For me it seems to be right after I go off of the decadron and anti-nausea drugs. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.",

How have your blood tests been since you started Taxol? I just found out yesterday I am anemic one of the side effects from Taxol....My ONC said he is going to give me a shot but decided to wait until next week when I have my next taxol treatment so to keep me on the every two week schedule. Of course now my mind is working overtime thinking it is going to get worse by next week. I guess that explains why I have been tired but I don't think it could be that bad or he wouldn't be waiting to give me the shot, would he? I guess I have to stop this worrying. Anybody else haveing trouble with low red blood count? Graycie",

You probably aren't getting radiation beause your ONC doesn't feel that you need it. I guess it all depends on what kind of cancer you have. They must be pretty confident that the chemo is going to get rid of all your cancer which sounds like a good sign to me. Graycie",

I think she said it would be around $28,000 which was a little over their budget. I can't believe how much they charge when these babie's are in such need of loving families.",

I agree we should all stay together on this thread through radiation, after all we have come this far together, and Laura you stay with us too.....Mary has a point you may not be getting radiation if you had a mastectomy. When I had my lumpectomy the nurse told me she chose a mastectomy because she didn't want chemo or radiation. My Breast surgeon told me that if my SN came back negative I wouldn't have to have chemo, just radiation, unfortunately that wasn't the case. Here's one I can't figure out, My son-in-law's grandmother has BC 10yrs ago and she had a mastectomy and never had to have chemo or radiation. I thought that was odd. She had 21 lymph-nodes removed also, not sure if they were positive or negative....She is now 86 yrs. old and has not had a recurrence. I guess it all depends on what kind of cancer you have as to how they treat you...I hope everyone is feeling well today and has a nice weekend. Graycie",

If you do need it, as far as getting sick with all the new drugs they have now that shouldn't happen. I never got sick. I would also recommend the port. It is so much easier plus it saves on your veins. Goog Luck, I am sure your ONC with go over everything with you. Graycie",

She did a weird tape job under the glove when I went yesterday. I also have to do some exercises but it doesn't seem to be going down much. Who else has LE of just the hand?  Is it just Tracy and I?  I'll have to ask her when she get's back from her trip how long it took for her's to go down.

Michele, Did you do the BC walk too?  I didn't see the pictures either. I have to say, you have some strange things going on with your posts.  I see the tree Laura is talking about but I never clicked on any of those icon's. Deb, That is too bad you are having so much trouble with you sciatica. That can be so painful.  That's a good thing they are scheduling both your appt's together for your mammo and US that way you get them both over with at the same time.  They always do mine together and then I go right over to the breast surgeon and he reviews them. Time for my appt. with the PT.  My hand is getting better although the fluid has moved up into my arm.  She said that is OK since it has to go somewhere and it should go down once my other lymph nodes take over and push the fluid through my heart and then it will go out my kidneys....Weird if you ask me.....",

The seat was too high and once I got over the bar I couldn't touch the ground and over I went. Everyone had a good laugh but me, although I did end up laughing I was twisted up like a pretzel and I am starting to feel it now. It's funny because I was going to buy a helmet today but didn't think I needed one. I guess I better rethink that one. I feel like I am turning into a Debbie, sorry Deb.........lol",

You never know until it happen's to you how you will react to a situation.  I do believe you get an inner strength to help get you through because I would have never thought in a million years I would have been able to handle everything we have had to go through and still are going through for the rest of our lives. A day doesn't go by that I don't worry. Our lives are changed, they will never be the same but we are all stronger because of it.  I guess I can look at it this way if things didn't happen the way they did I never would have met all you wonderful ladies so that I am thankful for. ",

I have to say my hand is getting better so maybe it is from the massage.  Nothing in the arm so far.",

Binney, I can relate to the diabetes.  My daughter and son both have juvenile diabetes.  My husband has type 2 diabetes and then I end up with the cancer. ",

I decided I better call it quits and went in the house since I thought maybe the hot sun had something to do with it. Now, a couple hours later the swelling seems to have gone down, I am just a little swollen on the wrist but the fingers look better. Does this sound like LE? My fingers always get a little swollen when I am out in the heat but since the one hand was alittle worse it makes me wonder. Did this ever happen to anyone else? Now I am afraid to do too much.",
