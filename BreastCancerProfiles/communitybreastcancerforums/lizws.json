She is very weak and has had to resume morphine due to the pain that the tumors are causing. We are all praying that this chemo will reduce the size of the tumors in the liver. If she is up to it, her husband Scott is going to try to fly her back to Florida this evening.    CTG - Prayers that you are now home resting. Hugs Liz",
