Thanks At the 4:00 position of the left breast, approximately 3 cm from the nipple, an irregular hypoechoic solid-appearing lesion is again seen measuring 8 x 5 x 9 mm. Mild internal vascularity is noted as well as posterior acoustic shadowing. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended. ASSESSMENT: BIRADS 4 - Suspicious - Biopsy should be considered.
