    "Content": "suthrnatheart wrote: I am a 29 yr old mother of 2 and for the last 2 weeks I have had pain in my right breast and under my right arm I can feel something hard (that isn't on the left side). To me the right side of my right breast feels harder than the left one but I don't know that I can really feel a lump. Also the right breast seems larger than normal (it is normally larger than the left) and kinda mishapen. I asked my boyfriend and he says that it feels firmer and it has definatly changed it's shaped. I don't see any redness but it is very sore when I press on it and it is not hot to the touch. I do have an appointment in the morning but I am kinda nervous. I have only talked to my boyfriend about it because I don't want to worry anyone else until I know if I need to worry. But I am worried and kinda scared. I waited so long to make the appointment because I kept thinking it would just go away. I know it's not changes with my cycle because I had a hysterectomy when I was 25 due to endometriosis. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated as well any tips of what all goes on. I know the doctor plans to do a breast exam and a full physical. September Joy Log in to post a reply",
