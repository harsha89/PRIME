I will NOT be doing any more chemo (for brain death and fatigue reasons too though: I would rather be DEAD than ever again feel the way I felt when I was on chemo). But the \"hair thing\" was and still is a big baddie for me.  I mean once I finished the chemo, the constant crushing fatigue lifted, my GI tract normalized and I got a few of my marbles back, but my hair is STILL short! YUCK! Losing my hair was light years worse than losing my breasts. I didn't so much as open my apartment door, much less go OUT anywhere, without a wig on for well over a year -- but as soon as I got my drains out -- a week after my BMX, I started going out for walks and doing most of my regular business flat chested with a black T-shirt or other dark colored top and feeling only a little embarrassed about my chest sometimes. My pre-chemo hair was long (almost down to my waist), reddish-brown and a little bit wavy. I managed to find a wig which was ALMOST an exact duplicate to my real hair -- the same color exactly, but a little straighter (but I liked that) and a couple inches shorter (not a problem, since I liked the straightness enough to compensate for the missing couple of inches). So it's a great wig, and I looked Myself in it. There was a problem with it, though: due to my partial paralysis from my stroke, it was always a thoroughly frustrating wrestling match to get the thing on my head even! Still though, I've actually recently been tempted to wear it again because even though my real hair has been growing back, I just cannot stand the frickin' sight of myself with short hair.  My Pack Rat says I'm silly about \"the hair thing\" so I don't tell him, but I'll tell you -- when we go out together there are times I'm embarrassed and feel bad he has to be seen with me, because of my hair. It's only down to my neck at the longest part; the rest sticks out like I stuck a fork in an electric socket. I hate it. But I know that the only real solution (i.e., for me to look good with my real hair again) is to give it TIME for it to GROW BACK. If I live that long... :::::sigh::::",

This isn't to say my GI tract was otherwise normal (far from it!) or that I had no other SEs (I felt like total crap, just not nauseous or flu-ish kind of sick) -- but nausea and vomiting were the ONLY SEs they were able to prevent/control, and I simply got lucky not to end up with mouth sores and nail issues since I had everything ELSE. They prescribed Ativan (for \"anticipatory\" nausea, they said). I took the Ativan as directed: the day before chemo, the day of chemo, and the day after chemo, for all six rounds. They also gave me decadron prior to hooking up the chemo bags, and to take at home, they gave me Kytril at first, then Zofran, along with Compazine.",

Now I'm of the opinion that chemo is like smoking -- best not to start in the first place. Yes, I'd be dead now if I hadn't done it, but I'm kind of dead ANYWAY since the person I used to be is gone and never coming back.  Oh well, everyone makes mistakes, right?  ",

(nah nevermind, rhetorical question) Ummmm...I appreciate your intent so thank you, but....with all due respect, no thank you. I don't HAVE any \"spiritual beliefs\" of the kind I think you mean, and I don't find the idea of  meditation tapes or suggestions relaxing. Sometimes my PT says things while guiding me through an exercise which could go on a tape like that: I wish she wouldn't but it is what it is, and PT is only temporary. At best it makes me roll my eyes and shake my head (i.e., \"new agey wishy washy\"). When I do the exercises at home, I just get through them by counting the seconds for holding the various positions and counting reps to make sure I did them correctly, and enough. To know where my mind is at, think \"realist,\" \"skeptic,\" \"needs evidence, \"cynic\" and so on.  I know, many imaginative and creative people (and some scientists too; I used to be a microbiologist) DO believe in \"higher powers\" of whatever kind, but, faith in supernatural beings or powers is NOT a prerequisite to imagination and creativity. Dunno if there are any studies on that but I have some personal anecdotal evidence of an atheist and an agnostic who had extra helpings of creativity. LOL Before my stroke in 1993 which killed all the fine motor coordination in my left hand, I composed and recorded (and produced and occasionally performed seven albums of music. I played piano, synthesizers and 12-string acoustic guitar. A few years after the stroke I fell into being an amateur writer since I couldn't play music anymore, and wrote twelve sci fi fantasy novels. And don't ask how this happened, since I'm an ATHEIST, but ten of them are a series and the characters have a pantheistic religion to which they're extremely faithful. OK my co-author, who observes pagan spirituality, is the one who started them out with the basic religion, which I wouldn't have done, but once given the concept I ran with it...I was the one who fleshed it all out and invented most of the specific rituals to the various gods and goddesses. Go figure. But I used to have one HELL of an imagination. I wish it would come ALL the way back.... My Pack Rat (that's what I call my boyfriend LOL) is agnostic and has several patents as a mechanical designer -- betcha didn't know this but a decent grounding in physics, engineering and materials science-- which almost nobody automatically thinks of in conjunction with the term \"creativity\" -- combined with a good sense of how parts fit together -- mixed in the right proportions, is one of the main recipes for INVENTION. Can't get any more creative than THAT! LOL Well since I take my reality black with no milk or sugar, and, since reality mostly sucks -- even without cancer in the picture, I need to take BREAKS from it when it gets to be \"too much.\" I guess spiritual types would instead pray or meditate at those times because you believe God or whoever higher being can actually change reality for you by making it better or easier? I guess since I don't Believe, that's why I need my full functioning intellect and a good creative outlet -- so I can ESCAPE every now and then! My present escape has been good for the past five years actually. When  I hit 30,000 words into the 11th novel of my sci fi fantasy series, I discovered a computer game called The Sims (through a writing forum I was on). I tried it, got addicted and was able to use it to bring my own invented sci-fi fantasy people and their culture to life! I made my story characters into Sims and by totally hot-rodding the game itself with custom content (some of it which *I* made: I learned to \"hack\" game objects to make them do what *I* needed them to do). I've successfully created their homeworld surroundings and lifestyle, and am continually still making smaller, more streamlined, modifications to bring it even closer to the way I wrote it. When RL is \"too much,\" I go live there with them for awhile. And speaking of reality sucking: Yeah, chemo brain is unfortunately all too real! Even coming up on TWO YEARS PFC and also finally off the damn AIs (those are brain killers too -- consider yourself warned and be very, very afraid: they are almost as bad as chemo) I still only have 90-95% of my marbles back (and those need to be held together by Wellbutrin and Ritalin :-P) -- and by now I doubt I'll find the rest of them. Translation: my focus, concentration and intellect are mostly back (and occasionally I'm even having my \"old Me\" moments, i.e., flashes of brilliance or creativity), but I have almost no short term memory anymore and where I used to be able to multitask badly, now I can't multitask at all.  Back to the upcoming rads....it is what it is, and I accept them without the sugar coating. But that doesn't mean I have to LIKE them or put on the false cheerful smile in order to get them or for them to buy a little more time. Linda -- yup, my radiation oncologist told me I'll get tattooed at simulation. She had asked me if I felt claustrophobic in CT scanners; I don't and said so, then she mentioned I'd get a couple of tattoos. So I had to tell her that being scanned doesn't bother me even slightly (and I think MRIs in particular are cool LOL) but NEEDLES?! OUUUUCH I hate needles!!! There is no such thing as ANY kind of needle stick that doesn't hurt me like hell, unless I use EMLA cream or they give me a local (but then the needle for the local hurts almost as bad as the needle I had to get in the first place). I asked her where I should apply the EMLA cream before my sim, she showed me and I *WILL* be doing that! Of course it'll probably use up the rest of my tube to get it everyplace she told me they might be tattooing me so I'll probably need to request a new prescription from my PCP's APRN after the simulation. I hope the tattoos are only noticeable to the radiology technicians who apparently need them. Besides the fact that I don't like needles, there's a reason why I never got or ever wanted to get any kind of tattoos on my body. To others they seem decorative bits of personal self-expression and while  I wouldn't tell someone else what to do or not do about \"artwork\" on their own bodies, I don't like them at all personally...To my eyes tattoos are ugly mutilations and I don't want that on MY body.  :::::sigh::::: Well...off to the laundromat, with an iBook full of little simmies to keep me out of trouble.

One of the rad techs said she agreed with me when I said I didn't like tattoos, needles or want a pemanent reminder about this on my body. (you ask me, having no breasts is enough of a reminder huh?) Anyway, the nurse gave me two tubes of this cream called Jean's (I had never heard of it) to put on my skin after treatment, and if I use them both up, I'll get more. I also picked up some Ivory liquid body soap too. So looks like I'm as ready as I'm going to be. Oh, and my body did not fuss when it came to the positioning of my arms and holding them up/being still. ...I hate TVs in public places too Janet. Actually, I mostly hate TV anyway. My television set is solely a DVD/VCR player; I stopped watching \"current\" TV about a decade ago. So when I go to the medical center I bring my iBook (there's WIFI at the medical center) sometimes, sometimes I bring whatever book I'm reading at the moment...depends how long I have to be at the medical facility. Since it's a 60 mile round trip, I do the best I can to schedule all my various doctor visits, counseling sessions, treatments and tests to fall on the same day so I get it done in one trip. If the appointments are close (say a 11 AM and a 1 PM, I just bring a book (and eat lunch between appointments). If not so close (once I had a 10 AM, a 1:00 PM and a 4 PM on the same day) then I bring the iBook because I have plety of time to catch up with email and forums, or play my sims. Anyway, from now until July 12th, I am FREEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! No medical visits, no driving, no having to work around OTHER peoples' lives. So I get just over a week \"off\" from all this cancer crappity crap. Woo-HOO! Maybe finish Pasteurella's (which I'm thinking of renaming Salmonella's -- LOL MYUUUHAHAH!) and play my little simmies for hours on end.  Books...well Janet, when it comes to books, one woman's interesting can end up being another woman's boring, so you should probably choose and bring your own reading material as you see fit.  ",

Well fine ruin my frickin summer, I'm going to rebel this winter maybe, no more goddamn doctors and procedures because I will stay in the nice warm house (hey 60 is warm compared to the subzeros outside!) and flat out REFUSE to go outside in that cold brutal crap.

The sims I mean, not the rads: I know they only zap you for a short time when they give the actual rads. Thanks. Unlike you, though, I'm NOT anxious to get started. Oh, I'll do it when they tell me it's time, but no I don't look forward to it. See, even though I'm still in PT/working on getting my range of motion fully back from the BMX I had on 5/20, it's still a fact that now (the past six weeks or so) is the FIRST frickin time I have felt good in OVER TWO YEARS!!  I do NOT look forward to going back to fatigue, only this time maybe with a side order of radiation burns... and putting guck on my skin to HOPEFULLY prevent that (I'm skeptical, since I'm the Queen of Side Effects :-P). I hate putting creams/lotions on my body: I prefer to just shower and be clean and not have gunky creams on me (to me they're ALL yucky in some way) -- only time I use anything -- have an aloe/vitamin E one now -- but only use it when I have dry skin that irritates me worse than bothering with the cream/lotion -- which is only on my lower legs in winter and my hands after I wash dishes. Oh, and also there'll be the 60 mile round trip drive five days a week for what, a month or month and a half to get my rads. I would be very happy if I never had to drive ever again. :::::sigh::::: There's been times I've considered selling my car and I do run MOST of my errands on foot (I only drive when I absolutely have to -- I put on only 2,000 to 2,500 miles per year on my car: it's 5 years old, was new when I got it so it only has 12,000-something miles on it), but unfortunately I do still need to drive at least a little, even beyond going to the medical center...oh well....  :::::sigh:::::",

I originally figured a female GYNECOLOGIST would certainly understand about \"those\" kinds of examinations way more than a male doctor, so I went to a woman gynecologist once, and SHE's the one who shoved a TOTALLY COLD speculum up there to examine me!!! :-O After that, I went back to men doctors for many years. Until I moved recently (October 2010) I had ALL men doctors -- and was totally okay with that until mid-2010 or so, then I got to that \"well a man, even if he IS a doctor, can't REALLY understand this as well as a woman, can he? Especially since I felt my (male) oncologist at the time didn't really take me seriously and I even more strongly sense it was because, being in my late 40s, I was an \"older woman\") mindset. When I moved, though, it turned out all my new doctors were women. I only have one male APRN on my \"medical team\" -- he \"belongs to\" my new PCP who is a woman. I like him a LOT and he \"feels\" like a \"real doctor\"; he reminds me of a younger version of my PCP from before I moved. But, I still think the new PCP is terrific. I definitely like the women doctors better, they do take me more seriously, or at least THESE ones do, or maybe it just feels that way. Which is, I suppose, as good as it gets for someone like me. I'm not people-savvy so I lack \"people-skills\" and end up wrong more than right when it comes to \"reading\" people. But they're listening to me and finally coming around to the fact that I don't need or want for them to help me try to \"fight a battle\" I can't win, but rather I need them to make it possible for me to live as well as I can for whatever time I have left: living WELL is higher priority for me than how LONG I live. So I hope the rads don't take me down for too long before imparting whatever improvement they're supposed to impart, or prevent for longer the bad stuff that takes me down worse, or whatever it is.....you know, the \"I'm doing this WHY?\" thing...other than because my Pack Rat still somehow wants me around and is way in agreement with the two doctors who can now drag me bodily into the radiation chamber. LOL Gma Foley -- now that you're almost done with your rads -- how are you and your skin holding up? Lab Rat minds want to know.  :-) Squeeeek. =====(    )8:>  So what's with my brain now? Why'd I say I bought Ivory unscented liquid body soap to shower with during rads? I just noticed it was Dove, not Ivory. Well, no matter:  the rads nurse said either Ivory or Dove would be good.

So now I got a question for you: is your bolus cold when they first put it on your body? I ask because my rads techs are always apologizing \"sorry this is going to be cold\" when they first apply my bolus. It's COOL, yeah, but it doesn't feel uncomfortably cold, so I don't mind it. In fact, sometimes it even feels good. yorelh -- oooh YEAH like I needed the reminder that today is Hump Day! Gotta give my Pack Rat a call! LOL. Hell, it's the only time I seem to have ANY energy anymore. ;-) I'm having 13/33 today at 11:45 so I have about another hour before I have to get going to the cancer center.....if anything eventful happens, I'll be back. It occurs to me that I could use some of this time going for a short walk but I woke up today feeling exhausted to the point where eating a nice light no-cook breakfast (yogurt and bowl of raisin bran) was \"work.\" I had planned to eat a nectarine too, but when I finished the yogurt and cereal I was tired and not in the mood to eat any more. And I love nectarines! Anyway maybe now I can begin to point the finger at rads for making me this tired, rather than the kidney issues: almost all my swelling from that is gone! My fat jeans (which I had originally thought I'd given to the thrift shop along with the other 95% of my \"old\" clothes but thank goodness I didn't -- so now I'll keep them and call them my \"illness\" jeans) are now once again too big and the skinny ones fit me again. They're a little tight still but the \"illness\" ones are considerably looser on me -- fall down on me --  than the skinny ones are tight (it's easy to put them on and zip up, but the button is a little rough going); I guess I need a few more days yet to FINISH getting rid of all that extra fluid I had! But whatever it is, even though I got a decent night's sleep (no wakeup coughing fits since I took the Nyquil before bed last night), have eaten breakfast and had morning coffee, I feel as though I were hit by a truck and I am SO TIRED and not in the mood to do ANYTHING. But I have to get my rads, and after rads, I have an appointment with my counselor. (Probably a lost cause, but I'll see what I can do... LOL) I know it's hard but try to stay awake!  ",

Since the rads nurse had told me that if I put cream on after showering but before bed, my chest would still be considered \"clean\" for the next day's treatment, I put on some more Jean's cream. Not as much as earlier (I cannot stand any kind of gooey \"stuff\" on my body after I shower) but some because I hope to forestall any more opportunities to feel REALLY lousy. Guess you figured it out by now that I don't shower in the morning. I take just about all my showers at night (a few in the late afternoon if plans get different) -- anywhere from 8-9 PM usually). Most folks say a morning shower wakes them up and energizes them -- not me. Evening showers are sooo relaxing and make me feel like I'm washing the day off me. I like to spend the evening/go to bed clean and in clean jammies. Morning showers make me homicidal (at least the two I took in the past did). All I wanna know about in the morning is sleeping as late as I can and then my COFFEE! And sitting there slowly drinking it reading on the computer while it dispels my morning coma. To hell with that get up earlier so there's TIME for a shower crap too! LOL Coraeliz, you should put the cream on all your radiation fields. Yes, clavicles, armpits, mastectomy area sounds right for you. I do halfway up my neck though. My other fields are both mastectomy areas (I had a BMX) plus a bit below where my right breast used to be, on the skin over my right ribcage. No armpits for me though. I wouldn't let them near my nodes. Pejkug...OK \"good\" I guess, I'm not the only Graffiti Girl here. LOL. But yeah, some medical staffers are pretty dense, huh? Most were at my former facility, but after I moved and had to get all new, I found that the new place and new doctors/nurses/technicians are MUCH better and more cognizant of patient preferences.  Hmmmm, I was also told not to swim in chlorinated pools (fat chance of that happening anyway -- who is dumb enough to think I'd be wearing a bathing suit in public anyway?) and be careful about excess sun exposure. Since I don't swim and other than (weather and my energy level permitting) my daily or almost daily walks, I'm mostly a creature of the Great Indoors anyway. I became a sun avoider back in my 20s because I have fair skin which burns quickly and badly, so no swimming or sunbathing isn't a problem for me. It does kind of bother me that I have to wear \"high collar\" T-shirts though -- no blouses or tank tops which show the clavicle area since I'm being irradiated there too. Even though I'm only outside when I \"have to\" be, I do realize that even what minimal sun exposure I get might be \"too much\" for the radiation areas. This hit me this morning when I was getting dressed to go out for treatment. I was going to wear one of my black tank tops, but it showed off too much clavicle! LOL. I'm trying to get in the habit quickly.",

They called to tell me this yesterday morning. OK, so more free time to feel good, right? No dammit, I had to get a kidney infection! If I'm sounding even crankier than I usually am (and I know, that's pretty damn cranky LOL) it's because I got NO SLEEP AT ALL last night -- the pain was so bad; I took my sleeping pills, went to bed and hoped I'd pass out, but couldn't it hurt too much. My Pack Rat ended up having to take me to the emergency room (at 1-something AM). So that's how I know it was a kidney infection. Given the nature and location of the pain, I was really surprised by that diagnosis: I'd thought it was either a blocked bowel or appendicitis! Well the pain meds (they gave me Dilaudid in an IV while there plus Zofran since I was also nauseous), then Percocet pils to take at home) work completely and I'm picking up an antibiotic at the pharmacy in a little while, so hopefully I'll kick this bugger's butt quickly enough so I can enjoy most of the \"extra\" few days before rads. Oh, and that's great you have such an understanding radiation oncologist too. Did he tell you what kind of cancer he'd had? Enjoy your free time! Live while you can!  :-)  Pejkug, my radiation oncologist said no deodorant during rads unless I use cornstarch or Tom's (which she had to explain to me since I'd never heard of it). I'll look into finding out where to buy the Tom's, but...I know this is going to sound gross maybe but I think I'll be OK with just showering regularly and just taking a break from deodorant until I finish rads. I've been using Secret stick deodorants for years, but truth be told, ever since my estrogen dried up from chemo and AIs, I don't think I really \"need\" deodorant anymore, not like I used to. I just don't \"smell\" as much! I don't get it -- before I had chemo, at the end of the day I KNEW I NEEDED to take a shower in a big way (I take NIGHTLY showers), but since then, unless it's really hot and I've been really physically active, I hardly even smell at all anymore (and not very BADLY). Weird huh? Well, OK, so I maintained my same shower rituals from habit and also because I sometimes wanted to ENJOY a nice cool (or nice hot) shower, including continuing to use the Secret deodorant anyway (currently still using it since my rads haven't started yet) after losing my estrogen, but only because I think it smells nice on its own merit. So, I'm going to see how it goes with just my nightly showers only, and THEN get some Tom's if it turns out I estimate wrong on on this one.",

Other than that, NO, I do NOT want to be seen naked, and I DO find it upsetting. Alas my treatment center is academic, so they like to bring students in to watch. For some stupid reason, THAT really bothers me. Well, it didn't at first -- I used to think \"well how the hell do the doctors LEARN?\" and kind of roll my eyes in consent, but now when a doc brings a student in for an exam or whatever where I have to be partly naked I actually sound like a little kid -- \"Do you HAVE TO?\" Sometimes they respect my wishes, other times they talk me into a resigned \"OK....\" in a tone of voice that makes it plain I don't like it. (you know, like a little kid who \"agrees\" to clean her room in order to be allowed to do something she likes.) And oh yeah, I don't like the side effects thing either. I feel good now (finally all rehabilitated and fully functional post-BMX, and happily way off meds that were making me totally miserable) for the first time in over two years and I don't trust doctors who tell me I'll \"tolerate it well\" or \"it's better than chemo,\" or \"you'll only be a LITTLE tired, and IF you have skin changes it'll be closer to the end of the treatments\" because they're usually WAAAAY OFFFFF -- so I am in NO hurry to go from feeling good to feeling like shit. Oh, and I also HATE to drive. It's a 60 mile round trip to the treatment center.

I used to LOVE to swim in the ocean as a child, teenager and just into my early 20s at which point I couldn't handle those horrible sunburns anymore and quit going to the beach....and learned to spend more of my free time cultivating my INDOOR hobbies and interests until I got to the point where I not only liked more indoor than outdoor activities, but most of the time actually preferred not to even leave my apartment since the stuff I liked doing best of all could all be done indoors at home! (That \"cured\" my sunburn problem COMPLETELY, FOR GOOD. LOL) And y'know I TOLD my RO at our first appointment (before rads actually started) about how my very fair and sensitive skin which always used to badly painfully burn, peel, repeatedly painfully burn and peel, turn white again ad nauseam (I never EVER tanned even slightly) back in the days before I wised up and started deliberately hiding from the sun made me apprehensive about radiation treatment, and she ASSURED ME (?!) that fair skinned patients don't fare any differently in radiation treatment than olive skinned or dark skinned patients in terms of \"skin changes,\" as she termed them (sure makes it sound a lot \"better\" than the truth, doesn't it? GRRRR!)......... I guess I should just be happy my skin doesn't stick to my clothes when I take them off huh? Well I'll sure have something to say to the technicians and nurse when I go back to rads tomorrow, like \"I NEED A BIGGER PRESCRIPTION FOR EMLA CREAM! NOW! TODAY!\" (before I use it all up on something other than why I normally use it)... Oh and now I'm down to my last two tubes of Jeans cream too so will need to ask for resupply on that too. :::::sigh:::: ",

Sooooo, drumroll please... My first side effect from rads IS......... COUGHING!  Yes, coughing! :-O My entire chest wall is being irradiated, and small amounts of radiation are getting to my lungs (can't avoid it). RO said some patients getting what I'm getting could develop a dry cough from it. It started late Saturday afternoon, wasn't too bad and I didn't think much of it. But yesterday from around midday on it was really bad, I was having all these coughing fits on and off, and THEN I thought \"Rads? Maybe...\" They stopped awhile (early evening) but overnight last night was awful. My Pack Rat was here so my multiple overnight major coughing fits woke HIM up as well as ME! At which time I decided to point the finger at the rads on this one (I don't smoke and I don't have a cold/flu). So, after today's zap, I asked one of the rads nurses if it would be OK for me to buy an OTC cough suppressant/which one, or if she could prescribe me one she preferred.  She said she preferred to consult with the RO -- who wasn't in today of course -- on that and would call me later today to let me know \"OK, go ahead and buy such-and-such\" or \"We called in a prescription cough medicine to your pharmacy.\" It's 4:33 PM now, so I'm still waiting for the call. My pharmacy is close and open till 6:30 so I can wait a little bit yet. No noticeable skin changes yet that I can see (I'll just keep on slathering my body with that Jean's cream!), and though I do feel tired/totally no energy (unless my Pack Rat motivates me...heh heh), well, since I don't know which is more likely to cause fatigue: recovery from near kidney failure or radiation treatment, I don't yet know where to point THAT finger.",

I've also heard about how users have to  apply periodically throughout the day. Normally I use a Secret stick deodorant, will probably resume after I recover from rads. For now though, I still shower each night so I don't give a flying horsecrap if someone thinks I smell -- I don't smell BO on me. I wasn't using the Secret because *I* thought I smelled bad. As far as I'm concerned, anybody who takes a shower or bath at least once every 24 hours probably does NOT \"need\" deodorants, I was using it because I liked the actual scent of it, not because I was trying to hide BO which I didn't even have.",

It's probably reasonable to say that I'm coming into that \"SEs are possibly starting now\" window but I have no idea if I feel like shit (no physical energy tired, fuzzy-headed, and barely interested in ANYTHING) because I'm still recovering from the Mystery Ureter Blockage or if it's really rads fatigue beginning to set in.

I get a total of four daily bolus zaps: two zaps with it on the left and two zaps with it on the right, in addition to the numerous other zaps in all fields without it. What it's supposed to do is keep the radiation actually in your skin, instead of it hitting slightly below. Dunno yet how much bolus I'll get with the boosts, but I guess I'll find out soon enough... 20/33 for me today, and YES!! ENOUGH ALREADY! I'm ready for the weekend -- two days of NOT having to drive 60 miles -- or ANYWHERE for that matter! I almost think the driving is the worst part of this (tied for #1 with the driving or a close second would be the fatigue). I just hit the 15,000 miles on my car \"milestone\" yesterday. But this will actually show you how much I dislike driving and that I only do it when ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY: Shuttlecraft T'Kiri is a 2006 Toyota Corolla and I got her brand new, and now it's 2011, and I only just reached 15,000 miles. This is also the first year I've put on more than 2,000 to 2,500 miles -- thanks to a 300 mile move, a couple times letting my Pack Rat use the car, the fact that the supermarket is now 12 miles away from where I live instead of 2 like at my former residence, lots of doctor appointments and the med center being 60 miles round trip that I have to drive instead of 4 with THEIR transportation van (my former cancer center had transportation service for patients) and now the Mon-Fri rads, the miles are now starting to pile on. Believe it or not though, I'm actually way better off living here than I was before, and even though I still don't like to drive, at least I'm not so totally scared shitless of it anymore like where I was before. Yup I'm going to enjoy being able to stay home this weekend. :-) I wonder if I'll have the energy to go for a walk.......",

She says my chest looks vastly better now than it did last week, and in another two weeks, the remaining \"broken blister scabs\" should be all gone. I showed her all the skin mets, including the two in the irradiated area and told her I wasn't so sure the rads had been worth the loss of my summer and all the side effects, but she firmly believes that had I NOT done the rads, I'd be in far WORSE shape than I am with regards to the skin mets (which is also what my Pack Rat suggested last night when I showed them to HIM) -- as in there'd be even MORE, and they would also be bigger (they're little nodule-bump thingies, about 20 or so below the radiated area plus the two in the radiated area), as in really tumor sized.. So OK, maybe it wasn't a total waste to have the rads, but I was SO upset that I ended up with BOTH the ruined summer AND the skin mets.  Well, in a couple weeks I'm seeing the \"regular\" oncologist again and THEN will be time to deal with the skin mets. My Pack Rat shocked the hell out of her (the RO) I think, with all the questions he had about the radiation machine/treatment dosage and techniques -- like gamma knife and arc as compared to the external beam treatments I got; he wanted to know if those could be used on the skin mets; she said it was possible but not practical, and that systemic treatment like anti-hormonals, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or chemo were preferable at this point. That part I was already aware of though, but I'm glad he got to hear that from a doctor, and the conversation was certainly interesting. Also he's now satisfied on the subject that I didn't get an accidental overdose (i.e., there are records that the technicians programmed the machine correctly with the dose I was supposed to have), and yes, these sudden escalations from just red with minor to moderate itch and burn to full on painful as hell second degree burns with blisters like I had CAN and DO occasionally happen towards the end of rads even when the patient has always been given the correct dosage. She wants to see me one more time (in a month). My Pack Rat doesn't have to come with me for THAT appointment, but he will go to the \"regular\" oncologist with me in a couple weeks.",

Since the Dayquil had the same cough suppressant, I decided I didn't want to cough during the day either and bought this double package. Muuuuch better.",

In order, my present \"regimen\" is cortisone cream, Jeans cream and then Aquaphor.  Ewwwwww, I just wanna feel clean and dry again! I guess it's now obvious that I was never a fan of body lotions!  GiGi what day did you start? My first one was July 18th. ",

When she finished zapping me for today, the tech said they're done with the supraclavicular area and all the rest of my treatments will be to the chest wall only, and she'd be using the bolus alot. OK, yeah, I suppose I'm soon to approach the light at the end of this tunnel, after which time I get scanned and my onc and I decide when to start me on the Faslodex. Hey mimidi, I wish I was you and could say that after I got through the rads, I wouldn't have to have more treatment. I wish I could just be left alone with this crap already. But since my Pack Rat still wants me alive, and there's still one more treatment left I'm willing to have, maybe I can buy a little more time. Hiya Polly. Kleenex, huh? Now why didn't I think of that? Well, I have a strange way of doing things. When I go to treatment I lay out my \"tubes of sludge\" and grab a handful of paper towels and leave that all there on the table with my shirt. After being zapped, in this order I smear cortisone cream, Jeans cream and Aquafor -- yup one on top of the next, ALL OVER from ribcage to lower neck. Then I wipe the gook off my hands with the paper towels so I can put my shirt on/throw the tubes back in my purse.  If I get itchy or burny later in the day once I'm home (luckily not often) I reapply.  Then of course after my nightly shower, gotta redo the whole thing since all the cream gets washed off. But here's the weird part...since I use a couple of wash cloths as both a \"tub mat\" so I don't slip when I shower (and also as a foot washer), well, I have to wring them, so I got in the habit of wringing them out and hanging them up with the towels AFTER I apply the night gook and put my PJs on. That gets my hands nice and clean. LOL GiGiL, yeah, I'm one day ahead of you. Sorry about your red armpit. If it makes you feel less lonely, no more pink for me, today 75% of my entire torso is definitely \"sunburn red,\" even though I'm fairly diligent about using all the creams.  Denimblue -- GOOD GOING!! I bet \"relieved\" doesn't even begin to describe how you must feel about being done with your rads. Jan, well, I guess you like driving, huh? 130,000 miles on a 2004 car, if those are all your miles (mine are), that's about 18,000 miles per year. Way more than I hope to be doing. I had a coworker who had a Prius and since Shuttlecraft Nevasa, my car at that time (a couple of months prior to my getting Shuttlecraft T'Kiri) was broken down in the shop yet again, he gave me a ride home after work, so I've gotten to ride in a Prius. Amazing, that \"total nothing\" when stopped at a red light. LeeLee, OUCH. Your posts about your skin side effects are just as scary as pejkug's were! Funny, during today's treatment I actually asked the technician if there was a chance I'd make it out of this without peeling, and she said yes.",

I thought I read a month after finishing rads...a whole month!). Except for the fact that rads aren't interfering with the taste of food, my current eating habits are a lot like when I was doing chemo.....breakfast cereal, instant oatmeal, microwaved canned soup, yogurt, various fruits and sandwiches -- and lots of paper plates so I don't have to do dishes more than once every 2-3 days. Oh, there's something here I didn't have where I was before I moved (which was where I was when I was on chemo) -- a store on the way home from rads has takeout fried chicken, so occasionally I stop there and get a couple drumsticks or thighs, bring 'em home and put 'em on a paper plate. I think that, and the oatmeal, are the only HOT meals I've had in maybe 3 weeks so far.",

Since I'm medically disqualified for recon (IBC with skin involvement), I'd briefly considered being fitted with prostheses, which would obviously require me to wear a bra.

Today in fact I just noticed I have a couple of blisters just under my right arm where the band of a bra would pass. Noticed 'em while putting on the creams before getting dressed this morning.

No improvement to the second degree burns I showed the rads nurse and one of the doctors on Monday morning, so my own RO got to see them in full force for herself for today, although as it happens, apparently whatever the nurse and other doc had told her made her decide to tell my MO, and today with \"confirmation\" (my RO seeing it herself as compared to secondhand information from that nurse and other doctor), the decision is: NO MORE RADS. I \"only\" had 25/33 but I'm done. My skin just wasn't up to it, and RO says now my MO wants me to recover from the rads so she can put me on the Faslodex. RO gave me these saline and other dressings and said twice a day (morning and afternoon) I should lie down with them covering the burned areas for half an hour at a time, plus a tube of silver sulfadiazine cream -- when I don't have the dressings on I should have that cream on instead, and if I run out they'll call in more to my pharmacist. And, she wants to see me again next Thursday to see how I'm healing. OK......that works.   Elizabeth and Barb -- you're finished -- and you were somehow able to get through ALL the treatments you were originally scheduled for? Wow... congratulations!! Oh, and Elizabeth, don't worry about the whining -- I did plenty of that myself! LOL GigiL -- why not try the gel strips the nurse gave you? They sound OK to me, anyway, I'd at least try them if I was in your position. LindaJanette -- yeah, lidocaine cream is only good for 3-4 hours tops. I discovered that over the weekend when I used my EMLA cream (a lidocaine-prilocaine mix actually) on my own radiation burns. Got another form of relief for pain and itching of rads burns from the nurse I saw on Monday: she suggested I take both benadryl and ibuprofen. Benadryl helps the itching, ibuprofen helps the pain/inflammation. Of course, you have to take THOSE every 4 hours too though. But I tried it and it does help, so I'm still going to take them in addition to applying the soothing bandages and using the silver sulfadiazine cream.",

That stuff will just about make you sorry you were ever even born. The only thing that's worse than aromatase inhibitors (I've done them ALL) is cytotoxic chemotherapy. Which brings me to.... Jan -- Faslodex is an estrogen blocker which works similarly to Tamoxifen (i.e., it blocks estrogen receptors on tumor cells so the estrogen can't get in and feed the tumor), but it doesn't carry the same risk of blood clots as Tamoxifen does.  Polly, when you finish your rads, I can promise you will DEFINITELY find that you have better things to do than drive several hours a day to and from rads! ",

He was thinking maybe on my last treatment I'd gotten accidentally overdosed with too much radiation, so he told me to ask my RO, which I did (last Wednesday when I showed her my burned up skin initially and she said we were stopping treatment). Tomorrow is the followup with my RO since she saw my badly burned skin last week and my Pack Rat is coming with me because he didn't like the answer I got to the question about too many rads by mistake. When I asked, the RO had said \"Not possible, the machine would automatically shut down if the input dosage was incorrect.\" Maybe that's right and I don't know enough about physics to know better, but my Pack Rat says this bears further conversation. So since HE apparently knows the right questions to ask, he's coming with me. Anyway -- for the first few days after seeing my RO last week I used the special bandages and gel, plus the cortisone and silver sulfa-whatever cream, and you know, not only did I not feel better, but it actually got WORSE: somehow numerous more blisters began to appear. So between that and hating feeling so gucky all the time with all that crap on my body, I STOPPED using EVERYTHING except the benadryl and ibuprofen for the pain and itch. I'm still red and most of the blisters have broken and I've started peeling, but fine, it's not getting worse, the blisters breaking on their own and the peeling are early signs of starting to heal a bit, and most of all, at least I'm not greasy gooey anymore and THAT is a MAJOR improvement in how I feel overall. I'm still using the Dove sensitive skin/unscented body wash in the shower, still taking cool to lukewarm showers and not letting shower stream directly hit my chest (no hot showers or direct water on my chest at all -- in fact, I haven't taken a HOT or direct-chest shower in several months now, not since the night before my BMX in May so I kind of forget what that's like by now), and still not back to using deodorant, but at least now when I take a shower I feel CLEAN. Now if only all that (the rads and SEs) hadn't been for nothing. Yup you heard me right -- the treatment didn't even work so my whole summer was ruined by coughing, fatigue (finally just starting to lift a little as of the last 2 days), radiation burns and all that frickin driving for nothing. You should see the major crop of those little nodule skin mets I have now; they all started popping up within the last few days, and two of them (so far) are in one of the most irradiated areas.   ::::sigh:::: How are your boosts going, Gigi? ",

I'll never take them again. What happened was that as soon as I finished chemo, my oncologist put me on Tamoxifen, which I seemed to be doing fine on and it was keeping me stable. Unfortunately, when I'd been taking the Tamoxifen for 5 months I developed a deep vein thrombosis in my splenic portal vein. It was totally asymptomatic, I had no idea I had it. My onc found it on one of my routine cancer scans. So no more Tamoxifen; he started me on Femara and the 16 months of hell began. AIs were so awful for me (I could only just BARELY tolerate them on an antidepressant, which only partially helped and of course couldn't stop the horrible joint pains, hurting hands and feet, and feeling like a 90-year-old). I was actually GLAD I had PROGRESSION because that made my oncologist say I could go off it (I was on Arimidex at the time). How bad is THAT? Oh and I'm also on Coumadin for the DVT. Fun fun fun!

Never had rads so I'm unqualified to touch your first question, but I can respond to your question #2, to a point anyway, as in yes I'm (newly) postmenopausal -- I was perimenopausal at diagnosis but the chemo pushed me into full fledged menopause -- I'm Stage IV, and I was on Tamoxifen for several months (end of July 2009 to middle of March 2010). I finished my chemo on 7.23.09 (6 rounds of Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxotere) and started Tamoxifen on 7.30.09. I was doing mostly OK on the Tamoxifen so I thought -- I was \"having an affair with the stable boy\" and had only minor SEs from the Tamox (hot flashes and weight gain), except I ended up developing a deep vein thrombosis! My oncologist took me off the Tamoxifen on 3.15.10 and for the last 3 weeks coming up on 4 I've had to have daily Lovenox injections (OUCH!). This week he decided to try to transition me from Lovenox to Coumadin, so right now I still get the shots and I'm taking a Coumadin tablet each evening, plus he also put me on Femara, which I started this week also (same time as the Coumadin; Monday 4.5.10). Tomorrow I'm having a blood test and hopefully no more injections -- depends on my platelet count and INR. Maybe I should mention, with regards to my DVT and being taken off the Tamoxifen; my oncologist had ordered a thrombophilia panel (tests for clotting issues/genetic predilection to have them) for me, and in addition to an elevated risk factor for blood clots from Tamoxifen, I came up positive for three mutations which predispose me to clotting whether I take Tamoxifen or not, so I think it's possible that it was the COMBINATION of my predisposition towards and being on a medication which can induce clots which caused this to happen to me, as in, maybe you'll be OK on Tamoxifen. How was it for you when you took it 6 years ago? My oncologist says that Femara has a lower risk of clotting than Tamoxifen, so that's why he put me on it. Having only just started it Monday, I think it's too early to tell if I'll have any Femara-specific SEs yet. (oh no I hope I don't gain any MORE freakin' weight!) ~Lena. ",

Oh yeah, cinammon swirl bread....dunno if it was a Pepperidge Farm one or what, but there used to be this cinnamon-RAISIN bread I was totally and completely nuts about. Funny thing is I recognize it when I see it in the store, but don't remember the brand off the top of my head. I had stopped buying it a few years before BC andchemo, though, because when I did used to buy it, I would eat it NONSTOP out of control, which isn't a good thing to do when you don't want to gain weight! So since I couldn't eat it in moderation, I stopped buying it altogether. Sometimes when I see it in the store it \"stops\" me, I look at it longingly for a few moments and think \"maybe just this once,\" but I end up just buying my rye, wheat and pumpernickel. I don't know what it was about that cinnamon raisin bread which set me off like that, but it, and corn muffins (which I also had to stop buying...but now I get fantasies of baking them, and I don't bake!), are the only sweets which have that kind of power over me. The others I'm content to either not eat at all (I don't even LIKE 99% of candy or ice cream), or eat in moderation. Jen -- ohgarsh, you DO know what i was talking about when I called it Sewer Mouth! Gross isn't it! I do NOT miss Taxotere (or adriamycin or cytoxan, come to think of it). I know what you mean about the \"white diet\" thing but cream of chicken SOAP?? LOL I know, that was a typo, but not only did I find it funny, but also it elicited an interesting mental image of eating soap, but hey for all we know, soap would probably taste GOOD on Taxotere, seeing how actual food didn't! SpecialK, I rarely had the energy to cook steak or chicken, but since I COULD eat chicken and knew the protein in it wouldn't kill me, I would do it maybe once per round. Even though I could eat burgers, which are quicker to cook than either chicken or steak, I only ate them a couple times because of the bread issue, until closer to the end anyway. Towards the end, though (starting maybe halfway through 4th or maybe early 5th round) I chanced it and bought a package of hamburger buns. Fortunately, I was able to eat THOSE even though I couldn't eat regular bread, so with this discovery,  I started to eat hamburgers regularly. I never cooked steak on chemo though, I was afraid of a \"texture\" issue like I had with bread, and steak is too expensive for me to take chances on wasting (I live alone and also don't have any pets I could have given it to if I didn't like it). So I got my protein from eggs (mostly: I ate an egg almost every day), chicken (a few times), cheese (occasionally), tunafish (occasionally -- I'd eat it on veggie crackers or by dipping celery stalks into it since I couldn't eat my usual sandwiches or tuna melts, and it wasn't \"right\" on the hamburger buns even though the burgers were! go figure) and hamburgers (a lot, in those latter rounds). I am normally a total salad fiend, but while I was on chemo, the THOUGHT of it was mysteriously revolting so I didn't eat ANY salad on chemo. :-O That was a big shock. But yeah thankfully after chemo I went back to being a salad fiend.",

The only time I got any relief from it was for five minutes, 3x a day when I brushed my teeth with Biotene toothpaste and rinsed out my mouth with Biotene mouthwash. Needless to say, I had major taste issues. The worst of my actual food issues was being unable to eat any bread! Weird huh? Well when I was on chemo, bread had no taste and it also felt like cardboard in my mouth. That really upset me to no end because without bread, there are no sandwiches! I mean I had severe fatigue and was not in the mood to COOK, and sandwiches, which I usually REALLY LIKE, are also fast and easy to make -- perfect chemo meals, I thought, but as it turned out, I couldn't eat them because I couldn't eat bread. GRRRRR. The good news, though, was that eventually the Sewer Mouth went away and my taste buds came back. Was able to use \"normal\" toothpaste and started to enjoy eating, including sandwiches.  I ended up enjoying eating TOO much for awhile actually.  I maintained my weight DURING chemo, but AFTER chemo I ate like a pig for several months and then had to lose 30 pounds!  :-( ",

I wish I could say it gets better. I'm coming up on two years PFC and the longest part of my hair only just touches the bottom of my neck, and on the sides it flares out and looks completely ridiculous, as if I, yes, stuck a fork in an electric socket.  Seeing how my goal is to  grow it back LONG (at LEAST to halfway down my back, would like to see waist length again but I think it's probably dicey to think I'll live long enough to even get it past my shoulders!), cutting is not the answer for me. There's nothing I can really do except endure and give it time. It doesn't make me look good in the meanwhile, though.   :-{ :::::sigh::::: ",

      "Content": "Sep 5, 2011 11:23AM - edited Sep 5, 2011 11:24AM by Lena Avery, if your doctor isn't recommending a mastectomy for you, my guess is it's due to the mets in the chest wall and ribs as much or more than what sounds like is a pretty big tumor in your breast -- 8 cm huh? :-( When I was diagnosed in Feb 2009, in addition to the ginormous 12 cm tumor in my right breast, I had mets in the mediastinal/intermammary nodes (which are in the chest wall) as well as a met in my left iliac bone. First, the onc told me I would have to have \"neo-adjuvant\" chemo (chemo BEFORE mastectomy) because the large size of my breast tumor plus having chest wall involvement made a mastectomy impossible; the cancer had to be shrunk down to operable proportions first. That would have been the case even if all I had was the breast and chest wall nodes, WITHOUT the distant bone met, which of course I did have. So OK, I had \"neoadjuvant\" chemotherapy. After the four months of hell on 6 round of TAC (I will NEVER do chemo again, I'd rather be dead than have to feel the way I did on that stuff!), though, the oncologist told me that mastectomy was not standard of care for Stage IV patients (i.e., there was no evidence of increase of survival time between Stage IV patients who'd had, or not had, a mastectomy) -- so even though the chemo had shrunk my breast tumor from 12 cm to a nicely operable 4 cm, significantly reduced the metabolic activity of the met in my left iliac bone, AND had totally cleaned out the mets in the chest wall nodes, he put me on anti-hormonal therapy (Tamox for 5 months until I had to stop it because it gave me a blood clot, then AIs). He said that IF tumor should begin to break out of the skin on my breast (which it hadn't done), THEN a mastectomy would be appropriate for me. I can't even begin to tell you how pissed off I was, and still get whenever I think about it! Originally I did not want chemotherapy AT ALL and only let myself be talked into it because it seemed to be a necessary prerequisite to the mastectomy.  So if surgery is not standard of care for me since I'm metastatic, WHY THE F*** DIDN'T HE TELL ME THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE?! Um, and this was only after my Pack Rat talked me into going to a doctor at all and telling me how I might find financial help to do it (the economy had eaten my job, I couldn't afford COBRA or seem to get another job since all the resumes I sent out were disappearing into a void, I had no insurance and only unemployment checks to pay the rent and eat; next thing you know a few months after THAT is when my breast starts turning into a rock). I was going to just let nature take its course and just die. I \"knew\" it was cancer; all I needed a doctor for was to tell me what kind, how far along it was and how much time I had left since \"even if I wanted to be treated, I can't afford it anyway.\" Everything I knew about cancer treatments -- from watching a friend of my father who'd had it plus my own research into more \"modern\" treatments -- screamed to me \"Cancer is horrible, but the TREATMENT is even WORSE!\" But, I digress. I have, however, had both a BMX and radiation. A year and a half after my original diagnosis I moved to another state a few hundred miles away (Oct 2010), and as such ended up with new doctors in a new treatment facility. My new oncologist believes that mastectomy for Stage IV patients DOES increase survival time and also improves QOL (BTW, QOL is my ONLY interest here. I would rather live six consecutive good months than ten on and off lousy years with the sprinkling in of a good day or a good week once or twice a year), and, because of the type of BC I have -- inflammatory breast cancer (IBC); which primary distinguishing characteristic in comparison to other BCs is the fact of skin involvement (i.e., cancer in the dermal lymphatics) -- believed that radiation treatment would postpone my getting new skin mets for several months. Wish I could say they were right about all this, but I'm not so sure. Yes, absolutely, and much to my (pleasantly, for once) shocked surprise, the SURGERY was by far and away the easiest of ALL the treatments I've had (in terms of SEs/recovery time) and is the ONLY cancer treatment I do NOT regret having had. Whether it was because of reduced tumor burden thanks to the surgery or finally being off AIs and free of the horrific side effects I had on THOSE, I can't say since I went off AIs in March and had the BMX in May, so maybe these benefits overlapped. But it's definitely true that after the surgery, once I got my full range of motion back (I had PT so it only took 3 weeks to a month), I felt good for the first time since BEFORE TREATMENT -- for a couple of weeks -- and I mean REALLY and TRULY felt GOOD, NOT \"I feel good CONSIDERING...\" Obviously it didn't last -- for reasons that couldn't DEFINITELY be pinpointed -- three weeks of GI problems and excruciating flank pain which only the IV dilaudid in the ER could dispel, and then I \"suddenly\" ended up with kidney failure due to ureter blockage (the POSSIBLE CAUSE of the blockage is the part which is probably dismal: metastasis to the retroperitoneum). So two days into my rads I also had 9 horrible days in the hospital, double nephrostomies, IVs to flush me out, then they stented the ureters open so I'm OK from that now, but as soon as I was beginning to recover from it, SEs from the rads -- which I ended up not being able to finish due to the second degree burns and huge blisters on my chest; was supposed to have had 33 treatments but was too burned up as of treatment #25 -- started to hit big time. As of this writing I'm only just starting to come up from the rads (as in my appetite and energy are now slowly coming back, and I'm coughing less), and yeah I'm shedding so much skin with all the peeling now, I feel like a snake. Oh, and also I got a whole brand new crop of skin mets ANYWAY (the originals were surgically removed during my BMX) -- even in the areas which were irradiated! So IMO I lost almost my whole summer (mid July, all of August and very beginning of Sept) to rads for nothing, even though my radiation oncologist disagreed with me on that. The radiation oncologist told me she thinks the skin mets would have been a LOT worse if I hadn't done the rads (and so does my Pack Rat, who is still acting like he thinks all this is going to keep me alive for several more years and that \"eventually\" I'll have more time where I can think and feel that life is worth living for the sake of LIFE rather than solely for the sake of HIM). I'm seeing my \"regular\" oncologist\" in a couple weeks and other than that I'm almost positive she'll tell me it's time for a PET scan and to start Faslodex, will see what she has to say about that. I dunno. In two and a half YEARS since my diagnosis, and through all the treatments, I have gained only a few WEEKS of time I physically and emotionally felt good and were worth living. The rest of it seems to me to have been \"time I bought\" with various treatments, time which was mostly not anywhere near worth the price I paid for it in terms of lousy QOL. Y'know, it really sucks to be right.",

I haven't discussed it with my new oncologist because by the time I got her, I was already over a year PFC and taking hormonals. As to the hormonal therapy, which I've been on since immediately after finishing chemo, OK, true, I've had complications -- deep vein thrombosis from Tamoxifen and severe side effects from AIs which I had to go on when I was taken off Tamox, but still I'd say they're only ALMOST as bad as chemo -- although the ONLY reason why I say this is because AIs don't cause hair loss or constant CRUSHING fatigue. So yeah, if I had been OFFERED A CHOICE between hormonal treatment and chemotherapy at the time I was diagnosed, I'd have picked the hormonal treatment. I feel like shit on AIs but at least I'm not bald anymore and usually have enough energy to do SOMETHING \"productive\"  in terms of keeping up with activities of daily living.",

I took the Kytril and Zofran as directed, the Compazine as needed, which was when my stomach would \"feel funny\" but was still short of full fledged nausea. (usually 2-3 a day but only for the first week).  Good luck! ",

So during our appointment my onc told me this including everything else we had to discuss, and she ordered a transfusion too. Yesterday I had two units of packed red blood cells. I do feel a little bit better today. I'm not bouncing with energy but also I'm not nearly as totally wiped out either. I think it's the benadryl which is why I'm still not up to speed -- they gave me benadryl and acetaminophen prior to the transfusion to prevent itching and swelling, and I've got enough past experience with benadryl to know that wipes me out (including mental \"hangover\") too.  The benadryl hangover is still less tired than the low hemoglobin tired, but I'm shocked to hear about the housecleaning! I hope I'm cleaning MY house in two more days! It sure needs it! LOL! ",

At first that kind of irked me but when I really thought of it -- and I am also a serious sissy when it comes to pain -- I was relieved I wouldn't have to deal with additional disability (even if only temporarily) on top of pain while recovering from a mastectomy. For instance, I can NOT wear button shirts, only pullovers, because my left hand is partially paralyzed from a stroke I had in 1993 so I don't have the fine motor coordination to manipulate buttons, and I can't afford to lose my right hand ability since my left is almost totally useless -- I would not be able to function at all without my right arm and hand -- and forget about being able to deal with the drains without two fully functional hands! Maybe I could have gotten/could still get a mastectomy if I made a \"great big noisy fuss\" to my new onc and insisted on it, but now I don't even want it. At the time I THOUGHT I was going to have a right breast mastectomy -- my first onc railroaded me into unwanted chemo saying I couldn't have a mastectomy without shrinking the tumor first, and back then I did want the cancer breast to be gone: so I did chemo reluctantly as the only condition under which they'd take off the cancer breast and AFTER chemo I ask \"so when's the surgery\" and THEN he tells me Stage IV's don't get it unless tumors are breaking out of the skin, which mine wasn't -- I had decided against reconstruction because, as already mentioned, I am a wimp and a sissy when it comes to pain. Almost everything I was reading in the reconstruction areas of this forum and looking at, at other sites, told me the results of recon on the mastectomy side and mammoplasty to make my left (non-cancerous) breast match the reconstructed one would most likely in the end LOOK really good (as good or better than my real breasts at their peak of health and beauty), but it would be really painful and \"sufficiently\" disabling for awhile to GET there, even WITHOUT the possible complications, and of course I would lose sexual sensitivity.  Um.

From what I can see at my weather sites, tomorrow and Saturday will be beautiful, but then back to the cloudy and rainy. Yes, it's depressing, and cancer DEFINITELY makes it worse!  I think some of the other women who posted before to suggest that some of your meds might be responsible for your emotional woes are likely to be on-target and I'd agree that it would be a good idea for you to consider discussing how crappy you feel with your doctor(s) or hospice caregivers as related to the medications you're taking. You wouldn't be the only one who has become depressed or otherwise emotionally unstable due to medication.  I've had medication totally screwing up my biochemistry and ending up almost suicidally depressed. I lost interest in things I had previously enjoyed for years, constantly cried on and off all day every day, and felt no sense of accomplishment when completing such tasks as I could do (this is to say I felt no pride in my clean house when I cleaned it, no pride in cooking a tasty meal my Pack Rat loved, no pride in being on top of my paperwork, etc.). I didn't have actual plans to kill myself, but most of my waking hours I had many active thoughts of how I'd be so much better off if I was dead. I'm off the Big Baddies which did that (AIs) and I'm much better in that I no longer cry all the time, have resumed doing, and again enjoying, activities I used to enjoy, and most of my sense of accomplishment came back. Initially I got back almost to full swing, feeling GOOD for the first time since before my diagnosis almost two and a half years ago, but now, I'm back down to the limits of my time and energy. So much for feeling good; I only got a few weeks to feel good until kidney failure and rads ruined my whole summer. Even so, I didn't go back to being the \"crybaby,\" actively wishing I was dead and am able to occasionally enjoy something, but that's probably because I'm still taking Wellbutrin and Ritalin to hold my emotions and what's left of my brain together, yes, thanks to the cognitive deficits I also ended up with. Cognitive deficits can be depressing in themselves -- especially if you had a sharp intellect, excellent memory and \"brainy\" or \"creative\" things were what you enjoyed most in life -- when you lose something that for you, was specifically that which made you feel that life was worth living, it's going to be damned depressing, and, I don't think THAT kind of depression is necessarily irrational, sad to say. So if you're going through that, I completely understand how you feel because that's what happened to me.  {{{{{LC}}}}} I wish I knew what else to say. I wish there was such a thing as a magic wand I could wave and make you -- and ALL of us -- whole again. :::::sigh:::: ",

I'm getting zapped (1) where my left breast used to be; (2) where my right breast used to be; (3) on the ribcage area below where my right breast used to be, as I'd had a little crop of skin mets removed from there while I was having the BMX, and (4) lower neck, to get the supraclavicular lymph nodes.  I'm supposed to get 28 \"regular\" treatments and then 5 boosts, for a grand total of 33. I've had 20/33 treatments to date (it's the weekend and I have 2 days off!). However, from what I've seen, it's usually Stage 0, 1, 2 and 3s who get this treatment, not Stage 4s. But, here's the story:  My original oncologist said mastectomy wasn't standard of care for Stage 4 patients (I was Stage 4 at the gate) unless or until tumor was breaking out of the skin of the breast, which wasn't happening at that time, and, I would only get rads if I had pain in the future which radiation would help (palliative radiation, he called it). He treated me with chemotherapy, Tamoxifen, and then AIs when I had to get off the Tamoxifen due to it causing a blood clot. I didn't meet NED but I did get to have affairs with both Reggie and the Stable Boy. When I moved (fall 2010) and went into a whole new treatment facility, the new doctors were a lot more aggressive. My new oncologist DID believe that mastectomy could prolong survival and improve QOL for Stage 4 patients, and, when the skin mets cropped up, both the oncologist and the breast surgeon (who also took off the skin mets) STRONGLY urged me to have radiation treatment because even though the surgeon believed she \"got it all\" regarding the breast tumors and \"probably\" got all the skin met stuff off too, the fact of the skin mets even being there was proof of cancer in the dermal lymphatics, meaning rads were medically necessary. So, I'm having rads. As for NED -- we still haven't been formally introduced but for the time being, right now is the closest I've gotten. Guess I'll see what happens when I'm scanned after I finish rads.",

GI Tract is fully back online. I'm back to just plain ole \"Morning Mouth\" (which goes away when I have my coffee/brush my teeth); no more constant Sewer Mouth, appetite is back and food is food again. Bread included (I couldn't eat bread at all for weeks because it felt like cardboard, it was totally revolting).   2. I only have to spend maybe 40-50% of the day lying on the couch (it was up to 75-80% at the \"height\" of it), and, when I AM up, it's better -- and when I get up, it doesn't feel like I ran around the block anymore.  It's still hard to walk UP the stairs, but I can do it, and take the garbage or laundry DOWN better now, and I no longer feel like I'm going to collapse or drop dead from going to get the mail or move the car (we have parking ordinances here: Mondays and Fridays at 4 PM I have to play \"musical cars\").  I can even go for what I call \"half a walk\" now. I can also carry my iBook around again too -- I took it with me Tuesday for my MUGA scan, and yesterday's bone and CT scans too. I originally it with me for all my doctor, test and scan appointments until my third chemo, but then I stopped except for the actual infusion days, because it was too tiring to carry it. Anyway, one more PFC scan to go (Tuesday morning PET scan), and yes my iBook will be coming with me.   3.  I sleep through the nights again, mostly anyway. Sometimes I wake up from hot flashes or to pee, but I go back to sleep: no more getting up at 3-4 AM wide awake and unable to get back to sleep. Still taking naps during the days at times though, but not as many.   4. I wasn't even looking for this because I was deliberately AVOIDING looking closely at my head, but couldn't help but notice it spontaneously a couple days ago (against a dark blue bath towel after a shower): I'm Fuzzie the Moldie! Um, Fuzzie the Moldie was what I named my \"pet\" Aspergillus niger mold before it sporulated back when I worked as a microbiologist at this one place, and when I saw what I saw on my head a couple days ago -- colorless-whitish fuzz on my head -- it immediately reminded me of mold mycelium! OK, I'm light years away from being able to open my apartment door without my wig on, but hair growth has to start sometime, somehow. I'm just shocked I noticed it this soon. I figured the color would have to come back or it would have to get to be an inch or two long before I'd notice it at all -- but okay, I noticed it anyway.   5. If I carefully divvy up what little brainpower I've got, I can actually get something done -- I can write a COUPLE of GOOD emails or a forum post for the day, OR I can spend some high quality time with my sims. Mostly I've chosen the sims and my email though...LOL...But I still have to make the choice, can't do both yet, and I have yet to regain my full former mental focus/eye for detail (so...sigh...can't go back to my Sims object hacking yet). I wish my brain was coming back faster, but I guess I should be glad I'm getting ANY of it back -- and that the morning coffee clears up SOME of the fog!   6. My libido is coming back, too. Definitely not as prolific as it was pre-chemo but more than I've had in months. Still not making the \"you won't be able to walk when I get through with you\" threat to my Pack Rat, but when he called last night I was definitely motivated to make some risque suggestions and \"I think I'm ready to try...\" (never mind the specific details) heh heh heh. He was very pleased to hear about this (LOL!)...and...he'll be here tonight.  >;-) So I'll see how much energy I actually have.   Okay, so I'm finally actually climbing out -- let's see what's doing with the rest of you...   Dawn:  I'm glad your surgery went well -- and how do you feel NOW? Um fainting, though? :-O I've never fainted before....dare I ask what it's like -- or is it like BC, and can't REALLY be understood by anyone who hasn't experienced it for themselves? Oh, and today's Friday -- you're coloring your hair today? So wow, you've got enough hair to color? That's great.  I wasn't coloring my hair prior to chemo (er, well, I used to be a bottled strawberry blonde a very long time ago, but stopped in my late 20s because I got sick of being a roots-slave, then decided I liked my natural color better!) -- so I don't plan on coloring it post-chemo either, unless it comes in all grey or something. My natural color was chestnut brown, and didn't see any grey at all until my early 40s -- by the time of my diagnosis at 47 (turned 48 in June) I still only had a very few scattered grey strands here and there (not enough IMO to justify going back to being a roots-slave: I'd need to be pushing salt-and-pepper to do that again). But right now all I have is the colorless \"mycelium.\" Even if I wanted to dye it, I don't think there's enough of it to dye. I wonder how long it'll take for me to notice any color at all to show up naturally (whether it's my former color or grey).  To answer your questions about Tamoxifen SE's -- the only real problem I've had so far that I KNOW I can point my finger at the Tamoxifen was that, OMG, horrors, my migraines came back!  :-O I had to go back on my old anti-migraine meds to get rid of them. That helped (no more migraines since going back on those meds). I have major power surges (hot flashes) too, but I was getting them from the chemo, and since both my oncologist and the chemo nurse told me it would take up to *6 months* for all chemo side effects to go away, and I'm only *1* month PFC, for all I know, my current hot flashes could still be from the chemo just as easily as the Tamoxifen, which also has hot flashes as a side effect. Out of curiosity, I'll still mention it to my oncologist at our next appointment (Sept 10th).   Linda: I hope your blood is OK, and OMG on the business about locking yourself out of your daughter's house bald and hatless! :-O If you and yours are able to laugh about that, more power to you. I'm afraid my sense of humor just isn't up to this kind of height! Personally, even though I don't even own a bathing suit (I don't have a good enough body to wear anything like that in public) -- if I had to choose between locking myself out bald/wigless but with my clothes on, or locking myself out longhaired but stark naked, I'd take longhaired but stark naked in a flat nanosecond. The only time my head is uncovered is when I'm inside my apartment. Not just in the building, but in my actual apartment.    Tammy: HAPPY BIRTHDAY.  :-D   Titan:  Guess I don't gotta say I could never do what you did riding in the car with your husband, but it's so hot and humid here (plus having all those hot flashes doesn't help) the first thing I do when I get back in my apartment, when I have to go out, is take off my wig, and yes, it feels good when I take it off. Nope, no wind blowing through my fuzz, but the air conditioner is fine.  Anyway even with the AC, it's too hot to wear my scarf even (after the initial cooling-off from wig removal, I get hot again -- and it's so gross, a sweating bald head! YUCK!). I used to wear my scarf in the apartment at all times except for (obvious) taking showers, but it got too hot/humid and even that felt too yucky sticking to my head, and it did, even when I wasn't actively having a hot flash. So the last couple of months I've \"had to\" go bareheaded in my apt full time, not just for my nightly shower. (I've always been an evening shower taker, so this is normal for me.)   :-O  OH NO about your other breast! That totally SUCKS!  :-*(  Oh, and while I love red wine, I still wouldn't consider myself as \"missing out\" on anything if it turns out I don't have to do rads...I can still drink red wine ANYWAY, right? LOL.    Amy -- that's WONDERFUL that you're feeling so energetic only two weeks PFC! Although I'm feeling a LOT better now than I had been, even now, four weeks out, I'm still not actually energetic or even feeling fully like myself again. Well, that's great for you being so resilient. :-)   ljh and stephanie -- Congrats on finishing, and how do you feel? I know you only just finished, but I hope you crawl out fast like Amy and not slow like me!   Pam  -- How are you feeling? Hope the SEs from the taxol and herceptin are at least tolerable. And yeah, I just BET you can't wait to be done already! Enjoy your trip to Maine. I canceled my annual summer week in New Hampshire (my Pack Rat's \"nest in the north\") this year because of the chemo. I couldn't figure out how to schedule a week away when I was feeling like complete crap for 2 weeks of every 3, and had to be here for all the treatments and doctor appointments, plus I couldn't deal with the idea of the 6-8 hour drive up there with the chemo brain either.    Betsy, Titan, Laura -- good luck with the rads. I hope they're not as bad as chemo! (Um yeah, I know, what could be as bad as chemo?!)    Also, Betsy, sorry to hear you have the mouth pain/eating issues. :-(   Chelev -- congrats on the ACS win.   If I missed anybody, I'm sorry -- and hope you're feeling as good as you possibly can. I'll try to come back sooner so maybe it won't take three hours to catch up with you all and catch you up on me.   ~Lena.      ",

Not only could I not pull off short hair, I used to look icky when I put my long hair up in a ponytail (which I had to do at times) -- even when I was young and as close to beautiful as I ever was.   Yeah, I'm on the geeky side, but my computer literacy doesn't extend to graphics design or web stuff. I'm artistically retarded (I have no sense of spatial proportion or direction: this part of my brain seems to never have been wired up in the first place, so I'm not blaming it on chemo), and could never trouble myself to learn HTML either.

I was \"at it\" for most of yesterday, but not able to accomplish my goal with the new Firewire drive. I got so mad I unhooked it and put it back in its box because I couldn't even stand to LOOK at it anymore! Oh, and you're also not the only one dealing with hot flashes (YUCK!!). I started having them while doing my chemo, and I'm still having them -- not sure if still from the chemo since I was told chemo SE's could take up to 6 months to fully subside, or if now it's from the Tamoxifen, which also has hot flashes as a SE. Either way, I know what you mean when you say you feel like you smell -- feeling hot/sweaty with your clothes sticking to you is bound to generate that impression. Gotta say I'm sick of feeling like that when I shower every day. I tell myself, especially since I frequently get a hot flash five minutes after my shower -- as soon as I sit down at the computer to do something afterwards (GRRR!) -- that I just took a freakin' shower so there's no way I can actually BE stinky yet! But still it's sooo yucky. I don't miss having periods, though, and I hope mine never ever EVER come back! I always hated that since not only did I always find them awful (even when they got less painful in my 30s, I can't say I ever learned to enjoy bleeding 4-5 days every month!), but since I never wanted to have kids, so utterly useless on top of it all. That's why I think of my uterus as the one part of my body I never had any use for!  Right before beginning my chemo, my chemo nurse told me that going on chemo would not only stop my periods through treatment but also most likely push me into permanent menopause besides, given my age, I told her,\"Well, so ONE good thing MIGHT come of this! No more periods, YAY!\"  Ehhhh, but here I go now, still \"dying\" of these darn cramps I've been getting for pushing a week now (ticks me off since I'd finally gotten over the cold and was starting to feel good again). But, at least I'm not bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound is this afternoon, maybe I'll find out what's going on -- if it could be the suspected fibroid(s) which turned up on my CT scan.   Dawn -- Your husband will probably laugh at me (Titan, you may wish to skip this section, since it'll definitely give you a headache). Yes, Dawn, you can tell your husband I'm most emphatically a Mac woman (ever since 1986 when I met a Mac Plus running System 6), but I choose to run the older PPC Macs. In addition to budgetary reasons which preclude my ability to shell out a couple grand to buy a brand new Mac, I still require the use of older applications and machines/versions of the Mac OS which will run Classic Mode. This means the \"highest\" I can possibly go would be a G5 running OS X Tiger 10.4.11. Current \"state of the art\" with Macs are Mac Pros, MacBooks, MacBook Pros (plus various other Macintels) and the Snow Leopard operating system just released (10.6.x).  Since none of those support Classic Mode, I couldn't use any of them if someone gave them to me for free! So here's what I'm running:   G4 Quicksilver 867 just brought up to 10.4.11 as of yesterday. This is my main machine, coming to you from it now. Has OS 9.2.2 for Classic Mode.   G3/800 iBook running 10.4.9, also with OS 9.2.2 for Classic Mode. No need to upgrade this one, even though it's the \"companion laptop\" for my Quicksilver.   Planning to add to the mix in the near future: a G4 Mini 1.5 GHz, OS X Tiger 10.4.2/9.2.2 -- what a beautiful little Mac, and what a deal, too! I got it off the Low End Mac Swap List for $115 shipped. Yeah, I know, way \"downgraded\" in the OS department, but that was yet another attraction, for me at least! Although this is my most powerful machine in terms of the CPU, I plan to turn it into a pure Simming machine, since I have problems with the higher OS and my Sims game on the Quicksilver -- the kind of problems that started when Apple upgraded the Tiger OS from 10.4.2 to 10.4.3. Hence I'm elated to get a machine with 10.4.2!   Also have a few other older Macs: a G3/450 B&W, G3/400 Lombard Powerbook, and a couple real oldies; a Powerbook 5300c and a Powerbook 190 (this is a legacy Mac, a 68K, with OS 7.5.5 on it!). These all still run except for the Lombard, which mysteriously died last year (but I can't dispose of it: sentimental reasons: my Pack Rat gave it to me).   Chelev -- Yeah, you look way too young to have been in menopause since 1997! Um, do the hot flashes EVER go away?   Gotta go for now. Hope you're feeling OK and catch you next time.   (Oh, and why is this stupid board posting my posts in grey italics of late?)    ~Lena.      ",

Glad you survived the trip and made it home safe and sound, and that you got to enjoy some time with your sister.   Titan -- LOL, not embracing the \"playboy bunny\" look is not synonymous with prudehood. Given enough energy, I'm emphatically wild (with my Pack Rat) and proud of it. It's just that my wildness doesn't include trying to look or act like a playboy bunny. (Maybe because I don't consider it sexy to make a total ass of myself! LOL) -- I just don't like the 6-year-old girl business downstairs is all, even though the only ones who'll ever see it are me and my Pack Rat...and oh yeah, I almost forgot. Medical personnel....Like the med tech who performed my pelvic ultrasounds (oh, have you or anyone else in here had those? I'll tell the story momentarily, it was too funny!)...I was kind of embarrassed when I showed up for that, and was so relieved the tech was a woman. I never cared before, I never got embarrassed about showing any part of my body to a doctor, nurse or med tech, regardless of their gender, prior to this being bald downstairs thing. That was really weird.   Oh, and there won't  pictures of my moldy head taken, ever. I never liked having my picture taken when I liked how I looked, and since my pre-chemo short haircut I've refused to even open my apt door without a wig on -- so there is no chance in hell I'd let anyone near me with a camera with this mold head of mine!   Woo-hoo, OK, and speaking of the pelvic ultrasound, etc., it's confirmed. I've got several \"medium sized\" fibroids in my uterus. My onc returned my call today and said that was the result of the pelvic ultrasounds. Nothing to worry about, he says, just good to know and something to keep an eye on. He didn't know if those bad cramps with no period were related to the fibroids or the Tamoxifen, though.   And now for the funny story of my pelvic ultrasounds. I had two types -- trans-abdominal and trans-vaginal. For the trans-abdominal, your bladder has to be full -- VERY full, so I was told to drink a lot of water between 1-2 hours before the procedure. Since my appointment was for 2:30, I started drinking a lot of water at 12:30 or so. By 1 PM I had to go \"pretty bad,\" but held it not knowing exactly how full my bladder had to be. I kept drinking more water, and by 1:30 was fit to bust! I decided to stop drinking water at that point, but  I was sure I was going to burst and ride in on a tsunami into the hospital's Women's Imaging Center. I couldn' t sit still in the waiting room seat, I was squirming like crazy. Finally, one of the women at the reception desk came up to me with a cup, handed me the cup and said she saw I was going to burst, and says \"You can fill his cup about half way, there'll still be enough for the test, and directed me to the bathroom. Ahhhh, SOME relief! Well it happens that I'd filled my bladder just perfect for the test, and it went mostly well, except when the insruments came into occasional contact with my bladder, which made it a major chllenge not to pee all over the examining table! When this part of he testing was over, I was  told to go fully empty my bladder  in preparation for the trans-vaginal ultrasound. Lemme tell you ladies -- no pee EVER felt THAT good!   So my bladder is empty, I lie back down on the table and the technician shows me the instrument to be used for the trans-vaginal ultrsound --it looks like a....well, a dildo! So I started calling it the dildo-cam, and, it even wore a condom! and kind of felt like a (narrowly endowed) male in there! Funnier when she asked ME to insert it! ROFL!   Soon as I got home from that, I called my Pack Rat and said to him, he has to develop some kind of computerized/electronic interface to work on his \"parts,\" so that if I ever need a transvaginal ultrasound again, HE can be the \"dildo cam.\"   Well, WE thought it was funny as hell anyway. :-D",

We'll see how it goes. Also, he gave the okay for me to take black cohosh for the hot flashes (though he says he doubts it'll work -- my friend Kym had suggested it, and she came with me for the appointment this time). So for now, I'm off Femara and on black cohosh (oh, and I'm still on the Coumadin for the clot: my platelets are coming up but still low). It's only been a few days, not enough time for significant improvement, but I think at least the mood swings are starting to ease up slightly -- I'm down from 3-4 cry fests per day to only 1 or 2, and I think maybe the walking is improving too. I still have the joint aching (no change) but a LITTLE more energy to do a little more walking, and not dying for a nap and back to spending half the day on the couch like I was. If I had the mental focus I could do longer posts, but I don't, sorry. It's like the chemo brain made a bit of a comeback. :-P Quickies before I go (sorry I don't have the  energy to get to absolutely everybody: thank you ALL for your support though, and may you all be happy and as healthy as you possibly can be!) --  Chelev: 1. Yeah I'm off the Femara for now but, if I want to live, I'll probably have to go back on it or something else similar. The difference between you (Stage 2) and me (Stage 4) here is this:  if YOU don't take Femara, MAYBE you'll have a recurrence, but maybe NOT and you'll be OK. If *I* don't take it, I DIE. Now I may in fact decide that death is preferable to life on Femara (I couldn't take birth control pills when i was younger: messing with my hormones was always bad news even when I was young and healthy), but that remains to be seen. 2. OUCH on the layoff thing, I know how it feels to be where you are because the economy ate my job in May 2008, and a few months later while still unsuccessfully looking for work, my right breast started to change: unemployed, no med insurance (couldn't afford cobra). And even when I was healthy, I always had problems with \"selling myself.\" I was never the outgoing cheery type, and I always strongly resented having to act like something I wasn't.

Not fair! OK, to be serious, judging from that pic, on top we're about equal, but you have more hair on the sides than I do. On the subject of hair, soon as I catch up my reading over there, I'll be posting to the Hair Hair Hair thread the nightmare that woke me up this morning. I dreamed I discovered I was out topless and so embarrassed I wanted to die! Whatever happened to those good old fashioned stark naked in public nightmares? :-O Oh, and finally, I suppose now that I have the majority of my computer issues under control, I finally did some calculations (i.e., what I'm paying for my dialup ISP and telephone bill) and got myself steeled up to call Verizon today. I ordered a high speed internet/voice communications package (my phone service will be the same but I'll have high speed internet WITH it, and I'll be able to be online and on the phone at the same time!). Believe it or not, this combo package which will be the exact same phone service but superior Internet, is going to cost a bit LESS than my separate dialup ISP and phone service I've had for ages now. So sometime this week or early next when the DSL modem gets here, I'll be done with dialup. I look forward to that, but talk about stressful -- it took a freakin' HOUR to place the order because I had to answer all the Verizon salesperson's stupid questions and then before they can give you a confirmation number on your order, they have to read you this light years long legal crap nonsense which they say will be coming in writing, with your modem and instruction kit, and into which they throw advertising at you. UGGGH What a freakin' PITA!  Like why do they need anything other than my phone number/billing information, my computer specs to confirm I can use their service and the services I want to order? It should take 5-10 mins, not an hour or more! OK, yes, this would have pissed me off before I had cancer too. Wow, it's time to take my meds already...OK, see you all next time. Take care of yourselves! ~Lena. ",

Sorry Chelev! :-( Okay, my oncologist has not actually CALLED me a hypochondriac, not even once, it's just a feeling I have that he doesn't entirely take me seriously, because of the fact that I go online and do research about my illness and the drugs I'm being given to combat it, and try to discuss those things with him at our appointments (which *I* feel is what you gals, and I, and my Pack Rat would call a \"doctor-patient team\" approach in dealing with a serious disease (and is the kind of relationship I think is GOOD to have with one's doctor). The last time I had asked Kym to come with me, to see if this opinion is \"just me being hysterical\" (especially while I was under the horrible influence of the Femara), or if there's any basis in objective reality. She told me that while SHE knows I'm not a hypochondriac, she can understand why the DOCTOR might see me as one because I should \"let him be a doctor\" and not talk so much in detail about my symptoms and side effects. Uh, OK, maybe, but I woulda thunk a doctor NEEDED detailed information! I wish my Pack Rat could also come with me to an appointment (especially since he thinks it's wonderful that I'm a biology geek, that this should make me a good patient who is able to have intelligent conversations with a doctor), but that would be even harder to arrange than being able to get Kym to come. Oh well. Anyway.... The good news: I had my two weeks off the Femara, and it took all of five days for me to stop being tired and depressed and crying and wishing I was dead all the time, and, as I had an appointment with my oncologist yesterday,he said I don't have to take it anymore. The bad news is that my joints still ache and the pain med for that is only occasionally effective. Also, as I suspected, he wants me to take ANOTHER aromatase inhibitor, and he gave me a prescription for Aromasin. I wanted to say, \"What about 'taking anything that messes with my hormones totally f*cks me up' don't you understand?\" (I couldn't take birth control pills when I was younger either) -- but okay, I thought, \"let him be the doctor,\" and \"maybe this one won't be as bad as the Femara\" (in that tone of sarcastic mental thought where I have to 'try' to convince myself of something). Plus, there's also that nasty little fact I'm sure I mentioned previously, that for me, hormonal treatments aren't about preventing recurrence, they're about postponing IMMINENT DEATH (and regardless of whether he thinks I'm a hypochondriac or not, for my kind of cancer, this IS the standard course of action, so it's not like he's a quack who doesn't know jack shit about Stage IV breast cancer). So, we'll see what happens. I did, however, ask him if I can wait until Monday to start taking the Aromasin, telling him that since my Pack Rat is going to be here for this weekend, I want to be happy and not all messed up. He laughed and said yes, it's OK to start it on Monday. Moving right along -- my platelets are up a bit but the INR number was down (he didn't tell me that number was down but I noticed it on the printout, being a biology geek), so he adjusted my Coumadin dosage too. These instructions I followed right away, but I had to write 'em down because this is just NOT something you expect anyone who did chemo to be able to remember: On even days (like yesterday, the 20th) I'm supposed to take a 5 mg Coumadin tablet. On odd days (like today, the 21st), I'm supposed to take a 2.5 mg Coumadin tablet. Okay, I'm on track with that, I took my 5 mg Coumadin pill yesterday on schedule, got a 2.5 for tonight, and, just picked up all my prescriptions at the pharmacy today so all's cool here. My next oncologist appointment is June 3rd.  Oh, and Scan Time is coming up again too -- my periodic CT, PET and Bone scans are scheduled for June 14th and 15th. Good, I don't have any medical visits on my birthday at least, and maybe when my Pack Rat is here, we can start planning my annual summer week visit to his Nest in the North -- the one I couldn't do at all last summer because of the chemotherapy. Or maybe this year I'll be able to go up twice, who knows. Well all this presumes I don't wear him out to an early grave this weekend I guess. Heh heh heh. But he says he wants me back on the picnic table, I say he has to give me a whole body massage with the insect repellent cream, and now we get to why, besides Simming, I haven't posted in the last couple weeks even though I was feeling better since a few days after I stopped taking the Femara.... I've been trying to do something about my disgusting fat body! My Pack Rat has repeatedly told me I'm exaggerating when I complain about being a fat slob with all this weight gain, but I'm the one who has to see the big fat horse whose clothes don't fit right in the mirror every day! Holy Ratness,what happened to the idea that cancer patients LOSE weight, and why couldn't THAT have been me? There are no words I can think of to adequately describe exactly how much I HATE my body the way it is now. It's GROSS!  I have NEVER in my ENTIRE LIFE been THIS frickin heavy! My heaviest past weight was 145 pounds, then just by cutting out all the pasta I'd been eating back then, I got back down to an acceptable 125-130 pounds (I was in my 20s then). My over-40 weight of 135, well I didn't love it but could tolerate it usually. I have a small frame, so it SHOWS, I put it all on in my Midsection from Hell. I weigh 157 now and I hardly eat pasta anymore at all. Oh and yeah, I also stopped pigging out on all those corn muffins, and, once the weather warmed up I started going for walks, figuring at least SOME exercise was better than sitting on my fat ass all day, but only in the last couple weeks have I seen even the slightest difference -- and I have to walk at least 2 miles a day (it's only once I had worked UP to 2 miles a day did my weight start to go down, but I only lost 3 pounds -- last time at the doctor I weighed 160 instead of yesterday's 157 -- I lost 3 pounds in 2 weeks...well, better than nothing I guess. But I had to buy Really Fat Clothes. I call them REALLY FAT clothes because the last time I went clothes shopping, to accept weighing 135 pounds, to me that was buying plain old Fat Clothes, so the ones I just got last weekend are the REALLY fat clothes. So I've been going for walks every day that it doesn't rain. In the past month, I only skipped out on two days -- it was windy, chilly and raining on those two days. Other than them, I've gone out and walked every single day. I started with around the block, worked up to a 2-block, then 3-block circle, and finally to a full circle of the lake in the park next door (which I'm told is a mile), then two full circles of that lake. Today I really overdid it though: I walked almost FOUR miles, and I was carrying Heavy Stuff for half of it! :-O See, cause my Pack Rat's coming, I needed to go to the supermarket today anyway to get the Pack Rat Spoilage Stuff (special dinner ingredients for tomorrow night, I'm making Italian food: green, red, yellow and orange peppers with onions, potatoes and sweet Italian sausages sauteed in olive oil...plus onion bagels for breakfast and the tuna salad, fruit for snacks and salad greens)...the supermarket is almost 2 miles from my apartment, and what do I decide to do? WALK there, buy food, and while carrying it back stop in the pharmacy on the way home to pick up my Coumadin and Aromasin! Yes, I did it, but by the time I got home, I really wanted to drop dead! -- I was exhausted, sweating and itching, and having hot flashes too! Today is Lena-Is-An-Idiot-Day for sure, because not too long after catching my breath from all that, I did the laundry!! Two frickin loads (a full basket) up and down those four flights of stairs. Oh and yeah the goddamn dryer is busted again. The slumlords had fixed 'em, but then one broke again. They fixed it, but two days later it's busted, and now it's been a whole week. I told the super twice early in the week and it's still busted, so I had to do the dryer loads one at a time. I hope I have the ENERGY to wear out my Pack Rat when he gets here (ETA midnight). Have a good weekend all...don't do anything I wouldn't... ;-)  ~Lena. ",

Start date on that will be in the next couple days -- when this horrid heat and humidity GET GONE, as Unisys Weather says it will. So, hmmmm, that's 16 more packed and ready boxes since I got home from my Pack Rat's nest...plus a couple others I started but haven't numbered or sealed up yet cause I'm still using some of the stuff that needs to go in there. I am so ready to pass out now, though..... Alaina -- are you around? How are you feeling> Betsy -- Good to hear your home remodeling is going well. Not so good to hear about the swollen boob. :-( Geri -- Excellent on your deportation (hehehe). It didn't take me long to recover from getting mine put in, so I don't expect healing after it's removed would be THAT bad....(gosh, do ya think if I tell them what planet I'm REALLY from, they'll deport me as an illegal ailen? ;-)) Helen, how's the hip feeling. I don't wanna scare you so I won't mention anything specific about when I was having hip pain. Hopefully Geri's right and you'll find out yours is \"just\" arthritis and/or bursitis too. About those women looking to you for support -- dunno how well I could do anything like that...I'd probably get overwhelmed and maybe depressed again! Titan -- I'd sure love to drop several dress sizes like that in a couple months! LOL. Yup, I'm still losing weight (12 pounds down now, 18 to go), but I do wish it was happening a little faster is all. Yesterday I tried on a pair of last year's jeans which I had gained too much weight to wear this year. They ALMOST fit me! I can get INTO them, but not zip/button 'em up yet. Maybe in a few more weeks I can wear 'em again. Judy -- did the doctor tell you what med she wanted to give you for osteoporosis? Just curious.... OK sisters, have fun and feel GOOD!  :-)  ~Lena. ",

I went out for 2 walks today so far. \"Only\" packed two boxes today (though I did wash the kitchen stuff I found, did the laundry and Purged the top kitchen cabinets that I had to stand on a chair to get at...but the day isn't over yet.....I'm kinda trying to resist the urge to go play sims in the park......or TRY to anyway. Gorgeous weekends like this are usually too crowded and it's hard to find a picnic table to sit at. Ironic discovery: since I decided to go back to wearing contact lenses, I dug up some of the old ones I had left (my distance prescription hasn't significantly changed) and put them on. OMG. Since I see so much better with contact lenses than glasses, it made me wonder why I went back to glasses last time I had my eyes examined (2008)...till I looked in the mirror and saw the bags under my eyes. :-{ Well here's the paradox about all this... I've been blind as a bat since first grade. I wore glasses through my childhood and into being a teenager, but when I was 16, my mother, who had been so unsuccessful in trying to get me into \"girlie\" things like makeup and clothes she was worrying about me, suggested contact lenses, telling me how pretty I'd look with them. At first I refused saying no way would I be sticking things in my eyes, thank you. Then my father got into the act and told me about the new \"soft\" contact lenses (gosh now you know I'm an olde pharte!) which wouldn't hurt. Reluctantly I tried them...and found out that not only did I see fifty times better (wow, PERIPHERAL VISION!!) but yes, I DID look a thousand percent prettier (but no, that didn't spur me into getting interested in makeup or clothes, much to my mother's dismay). So.... from the time I was 16 until my late 20s/early 30s (at which point I started working in labs and contacts weren't allowed for safety reasons and HAD to go back to glasses), I always wore contacts. In my early 40s when I ended my lab career, I wanted to go back to contacts but the extended wear lenses they'd had briefly in the 80s (which I LOVED) were no longer available, and by this time, my left hand was out of commission from the stroke so I stuck with glasses because it was too hard to put on contacts every single day especially in the morning...finally in 2007 extended wear lenses came back, and I got 'em (you only have to change them once a week, and I chose to do it on Friday evenings). But as soon as I got 'em I looked in the mirror expecting to see my pretty face and what do I see? The saggy bags under my eyes, which glasses had pretty much hidden all those years. So in 2008 when it was time for the yearly eye exam, I went back to glasses. When I was in NH with my Pack Rat a couple weeks ago and was having some minor issues seeing while I drove (no accidents, but enough for concern) we talked about it and I said yes I was planning to see the eye doctor before moving (nope, I didn't go to the eye doctor last year). He said since my vision was so much better with contacts, I should get those, so I'm getting them....ironic because it used to be contacts made me look good, but now they don't -- and since they really DO help my vision much more, I get to see precisely how icky I look. Oh well.... But...now when I get hot flashes or look down, my damn glasses won't fall off my face anymore. That was really pissing me off. I'll try to think of how much EASIER it'll be, in addition to being able to see better, whenever I get down on the baggy eyes. ~Lena ",

I've been under general anesthetics on a few rare occasions, but never feeling panicked or anxious. The \"worst\" such awakening was feeling nauseous (that was when I got spayed). Other than that I felt peaceful and woozy. How are you feeling now? Is your recovery still progressing at this seemingly rapid rate (I hope)? Titan and Judy, my fellow blind-as-a-bat sisters... yesterday I got my new contacts. Now I knew I had an \"industrial strength\" prescription -- when I hit 8.5 diopters about 20-25 years ago, the optician's eyes bugged out at the sight of the prescription...but my new prescription as of yesterday has MY eyes bugging out! I'm up to 10.5 diopters! :-O But, OK, if that's what it takes, that's what it takes. The new contacts are wonderful until I sit down at the computer or try to read or write something down (or even look for a small object I misplaced) -- when I do THAT I am immediately reduced to wincing in pain and squinting and grabbing for the +2 drugstore reading glasses I can no longer function without (and ratness help me when I misplace THOSE!).  Oh well........ now WHY didn't I let myself die of cancer?! Getting old SUCKS and I could have prevented it! Helen -- that really SUCKS about your hair.  :-(  Oh, and I wouldn't call me \"happy\"  just yet. I mean yes, I do feel BETTER than I did before starting the Wellbutrin, but I haven't REALLY been \"happy.\" But maybe, we'll see. Yesterday I had my psychiatrist appointment and this time I remembered to tell him about still feeling \"off\" and how it felt like the creative part of me was dead forever despite the other improvements. While we were talking about it, he said something and I reacted by bursting into tears. Although I \"came out of it\" quickly, he said I still did have some depression, and he upped my dosage of the Wellbutrin. So, we'll see what happens. Since you said you were feeling better but not really all that great since you started, what dosage are you on? My first week was 150 mg/day, then he upped it to 300 mg/day, which was what I was taking until yesterday, when he increased it to 450 mg/day. I started the increase when I got home. I had to dig the 150 mg pill bottle out of a box I'd packed so I could take one, but OK, and, I'll fill the prescription before I move -- the pills I excavated are actually enough for awhile, at least until time to refill the 300s. I take the whole dose in the morning. Oh. How was your onc appointment and how is your friend who had the mastectomy? DAWN!!! You look like a human! ROFLMAO! :-D That sounds like some vacation you had. Glad you all enjoyed it. Oh, and about your recent cancer anxieties: MY motto is \"no news is good news.\" If you're getting regular blood tests and your oncologist hasn't been saying anything's wrong with you, don't sweat it. Same goes for scans if you get them. I know, I'm weird, seeing how so many patients get so worked up while waiting for test results, but I just feel: there is nothing I can do about it and I don't even know if anything really is wrong. And for so long as I don't know, or the oncologist hasn't said anything about \"bad findings\" in my blood work or scans, that's time I can spend NOT faced with some kind of horrendous decision to make about treatment or worse, GETTING some kind of horrendous treatment with more horrible side effects and so on. I'm to the point where, I just don't even WANT to know anymore. I go to the doctor, let them take blood, let them scan me, listen to what the doctor says, and the only questions I ask (well OK, I stopped asking when he told me there was nothing he could do and he didn't know what caused them) are about side effects I'm actually HAVING (of late, the ones from the damned Aromasin). Geri -- nope, I haven't had time to play sims in the park. Some days I haven't had time to go for my WALKS in the park, or to play sims at all. I did finally play my sims a little last night. I'm in the close-countdown part of the move and about to lose my  mind completely. Like a couple days ago my Pack Rat was telling me on the phone that on his next trip with the pickup truck (tonight) he wants to start taking the \"smaller\" (non-bed, non-dresser) furniture if possible, which includes the computer desk, the \"big\" table in the living room, and says everything I still need to use which isn't clothes in the dresser should fit on the coffee table, which means I'm going to have to shut down the computer network (and big 21\" flatscreen monitor) TODAY so all I have left is the iBook (and external HD) on the coffee table! So that's why I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. I HAVE TO be here physically through Friday the 24th (last onc appointment is 9/22, then I need to refill prescriptions and close out my bank account). I wasn't expecting to have to pack down the network for about another week to week and a half! Yeah I can still \"live\" on the iBook but it's much easier physically to sit at the desk or a desklike thing, not to mention typing on a full size keyboard (iBook's keyboard is \"too small\" and \"too light)...oh well..yup I believe I CAN have all this done today, or should I say be READY -- I can update the backups, shut down the computers, discombobulate the network wiring and pack up the wires, KVM, printer ethernet adapter and router, but my Pack Rat's going to have to move the heavy Quicksilver tower off the desk and the heavy laser printer off the top of the file cabinet. Amy my dear, *I* am sorry I did chemo, remember? I made the mistake of CONSIDERING it when my Pack Rat encouraged me to have my BC treated, and after that was I feel as though I was plain and simple manipulated into it. My oncologist never fucking bothered to tell me that mastectomy wasn't standard of treatment for Stage IV patients. He HAD told me my breast tumor was \"too big to be operable unless I had chemotherapy to shrink it\" and that I was a Stage IV patient due to my bone met (and mediastinal mets at the time), and it was under THOSE terms I allowed myself to be talked into chemo. After I was fucking wrecked and destroyed from chemo and asking when I'd be having my mastectomy, THAT was when I found out that the only time mastectomies are \"standard treatment\" for Stage IV patients is when their tumors are breaking out of the skin, leaking and making painful messes. I actually had to ask him at two subsequent appointments after finishing chemo for it to sink in -- combination of shock and chemo brain. Now forgive me if I'M \"touchy,\" but this pisses me the fuck off like you wouldn't believe!!! THIS is how it SHOULD have gone (at the time I was scheduled for but hadn't yet started chemo): Doctor: We found metastases in your mediastinal lymph nodes and left iliac bone, which means your cancer is Stage IV. Mastectomies are not standard of care for Stage IV patients. Me: So this means I won't be having a mastectomy, even if I have the chemotherapy and it shrinks my tumor to operable size? Doctor: That's right, unless your tumor breaks out from the skin. If that happens, I'll order a mastectomy for you.  Me: Okay, thanks. Then I'm not going to have chemotherapy. If you can, please let me know approximately how long I have left to live, what I can expect, and what the palliative options are.  [and we'd have gone on from THIS point.]  But that is NOT how it happened. He didn't fucking BOTHER to tell me until I'd already DONE the fucking chemo!  >:-P GRRRRRRRRRR! and I am RUINED for whatever is left of the rest of my life!   :-*( Now, I did read your \"problem post\" and while I obviously don't agree with all of it, I don't find it offensive (IMO you expressed your opinion both eloquently and tactfully), and, while I would have cancelled my appointment to start chemo if I had been TOLD prior to the start date I wasn't going to be operated on, neither do I agree with those \"natural girls\" either. And yes, call my original motive to not do chemo fear, I don't care. Yes, I'm a sissy, and i am not ashamed to admit it. I was AFRAID OF THE SIDE EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY SINCE SO MANY ARE LONG TERM AND/OR PERMANENT. I consider having had chemo TIED FOR FIRST PLACE as the MOST HORRENDOUSLY STUPID THING I EVER DID IN MY LIFE. (tied for #1 with getting married) Someday when I get the time I'm going to start a thread in which I scream how much I HATE that we (BC patients) are called \"warriors\" who are \"bravely fighting a battle\" against our disease. Well I ain't no fucking warrior and I am NOT brave!!!!!!!!! I'll probably be lambasted and chased off the forum but so be it. Glad you enjoyed the beach, though....oh, and happy Jewish New Year (you too Helen; I think I recall you're Jewish too, right?) OK I know I have to have missed some people and some subjects...sorry...but it's almost 9:30 and if I'm going to get everything I'm supposed to do today, done, I need to get started now. Enjoy your weekend and I hope you all feel good!  ~Lena.  ",

      "Content": "Dec 17, 2010 09:58AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:25AM by Lena Well, Judy ...no choice like that for me: I'm going to have to go to a salon, if I can find one up here which does that AND if have money to spend on such a thing once I find one. I only had one friend in NJ (well two if you count her husband) and she LIKED her hair short and wavy/curly anyway. Up here I only have my Pack Rat, who HAS long straight hair ( :::::sigh:::: he's so beautiful! I actually feel embarrrassed for him having to be seen with me now when we go out) and doesn't need or know about ANY hair stylists, expensive or otherwise.   Amy, I forgot something I wanted to comment on -- the phone call with your mother where you told her you knew you didn't get your cancer from overexposure to cleaning products -- ME NEITHER!!  ROFLMAO!   But maybe now I can get a NEW cancer from that, though....which is kind of another part of how I bit off more than I could chew with this house. A bigger home means there's more to clean. It's pretty exhausting, even though the ONLY housework I do more than once a week is taking out the garbage and washing dishes (plus counters/stove/microwave as needed). Floor sweeping and carpet vacuuming I only do once a week; bathroom appliances every OTHER week, and mopping bathroom and kitchen floors once a month. And all that is not only more space to clean here, but in the old apartment, dishes, trash and laundry were the ONLY cleaning chores I did regularly (after a few years of personal grossout contests anyway): bathroom appliances only if I was expecting company;  floors and anything else only once or twice a year), so by comparison, even though I still don't THINK I spend MANIAC amounts of time cleaning here (including occasional days I skip doing dishes), it's true that I do more cleaning here than I did in the old apartment.   I don't know how to explain this: youth maybe? When I originally moved into my old apartment (age 24), yes it was given to me spic and span clean, but I couldn't be bothered to KEEP it that way. I was lucky I didn't end up with cockroaches in fact, I was such a slob. I just didn't care in the slightest. By the time I would even NOTICE it was getting messy and dirty, I was looking at a whole weekend spent doing nothing but cleaning, and most of the time I'd just let it go for a few more weeks or even months because I wasn't willing to give up two days to take care of it. And then it came to the point where, with my sick sense of humor, I thought it was FUNNY to be such a slob and regale coworkers, classmates and others with all the gross stories I could wring out of it, and there were lots...the Orange Mold story being the funniest IMO. My listeners would be making faces, grimacing and shrieking \"Ewwwwwww!\" and I got such a charge out of it. I even STILL have an Internet buddy who asked me how many Brillos was the bathtub when I moved out (I had an actual formal rating system to describe how dirty my bathtub was, i.e., how many Brillos it would take to clean it!).   So on the average, every five years I would do a Grand Purge (get rid of stuff I didn't use, clean the whole apartment as best I could)...Once, for awhile, I decided even though I didn't like TO clean, I did like CLEAN, and thought maybe if I'd clean up after myself right away, maybe it wouldn't get so bad I'd have to be spending all my spare time for several days cleaning. The longest attempt at \"reform\" lasted for about 10 months, then I was back to my old slobby self . \"Hello. My name is Lena, and I'm a Slobaholic.\"  (hey, I'd be able to teach Oscar Madison how to be a slob -- he was NOTHING compared to me!).   After I had my stroke, though, I was not physically able to clean as thoroughly as I had in past Purges, and the Purge-to-Purge interval got longer and longer, and so I was almost totally back to the Old Ways (only getting progressively more too old and tired to have those little grossout contests with myself, purposely seeing how long I could go without doing a certain cleaning thing, and getting off on it). Sometimes I'd look around and think how I wanted the place to be cleaner but knew I didn\u2019t have the physical horsepower anymore. Time went by, the place deteriorated even more...a few years went by, and finally I was beginning to approach the financial ability to hire someone to clean it and maybe have someone come in once every other month to do the heavy stuff. I had made a mental note to look into it, a couple days go by -- yes DAYS, ISYN -- and I get laid off from my job.   So much for that idea. And then I got breast cancer. Obviously, no WAY did I get it from cleaning fluids!   Well anyway with this place I decided not to let it GET bad in the first place. So I don\u2019t need the kind of overdrive/physical horsepower/elbow grease I would in the old place, but the new place is at least 3x bigger than the old one was, so there\u2019s more to clean and it\u2019s pretty tiring to do it anyway. But since I\u2019m succeeding with the upkeep so far, I think that may also explain some of my feelings of displacement living here: This CAN\u2019T be MY house, because it\u2019s WAY TOO EFFIN\u2019 CLEAN!!! ROFLMAO!   Well laundry's almost done (using laundromat's free WIFI today)....so see you all next time. Be happy and feel as well as you can! ",

Last one will be 7/23/09.   Treatment Day itself has never been too bad (though I did take a 2 hour nap when I got home from yesterday's infusion!), but I know I'll be a wreck again once I eat something today -- starting with having to force myself to stay awake to get to, wait for, have my Neulasta shot and finally get home so I can pass out again.   Since my next chemo will be the last, yesterday when my chemo nurse stopped by to see me during treatment, I asked her how long it would take from my last treatment to be Me again -- at least in terms of getting my brainpower and physical energy back, and not having the taste of Sewer Mouth (I know getting My Hair back will take \"forever,\" since I want it LONG again, and I fully expect to need my wig when I go out for at LEAST 2-3 years). I had to ask because since my third round, I haven't been Me at all, and I'm figuring that 6th and last round is going to be much worse on account of the cumulativeness factor that began with the 3rd round -- since which time I've been constantly fatigued and brain dead and had Sewer Mouth (with the sole exceptions of the five minutes after brushing my teeth with Biotene toothpaste and using Biotene mouthwash) -- this applied not just for the first week post infusion, but even in weeks 2 and 3 as I approached the next round and was supposedly \"better.\" Um, no! I was still exhausted, brain dead and had perpetual Sewer Mouth all the way up to the next treatment.   So my chemo nurse said that by 6 months past my last treatment, I should be \"back\" -- but I'll be coming back gradually, not all at once. Well I hope my brain comes back first, because that'll make it easier for me to be patient about the rest.   One more \"new occurrence\" since my last post....I went  on, then went off, an antidepressant. I'd had a psychiatric evaluation on 6/18/09, which resulted in the psychiatrist recommending the SSRI antidepressant Lexapro, which I agreed to try -- started it the next day. I was on it for about a week when I started to actually notice something -- which I thought originally was good, until I, er, \"investigated.\" The good -- my long-lost libido seemed to be making something of a comeback! Since my Pack Rat wasn't here, and I was actually REALLY in the mood, I did what I normally do in that position (remember, we're in a long distance relationship) -- I took matters into my own hand, shall we say. Well, it took me WAY longer than usual to get to the \"finish line,\" and when I did finally get there, it was nowhere near the \"full bodied depth and intensity\" which is normal for me. VERY frustrating, on all accounts. But I decided it was a fluke -- until the exact same thing happened again the next day. At that point (last Friday), I went online looking for Lexapro SEs again, figuring I might have forgotten something in my original research (conducted thoroughly in the midst of chemo brain) -- and there it was, 18-50% of Lexapro patients had SEs of sexual dysfunction, up to and including \"anorgasmia.\"  Um, no way!  NO NO NO NO NO! That is on my WILL NOT TOLERATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES list. So....   Not knowing how how long one has to be on Lexapro for withdrawal issues to occur, I stayed on it for the weekend (and was grateful I didn't get \"excited\" again), but first thing Monday morning I called the psychiatrist, told him what happened and said I wanted OFF the stuff -- so could I just stop, or did he have to taper me down? He said I'd only been on it for 10 days so I could just stop -- so I did!   Two days after going off, I had another \"I'm in the mood\" episode, and when I dealt with it in the aforementioned manner -- yeah it still took longer, and neither was the finish as good as it had been pre-Lexapro, there WAS a noticeable improvement. Now I'm 5 days off, have had no w/d effects, and am optimistic that I should be back to normal in that regard in time for my Pack Rat's next visit (July 10-12). Yeah, well since I'm still on chemo, I know I'll only have minimal inspired energy like his last visit, but at least what we do \"do,\" I'll be fully functional.   Damn. It's time to eat something (not really hungry now, but I'd better eat something before it gets \"too late\")....so then I can fight the urge to nap... and drag myself to the Neulasta injection...eeesh...   ~Lena.",

Other than that, if you have adequate night vision/don't mind being out after dark, maybe a night shift job would be a good idea? I worked 2nd shift at one job for awhile (4:30 PM to 12:30 AM) and I LOVED it: it was PERFECT for my body clock, but dagnabbit after 6 months they changed my hours back to 8:30 AM-4:30 PM, and it was only a very few more years before my night vision -- which is now nonexistent so it's DANGEROUS for me to drive after dark -- began to decline...it started to \"go\" in mid-30s...was \"iffy\" when I hit 40, by my mid-40s had progressed to \"scary\" and now at 49, it's all gone (my maternal grandparents both had this problem...). However, I loved working the late shift while it lasted and I could do it. Another option perhaps -- how about telecommuting/working from home at least part of the time? If only my brain would come back, this is something *I* would be seriously looking into!  Dunno if you can do it with your current position or not (maybe you could arrange for an occasional work-from-home week when the only stuff you have is administrative/not meeting with other education professionals or students' parents?), but if you do decide to change careers it could work, depending on what kind of work you pick and the company or other organization you work for. My Pack Rat totally loves it. His current schedule: he works from home for three weeks, then he works at his company's office for one week. He's doing R&D, mechanical design. During his work from home weeks, when consultation with his manager is necessary, they Skype and/or call each other whichever is applicable for the situation. So maybe working from home would be good for you too?  Well gotta go..... ",

      "Content": "Jan 3, 2011 09:54AM - edited Jan 3, 2011 10:00AM by Lena Hmmm Helen, now that you mention it......yeah....before my diagnosis -- even before my right breast started turning into a rock and no I didn't have any \"separate lumps\" to find (so I didn't have the remotest idea I had or was going to get BC) -- for a year or two or so, my left hip had been bothering me occasionally -- yes, waking me up at night...well, more like early in the morning before the alarm clock would go off so I could get up for work -- and it would hurt worse while in process of getting out of bed, but once I was out of bed the pain would stop. I'd get this pain for a few mornings (up to a week, sometimes 2 weeks) consecutively, the pain usually tending to worsen, but then it would stop! Weeks or months would go by and I wouldn't have it at all. Then it would be back for another spell; on and off, on and off -- hurt for a week or two, get better for a few weeks or months, then pain again...It was just so weird (but each time the pain came back, yes it seemed worse and took longer to go away after getting out of the bed). Seeing that I was over 40 (43/44 or 44/45 years old) when I noticed it, I attributed it to \"Getting Old.\" In fact, it made me think of my Pack Rat's (then) 70+ year old father -- who ended up having hip replacement surgery, and who also just turned 80. I didn't recall how old he was when his hip started bothering him, but he had terrible pain from it for YEARS; I just don't know how many. My Pack Rat used to say his dad ate OTC pain meds like candy and it barely helped him. Even after his \"rotted-out\" hip was diagnosed, he had to wait till he had insurance to pay for the operation, so it went on for a very long time. But that's what I thought of -- HIS condition, not the idea that *I* might have my very own cancer or any other not-limited-to-people-over-60 kind of illness. Even \"simple\" osteoarthritis didn't occur to me! When I was actually diagnosed with BC and had my first oncologist appointment after the positive biopsy of IBC, he asked me if I'd been having any \"bone pain\" and, having not had the hip pain in a few weeks at that time, I had totally forgotten about it so I said no! But then he sent me for staging scans, and BOOM, what shows up on all of 'em -- PET, CT and Bone scans  -- a met on my left iliac bone. So then I told him about this intermittent hip pain after being told I had the bone met...\"OMG, so THAT's what that was all about?!\" Um. Yeah.  OK.  Chemo took the met down considerably but not totally. The intermittent episodes of hip pain became more intermittent, and seemed to eventually go away \"for good\" (and then my recent Oct or Nov 2010 regression scan seemed to confirm the met was as gone as it was possible to get). The hip pain I have now which I only just got a couple days ago, after not having had hip pain like this in just over a year (the hopeful sex injury LOL) isn't exactly like any of the prior hip pain -- while it's on the same level as the old pain (same part of the hip, with same intensity of pain itself) -- it hasn't woken me up at night or early in the morning and I only get the new one while walking or moving -- the old pain used to go away totally after I got out of bed, and I had to do a LOT of walking (several blocks or more) before it would hurt from walking. This new pain -- I can't even walk across a room without getting it. I added painkiller (a dose of my remaining Darvocet) to my usual morning meds/supplements today, and it's a little better. Whether this pain will go away on its own or not, though, I know I have to talk about pain meds with my PCP when I see her on the 12th. Dunno if you know this or not, but Darvocet (and Darvon) have just been recalled by the FDA because they \"may\" cause cardiac problems. My old onc had given me the Darvocet a couple of times last summer for the knee pain, shoulder pain and hurting feet from AIs. I still have over half the second bottle left because I take it very sparingly. It DOES help my pain, but it also makes me sleepy and slows my already deficient brain down, so I'm reluctant to take it when I know I have things to do which might or DO include having to drive someplace. I was shocked when I got the letter from Dartmouth about Darvon/Darvocet recall -- I got it on the first day I'd taken my Darvocet in maybe 2 months! Well I hadn't had any problems from my Darvocet other than the sleepiness/fuzz brain, OTCs don't put a dent in my pain, and the Oxycodone I still have (which I got for that mystery painful leg injury), well that's TOO strong for the AI pain -- so I decided OK, I'll take the Darvocet I have left sparingly/as needed, but since I now know I won't be getting any more, I'll need to make AI pain management a subject of discussion the next time I see my doctor. What I need: something stronger than OTCs but not AS strong as Oxycodone and its relatives (and hopefully something that won't kill my brain or make me sleepy). Oh, and YES, of course I TOTALLY AND THOROUGHLY enjoyed every NANOSECOND of the Big Bang. Our relationship, like most, isn't perfect, but it seems our worst particular relationship flaws show up out of bed. The major ones: I get upset sometimes about his utter lack of ability to perceive time and disconnection from the spacetime continuum, and he could definitely live without my \"all or nothing\" approach to most things. But IN bed? There is no such thing as \"bad sex\" with that Pack Rat --SQEEEEEK! :-D. The occasional encounters of ours which AREN'T totally hot as hell and having me explode repeatedly are the ones we're trying something new which I end up finding more amusing than erotic, so I do more laughing than \"exploding.\"  But laughing is fun too, and sometimes this inventiveness DOES result in something explosively erotic which then gets added to the repertoire -- so it's always enjoyable one way or the other. LOL! The only \"complaint\" I've ever had about our sex life was \"we don't do it often enough.\" Which is obvious from the long distance relationship perspective, but actually it still applies even now (not as much as it did before I moved, but yeah, I still do wish we'd get a little bit more LOL... well maybe in the summer when The Great Outdoors is an option, and then when he finishes remodeling his now unusable bedroom (which he was going to do this year, um, 2010, \"finally,\" except then he \"had to\" help me move)...well we shall see.... Judy: what \"American experience\" were you expecting? Amy -- you still going to the gym? I made the mistake of walking to Rite Aid yesterday but as I walked, noticed there's a gym here too, yes, in walking distance from my house! I doubt I could afford joining, especially since I'd probably need a \"special\" trainer to show me exercises which wouldn't hurt my AI-afflicted joints (presuming there ARE any: but I'd need to actually go to a gym and talk to a trainer to even find out). But I was so shocked, my initial reaction to seeing a gym this close to where I live was, \"Oh cool, I'd be able to WALK to and from the gym!\" but then, since my hip was hurting me, \"and geeze, isn't this ironic when I finally even think I MIGHT want to join a gym PLUS find one I can walk to, now I bet there's NO more kinds of exercise I can do without going into agony or falling and actually hurting myself!\" I had been doing all that walking because between my stroke paralysis/impaired balance and the AI pain, walking seemed to be the only kind of exercise I COULD do, and now walking hurts! GRRR! And I'm having trouble with these last 5 pounds, too. I got down to 129/130 but keep going up and down from 129.something to 130.something. It's maddening. I'll bet exercise would help me kick off these last few pounds (I'm still on the diet, and calculations tell me I'm still burning a little more than I'm taking in, but not as much as I was when I used to go for those daily walks; my BMR slowed down and exercise gets it up), but between the cold and the pain (and probably not being able to afford the gym anyway, which even if it turns out a trainer says I was right, that walking really is the only exercise I can do, I'd still be able to walk on a treadmill if I joined a gym so solve the cold problem that way) and the pain, I don't think it'll be happening any time soon if at all. Oh well.... I think the Darvocet is making me space headed. I guess I'd better go do something that doesn't require any brains. Have fun and feel as good as you can. ::::sigh:::: ",

I may be at a plateau NOW, but I HAVE lost 25 of the 30 pounds I wanted to lose, so it must have worked to a point, right? The obsession was what enabled me to design my very own personalized diet plan, and keep it that way -- I actually tweak my caloric allowances based on what my body is actually doing, and I know what it's doing based on my daily weight and trend data! And yes it means getting on the scale and calculating the trend data (to separate the signal from the noise, so to speak) EVERY DAY. But when you're obsessed anyway, doing all that stuff and the meal planning kinda keeps you busy. Especially when you have permanent chemo brain and it takes longer than it would have taken you if you'd tried to do it before chemo! Well I found out the reason for the plateau is because my body is too \"used to\" the diet now and my metabolism is kicking down in response to me giving it \"too few\" calories (well um yeah, I want to LOSE weight, five more pounds down and THEN I can go to maintenance level, which can be noticeably more than while trying to lose) -- so I'm going to try to shake it up with a combination of eating a tiny bit more, and alternating \"eat more\" and \"eat less\" days. It'll average out to ~800 more calories per week than I've been eating for the last few months, but that's either a nice treat (an extra glass or two of wine per week, or maybe some macaroni and cheese which I cut way down on), or getting to have occasional second helpings or maybe some serious decadence: French toast with real New England maple syrup for breakfast once a week. Oh, and Betsy -- it's not WHAT someone eats and drinks, it's how many CALORIES they're eating and drinking which determine lose, gain or stay the same weight. Eat less than burn= lose (eventual plateau not included LOL); eat exactly what is burned (which is the number of calories the body NEEDS) = stay the same weight; eat more than burn = gain weight. Even though losing weight is a healthy thing for overweight people to do, a weight loss diet itself is not absolutely or necessarily synonymous with a \"healthy and balanced\" diet (of good fresh fruits and veggies, grains, poultry, fish, meat and dairy). More \"moving stuff\" in the kitchen sorta...changed the refrigerator racks this time...oh and the electric stove is OK...my TEA KETTLE was the water culprit...it had a tiny area of corrosion I couldn't see and was leaking! My Pack Rat is here (unconscious at the moment, of course ;-) ) and as it happens, he says ALL of the technical difficulties I had during the past week were due to problems with the equipment itself, and that I had done everything HE would have done with regards to the troubleshooting, taking apart and hooking up stuff. The power supply plug for the \"magic cable\" (and the 16 GB flash drive) were both \"broken\" due to cheap construction -- he saw a bad crystal and lousy soldering job when he opened up the flash drive, and he pointed out to me the \"moving\" inputs on the magic cable which should have been \"stable,\" and though he got it plugged in and usable, it was hard for him to plug it in too! :-O He even called my magic marker to denote the \"first\" input to be industry standard. OMG.  But now with the magic cable (which I DID know would diagnose the problem, I was right about THAT) -- it turns out the problem was with the hard drive, not the enclosure as I had suspected...and (stroke of luck?) when he came over tonight he brought the 500 GB drive from last year's OWC fiasco last year (drive was good, but the enclosure was bad). So tonight we built a \"new\" 500 GB external backup drive using the OWC HD and the enclosure which had formerly held the HD which just died! -- OOH, partitioning is done NOW!  :-D Anyway, he says wants to \"autopsy\" my dead 500 GB drive, and he said I should stick with name brand flash drives, even though most electronics he says it doesn't make a difference -- so we went to Newegg.com and I saw a Sandisk (a brand we're both familiar with). But when we saw that costs twice as much as the Bargain (no-brand) one I bought which turned out not to work (due to construction errors he pointed out to me when he took it apart), he happily volunteered to buy the broken one from me because he knows how to fix it (and he WANTS to get back into electronics component level troubleshooting/repair), and also that way I could put that money towards the Sandisk one which will work and therefore get it without spending more than I had spent on the Bargain (no-brand) one in the first place. So that's how THAT all worked out. I still do wish I could have fixed all those problems myself though, without HAVING TO have him help me...does that make sense?....sigh.... OK gotta go get off the Quicksilver here to begin making the new external backups from scratch...that'll probably take all night.... Well...catchya all next time....",

I'm told (by the lady who called to set up the scheduling this morning) that my oncologist will also be prescribing me an anxiolytic medication to take before the procedure. 2. Monday 4/18 PT/INR blood test to see how it is post Coumadin (vampire will drink from the port then flush it since I still have it and it'll be time for a flush anyway). 3. Tuesday 4/19: 8:30 AM dual core needle biopsies. Live, in stereo.  :-P  This all works around the OTHER upcoming medical appointments -- with the PCP, psychotherapist and psychiatrist, that is.  This isn't the first time I've thought about mastectomy -- bilateral yes, but not in general. Remember how I got railroaded into chemo because the oncologist who diagnosed me said I was inoperable because my tumor was too big and into the chest wall nodes but also said chemo could shrink it to operable size? (but AFTER I finished the chemo, he tells me Stage IV patients only have mastectomies if their tumors are breaking out of the skin of their breasts -- and mine never did that?) Well, while I was still under the misapprehension that I was having chemo for the sole purpose of making it POSSIBLE for me to have a mastectomy/get rid of the tumor before it got bigger and messier, I both did research AND talked it over with my Pack Rat (including showing him bookmarks I made of website pictures with and without recon).  At first when I started the research, I was extremely impressed with the recons I saw pictures of (shocked at how nice it looked, to be honest), plus, since IMO I had too much belly fat, was thinking of the snide opinion I'd had about my body for the past 10-15 years anyway, \"I wish I could take this gut and move it into my chest, then I could have nice big breasts instead of this awful fat gut!\" LOL -- well geez, now I actually have an excuse to do just that!  (I am not now and never was fat anyplace ELSE, ONLY and ALWAYS just in the belly!) Buuuuutttttt.....there was the OTHER part of my research since I had also just joined BCO, so in addition to looking for pictures and general medical information about mastectomy and reconstruction, I added reading in the surgery and recon areas of BCO to at least get something of an idea what it would be like in terms of risks, pain and recovery time. THAT was when I decided I did NOT want to do recon. I'm a total sissy when it comes to pain and I'm already disabled, and on top of that, this procedure is 100% cosmetic and 0% medically necessary. When I showed all the info to my Pack Rat, saying I liked the look of recon but was kind of afraid to do it, he immediately said \"Go flat on that side! It's not worth risking any more surgery than what a doctor says is necessary.\" Besides, I'd still have the OTHER breast (more on that to come). Also, if I wanted my chest to look \"even\" in clothes when I went out, I could stuff a sock in my right bra cup: no pain, no money spent either. So that was the original conclusion around the time of my diagnosis in 2009. After THAT oncologist (the original one before I moved) told me no mastectomy, I was actually kind of relieved even though I was pissed off thinking I'd ruined my life with the chemotherapy for nothing. My Pack Rat was shocked when I told him the oncologist said surgery wasn't standard of care for Stage IV patients, all along he has thought I should have a mastectomy, saying \"the fewer tumor cells you have, the fewer new metastases you can get.\" I actually thought, even though I was pissed about not being dealt with honestly from the beginning, that since I already had mets anyway, it wouldn't make any difference (in THIS respect I believed my oncologist, I just wish he would have told me SOONER), so for me it was off the table and I thought \"just as well, I've had my fill of medical procedures anyway.\" Since my right breast was mangled and shrunken, I simply went ahead with my \"invention\" of the Bra Sock to even out the look of my chest when I was going out (in warmer weather: in winter I wear so many layers and big sweaters or flannel shirts my chest was totally buried I didn't need a bra at all!). And then I actually sprung $19.95 for a breast pad to stuff in there, looks better and is easier to put in than the Bra Sock. My new oncologist had been thinking differently though -- more like my Pack Rat actually. She believed if I had no other evidence of disease, taking that breast off would put me in full remission. And, my last 3 scans were (June 2010) Stable; (Oct/Nov 2010) Stable, and (January 2011) Regression. So she said at the very least she wanted to re-biopsy the original breast tumor spring 2011, after another scan around March or so...which is the one I recently had, original tumor active again. ummm anyhoo....rambling again am sick of writing this post  :::::sigh:::: My Pack Rat is supportive, yeah, and while he wouldn't stop me if I WANTED to go through the extra procedures for recon, he says he has no problem with all flat (yeah we did talk about it recently, a couple days or so after he found the New Lump in my other breast) he was saying a BMX would be the sensible thing for me to do). Thing is, yes, Geri, yes, Judy, *I* am the one with the vanity problem -- but in addition to the unfeminine appearance of no breasts, there's MORE -- the sexual sensitivity of my breasts -- which may \"only\" be 34C in size (or now, the left one is still C but the right looks like a B or so) but function exquisitely when it came to getting me turned on -- this has always been a very big part of our bedtime enjoyment. The thing is he has been repeatedly telling me for 8+ years now how MY being turned on is what turns HIM on. Since reconstructed breasts look nice but have no sexual feeling, and since I'll lose ALL sexual feeling in my chest ANYWAY if I have the BMX, in addition to the looks issue (which I realize is probably all my own personal vanity hangup) is that if I can't get turned on, he won't either, so I'll be sexually useless. Me being sexually useless means I will lose the last and only pleasure I get out of life anymore and on top of that, won't give HIM any pleasure either (except maybe as \"just a friend\" since we'll probably always be INTELLECTUALLY compatible) and why the hell should HE have to deal with a lousy or nonexistent sex life? If all I felt about him was \"just friends\" I wouldn't care and would tell him it would OK with me if he found a hot new girlfriend, but because I love him \"that way\" too, that would kill me.  Gotta go. It takes too long to cry and post at the same time. ",

Too late for me now on that one though -- I lost all my excess weight so there's nothing left to make breasts out of anymore...not even if I eat a slice of cheesecake (with a chocolate rat cookie) each and every day for the rest of this week. Which I'm going to be doing. Ohhhhhhh Did I just say CHEESECAKE????????? OMG YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!! My Pack Rat came over with the birthday cheesecake last night, which had a surprise trim of chocolate cookie rats surrounding the cheesecake on the platter. They had almonds for ears, twizzie stick pieces for tails and so on: totally edible but so cute I felt bad about eating them, but can't help it, they smelled so good so I ate one, it tasted as good as it smelled and looked, so now I'll have to eat all of 'em.  And since I so rarely WANT to eat chocolate, you know THESE are GOOOOOOD! The cheesecake was totally TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!! My Pack Rat was shocked while I ate it, he said I sounded like I get when I'm sexually aroused and was seriously wondering if cheesecake was an aphrodisiac! Yeah he actually asked me if cheesecake made me horny! LOL It doesn't, but the last time I had cheesecake THIS GOOD was a number of years ago on one of my very rare \"fancy restaurant\" dining out occasions...some Italian place, I don't even remember the name of it. But THIS cheesecake was EQUALLY WONDERFUL as the fancy expensive restaurant's. I knew she was a good baker (my Pack Rat's cousin's wife), but I never had her cheesecake; I don't even know if she's ever even MADE cheesecake before, but it wouldn't surprise me if this was her first one. The woman is a freakin' FOOD WHIZ, for both cooking regular meals and baking all kinds of desserts. I've had various of her cookies, plus pie, brownies, carrot cake, \"orangies,\" banana bread and fresh baked bread too. So what happened was my Pack Rat asked her what went into a cheesecake, she told him, he bought it all and she turned it into a cheesecake and came up with the little rat cookie idea herself.  So last night we each had a slice of cheesecake (mine was bigger LOL) and a chocolate rat cookie, and I am going to RELISH a slice of that cheesecake and a chocolate rat cookie EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK!! Oh, and he also gave me a 750 GB portable HD, too. OMG. Not only will I be able to carry the content of ALL my computers around with me to access on the iBook, I'll be able to use those 250 GB drives I'd bought for the Quicksilver for the Music Project (digitizing my whole music collection of records and tapes to MP3s.).  Pasteurella's is almost ready to be painted (just one more round of caulk and some sanding), too, plus, of course, the decorative stuff. I think it was the wine but something made me \"brave\" enough to show the Frankenstein Chest to my Pack Rat after doing my evening round of PT exercises, which I showed him prior to taking my shirt off and showing him the Chest. It shocked the crap out of him -- he said he'd pretty much known what to expect, only mine was much BETTER than he expected to see!  :-O OMG. He said the surgeon did such an extra fabulous job I ought to profusely compliment her -- a FEW times, not just once.Then he also complimented ME on having such a sleek and streamlined body. He actually still thinks I'm sexy to LOOK at! :-O And now that my shirt was off, he stripped me the rest of the way naked with his TEETH! (yeah, he did). No time to turn off the light, so this was the first time we did it with the light on in what, almost two years?! He even says I look UNIQUE now and he thinks my body is in better shape now than it was when he met me! So okay, I actually got inspired to do something I was originally thinking that post-BMX I probably wouldn't ever want to do again, even in the dark: jump his bones and ravish him. Oh....and that business I had for my first two weeks after surgery with that difficulty opening my mouth/painful clicking jaw -- not only is it all gone now, it passed the final test. See, I didn't eat JUST cheesecake and a chocolate rat cookie for dessert last night.....  ;-)   (well hey, he made me explode a FEW times, so I say he DESERVED to be eaten alive, raped and pillaged! LOL)  OK, I got some Sims modding stuff to do.....catch you next time....  I'm probably going to need a nap later.......... ",

Maybe the Ritalin really does only go so far; chemo brain really IS forever. :-P I'm not even going to TRY to \"restore\" the Lost Post because quite frankly I'm too ill and exhausted to even make the attempt. I went from feeling good both physically and emotionally for the FIRST TIME in OVER TWO YEARS -- to suddenly being walloped by what for now I'm going to call the Mystery Ailment. Don't ask me what it is, I have no frickin idea and the doctors don't know yet either. It struck on July 4th, I've been in the ER twice (last week) and got to see my PCP while actually having an \"attack\" of it yesterday, but I'm only able to say this about it: all the malfunctions FEEL GI-tract related: \"gas\" pain, constipation, diarrhea. The pain was so bad (it took IV Dilaudid to dispel it) they even CT scanned me for kidney stones, no I don't have that, and no I don't have intestinal contents backed up either so there is no explanation. The days I'm not in pain I feel very weak (like right now for instance) usually. It comes and goes -- feel good enough to do something and I'm wiped for DAYS if I'm lucky (lucky means just weak, little or no pain). Then there's the pain days (yesterday was horrible). Usually the Percocet works now, but of course I'm only able to take that when I don't have to drive. And THOSE days are coming to an end starting Monday because that's when I start rads. So now I can only expect the worst, going into rads feeling like this. Given the facts of the CT scan interpretation and PCP's agreement that this could possibly be cancer related (as in additional metastasis, this time to the peritoneum), now I'm wondering what in hell \"good\" the rads are going to do. But I also have an onc appointment on Wednesday and my PCP is forwarding all the information (from ER and her examination of me yesterday) to my oncologist and we have to take it from there. Well in the meanwhile I managed to find some time to lie on the couch with my iBook yesterday late afternoon and discover a large number of scientific papers on breast cancer which had metastasized to the peritoneum. So although this is a rare complication of BC,it always, at least in these papers, first presents as GI complaints -- the exact same ones I'm having, in fact. I've gone for a couple of walks this week but am just not able to do it regularly like I'd hoped. Geri I was thinking of you ummm, hmmm, one of the last few \"good\" days that I had, fairly recent maybe earlier this week but can't remember now, but what made me think of you was a Carwash Downpour, the first one this year which didn't come with lightning -- so I washed my car with it. One of the next door neighbors was home (his car was there) but he didn't come out and \"catch\" me. Amy I hope you're feeling much better now and (hm it's Saturday) enjoying your vacation. Well it's coming up on a month since Judy's move, but in a proportional comparison to my move, I'm not at all surprised she hasn't posted (I say we should give her until... OK... hmmmm August 1st or so, before it's \"OK\" to worry about her). But Judy if you've had time to READ here at least, I wish for you the MINIMUM POSSIBLE amount of chaos!  Gotta go. I'm still putting away the laundry I did on Thursday -- finally just got around to that NOW (as in today). Every time that tires me, I come in here and write a few sentences as \"sit down and rest\"). ",

I used to hate the wrestling matches with my wig, but up to that almost a year PFC point, well, topless was NOT an option for me! I don't know what I'd DO with a compression sleeve or foobs. I don't know if I mentioned this, but a couple weeks before my BMX, my cancer center's \"shared decision making\" department had sent me this DVD all about mastectomy and ALL the post-operative options, i.e., very detailed video and explanations of ALL the different kinds of recon plus breast prostheses, pros and cons of all, pictures of all. When I watched the woman in the DVD put her foobs into the mastectomy bra pocket and SHE had to futz a little with it, my heart sank: I KNEW I was going to HAVE TO learn how to deal with flat! I mean I'm sure they didn't use a woman with a partially paralyzed hand to demonstrate how to put on the fake breasts! Question if I may, Helen; is wearing a wig a wrestling match for you, or can you just put one on easily on the first try? Or at least, is it easier or harder and more time consuming to put on/adjust a wig than it is to do the comb-overs and powder sprinkling to hide having so little hair? From what you describe, it sounds like a wig might be easier and you'd at least find your appearance tolerable. Crying on Wellbutrin and feeling like emotional crap -- you're still taking the Arimidex, aren't you? I cried a lot and felt like nonstop emotional crap while I was taking that, too -- yes, in spite of the Wellbutrin and even when I started to see a counselor. You're not alone.  Of all the issues you have, IMO the only one you can really change is the weight. You can't change the fact of the cancer or that the chemo destroyed your hair. You can't change the SEs of AIs, or the lymphedema or the flat chest unless you wear foobs. But the weight, yes you can, believe it or not.  I know I posted this way back when ALL of us were frequently complaining about our weight, but I'll post it again: http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html The guy who wrote this was 70 pounds overweight and this was how he ditched his excess poundage. OK, I only had 30 pounds to lose, but I lost them by using this guy's plan, which he calls the Hacker's Diet, as the base upon which I designed my own diet in regards to WHAT I LIKE to eat, how I cook and so on, including not having to spend any more money on food than I would have anyway. Anyway, this works and when you base it on YOUR food and cooking preferences, maintenance is easy -- so you don't have to get trapped in that yo-yo dieter syndrome. Went to the store today. Bought more oranges (among other things) -- didn't bring any upstairs though. LOL. Then had lunch with my Pack Rat at the general store in his town, and he said he'd finished painting my new fender and he wanted to compare its color to what's actually on my car, so I followed him back to his nest. Fender looks great and he says he has the headlight assembly in a box, so when he comes back from CT he can finally fix my car and I can do all the NH license, registration and inspection stuff. Yeah he switched up his home vs. office work schedule again. His boss is a medieval warrior and Pennsic is coming up, so he doesn't want to end up in the office while his boss (who shields him from all the political bullshit) is on vacation fighting at Pennsic. So if he goes to the office for this week, he'll be able to work from home the week after, while his boss is on vacation. Oh but I digress...after checking out the new fender, and my telling him from having noticed driving behind him after lunch that if HE expects to pass inspection, he better check ALL his taillights first because from what I saw, at least two (a rear turn signal and the opposite rear brake light) don't work. ....and then there was the Picnic Table. Did I ever mention the Picnic Table....? Damn right I took a 2 hour nap as soon as I got home! LOL ",

And I was still nauseous this morning, including during the drive in the downpour to go get my rads. BUUUUT...when I came home from rads, even though I immediately passed out on the couch for 2 hours, when I got up I actually felt like eating a bunch of fresh cherries. And I'm not nauseous anymore, AND I had the first actually NORMAL BMs since this all started. Dare I think maybe you're right, it's a bug (but then again I don't know of any STOMACH \"bugs\" that last for more than 48 hours and I've had this for just over 2 weeks I think), and it's on its way out? Yeah sure. OK, I'm getting better. But as someone who sees the glass as on the floor broken in bitty shards, I'll have to figure it going like this: I'll get better and be OK till the weekend or maybe even into early next week -- and THEN I'll get hit with rads SEs. One down, 32 more to go. Yes I slathered on the Jeans cream, but I think that only works for the SKIN, not the FATIGUE. Ah well. Hey Judy, if you're out there: I'll trade you a stomach bug for your moving chaos! I'll take your place with the work of unpacking and cooking dinners for you and your family, and all you need to do is lie in bed or on the couch having bad gas pains (you can use my percocet), constipation, diarrhea and a little projectile vomit.....OK? Whaddaya say? Whaddaya mean NO? I thought it was an offer you couldn't refuse!  :-O LOLOLOLOLOL",

Feel like I wanna die because I walked all the way here from the far parking lot carrying my iBook, which after awhile feels like it weighs a ton.   Betsy -- OK I'm putting Aquaphor on the list of things I plan to ask the RO about when I see her on Friday. Thanks for the suggestion. LOL and yeah, my cars have been shuttlecrafts since #2. #1 (1976 Chevy Nova) was simply the Brown Beauty (because my then BF's car was the Black Beauty mostly LOL), but after that: #2; 1983 Chevy Celebrity, was the Death Shuttle because it had a penchant for leaving me stranded on the Garden State Parkway in really bad weather (and in other places too)...#3, my favorite 1990 Mazda 323SE which I had for 13 years was Shuttlecraft Eridani (who WAS completely reliable until  the last two years), also died on the Garden State Parkway -- just before I would have crossed the border into NY, was en route to see my Pack Rat....#4 was Shuttlecraft Nevasa, a 1989 Volkswagen Jetta my Pack Rat found for me the week after Eridani died...and we got her on the road and able to JUSSST pass inspection for $300 and my promise to let his cousin have it back at the end so he could have the front struts or something like that...well Nevasa was about as reliable as the Death Shuttle (except at least when SHE stranded me somewhere, it was LOCAL and not on a highway of any kind). However problematic she was though, she still lasted almost 2x longer than expected (Pack Rat gave her a year), and just long enough to accomplish her purpose: to last long enough for me to get a job and have some time to establish a good reputation there so I could get a better car - I was between jobs when Eridani died. So RIP Shuttlecraft Nevasa, who I had from October 2004-June 2006 (my Pack Rat was able to take her back to NH so his cousin got the struts back and they both took out what other few good parts were left). So, Shuttlecraft T'Kiri is #5. And yes, she's got a Vulcan name. :-) And given the shape I'M in, it looks like SHE is going to be the one who lives long and prospers!   OK...gotta go for now.   ",

I know, I originally figured you'd be in chaos until the 1st, but now I'm realizing how it took me longer to get back here after my (considerably lesser) move than I had planned, plus, I'm romantically involved with a Pack Rat who's totally disconnected from the spacetime continuum as we know it, which means I'm used to the idea of plans blowing up in one's face/sudden inexplicable and occasionally protracted delays. So, as the result of my understanding of how E. coli happens, I therefore give you until the 10th. That's 5 more days.  :-) Big day at the treatment center tomorrow...blah. hematologist at 9 AM, rads at 11:45, rad oncologist right after rads, then 1 PM PCP followup concerning my kidney illness/hospital stay.  :::::sigh::::: ...and I'm doing this why...?  :-P ",

LOL.    Well, OK, maybe something is up for fairly soon -- that trip to NH to spend some time in my Pack Rat's Nest in the North. He mentioned it when we were on the phone the night before last, but at this point it would only be for a weekend. I may have mentioned to you gals that not only does he live a life of total chaos, but he also brings chaos to order, right? So the current chaos is him having to make the bedroom of his house \"habitable\" again. LOL! See, he was going to remodel it and had started, but when he realized it was going to take longer than he thought (plus a job in CT plus other more important Projects came up), not only did he stop working on it, but started using it as a \"storage room\" (yes, even *I* shudder to think, since I know what a Pack Rat he is!) -- so when HE says it's \"uninhabitable\" the way it is now (and that he's been sleeping on a cot in the living room when he's home), I can only laugh my ass off as I take him at his word (there are folks who would consider my apartment as \"uninhabitable,\" and let me tell you, though it's true by \"normal people's\" standards, next to HIM, I'm Martha Stewart!). Ahhh, this is what I get -- albeit happily because I love him like I've never loved anyone in my life -- for having decided that my primary definition of \"the right guy for me\" is \"someone who is as weird, or weirder, than I am.\" Well anyway -- he said he started getting the \"storage\" accumulations out of the bedroom this past weekend and plans to do more with it this coming weekend. Well, his current job is in CT actually kind of makes it a little easier on me with my driving phobia -- I'll be able to meet him there (2-2.5 hour drive: the full drive to NH is 6-8 hours which is why I normally was only going up there once a year except for when he had work in CT). So I meet him in CT when he gets off work, and he takes us the rest of the way. (And, out to dinner, too. :-D). We'll spend the weekend, he'll drive us back to CT and on the Monday morning when he goes to work, I'll come back here. Just like old times, actually, only kind of better since I don't work now. I used to have to work through lunchtimes, stay late and/or go in early to make up the hours permitting me to leave work early on Fridays and come in late Mondays on the occasions I went up there, which was about once or twice a month (in the spring/summer/fall since I'm also afraid of driving in snow). My boss at the time was unexpectedly generous and flexible (as long as I put in my hours/got the work done, she was cool), but it was kind of a strain anyway.    But now I have to figure out how I'm going to deal with being \"away\" for more than a very few hours at the most -- since this whole chemo/hairless thing started, I've pretty much (voluntarily) shut myself in even more than usual: Since April, I've only been out ONCE for anything not actually required (i.e., anything that wasn't doc appts, tests, treatments, chores or errands like food shopping etc), and that one \"unnecessary\" excursion was only for a couple of hours -- I took my iBook to the park -- a five minute walk from my apt building -- on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend, and hung out there playing sims and reading some of my old stories for 2-3 hours (until the iBook's battery needed a recharge LOL). See, for me it's been such a major effort, being unable to go out without wearing a wig, to \"be human\" for more than a short time, that usually I only go out for what's necessary to do and run back to my apt screaming with relief, because what with the hot flashes, the wig would get really uncomfy -- but I'm way WAY too embarrrassed about my appearance without it to even THINK of taking it off anywhere BUT inside my own apt. I can deal with the uncomfy for a few hours for \"absolute necessities,\" but it's really hard otherwise. Even though my Pack Rat has emphatically told me repeatedly I'm seriously overreacting on the Hair Thing (and as I mentioned, he's SEEN my bald head and the Mycelium, although I'm still shuddering to think of those times which I kept at minimum possible), I still feel like being \"away\" for a whole weekend will mean alternating discomfort (keeping my wig on in spite of hot flashes), and then embarrassment if I relent and do take it off, because I simply cannot f***ing stand the way I look bareheaded or even with the scarf -- STILL.  ::::sigh:::: I guess I better figure out how to deal with it though, because, presuming I even live that long, it's going to be several years before I'll have enough of my real hair back to not be embarrassed by the idea of even opening my apt door bareheaded. The last couple days, since this visit idea came up, I've been trying to tell myself, \"instead of the long hair maintenance issues in the past, now it's 'wig issues,' which are 'normal' if I want to look nice.\" But I still have trouble with the idea that I can't just run out the door anymore, even though I've been living with it for five months now, and have been on the insular/hermit-like side since I was in my mid-30s, and it makes me miss my pre-chemo hair (INCLUDING the long showers for extra conditioning/two hours combing it dry after the shower/hairwash) all the more.   OK, enough rambling and ranting here....(sorry girls, looks like I'll NEVER be able to stop ending up in frustrated irrational rantings about the hair unless or until it all grows back).   Chelev -- Yup, you should have seen me with that full bladder ultrasound. When the tech ran the instrument \"too near\" my bladder I exclaimed \"OH!\" involuntarily. The tech asked if she'd hurt me, and I said, \"No, I really just need to use the bathroom.\" It happened 2-3 more times, each time my mention of needing to go to the bathroom becoming more emphatic, up to the final \"I REALLY NEED to use the bathroom NOW!\" LOL! Mmmmm,  looks like I missed whatever post you may have mentioned that you're on Tamoxifen too. But yeah, that waking up in the middle of the night from the hot flashes really sucks! I know how you feel!   Titan -- LOL! Well it wasn't MY dildo (or even really an actual dildo, it just LOOKED like one!), it belonged to the Women's Imaging Center at the hospital associated with my cancer center...and, my Pack Rat's \"toy\" is, er, much better. But remembering that he's a mechanical designer/inventor and, um, has something of a thing for, um, mechanisms (I decline to elaborate any further on this since I know there's at least one self proclaimed prude in here LOL), you gotta figure I just HAD to tell him about it ASAP, especially about the part where the tech asked ME to insert the \"dildo-cam\", at which point I imagined how it would've been if my Pack Rat had been there, I could practically hear his voice in my mind thanking me for giving him a \"show!\" So when I told him about it on the phone that evening, that's when I said he had to use his mechanical and creative genius to invent some kind of device to attach to \"himself\" for if I ever need another transvaginal ultrasound.  And he did say he wished he'd seen the \"show\" (plus said he wanted to \"experiment on me\" hehehe). Oh and yeah, I also saw that other thread here at BCO about BC awareness month and I totally agree with you -- I have had enough breast cancer awareness to last me a lifetime!  Grrrrr!   Alaina -- I keep hearing that term \"new normal\" around here at BCO, but something inside me really rails against it. Probably because I ended up with what some people here might call a \"new normal\" of sorts after my stroke in 1993, and to this day I can't say I EVER really \"got used to\" my left hand being partially paralyzed and my balance being \"off,\" even though it's been this way for almost 16 years (my \"stroke-iversary\" is in November) and I've learned the limits/made what adaptations I could to accommodate/compensate. I just don't consider the aftereffects of this kind of stuff to be \"normal.\" Sure, my energy and mental function have returned a good deal since after finishing chemo, and, I'm once again able to do most things I enjoy doing, but even if all I'd had was the breast cancer, I can't imagine thinking I'd ever be any kind of \"normal\" again. Even if my oncologist decides that a mastectomy won't do me any good so I don't have one, my right breast is still very misshapen and there's no changing that, ever. And of course if I do have a mastectomy, the lack of the breast and any \"battle scars\" I get from the operation will not be normal either. You are absolutely right when you say, \"Nothing will ever be the same again.\"  I hope the torture is getting to be slightly less torturous as you improve your range of motion -- I remember my own physical and occupational therapy after my stroke and that was no picnic either. It rarely qualified as torture, but it was horribly frustrating.  {{{hug}}} Oh, and while I'm with you on the Welch's grape juice (yummmm!), you can keep the pomegranate blueberry and crushed ice! LOL!   Gotta go now, my sims await me.  :-) Catchya next time.   ~Lena.",

The doctor came in, saw it and said I definitely needed a break from treatment so she said 2 days off (Monday and Tuesday), and my own RO, who she said she was going to call, would see me on Wednesday (today), then we'd decide what to do. Then the nurse came back, applied cortisone cream and bandages, which I kept on until this morning (when the nurse took them off me prior to my RO coming in). Well, whatever that doctor said to my RO on Monday gave my RO the idea she should call my MO, so when I saw my RO today -- and she saw the burns and blisters -- she told me she'd talked to my MO and this (her seeing for herself) \"confirmed\" it -- I'm too burned up for any more rads.  So that's it, I stop after having had \"only\" 25 of the originally scheduled 33 treatments, and RO also mentions MO says she wants me to heal up from the rads so she can put me on the Faslodex next month. RO gave me some \"stuff\" she says will help heal it -- several kinds of these soothing dressings which don't stick so I'm to apply them to the burned areas twice a day, lying down for half an hour to keep them on, and for the rest of the time, this silver sulfadiazone cream to put on, and, she'll see me next Thursday to see how I'm doing. Geri...OMG. How's your brother doing?  That really sucks he had complications from the surgery. About the upcoming hurricane: we're supposed to get rain over the weekend, but from what I saw, the eastern part of NH (closer to Maine) is going to be affected a lot worse than us here -- me and my Pack Rat are in southwest NH (closer to Vermont). Dunno that a heavy rainstorm would facilitate a romantic get-together, but, if my fatigue lifts enough and the radiation burns don't hurt so much maybe I'll wash my car in the downpour. LOL Amy -- I had no idea there even WAS an earthquake until late Tues night when I finally got around to reading the news! Sheesh, I should email my Sims hacking mentor and see how she is, since she lives in MD now. But I bet she'll probably laugh at me -- she moved to MD the end of January -- from CALIFORNIA! So this wouldn't be HER first earthquake.",

I actually took two naps yesterday I was so tired. I'm glad you survived!!! How are you feeling today? I hope you're getting the rest I'm sure you need!  Betsy, the reason why colostomy stuff horrifies me so much is because one of my grandmothers had one (for diverticulitis though, not cancer thank goodness), and yes, it was the smell thing. Now, I know what feces smells like -- c'mon now, mine never exactly smelled like roses either, but even so I'd had no idea. Maybe it's the concentration of it in the bag that makes it worse? Well here's what happened: I was early 20-something at the time and had gone out to dinner with my mother, stepfather and Grandma, and as it happened, Grandma and I had to use the ladies' room at the same time; me to urinate, she to change her bag. She actually warned me, but like I said, I knew what \"that\" smells like and nobody's smells good, so why should hers be worse than mine or anyone else's, right? Problem was I said that to her. So into the bathroom we go. I take the stall next to hers and pee. Next thing I know the smell hits -- and not only was it worse than I expected, but it was so bad I was GAGGING. Until this occasion, the only smell to date which had ever elicited me to GAG was the smell of VOMIT. Anyway, I was so embarrassed about the gagging because of how my poor grandmother must feel and how I'd practically promised her it wouldn't bother me. Somehow we got through it (and I knew I would NOT have been able to handle that in person if I couldn't even deal with the smell while separated visually by the bathroom stall door, and I had problems looking at her for the rest of the evening and tried to force myself to act normal) -- in any event, even the mention of a colostomy anything makes me react with the same kind of utter total horror as, say, Helen would if someone talked about taking a knife and literally skinning that new grandbaby alive. Yes, I am THAT horrified at the thought of colostomy anything anywhere near me -- I feel positively certain that I would definitely kill myself if I have to have a colostomy ever.  :-O Judy, I bet it was more fun to be entertained by your neighbors than to do all that entertaining when you had your guests! I hope you're resting too, sounds like you could use it! Yeah Amy, I hate when the posts disappear too. Usually I remember to copy while in progress of writing a post (especially a longer one), but sometimes I don't, so they occasionally get away from me. Dammit!  How's the hiking boots? Titan, I'm usually an idiot when it comes to posting pictures on Photobucket, but OK if your photographer got them up on that other host.  Maybe Amy ought to hire him the next time she takes one of those gorgeous nature vacations she talks about! LOL Ascites update... I don't know if it's the pain pills or the new \"packaging\" I got from Nurse Linda today, but I feel a lot better today. When it comes to the draining/re-dressing issue, I had a really horrible weekend which I won't even go into except to mention the bare essentials of the temper tantrum in which I threw all the medical supplies all over the bathroom and the pack of adult diapers (which thankfully I don't need anymore and won't if this new \"packaging\" of the catheter works). Don't ask the specifics on the new \"packaging\" -- I don't really know, and since (if it'll do what the nurse said it'll do as well as she said it would) it'll only have to be changed WEEKLY, I don't care and it's complicated enough I don't feel like typing that much. So whatever's going on now, hell if I know. I'm just glad I feel better -- even like maybe I can do a little walking. I also made a graph for the amount of ascites drainage, not unlike the one I'd made for the post BMX draining. I'm producing between 500 mL and 1 L of ascites per day. I know, yuck. Next onco appointment is Wednesday. Hey, some of you have onc appointments on Wednesday too, huh? And now, for something completely different. I never in my life thought that the phrase \"too skinny\" would EVER be applicable to ME, but guess what, it does NOW. Except for the ascites area of my lower abdomen and also a moderate amount of edema in my legs/feet, I look like I spent the last few weeks in a concentration camp or something. Actually the first I noticed it, about a week and a half ago (while I still had the pre-paracentesis big belly), my first thought was Kwashiorkor (severe malnutrition) and if only I was black, I would look like those poor malnourished Africans they used to have pictures of in National Geographic. Well now that the huge belly is gone, I look like a cross between an anorexic actress and a Holocaust survivor (my face is gaunt too). My appetite has been coming back since the paracentesis, but apparently not enough I guess, huh? Well, I put being \"too skinny\"  to \"good use,\" you might say. On Saturday early evening, my Pack Rat (who I had not allowed to see me undressed for the past two weeks BTW) called to ask me if I wanted to go out to eat! Timing was bad -- I had actually just eaten a hamburger and bowl full of leftover Chinese food --  but since he suggested the diner in Vermont we both like a lot, and you know I love to just be with him, I said yes anyway, although I'd probably just be having coffee and a slice of pie or something. So he eats an actual meal, and I ask if they have cheesecake (LOL) -- they don't, so I \"settle\" for a slice of homemade pumpkin pie PLUS a small bowl of chocolate ice cream to have with my coffee! He says the \"cheesecake and sex diet\" has to be next (I finally let him see me without clothes yesterday morning). Nope, there hasn't been any sex in the last 2-3 weeks either because I couldn't breathe enough before the paracentesis and then the catheter area hurt too much. (Geez, he actually WANTS to have sex with me?!)  But he's working in CT this week so the cheesecake and sex diet has to wait till at least next week minimum.  Sooooo....I think now that it's lunch time, I'm going to eat a huge chef salad (yup I bought ham and turkey for chef salad at home), and maybe an egg salad sandwich to go with it. I certainly have the \"room\" for a pig-out like that! ",

Although short of last week with him working out of state, we've been getting together about 2-3 times per week. Just having dinner and hanging out watching Star Trek and movies. Tonight we ate out at the Salt Hill Pub (and I had a strawberry dacquiri, lotsa calories in THAT no doubt!). But sex? Tonight was the first sex in 3 weeks actually, and it was largely experimental -- to see if and/or what we actually COULD do anymore (the catheter pain drives me batty because it's so unpredictable, and the ascites bag totally turns me OFF sexually -- every time I see or feel it I feel zero desire and zero confidence, and THOSE were the things he found sexually attractive about me -- how I was such a wild woman in bed! Anyway, we did find a couple of things we can do (although I insisted on nightlight only and my top stayed on cause I didn't even want him to see the OUTLINE of that frickin bag), and I have a mental note of \"a couple strips of paper tape to hold it up\" because there actually will be a next time. This is because even though I hate the damn bag we did find ways to do things that didn't hurt the catheter area at least, and I'd started down the path to getting way into a crying jag depression at the idea of my sex life being over before I had a chance to just die already. And somehow he DOES still want to have me in bed too and says we can work it out and find different ways to try as the situation warrants. And he SAYS the bag won't bother him but if it makes me uncomfortable I can keep the lights low. Not having to see or think about or feel it did help me -- but then I was up on top of him (well hey it's a position with no frontal catheter area body contact which would hurt) -- I did start to get a little bit wild even but as soon as I felt the bag slap against my thigh I TOTALLY lost interest (I wonder if this is what it's like emotionally for impotent men!) and it took awhile to reconvince me/get me back into it, but he did and we tried something else which worked, similar to the \"Less Than Two Weeks After The BMX Sex\" thing (the paper tape idea is so I can try on top again without the damn bag making itself so tactilely obvious). The doorstep is a little small and uncomfortable, but there's probably plenty of room out on the deck for you girls, but you better bring some really warm fleece sleeping bags else you'll freeze to death.  Well maybe Helen is used to that kind of thing so she won't freeze as fast, but still.......! Oh, and I suppose you can go on all your fabulous trips and just live your lives, looks like I'm having a little too much adventure all on my own. But we WILL be doing a train up Mt. Washington soon -- probably the next nice day we get. There's not much left of that now so my Pack Rat already okayed a floating vacation day so he can up and take us there with a fair bit of spontaneity. This is just a day trip, but he always made it sound so cool when he told me about it, it ended up on my Last Bucket List. The Last Bucket List is all small stuff, since I already got to do the Original Bucket List of \"Stuff I GOTTA do before I die!\" before cancer (being a musician, composer, recording artist and performer, being a mad scientist, being a writer and falling in love \"one last time\"). So here's the Last Bucket List (from after getting cancer; no particular priority): Get my ta'Valsh sims up and launched already (recently began some of the major \"download processing\" to set this up finally). Getting ALL my simmies and their stuff backed up to thumb drives or DVDs so I can send them to my Simming buddies so my simmies don't have to die with me.  Mount Washington. One more Birthday Cheesecake Week.  Grow and harvest one more garden. Make and eat a batch of Moon Cookies (LOOOOOONNNNG story! The only people who ever liked them were my grandma who made them, her son (my dad) and I who was totally crazy about them. Finally got my hands on the old family recipe, just need to buy a couple things and make 'em.  Go to a pet shop and play with some real rats (who I KNOW would love me if I hand fed them some Moon cookies!). :-D  Yeah, just a few small things and I can be done. ",

I thought she was coming back but she went away again)  -- dammit that was REALLY bad timing to stop smoking -- I should have waited for myself to FULLY return first,  but what's done is done.  I also had that massive amount of dental work done, and while my teeth LOOK so much better, I was taking pain pills (codeine-Tylenol) for almost three weeks straight because my mouth hurt so bad. I still get occasional twinges (and am watching what I eat, still avoiding crunchy stuff), but it's improving and doesn't get bad or last long enough to take even regular Tylenols anymore.   Also had my last oncologist appointment 11/5/09. I asked him if the Tamoxifen hot flashes would ever go away. He told me that he'd have to put me on an antidepressant to stop them.  After the Lexapro experience this summer, I don't want to go anywhere near antidepressants again. So I'm stuck living with them. :-P I also asked him about when I can have my port removed (I am sooo sick of the sight of that thing). He says he wants to do some more scans in January first. My next checkup with him is 12/31/09, and that's when he'll also order the scans.   And, while my hair is growing, I'm still hideous without my wig. Just as it was when I was totally bald, I only go topless in my apartment -- I'm too embarrassed to go out or even open the apt door being this ugly. Um let's see, I'm 4 months, 1 week and 1 day post chemo, and my hair is only ALMOST as long as Dawn's was in that picture she posted of herself. It's coming in brown now, but has those white \"mycelium tips\" from when the regrowth started. Which means I could get that trimmed off, except I'm too embarrassed to sit topless at a hairdresser's looking like this if another client  comes in and I have to be seen with my hair this short.  :::shudder:::  It's going to be a long time...I just don't think short hair is \"cute\" or \"sassy\" or anything good at all -- especially not on ME -- IT'S UGLY! I am so sick of being ugly.   Any good news -- well, just had four days with my Pack Rat (heh heh heh), and with his help, my computer situation is far upgraded. The Sims are on my \"new\" Mac Mini and I have a nice little ethernet network with the Quicksilver, the Mini, the printer, and the external hard drive -- and also a KVM switch to go back and forth between the Mini and Quicksilver. MUUUCH better.   Chelev -- did you say you had NED?! COOOOOL! Though that infection business sounded really nasty!  :-P   Titan -- You're going topless now? Wow!  :::::faint::::: You're a much braver woman than I am. Sure, I go topless when I'm in my apartment by myself (I had to even when I was bald because in the summer, and with the hot flashes, well I had to!) -- but I still can't make myself even open the apt door this way.  About the weight gain you mentioned -- I had no idea that taking vitamins could do that. I take vitamins too, but my weight has stayed more or less the same through all this. I don't have a scale at home, but when I get weighed at the doctor I take note of it, and I've been fluctuating up and down about 2-3 pounds within my \"uppermost acceptable\" range between onc visits.   Dawn -- About that \"slime flu\" thing -- that's what kids are: plaguemeisters! Yeah, libido is good now, and no sexual problems (this is why I don't want to try any more antidepressants: blunted hard-to-reach orgasms are more depressing than depression!) Oh, and about my continuing hot flashes, my Pack Rat commented on one I had in the middle of the night while he was here -- I woke him up by furiously kicking the covers off myself.  Are you on Tamoxifen? Hot flashes are a SE of Tamoxifen, which I started taking the week after I finished chemo. I had bad hot flashes from chemo too.   Betsy -- Glad to hear you're doing so well. :-)  Your caramel slugs remind me of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus cupcakes I made for one of my former bosses on his birthday (um yeah, that's when I was working as a microbiologist). I had made miniature chocolate cupcakes and iced them with blue-purple icing so they'd look Gram positive -- I got the color by putting blue and red food coloring in plain white icing.  Then I arranged them on platters in clusters (Staphylococcus) and chains (Streptococcus). Oh, that was a lot of fun seeing everyone react to them (my sick sense of humor was well known). One person said, \"You eat one first,\" (hehehe) and my boss loved them.    JudyNaomi -- Hope the heartburn is getting better, and hmmm, you're also getting brave with the hair? Wow.   Well, gotta go now. Take care everybody!   ~Lena.  ",

Yup, long time no see. Glad you're doing OK. Amy! You're gonna get the DILDO-CAM (the transvaginal ultrasound)! LOL! After my last CT scan (August 09) turned up a suspicion of fibroid tumors, my onc sent me for both transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasounds, so I've had it (and yes, these scans confirmed I do have fibroids). I got the expression \"dildo-cam\" from one of my net buddies who had several of both kinds of pelvic ultrasounds during her problematic pregnancy (her baby turned out to be OK but was still born a couple months premature) -- and when I had mine, I instantly saw why my friend called it the dildo-cam! It even wore a condom! LOL. My Pack Rat got a kick out of it when I told him about it. Sorry about the blood and pain and Tamox complications which are a prelude to this, though -- that's horrible and I hope you get better soon. Somehow my Tamox SEs (the hot flashes -- they're awful, they wake me up in the middle of the night, but so far they're the only out-of-control problem I seem to be having from taking Tamoxifen) suddenly don't seem AS bad when I read about this. Yup I'm still hideous without my wig of course, so Helen, I'm still with you on that one, not opening my door without the wig on, much less going out and doing things. Till next time....  ~Lena. ",

EEESH! I guess my sense of humor isn't as black and morbid as I once thought it was, because if it was, I probably WOULD celebrate it.  BetsyBuzz -- I think my hair is coming in slightly wavy now, which is how my pre-chemo hair was. It's not long enough that I can pass for human yet, but if it continues on its current progression I'll be happy with it once there's ENOUGH of it that I look like a human. I still have the imbalance of a lot on top, not as much on the sides and back.  Oh, and my shower-taking has made a stride towards the normal as of this week too. That's because I have (just barely) enough hair to justify using conditioner on it now (I want it to grow in long and beautiful, so now that there's enough for conditioner, I'm starting to condition again). It's just that going from almost waist-length to neck-length and buzz cut pre-chemo, then bald during treatment and it taking forever to grow back PFC, well, shower timings have all been wacked a long time. But my last couple showers including tonight's were reminiscent of pre-chemo showers because while the conditioner sat in my hair, I shaved my underarms...these little pieces of my cleanliness ritual had been messed up for months -- like not having any hair on my head to condition, no underarm hair to shave while the conditioner worked its magic, that kind of thing..... My Pack Rat says I should stop wearing my wig by the time summer comes. I guess I'll have to see if Major Kira's hairstyle will look OK on me (doubtful) by late springtime, which is when I might HAVE enough hair on my head to get it styled like hers... well, we shall see if I'm brave enough to trade the physical discomfort of wearing the wig for the aesthetic discomfort of going topless in a hairstyle that's not \"me.\" I'd guess mid to end of Springtime by the time I decide to deal with that decision. I forget what it's like to just go out to take trash to the dumpster, run out and get the mail or haul my laundry basket to the basement wihout having to put my wig on first..... and when I see neighbors leaving their apts I'm always envious, thinking \"Must be nice to just be able to go out and do what you need to do with your OWN hair on your head!\" LOL ~Lena. ",

Ewwww, I am so sick to death of the hot flashes. I fhought going off the Tamoxifen would have stopped them, but noooo......I get 'em both day and night, STILL.  >:-P GRRRRR! This hasn't been a good week for me though. I got taken off the Tamoxifen because of a blood clot, well, every day starting last Tuesday I've had to go get Lovenox injections! Yes, every single day, including over the weekend. Tomorrow is the last one (er, well, hopefully: I originally thought YESTERDAY's would be the last but my oncologist changed the order to add shots for today and tomorrow, plus an extra blood test on Friday). Weekdays I get the shots at the cancer center -- which was closed over the weekend so I had to get the Sat and Sun shots at the hospital. THEY HURT WORSE THAN NEULASTA! Neulasta shots only hurt me WHILE they were being administered, but once the nurse finished giving me the Neulasta shot, I was fine right away. Well this Lovenox crap hurts MORE than Neulasta when I get it (in the STOMACH -- I tried one Neulasta shot in the stomach, hurt like hell so I said \"in the arm\" for the rest of them: still hurt but not AS bad as in the stomach). I don't have the option to get the Lovenox shots in the arm -- believe me I asked! -- they say I can ONLY get them in the stomach, and on top of it hurting while I get it, it hurts for half an hour AFTER! I never thought I'd \"miss\" Neulasta shots, but here it is -- I'd rather get Neulasta shots than this f***ing Lovenox crap! Here's a scary thought -- what horror is next in this stupid cancer \"journey\" which will make me look back with nostalgia on Lovenox injections?  :::::shudder::::: ~Lena. ",

I wore him out, yes, but I ended up just as wiped out as him, heh heh heh ;-) . . . ended up going to bed real early last night -- guess I had to sleep it off big time. Too bad I can't sleep through a whole night without getting up to pee or from a hot flash or something though. >:-P Amy -- with that business of getting medical calls on a Friday like that: sounds to me like you really need to get rid of the cell phone. A regular telephone in your house, with an answering machine, is good enough! If it's important, the caller will leave a message. Yeah, you guessed it, I hate cell phones, and no, I don't have one. Helen -- I'm glad it's working for you (pun intended) but I think having to get a job would overwhelm and stress me out to the point of suicidal.  While my chemo brain did get somewhat better, I have NOT made a FULL cognitive recovery and the idea of having to learn a lot of new things and be GOOD at them on a consistent and likely multitasking (HORRORS) basis just totally scares the crap out of me. Maybe at some point I MIGHT be able to get a PART TIME job which doesn't require a lot of smarts, but I seriously doubt I could handle full time again.  About the hair -- I haven't had a haircut either. The complaint I have about my hair is that it's TOO SHORT, so why the hell would I CUT it?! -- and since your hair issue is similar to mine (not enough hair!), well, I can't see how a haircut wouldn't help you either! Geri -- (and anyone else who isn't a Stage IV) -- IMO stay away from the aromatase inhibitors, unless you WANT to be fat, depressed and lethargic with aching joints. Right now I'm staring at this little bottle of Aromasin, which I'm supposed to start tonight, and I can't tell you how badly I'm dreading it. I don't REALLY think it's going to be any better than the Femara, but being a Stage IV I'm kind of stuck being forced to try it at least, to be a lab rat like this. If I had been Stage I-III and my other treatments had gotten rid of all signs of the cancer, I wouldn't go anywhere near AIs. Betsy -- Sorry about your uncle's passing  (and your mother's illness)...and yeah, interesting observation, seeing most of the rest of your family when someone dies......  Judy --  hope the heartburn gets better! I'm still too tired (heh heh heh) to tell any stories, but I think I still have a laugh for you all anyway, since we all seem to be too fat.

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2010 07:15PM - edited Jun 9, 2010 07:17PM by Lena Hiya again.  It's my birthday today and all I can think is how I wish I had never been born. Why do people celebrate birthdays anyway? (Never mind, don't answer, it's just a rhetorical question...) Um well, OK, moving right along... Geri, I'm so sorry to hear about your friend Bonnie being diagnosed with lung cancer. :-( Judy -- what's going on in your world? You keep replying to the rest of us but don't say anything about you -- or am I just still chemo-brained and not noticing? Helen -- I hope you're feeling OK. {{{{{Helen}}}}} Meredith -- hi there, sure it's OK if you're here, but you'd probably relate more with the April 2010 chemo group. I did AC, but my T was taxotere, not taxol, and I did it WITH the AC. Someone on the Stage IV board calls it \"taxoterrible\" and I have to agree. No worries about kids or fertility for me either -- I hate kids and got spayed years ago (15 years before breast cancer) to make sure I wouldn't have any -- by far and away, that was the smartest decision I ever made in my entire life! Titan -- glad the storms didn't get you! Chelev and Betsy: I would LOVE to go back on Tamoxifen, certainly compared to this aromatase inhibitor crap. I WAS on Tamoxifen with ALMOST no SEs from 7.30.09 (the week after my last chemo) until February of this year. However, the SE I got was that deep vein thrombosis in my splenic portal vein, and THAT's why my oncologist took me off the Tamoxifen, ordered me to get all those horrible Lovenox injections/transitioned me onto Coumadin, which I'm STILL taking because my platelets are STILL too low (meaning, I still have the clot even though I stopped Tamoxifen and have been treated/am still taking medication for it. I have my next series of scans next week (PET, CT and Bone) so it'll be interesting to find out how the clot situation reads from THERE.. So since the chemotherapy pushed me the rest of the way into menopause (it's official, I'm now postmenopausal: my last period was 4.22.09) and I can't take Tamoxifen because of the clot issue, that's why my oncologist put me on AIs. Now if I wasn't a Stage IV and hormonal treatment was simply a matter of reducing the risk of RECURRENCE if I took it, I would have said no I'm not going anywhere near that stuff (AIs anyway: Tamox didn't initially scare me like AIs did/do, so THAT I'd have at least agreed to try anyway), based on my nasty reaction to birth control pills when I was younger. But not only is my cancer not all gone, I'm nowhere near remission -- even though it's much smaller, I do still have a palpable tumor in my right breast, and the bone met too. Which means I have to take this crap to control my cancer. BUT...(ooh, my Pack Rat just called me, squeeeeek!) ... we were talking the other day (he actually called me from work in the middle of the day on Monday!) and now tonight too and with our respective web researches, think we \"hit on it\" so I gotta call the psychiatrist and schedule an appointment with him to discuss it. My problem being dopamine deficiency brought on by first the chemo killing my estrogen, then the anti-cancer hormonal therapy killing my estrogen -- my entire list of physical, emotional and cognitive complaints/side effects is also on the list of dopamine deficiency symptoms, and estrogen deprivation messes up dopamine! So maybe there's a way I can up my dopamine to compensate and still be able to take the AIs to control my cancer. So I'll give the shrink a call tomorrow when I get back from having the car inspected. Oh, one more thing....2 pounds down, 28 to go. Too bad by the time I lose 'em and would look decent again, I'll have to be all bundled up for freezing weather! ~Lena.",

Think I used up what little brain power I had finishing up my contemporary modern apartment set (Sims hacks I actually started a month BEFORE chemo but had problems with them)....I had to let a lot of downloadaholics down in Jan 2009 when I told them then that I couldn't figure out what was wrong with them and wouldn't release them since they failed my quality control tests...shortly after that came my diagnosis (which I didn't and still don't discuss openly on my Sims forums...my fellow Simmers know I'm \"ill\" and have \"serious health issues\" but only my 4 closest \"sim sisters\" including my hacking mentor actually know what I have)...but anyway..well last weekend between scans I retested them and discovered the situation was not nearly as dire as it seemed. Out of 40 objects I only had 5 failures (which means I could have released the 35 good ones back then hahaha), and they were functional fails, not game crashing fails, and, dunno why I didn't think of this in Jan 2009 originally but this time I said \"OK, just do graphics swaps!\" -- and THAT fixed all five of the failures. Then I spent several hours making up the \"release package\" to send to the webmistress of the site which hosts my clandestine creations. When she gets a chance to upload them on the site, they'll be \"out there\" for all the downloadaholics. Finally, good, somehow I got 'em done because truth be told, after my diagnosis I was wondering if I'd ever finish them and be able to share them before I die. OK, apartment sets done, replicator -- an official real live non-clandestine project -- still to go. I've looked at it but I'm getting flummoxed reading the code and getting distracted. This one I gotta do mostly for me, though, because I can't set up a 23rd century modern theme game without a food replicator! But it's also supposed to be the base for Aponee's 24th century model, so I'm partly doing it for her too (we had an exchange: she's an artist, I\"m a hacker, so we're collaborating: she did all the artwork and I'm doing all the hacking, then when I finally finish it I have a perfect 23rd century Federation standard food replicator for my new hood, and she gets a 24th century model for her game, and the downloadaholics can download both from her website). I know, I'm rambling about what is to you crapola you have no idea what I'm talking about but somehow, like I said, my brain isn't working too well these days; outside of occasional short bursts I'm mostly nonfunctional, almost as bad as chemo.  Oh wait, my CURRENT (as in right this minute) problem might be the oxycodone too. Lemme see if I can try to steer this around without too much more circumlocution... Hmmmmm... OK, where did I leave off... The \"Dopamine Thing.\"  Yes, we're on to something with that; both the psychiatrist and even my oncologist thinks it makes sense at least, and I have by now some actual lab ratting which is \"encouraging.\" Dopamine (Google it, and Google \"dopamine and estrogen deprivation if you're really interested) is an important neurotransmitter, and estrogen deprivation kills brain cells which produce it. Since I can neither take estrogen nor even really stop taking my Aromasin (which turned out to be every bit as bad as the Femara in terms of SEs; three weeks on it and I was back being the exact same mess I'd been while on Femara) unless I want to die real soon, the theory we (Pack Rat and me) have, since all my AI SE complaints (joint pain, depression, mood swings, cognitive deficits) are also on the list of symptoms of dopamine deficiency, is that I get some dopamine from a source OTHER than estrogen. I emailed the articles to the psychiatrist, and he called me back and said it made sense to HIM and I should make an appointment with him and we'll discuss it in detail. The appointment is for next Thursday (July 1st). Today I had an appointment with my oncologist and I told him about the theory, gave him the printouts of the scientific articles I had, and also told him about my Lab Ratting which is corroborating the theory: A week ago I started taking a supplement called SAMe (pronounced \"Sammy\"). SAMe, which is short for S-adenosylmethionine (pronounced \"S-aDEN-oh-SILL-meth-EYE-oh-neen), is a substance which the body makes naturally from the amino acid methionine, which the body uses to make dopamine. I began by taking 2 400-mg horse pills of the stuff per day (recommended dosage is 1-3 pills per day). I took that for one week, and, while I'm definitely still messed up (I'm still taking the Aromasin, after all), the SAMe IS taking the edge off ever so slightly: I'm still depressed and moody but the several times a day crying jags and thoughts of suicide/wanting to die stopped. Also, my feet and hips stopped hurting, and SOME of the knee pain went away too. I noticed the difference almost immediately too, and for my last week before seeing the psychiatrist, I decided to try upping my SAMe dosage to 3 pills a day. This I started today. I don't know if it'll make a difference/how much of one if it does yet, but the study I read had shown 1600 mg per day to be effective against depression, so going from my current 800 to 1200 mg per day won't hurt. I'd try the 1600 mg per day, except the stuff is expensive ($36.00 plus tax for a box of 30 400 mg pills), and supplements aren't covered by Medicaid. Still though if dopamine really can fix my SEs, I know there's prescription dopamine to be had, which my Medicaid WILL cover, and is where the psychiatrist, who can also figure out a better dosing scheme I'm sure, comes in. I just want to hear the \"juicy details\" of what he has to say about the research I sent him, and tell him about how taking the SAMe did help a little bit too. Ohgarsh, what next...you're probably wondering why I need to take oxycodone, right? Well I wish I could say exactly, but I don't know what it is or how it happened. It FEELS like I badly sprained or twisted or tore something in my right leg, in the knee area, except I didn't fall down or bang into something and I have no recollection of twisting or pulling or spraining! I have no idea of exactly how or when it happened, only, as I told my oncologist today, a vague \"It started hurting late Wednesday afternoon or early that evening, and when I got up Thursday morning it was excruciating to the point where I can only barely walk, well limp is more like it.\" The Wednesday and Thursday I refer to were LAST WEEK. So yes, I've been almost a complete invalid for the past week -- I can't really walk, I have to limp, and the stairs are excruciating and fearsome (I live in an upstairs apartment in a building with no elevators: to go out somewhere or come home, it's 3 flights of stairs; to get from my apt to the basement laundry room, it's 4 flights). Unless it's absolutely necessary I can't leave the apartment anymore, and certain things are coming up critical because I can't do them like this (more to come)...Now seeing how I take Coumadin for my clot, I'm not supposed to take NSAIDs (like Advil, my former painkiller of choice) without a doctor's permission due to bleeding risk, so at first I tried extra strength Tylenol, and then an 8 hour acetaminophen --  to no avail. On Tuesday I couldn't stand the pain anymore, plus, since my Aromasin was about to run out, I called my oncologist's office to tell him I needed a refill if he wanted me to keep taking it, plus I also asked if I could please try Advil for my hurting leg since acetaminophen wasn't helping.  Got the Aromasin called in and the pharmacy delivered it, and permission to take Advil (which I already had). Nope, the Advil didn't help either, so today during our appointment, my oncologist gave me a prescription for oxycodone and had me set up to get an MRI Saturday to hopefully find out what this IS (it's not a bone met: my most recent bone scan which I just had last weekend showed only my one known met to the iliac bone).  Still though it's scary.  Because I'm so afraid of the stairs now, and I can't walk anyway, I've had to can my \"exercise program\" (daily walking, which I'd been building on since April, from a round or two around the block to 2-4 miles per day in the park and/or running errands on foot). I didn't think it would bother me this much -- even though some days I called my walks \"death marches\" and even after a good one I usually felt like crap as soon as I got back home and sat down to relax -- they triggered really nasty hot flashes, the kind with profuse sweating and itching -- but it does! I actually miss my walks. Worse, though: I need to clean my bathtub (it's getting slippery) and can't because I can't kneel in front of the tub to clean it out; I can't go grocery shopping, and I can't do the laundry, I had my CT and bone scans hobbling, had to be helped on and off the table like a decrepit old person; same for my PET scan. Anyway the oxycodone now seems to help the pain a little (better than the OTC stuff did anyway) but I still can't do anything.   ......oh wow. I started this post yesterday (Thursday June 24th), now it's Friday June 25th. But, I already warned you all I'm a mess. OK but while I'm here sort of (I'm now fogheaded from the oxycodone too: it kept me asleep MOST of the night -- only got up once, but I'm \"hung over\" from it, and had take the morning dose to keep the agony at bay).....(oh geez what's this now, I'm nauseous and dizzy? Well fine then, losing my appetite is a good thing since i want to lose weight...but...ooooh...:::head spins::: , , , I better grab a compazine,  Good thing I didn't use all those up during chemo huh? So where do we leave off now....oh yeah, all that kids' weddings stuff.  Amy and Helen...All I can say is glad you're all happy with all of it and enjoying the conversations about it...but sorry, I don't know what to say myself; I have nothing to add because I have no frame of reference -- on top of not having kids, social occasions like that have always made me intensely uncomfortable. My idea of a romantic wedding was elopement:  the couple and a justice of the peace, no muss no fuss. So all I can say is \"different strokes for different folks,\" and I'm glad for you all to have something you enjoy. Chelev -- turns out the last day I was able to walk was the day I walked to the pharmacy to buy the SAMe, and I happened to notice on one of the (several) hairdressers' doors, Brazilian keratin, as well as the usual haircut, coloring and other styling services offered. Even though from having read your post about your Brazilian keratin treatment costing $65 I knew I wouldn't be able to afford to get one, I inquired how much it would cost anyway. It's MORE expensive HERE! The woman -- once they found someone who spoke some barely passable English -- told me $85-100! I don't have that kind of \"play money\" (there is no room in my budget for anything which doesn't feed, clothe or shelter me, or keep my car legal and computer up and running), so I have to tolerate the awful \"senile old lady who stuck her finger in the electric socket\" look until it grows out on its own. If I live that long anyway... Oh geez, it's only 10 AM and I need a NAP now?! Be back later, I know I'm so far behind but I just can't even sit up anymore...  ~Lena. ",

Titan -- what was that about you and your girl friends hiring a stripper?! LOL. On that note, kind of, I think my Pack Rat's next visit will begin on the evening of Friday July 9th. I love it when he strips.  ;-)  Oh, and I also don't talk about my cancer except to medical personnel, my friend Kym, my Pack Rat, and here at BCO. There are \"outsiders\" (my friends from other forums) who know I'm \"seriously ill\" but not in detail. Judy --  I know what you mean, noticing the \"messy house\" thing more now than this time last year. Believe it or not, I'm noticing it this year. Thing is though, I still can't do that sort of heavy work at all (even before my leg decided to give out on me), there's nobody here who \"could be doing more,\" and I can't afford to hire a cleaning service. I am, however, going to look into something I heard about from the ACS, \"Cleaning for a Cause\" where supposedly the ACS helps cancer patients who can't do heavy housework and have nobody to help them. If I could just get someone in here to do a big once-over on the heavy housework, and then come in once a month to maintain it (the floors and bathroom), it wouldn't be so bad. Except for now when my leg is messed up I can do the lighter, more regular stuff: I can wash dishes, take out the garbage and do the laundry, which I'm sure I'll be able to do when my leg heals. So if that's all I'd have to do, it would be OK. Geri -- That's great about almost being finished with the Herceptin, and, how's your friend Bonnie doing? Oh, and how did all those doctor visits go? Oh wow on the \"feel up\" business! Other than doctors/nurses/med techs, I wouldn't let anyone touch my port (no one has asked, thank goodness). I can't stand either the sight of it or touching it myself (when I take showers and am washing that area of my body), in fact. It's yucky, I hate it, it bothers me if I wear a bra or seat belt when I drive my car or try to carry my iBook bag over my shoulder, and now it requires maintenance too, it has to be flushed periodically. I wish I could have it out, but the doctor wants me to keep it.  :-P Alaina -- That's awful about your aunt's breast cancer, I'm so sorry. She must be glad to have YOU though, right? I guess you can sort of take her by the hand and let her know what to expect so she doesn't feel lost, alone and overwhelmed? Is she going to join BCO too? Betsy -- good going with the \"boring\" mammo. I bet you're relieved as all hell. No mammos or paps for me; getting chest, abdomen and pelvis CT and PET scanned 2-3 times a year now is enough as far as I'm concerned. I figure if the scans still register my right breast tumor and the bone met, they'll register it if I got cancer anyplace else too. But more on that momentarily. OK, so yesterday was Thursday, how did the blood test go? I had blood drawn yesterday too, as usual on days when I see the oncologist. As always, it hurt. I can't stand needles.  And now for the \"Fun Stuff\" -- what all happened during my oncologist visit yesterday, other than the business with my leg and the oxycodone (and my port being flushed)... 1. Blood work: my platelets are up -- still very low but better than last time, so my Coumadin regime stays the same (take 5 mg on even dates, 2.5 mg on odd dates) for now. The rest of my blood count is getting closer to normal too. My red blood cells and lymphocytes are still a little low, but I have considerably fewer of the other components out of whack like they had been. 2. Scan results: a. Bone scan was good; my known left iliac met showed no change and I have no new bone mets. b. CT scan; my nodes are all still clean of cancer, it also registers my iliac met as \"stable\" since the last scan, and in spite of the increase in my platelets from the blood work, I do still have the clot (\"splenic and portal vein chronic occlusions are demonstrated with collateral vessels demonstrated,\" to be exact).  c. PET scan: Uh-oh, I MIGHT have a lung met. Doc wants to keep an eye on this and scan again in September, unless I get symptoms, in which case we act sooner. Note, I haven't had any problems breathing other than what for me is usual windedness if I exert myself (and with some of the AI hot flashes which for me feel very different than the ones I had on chemo and Tamox). He says that since there was no evidence in the CT scan of a lung met to corroborate with the PET, it's just a \"maybe\" and 3 months to next scan won't make any difference in my prognosis or treatment if I do have one. I'm not telling Kym or my Pack Rat about it, I just don't wanna unless I have to. Have a good weekend, all....  ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Jul 8, 2010 02:44PM Lena wrote: Hiya all. Helen -- I'm sorry for that comment about telling you to stop taking Arimidex. I guess it's just because I'm so mad at the AIs being almost as bad as chemo for ME, and watching you in here being just as depressed as me for about the same amount of time -- and although I'm more stable at the moment, I'm still a bit emotionally volatile in general (though today so far hasn't been as bad...which is maybe why I'm posting instead of just reading today). But yes, you're right, if you've had issues since BEFORE the Arimidex, then the medication is not to blame. I was all right (other than the hair issue) and starting to recover from the chemo UNTIL I went on the goddamn AIs. I'd say I'll promise to behave myself and not get overemotional but it may be too soon to make promises like that. (Gosh. Once upon a time, late 80s to early 90s, when I used to do live action Star Trek roleplaying, my persona was Vulcan and I was repeatedly told by my \"captain\" how I astonished the entire East Coast convention circuit with how \"realistic\" I was (oooh, maybe someday, the story of how I showed up in college psychology class in full Vulcan regalia wearing my Starfleet uniform)! Who would know now..oh yes, now I know what happened. Even though she wasn't in her 200s yet, T'Lena got Bendii Syndrome, primary indication of which is loss of emotional control)........... Fine then I'm just going to ramble like an idiot and make little or no sense to any of you, kind of like when I get going with my little simmies or how I'm making stuff for them. Oh someone had questions about sims...was that you Amy? I'd be happy to give you simmie lessons. As long as the questions are about the original game (NOT Sims 2 or Sims 3), I can probably tell you anything you wanna know (I know a TINY bit about Sims 2 and 3 but not much) and if I can't, I can easily direct you to places in the online Sims community which can.. PM me and I'll give you my email address (oh hell, you can ALL have my email address if you wanna PM me for it). Oh, and didn't Titan have a question about my iliac met? What did you want to ask? Geri -- the oncologist didn't give me the Wellbutrin, the psychiatrist did. I did call the psychiatrist today to tell him how I was doing on the Wellbutrin and the Lunesta, which he put me on at the same time (a week ago today). This included telling him about that horrid 3 day Attack of the Broken Brain but also how I read online (yesterday) that I'm not the only Wellbutrin user who had a SE like that in the beginning -- so yes it happens to some patients, and yes it goes away -- looks like I was in that category. Other than the temporary Attack of the Broken Brain I haven't been having any other nasty SEs, so he upped my dosage from 150 mg/day to 300 mg/day. So today I took 300 mg, will keep taking that and \"watch.\"  As to the Lunesta -- I guess there really ISN'T anything (short of addictive barbiturates, the old fashioned sleeping pills doctors don't prescribe anymore?) that will keep me asleep ALL NIGHT. The Lunesta is better than anything else I've tried (especially if I take one of my leftover Ativans with it), though, I only get up once, not 2-3 times. Of course maybe I could get lucky and this Wellbutrin fix the depression, and finally not need sleeping pills at all anymore? Oh, yes, I had to laugh at the irony of the fact that this is the same thing in the stop smoking medication Zyban. For me it's a humorous irony because I already DID quit smoking last fall, cold turkey; no NRT, no Zyban, no Chantix, no nothing except www.whyquit.com and another quit smoking forum. So here I am taking Wellbutrin but I don't need to stop smoking anymore. Judy -- Yeah I know what you mean -- I used to be superorganized too. Had everything down to a science, and my ability to develop all these sciences was one of my major prides and joys. Now I'm like my Pack Rat who has no connection to the spacetime continuum as we know it.  Ummm next...There is a very, ahhh...how do I say this...a subtle difference between actually feeling or being unlovable and the kind of unlovable Helen is describing. I actually THINK I can articulate it precisely: yes, your family and friends may love you, and for THAT kind of love it really and truly does not matter what you look like; hair or no hair, short hair or long, blonde, brunette, redhead or grey, good breasts, mangled breasts or no breasts, skinny, \"just right\" or overweight -- none of that matters because THIS kind of lovable is what's on the INSIDE, which consists of but is not limited to such qualities as intelligence, kindness or loyalty. The kind of \"lovable\" which is dependent on physical beauty (which both Helen and I are screaming upset about having lost that) means SEXUALLY AND ROMANTICALLY ATTRACTIVE, the kind that's gonna get a guy's attention so he can even FIND OUT about the inner qualities which are lovable, and let's face it, you know how men are. Even if you have a man who both proclaims and acts as though he loves you and you feel secure in your relationship, he's still gonna LOOK at gorgeous women who have beautiful faces, beautiful hair and beautiful bodies (which happen to not be overweight or missing any breasts). That is biologically hardwired in males, and that's what they'll chase after first. Now the problem with this is that somehow, \"sexually and romantically attractive\" are, definitely for me and probably for Helen (so I get the impression anyway: she'll correct me if I'm wrong), the MOST important, MOST powerful kind of love -- is romantic sexual love -- and if we don't feel THAT kind of attractive (and why would we with all these hair problems and mutilated bodies?!), we consider ourselves \"unlovable\" -- totally forgetting the inner qualities why our friends love us and even though deep down we know they love us, that's just \"not enough.\" Kind of on that subject, I still honestly don't know how I manage to keep that Pack Rat with my ugly short hair, tubby body with a mangled breast and an approaching expiration date on top of it all, but he's venturing back to my Sewer Rat Nest tomorrow night. Should be interesting, it's been all kinds of hot and hideous here. Yup I have an AC for the bedroom and the living room. But oh my has it ever been hot and hideous here. We had a power failure (I was apparently not the only person blasting an AC -- it was 104 degrees F (40 C for you, Helen) and the heat index was 117 (47.2 C) but when the power came back, the bedroom AC didn't! Oh yeah and this is an upstairs apartment, remember, and heat rises? Talk about sweltering! Well I updated my backups of both the Mini and the Quicksilver (dying in here!) and then was getting the iBook loaded up because I was gonna camp out in the living room since THAT AC still worked....barely; it's not big enough to cool the whole living room, only enough to take a slight edge off the heat but way better than sweltering in the bedroom... So I'm getting ready to \"move\" to the living room and my Pack Rat calls and not only am I telling him about how hot it's been here (100s for several consecutive days) and how I'm \"really effed now without the bedroom AC\" when he asks me if the power strip it's plugged into has an indicator light. It's on the floor behind the bed so I have to pick it up and look. While picking it up and looking I see no light, but there is a switchy thingie (listen to that, 'switchy thingie' I call it, geez wouldja ever guess my Pack Rat is a mechanical designer/inventor?!). I press the switchy thingie and hear a  \"BEEP!\" I tell my Pack Rat this and he says to try to turn on the AC now. It worked!  (whew!!!!) Well anyway so among other things we talk about him coming down this weekend and instead of the usual \"gonna lock the doors and wear you out so you never escape\" business I said I wanted to run away from home and was thinking of escaping with him when he leaves on Sunday afternoon to return to his Nest in the North. Dunno if I actually will do that or not but I'm tempted as all hell, I'm so sick of \"same shit different day\" and I figure for once I don't have any doctor appointments next week plus it's also his work-from-home week so maybe....well we'll see.  In the meantime, I went food shopping. I only bought stuff for Weekend Pack Rat Spoilage (no extras like I usually do...in the event I run away from home for a week). I'm going to make the Italian sausage, potatoes, onions and peppers recipe again, plus, dunno how we went on for 7 years without me ever making my Infamous English Muffin Pizzas for him, but I've never made it for him...YET. I will this weekend; I bought all the stuff. Well OK, gotta go for now. As much as you can: feel good and have fun. ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Jul 14, 2010 09:48AM - edited Jul 14, 2010 09:56AM by Lena Hahahahaha! Ladies, please don't confuse anxious-overwhelmed-panicked \"mania\" with optimism, enthusiasm and being a \"new woman.\" I haven't moved in 25 years so I'm scared anyway with \"what do I do\" since it's been so long I don't remember, PLUS, unlike that last time (when I moved into THIS apartment), I now have disability and terminal illness issues to deal with, and I am royally freaking out! I haven't heard from the social worker at Norris Cotton Cancer Center I left the message with on Monday, and couldn't get an email address for him (my Pack Rat had suggested someone at Dartmouth, like that social worker, could help me navigate through this. Oh geez i WISH!). Well in the meanwhile, while I'm waiting, I start looking up things on the Medicaid front, and that's scaring the living shit out of me. Just because I was eligible for and receive NJ Medicaid does not mean that I'll qualify for NH Medicaid -- I'm gonna have to apply for it THERE and can't do it until I'm a RESIDENT of NH, and it takes 45 days for them to decide if you're eligible/get it -- and I still have to find out if NJ Medicaid will \"shut off\" when they find out I applied for NH Medicaid, thereby leaving me with a gap in coverage (so I cannot afford to even stay on my meds) or totally losing coverage \"forever\" (i.e., NH Medicaid denies my application).  The other complication is the fact that I have a lease on this apartment and I'm trapped here until it runs out, so it's not like I can move up to NH NOW and get the process going up there...and I don't have a few thousand extra bucks on me to rent an apt up there/begin setting up \"new house\" now while still paying rent here until the lease is up. I am just totally overwhelmed and it's making me very hyper and anxious.  That said... um hmmmmm it's only ALMOST 11 AM...I hope Geri is about to get her last Herceptin. Oh and Amy, you live in MD and you actually consider NJ acceptable driving distance to \"whip me into shape\" or get a Sims lesson?! Are you KIDDING? It's been between 1-2 decades since I drove to MD (Towson and Baltimore for music stuff and Star Trek conventions, respectively), but I recall it taking about 4 hours to get there (same for the return trip). Which was OK (once or twice a year) to spend a weekend, but not a day trip! Well -- if I had better air conditioning in my apartment, and if you really were actually willing to drive here, I'd PM you with my email addy and phone number and say let's try to arrange it (Geri too, she actually DOES live in what I'd consider a semi-reasonable distance: oh Geri no, you don't have to BLINDFOLD yourself, all you have to do is, if you have one, leave your camera at home!). But the problem is, my living room AC doesn't cool the whole living room so you'd probably be miserable. When it's this hot and humid, I pretty much stay holed up in the bedroom (it's smaller, so the AC does cool the room), only going \"out\" to use the bathroom and eat. Which is fine for me, but I'm unsure at best about inviting \"new people\" here (the only guests I've had in over a decade have been Kym and her husband, and my Pack Rat, and they \"know,\" if you know what I mean).  I just don't know if you'd be willing to BRAVE it, and to drive up here for nothing, well forget it. Maybe if it cools down in September and if we all have time? About weight loss measurement in terms of getting on a scale vs. \"how the clothes fit\" -- until THIS YEAR (middle of May, to be precise), I didn't even HAVE a scale. I always went by how my clothes fit/how I looked in the mirror,  But (back then) I wasn't trying to lose weight either, even though I estimated by clothes and appearance that I really should lose 10 pounds (this was before the breast cancer). When I FIRST got the breast cancer and was weighed/got the actual number for the first time in years -- yup, I was right on, at 135 pounds I was indeed carrying 10 extra pounds. I never LIKED being 10 pounds overweight, but it didn't bother me enough to get into a diet and exercise campaign -- I just dressed to hide it! LOL. But once I was diagnosed and going to the oncologist and being treated for my breast cancer, well, every single time I showed up for either a doctor visit or chemo infusion, the first thing they did was put me on a frickin scale! OK, I was able to live with it and not get TOO depressed (about my WEIGHT, anyway!) during chemo and my first couple months PFC on Tamoxifen, since I was holding steady in that 135 range, but once I quit smoking and soon thereafter was put on AIs, well yes I noticed I was blowing up like a balloon in \"the old way\" since I didn't have my own scale yet  -- OF COURSE I could FEEL my clothes getting tighter and tighter and before too long, many of them not fitting at all! I haven't dared to even TRY to squeeze back into the jeans I used to wear this time last year in months -- I \"outgrew\" them around February -- and I saw in my own mirror how I looked (terrible!), but being put on that goddamn scale every doctor visit and seeing those unprecedented (for me) big numbers -- somehow I decided my \"old ways\" were not going to work anymore and I couldn't avoid a scale unless I just stop going to the doctor LOL...and while I was able to tolerate being 10 pounds overweight, 30 pounds overweight was UNACCEPTABLE to me. So for me having my own scale now and a diet plan for which I weigh in every morning (and calculate a trendline based on the number I get on the scale) feels like my way of saying \"F-YOU\" to the doctor for \"making me\" fat (he put me on that frickin medication!) and forcing me to get on a scale at a time I really didn't want to, which to me felt like \"rubbing it in my face,\" and now while I'm at it, if I'm going to trouble myself to diet at all, why not set the goal to 125 and be rid of the original 10 pounds overweight too? Exercise -- hiring a trainer and/or joining a gym is not an option for me (no money for that, and I don't want to drive to a gym anyway), and walking is the only exercise I can do, between my stroke paralysis and joint stiffness from the AIs: all exercises with instructions that begin with \"Lie down on the floor or a mat on the floor\" are OUT because I have bad balance and it hurts too much to get down or up from anything lower than a chair). Still, though, walking is still exercise, and I figure it's gotta be much better than sitting on my lazy butt all day. I got committed to walking this spring once the weather warmed up enough to spend time outside. I worked my way up from a daily walk around the block to a daily walk with a range of 2-4 miles per day. To that end I was doing a combination of running errands on foot and walking in the park: if on any given day, I had no errands or only a \"close\" one, I'd walk in the park till I had a minimum of 2 miles -- if I wanted to go to the supermarket, a 4 mile round trip (plus dragging and hauling groceries), I'd go on foot but not have to do any MORE walking that day, I got a pedometer so I know how much I was walking -- and if I hadn't hurt my leg a few weeks ago I'd have kept it up. This is the first week my leg is totally pain free, so it's also my last week of sitting on my butt not doing anything I don't actually have to do, I want to make sure it's healed enough. Next Monday I plan to resume walking, and I'll start all over with walking around the block and building up to 2+ miles per day. I'm hoping that resuming my walks will help me with my diet, too. Helen, FYI, I used this plan (The Hacker's Diet) to design my OWN diet. This way I still get to eat all the foods I like -- just in lesser quantity is all. If only I'd known about this years ago (it was around then, I just never encountered it), I would have actually troubled myself to lose weight back when I was only 10 pounds overweight! I suggest it to you now because  in addition to how well I think it's working for me (there is no other diet I could even CONSIDER without becoming seriously depressed!), and since you have more weight you want to lose than I've got, I'm thinking perhaps if you don't have to eat foods you don't like or stay totally away from foods you do like, would make it easier for you. I know even my 30 extra pounds (um, well actually 23 now; as of today I'm down 7 from my starting point) was less than your 66, but to me it still felt like an eternity at my starting point May 24th when I was thinking OMG only a pound per week, I'll have to be doing this counting calories crap until December to lose my 30 pounds! But most importantly, the guy who wrote this Hacker's Diet was fat himself -- 70 pounds overweight, and he designed this plan/lost the 70 pounds in less than a year on it (he apparently had more tolerance for \"pain\" than I do, but OK, even though I'm losing slower than he did, I AM still LOSING!). I wish I could do the exercise plan it includes as an option in the \"What, Me Exercise?\" chapter, but like I said, walking is really all I can handle, so I'm walking instead of doing this guy's recommended exercises (BTW, you don't HAVE TO exercise to lose weight: as long as you eat fewer calories than you burn, you'll lose weight, but this does NOT mean it's healthy to avoid exercise either). Maybe you'll find it okay for you, though. But the explanation on how weight loss and weight control work, and that it shows you exactly how a dieter can design his or her OWN food plan -- is indispensible. You do need a scale, though. LOL. Copy this linkie into your browser and download The Hacker's Diet (it's also a FUN read, too!): www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/...  OK gotta go! ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2010 02:29PM - edited Jul 15, 2010 02:36PM by Lena GERI!!!!! {{{{{{{{{{GERI}}}}}}}}}}} Congratulations and Praise Ratness! ALL DONE!!!! WOO-HOO!!!!!!!! I hope you drank your Herceptini in one of the glasses you got as a present from your chemo nurse. That was so cool! Did you do a cartwheel? Oh, and if you get your filthy car to my street or thereabouts on a day of 80 degrees or higher with a sky opening flash flooding pounding DOWNPOUR like the ones I washed my own cars in, I'll be happy to wash it for you... Titan -- Of course you don't have to lie to us if you're blue....hey, do you think looking at those old pictures might have kicked you into some kind of Melancholy Mourning Mode? I ask because there are certain things I've been trying to avoid because they set me off like that -- they remind me of how it was before BC, and the person I used to be. If I'm home by myself when it happens, it's OK and I'll let myself cry, but it's bad when I'm out because sometimes things catch me by surprise and I get \"triggered\" and have to hold it in till I get home. Now to answer the question about just crawling into my Pack Rat's Nest in the North-- it literally IS a pack rat nest and the chaos is such that I haven't even been able to do a weekend thing since October because he has to make room for me and excavate the bed! Visiting him -- even when he \"cleans up for me\" -- is usually best described as going on a camping trip in a combination hardware store/auto mechanic garage/computer repair shop during Inventory Week. I'm telling you, I call him my Pack Rat because he really IS one! There ought to be a picture of him as the sole definition of the word Chaos. So, while maybe we MIGHT end up living together at some point, and I'm sure he wouldn't toss me out on the street if I had nowhere to go, it's really a better idea if I can rent an apartment of my own -- for both our sakes. Nope, I don't mind this; while I never LIKED the fact of the LONG DISTANCE aspect of our relationship, the idea of us having our own places I do like -- even though I no longer want to be TOTALLY alone, there are also things I really love about living by myself too (and I think he does as well). I would just prefer it if I lived 20 minutes (give or take) from him instead of 6-8 HOURS from him if you know what I mean -- so that's why I gotta move up there to accomplish this. And I know, I probably don't make a lot of sense...but OK...and yes, I hate that I got chubby too...which is why I went on a diet! LOL! Judy -- hear, hear! My hair is also still way too short for my liking, but I actually noticed some growth yesterday! (I try not to watch it too carefully because even before chemo, it always grew slowly so I know I'll get depressed if I look at it carefully day after day and not notice any growth). In the back, some of it touches the top of my neck now. I call its current state (as of the last couple of weeks actually) the \"electric socket stage\" because not only does it look like I stuck my finger in an electric socket, but (at least for the time being) I have to CULTIVATE that look by deliberately mussing it up wild after I comb it! When my hair was pre-chemo long, it was \"slightly wavy,\" but now that I don't have the weight of almost waist-length pulling down on it to mostly straighten it so it's only a LITTLE wavy, it's EXTREMELY wavy! :-O And if I don't muss it, it's very close to my head and IMO makes me look like an old lady. So I muss it up. That makes me look like I stuck my finger in the electric socket (hence my name for this stage of my hair regrowth), but a little less old ladyish. Anyway...I'm glad I can resist chocolate -- easily! The only times I found chocolate irresistible were sometimes when I was having my period. Now that I don't menstruate anymore, I don't get ANY hankerings for chocolate! Oh, and when/where will you be going on vacation? Amy -- Like I said, don't mistake nervous anxiety for positive energy, although something MAY actually go RIGHT for a change (more momentarily). Well, anyway, I never in my life thought I'd actually think exercise was cool or understand why anyone would do it or could enjoy it, but I loved reading about you talking about your workouts and how you stick with them, and that makes me start to look forward to resuming my walking on Monday and remembering how proud of myself I was getting for going for a walk every single day and working myself up to 2+ miles per day (until my right leg/knee area mysteriously gave out on me). But yeah, if you're having pain and soreness, maybe a LITTLE resting it would do some good (ask your trainer about it: I bet he's versed enough about sports/exercise injuries) because if you injure yourself, I can assure you, you are REALLY gonna be hurting! This is the first week in almost a month that my leg is pain free, and I was housebound for pushing two weeks because it hurt so bad and I was afraid of falling down the stairs because I couldn't walk properly because of severe pain. Which is also why, even though NOW the pain is all gone and I think my leg was finally healed as of this past weekend, I decided to give it one week just to \"make sure\" it's OK -- so that's why this is my last \"sit on my ass\" week and I start my walking again on Monday. Helen -- Forgive me if I'm asking an ignoramus question, but how come going for a business lunch means you have to eat fattening stuff? True, you can't actually count calories in most restaurant food, but, well, don't you like salad, and don't most restaurants have salad? I call myself an ignoramus on this because not only do I not know your food preferences, but I've never been on a business lunch and don't know the etiquette. On extremely rare occasions I'd go out for lunch with coworkers but those were informal work-buddy things and someone in the department's birthday so we took him/her out to lunch things... Anyway -- never mind, what's done is done, if you \"blew it\" today you can start fresh tomorrow. Betsy -- How's living out of the utility room going? Oh, is the term \"utility room\" synonymous with \"basement\" or \"cellar\"? If not, you'll have to describe a utility room for me. LOL I know, I'm so socially retarded! And yes, add me to your list of people with sleep issues since chemo. For the time being, I'm taking 1.5 mg of melatonin and a 3 mg Lunesta tablet just before bedtime (I like anything between 10:30 and midnight as a bedtime, and consider 7-8 AM a good wakeup time), and it's MOSTLY working. This is to say that I only wake up ONCE in the middle of the night, not 2, 3 or 4 times like before; that, or occasionally now I actually do sleep through the night, but I wake up for the day too early (like between 5:30-6 AM). CHELEV -- Where are you? How are you? OK now I breathe a MAJOR sigh of relief!!! WHEWWWW!!!! After the past four days spending anywhere from 1-4 hours a day making myself nuts trying to figure out the starting point of the medical transition (i.e., Medicaid issues, how to become a patient at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center) while I have this combination of residual chemo brain, Aromasin fog and clinical depression screwing up my ability to think straight, it turns out: I had TOTALLY FORGOTTEN about MEDICARE -- I mistakenly thought I wasn't going to be eligible for it until I had been receiving SS Disabilty for TWO years, not ONE!!!! That's why I thought I'd have to get NH Medicaid if I left NJ, since I've only been receiving the disability checks for one year, not two. (Eeeeesh!) Soooo: My MEDICARE coverage (since I'm on SS Disability) is going to kick in just in the nick of time! It goes into effect on 11/1/10! (Theoretically, that would be the day I move into my NH apartment.) I got the Medicare card in the mail yesterday, but spent all morning making myself crazy because I couldn't figure out where or how I'd get prescription drug coverage (I saw I had hospitalization and doctor's office -- Medicare parts A and B, on my card, but no part D for the prescription plan, so I was afraid of not being able to afford medication). Well in the midst of this morning's mad researching trying to figure out the Medicare Advantage Plans, I had also called and left messages with \"my\" social worker at my present cancer center, plus someone at Dartmouth. All I have to do now is relax for awhile and: 1. Just WAIT for MEDICARE to send me all the information on Part D, plus, 2. Ask my oncologist to call in or fax a REFERRAL to the Norris Cotton Cancer Center's Comprehensive Breast Program. My next appoinment with my oncologist is next Thursday. I'll be able to have a joke with him that he can be rid of me at last, if he'll only just \"call this number, please.\" LOL So now I shall go turn my attention over to my simmies, and the upcoming Grand Purge. Be well, and catchya all next time. ~Lena.",

      "Content": "Jul 25, 2010 07:39AM - edited Jul 25, 2010 10:34AM by Lena Hey there all, Sorry I haven't written. I'm just feeling so emotionally detached from everything now is all. Like nothing's bad (except the neuropathy in my arms) but nothing's good either. Just hit 4th week on the antidepressant, I hate to think it may not work because this is the only one I'm willing to take -- all the others have sexual side effects which I just won't put up with. Well, I'll see what the psychiatrist says on Aug 5th when I see him. It's weird -- Kym and my Pack Rat have told me I sound so much better when they talk to me on the phone, but I still don't feel \"right.\" While I'm neither in a volatile emotional firestorm nor suicidal, I still feel sad/blue and have the attention span and mental focus of a gnat and NONE of my old creative sparks. I just don't get it. Betsy -- thanks for telling me what a utility room is, but now I have to admit I don't know exactly what you mean by \"assessment deadlines\" at your job -- but from the way you describe it I don't think I WANT to know, so I won't ask. It sounds horrible, like one of those things I don't understand how anyone could do. As to the South Beach Diet you mention, I don't know it, I'll have to ask my good buddy Google. And yeah, if you have portion size under control but not exercise, yeah, maybe it IS time for you to step up the exercise:  if you burn more than you eat, you should lose weight (eventually LOL). Last Monday, I started my walking again this week, but very slowly -- I went back to the beginning mostly with just walks around the block and two errands on foot; I'm not doing my walks in the park around the lake/2+ miles a day yet. I've walked every day so far except yesterday (it was so hot we had alerts and I considered it medically dangerous!). Today it was 80 degrees (26.7C) at SEVEN IN THE MORNING (it'll be in the 90s later, and tomorrow too) -- so I decided it might be my only chance to walk today and maybe even tomorrow too: so even though I hadn't had my coffee yet -- I did a 2-block circle of my apt building and then walked to the \"little store\" to buy a half gallon of milk. First thing I did when I got back (other than put the milk in the fridge) was push that button to start brewing the coffee! And go back to hiding out in the bedroom with the AC. Anyway -- I'm now down 9 pounds since I started my diet. 21 more to go! Oh, and I wish your weather would come pay me a visit for awhile! LOL Enjoy the family reunion, too. Titan -- Yeah, I'd be scared in your position too. Dunno what to tell you on that, though, except that I understand how you feel (other things than job being a priority, yet still needing the job: that's where I was mentally/emotionally until the economy ate my last job in May 2008). :-( Oh, but I do love steak (which I haven't eaten much of lately since it's so expensive) and green beans. Geri -- Glad you didn't get hungover from your Herceptinis, and congrats on the diet. I don't want to be overweight anymore either. If you can lose 2 pounds a week, you're a stronger person than me! I'm satisfied with a 1 pound per week loss; IF somehow by chance I lose more than a pound a week fine, but seeing how I can only eat 1100 (if I don't exercise) to 1300 or 1400 (if I do exercise) calories per day in order to lose that one pound a week, well, that's the least I can do without it being torture, and I'm not going to let it become torture. I mean, at MY BODY's rate of burn (1600 cals per day without exercise; 1700-1800 if I exercise), in order to lose 2 pounds a week I'd have to cut my eating down to only 600-800 calories per day, which would be both unhealthy AND torture! No thanks! I had a couple days this week (probably because of the heat) where I just wasn't hungry at a particular mealtime so I skipped a couple meals, only ate 800-something on those days, but that's not how I feel every day, so I plan my eating to allow for the 1100 calories per day, and most of the time I do eat everything I planned, and it isn't that much torture. The worst part of it is having to PLAN my meals ahead of time to make sure the calorie counts are correct. Helen -- Cooking for one (when it is NOT 90+F/32+C in the kitchen, that is), isn't bad at all. I like to eat \"real meals\" most of the time, so that means cooking them. Sometimes I cook enough to feed 3-4 people so I don't have to cook every single day but I can still eat a \"real meal.\" I'll make chicken/rice/veggies, tuna casserole or that Italian sausage/peppers/onions/potatoes thing or whatever and one serving goes on my plate for that night's dinner; the other 2-3 servings go into plastic leftover containers so all I have to do is heat them up in the microwave over the next few days. That works out great. Yesterday though, with a heat index of over 100F/37C -- by the time dinnertime rolled around, I was happy to eat a cheese sandwich for dinner! Judy -- I was given Lexapro (SSRI antidepressant) while on chemo, and while it didn't make me nauseous, and it actually started to lift my depression, it gave me intolerable sexual side effects (difficulty reaching orgasm, and the orgasms I did have were 'blunted'). I'll never go near SSRIs again because of that, and I did some more \"research\" only to find that Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant without sexual side effects! So I'm on Wellbutrin now. While I don't really feel \"happy\" or even \"peaceful\" or \"content\" yet in terms of my mood (and my perception of time is a bit weird: daytimes drag, evenings disappear at warp speed!), presuming that's what's supposed to happen if it kicks in full and works for me, at least I'm not any worse and I don't have the sexual problems I had on the Lexapro. Alaina -- I'm so glad you and your aunt are doing so well. :-D Gotta go...it's breakfast time, plus, I think I already used up today's ration of brain cells.  :-*( ~Lena. ",

Well, glad to hear you enjoyed your trip to Vermont, and also that you can check one more item off your Bucket List. OK, today's a little cooler, so I went out this morning to the supermarket, brought home 6 more empty boxes, and practically filled my car with more of those already-packed boxes (I have room for one more but I'm too tired to bring it down yet, maybe a little later).  Hmm, even though I decided Box #4 is going to be the last one going in the car for this trip, I'm still going to see if I can pack some of those six empty boxes at some point today or tonight...tomorrow, in addition to making the shopping list and packing for the trip, I need to see if I can actually clean up this place a little so I don't come home to more chaos (I EXPECT chaos at my Pack Rat's nest!

He's coming down with his pickup truck tonight to \"pre-move\" my bookshelves and as many boxes as will fit (this week I got 75-80% of the contents of my living room boxed up and ready to go). I plan to molest him tonight ;-) and after breakfast tomorrow is truck loading time....which will give me room to pack even MORE boxes..... :-O OMG, I'm gonna get REALLY spoiled -- NOT having to wait for weeks or months anymore to get my perverted little hands on him? ;-) Woo-HOO... I mean think, it still hasn't been a full week since I last wore him out...yup this is a GOOD plan! Sorry about the car, Helen. I have a ding on mine too, I've had it since JUST before starting chemo. I was coming out of the bank drive-through ATM all upset about being about to start chemo and I hit the guy in front of me. Just a fender bender (practically UNNOTICEABLE on his Toyota truck, quite ruinous looking on my right front fender but the damage was only cosmetic, the car still worked fine).  He asked me if I'd be OK with us just exchanging name/address/phone numbers and not bringing the insurance companies in on it -- he said he'd get an estimate, would call me, and I could pay him that amount. I said I could pay it myself if it was less than $500, but if it was going to be more than that, I would have no choice but to call my insurance company because I couldn't afford more than that. He said OK. He called to say the estimate was $300 something so I invited him to come over with written proof of the estimate and when he showed it to me, I wrote him a check for the amount. I didn't bother to get my own car fixed because it was cosmetic, not functional, and, I just don't have the money to make the car LOOK PRETTY again. This year I asked my mechanic how much he thought it would cost to fix it, and he said $2000. That's a no-go for me. BUT...last week when I was in NH visiting  my Pack Rat (who knows about fixing cars/getting parts and so on) -- who was outraged and shocked when I originally told him it would cost $2000 to fix it, he got online, looked stuff up and says it shouldn't cost more than $400-500 (new right fender, new right headlight assembly and paint) to fix it, so we'll be doing that in the spring. Oh and in the meanwhile, he turned some heat from his welder (I think) on the crushed right fender and was able to bend it back into somewhat slightly better shape so it's not quite as unsightly as it was. Have a good weekend all! ",

No kidding about her telling you how she feels like she got hit by a truck! :-O Geri --  Yup, the thought of finally escaping this Hellhole of Horror IS really uplifting. :-) A week ago today when I got home from my Pack Rat's house, I set myself the following goal: \"By Friday, I'll have everything on the bookshelves all packed in boxes and ready to go.\" The goal was achieved on Thursday, not Friday, in spite of my Pack Rat telling me on the phone how I'm \"way ahead\" and should take some time to relax a little, and do you know WHY I'm suddenly willing to \"kill myself\" to get out of here? Because of what I saw on Wednesday morning (this past Wednesday, 8/25) on the way to my oncologist appointment. The cancer center's transportation van driver picked me up first, but had to pick up another patient. OK, my present cancer center/hospital is located in my #2 most feared area of this city (I'll go, but only if I have to AND someone else is driving; I actually did try to drive there once but got lost, had a panic attack and as soon as I got somewhere I recognized, went straight home and called a taxi as soon as my heart stopped pounding in my chest and I could breathe again!), but this other patient lived in my #1 feared area (so bad I've never even TRIED to go there at all in the whole 25 years I've lived here), and when we picked her up, I noticed across the street from her house, a barbed wire fence.  BARBED WIRE?!?!?!?! BARBED WIRE!!!!! :-O WTF?!?!!!! I GOTTA GET *OUTTA* HERE! When I spoke to my Pack Rat that evening and told him, he said \"I've been telling you for years you're in a very bad place to be.\"  Helen -- the heat wave is coming back here, too.

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2009 10:42AM - edited Apr 13, 2009 10:44AM by Lena Sorry I've been gone, but I got hit with some major fatigue after my last post. Like I had to sleep what, 30-32 hours between Friday night and this morning? Eh well, if that's the worst of my chemo side effects (and so far it is, short of the hair business LOL), I can live with it.   Hey chelev, thanks for coming to my Pity Party! But wow, you think I'm FUNNY?! I thought the only people who considered me funny were total bizarrions with psychotic warped senses of humor! Well, wow, thanks! I find it ironic because the only time I laugh now is when there is no mirror in the room with me. And pictures, no freakin' way. Dunno if you're a masochist or not, but I've always hated having my picture taken and am one of those people who runs out of the room and hides (or leaves!) if someone takes out a camera. I have never owned a camera myself and I hate that shutterbug crap. My aversion to having pics of me taken has been a lifelong thing (and I don't care to subject other people to something I violently abhor myself either, so photographs and photography are something I mostly excised from my life years ago: the only pics I have of others are ones others took but that's OK, I don't need many!).    I'm not and never was photogenic, I looked horrible in every single picture ever taken of me -- pics were forced on me as a kid by my shutterbug mother who I wanted to strangle because she always insisted on displays of happy emotions I didn't feel, but as an adult on the very rare occasions I actually allowed someone to take my picture, which was intervals of YEARS -- even when I'd thought I'd looked nice that day in the mirror and was wearing something I really liked and thought I looked good in, when I later saw the pictures they were still awful! My most recent pic was taken in 2006, but the most recent one I'd let anyone see MAYBE was taken in 2003! And this was when I (usually LOL) liked the way I looked -- which, being a Stage IV girl, I may not live long enough to ever do again. Now, though, anyone who would dare point a camera in my direction -- never mind my running out of the room and hiding, they would be asking to die horribly -- beginning with my smashing the freakin' camera right in their faces before I beat them with caliath, skin and disembowel them alive in the tradition of my favorite fictional warrior clan.   Ah, but I digress. Yeah, I know, I still have to get the next transitional haircut, i.e., the military buzz, but now here's some more bizarre for you...I'm a nighttime shower-taker.  Well, because I quit both coloring and blow drying my hair in the late 80s in my desperate efforts to make it be \"healthy enough to grow to my butt,\" my regular shower time became 7:30-8 PM or thereabouts -- so that by a reasonable bedtime (10 PM) my hair would dry naturally and I wouldn't be going to sleep damp headed (which made it wavy, and I liked it straight).    Well, Saturday night I got in the shower a little late (9 PM), guess I figured short hair would dry faster, right? Um, no, it didn't, and on top of that, I got tired early too (the chemo no doubt) -- and didn't care about going to sleep with undried hair, so I just went to bed damp headed. So I get up yesterday morning, have my coffee, go into the bathroom to brush my teeth and hair -- and my hair actually seemed to look ALMOST TOLERABLE! No, I still didn't LIKE it, but I felt like I could put up with it to the point where I actually CONSIDERED running downstairs -- WITHOUT MY WIG --  to the mailboxes in the apt building entryway to leave my bills for the mailman to take. OK yeah I chickened out in the end and didn't do it, but I actually did give it a few moments of real live serious thought.  (Gotta go out today or tomorrow anyway, as in OUT out, to run a couple of errands, so I'll just put on my wig and take the mail to the PO)...   Last night my Pack Rat called and I told him how I'd considered stepping outside my apt for 30 seconds without my wig, and he said, \"I'm glad you're starting to see this a LITTLE more rationally now.\" LOL. My reply was, \"You're a guy. This is a girl thing!\" to which he said, \"Must be.\"  Even though we don't agree about everything, he UNDERSTANDS everything else about me, and I mean EVERYTHING, like nobody else in the universe ever came remotely close to (including the man I was once married to or even my friend Kym!) -- except for this. He has even told me outright that when I'm bald THAT won't faze him either, \"I've seen bald women before...\" :-O  So OK, he just doesn't get this...so yeah, I guess it's a \"girl thing.\"  All the more strange because my hair is the ONLY thing I'm \"girly\" about. I don't wear makeup and I'm not interested in clothes except that they should fit me comfortably, be weather-appropriate and hide my Midsection from Hell.   The weird thing is, while brushing my UG-LEE short hair on Sat night before I got into the shower I had actually said to myself, \"Monday I should call Ms. Scissors Happy and make an appointment for the buzz cut this week -- I hate how I look so much already, how much worse can it get?\" But then yesterday morning when I was able to barely tolerate it, I was thinking maybe putting the buzz off another week, wasn't ready to go back to TOTALLY hideous so soon...I dunno....maybe when my coffee sinks in a bit more, I'll be able to think about it again. But I know, yes, I \"need\" to do it this week or by early next week......  ::::shudder:::::   Ahhh, food. Yeah, I ate dinner like a storm the day I came home from chemo, but since then, no, and no, that's not how I normally eat either (only when my Pack Rat is here, which on average is every couple of MONTHS). I haven't felt sick/nauseous or even slightly \"anti-food,\" and what I've eaten has tasted good so far -- it's just that I haven't felt like eating MUCH, and haven't felt like cooking at ALL. I microwaved the leftovers from Post Chemo Dinner on Friday (eggplant parm with ziti is filling, so it was enough for two meals!). Saturday I ate two small meals of instant oatmeal and canned fruit before and after the 4-hour naps LOL, and yesterday I had instant oatmeal for \"breakfast\" (noontime), and a can of Chunky sirloin burger soup for dinner after the 3-hour nap. I know, it doesn't sound like much, but truth be told I don't have a huge appetite anyway (so where in the heck do I get this Midsection from Hell?!) and this isn't too different from what's normal for me. I usually only eat once or twice a day anyway, and the fact is, I did feel hungry so wasn't forcing myself to eat, and when I ate, it tasted good to me so I enjoyed it.  Pre-chemo I'd have still probably \"only\" eaten the oatmeal with or without fruit earlier in the day (or maybe a sandwich or scrambled egg, something light), but instead of the canned soup, yeah, dinner would have been a \"real meal\"  -- specifically I'd been in the mood for chicken and rice with green beans, but was too tired to bother cooking it (and just could not handle the idea of having to wash pots and pans if I cooked!) so I just microwaved the soup! Haven't eaten yet today but I'll get around to it when I'm hungry.   Oooh, I love garlic bread -- didn't order any when we had the Italian dinner after chemo (was more in the mood for a cheesecake dessert LOL), but garlic bread in general, YUMMMMM, and I do order it -- or garlic KNOTS! -- most of the time when I have Italian.  :-) Dunno if I avoided heartburn by not having garlic bread on chemo night, but heartburn is mostly a non-issue with me anyway (probably because I dislike and don't eat ANY \"hot\" and very little spicy food: garlic bread/garlic knots is actually the only significantly spicy food I like and that never gave me heartburn). I did buy a bottle of Pepcid maximum strength just in case during my \"Stock Up on Chemo Survival Supplies\" run a couple weeks ago because I'd read that heartburn can happen from chemo and wanted to be ready, but I haven't had to take any yet.   Yummmm, rice pudding! I just put that on my next shopping list. Dunno why I didn't think of it before, but I'll be sure to get some....   ...or maybe not...About weight gain (ugggh that's almost as bad as bald!) -- both my oncologist and my chemo nurse told me women on chemo DO gain weight and that I shouldn't be surprised if I put on 10-20 pounds even if I eat less than usual (which I'm not so far: I still get hungry 1-2x a day, and I eat when I'm hungry in exactly the quantity I feel like eating). Not looking forward to this at all. If I believed in God I'd pray not to gain one more OUNCE even. At 5'5 135 pounds, ehhh, I'm \"okay,\" but I'd rather DROP 10-20 pounds (off the Midsection from Hell of course LOL) than GAIN -- I'm at what I consider to be my \"maximum acceptable\" weight right now. No more, please! (Yeah, Lena, so don't eat any more freakin' cheesecake and no garlic bread either next time, right?)   Nadine....  *hugs* thank you for joining me in my Pity Party too!   My hair is already too short for a pony tail; Kym gave me a pretty short \"first transition\" haircut straight off. I actually asked her to in the hope it would \"prepare\" me for the upcoming horrors of buzz cut and bald. It didn't really but OK, what's done is done. So since the Saturday before my first chemo, it's only been halfway down my NECK. The military buzz is next as I was mentioning, and I'm still shuddering to think about it even though I've finished my coffee by now and it's begun to take effect. Maybe if my head was hurting like you said yours had done, I'd be able to see getting a buzz cut or outright shaving my head as a relief from pain as you did....but I can't....and I don't even appreciate the lower maintenance of short hair (it's not worth it to me)...even though I HAVE TO admit that you're 1000% right about that part.   Absolutely yes --  with short hair (even not buzzed or bald yet), showers ARE a lot faster, I use way less shampoo/conditioner, initial detangling and fussing with the center part when I finish toweling went from 10-15 mins to next to nonexistent because I can just comb it back, and on top of that, I don't need to spend 2 hours post-shower doing something sitting up while periodically running the wide tooth comb through my hair so it dries STRAIGHT AND UNTANGLED by the time I go to sleep...but somehow I still think it was easier and less limiting to do all that long hair maintenance crap than I'm finding it to put on my wig (which for me is a wrestling match because of my partial left hand paralysis) when I have to go out.    I don't feel \"in control\" at all, because I feel FORCED to accept something I consider unacceptable and absolutely would NEVER have chosen to do -- whether I cut my hair or not, it'll fall out anyway from the chemo --  not \"acceptable.\"  My decision to cut was solely based on the idea that it's the \"lesser of the evils\" to cut it before it falls out as compared to shedding all over the place like an overheated sheep dog -- but \"lesser of the evils\" is, IMNSHO, still EVIL. If I end up discovering that ALL the choices necessary to live are between respective evils (as compared to choosing between desirable or mostly desirable alternatives which may have a \"price tag\" but basically put me somewhere I'd more or less like to be or at least don't mind too much), well, that's my \"breaking point\" on how far I go with this. If all I have to look forward to is living with evil, I can't be bothered anymore.   IMO having cancer is the ultimate exercise in OUT OF CONTROL. Besides that nobody signs up for this, think: the very nature of cancer is *abnormal cells reproducing out of control* to the point where, if not treated at all, we'll end up with gigantic tumors, weeping sores, pain, organ failure because abnormal cells don't function and tumors crowd out what's left of the normal cells, and a totally horrible death (although for some patients the treatment side effects don't sound much worse than this).   Mmmmm, I guess once I go Marine, I won't need conditioner at all anymore (never mind a comb or brush), huh? Just a tiny drop of shampoo? Bald, I guess, just wash my head with the same liquid body soap I use on the rest of me?   Oh....ugggh....still.....   Hope you all are doing OK..... P.? Dare I ask, how was your TCH? Thursday was my start day too, only I'm getting AC/T. My preliminary MUGA scan showed my heart could take the A and my oncologist said my cancer is very aggressive and AC/T is better for that reason, though he did consider TCH for me at first (before he saw the bone met!). How many TCH rounds for you? Is this pre- or post-mastectomy for you? I'm supposed to have 6 rounds of the AC/T prior to mastectomy. One down, five to go...next onc appt is 4/20, next chemo is 4/30...   Kathy? Geri? You okay?   Oh, Geri, I had bookmarked several wig sites a couple months ago, and found one at headcovers.com I liked a lot, but I was reluctant to buy a wig online because I was afraid it would arrive and I wouldn't be able to figure out how to put it on, or be physically able to do it, at a point where my hair was either too short (like it is now) or gone altogether. Having zero past experience with wigs, I had to be able to try on a real wig in a real wig shop to make sure. If the shopkeeper hadn't shown me, I'd never have figured it out. I didn't even know what she was talking about when she said \"wig cap\" until she showed me one.  I know this all sounds totally ridiculous, but I'm spatially retarded (can't figure out anything with 'assembly required') and my left hand is partially paralyzed...so I did learn to put on a wig and can do it but it's still a wrestling match.  Anyhoo, the \"cheap\" immediate \"quickie\" wig (the one I tried on in the store with the shopkeeper showing me how; the one I have now) cost $90 -- my friend Kym went halfies on it with me, and then she took me to another shop saying I \"have to\" have a custom wig for the long term. My hair grows slowly, so presuming I live that long, it's going to take 3 years minimum post chemo for my real hair to grow back to my definition of acceptable \"don't need a wig anymore\" length (shoulder-length), and 5-6 to get back to what I LIKE (halfway down my back to almost waist-length), which, even though it's shockingly expensive (over a grand, and when I said to her \"are you nuts?!\" she said she'd EXPECTED a wig like that to cost at least $1,000 before she even brought me into the custom wig shop!) she insisted on paying for whatever my Medicaid won't cover on it (my chemo nurse wrote me a prescription for \"medical hair prosthesis\" and the saleslady said Medicaid would cover most or all of it). That one's going to take longer because it's custom, but since the \"quickie\" looks nice and I don't have to go out hideous even if I'm bald by the time I get it, I'm as OK as I can be with this. Both the quickie and the custom are halfway down my back, only the custom is my actual real haircolor and is human hair, not synthetic like the quickie.   I had also considered buying a scarf or two (saw some nice ones at TLC and headcovers.com) but I have way too much trouble tying things, so I'll stick with the wigs.   And bombus, FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL and allow yourself to express your honest emotions (you too Geri!) Cancer sucks, none of us asked for this and there is nothing wrong with pity partying if that's how you really feel -- and if you do, as far as I'm concerned, it's  NATURAL and NORMAL! Who in the hell is going to feel glad and happy with breast cancer?!  If we could or did, why would we \"need\" an online support group? Cry all you need to and don't pay attention to anybody who tries to exhort phony emotions from you. If or when a time comes that you do feel better emotionally and GENUINELY feel positive, more power to you.   Until next time...   ~Lena.   P.S. Chelev -- I had a Neulasta shot Friday (the day after infusion) -- no issues, unless that's what made me so tired over the weekend instead of the AC/T.... (and hi,TractorGirl!)...",

I didn\u2019t even have the new DSL hooked up and configured until late Monday afternoon/early evening -- and that\u2019s only because I hooked up a makeshift \u201ccomputer camp-out\u201d in the living room using the \u201centertainment center\u201d shelf as a desk for the iBook, sitting on one of the kitchen chairs. While I\u2019ve made some decent progress with the house since then, none of it has been in the intended computer room. That, and the living room, both look like a bomb blew up in them, and probably will until my Pack Rat has the energy to reassemble the bookshelves, put the TV on top of the \u201centertainment center,\u201d so I can \u201cdo \u201c the living room, then I need him to move the file cabinet, put the Quicksilver on the computer desk and deal with the wiring issue (the only phone jacks are downstairs in the living room and kitchen, and the computer room is upstairs, so I can\u2019t rebuild The Network until a \u201ccreative wiring scheme\u201d is in place, and we can\u2019t do that until there\u2019s room to work in the computer room which will not exist unless the bookshelf, filing cabinet and Quicksilver are moved so I can get THOSE five tons of boxes too, unpacked and put away so there WILL be room to do the wiring thing. I am not physically able to reassemble bookshelves, pick up the Quicksilver, filing cabinet or TV set . And now, back to our regularly scheduled installment of The Great Migration.....now where did I leave off? Ohhhhh.    OK, the guy from the boat house never showed up. So we ended up totally fucked on Saturday morning with NO HELP on the NJ end and taking way longer than the 2 or 2 1/2 hours it would have been with two men (Pack Rat and Erick [Kym\u2019s husband] or my Pack Rat and the boathouse guy had he shown up -- and we got a late start because we waited an hour for him). About 4 hours into doing it ourselves (read: my poor Pack Rat struggling down three flights of stairs, through the courtyard and across the street to the moving truck with me \u201cspotting him\u201d and doing minor helping to guide stuff around the \u201cturns\u201d) and maybe half done, I see a guy come out of one of the houses across the street. I offer him $50 to help with the rest, and thankfully he accepts. They got it done. But of course this threw us way off schedule: instead of getting on the road at noon-12:30 like we'd hoped, we started out on the Great Migration at 3 PM, and arrived at the Pack Rat Nest around 10:30 or 11 PM. And where we got the energy I don\u2019t know, but us rats had some major heat. ;-) Or maybe we just needed some stress relief? ;-)   Sunday morning was much better -- breakfast at the general store, then meeting his cousins who had volunteered to help unload the moving truck at my house. Shane, Sherri and Kristen met us here, and Shane, who is really talented when it comes to driving large vehicles, backed the big moving truck up the hill and parked it right up by my front door -- ummm, after we rescued them from a sudden oil leak in Sherri's car which they were coming in, that is.  After unloading the truck I took us all out for pizza (and they like their pizza the way I like mine, too -- cool!) -- then they all took the big truck back to the Pack Rat Nest and loaded it up with all the stuff we had pre-moved in August and September -- I stayed here and started unpacking stuff here to simultaneously start my own nest-building/clear out some boxes so to make room for more --  then they brought it back here and more unloading, so all my stuff got loaded in on Sunday, giving me enough work to keep me just about as busy for the next few months as if I had a full time job.   Oh, and did I tell you it's WONDERFUL here????????     Now for some of the \u201cadventures\u201d -- apparently it seems that I somehow left my driving phobia back in NJ! I am not afraid of driving here -- not even doing \u201cfirst time by myself\u201d drives to places I\u2019m not 100% absolutely sure of the route!  I made it to my Pack Rat\u2019s Nest with NO wrong turns and NO panic attacks (OMG my Pack Rat is REALLY only 20 minutes away, too. And, same with the laundromat, library and supermarket -- got there no problems whatsoever.   Oh, and the laundromat (yes, the LAUNDROMAT!) has free WiFi!! Since I listened to my Pack Rat and used most of my clothes as packing material for my moving boxes, I had a ton of \"excess\" laundry, and there\u2019s going to be more on the way since I know many of the yet-to-be-unpacked boxes were \"solidified\" with clothes. Since I had what at my old place would have been six loads of laundry (3 trips up and down those four fllights of stairs just to get it all in the laundry room too!), and what was I gonna do while the machines were doing the work -- of course, \"have iBook will travel\" -- but I'd figured on playing my sims. So I get the wash started (TRIPLE LOADERS!! Have you ever heard of such a thing?!) -- what would have been six loads last week was three loads yesterday -- well 2 1/2 so I used 3 washers), then I'm taking the iBook out of its travel bag, and the laundromat's proprietress sees me with a laptop and tells me about the WiFi.  OMG! So while doing laundry yesterday, I got to do some catching up on Sims forums and email and even send one of the new members at CTO Sims all my \"adult\" Sims files and tell her how she can hack any bed to be an adult love bed which will work as long as she has the animations which I'm happy to supply -- and even actually talk to people too.  Do you know that people actually talk to each other here?! I feel like I moved to another PLANET, not another STATE! I met a really cool lady who had moved up here from a nasty part of Bridgeport CT, the way she described it sounded exactly like where I just moved out of in NJ, and she was kind of like me because she also lives by herself, likes it, and has a boyfriend too!    After the laundromat  I visited my Pack Rat and hung out with him while he was taking his lunch break from work (this is one of his work from home weeks). How cool is THAT? And sure as shit impossible while I was in NJ!   Then more work on  making the house \u201chome\u201d (you can call me the Unpack Rat now LOL) and while putting more empty boxes out on the porch, met my neighbors! (the residents of Units 1 and 2; I\u2019m in Unit 3); they happened to be out on their porches, we saw each other, all said hello, exchanged names and chatted a bit. They all seem really nice. Here\u2019s some serious bizarreness, though: I lived in my last apartment for 25 years and the only neighbors I knew by name were the ones who lived immediately next door to me.     So yesterday I got the dresser drawers back in the dresser, all the clean dresser clothes in, and I think 45% of the closet clothes have shown up/been washed and put away. So I only had to live out of a suitcase for four days. Not bad, I packed it for a week! Bedroom nighttables are still  in the living room (meaning I need my Padk Rat to haul that upstairs!) --  in the meantime I managed to drag one of the \u201clight\u201d living room end tables upstairs since the boxes I\u2019d had the lamp and clock on, were gone; they had clothes which I unpacked and put away..   Bathroom done easy, not much to do except bring in the liquid body soap, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrush, towels, etc. I do need to unpack and display the gas meter but I think I want to get the whole house totally functional before I start decorating it. So for now I only have the one giant rat on the bed. Yeah, decorating is going to be FUN....so much incredible windowsill space in the kitchen, perfect for all the rubber rats and bugs who used to live atop the computer hutch. Need to fix the bathroom spider, too...   Today I discovered that I have a kitchen -- a real live kitchen! Went to the supermarket this morning -- totally stocked up the freezer  and fridge, plus unpacked (and put away) all the canned/dry goods \u201cpantry stuff\u201d I brought with me from the old place. Oh, and what a supermarket, too! Produce to totally die for, the whole place laid out easy and sensibly, had no trouble finding anything even though this was the first time I\u2019d shopped there by myself!  (been there with my Pack Rat a couple of times, widely separated occasions, and only to pick up a few things, not to stock up a whole fridge from scratch like I did today). And lots of space, no overcrowding...and apparently no need for an armed policeman by the exit like at my NJ supermarket...ineptly named ShopRite -- now I think they should call it ShopWrong!   OK I really need to go pass out now, I am sooo exhausted and everything hurts, but, busy tomorrow too....Linen Closet! Plus I bought the wrong peppers today (cubanesque or something like that) and need to take them back and try to exchange them for the ones I really wanted (green bell peppers), and hit the UPS store to return my NJ Verizon DSL equipment. If I'd known the UPS store was right next to the supermarket I'd have brought that with me today, but I only just happened to notice it on the way to the market!   Will try to come back soon, wanna comment on all YOUR adventures too (like Amy's onc: my onc in NJ wasn't as bad as yours but your story reminded me of mine: I'm hoping the new one I get here will be a lot better in terms of being able to deal with a patient-doctor TEAM approach)....    ~Lena.",

Well Judy maybe I can get out of bed by myself so \"soon\" because I'm healing up a little faster, since in addition to no recon, I also didn't have any nodes taken either (I wouldn't let them!).   I guess I'm probably going to have to find some other way to feel any kind of \"beautiful\" now, although at the moment I don't have a freakin' clue on how or where to look. Maybe after I heal up enough to at least not have the Recently Dissected \"Chest of Frankenstein\" look I'll get more ideas. I hope. About clothes shopping -- I think maybe one of my X-chromosomes may be defective; I totally and completely lack a shopping gene! Yes -- there actually IS a woman who hates shopping; ME! I've hated shopping since I was a little girl! I remember how I hated the \"back to school\" shopping trips just prior to the new school year when Mom would take us (me and my sister) to buy new clothes and shoes. All that looking and browsing and trying on, it was such an annoying pain in the butt. As an adult, I only go clothes shopping when the clothes I have get too worn or ripped or don't fit me. Until now though, \"clothes don't fit\" meant \"I got too fat.\" This is the first time \"clothes don't fit\" means means buying smaller -- not just on top due to bosom elimination but pants and skirts too. Remember my mention of my two pairs of \"2009 jeans\" I'd worn going into chemo and complained about them not fitting anymore because of all the weight I'd put on? Well those weren't REALLY \"2009\" jeans, I originally bought them back in 2003 (a few months after I started seeing my Pack Rat) in reluctant acceptance of \"getting old and fat\" -- i.e., weighing 130-135 instead of my former 120-125. Yup, I was still wearing those same jeans from 2003 until a few months after I finished my chemo -- that's when I started packing on all that weight from stopping smoking and going on the hormone treatments; by around December 2009 or January 2010 I couldn't even put them on anymore. Well several months into my dieting (diet started May 2010 at 155 pounds -- around October or November 2010 or so I was able to wear them again, but once I \"finished\" dieting in March, I noticed they were way too big on me! They actually slip down to my hips and I was \"forced\" to replace them with ones that fit. Well that's the good news about my body; it took me a little adjusting to get to \"maintenance mode\" diet-wise; went up 3 pounds, readjusted and actually got down to 121 and since I liked that better than the goal of 125 (being small boned, even just a few pounds in either direction makes a visible difference on me), and the up 3 down 4 adjustments fine tuned my ability to judge how much food is right without having to plan meals and count calories in advance, I learned that just because I'm old doesn't mean I can't have my younger weight range of 120-125 back (that's where I was weight-wise in my 20s!). I haven't weighed myself since the morning of surgery (just before getting dressed to go to the hospital -- normally I weigh myself each morning just before getting dressed and having morning coffee) but up to then I've been holding incredibly steady at a very very nice 122 pounds all month. I was thinking this morning I'd love to get on the scale except I'm still wearing the drains. Eh, well maybe tomorrow I'll do it anyway and if I weigh more than 122 I'll blame it on the drains and their belt and little pouches. LOL. But yeah, I'm going to have to get SOME new clothes to fit the new body in addition to the 2 pairs of emergency jeans I recently bought just to HAVE jeans that aren't falling off me. Guess I'll do it when I take the old ones to the thrift shop; I'll already be there anyway. Now if only I actually knew what this svelte but completely flat-chested woman whose still too-short hair looks like she stuck a fork in an electric socket (yes, again! :-P) would even want to wear. I don't know how to buy clothes for strangers. :::::sigh::::: ",

OMG Amy on that horrible poison ivy and rash -- that probably took as much fun out of your vacation as all this illness and radiation has taken out of my summer.  :-( Glad you're starting to heal up, though. Oh, BTW, I got the same result Helen got when clicking on your links to the pictures of your trip -- nada. Rads at 12/33 now and SEs are starting. The coughing began over the weekend and on Sunday night when my Pack Rat was here, all of those multiple coughing fits that woke me up woke HIM up too. Got both Dayquil and Nyquil now, so I think I can start to control it. Skin is beginning to get pink today too in spite of my slatherings of Jeans cream immediately after every treatment and then again a few hours after I get home.  I tire very easily and have next to no ambition, but I'm still not sure if I can blame the fatigue on the rads yet though, seeing how I'm recovering from what almost amounted to near fatal kidney failure too (and was also just as tired and unmotivated from the time the \"mystery ailment\"/blocked ureter problem started almost a month ago)... The only real burst of energy I really had was Sunday when my Pack Rat was here (yeah, we're back to you-know-what already) so maybe I just need another good jolt from him and tomorrow is Hump Day so gotta invite him over. ;-) Oh yeah and Shuttlecraft T'Kiri (my car) is now \"fixed\" -- my Pack Rat did a great job with the new fender. He found the same color -- amazing -- it's an odd sort of metallic teal-ish color, not something simple and easy to find/do...so he painted the fender and installed that and the new headlight assembly so now you have to get real close and look carefully in one certain area to even be able to tell anymore that I had the accident -- and it only cost me $300, not the $2,000 I was estimated it would have cost in NJ (he did the work but I paid for the stuff). So now I can expect Shuttlecraft T'Kiri to pass an inspection so I can get her all New Hampshirized....but for this whole month my medical schedule has not only ruined my summer but makes it almost impossible to find the time to do it all (need to do the license and registration stuff as well as inspection -- my NJ license and plates don't actually expire till June 2012 so even though I \"should have\" changed over by 60 days living here, I'm not a cop magnet driving around with expired stuff so I'm getting away with it).... OHHHHHHHH WAIT!!!!!! The rads techs \"owe me a favor\" because on very short notice I agreed to reschedule two of my treatments to make things easier for THEM (instead of my usual 11:45s I had today's rads at 2 PM and Thursday's will be at 3 PM), so I'll pick a day then tell them I want to come in at 9 AM so I can have the rest of the day to take care of my car business. Except now when I open my iCal and see my medical schedule it practically drives me to an anxiety attack. :-P ...so who knows...between almost no energy/motivation and an aversion to looking at my schedule or planning anything, now I dunno when I'll do it.  LOL  Feel well everyone. ",

Are you postmenopausal? If you are, I think that's probably the main reason why your doctor talked about Arimidex. I'm not. I was perimenopausal at the time of my diagnosis in Feb 2009. For the 3-4 years immediately preceding my diagnosis, both the timing and \"flow consistency\" of my cycles had been getting weirder and weirder off the map from my former near clockwork regular cycles -- but I had not entirely stopped menstruating for a year or more. My longest total skip prior to chemo had been to miss two periods. What small amount I'd read about AIs vs. Tamoxifen is that Tamox is given to premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women get AIs. Since chemo, I had only one period (4/22/09, which was after my first treatment but before my second), but I was told that at my age (47 then, but I just turned 48 in June), chemo would most likely push me into permanent menopause -- and in addition to having had no periods since the one 4/22 and more hot flashes than I can count -- Iooks like my being \"only\" perimenopausal instead of actually postmenopausal when  I started chemo is why they're treating me as premenopausal. But still, it's been less than a year since my last period, so I think that's why I got Tamoxifen instead of something else.   From what I read in the article about Zometa, looks to me like Zometa apparently popped into my oncologist's head because I have a bone metastasis (left iliac bone). I do have occasional intermittent pain in my left hip from it, but haven't approached anything remotely bad enough in terms of intensity or \"constantness\" of pain to justify going on Zometa or even to take pain meds -- maybe that's also why he said \"eventually he might\" want to put me on Zometa instead of saying he thinks I should go on it right away. Linda, I hope your oncologist has no cause to ever think of considering putting you on Zometa.   Anyhoo...moving right along...   Tammy, {{hug}} -- for finishing up your chemo!   About Neulasta shots -- Titan, good you decided to get it after all. I went, without arguing with either my oncologist or chemo nurse about it, to get all six of the Neulasta shots I was supposed to have, and TWICE I STILL ended up with white counts low enough to be well into the danger zone. I shudder to think what those counts would have been if I hadn't gotten the shots. I hated them too, but.....I don't regret having had them, even though I do regret having let myself be talked into chemo.   Chelev, your mismatched earrings story might not be chemo brain -- unless, of course, you pretty yourself up for work in a brightly lit place. If you do, then arrgh, you do still have chemo brain! :-(   {{hug}} I hope it goes away!   I had something sort of similar happen to me 2-3 years ago (before ANY of this cancer stuff had even started with me), but my apartment is dark and dingy even with the lights on, and quite honestly my eyesight had also begun deteriorating from age before I got cancer. Well, my preferred work clothes were simple and professional but comfortable -- enough to be in line with \"business/business casual\" dress codes. Most of the time that meant I'd dress for work by putting on a \"nice blouse or sweater with dress slacks,\" with knee-his with my slacks (or occasional long skirts) and flats or low heeled pumps for shoes. Most days I'd wear plain old \"nude\" colored knee-his, but sometimes when I wore my black slacks, I'd wear black knee-his instead, to break up the monotony I suppose. However, I also had some navy knee-his to wear with my navy slacks/navy low heeled pumps and this particular multicolored but with dark blues in it long skirt-and-blouse outfit I also liked to wear to work occasionally.   Sooo....one day I go to work in one of my blouse with black slacks and low heeled black pumps outfits, and, like you, while I was in the ladies room at work (which was WAY more brightly lit than my apartment!), I happened to actually look down at my feet and notice a mismatch -- there I am with a black knee-hi on my left foot and a navy knee-hi on my right foot. If anyone else had noticed, they never said anything to me, and I didn't trouble myself to point it out to anyone even to joke about it. I did, however, from that day onwards, take a flashlight to my knee-his when both pairing them up to put away after washing/letting them air dry, and again before getting dressed for work when I wanted to shake up the nude knee-his routine.   Paula -- you DON'T deserve your cancer, and your husband doesn't deserve his Guillain Barre syndrome either. I'm sorry he got it, but glad to hear the docs fixed him up, and {{hugs}} on finishing your chemo.    I'm so glad you were feeling well enough 9 days out to have even been thinking about a weekend shore trip with your husband. Wow, what a concept! I'm 9 days out of my final treatment today, and I can't even motivate myself to cook an actual meal beyond scrambled eggs. There's no way in hell I'm ready to go anywhere that's not an absolute necessity (medical visits, grocery store, bank).   Last night I ordered a pizza because I was tired of scrambled eggs, instant hot cereal and microwaved canned soup. Today I'm still exhausted to all hell, and my mouth still tastes like a sewer, but the leftover pizza I microwaved today actually tasted mostly like pizza (wish I could say it tasted half as good when I ordered it and it got here fresh, but it didn't: it was just something to eat that didn't require me to expend energy on cooking or cleaning up after beyond throwing out paper plates!).  Well, I hope mostly tasting my leftover pizza today is a good sign.   I gotta go lie down again now, so  I hope you fellow finishers are beginning to feel better faster than I am, and those of you still on chemo, I wish you as few side effects as possible.   ~Lena.    ",

The reason I wear them in winter is because it's either wear the hat or suffer the \"cold earaches\" I get if I go hatless on  a windy, cold day. Other than that though, no hats for me, ever.  LOL with you here too -- I don't understand why healthy people with full heads of hair wear baseball caps either (outside of playing baseball or softball).   Sewer Mouth (at least when I talk about having it) isn't excessive use of swear words...I use that term to describe the constant disgusting yucky taste in my mouth from the chemo. A lot of people have posted (and even my chemo nurse when she was initially telling me common SEs to expect) that chemo leaves a METALLIC taste in the mouth. Even here in BCO's pre-chemo shopping list was a suggestion to stock up on plastic eating utensils so as not to worsen the Metal Mouth by eating with regular silverware. Well, my mouth never tasted metallic, it just tasted FOUL. So I started calling it Sewer Mouth. And yes, I still have it... :-(   Betsy -- I'm happy to agree to disagree with you on the \"bald is beautiful\" concept, but I'm absolutely in full agreement with you on the issue of not wanting to be in studies which will mean taking the whatever-it-is for a few YEARS, and for fear of the SEs. The only way I'd consider saying yes to being in any study would be if the drug was something my doctor wanted to put me on anyway, and, if it was something I agreed with his suggestion to try. And the only substances I'll ever agree to at this point would be ones that do NOT have any of the side effects I had from chemo (or ones associated with chemo which I was lucky enough not to get, like bone/joint aches or my nails turning weird colors and falling off).    And yes, Betsy, \"do no harm\" IS supposed to be the guiding principle of medical practice. It's from the Hippocratic Oath, which all doctors supposedly take when they finish medical school and go into practice. The original version (translated into English -- my friend Google found it for me) reads as follows:   I swear by Apollo, the healer, Asclepius, Hygieia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath and agreement: To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me this art; to live in common with him and, if necessary, to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art. I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion. But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts. I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art. In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men, be they free or slaves. All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal. If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.   But there is also a modern version written in 1964 (thanks again to my good friend Google), which is the current version used:   I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug. I will not be ashamed to say \"I know not,\" nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.   Apparently the Hippocratic Oath makes me, at least, wonder where chemo fits in, when it comes to \"doing no harm\" to the patient. There I was running around with advanced cancer for who knows how long and with the exception of occasional slight twinges of pain, I felt FINE -- until I agreed to be TREATED for it, and THEN I ended up feeling deathly ill and like complete crap! (Maybe I should have waited for it to make me feel ill, so I wouldn't have minded the treatment so much? LOL, but for me, the treatment has been FAR worse than the disease!)   But, I digress...last but certainly not least...   Paula -- I'm glad you and your girlfriend didn't get arrested for boozing it up in public like that! LOL!  I hope the study goes OK, i.e., no bad SEs or wanting to drop out on account of them. But yeah, if your onc says you need to be on any of this stuff, you may as well at least try to participate in the study.   Hmmmm, maybe my brain is coming back a tiny bit today! It only took me about an hour to write this post, and I was able to address some of you specifically! Posts of this kind of length and specificity WERE taking me 2, 3 and 4 hours (up to a full morning or afternoon) to write, when I bothered at all.   Well, gotta go now. Hope you all feel as good as you can possibly feel.   ~Lena.      ",

So he suggested that since it was a beautiful day to go for a ride, would I be interested, and I said yes. He turned out to be right about the road he wanted being closed. His alternate route works, but we did get slowed down in one area where they were doing construction, and saw a good deal of the remains of some houses and cars and mud from flooded out areas. That was kind of scary looking, but all in all, the ride was beautiful. We stopped at the supermarket on the way home and I picked up stuff to make an Italian Rainbow for dinner.  Haven't made one of those since, hmmmm, maybe a week or two before going to the hospital with kidney failure and then the rads. Haven't lost my touch though; it was delicious, and so are the leftovers (almost gone already!). And there were \"evening festivities,\" too. ;-) He was doing what he used to call \"winding the spring\" in the \"old days.\" I only wish I'd been better able to breathe (the damn ascites is really in the way of everything), and that my hip hadn't chosen that time to hurt (the iliac met itself healed up, but left enough damage to the bone that I still have occasional pain there). We had fun, but had to be careful. Tomorrow morning -- he had already invited me for the \"real\" ride to Vermont to buy the transfer case -- we're going out to this diner for breakfast, then to Vermont again. Betsy -- OMG that's awful about having to have the uterine biopsy! I hope it goes OK. Hopefully what's left of my brain will remind me to be sure to come back here on Tuesday to find out how you did. That's GREAT you're on vacation at least! I hope the rest of it (other than having to have the biopsy and possibly get paranoid waiting for results) is nice, relaxing and you unwind completely. And yeah, I'll do what I can to hold on for my Pack Rat so long as it doesn't finish killing what's left of me before I actually die, if that makes any sense. Remember, if it hadn't been for him I would have declined treatment in the first place so we wouldn't be having this conversation now! LOL Amy -- I didn't see your request to hug my Pack Rat for everyone until now, so I'll have to save it for tonight or tomorrow. He's gotta leave on Sunday to go back to CT for his monthly week of working in the office so as usual he's got a lot to do at home before he goes. Our plans for tomorrow are on, but tonight is tentative. I'd asked him Wednesday night after we wore each other out, \"Could I possibly tempt you over here Friday night with an offer of chicken parmigiana for dinner?\" LOL he said maybe. I understand if he can't (and told him I won't be upset if he can't make it, but just \"had\" to ask at least) -- in which case I'll finish the Italian Rainbow instead, but we'll see. OH! One of my little canteloupes came off its vine a few days ago. I put it in my kitchen table fruit bowl to let it get ripe and had it for dessert last night. It wasn't as sweet as the \"regular\" canteloupe I buy in the supermarket but it wasn't bad either. And since the weather says it's going to get down to freezing tonight and tomorrow night (hence frost for tomorrow and Sunday mornings), gotta pick all the little green grape tomatoes today and hope they ripen in the house. Several gardening sites I Googled say they should be picked before frost and most will ripen (and taste ALMOST as good as vine ripened); that I'll probably only lose a few to mold or rot, but if I leave them out in the frost, I'll lose all of them, and that would suck! Even though they're all green, there must be enough of them to put in three or four, maybe five, salads! . . I had been hoping the frost would hold off until they could ripen on the vine, but this is New Hampshire, after all! You know, that place where you Live Freeze and Die! Gotta check and see if cucumbers will make it or not or if I have to pick them today too. Have a wonderful weekend, everybody.  :-) ",

So I just so happen to know you need a hug. {{{{{Betsy}}}}}  But....even though I'm still a long way off from \"pretty\" (particularly with \"Return of the Awful Ascites\"), I did get to a new milestone in that direction: I can finally put my hair in a ponytail. Funny thing is I hated ponytails when I had my long hair (I only wore them when I HAD to -- working in the lab for safety reasons, or cooking/eating so I wouldn't get hair in the food) -- but now I'm thinking it might get me through the rest of the otherwise \"icky transitional\" stage my hair is at, which is STILL sticking out like I stuck a fork in an electric socket. It sticks out at a \"longer\" point now (and it's still not long enough to get rid of the ultra wavy either) so it still doesn't look good, but in the ponytail at least it doesn't stick out and look quite so ridiculous. I don't know what made me finally decide to try it -- oh yeah, yesterday just before getting into the shower, I found one of my Pack Rat's ponytail holders in the bathroom. My Pack Rat is coming over for dinner tomorrow, I'll put it up and see what he thinks of it...or should I say, if he even notices! LOL  Making chicken parmigiana and salad (if I can get up the energy to go to the store) or spaghetti (I already have that in the house). I think it's the ascites, not the new chemo (yet?) which is making me tired -- it's back to always being in the way, \"juggling\" my insides when I walk, being short of breath -- exactly the same as the first time, which was before I started the oral chemo. Tomorrow though, I'm supposed to ramp up the cyclophosphamide from half a pill to a whole pill daily, since the first week has passed and I was able to handle it (with the help of one or two daily Compazines). Well...we'll see..... My little grape tomatoes have been REALLY yummy as they've ripened (waay better than the ones I was buying in the store), the cucumbers came out yummy too. Think I'll be pulling the last of the carrots up soon too. If I'm not too wiped to go to the store and buy salad stuff (lettuce and celery anyway), I'll pull 'em tomorrow to put in the dinner salad (along with the last cucumber and a few more of my little tomatoes). Gotta go.... ",

Eventually a hematologist even confirmed my blood clot was from the Tamoxifen. Looks like you and I are the April 2009 Queens of Side Effects. Your research result on the surgery looks thorough enough (but so did having two doctors tell ME a BMX and radiation would work for me for several months and only a few days out of rads the skin mets are back...ehhh, OK, so they meant well, I'll have to give 'em that much)....I hope you turn out better than I did is all I can say!! Judy and Helen -- My ponytail is still short (my old one went halfway down my back)...I don't actually like it, I only think it might occasionally be the lesser of the two evils until my hair is ALL at MINIMUM a few inches past my shoulders and/or long and heavy enough to be only a little bit wavy like it used to be. I never followed or cared about fashion though. I'll tell you all now, I'd MUCH rather wear something 40 years out of date (presuming I even KNEW it was out of date LOL) that makes *ME* like what I see in the mirror than something I'm told OTHERS consider current and/or and stylish.  Of course if I actually KNEW what was current, somehow had an opportunity to try it and discovered I thought it looked good on me, I'd wear it, but let's just say I don't pay attention and don't give a donkey's butt to be fashionable unless *I* like how it looks on me. And I don't like how I look in either ponytails or short hair. Never did. OK so, hmmm....Betsy, Helen AND Amy all have doctor appointments NEXT Wednesday? I do too, but next Wednesday (so far) is just counseling (but my psychologist is a Ph.D. so she's a doctor LOL). Tomorrow is counseling at 11, vampire at 2:15 and oncologist at 3. Boy am I going to be worn out from hell when I get home from all that. Oh yeah -- I'm under the care of mental health professionals, and see, I'm STILL a complete mess and total wacko? LOL Helen -- YUP on those tomatoes!!  :-) Amy -- maybe Betsy will ask her onc about if Tamoxifen caused the endometrial cancer. Then again, if her med onc took her off the Tamox upon discovery of this awful diagnosis, he probably does think the Tamox had something to do with it. My onc immediately took me off the Tamoxifen when he found my blood clot (on a scan for my CANCER!). So even it it took awhile before I actually saw a hematologist, I was definitely not shocked to hear her confirm Tamox as the reason why I had that blood clot. And -- update -- no Pack Rat and no chicken parmigiana for dinner tonight. At about 10:30-something this morning (Tues morning), my whole town and part of one of the neighboring towns went offline in a power failure. Power didn't come back till around midnight (it's about 1 AM right now). I need electric equipment to make chicken parmigiana (my stove and toaster oven are both electric, unfortunately: I wish I had a gas range, a nice old one that fires up without electricity like my last stove)... I was totally prepared -- if I absolutely had to, I could live for at least a week alone and with no power, so for me the approximately 10 hour power outage was just an inconvenience. While I could still see (before it got dark: I had no idea how long this was going to last), I set up my camping stove on the counter -- so I had hot soup for dinner (NE clam chowder). I did actually get something done today that I'd been putting off for months (going through my receipt envelopes and calculating my actual expenses); took me 4 hours but I did it. Yup, I gotta cut down. Now if I could only decide where. The only place I can really see as maybe a little easy-ish to cut is communications (go back to cheap dialup internet or get rid of my land line and only use my TracFone) but it's frustrating because it's only a couple hundred bucks a month I need to save to keep my present communications setup which I like. Well anyhoo, also I did some additional math (pulling numbers from old checkbook registers from 2009-2010) to roughly compare previous (NJ) expenses with current (NH) ones. I was wondering if it was more expensive to run ACs all summer in that hot, humid and hideous upstairs apartment I used to live in or to heat THIS place in the winter (nope: heating this place is considerably costlier) and a couple other things (I do make out like a bandit here on car insurance, if nothing else!). Well, it kept me entertained anyway, mostly. But, I digress. In light of the power failure, me and my Pack Rat rescheduled our date for tomorrow evening, which is Hump Day anyway so it kinda works out. If I'm too wiped out to cook from spending most of the day at the medical center, though, we'll be going out. I just hope I'm not feeling too yucky for the traditional Hump Day festivities. ;-) Well...gotta go catch up on my Gloom & Doom (the news) since I had no Internet today. See you all next time.",

Finished my last scan today (PET) and I'm \"free\" until Sept 10th, at which time I get to see my oncologist and get the bad news, er, scan results, and find out what horrors he'll suggest next.    Titan -- Yes, I got to have SEX (saying it loud and proud) when my Pack Rat was here!  :-D I even had the energy to ravish him a bit too, not to mention the coming like a freight train part. Woo-HOO!  I'm still going to pass on the \"dog thing\" with regards to my Mycelium Head -- since the growth is colorless and isn't easy to see (except in the bathroom under the only bright light I've got), I did tell him to put his hand on my head so he could feel it, but once was enough. No car windows for me because I will NOT open my apt door bareheaded until my hair is AT LEAST DOWN TO MY SHOULDERS, much less go outside in public like that. I hated it that I \"had to\" go bareheaded in front of my Pack Rat because it was too hot/humid to wear my scarf (but when we did the laundry and went outside a couple times, I did put my wig on for THAT).    So your husband thinks you're SEXY bald? (and yours does too, Linda?) Well, that's good! Truth be told, while my Pack Rat is very physically affectionate (hugs, kisses and cuddles a lot even when he's NOT trying to have sex), he's not at all one for VERBAL affection. Even before I got cancer, he never once said to me, \"You're beautiful\" or \"You're sexy.\" If I ever complained about anything about my looks he'd exclaim \"You're way too critical!\" and there was the one time when we were in bed and he ran his hand up one of my legs, grinned, and said \"do these go on forever?\" But that's the closest he ever got to TELLING me I was beautiful or sexy. So since the cancer, when I'd say my baldness makes me hideous, his comments are \"you're way overreacting, it's not nearly as bad as you think.\"  I figure, he MUST have considered me beautiful and sexy before cancer because he would touch and hold me whether he was trying to get me into bed or not (and since he'd initiate too, it's not like he ONLY slept with me when I initiated it), and since that didn't change after I lost my hair, I guess he must still think so...   Linda -- Obviously I got \"brave\" this weekend too, going openly bald in front of my Pack Rat like that (the only time I covered my head was when we left the apt, but indoors I was always bareheaded), but I honestly wouldn't have been so \"brave\" if it had been cool enough to wear my scarf.    This hair thing kind of brings me to a bit of a longish story (those of you who like my writing, thanks for the compliment, and, you'll enjoy this...those of you who are too polite to tell me I'm a longwinded bore can simply skip on to the next person's post LOL)...   I had a little bit of an adventure Friday afternoon (which is why I'm amazed I had energy for the sex LOL). I went to the supermarket, complimenting myself on the way down there that I timed it well (i.e., going before the traffic got bad and still being able to get home in time for a good parking spot), and I didn't even get too confused while shopping (the last time I was at a grocery store I spent 20 mins trying to figure out if \"granulated garlic\" was the same thing as \"garlic powder\" since they didn't have either my usual brand of garlic powder or any other brands of \"garlic powder\" in the size I like to buy: only the \"granulated garlic\" was in the right size). So this time was going kind of well. They were even selling umbrellas, too, and I needed a new one so I bought a couple of them actually. But then, while at the checkout, as soon as I finished paying, I hear a huge thunderclap, look up at the window, and the sky has opened up and it's POURING!   And that's when I lose my mind and the chemo brain kicks back in. I'm thinking for a split second \"it's OK, I have an umbrella now,\" but it's not just raining, but DOWNPOURING, and I have enough groceries to load up the trunk, and I realize there's no way I can hold the umbrella over my head and push the shopping cart all the way to my car, much less hold it while I unload the stuff into the trunk, not to say anything about getting the stuff into the apartment once I get home -- and I also think about how my wig will be totally ruined if I let it get more than drizzled on -- horrors! So, I got out of the way of other shoppers and waited in the store for about 20-30 mins for the downpour to slow to a very light drizzle. Thank goodness it did, for long enough to get to the car, load up the trunk, put the cart away and start to drive home. As soon as I get out of the supermarket parking lot though, the rain picks back up and the downpour resumes. I got a good parking spot when I got home, but it was still downpouring and I realize I'd put the umbrellas IN THE TRUNK with the food! So I sit in the car for 20 mins hoping it'll slow down again, only it doesn't. But I have to get the stuff upstairs -- the majority of it is for the freezer and it was 90-something and humid out...   Finally I pop the hood of the trunk (and unlock the rear door on the driver side for the \"old lady cart\" I use to bring groceries from the car to the apt building, run out and bring the bag with the umbrellas into the car, calm down and pull out an umbrella. Boy they sure don't make umbrellas like they used to! Why the fuck do they have to package them up in plastic and crap? Is somebody going to eat them and ingest cyanide or something?! And what happened to that nice easy \"thumb thingie\" to open and close them? Took me ten minutes to figure out how to get the packaging off and then get the umbrella to open!   Obviously I got the umbrella open, managed to get the trunk unloaded and the groceries upstairs, and NOT get my wig messy awful rained on and ruined. You know, if I had my real hair (or perhaps wasn't embarrassed as all hell at the thought of being bald in public), I wouldn't have minded -- I'd have actually enjoyed it!  In fact, I remember a day when I was working at this major pharmaceutical company, a hot summer day just like Friday, cloudy with a \"chance\" of rain, and that day I hadn't brought an umbrella to work with me. It didn't rain all day, until I got off work -- the moment I was about to walk out the door, the sky opened up and there was a tremendous downpour (exactly like what I saw at the supermarket checkout). So I stand there for a moment, no umbrella, my car is parked about half a mile away (really! ISYN! huge company, multibuilding \"campus\" setup, huge distant parking lots), and I KNOW I'm going to get totally drenched -- so I decided I may as well enjoy it! I walked out the door and had FUN stomping in the puddles like a little kid, all the way out to the car! It rained like that for my whole commute, and when I got home, you know what I did? Ran up to my apartment, grabbed rags and dish soap, went back out, washed my car and thought if not for the fact that it's illegal to be naked outside, it would've been fun to take a SHOWER in the rain too!   Yup, fog's clearing a bit.  This evening, I actually began to look into what it would take for me to do a Sims hack one of my favorite artistic creators requested a couple months ago, and I've got an IDEA on how to do it! Of course it's a tedious idea, and I'm hoping to come up with a better way to do it, but if I can STAY FOCUSED ON THE DETAILS, I can pull it off...it'll be inelegant but it'll do what she wants it to do. I'd really like to make this for her because stuff she made was what made my theme game possible in the first place. Our talents are different -- she's artistic, I'm a hacker with no artistic talent. Meaning she deals with designing and appearances, while I deal with functions and motives (the innards/how it works/what it does). She's too caught up in her artistic creating to have time to get seriously into hacking, so that's why she'd posted on one of the Sims forums, \"Need a Hacker.....\" and requested this object, and said if anyone could make it, she'd jump for joy! She's been making ME jump for joy for three years now, so I'd really love to be able to accommodate her.   hrf -- Maybe you need to haunt the Hormonal Treatment area of the forum, I'm sure there must be women on Arimidex who can tell you if eyebrow/eyelash loss is an Arimidex SE and what it does to hair.....and definitely I think you should ask your oncologist about that when you next see him/her.   Pam -- that's great! :-)   Geri -- yikes, you're STILL doing your chemo? Oh wow! I hope you're feeling OK.   OK, gotta go now... time to take my evening meds...   ~Lena.",

I suppose since I'm back on chemo that's why they totally refreshed my supplies of Zofran and Compazine, but in addition to using them on past and present Chemo Days I've also successfully used it against nausea from my pain medicines too since they sometimes make me a little queasy -- Compazine is actually enough for this so I reserve the Zofran for Chemo Days now.

Like she doesn't have ENOUGH frickin recovering to do WITHOUT that?! EEEEEEEEEEEESH! Uh-HUH. Right.  Titan -- LOL maybe you WOULD be thinking a 10:30 AM drink was a pretty good idea if you were having surgery? My surgeons always beat me to that, though. Either they schedule me \"too early\"  or they put me on that \"No eating or drinking after midnight\" regimen which kind of saves me from myself? LOL Amy -- I've read about women whose brains were fine while they were ON their chemo, but yeah, like you, a few years down the road, turned into functional retards (and this was the type I feared I'd end up with when I was about to decline treatment! WTF is this years AFTER shit?!). Unfortunately my own retardation commenced while I was on mine, and I don't think those lost marbles will ever be back. Your type of chemo brain is every bit as legit as anyone else's as far as I'm concerned. And thank you for all the Betsy updates. You'll have to keep her under surveillance for all of us until she can get back in here and speak for herself. Helen -- life is what happens while you're not paying full attention. (Can I start over as 19 again too? I can't handle a whole half-century!)  Geri -- :-O :::::faints:::::   ::picks herself up from off the floor:::::   you thought I was going to propose to my Pack Rat, who broke up with my predecessor as much for her claim to want to get married as her issues with fidelity (as in, fidelity was not one of her values -- so why would a woman who didn't believe in being faithful to her mate be pestering him to MARRY her?! Well he apparently really does NOT want to be married, for real, because I NEVER had a problem with being faithful, he knew that and still he never proposed to me (even when I was healthy and we could conceivably have had a future together). I have to also admit I was less than enthusiastic about the idea of marriage due to my divorce (3 years after the divorce was when I got fixed up with the Pack Rat). I loved my former husband when we were dating, living together, engaged, and married -- we split up because he had an affair (which, since I still felt in love with him, left me totally poleaxed). And I had NOT been young and/or impulsive when I chose my husband (who was a man my age) -- I was 31 when we met, 33 when we moved in together, engaged at 34 and 35 when we got married. Three years later he takes up with the little sister of the girl he dated when when he was 18 -- now that she was 24 instead of 4! So some kinds of decisions, no matter how careful I am, I just can't trust myself to be able to make, and marriage is one of them. So yeah, I'm going to propose to a man who doesn't even WANT to be married! -- NOT --   It's nitey-nite time, so here's a well-wish for Betsy's healing and maybe tomorrow I'll tell you how I almost just died again (Friday late night through Monday night). ",

Then I thought maybe the sweatshirt itself would be too warm because I was going to be pretty active, so I continue to muse about my winter hats, which I own ONLY because here in the Frozen Northeast, it gets subzero and windy in the winter, and I get earaches when it's cold and windy unless I wear a hat -- but I ended up deciding to just put the darn wig on! I'll bet nobody would have thought I looked too strange if I'd have worn one of my winter hats, and my less than one inch long hair is all stuck up and impossibly horrid looking ANYWAY (I hated hat-weather days because, yes, they messed up my hair!).....eh but I hate the cold....today wasn't cold enough for either that sweatshirt or a winter hat though -- winter coat and scarf was enough.

My Pack Rat drags me to his family (THEY celebrate) but I just look at it as, \"we're going to spend time with my Pack Rat's parents\" (or his aunt: we visit her too) -- not \"we're celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with them.\"  So yes, my Pack Rat was here and we did our usual visiting, but this year the hot flashes totally ruined it for me. I was so disgustingly uncomfortable and, unlike when I'm at home, I couldn't take my wig off or change into something lighter. I had to keep running outside to cool off and missing good parts of interesting conversations (I may not be a holiday person, but I do like my Pack Rat's family, a lot, save one cousin who was thankfully not there). My Pack Rat returned to his Nest in the North on Wednesday afternoon, but, even if he'd been here, well, neither one of us cares to be out on New Year's Eve (too many police, too many drunk drivers) and his family doesn't do anything for New Year's anyway. In fact, in the 7 years we've been in this relationship (our \"anniversary\" was 12/28) we've never spent New Year's Eve or New Year's Day together. So I didn't do anything \"special\" last night (I wasn't even in the mood for a glass of wine!), and today is just like any other, except I don't have to play Friday Musical Cars. :-) If you celebrate, I hope your holidays were good.  ~Lena. ",

Though, Judy, I don't think ANYTHING will ever \"compensate\" for being diagnosed and then going into treatment for this disease! I wouldn't even know where to start to try. But, that's just me. Titan, Amy and Judy, you can add me to the list of weight-gainers. GRRR! >:-P At the time I was diagnosed, and all the way through chemo (the April - July 6 rounds of TAC), I was at the top end of what I didn't mind living with in terms of my weight (Midsection from Hell). That is to say, IDEALLY, I'd have weighed ~125 instead of ~135 and NOT been thick through the middle, but I was still able to accept and tolerate my body as it was. Once in a very blue moon, I could even look at my body and think that for a woman my age (to me 40+ is \"old\"), it wasn't too terrible even. But NOW? UGGGH! I am a fat DISGUSTING SLOB, which is like adding insult to the injury of the ugly short-hairedness, and yes, this is contributing to my not being able to stand the sight of myself. Of course in my case I don't know if it's Tamoxifen or \"quit smoking\" weight...but it's there, and naturally it all piled up on the one and only place on my whole body that I'm fat -- my Midsection from Hell. Actually, I think it's mostly quit smoking weight, because for the first time I can remember in my adult life, I picked up a nasty little habit of \"comfort eating\" which I don't recall ever having when I used to smoke. They sell these mini-muffins at my supermarket's bakery section (corn, blueberry, banana nut) which I really like but (up till recently) would only rarely buy. Well, I started buying them again my last few trips to the supermarket, and while I originally used to buy them at intervals of once a month to 6-8 weeks to bring in to work \"for everybody\" in my department (so I myself would only eat a couple of them) and then once in awhile when my Pack Rat was visiting (he likes the banana nut ones), NOW, here I go like a pig: I can eat through a whole package of 20 mini-muffins in 3 or 4 days! :-O I don't have a scale here, but I get weighed every time I go to the oncologist's, and while I stayed in the ~135 range on chemo and even on Tamoxifen before I stopped smoking, at my last onc appointment (1/5/10) the number on the scale was 150 -- take off 3 pounds for the winter clothes I was all bundled up in so I weigh 147. UGGGGH! And it looks DISGUSTING, I can SEE it every time I take off my clothes to get in the shower! ::::shudder:::: And I better stop talking about these damn muffins not just because I should \"stop\" eating them, period, but also because I have a PET scan today and not only am I totally \"off\" from not being allowed to have my morning coffee, but I sure as hell CAN'T have a muffin either. ~Lena.",

MY Pack Rat doesn't play, watch or even care about sports of any kind (thank goodness since I do too) -- and other than the occasional movie or Star Trek DVD, neither of us watch any TV either. He actually is a \"prepper\" though -- before I met him I was \"organized,\" yes, but he was a \"bad influence\" on me so that's when I started the \"always be prepared for an emergency\" thing.  The problem with him though, is that he is NOT organized and he does his prepping mostly as he goes -- he plans NOTHNG and is the kind who is totally brilliant (he's a mechanical designer/inventor with several patents), as long as you NEVER expect him to know what time it is or what day of the week it is. If he had to go to the hospital or have an incapacitating treatment like mine, no he wouldn't think or plan to spend his last couple of days shopping or cleaning -- when he's out out running his usual errands, he stops in the store and buys more stuff to add to the stockpile. Unless he comes to my house and I cook for him, he doesn't do the fresh fruits, salads and dairy thing; he's happy with canned, frozen and dry. My own stockpile of that stuff, thanks to his influence, is such that if I was willing to forego fresh fruit, salad and dairy and ONLY eat from cans, jars, with rice and pasta, I would not have to go to a food store AT ALL for eight or nine months -- and this is right now, today, with no notice and at a time when due to my recent BMX, other illness and rads I did lean a bit on my stockpile and should replace what I used (that's the plan when enough of the fatigue lifts that I'm motivated to do it). Not surprisingly, he doesn't actually care if his house is clean either so he wouldn't bother with that -- MAYBE he'd give his cousin's daughter a few bucks and ask her to do it, but even that is just a maybe. LOL, I know he's a man, but I'm a woman and housecleaning isn't MY top priority either -- yeah I wash dishes, do laundry and take the trash out regularly, but I only do the total \"top to bottom\" house cleaning -- sweeping, vacuuming, clean the bathroom sink/tub/toilet, clean the stove/kitchen counters and mopping the bathroom and kitchen floors once a month to month and a half (when I'm well enough. I know, when is THAT? LOL). I take ONE DAY to clean the house good enough so it won't be physically impossible to do it well enough next time, in one day, to keep it just clean enough to not attract bugs -- and then not have to do it again until the next month to month and a half! I like CLEAN, but I hate TO clean. In my nefarious youth, I was quite an infamous slob; I could have taught Oscar Madison a FEW lessons! If I'd been able to clean the house the day before rads as planned, I'd have been close to \"on schedule,\" but my kidneys decided otherwise so didn't quite work out that way. Still, it's only just NOW (the last few days) -- having not cleaned at all other than doing dishes, laundry and taking garbage out for I think pushing 3 months now -- have I even STARTED noticing it beginning to actually look dirty, such things as, \"gee, I should really sweep the bedroom floor and stairs/vacuum the computer and living room carpet/mop the kitchen and bathroom floors\" and \"oh wow, I should really clean that stove!\" I don't have the energy yet though, I'm still pretty wiped from the rads (it's been only 2 weeks since last treatment). But I digress. If my Pack Rat knew he was going to have to go to the hospital or have some kind of debilitating medical procedures, most likely be spending, as you put it, his last \"healthy days,\" working on the diesel Samurai he's custom building, or maybe working on the Volkswagen or the Thirsty Truck, or doing Internet research (science and economics mostly) or perhaps catching up on his various survivalist blog and forum site readings. Ehhh, no, he'd probably just work on the vehicles, since he knows he could always go online with his laptop if he had to be in the hospital and park his butt in front of the computer do his Internet research and reading while recovering at home and being too tired to do anything else. (or maybe he'd be here, lying in my bed or on my couch with his laptop, with me feeding him of course.) Who knows....well he does help me when I need it, and I'd help him too. I should add that since the rads started sucking my energy like a vampire, he has been taking me out or running out to get us pizza when I've been too tired to cook. Oh, in case I didn't tell you -- both of us are weird!   :-} Together now for a total of just over 8.5 years now (the LDR had been going on for 6 years by the time of my diagnosis) -- 12/28-29/11 will make it 9 if I live that long.",

Trouble is, I couldn't decide which one to tell -- mainly because I'm too upset to focus on anything cheerful. So, I'll leave it up to you to decide.  So girls, pick one story from the upcoming list and I'll tell it to you If I was going to write a book of this stuff (I'm NOT), these would have to be included in Chapter One, which would have to be called,  \"They (My Parents) Let Me LIVE?\" Yeah I did much more than this but these are just the ones that come to the top of my chemobrain damaged head... a. \"Are you a Man or a Lady?\" b.  \"Sharks and Bumblebees\" c.  \"Just Plain Gross -- The Best Kind of Fun!\" d. \"Ketchup and Tampon Sandwich\" e. \"Hell Hath No Fury as a Teenager Scorned\" f. \"The Writing on the Wall\"  g. Dr. Demento--a Live Performance\" h. \"Don't Get Mad -- Get EVEN!\"  Okay, there's good news and bad news: good news: my Pack Rat called me last night. During the course of our chat, he says his workplace is closed on Friday -- asks if I'd be interested in a visit this weekend. I say yes. He'll be here Thursday night.  The bad news: I'm still ON the friggin Lovenox shots and will have to STAY on them until my platelets \"come up\" to normal. My platelets, as of yesterday's blood test, are dangerously low at 46. \"Coming up\" means they have to be in the normal range, which is between 130-400!!!!!!!!! Yesterday they handed me a schedule for the next SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS of having to go in and get those horrible shots! I lost it and I burst into tears. I don't know what the problem is but my blood is TOTALLY messed up of late. Not only are my platelets too low, but so are both my white and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit. I wonder if that's got anything to do with why my joints are, and have been so stiff (since a few days of getting these shots, it hurts to get up and down, to walk, to get in and out of a car or van). But can I ask my oncologist about this? No, because he's out all week, so I'll have to wait until my next regular appointment (4.5.10).  Good luck on your surgery tomorrow Geri. I'm cranky right here with you, only in my case it's the shots, not surgery. Betsy, I'm still whiny and tired too. Maybe that's why I'm extra-upset over the shots...  Titan -- Oh, I'm so with you -- ever since I did chemo, whenever I see another woman \"out there\" with really super short hair, I wonder if it's because she had chemo...I still can't imagine why anybody who was HEALTHY would CHOOSE to have their hair THAT short! And I'm noticing more and more such super short-haired women out here of late. Even though I'd fit in with them NOW, I STILL don't go out topless because I think I'm way too UGLY with my hair this short. Yes I remember what it was like being on chemo -- no way could I have worked while on it -- I was like Judy (useless, brain dead and depressed). OK gotta go... ~Lena. ",

That's how all my \"regularly scheduled\" scans work -- I get sent for PET, CT and Bone scans every few months -- if nothing's wrong nothing is mentioned until my actual oncologist appointment. If something IS wrong, the doctor calls me. A weirdness on my last CT and PET scans made him call me to get an MRI which is how I found out about the blood clot, which is why I was told to stop taking Tamoxifen, then had special clotting panel blood tests, the Lovenox injections then put on Coumadin and being forced into taking the damn Femara (now Aromasin) for cancer control. Anyhoo -- hopefully it's all still quiet for you, no call from the doctor so you can enjoy your weekend. And yeah, wow, you sure do have a lot of hair. Way more than me. Oh, mine covers my whole head at least, but still isn't long enough to cover my ears. Oh my, here we go again...No, I don't live in Florida. I live in New Jersey (:::::shudder:::::). And didn't I mention that I wasn't into traveling when I was healthy? That's why I told you all to go on ahead and just make whatever traveling plans you all want to do, without me, the last time this idea came up. Hmmm. OK, so what else is going on here.... Judy, sounds like you're doing good. That's cool!  :-) So your birthday is coming up? When is it? Well in case I miss it, happy birthday in advance! Geri, so your BF is 7 years younger than you? Woo-HOO. I'm a cradle robber too; my Pack Rat is 4 years younger than me, and I'm sure he didn't sign up for a girlfriend with cancer either. Anyway...about that \"raising the flag issue\" -- dare I ask if you've, um, done anything special to help him along, if you know what I mean? When I wear out my Pack Rat really bad (but have energy for more), for instance, I find that when I eat him alive, he does just fine.  ;-) And I like to eat Pack Rat sausage anyway -- it's my favorite food! Heh heh heh. Oh, and one more thing..maybe my Pack Rat's libido is generally higher than your boyfriend's, but, my Pack Rat is at a distance, his lifestyle is ultimate chaos, and we don't get together that often (average is every 6-8 weeks), so maybe by then he's just so totally sex-starved, you know? He came with me for my first chemo infusion, but not for any of my other treatments, scans or anything, although we talk on the phone a couple times a week between visits and he's up to date and 'with me' concerning my condition, treatment, etc. You know, a few visits back I actually suggested to him that maybe I ought to let him go so he could find someone young, pretty and healthy -- and do you know what he said? \"What would I want to do THAT for?\" Titan - well in MY opinion, that Pack Rat is the sexiest creature on this entire planet. How are you feeling now?  Happy birthday Betsy! :-) Hmmm, OK...I'm five days on the Aromasin...joints ache like worse crap, feet really hurt when i get out of bed in the morning (and sweating with the hot flashes is worse), but, so far, none of the suicidally depressed mood swings and crying fits, and except the other day when it was really hot and humid, I'm still able to take my daily walks. They make me tired and I can't seem to make it up to the next level (3 full circuits of the lake in the park: I'm still \"stuck\" at 2) yet, but on the other hand, today I did laundry in the morning AND went to the supermarket -- instead of driving I walked, so I walked almost 4 miles today. But of course I passed out on the couch for about an hour once I got home and ate lunch. And, another Sims modder is making me some new skins, special, for my theme game.  Also I have to design my own diet to lose this frickin weight -- all the diets already out there send me into fits of depression when I read about them because they list foods I don't like, foods I've never even heard of, foods I don't know how to cook, require spending money and so on, so I'm working on that too; I've been keeping records of what I eat and looking up how many calories in it...so I'm going to go on a diet, but it's going to have to be one for ME, based on what I like to eat and how I cook, and not cost me any more money than what I'd spend buying food anyway. I have no past experience with dieting because I was never fat enough to really need it until now. All I had to do before was just not wear bathing suits or midriff-revealing clothes, and I was fine! LOL. Oh, and you know that Italian dinner I made last Saturday for me and my Pack Rat?  (1 green, 1 red, 1 orange and 1 yellow pepper, plus 2 onions, 2 potatoes and 4 links of sweet Italian sausage, all sauteed in olive oil, with garlic powder and oregano) I had bought enough to make it TWICE, so I'm having it tonight, too. Believe it or not, it isn't that fattening -- I was shocked when I toted up its calories earlier this week, but the recipe (1236 calories total) is good for 4 servings, 309 calories per serving. So I'm off to cook it up, eat one serving tonight and have the rest as leftovers over the next few days. I found out that it goes beautifully with an egg for breakfast too (that's what I did with the leftovers from Sat night).  Have a good weekend, all -- and don't do anything I wouldn't....  ~Lena. ",

Amy -- Yeah, I know what you mean about being dubious concerning being \"cured\" -- but for everyone in here except me, at least it's POSSIBLE. How's the exercising going, dare I ask? (OMG, did I just use the \"E-word\"? LOL) My original \"E\" program -- the walking, which is the only kind of E I can physically do (unless molesting a Pack Rat counts, but that would be the \"F-word\" which is a lot more fun than the \"E\" word) -- is still on hold due to bad leg (more on THAT momentarily GRRRR!)... Judy -- that's terrible about your friend with the leukemia. :-( Please accept my sincerest condolences. And wow, you actually have enough confidence in your body to wear a bathing suit in public? I'm floored -- I can't even IMAGINE what it's like to like my body anymore. The times I considered my body even \"just OK\" were few and far between anyway (once upon a time I had a beautiful face and beautiful hair, but only a so-so body at best)...this has nothing to do with the breast cancer or my unprecedented weight gain this year, just my original 10 extra pounds in the middle and shapeless Midsection from Hell. That's what motivated me to throw out the couple of one piece bathing suits I had when I was in my 20s and despite the otherwise less than bathing suit quality body, I did have a perfectly acceptable matching set of 34Cs. Now that I'm ugly old and fat and have the misshapen cancerous right breast on top of it, well forget it. Betsy -- what are \"Ya Ya Sisters\"? Glad you had fun, though and you got what you needed for your art project. :-)  Alaina -- it's good to hear your aunt is doing OK. Geri -- good luck Monday with your next to last Herceptin. Or is Monday your ALMOST next to last treatment?  OK...wait till you hear THIS one... last Saturday I had an appointment at the hospital radiology department to get my right leg MRI'ed. I called the taxi at a time where I'd show up at the hospital about 5-10 mins early (this is my usual procedure). However, the taxi was late -- I was standing outside waiting for 45 mins in oven type heat, or should I say what passes for standing  when your leg/knee hurts like effin' hell cause the painkiller takes too long to kick in. And had to call the cab company back too (the cab broke down and they had to find another one to send to me!). By the time I got there turns out I missed my appointment -- so all that miserable waiting for the cab was for nothing. I was LIVID, I just totally lost it, as in I had a temper tantrum fit to do a 2-year-old proud in public. When I got back upstairs to the lobby and called the cab company to send someone to pick me up and get me home, I complained about their lateness making me miss my appointment and told them I wanted the ride home to be FREE. Thank goodness, they didn't charge me for the ride home. However, my effin' brain is still dead, screw this Aromasin crap which is almost as bad as chemo -- as in why didn't I ALSO think to ask for a refund of my fare TO the hospital? EEEESH! The good news is that on Sunday, my leg started to feel better, I didn't need to take as much of the oxycodone. On Monday it actually felt OK enough to (very carefully) do laundry and on Tuesday (very carefully) go to the supermarket (a small trip: all I got was a half gallon of milk, fresh fruit and salad stuff). The oven weather cooled down and it got real nice this week, and although my leg is still nowhere near good enough where I'd even try to resume my daily exercise walks in the park or do errands of any kind on foot, I was OK to bring my iBook and play Sims in the park a couple times during the week. And...Thursday I saw the psychiatrist. Wow, he had actually run printouts of the stuff I emailed him and while I was there looked up and read about the SAMe (too bad my oncologist doesn't see any value in a doctor-patient \"team\" approach but OK). He says he doesn't think all my dopamine cells are dead (which I was afraid of from my month on Femara) -- but we'll find out. He put me on the antidepressant Welbutrin (which is dopaminergic and does not have sexual side effects of any kind). He also prescribed Lunesta for my sleep issues. So far -- I haven't been taking the Welbutrin long enough to notice anything, but I think the Lunesta, so far, is slightly better than the Ambien CR. I mean, I still woke up in the middle of the night, but only ONCE, not the usual 2-3 times. Lastly...\"diet\" is DIE with a \"t\" -- but, 5 pounds down, 25 to go....I wonder if I'll live long enough to lose it or why it even matters, but somehow it does, just as much as the hair which I know I'll never live long enough to grow all the way back.... Well, think I'm gonna go Sim before bed...take care everyone, have a good weekend.  ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Jul 12, 2010 10:18AM - edited Jul 12, 2010 01:54PM by Lena Hi again all. Crap almighty Helen! I wish I knew what I could say to you -- if that's even POSSIBLE --  to make you feel better about your man leaving you because of the breast cancer. Just saying \"that really effin' SUCKS\" may be true, and that's what I think of it, but doesn't really soothe your hurt feelings, I'm sure. :-*(  I guess only a hug would work, but only for about 15 seconds, right?  {{{{{Helen}}}}} And yeah, I totally know about feeling too old and ugly to try to find someone new (and better!). Hell, I only got my Pack Rat because *I WAS FIXED UP WITH HIM* -- I had already totally given up on finding a new man when I was \"only\" 40, I still had my long hair, the matching set of 34Cs, and I was \"only\" 10 pounds overweight which I was able to dress to hide easily (meaning, I was still kinda cute!). I was so totally not looking for a new man then, because I was stuck on the idea, thanks to my ex-husband who cheated on me with a 24-year-old girl when we were 38 (that's why I divorced him, cheating is a dealbreaker for me) -- that if a woman was not already married or in an otherwise serious relationship before she was 40, her love life would be over for good: at 40 or older she would be too old to attract a new man (unless she was one of those rare birds who somehow looked like an ex-supermodel LOL); even men my age obviously preferred much younger women so it seemed (although I didn't join or contact anybody, out of curiosity since my co-writer at the time had met her husband through online dating, I looked at a couple online dating websites and that was the impression I got from the men who were listed, plus, the guys I worked with at the time were total pigs in that regard too (i.e., a woman who wasn't young and pretty wasn't worth it). So I'd go to work, and with the occasional exception of hanging around with my friend Kym and her husband every few weeks or so, stayed hiding out in this apartment writing sci fi fantasy novels for no other reason than my need to do something creative and enjoy myself, since I had to give up composing/recording music which had formerly served that purpose. So if I felt my love life was over for good when I was \"only\" 40 and still kinda cute at least, I totally know I wouldn't be able to look for a man either if I had very little hair, no breasts and was overweight too. When I was 41, Kym and her husband fixed me up with this then 37-year-old Pack Rat -- so I got him handed to me on a silver platter. I just got lucky is all. VERY lucky -- putting us together was like tossing a lit match into a puddle of gasoline, and the fire still hasn't gone out.  OMG Geri!! I don't blame you for being pissed. OK, so um, hm, today is the 12th, so TOMORROW is your last Herceptin. OK, guess I'll have to come back in here tomorrow to cheer for you! ;-) Judy -- how's the therapy going and oh geez, I now know about being overwhelmed to tears when a major project comes up (more momentarily). I'm glad you're able to enjoy time with your husband and kids -- I can also enjoy time with my Pack Rat when I get any. But if I can get through with the New Project, there'll be more time with him unless I die even sooner than I think. Alaina -- how's your aunt? Is she still doing well? Betsy -- is it summer for you yet? You can have all my NJ hot and humid if you want...  :::::ducks and runs::::: Amy -- how's the exercise coming? I'm thinking after this week, my leg might be well enough to start walking again. (No hula hoops or cartwheels for me ever, though! And I'll start the walking with a slow build up like when I originally started, have to work my way back up to 2+ miles a day...LOL) But I've been sticking to my diet even though I'm getting discouraged by how slow the weight loss is. I was trying to lose 1 pound per week and at first it was looking that way, but then I'd get 3-4 days in a row when my weight would be the same even though I stayed within my calorie count. My Pack Rat and I did some math this weekend. He even designed me a spreadsheet with formulas and a chart that shows the trend (up or down) based on my actual daily scale weight. So in spite of how slow the numbers seem to be going down when I get on the scale in the mornings, the trend line is still going down, and we calculated my weight loss rate to be one pound every 10 days, and if I keep this up for a year, I'll be down BELOW my goal by 6 pounds. Well, I don't think I need to get all the way down to 119 (but that's about where I was in my late teens and it looked damn good on me); my goal this time has been 125. Well we'll see how it all goes. And maybe if I get back to my exercise walks, the weight loss will go a little faster. Titan --  I'm glad you like your hair, and sorry about your friend's sister just getting diagnosed. Breast cancer SUCKS!!!!! I know, since my posting habits have always been so irregular, I probably shouldn't have to warn you that I may get even MORE irregular for awhile, but, and even though I just started preparations, I don't know how in hell or even IF I'm going to be able to pull this off with my damaged brain, disabled body and just barely enough to live on amount of money, even though my Pack Rat will be helping me when and as he can as Escape Day draws near, BUT.... Yes, I said Escape Day. I'm gonna try to get past the mire of being trapped here...get the hell out of this stinking slum in the armpit of the USA and move up to where my Pack Rat is. My lease with the slumlords here is over as of 10/31/10. What I have to do between now and the last week of October, in addition to trying not to have a nervous breakdown, is (1) figure out how to get medically situated over there in terms of both an oncologist/cancer center and my social security disability income/Medicaid and get that done; (2) inventory and Major Purge to get rid of the stuff I don't \"need\" (i.e.,probably half of my books, records and tapes, the electric piano under the bed (I wanted to get rid of THAT just over a decade ago when I sold off the rest of my instruments and recording equipment but my then-husband insisted I keep it...(um what about \"I had a stroke and my left hand doesn't work well enough to play musical instruments anymore!\" didn't he understand, and why didn't I listen to him and just sell it over his objections?\"), see if I can get rid of some of the clothes too, just whatever it will take to get me pared down enough to not have to pay for a great big expensive moving truck. If I have to, I'll leave all the furniture here, just taking my computers, clothes, dishes, videos, DVD/VHS players/TV set, SOME of my books, SOME of my music, SOME of my knick-knacks (the mad scientist ones). But packing is going to be a major ordeal.... So we did a bunch of Internet research yesterday -- well we both already knew about the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (when we used to talk about my moving up there, he told me about it and said maybe I could get a microbiology lab tech job there), but now we found out they also have the Norris Cotton Comprehensive Cancer Center right there at Dartmouth. So that's my starting point. I had to leave a message with the Care Management social worker I was transferred to when I called up asking how I would go about changing from Trinitas Comprehensive Cancer Center here where I am now, to Norris Cotton if I move to NH. This (the idea of me moving to NH to be closer to my Pack Rat) is something we have on infrequent occasions discussed on and off for several years, which obviously resulted for various reasons at various times, in my continuing to stay here. The idea of him moving to NJ was never an option and I knew that from day one: I accepted it totally because even if I didn't particularly want to live in NH, I still HATE NJ and don't blame anyone for not wanting to live here. Well something he said to me on the phone a couple weeks ago, he meant it to be sympathetic/empathetic for the fact that I've been going through all this cancer and depression stuff mostly all by myself and how hard it must be -- got me to thinking. And when he was here this weekend (yup he was wonderful, he's my PACK RAT...and yes Geri I did keep the skirt on, until he got here and you were right, very shortly thereafter had no more need of it ;-) ) -- well it hit me. I CAN'T do this all alone anymore, and knowing my days are even more numbered than they were before, well I don't want to be so far away from my Pack Rat anymore even if it means I have to move to NH. Oh, NH is beautiful actually, the reason why it was never on my list of \"places I'd like to move to\" was fear of the winters up there. Well I'm still afraid of them, but I realized I'm still afraid of winter here too anyway. At least up there I'll have a nice warm Pack Rat to help me deal with the fearsome winters. OK enough rambling. I need to eat my lunch now, and maybe get the actual number of that social worker (yes I have his name). But there I was this morning with all my notes from yesterday setting up written down stuff to make the call, all freaking out overwhelmed by the Big Project... ~Lena. ",

Well, since I'm here -- now it's time for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Remember last summer that time I went supermarket shopping, it was 90+ degrees out (32+ C, Helen) and just as I finished paying and was about to leave, there was a sudden mysterious out-of-the-blue downpour which lasted 20 mins or half an hour or something like that? And I was afraid to go out in it because I was afraid it would destroy my wig, and then I rambled on about how this one time I had gotten caught in a downpour like that just as I was leaving work one day, I had no umbrella and knew I'd get soaked no matter what so I decided to have fun, and I stomped in the puddles like a 2-year-old and when I got home and it was still downpouring like that, ran up to my apartment, got the dish soap and a rag and washed my car in it? Just before I was about to have lunch today, I happened to look out the window and see one of those sudden downpours starting. Sooo -- I put on my sandals (shoes I don't care if they get soaked), grabbed the dish soap and a rag, went outside, and WASHED MY CAR! I'm serious! I guess if I can't be pretty anymore I can still be a raving psycho, right? As I was coming down the courtyard stairs this guy was walking real fast up the courtyard sidewalk hurrying to the building trying to NOT get soaked, and he gets to see this lunatic woman with stuck-her-fingers-in-the-electric-socket hair, wearing a T-shirt with a huge caffeine molecule on it, blue pants and dirty-white colored sandals, carrying an almost full bottle of Palmolive dishwashing liquid in one hand, and a green towel-rag in the other, stomping in the puddles. Oh, and the timing was so good, too -- just as I was finished with the car wash, the rain slowed down...but I was COMPLETELY soaked. Had to PEEL off my clothes and dry off my whole body with one of the \"shower towels.\" TOTALLY worth it! Maybe next time I'll go out with some shampoo and conditioner. ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Dec 28, 2010 06:09PM - edited Dec 28, 2010 06:10PM by Lena About the snow -- much to my shocked surprise...and I can't believe I'm saying this, but right now NJ snow is WAY worse than NH snow!! Looks like I got out in the nick of time... Did any of you read or see in the news about the blizzard just past how Elizabeth, NJ, which got 31.8 inches of snow when all was said and done -- was the epicenter of the storm? Well, THAT'S WHERE I LIVED when I was in NJ!  :-O And actually we (me and my Pack Rat) were running back UP the east coast north I-95 corridor to I-91 back to NH with that storm only an hour behind us at best. Now what in the hell was THIS all about? My Pack Rat's parents live in Brick NJ and he always allowed himself to be guilted into the Christmas crap -- which he actually hates almost as much as I do; the only difference between us is that I don't feel guilty about saying a loud F-U to Christmas and having blown it off, but he \"can't\" say no to it like I did). Well, I always let him drag me along because time with him is time with him, and I can never have enough of THAT.  And because of the fact that out of our entire choice of vehicles we could take (currently his 1985 turbo diesel Jetta, his 1980-something Chevy S-10 pickup truck, his 1980-something Subaru Samurai, or Shuttlecraft T'Kiri [my 2006 Toyota Corolla]), mine is the most comfortable for a long ride, we go in my car. He does the driving but we make the trip in my car (well, since I got Shuttlecraft T'Kiri, anyway: T'Kiri's predecessors Shuttlecrafts Nevasa and Eridani were about the same ride quality-wise as anything he had, so back then we'd go in whichever of HIS vehicles he had come down in). Well, while I was still living in NJ, he'd arrive at my apt on Christmas Eve, then we'd go down to his folks on the holiday itself, then back to my place that evening and I'd have him anywhere from a couple more days to a week before he went back up north (Thanksgiving schedule similar except the family gathering for that is his aunt's house). Well with both of us up north, it mutated to this: drive down to NJ the day before the holiday, get a hotel room, spend the holiday with his family, go back to hotel that night, breakfast the morning after at the diner with his parents, then we get on the road back to NH after breakfast. So that's what we did, and that's how we ended up driving from NJ to NH with that storm chasing our ass the whole way! It caught up to us somewhere in MA but we made it back before the worst of it. When we got back to my house (Sunday night around 9-something PM), yeah, more \"keeping warm\" was in order (LOL Amy!) although we had \"kept warm\" in the hotel room too. Then yesterday when we got up it was to somewhere between a foot and a foot and a half of snow -- which as you can see was less than the 31.8 inches my former NJ city of residence got hammered with! The driveway had been plowed so \"all\" we had to do was dig out my car -- which we did -- then of course since it was cold outside, we had to warm each other up again....and then I drove him back to his house and came back here myself... my first serious drive on snowy roads in almost a decade! Um hmmm, yeah glad I got the studded snow tires, and like I told him, as long as no one driving behind me cares that my TOP speed in such conditions will only be somewhere between 30-35 mph then OK I can do it (when absolutely necessary), and if they don't like it tough shit!....... I mean yes the plows had been there so it was definitely passable, but there was still more snow than asphalt! After I got back home, well I wasn't going to do this originally -- I mean I am NOT going to be hanging out on the deck in wintertime, y'know? --  but I ended up deciding to shovel and sweep all the snow off the deck (during which time the snowplow guy came up for two more passes of clearing the driveway/parking area) after all. When I got up THIS morning, it was 10:30! I stayed in all day today and was a lazy ass bum! Don't wanna go out again yet but gotta tomorrow...but there hasn't been any more snow and by now all the main roads here are cleared off...was sunny today and is supposed to be sunny for the rest of the week (COLD, but at least no more snow for awhile). Got an appointment tomorrow morning to see if I qualify for heating assistance, and since it's right there, will stop at the supermarket for a couple things on the way home. Tomorrow is also 8 years since my first date with my Pack Rat too. Nice how it falls out on Hump Day this year too! LOL Amy -- you're gonna have to tell us about the weather in Death Valley during winter!  Geri -- that's great about your liver enzymes going back to normal. Judy -- do you have a new oncologist? (did I miss something somewhere down the line?) Oh and wow, looks like your cancer center was different from the one I had chemo at. When I had chemo, all the patients had their own little \"rooms\" (separated by curtains). My Pack Rat came with me for my first treatment and sat in my little \"room\" with me but after that it was just me, my iBook and the nurses coming in to check/change the IV bags. Sometimes I saw or heard other patients had friends or family members in their little \"rooms\" with them, but I was never seated with other patients getting chemo -- so the only BC/chemo patient women I ever \"met\" were you girls here and ones I know on the Stage IV area. Betsy AND Geri -- glad the acupuncture needles aren't hurting you -- maybe you have way higher thresholds of pain than I do! -- and that the treatments are making you feel better. Betsy -- so far I've only switched out those two \"reversed\" kitchen cabinets. Even though I'm still not used to it, that reversal does somehow \"feel better.\" Silverware is still where I originally put it. Titan -- I still don't think having gotten cancer is something to \"celebrate.\" Helen -- did you ask about the hair transplants yet? And oh yeah you got THAT straight about BC not being a distant memory!  :-P OK gotta go now.....catchya next time. ",

UNTIL... THIS PAST MONTH or so!!!!! The other day when I  got up, not only did I finally notice that I'd slept all the way through the night, but realized I couldn't remember having woken up in the middle of the night at all in the past month, other than an infrequent get up and pee, and this time, I also would fall back to sleep on \"pee nights\" (AFTER going to the toilet that is) -- which had NOT been the case in WELL over a year! Of course, I have to \"take drugs\" to do it. Thing is, the drugs are finally WORKING. Last late summer or early fall, I think, I hit on a \"natural\" supplement called Alteril.  It contains L-tryptophan, valerian and melatonin among other things (Amy I'm so glad it helps YOU, but melatonin alone didn't do jack for me when I tried it) -- this combination made me relaxed and sleepy but didn't KEEP me asleep all night -- for that I need prescription stuff. Ambien CR didn't help but Lunesta does. So, if I take an Alteril an hour or 45 mins before I want to go to bed, and then take the Lunesta (and proceed to go to the bathroom, brush my teeth and get in bed) -- I not only fall asleep, but sleep through the night now. Funny you two brought this up TODAY -- my new psychiatrist called this afternoon (she had wanted to talk to my PCP and oncologist before actually putting me on the Ritalin) and in addition to letting me know that they all agree that I can start a small dosage of Ritalin (and us making arrangements for me to pick up the script tomorrow while I'm there for my appointment with the oncologist and another blood draw) -- she asked me how well I was sleeping!  So I told her that I'm FINALLY able to sleep through a whole night, \"except I gotta take drugs to do it!\" and laughed and added \"Well I guess I should just shut up and be grateful I can sleep again AT ALL and never mind how or why!\" and she said what works now isn't necessarily how I'll have to handle it for the rest of my life. But for now this works and we agree I'll keep doing it for now. I found this book in the library on the way home from getting new windshield wipers yesterday. It's called \"Your Brain -- After Chemo (A Practical Guide to Lifting the Fog and Getting Back Your Focus)\" by Dan Silverman, MD and Idelle Davidson. Very very interesting so far. I recommend it.  Well...it's time to make dinner. I'm starved! LOL! ",

LOL Chelev, I made the mistake of starting to go topless last April -- way too soon but we had an early spring 80-degrees heat wave, and I was depressed about the excess 30 pounds on me and felt hideously ugly ANYWAY, so I stopped wearing my wig. I figured if I wasn't going to look nice with it on, I may as well be physically comfortable.  As it happened, after I had lost 25 of the 30 pounds I tried on the wig and I looked 'gorgeous' again -- which is why I'm sorry I took it off so soon!  And you're right, my hair is NOT growing fast enough for me!  It never did, though.  It had taken me ten years to go from bottom of my shoulders to the \"almost to the waist\" length I had before I started chemo. :::::sigh::::: Betsy, I was looking around for other info on the forum but saw some tangential (for me) stuff that made me think of you (and Judy too somehow)... http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/747016?page=1#idx_30 and an excerpt from the \"relevant\" post that caught my eye:     #1. I wear the Bellise compression bra, which is designed to treat women with truncal lymphedema following mastectomy. I do not have any visible swelling or other signs of lymphedema, but the Belisse bra has changed my life! I think the doc at MD Anderson is right on -- he suspects that there is some amount of lymphedema involved with PMPS. You can go to belisse.com to learn about the bra. It needs to be prescribed by a doc.    www.bellisse.com/resources/art...    OK all, hope you're feeling well. :-) ",

Every scan I've had to date since I finished the chemotherapy, from immediate post-chemo to present, has had all nodes clean, even when I still had activity (albeit less than pre-chemo) in my primary tumor and the bone met. The bone met is still dead even though the original primary breast tumor is slightly acting up again. I'm pretty close to certain that if I have a mastectomy (regardless of whether I have a single or double) I'll be issuing these INSISTENT instructions: DO NOT EVEN *THINK* TO TOUCH *ANY* OF MY LYMPH NODES!

For me, the waiting is the GOOD part. I don't mind waiting because so long as I'm waiting, I don't have to make decisions which amount to choosing between Bad vs. Really Bad, or Really Bad vs. I'd Rather Just Die, Please. So what I hate is GETTING the results, not waiting for them. So Helen, since you're also in a cold climate area, are you also getting snowed on today? We're supposed to get 6-10 inches. I think there's approximately 3 inches so far, but of course it's still coming down and will KEEP coming down all day and into the evening, more likely overnight. The only good thing I'll say about it is thank goodness I DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT IN IT. Hope you all feel as well as you can and have a good weekend...and stop worrying about me like I'm a little kid, OK?!  Guess I better resign myself to the idea that there is no such thing as Spring in New Hampshire, any more than there is such a thing as cure at Stage IV. But didn't I already know that?  Oh yeah...forgot to convert, sorry Helen: 6-10 inches = 16-25 cm. The 3 inches already here = 7.62 cm.",

Hmmm, I SAW cheesecake today, but didn't eat it. I was at the medical center for physical therapy and surgical followup, and geez, remind me to pack and bring a lunch when I have to go up there on a morning when I wasn't hungry at breakfast time -- not because of the cheesecake, and not because I was \"starving\" (they have little food establishments there so there IS food), but because the food there is so EXPENSIVE. Since I wasn't hungry for breakfast, I had to eat at lunch time! I ate between my appointments which were 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM.  But almost FIVE BUCKS for one slice of pizza and over a dollar for one banana? I didn't ask how much one of the slices of cheesecake would have cost, though. I'm saving the Total Cheesecake Pig-out for when me and my Pack Rat do the birthday thing this coming weekend. My birthday is actually on Thursday but he had to work in CT this week. Us not getting to spend my actual birthday together was the price for his being able to rearrange his work schedule so he could take me to and from surgery and be close at hand for the most critical part of my recovery plus drain removal, I guess. But this isn't the first time. In the 7 years we were long distance, we've only spent 4 I think of both mine and his birthdays together COMBINED because the day had to either fall on a weekend or be part of the annual summer week I would go up there (and I missed 2009's because of chemo).  Midweek birthdays we mostly DID have to postpone until the \"closest weekend visit\" either before or after.  Oh, his birthday is in July, so yes, I would try to make my yearly trip around the time of his birthday...but only succeeded twice. Anyhoo. I check out good, i.e. \"on track\" in my recovery, both in terms of my physical range of motion and the healing of the incisions. The physical therapist, who I saw first, \"measured\" my range of motion, then she taught me some very light exercises and deep breathing techniques to go with them, which I need to do twice a day. And yeah I'd been doing a little \"too much,\" she said, when I answered her questions about what activities I could and did do, when I'd started doing them, which were hard or impossible and describing either \"Here's what I did instead so I wouldn't seriously injure myself\" or \"No way, I can't even TRY that yet!\" kind of thing. She said it was okay but it would have been preferable if I'd been a TOTAL slacker for my entire first 3 weeks postop. Well, what's done is done, I guess. I'll try to slack a little more till Friday (my 3 week point) except for when I do the exercises. Our next visit is next week.   The surgical followup was probably more interesting once I got home and read the report. The surgeon gave me the full surgical report with all the \"fun for science geeks\" pathology information -- IMMEDIATELY -- I didn't have to ASK her for it! But we still talked about it once she examined me. She said there had been a LOT more cancer in my body than she'd expected to find (TWO tumors in what had been the 'good' breast that we found the ONE 'new' lump in, and that was just for STARTERS) but she got it \"all\"....well, at least as much as is POSSIBLE to say \"got it all\" when you KNOW it's in the dermal lymphatics (that's what defines IBC as apart from other BCs). She also said she thinks the reduction of that high a tumor burden will make a noticeable difference in QOL as well as increasing survival time -- as in, she said I might even get a noticeable increase in physical energy. Um yeah right we'll see: I haven't HAD physical energy since my stroke!  Then we talked about what I'd just done with the physical therapist and getting those exercises to do. Oh, and, speaking of \"exercise,\" LOL, I mentioned that my Pack Rat and I had celebrated Hump Day last week and in addition to \"good for you!\" she said I might have set a record for earliest post-BMX sex. And now :-{ we come to the What's Next part. :-{ She very strongly encouraged me to have rads. She had MENTIONED rads when we had our pre-surgical discussion and she examined me for the first time, but it was more a gentle-to-moderate \"I think it would probably be a really good idea\" sort of suggestion. Today though, she absolutely considers it VERY VERY IMPORTANT for me to have rads. So, OK, I gave her the go to set me up with a radiation oncologist. Oh, and the rads she wants me to have aren't for where my breasts used to be -- they're for my right ribcage area, where she took off several of these little skin mets which had popped up over about six weeks or so. She says rads will keep them, and new ones, at bay; if I don't have them, she's virtually positive they'll be back within a few months at most. So OK :::::sigh::::: rads look to be next. I don't know when, yet, but I think I'll find out soon enough. Um HUH? WAIT!!! She said I might get my ENERGY back at the same appointment she's telling me to have RADS? She said rads are a walk in the park compared to chemo, but still!  :-O",

Yesterday I lost my mind looking for an orange (purchased on Tuesday, at one of the med center's little food places) I still can't find. Do NOT ask why or how it ever ended up upstairs, but it did, and I kept meaning to bring it down and put in the fruit bowl on the kitchen table, but have totally NO recollection of having done so.  I DISTINCTLY recall picking it up \"on my way downstairs\" but never making it downstairs, putting it down again on my bedroom dresser, the bathroom windowsill -- and forgetting about it when I actually did go downstairs. On my way home from the radiation oncologist yesterday I stopped at the little store to buy some more fresh fruit (including oranges) and salad veggies, and when I got home  -- after 2-something PM since I also had to go to the library to make copies of my thrombophilia panel from last year; onc and I discussed it Weds and I said I'd send it: 3 copies -- one for her, one for the hematologist I'm supposed to see in August, and one for my PCP -- I was totally famished, and decided to make a fresh fruit salad. Immediately I though of \"that\" orange which I \"knew\" was \"upstairs somewhere.\" So I go upstairs to get it; I want to eat \"that\" orange first, and I always include an orange in my fruit salad. Not only did I NOT find the orange in ANY of the places I remember having had it, but I couldn't find it anywhere else in the whole friggin' HOUSE!!!!!!!!! GRRRRR!!!! After half an hour or so searching and repeatedly searching not only just the places I remembered having it, I also looked in \"stupid\" places cause I must have obviously done something stupid with it! Now yes, this place is bigger than my old place was, but it's not REALLY big either!  I could NOT find it no matter where and how many friggin' times I looked, and right now I'm getting almost as mad telling this story as I did yesterday afternoon while it was happening. Well, once I got pissed to the point where I was hurling all kinds of profane self-abusive verbiage at myself -- I mean for crying out loud it's 2 goddamn YEARS PFC and I'm off the AIs for almost 2 months, what's my frickin excuse NOW except REALLY being a total fucking idiot!! What is this crap is this already?! -- and physically throwing things I gave up and used one of the new oranges to make the fruit salad.  Not only is this orange STILL missing  (GRRRRRRRRRR! >:-{ ), later on -- dinner time, I had another problem -- I couldn't find the vinegar to put on my green salad! No, I didn't take this upstairs -- hahaha, and I did find it -- after 10 minutes, of looking on that goddamn overloaded impossible to organize chaos on the kitchen table I haven't been able to eat on in what is now almost a month. And I realize how much that's been driving me crazy the past week or so -- that, and I can't REALLY clean the kitchen unless I get all that stuff on the table put away, and the kitchen now REALLY HAS TO be cleaned totally not JUST for aesthetics/basic sanitary reasons/not letting it degenerate to the point I won't be physically able to do it, but also so I can set the ant traps I bought 2 weeks ago! AAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!!!!!!! Well that's it, I don't frickin care anymore -- the chaos has to STOP NOW. I gotta eat lunch first, but today I'm going to put all that stuff on the table back in the cabinets and if I can't reach some of it, I'll get more exercise by dragging a chair over to stand on. I hope that orange turns up before there's a trail of fruit flies to help me find it...... :-{ ",

My onc stopped in a half hour ago...after the vivisection (#2!), then rads, as soon as I got back to my room I told them (the nurses) to take my vitals then get out and stay out, and anybody who wasn't one of my regular doctors (onc, PCP, surgeon or counselor) or my boyfriend should not be allowed in. So I had 2-3 hours to sleep some of it off. My onc said she would make sure I got an actual general anesthetic this time (as in another beg removal/stent insertion tomorrow). Amy no more questions please. I'm sick and tired of them. Glad you got the wonder of such a \"clean\" experience out west -- and sooo glad you were able to enjoy your vacation and begin feeling better, too. It's still my guess that Judy is up to her ears in moving chaos and we won't be hearing from her for at least a couple more weeks. ",

      "Content": "Sep 14, 2011 08:52AM - edited Sep 14, 2011 08:53AM by Lena No, Titan, I'm never bored. I always have stuff to do -- my problem (since BC) is being too ill or too tired or otherwise whomped from illness and/or treatment most of the time to do it, or to really and truly fully enjoy it when I can muster up the strength. And I underestimate too. I had figured that since I'd finally mustered up enough energy to clean the upstairs of my house, I'd be OK for the SCA event too. Uh no, not quite. I got to enjoy some, and Sir Ivar's knighting ceremony was cool as hell, but I couldn't walk around or stand much so I also had to miss a lot of fun I would have otherwise had. :-P Oh, and speaking of \"too ill,\" guess what. Just got back from my oncologist appointment (well, OK I'm at the laundromat; my Pack Rat put the laundry basket in the trunk for me so I could do wash while he went back home to \"go to work\"). Once again, my original dismal gut instinct was right. I DO have the dreaded peritoneal metastasis, and since I'm looking  9 months pregnant with the return of the ascites -- put on 20 pounds in a week and a half and since I have a very reduced appetite, I know I'm not getting fat from overeating. Since the stents are holding my ureters open (excretory system fully online), we know the ascites is not from kidney failure this time), I'm going to have to get the paracentesis to drain it. Since I won't do aggressive chemo again because I have zero QOL on it, I am now running into the end game, including a projected expiration date range (6 months to a year and a half; two years tops) -- and that's only if I can tolerate some \"gentle\" oral chemo (she promises no brain death, no nausea, no hair loss) she wants me to take, and my Pack Rat, sitting right next to me, said he wants me to take it, so OK I said I'd try it (methotrexate and cyclophosphamide). We weren't expecting such a rapid decline (the ascites and not just a couple, but a whole bumper cropload of skin mets) so the original plan of just going on Faslodex won't cut it: she says Faslodex takes \"too long\" to work (3-6 months, and I have a DEFINITE expiration date of 3 months with no treatment at all, or what would amount to no treatment since it takes so long) so that's why the M&C, but IF I can tolerate the M&C and it works, it's possible to add/bridge over to Faslodex in 3 months.  Ummm Hmm, well how do you like THIS one -- my Pack Rat JUST called me on my cell phone to tell me that his boss \"insisted\" that he spend the day with me today instead of working... I guess that means my Pack Rat probably mentioned how I now have an expiration date.  So anyway, shortly after I get home from the laundromat and pharmacy to pick up my meds (one of the chemos plus a diuretic to take as well), he'll be coming over. I wonder what he has planned......(I didn't have \"energy\" last night, but maybe he'll somehow wake me up? yeah right we had to be up at 6 AM so I could be at the cancer center for 8:15 labs prior to seeing the oncologist...) Well, you all must remember my saying \"way back when\" that I KNEW this was going to happen from the very beginning, from the instant I first discovered my right breast had turned into a \"rock.\"  So let \"It sucks to be right all the time!\" be my epitaph. OK gotta go check my patient online page to see if they scheduled the paracentesis yet... ",

OK, though, so if you're going to use those \"fight\" terms, then know this: as far as I'm concerned, this is a battle I cannot win, and I don't even care to try. I don't want to waste what time I have left by haranguing and pestering my doctor and being on that upsy downsy crappy hope for nothing try this, try that and more nasty side effects and still go nowhere but to the early grave anyway treadmill. Yes, I really DO feel that way about \"hope\" for someone like me being nothing but a big crock of bovine feces. The ONLY thing I'm interested in now is the best possible QOL for however much time I have left.  Oh, and by the way, I am GLAD my oncologist here is straight up with me -- the oncologist I had originally wasn't and that bothered me as just much as his failure to take me seriously when I had side effects and questions about my treatment.  So now I have time to plan certain things, and hey, if somehow I actually do manage to exceed the expiration date a little, well then, so much the better (if my QOL is decent, that is), right?  (LOL I know, tell you all how I REALLY feel, huh?)  ;-) ",

I wrecked my car yesterday -- on the way home from the hospital to which I was immediately ambulanced back to. It (the accident) happened so fast -- a 50 MPH rollover -- I barely realized it had happened until I was hanging upside down trussed up like a chicken and choking from the stupid seat belts as I stared at the smashed windshield below me.  2. I have terminal cancer, a real live expiration date, a life which is pretty much not worth living and I come out of that accident without a scratch. 3. My Pack Rat says if I'm lucky, the appraiser will declare the car to be totaled. 4. And lastly, today's mail brought the permanent version of my new NH driver's license (they'd originally given me a temporary and said they'd mail me the real one).  Ummmmm. OK, and I'm having a blood transfusion tomorrow. Onc said on Tuesday my hemoglobin is low probably from the chemo (which she otherwise DOES say is working). Yes, my Pack Rat is bringing me for the transfusion. He also took me shopping this morning. And if/when whoever figures out who's paying what, my chemo is also supposed to be ramped up again -- still gentle though she promises; she wants to start me on 5-FU to go with my methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. Have fun everyone........ ",

(Either in the hospital after you wake up or at home while you're recovering?) I know, I didn't post every day either from the hospital or while convalescing at home, but I was still able to get on here to check in every few days! Well, I'll be thinking of you tomorrow too like everyone else around here, and I'm glad the Lidocaine is both helpful and on your chart. Dunno if it was me and all my loud Lab Rat squeeking but seems Lidocaine is now SOP for setting up IVs in my med center; I don't have to ask them to do that anymore. I do still need to put my EMLA on for regular blood draws though. Well whatever doesn't hurt is fine with me. :-) Amy -- I was also terrified about chemo brain before I started my chemo in 2009. It was my #1 fear (in order my top feared SEs were: chemo brain, then nausea/vomiting tied with hair loss; the others kind of paled after those, i.e., fatigue, weird or no appetite, premature but permanent menopause, etc.). Those were the reasons why I originally wanted to decline treatment. They did do a good job controlling the nausea/vomiting but I never got all my marbles back and it has taken two and a half years for SOME of my hair to get to top of shoulder length. My brain was my reason for living, it defined who I was, and the best parts are gone. I just don't wanna know about if I'd have ANY brains left if I did any of those harsh chemos now. My onc really wanted to put me on Abraxane for this peritoneal mets business but I wouldn't do it, so that's how I got the gentle stuff this time -- I specifically said to her \"NO MORE BRAIN DEATH!\"). Oh, and Amy, ALL chemo brain is real -- why would you doubt yours but not the rest of us?! Hope you enjoy the visit with your parents. BE CAREFUL DRIVING! If I could wreck in rural NH who knows what could happen to YOU. Judy -- yes, you (and everyone who said stuff like that) does make me feel better. It's why I didn't totally leave the board last week (I was disgusted with a lot stuff in the Stage IV area and was thinking I needed another long vacation from BCO)...but didn't because I didn't want to miss YOU all HERE or disappear on Betsy either. Oh, and so your kids finish your sentences, huh? At least someone does. My Pack Rat constantly accuses me of not finishing sentences. He's right, I don't, only it drives him buggy. :-( Titan -- I refuse to believe you were \"meant to\" survive your youthful car wrecks and get breast cancer for the purpose of getting to annoy me or anyone else. LOL Funny thing, while my Pack Rat isn't religious either, he's agnostic, not atheist. The difference between us is that for me, if there is no directly or indirectly MEASURABLE PROOF that something DOES exist, I don't believe it exists. He believes that the lack of direct or indirect measurable proof means that MAYBE it exists, so shouldn't necessarily be discounted because it hasn't been proven either way that it exists or not. Doesn't matter what time it'll be when I drink for Betsy, since I'm planning on a protein drink anyway (I'm still too skinny and don't want to overdo booze while taking pain pills). Or maybe it'll be morning coffee, if I sleep late enough. Normally I get up between 7:30-9:30 but 10:30 isn't unheard of (yeah, I'm in EST so 1:30 PM for Betsy will be 10:30 in the morning for me). Geri -- I haven't been there in decades, but I've been to Bear Mountain once (it's gorgeous) and I used to continue to think of it as I drove past it going up north to see my Pack Rat while I was still living in NJ. LOL Okay, maybe I'll figure out what you mean when you say I have a whole \"new perspective\" on QOL -- but hmmm, is it this: My perspective is new because you never met anyone else who shared it?  Nitey-nite all. ",

The quickie upside is that if any of you are interested in going to the existing chatrooms, we can and I'll post up later on how to do it if you're interested. And now for a partial morphine ramble (it's bag changing day, so I'm premedicating as per nurse's orders; she'll be here in a little while)....... ......had my 5-FU infusion on Wednesday, and yes, it throws off both the who-pays paperwork and also up-ends the what chemo I take and when, for the same reason (who-pays), because palliative and hospice can't get their collective litigious anencephalic heads about definitions about \"what is palliative care?\" and \"what is hospice care?\" and what is \"increase QOL care?\"out of their shit clogged asses. So I had the 5-FU and it went well enough, but was told to stop taking the methotrexate and cyclophosphamide for the rest of the week. I forgot if I'm supposed to pick those back up next week or not. So far as this regime (5-FU, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide) is concerned, my onc wants me on all 3 of these, so theoretically I should have stayed on M & C but couldn't. I can't do the 5-FU next week because I have no ride (Pack Rat is back working out of state, in the office), and in light of all that I don't know if I should take the M & C anyway; those are pills I have in the house and don't need to go anywhere to take them). Donna my nurse, sweetie that she is, is having to repeatedly switch me back and forth from hospice department (which will pay for M & C but not 5-FU) and regular visiting nurse patient department (which will pay for 5-FU and not M & C). Every other time she's here i have to sign this stupid paperwork I'm ready to just start lighting f***ing matches already. And so none of these stupid ass organizations wants me to give me anything but a hassle over a chemo regime my oncologist wants me to take and now the hospital decides I what I really gotta do after my 5-FU infusion on Wednesday is go to the ER and get X-rays and maybe a CT scan of my chest because my oxygen is in the low 80s instead of between 95-100 like it usually is/should be -- when I have NOT just taken a necessary prescribed dose of a pain pill which is KNOWN to do that? Now they're all over me about pleural effusions and lung clots like I'm gonna drop dead in an instant when there's been minor indications of verfy small amounts of pleural effusion all along and nobody said the f*** anything -- it has to be them trying to keep me there after a long day (prior to the labs and 5-FU infusion, we'd gone to clean out my wrecked car and clear things up with the PD in the town I wrecked in).  HUH???? WTF is this CRAP? I accepted the X-ray but then insisted on leaving. Oh and I was now not able to have my ureter stent surgery either because labs said my platelets were too low. So no I don't know a goddamn thing anymore and don't even care. I'm done and going straight into Mrs. Pack Rat Mode. My Pack Rat's mother is a sweet and good hearted lady but she is also a very ignorant lady where doctors and medical issues are concerned, in spite of her own (thankfully non-cancerous) ills and those of her 80-year-old Senior Pack Rat. She never questions the doctors or discusses treatment alternatives, she just takes her medicine with a \"Yes, Doctor\" reply. Well that's where I'm going because I can't handle this other nonsense anymore. If they wanna kill me fine. If not, maybe they'll do something right that MATTERS. I have HAD it already.  When THEY officially call me and tell me to go back on my M & C I'll do it. When THEY want to schedule procedures and surgeries for me in a civilized, coordinated manner, I'll have them. Otherwise I'm just gonna sit here, take my pain meds as needed and let the nurse in to change my ascites bag. Catch you later with more chat room info if you want it. ",

After the chemo nightmare came the hormonals (2009 into early 2010): tamoxifen which was great for 5 months until it gave me a blood clot, then the rest of the year (and first few months of 2011) on AIs which were almost as horrific as chemo -- so good thing I replenished the food supply as soon as the chemo started to wear off. Finally moved up here fall 2010 so even though there's more support being much closer -- 20 mins -- from my Pack Rat, well I do still live by myself by choice and mostly I prefer to deal with the beast as independently as possible. When I'm heading into a treatment I know I know will be difficult, as in leave me fatigued and/or in pain or for whatever reason not really \"up to\" things like shopping or cleaning, I prepare in advance. Like a few days before chemo, I stocked up on food and Ensure, paper plates, biotene toothpaste/mouthwash, toilet paper, paper towels, OTC meds to the point where with the exception of perishables (milk, eggs, yogurt and fresh fruit, which is LIGHT shopping) I was able to not have to do ANY really heavy grocery trips AT all for the four entire months I was in chemo PLUS the two more months I needed to just barely pull myself out of THAT hole! Now not having to do any shopping when you're messed up from chemo is a REALLY good thing, and \"all\" I had to do to prepare for it was just do a major shopping trip before starting treatment --voila, I did not NEED to ask anybody for help at all to make sure I could eat.  Similarly, in 2011, the last two days before my BMX were spent on another massive shopping trip similar to when I prepared for chemo, PLUS, getting all the staple foods, dishes, pots and pans out of cabinets and putting it on the kitchen table so I would be able to easily get at everything I needed for cooking and eating when I knew the BMX would leave me unable to get things out of cabinets for awhile, and, I also cleaned the house top to bottom because I was sure I wouldn't be up to THAT while convalescing from surgery!. My Pack Rat took me for surgery and stayed the night with me, I was OK, so he went out to do things. I was just fine (as long as I took my pain pills LOL). He came back later to spend the night each night until I was able to get out of bed without help, and while he was here, I was able to feed him as well as myself. Since the BMX (May 20th 2011) I've had 25 rads (I pre-shopped and was also going to clean the house before rads like I did before the BMX, but on house-cleaning day I had to be rushed to the hospital for kidney failure!). So the house really needs to be cleaned in a big way by NOW -- rads made me too tired and my energy still isn't back all the way! Oh, the rads. Treatments 3-10 were done in the hospital since I had to be in for 9 days, but after I got out of the hospital I drove myself to rads every day. Towards the end (around the 20th or 21st treatment) I was starting to be so fatigued I was doubting my ability to drive to rads (its a 60 mile round trip), so I mentioned it to my Pack Rat -- said I'd do it as long as could, but then would ask him to drive me to treatment probably when I got to the boosts. He agreed, but as it happened I had to stop treatment after the 25th zapping -- suddenly I ended up with second degree burns, showed 'em to my RO and she stopped it. Orignally was supposed to have 33 but my skin just wasn't in it! Next will be Faslodex..... Anyway, going it alone is possible. You just have to get as ready as you can when you're going into a new treatment which is likely to incapacitate you. ",

And yes it makes TOTAL sense to get frustrated by the effects of continuing chemo brain -- I do too, but I think the Ritalin is starting to help some more. I was NEVER very good at multitasking, so \"inability to multitask\" isn't my problem although it does happen to be true that what minimal ability I had for multitasking before chemo is all gone now. My cognitive issues are losses of focus, ability to concentrate, and short term memory, all of which I had in great abundance prior to chemo. The Ritalin is helping the focus/concentration issues at least, but maybe it's a mixed blessing. That is, instead of flitting from idea to idea easily distracted unable to focus on any of them from chemo through before starting the Ritalin, now when I go on a tangent (which happens less often, thankfully) I focus on the tangent just as well as on the primary, but when I come off the tangent I then proceed to forget how I got there in the first place. Well at least I can finally (sorta) think straight........   :::::sigh::::: Betsy, well, I was just thinking of you when I saw that other compression bra. If the one you have is working and you're happy with it, there's no reason to change. About the changing clothes in \"public\" bit -- I haven't in years (I only did it while enduring forcible PE in school as a kid/teen) and won't, PERIOD.  I'm only willing to take my clothes off in PRIVATE: to shower/bathe, for sex and for a doctor. Not that I buy clothes often, but when I do --  clothing stores which do not have a dressing room with private curtained off areas to try the clothes on do not get my business -- unless they're very close to where I live and have a liberal exchange/refund policy which allows me to try stuff on at home, keep what I like and what fits me, bring back and be refunded for what didn't look good on me even if it fit, and exchange what I liked but didn't fit quite right for a bigger or smaller one. And yes, the reason for all this modesty on my part, now that my former excuse which served me for 20-something years -- \"I'm too fat!\" -- is no longer applicable, is my cancer-mangled misshapen disfigured right breast. *I* don't like to see it myself, so I'm really not up to showing it off. Ohh, and you know what this made me just realize? (OMG) Even though my Pack Rat has been so accepting of all this and acting as though it doesn't matter what I look like, and, we still have plenty of wild hot rats-in-heat sex (actually more than we used to since I moved up here) -- I've been keeping the bedroom light off except for the little nightlight! Gosh, I didn't do that when I was fat, but I do for THIS! Go figure. Nope, no spring here yet. Today's partly cloudy so no snow or ice, but it's cold (in the 30s) and windy.  Well, enjoy your weekends everyone. ",

(FUN!! --NOT!) So it's almost like back to the beginning in a way. The M-word was discussed a bit though, and while she says the person I really have to talk to in order to find out about recovery time, and how much more disabled it would make me than what I already am would be the breast surgeon, who I'll probably get connected to soon. One thing though -- she (my onc) was talking about lymph node removal as a part of my mastectomy. I said I'm really not keen on THAT seeing how there has been no indication of cancer in the nodes since I finished chemotherapy. I need to see what happens with the upcoming tests -- mammo/US and biopsies first before any serious plans are made. Chemo brain hit me because while we were talking about the mastectomy stuff, I forgot to mention that big study recently which showed that lymph node dissection and removal make no difference in survival rate unless the patient actually has cancer in the nodes.  Meaning I'll have to remember to tell her about that in two weeks when I see her again about the mammo/US results because I do NOT want the lymphedema risk.  I got ENOUGH wrong with me as it is. NO MORE! Oh and speaking of things wrong with me, I saw the psychotherapist today...I did mention that I was going to have counseling/cognitive behavior therapy up here right? I was not even able to answer most of her questions/tell her what she wanted to know regarding my feelings and so on without busting into tears, and forget about describing the background and context she needs to know in order to even be ABLE to help me. I think I'm having a good old fashioned nervous breakdown. Hmmm, what else...I don't get this one but I was actually more stressed out for yesterday's onc appointment than any of the others to date, and my Pack Rat went WITH ME this time. Go figure..... After the oncologist he showed me the food co-op up in Lebanon he'd been telling me about since it's a hop skip and a jump out of Dartmouth. I needed to buy fresh fruit and salad stuff...so I'm restocked on GOOD food, plus, oh, those bell peppers they had, all colors, all fresh -- I bought some to make Italian Rainbow for dinner. Which was yummy but we really stunk up the place -- I had to spray air freshener in the BEDROOM. Ewwww... LOL. Kinda cool also -- Pack Rat can \"work from home\" in MY computer room/office. All he has to do is bring his laptop with Pro-Engineer and his webcam, I shut down my Mini and he uses the Mini's KVM plug -- easy to get at -- so he gets my big screen (and the webcam can sit on the hutch shelf). Plus he has Skype so he can consult with his manager (or manager can get hold of him) as needed. And if I want to be on the computer too, I can use my iBook.  He did that yesterday afternoon when we got back from Dartmouth. Gosh I don't even have my time sequence straight, I keep bouncing and bouncing. Oh well I guess that's normal for having a nervous breakdown, right? Uggggh snow tomorrow, almost a foot of it! Glad I did laundry on Monday plus bought the fresh fruit and veggies yesterday so I can hide in the house, but crapola I am soooo sick and tired of winter and cold weather already. And next week my Pack Rat has his week working in CT. Hope you all feel as well as possible..... ",

I\u2019ve been off that poison since 4/28 (almost three weeks), and other than a major case of preoperative stress, have been passing for human, including feeling good for the first time since this all started and getting a noticeable amount of brain power back. I think I made it up to warp 2 for awhile -- even with the preop stress I was at least mostly OK...but now definitely back down to impulse power only but hell, this time yesterday I was on an operating table and so now it\u2019s the Percocet. Unlike AIs, however, Percocet is only temporary and it\u2019s not making me depressed so it\u2019s OK. What would you say if I tell you I feel 1000% better less than 24 hours out from a BMX than I did on the AIs?! How awful  is THAT?   So now that I\u2019m off that crap which may have kept me alive but made my life almost totally not worth living, I\u2019m sorry for my last bad behavior, medication or whatever induced it might have been.   Betsy, please accept my deepest condolences regarding your mother.  :-*(   Geri -- sorry to hear about your BF\u2019s mother\u2019s death also. Please accept my sympathies for the two of you.  :-*(   Helen, that\u2019s great about that distinguished leadership award.

I\u2019ll have to look that one up.   Judy, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better of late. Hope your daughter is over her sickness, too.   Wake up Titan! Yeah, well OK, true enough, too many doctor appointments make ME tired too, so I know how you feel. Thank goodness, my next appointment isn\u2019t till June 6th so I finally oh finally get a whole week off from doctors!   Hi again Tammy. Glad you\u2019re doing mostly OK. Sorry to hear you\u2019re having issues with Tamoxifen -- I hope you don\u2019t end up on AIs!!!!!   Amy -- yeah, looks like we are polar opposites when it comes to dealing with severe nastiness such as BC -- you saying you couldn\u2019t get through it alone, whereas for me the worse I feel, the more antisocial I get. I\u2019m sorry I behaved like that, I just should have said I needed \u201cspace\u201d or something to that effect.   So yeah, I\u2019m doing better now. OK, I\u2019m not REALLY better though, just able to HANDLE it for the time being,  if that makes sense. That is, I\u2019m not so depressed -- I\u2019m still on the Wellbutrin and Ritalin but they actually WORK. Prior to the meltdown I had last month where I left, I was horribly depressed in spite of the mental health meds. Since my cancer took a turn for the worse (progression despite the Arimidex) my oncologist took me off it, and about a week later I started to feel progressively better, kind of a day-by-day slow but steady improvement: starting with not physically feeling 90 (joint aches easing, movement easing) and then fewer and fewer crying jags/wishing I was dead.   OK so yeah. Yesterday I had a BMX (the surgeon actually agreed with me at our preop visit when I said \u201cstay away from the nodes\u201d) with deportation and removal of several skin mets on the area of my right ribcage. I was shocked that a BMX would be a one day procedure, no need to spend even one night in the hospital. My Pack Rat came over on Thursday night so I got one last night (for awhile) to spoil him rotten with food, wine, rape and pillage). Yesterday took me to the hospital, stayed with me till they took me to OR,, was in the recovery room with me, took me home and spent the night, which I needed because if he hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of bed this morning (I felt severe pulling with every slight motion I tried for getting out of bed). So he helped me out of bed and I was OK again, especially when I took my Percocet! We had coffee and breakfast, now he\u2019s out doing the stuff he needs to do today but will be back later to spend the evening (and help me out of bed tomorrow morning if I still can\u2019t get out on my own). And, Dartmouth set up a visiting nurse to come once a day. I can empty the drains but don\u2019t dare open the dressing on my chest.  She\u2019ll be here in just over an hour.   Oh, I have two drains, which as I said, I can empty, but.....last night when I was emptying them in preparation to go to bed, with the first one, I accidentally knocked over the cup full of blood and it looked like someone got murdered in my bathroom.   Since I fully stocked up on food and piled stuff (pots and pans, plates, paper plates, canned food and soup, coffee, sugar and so on, all the important stuff) on the kitchen table so I don\u2019t have to drag it down from cabinets, I\u2019m OK otherwise (i.e., I can function slowly, as long as we don\u2019t count gettting out of bed hahaha), and now I know I have to cap up the blood-cup IMMEDIATELY after emptying a drain.     And there\u2019s a table and chairs out on the porch now, too... I don\u2019t want to go outside with these hanging drain pouches but I can sit out on the upstairs porch with the iBook now to get fresh air if I want.   Sorry again...but gotta go now get out stuff for when the nurse gets here.   Hope you're having a good weekend everyone. ",

Yeah, that IS one heck of an amazing Pack Rat I have all right. He's in my nest now, sleeping. His allergies/sinuses are bugging him so he went to bed early. If I hadn't slept half the afternoon (took a two hour nap, about 2:30 to almost 5!) I'd be in bed too, but it is what it is; my body likes to conk out late afternoon (or maybe that's just my best healing time? I knew to expect post-op fatigue so I'm not surprised). I'm starting to wind down again now though, so I'll be in bed soon. But he's still sleeping here at night since I still can't get out of bed in the morning without help. Heck, I can get IN bed, lie down on my back and fall asleep just fine, though...go figure. I thought that would  be hard initially too, sleeping on my back -- I usually sleep \"fetal\" curled up on my side, but I can do it, and I can take NAPs sleeping sitting up on the couch. Don't know why I can only sleep 2-3 hours sitting up though.. And, I can do mostly everything ELSE that doesn't involve raising my arms up or lifting anything heavier than a full tea kettle -- or thinking too hard... Percocet is a really good pain killer, but it's also a pretty good BRAIN killer too. But at least THIS brain death is only temporary.  Hey did any of you have post-op jaw issues?  As in maybe something happened from having the anesthesia tube which misaligned your jaw? This is actually the most painful of my physical issues, believe it or not; the pain med doesn't help it like it helps the \"pulling\" pain of the incisions. If I open my mouth too wide it hurts and my jaw makes this pop-crack noise (like TMJ \"disease\" except I don't actually have that), so I have to eat very carefully. I figured out a way to \"suck\" grapes into my mouth though, uhhh LOL oh wait, I know how come I can do THAT....just call me Eureka.  hehehe THAT's gotta be the real reason why my Pack Rat wanted me to live.  >;-)   Well I'll ask the nurse about the jaw thing when she comes tomorrow. Yeah Titan, the drains ARE a pain. They're not nearly as bad as I originally anticipated, but I'm far from comfortable with them -- I don't like handling them. I have this terry-cloth velcroed \"belt\" around my waist with terry-cloth pouches so they're secured well enough (I lack sufficient fine motor coordination to use \"safety\" pins or any other kind of pins for that matter)...but it feels...weird...to take them out of the pouches to check on them, like they kind of \"catch\" and are hard for me to take out (this is probably my lack of fine motor control again). And even though the bulbs are \"plugged\" closed, so don't have to \"sit upright\" in the pouches, I just get this \"queasy\" feeling they might leak since I usually find them lying down in the pouches, and even though the tubes fit fully in the pouches with the bulbs I'm still afraid I'll somehow get them caught on something. It doesn't make sense since I have a pouch for each drain and each pouch will hold \"the works,\" plus my shirt comes down over them which protects as well as conceals them (kinda: I almost look pregnant and that's partly why I don't want to go outside except upstairs on the porch), they still make me nervous.  I'm supposed to keep them until the drainage is 30 cc or less for 24 hours. Today's total was 65 cc each, so looks like it's gonna be awhile longer.",

OK, so I'm not having a meltdown, the pain meds work so I'm not in physical agony or anything, but today is the first day I even had the nerve to really LOOK at my chest.  Yeah, I've taken my shirt off, opened the surgical camisole and let the visiting nurse examine it to make sure it was OK and change/remove the dressing, but I didn't actually look at it myself. Today the visiting nurse said how \"beautifully\" it was healing, so way later (she was here in the early afternoon), as in about 9-something this evening while doing my PM drain maintenance, I took the surgical camisole off again and looked at my bare chest. REALLY looked at it. Beautiful?! Uhhhh...well sure, if \"Just Dissected\" qualifies as beautiful. Even though I'm a warped ex-mad scientist, the closest I was able to get to \"beautiful\" was to think \"I'm REALLY glad I lost all that weight because at least I won't look TOTALLY horrible after the drains come out and I get past \"'Just Dissected.'\" :::sigh::: I asked the nurse today if my jaw thing could possibly be from the anesthetic breathing tube and she says yes and it's not uncommon.  Judy -- I don't know if I grind my teeth while sleeping but my jaw was totally fine BEFORE my surgery. So I hope it goes away soon.  Oh geez, Amy, about the clothes -- last week I was looking in my closet and NONE of my clothes were \"right.\" It's hard to explain... It was like I was looking at someone else's wardrobe. My \"closet clothes\" (as compared to my \"dresser clothes\") consist of my work clothes (and I haven't worked since the economy ate my job in May 2008), plus my \"nice\" clothes -- casual but \"more\" than just T-shirt and jeans outfits. Stuff I would wear when I wanted to look hot for my Pack Rat or was just feeling happy or pretty (yes, BEFORE this breast cancer nightmare started). I remember when I hit my goal weight a couple months ago I was really looking forward to wearing one of the \"happy pretty\" outfits in particular (once it got warm enough: all my favorite clothes were SUMMER clothes!), But last week specifically -- Thursday night actually, getting ready for my Pack Rat to come over and us to have our last \"wild rats in heat night\" prior to surgery, and, because I knew that although I was finally thin enough to look good in that dress again but I'd better wear it \"now\" while I still had breasts, so I put it on, and even though it fit me, it didn't look or feel right! I used to love that dress, I called it the \"Pine Barrens dress\" (yeah, that's a \"story\") and I used to specifically wear it because it was sexy and it made me feel sexy when I wore it, but this time it didn't look or feel sexy even though it was before the BMX. I took it off and ended up just wearing jeans and a T-shirt...because after I took the dress off I looked in the closet for something else sexy/pretty to wear and I felt like I was looking in a STRANGER'S closet! I mean NOTHING was right, and I realized on top of that, most of it probably won't even fit me anymore especially after surgery what with all the drastic changes to my body...So I guess there's another project for after my drains come out and I'm not afraid to try to do more than basic subsistence things: I have to get rid of my \"closet clothes.\"  I'll take them to the thrift shop. Well at least I'll have more storage space with all those clothes gone. Oh, I have a painting project too, or at least I did. Now my Pack Rat's going to have to do it. The upstairs screened-in porch -- painting it yellow with white trim and brown floor.",

And like HE isn't swamped up the kazoo either. In addition to MY projects he still has a list of his own projects which goes out to the planet Jupiter. He said last night that today he'd be ordering the parts to fix my car's passenger side front end to make it inspectable at all even, and now it's also finally time to get the studded snow tires off and \"normal\" ones put on (which he has to help with naturally). ...I'm getting tired even thinking of all this, and I had my nap this afternoon!     Oh, I graphed my drainage this morning; my Pack Rat said he was curious about what the curve looked like, and I tried to predict it based on the data. Yup, I'll have to tell him, it looks like I expected it to; linear, not exponential. I haven't made a graph like this since I took chemistry and physics courses in college and had to do it for my lab reports. LOL I'm not any better at drawing now than I was then. Maybe I should get some software to do this. Well if the numbers are low enough tonight and stay that way tomorrow too, I'll be below my 30 cc or less per drain per day goal. This morning was 8.5 cc in the right drain, 20 cc in the left, so I'm getting close. ohgosh, even though I know I'm not recovered \"enough\" and am still actually too tired (not to mention way too UNSEXY) for our usual Hump Day festivities yet, it sure was bizarre last night tucking that Pack Rat into my nest and NOT molesting him.",

All day yesterday, actually all day the last couple of days until a little way into them, my chest had been feeling what I call \"kind of raw,\" which means \"doesn't hurt enough to justify pain pills, but hurts enough to be noticeable. Today is also \"kind of raw.\" I think today's post surgical recovery improvement was more in terms of range of motion/what I can do physically rather than a reduction in pain -- I did the laundry this morning! Almost all by myself, too, once my Pack Rat carried the laundry basket to the trunk of my car (he always does that if he's here when I want to do wash). The only help I had to ask for was to ask the laundromat lady to close the washers for me (they have to be pushed hard, held in and locked; honestly I found them difficult BEFORE the BMX so I wasn't shocked I couldn't do them at all today). Anyway yeah it was kind of like taking a post-surgical shower, i.e., I can do it effectively but with accommodations.  I was able to do more than I expected, like I can close the trunk of my car if I stand up on tiptoes so I don't have to reach up so high, and, I used the \"lower\" dryers instead of the \"upper\" ones, which I usually use to spare my back (and waist/knees from bending down when I was on AIs).  And, I had to bring the basket of clean clothes up in \"steps\" -- (a) out of the car on to a kitchen chair...rest... (b) pick it up, lean it on the couch by the staircase and rest....then (c) up the stairs, put it on the end table. Prior to surgery I'd do that in a straight run to \"get it over with.\" Not today though!   Oh and I entered my May weights (plus did some math to calculate for the days I didn't actually weigh myself, i.e., from the day after surgery until the morning after the drains came out) into my computer chart and YAY!!! Found out I held a steady average of 122 pounds all month with absolutely NO obsessive calorie counting and NO meal pre-planning like I had to do to lose weight -- I went up a little in March and down a little in April adjusting to \"knowing\" how much food I could eat for a maintenance level. This morning's scale weight 121.2. So cool, I learned how much food my body needs for me to eat this past year. (AND I have room for CHEESECAKE on my birthday).   Um. Speaking of food, it's lunchtime! Later all! ",

I just got back from a walk to the pharmacy to pick up my Lunesta and some contact lens wetting solution, and, as I walked home, I saw this young guy walking his dog. He was wearing shorts but no shirt. But we all know why men can do that but women can't (unless they go to a nudist camp or get a job in Hooter's maybe?) -- because of their BREASTS. Well now that I don't have any breasts, I wonder if I'd be \"allowed\" to go out wearing ONLY shorts or ONLY a pair of jeans? Not that I'd actually do it or anything, certainly not now with the still a bit too much Frankenstein chest, but after that all heals.....? Gosh THAT could be a real trip -- IF by that time I learn to get used to my new body, anyway. Nope, I'm still not used to it, still feeling condemned to black and dark colored tops because that HIDES my totally flat chest (which my Pack Rat actually TOLD me he hoped I'd get used to, so maybe I'll show it to him this weekend...er MAYBE). But maybe someday, if I live long enough. I used to love to start up a good shocking ruckus back in the day......  Gardening: Canteloupe and zinnias are way in the lead, but some of everything I planted is growing at least. So the cherry tomatoes will be planted on schedule this weekend. And yesterday we had one of \"those\" kinds of downpours -- the heavy downpour on a day when the temperature is at least 80 -- a carwash downpour --  only I had to \"waste\" it, because of the thunder and lightning (so bad I shut down my entire Network). Oh well. Maybe next time.   ",

I'm getting them on my chest (where my breasts used to be), that right ribcage area where I had the skin mets taken off, and the very lowest part of my neck.  Yeah I'm a little surprised on how much of my body is getting them -- I thought originally it was just going to be where the skin mets were, but...oh well, and I am doing this WHY?! I'm recovering at a normal rate with regards to my current range of motion in terms of 4 weeks post-BMX (tomorrow), but now I have to RUSH it! As in MORE exercises to do at home, PT TWICE a week for the next couple weeks instead of once a week! I have two doctors (my oncologist and surgeon) who, if matters could have only proceeded 100% to THEIR plans -- would have both dragged me kicking and screaming into the radiation chamber THIS week! And why didn't they? Because I'm still not able to lie down and even GET my arms over my head, much less be able to hold them up that way for however long it takes to do the simulations or getting the rads. Hence the rush! They want me physically ready to have simulation on July 1st so I can get rads ASAP. Dose: 33 total (28 regular, 5 booster). Oh this is going to be fun....   ---NOT---  ....and I'm doing this WHY?! Nope Amy, I don't have the necessary baking equipment to make cheesecake. Probably just as well -- that is NOT something I need to have in the house at any other time than around my birthday. I'm glad you survived NYC. The crowds and noise and traffic are precisely why I refused to go there in the last 12 years (ever since my divorce which meant no more being dragged there by the husband) -- even though I lived \"only\" 20 mins away by train.  And I'll just BET you were exhausted when you got back from that place. Judy -- last summer I was where you are now -- organizing and packing up for a big move. Not as big as yours, but big. And yes it WAS exhausting and overwhelming.  Geri, yeah I've heard of the Pack Rat Storage Bins. There's even a moving company called Pack Rat.

I DID consider the idea that maybe I'd eaten it and forgotten that I'd eaten it -- while actually looking for it when I first noticed it missing. However, I dismissed it because that particular morning I'd had eggs and garlic roasted potatoes for breakfast with my Pack Rat, and when I eat the garlic potatoes, I don't eat an orange or any other fruit like I do with the lighter breakfasts I normally eat; egg and garlic potatoes (which I make special for my Pack Rat sometimes) is a heavy enough \"stick with you\" kind of breakfast so I don't \"need\" a piece of fruit too.   OMG Betsy! That lymphedema business sounds even worse than I figured it was. YUUUUCK, blisters? And how do you FUNCTION?   Hey Helen, don't you have some kind of party coming up soon? Your retirement party, right?    And in other news....I went for a walk yesterday afternoon. All was well until I got to the area by the water about three quarters of a mile from the house. Some people were there fishing (not unusual) -- but suddenly I notice I'm being stared at, by ALL of them, in this \"OMG\" kind of way. First thing I'm wondering is oh wow do I have a booger hanging out of my nose or something? And then I realize it's gotta be my COMPLETELY FLAT CHEST -- no I didn't have any boogers, I was wearing pants and a T-shirt, and even if I don't LIKE my hair this way, it's definitely \"normal\" (albeit for someone ELSE LOL). I mention that because other than The Chest, there was nothing odd or unusual about my appearance, and I'd recently had a shower, so I didn't smell bad or anything.  If I said I was getting better on the body image issue, I think I spoke too soon, because I was so embarrassed I wanted to die.   :::::sigh:::::   I think most of my ROM is back, though some things still hurt to do (i.e., the newer exercises the therapist gave me last time). Today I seemed to have both enough ROM and enough energy to (FINALLY) clean the whole house top to bottom -- one of the good thorough \"once a month\" cleanings, which it was time for, especially since I skipped all the weekly smaller cleanings this time because of the surgery...but yeah it wiped me out. It's a beautiful day for a walk but I'm too tired to go in addition to still feeling embarrassed when I think of yesterday. At least I have a clean house to sit around in feeling sorry for myself now.          ",

I collapse for the rest of the day as soon as I get home! Haven't cleaned the house in a month and it's been 3 weeks since I cooked anything more than fried egg and cheese sandwiches for my Pack Rat when he's here (that's his favorite breakfast). My eating habits are really starting to remind me of how I ate when I was on chemo -- microwaved canned soup, instant oatmeal, cold cereal, yogurt, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and various kinds of fruit, and drinking Ensure when I have zero appetite, which is actually fairly often. As long as I don't have to cook it, it's OK, and most of that is good on paper plates so not TOO much dishes either. Betsy, about how my skin is holding up: today I noticed The Chest starting to actually look red, even though so far it doesn't hurt or itch any worse than it did while pink. I apply cortisone cream, then Jeans cream, and now Aquafor too. I hate all this gooey guck on my body and can't wait till I can stop using it and just be clean and dry, especially now that I'm back to being able to take real showers again. Amy, you must be pretty buff by now, huh? Should we call you Mrs. Universe? ;-)  You did rads right after chemo though, didn't you? And it's only NOW you're wondering if you have a thyroid issue? Next time my oncologist wants blood, I'll ask her to test my thyroid. It was normal when I had it tested last fall or winter, but I hadn't had my rads yet. OMG about the cancer camp and the Bucket List (haven't seen it). Yeah, enough is enough sometimes, isn't it! I agree with Helen -- it IS harder to unpack than it is to pack. How's it going with that, Judy? And yeah Helen, let's keep that countdown going -- you retiring and me finishing rads. Oh, and BTW, RETIREMENT means YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE PLANS anymore. That's what's so GOOD about it. You can do what you want, when you want, health and finances permitting of course. No more having to answer to anybody but yourself. OK, I wouldn't have chosen to get Stage IV breast cancer to be able to \"retire,\" but since that's kind of the case, being \"disability retired,\" at least that's one \"good\" thing about it. Geri, I'm thinking of you again since we had two more carwash downpours (yesterday and today). I didn't wash my car though, because I'm just too wiped out.  And speaking of wiped out, I'm now done for today. Gonna lie down and read. ",

GRRR Amy -- so now you know I love the dress, and I'm the kind of person who totally HATES maybe 90-95% of all formalwear, too (which is yet another reason why I've always gone out of my way to avoid formal social occasions). Well, this is one of the rare exceptions; obviously I think this dress is totally gorgeous! But, that \"scarfy thing\" which you said you probably wouldn't wear is, in my opinion, SPECIFICALLY what MAKES the dress so beautiful; so I would definitely wear it if I had a dress like it. Summing up my opinion on the business with your soon-to-be son-in-law, also being one whose observations, however initially childlike/immature, resulted in blaming my mother for my parents' divorce, I would probably feel angry too. I don't know, and don't have to know, THEIR specific situation, but I grew up intimately acquainted, from a very young age, with ugly family stuff. And oh yeah, come to think of it -- way back when, I didn't even TELL my mother or anyone else in my family that I was getting married and I sure as hell didn't invite any of them to the wedding. Oh, I hope the lady who helped you zip your dress when you tried it on, who just started chemo, will have the ENERGY to attend her son's wedding! Judy -- it's good to hear your settling into your new home is progressing slowly but surely. I'm sure you'll find an oncologist soon enough. Helen -- it's so NICE to be rid of job-related stress, isn't it? Geri -- We here in southwestern NH had no Irene damage at all either -- it was just a nasty windier than usual, heavier rain than usual, storm. The last three days it resumed raining every day again -- remnants of Lee? Well, it was just rainy; normal rainy, not big bad rainy-windy like Irene. Today's partly cloudy but hopefully clearing up..weekend will be nice though (sunny 70s).  Oh wait Geri, I almost forgot -- I have some more TMI for you. My hair is finally just long enough to start getting in the way when I have my Pack Rat for dessert.  ;-) Betsy -- good to hear you were happy with the bone density test result, for whatever reason! :-) Oh, so you're having the dildo-cam too, huh? LOL! Seriously, you're right, bloody vaginal discharges while taking Tamoxifen are NOT good. From the standpoint of \"tell the doctor right away to be tested and treated as soon as possible,\" (which I no longer subscribe to; more momentarily) you did the smart thing telling your doctor and being tested. Have you gotten the results yet? All right...update time. It's mixed, both good and bad. The Good: Yes, I'm making noticeable progress in my recovery from the rads. I feel like a moulting snake (every time I think I'm done peeling, hours later I'm peeling AGAIN) but I don't consider that unbearable. The painful red is gone, and the broken blister-scabs are mostly healed. I can give my Pack Rat real hugs again, and it feels wonderful for him to jump my bones again; we finally did the him-on-top thing for the first time since just before my BMX. ;-) I also have to say I'm getting a little more energy, albeit not as much and not as quickly as I'd like. Then again, there might be a reason for that (more momentarily, in the Bad News section). But still, I have more energy now than I did when I was at the height of the rads fatigue. I have yet to clean the house, but I'm back to cooking dinners again and I only \"need\" to lie on the couch for an hour or two during the day (instead of half my waking hours). Oh, and I also finally started paying actual attention to my plants again: both the Colei on the porch and container garden on the deck -- let's see, I think it was Saturday (the only day of the Labor Day weekend which didn't rain -- when I got back to serious plant care. So here's how my plants are faring: Despite my basic neglect all summer, not only did almost all the plants survive, but I have a whole bunch of baby tomatoes (they're still green, I'm waiting for them to get ripe) and more flowers so will have a real bumper crop of grape tomatoes. There's also three baby canteloupes, numerous baby cucumbers and the scallions and some of the carrots were ready for harvesting...so I harvested them, and for the first time ever, got to eat food I had grown myself. When my Pack Rat came over Tuesday night I made olive-oil sauteed potatoes with chopped scallions in them to go with the chicken.  There weren't many carrots so we just munched on them. The lettuce didn't make it... well actually it did -- beautifully, but that was shortly after I came home from the 9 days in the hospital whomped from trying to recover from kidney failure at the same time rads fatigue began to hit. So I didn't have the energy to harvest it when I should have, so it got bug-eaten and wilted. The whole summer, as I said, I neglected my plants terribly, only watering them just in time to stave off death; none of the daily TLC I originally gave them. This past Saturday, now that I was finally well enough to resume taking care of the plants -- after harvesting the scallions and \"ready\" carrots, plus picking the last of the zinnias to put in vases in the house and on the porch, I reworked the soil and added fertilizer to the buckets in which I had grown the scallions and zinnias and transplanted the carrots still too small to harvest to those buckets. Then I then pulled up the mostly dead lettuce, reworked and refertilized the soil in the lettuce container and the original carrots container -- and planted new lettuce seeds in both. It's a crapshoot but believe it or not, there's actually a chance I'll have lettuce, maybe even around the time the cucumbers and tomatoes are ready. Also on the good news front, or perhaps, more accurately, \"interesting\" news: My Pack Rat's boss has been a medieval warrior in the SCA for YEARS now. Finally, at long last, they're going to knight him -- this weekend at their festival of John Barleycorn. Me and my Pack Rat are going. I have a skirt and blouse with sandals outfit which, while it doesn't really look medieval, at least doesn't loudly scream \"Modern!\" If could have afforded it, I'd have bought some real garb (I saw some online), even if it would have \"only\" been a medieval peasant woman outfit. My Pack Rat once attended an SCA event (to see his boss fight) so he has a  \"just good enough\" monk costume. I can't help but find it hysterical -- HIM as a MONK when I know so much better! ;-) I guess I'll have to behave myself. LOL Anyhoo, today is the day (as soon as I finish this post and eat breakfast) I'm going to try to clean the house for the first time since just before my BMX -- so I come home to a clean house from a weekend away -- then off to my Pack Rat's nest, from where we begin the journey to North Salem, NY. OK, and now for the Bad News...(Note: I have an oncologist appointment on Wednesday of next week.) 1.  In spite of the rads, I have a major crop of skin mets on my abdomen and chest, a couple of them are on the irradiated area.  When I found them (a few days prior to my last RO visit), I was really upset feeling that I'd ruined my entire summer with rads SEs ALL FOR NOTHING. Remember, I did the rads because my onc and BS had told me if I had rads, it would postpone new skin mets for a few MONTHS?! And here I am finding them in the treated area TOO? They all started showing up about a week to week and a half after I stopped rads, so the RO has seen them. She (and my Pack Rat, who came with me for that appointment) STILL think it was good I did the rads, because if I hadn't, there'd be a lot more of them and they'd be BIG, too (they're smallish bumpy nodules). Hmmmm OK, if they say so. \"Regular\" oncologist gets to see them on Wednesday. 2.  I really do think that by now, there WILL be enough evidence to point a finger and announce \"this is what caused that ureter blockage\" back in July, and the evidence WILL be of peritoneal and/or retroperitoneal mets which closed up/blocked my ureters (the stents are working fine though). Now why do I think that? Because for the last three weeks I've started to get what I very strongly suspect is ascites -- my abdomen has been swelling up quite a lot even though I'm definitely not overeating (in fact, I have once again lost a noticeable amount of my appetite -- not all but a lot). I'm back to wearing my fat jeans even though I only weigh 120 pounds -- I can still put the skinny jeans ON and button them, but they're uncomfortable to wear. My fat jeans are actually still a little loose, but for now they're the best alternative (and I'm so glad the skirt I'm wearing as \"garb\" has an elastic waistline). My silly Pack Rat is telling me my \"fatness\" is just a matter of loss of muscle tone since I stopped regularly exercising -- no more daily walks, not even the \"short\" ones --  when the fatigue hit bad, and when I'm fully healed from rads, have all my energy back and start exercising again, it'll go away. BUT.... Peritoneal and retroperitoneal mets ARE a common cause of ascites, especially if cancer gets into the lymphatics (which mine did, as evidenced by the skin mets), AND, while at the time my scans didn't show definite evidence of it, I was told that just the fact of my being a metastatic BC patient meant we couldn't just rule out the POSSIBILITY. And now you're all probably going to ask me why I didn't call my oncologist about this a couple weeks ago when it started (which was just after I saw the RO) and am waiting to show/tell her about it at our regularly scheduled appointment on Wednesday. It's because a biopsy to confirm it and the draining of the fluid are done by a procedure called paracentesis, which involves a great big needle in the stomach. Supposedly it's done under a local, but you already know my history concerning locals for invasive procedures such as biopsies or catheterizations -- they're not nearly enough for me so it hurts like freakin hell. While draining will get rid of the fluid, ultimately the root cause (in my case, the likely peritoneal or retroperitoneal mets) has to be treated also, otherwise it'll just come back and come back. I'm supposed to be starting Faslodex soon, so that would be the \"treat the cause\" part of it, I'm still almost POSITIVE I'm going to get that horrible needle and the longer I can put it off, the better. See, the ascites is UGLY (makes me look fat like I did before I went on the diet) but it doesn't HURT. I'm not so sure I'll be able to say the paracentesis won't hurt! So THAT is why I haven't called the oncologist or tried to see her sooner. I'm sick of procedures that are more painful than the reasons why I need the procedure in the first place. Ummm hmmm...I wonder if there's a chance a diuretic (take a pill, no needle) will get rid of it. OK, well, that's all the news that's (un)fit to print from around here. Hope you all enjoy your weekends! ",

How did the procedure go? Do you know when you'll have results? Helen, I'm so glad to hear you're still walking. As you can probably tell from my disappearance from the 2011 walking thread, I just haven't been able to do it even though the weather here is still good for it, mostly (OK, today's rainy, but the last couple days were really nice).  I'm not AS tired as I was during rads, but now with the ascites it feels like -- this is going to sound real weird I'm sure -- like my insides are all being jounced around when I walk. That and getting short of breath. Well. Two more days, I think I can hang on till Thursday. I'm having the paracentesis then, so they can drain this shit out of me. They managed to fit it in with the procedure I was already scheduled for -- the nephrostomy tubes have to be changed (yes...this is going to be regular maintenance...). :-P Amy, OK, I hope this makes you laugh as much as it made me laugh. On Saturday morning, yes, my Pack Rat and I went out for breakfast and then to this guy's house in Vermont so he could buy the parts for his Samurai, and I finally did remember to give him the hug and pass on the message. It went like this: \"I need to give you a big hug, for me but also for Amy in my chemo group.\" We hugged (a great big one as far as my ascites would allow), and then I told him what you'd said about considering him an honorary member of our group. His reply was \"That doesn't mean I have honorary CANCER, I hope!\"  (I know he's weird, but that's his CHARM!) So the family problems concerning the wedding are sorta beginning to straighten out a little? That's good. Good luck on the run -- and be careful of your heart (you sure it's really OK to be doing this?). Wow... it just occurs to me that I haven't been ABLE to run since 1993. That's more than a decade and a half, isn't it? OK, gotta go, just wanted to pop in here for a few minutes.",

I sort of did that already years ago (that was one of the factors in my decision to leave the field of microbiology) but I got breast cancer anyway. Still though, stress relief alone is always a good thing. What I'd done was stop doing work I honestly cared about and got a job which was \"just okay\" and made just barely enough use of my skills to be tolerable enough to be able to stand doing it 40 hours per week so as to be able to earn my paycheck. I saved all my motivation, brains, heart and creativity for ME. This way I didn't care about the job or the company outside of business hours or think about it or being successful at it other than doing well enough to not get fired (losing the needed paycheck when it's the only way to pay your rent is also stressful).  I guess you missed the part several posts ago when I mentioned my onc officially gave me the 3 months-to-2-years to live estimate, huh? Yeah, maybe I'll exceed it, maybe I won't, but this was the first time I got one. My prior inquiries (both to her as well as my prior oncologist) were met with the more nebulous \"I don't know, we can't say\" reply, which you seem to be suggesting here. I guess kidney failure, peritoneal mets and ascites make it easier to provide a prognosis, huh? Even if it's not a particularly \"good\" one? Am bringing the iBook with me to the transfusion tomorrow so I still might post tomorrow (still so far so good on lack of physical injury from the car wreck though). Oh, and while I'm not enough of a fanatic about it to make my own, I do love to EAT barbeque! Yummmmm. BBQ ribs with duck sauce and Chinese food is one of my favorites. I'm also fond of honeyed BBQ chicken too. Yummmmmm......so if I'd been on that trip with you guys I'd probably have been enjoying the BBQ pig-out with your DH. HEADACHES? You'd waste lavender oil on headaches? When we all know the best use for such oils is erotic massage?!??! Take Tylenol (or Advil or aspirin) for the headaches and save the oil for your DH and give your daughters (particularly the one who just got married) some VALUABLE information! Puh-LEEEEZE! (on that note, I'm staring at the very big bottle -- 16 oz -- of almond oil my Pack Rat just bought for us the other day... hehehehe....",

So where do we start. Yeah the nodding off, which is where it all started when I wanted to get us all into that chat room Friday afternoon hoping our virtual talking behind her back would make her feel supported while they cut her open and started stealing her body parts. Well it got worse, the nodding off, no doubt because in addition to the Oxycodone/APAP which just totally changed  from \"Take 1-2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain,\" to full on Oxycodone \"Take 1-2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain AND *OxyContin* \"Take 1 tablet every 12 hours for pain.\" So that's a pretty serious change to two of my serious medications, and, it gets better...  --NOT!!-- See, Friday was also my ascites bag changing day. The changing of that dangitbag is so painful I involuntarily holler and scream even when pre-tanked on all my Oxys -- so the last two changes they told me to also tank up on morphine (i.e., take 0.25 mL liquid morphine by mouth in with the Oxys. Well whatever works huh? And this sure did; I only winced once throughout the whole procedure because something TICKLED! Yes I said tickled. I think it was when she (the nurse) was just cleaning/sanitizing the \"bag area\" in preparation to put on the clean new one. Of course and as usual, additional pain medicine helps the pain and destroys my brain. So there I am finally all re-bagged, clean and dry, feeling NO pain whatsoever and also entirely mentally dysfunctional (and that's how I show up to meet Geri and whoever else I hoped to catch in the chat room too, I should note). Oh yeah so that's where I was at, in that chat room -- drugged out of my mind and physically exhausted from my Bag Changing. I couldn't figure out what Geri's technical problem with the chat room was (and my being on all those damn drugs didn't really expect to be able to LOL) but I also lacked the common sense to stop chatting AT her as compared to WITH her. :-( She came and went, technical difficulties coming and going. I ended up nodding in and and out, literally falling asleep, jerking awake, nodding out again for a couple hours until I just had to get the hell off the computer and just give up and hope somebody ELSE could be around to help Betsy since I sure as hell couldn't. I simply continued to deteriorate for the remainder of the evening and through the weekend -- because I got totally confused with my new Oxy configuration and ended up taking the wrong medicines at the wrong times for three days solid, after which time I simply stopped taking EVERYTHING, PERIOD (and I bet that's why I didn't end up dead too). The more memorable events (most of which I found out after the facts from my Pack Rat and Nurse Donna): 1. Sunday or Monday \"night\"  (i.e., about 3 AM) Donna was at my house shouting my name and banging on the door for an hour to no avail -- I was just plain old oblivious alternating between totally passed out unconscious, or being 'awake' just walking into walls and losing my balance, zero awareness of my surroundings whatever the hell they were. 2. OK, so I knew the receiver for my landline had been AWOL for the past 3-4 days (and it still is), but the cell phone disappeared too and my Internet had gone down. Anyhoo I guess if nobody can reach me I should probably expect that Nurse Donna, whose emails I always answer, is going to freak out and make a frantic call to the motel in CT where my Pack Rat is staying (this has been his office workweek) when she can't get me on the phone AND I \"stop\" answering her emails to boot. My Pack Rat gives her my cell phone number. Why didn't *I* ever give it to her?  Because (until now) I never gave it to anybody except my Pack Rat and Tas. AND WHY IS THAT? More to come. Do you gals want a long interesting story or a short boring one? LOL 3. I lucked out -- the cell phone turned out to be in the computer room. Unless I actually know where I left it, there is no way on earth that little f***er can possibly ring for long enough for me to be able to locate it by where the sound is coming from. When you remember that for 12-15 years I used to do all my own audio engineering, plus occasional mixing and soundhecking for fellow musicians, and now can't tell where my cell phone is \"by ear\" unless it constantly rings for several unbroken minutes -- unless I at least have a clue where I left it last, well THAT must begin to clue you the depth and scope of my chemo brain. So Tuesday morning I happened to be going into the computer room from the bedroom (they're immediately adjacent) when I heard the cell start ringing and there it was on my computer desk. It was my Pack Rat wanting to get \"my side\" of the story (he had already spoken with Nurse Donna), find out how I was feeling and even though he gave her my cell number, tell me still I should call Donna ASAP and schedule an immediate home care visit as quickly as I could get one (I did: she was here Tues afternoon and we straightened a LOT of things out). 4. Yup, I most certainly did get confused about the new med configuration and instructions for taking. I lined up all my meds on the coffee table for Donna, we found where I went wrong (yup, with the \"new\" shorter acting Oxy and reorganized, together, my \"dispensary and storage system.\" So looks like I'm back on track now, taking the medicine I should take, when I'm supposed to be taking it, and climbing up and out of the train wreck. Oh, and also, about my chemo. Yes, Dr. C ultimately does want me on the 3-ring circus of 5-FU, M & C. The reason why she told me to stop taking the M & C after my 5-FU infusion was NOT financial even though this regimen given as palliative symptom treatment to a Stage IV patient with an expiration date IS every bit the financial/priority screwup I originally said it was -- it was because my labs drawn immediately prior to getting the 5-FU infusion were so bad that going back on the M & C would probably poison me! :-O Now that my Internet is up and running (enough anyway; it's still kinda on the wonky side) I'll have to head on down to my patient online test results section and find out what could be so bad they'd take me off chemo they really want me ON and which had been working.  Um....oh wait, no can't do that now can I? Mrs. Pack Rat sure as hell wouldn't, not for all the shinies a Pack Rat could possibly want. LOL 5. Last but Not Least: I Mostly Hate Cell Phones, But... Until August 2010 when my Pack Rat literally dragged me into Dollar General and held me by the arms facing the TracFone display until I chose one and purchased it (have I met my match in 'subtle' here? LOL), I didn't even own one of the damn things. While having had one for about two years now has (slightly) mellowed me -- I'm still not a huge fan. Yes they're good to take out with you in case you have to make an emergency call, and they're even convenient to have around when you're out grocery shopping and you see something funny (like that shelf full of bags of carbon free sugar) and just GOTTA tell your Pack Rat about it \"right now\" -- the good still \"counterbalances out\" with frequent poor audio quality (dropouts primarily), being very hard on older eyes and stroke addled fingers, having too many unnecessary \"features\" which are hard to learn if you have old eyes and stroke addled fingers and so on. So I'll call cell phones \"necessary evils\" (like how else could I have told my Pack Rat this past summer that I was about to be ambulanced to Dartmouth for kidney failure \"off-hours\" while he was working in CT? But y'know, my landline has actually been the worse inconvenience -- it's got superior audio quality....except I keep misplacing the receiver. When I bought it I was still living in the old apartment which had no stairs so I only needed a model with one receiver. In THIS place I need two due to the townhouse style layout. Cheapskate that I am, instead of buying a 2-receiver model, I keep filching the single one I have with the base, and as such, frequently misplace it. Not all that long ago my Pack Rat starts talking about how he's going to replace his landline with either his cell or Skype. His neighbor lives totally on cell, no landline at all. IMO the sound quality of Skype makes the cell phone dropping-outs sound great, would you believe that. A combination of my Pack Rat's switchover to Skype, all the related conversation and the astronomical amount on the check I wrote last night to pay my communications bill (a \"double hitter\" package which includes both the landline (unlimited voice comm and DSL high speed Internet) is beginning to waft through my system because I'm so tight on money and communications is the only place I really even have room to make cuts. I mean, not buying food or heating oil is NOT an option, and even though I never want to drive ever again, unfortunately I do have to buy another car (which means insurance as well as gasoline, maintenance and repairs over time-- but maybe if I get rid of the landline and only use the cell and DSL I could save a few bucks without TOO much pain...ya think? Any of you do this ever? Any of your family members or friends?  Did you like it? Did they? Was giving up the landline enough of a savings to make it seem worth it? Thanks and sorry for being such a pest. ;-) (BETSY:  Feel BETTER ASAP!). ",

      "Content": "Dec 8, 2009 12:35AM - edited Dec 8, 2009 12:39AM by Lena Okay girls -- I woke up in a frightful tizzy this morning because I had this dream last night:  I dreamed I was with my Pack Rat, at his aunt's house. We were all having a good time (me, him, his family) around the dining room table, eating home baked cookies, talking and so on. At one point, though, we were in the kitchen alone and we kissed and hugged. While he was hugging me, he ruffled and stroked my hair, and as I felt the immediacy of it, I realized:  I WAS TOPLESS! I DIDN'T HAVE MY WIG ON! I WAS HIDEOUS AND SHORT HAIRED! :-O I was totally horrified and embarrassed beyond belief! I mean, how it was I could have left my apartment to go anywhere without my wig on? I've been wearing my wig to go out, even just downstairs to get the mail, since my TRANSITIONAL pre-chemo haircut (March 2009), BEFORE the buzz (April 2009) and finally chemo with baldness! At the same time I'm feelintg this intense horrible embarrassment and questioning how I could have gone out without my wig, my Pack Rat is simultaneously telling me everything's okay and I have nothing to worry about, no one had noticed it before; he's trying to persuade me to go back into the dining room, to rejoin the others, with him. Reluctantly, I go back with him, but I felt...\"mutilated\" !!! I sat there with my head down, munching cookies and enjoying listening to the conversation around the table, but I couldn't bring myself to look up or speak. Then I woke up horrified! Anybody else having nightmares like this? Or, as I said in a post to my chemo group -- What ever happened to good old fashioned \"being stark naked in public\" nightmares? Hair update (4 months, 2 weeks PFC): 1. On my head: definitely hair now, it's coming in brown, but it's still way too short to consider going out topless. Although I did get brave while doing the laundry today (laundry room is in the basement of my apartment building): I wore my hooded sweatshirt with the hood up instead of putting on my wig. But when I had to go outside to play \"musical cars,\" I did put on my wig. 2. Brows and lashes: brows look to be all in, in but still mostly colorless. Lashes look to be about 75% of normal. 3. Underarms and legs: Need to shave underarms once or twice a week now. Legs still nothing, but that's how they were for several years before cancer anyway. 4. Nether region: Finally! I'm starting to get some very short hair down there! Trish, that's an excellent question you ask, about what we think when we see short haired women out and about while going about our own business. Before chemo, seeing women with short hair forced me to remember that all people are individuals and have different tastes and aesthetic preferences. See, I don't LIKE short hair on ANYBODY: those who have pretty faces can pull it off and look OK, but IMO anyone who is passable with short hair is or would be drop dead gorgeous with LONG hair! That means men too -- I STILL like long hair on men, although I don't see much of it. Me personally: I can NOT pull off short hair; I need long hair to make me PRESENTABLE. Now that you know my severe bias in favor of long hair, you'll understand my reactions to seeing short haired women in public -- the idea that their hair might be short because of chemo never occurred to me back then -- my initial reaction would be, \"Why would anybody CHOOSE to look like that?\" At which point I'd have to scream \"Tolerance!\" at myself and the reminder, \"Not everybody is YOU, Lena, other people rightfully have their own ideas on what makes them look good!\" Now that I've had the chemo and lost my hair, hahaha, I do wonder if they went through that too, I mean, after all, \"Why would anybody CHOOSE to look like that?\" -- so once again I scream \"Tolerance!\" at myself and issue the same self-reminder! LOL! ~Lena.",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2009 01:22AM Lena wrote: Wow, I finally found this thread -- I'd seen Chelev, one of my April 2009 chemo group sisters, several times make reference to a \"Hair Hair Hair\" thread in our chemo group's thread, but never bothered to check this one because of the \"Another question\" tacked on the end. So, this is it huh? LOL Oh, and did I see Dawn here too? Cool! Hi! :-) OK, to everyone who said that one's hair is a part of their identity -- YES!!!! Truer words were never spoken -- that is exactly how I felt about my hair pre-chemo. My pre-chemo hair was long (only an inch or two shy of my waist), mostly chestnut brown with maybe 2-3 greys I could see (I turned 48 in June), and slightly wavy. It was possible to render it straight with a blowdryer (except I stopped blowdrying years ago), but after I stopped blowdrying it, I discovered that combing it out with a fine tooth comb while it dried naturally made it a little less wavy, almost straight even. No, I don't much care for waves or curls, and when the mold on my head (to me it looks like there's mold growing on my head!) starts to become hair, I hope it WON'T be curly! But the main thing about my pre-chemo hair which was not just my identity but the only physical beauty I had left of what little there was, was how LONG it was! Not only have I always hated short hair (I had it once when I was 11, some kids at school put chewing gum in my hair, my mom couldn't get it out despite 3 hours of trying so she ended up giving me a really short pixie cut and I was hideous for the 3 years it took to get to my shoulders, and I wasn't pretty until it got halfway down my back 5 years post-pixie), but I didn't even like to wear my hair tied back in a pony tail -- I need it to \"surround\" me and frame my face to look pretty -- so I wore it long and loose. Needless to say, the chemo hair loss thing has been serious emotional trauma for me -- not just because of the time since the pre-chemo buzz cut and being bald during the chemo, but for how long it's going to take me to feel presentable again (without a wig, that is, and although I do look good in my wigs, they're a pain in the neck). My hair always grew slowly before chemo, so I don't expect it to grow any faster now. :-( Today I'm 10 weeks PFC (I did 6 rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxan/Taxotere from April 9th through July 23rd), and I've been taking Tamoxifen since July 30th. Someone mentioned wondering if Tamox was slowing down her hair regrowth; I don't know if its affecting mine because like I said, my hair always grew slowly, so I don't expect anything else BUT agonizing slowness. I've been calling myself Fuzzie the Moldie since the peach fuzz started (about 6 weeks PFC I think) because to me the peach fuzz looked like mold mycelium (I'm an ex-microbiologist -- mostly worked with bacteria but also with some yeast and mold), and then when color started coming in, my immediate thought on noticing it was, \"I'm sporulating!\" (to identify a mold species, the first most important characteristic is the color, which comes from the spores). Anyhoo -- I presently seem to have a good deal of mold growing on the top of my head, less on the sides. There isn't enough of it to comb even -- I guess I should be \"glad\" I don't have the tangling issues to deal with (I used to condition the heck out of my hair pre-chemo, and as soon as I finished drying off after my shower, comb it out with the wide-tooth comb right away so it wouldn't have time to get tangled!) -- but I don't care -- I'd gladly trade the 5 minute showers I've been able to take since my pre-chemo buzz cut for the 20-25 minute ones I used to take when I had all that hair to wash and condition! Anyhoo -- about hair products -- oh, and yeah, someone here mentioned L'Oreal buying up all the product lines they liked and being mad about it -- please don't throw anything at me, OK? When I went into a work transition of getting out of microbiology and trying to get into office work, I ended up with one last lab tech position -- at L'Oreal USA. I worked in the Compatibility lab, which was a function between the R&D and Packaging departments -- Compatibility's responsibility was to test various formulations of product with various formulations of packaging. And, the relevant part: when there was extra bulk (shampoo, conditioner, hair dye, perfume, lipstick, eye shadow, mascara, etc.), we in the lab were allowed to take it home for our own personal use. I was never much into the makeup thing, but I gladly accepted the opportunity to end up with enough shampoo and conditioner to last three years without having to buy any -- I shit you not! I really didn't have to buy hair products for three years, even though I only worked at L'Oreal for a little over a year and a half. My favorites of the shampoos and conditioners were Biolage and Redken -- they were wonderful. After I finished all those up and had to buy shampoo and conditioner again, I ended up with Pantene (my next door neighbor's niece recommended it). I liked it -- not as much as the Biolage or Redken -- but better than what I'd used prior to getting the Biolage and Redken freebies (Wella Balsam). I didn't buy Biolage or Redken because I never saw it in the supermarket health and beauty section -- I guess that means you have to buy it in a salon...which means I'll probably never buy it. I used to go to a salon for split ends trimming until the hairdresser got scissors-happy on me. After that, I only went to get the pre-chemo buzz, since, while my friend Kym can do a basic short cut, split ends and bangs trims, practically shaving someone's head is out of her league. And, presuming I live long enough, when my hair grows back enough to need split ends and bangs trims, I'll just invite Kym over for dinner (or take her out to lunch or something) and she'll be happy to trim for me again. Sooo, since I'd stocked up on shampoo/conditioner maybe a month or two prior to my diagnosis, I'm washing my mold with the Pantene shampoo since that's what's here. Not conditioning it because it's not long enough to comb or tangle. But the conditioner is at the ready for when my Pack Rat washes his beautiful long blond hair here. ;-) I don't know if I'm going to color my new hair -- depends how much grey there is. Right now I can't tell. I don't look at it obsessively (because I can't stand the way I look, I go out of my way to avoid the mirror as much as possible), but when I do look at it, I honestly have no idea what the color is. It seems a little bit lighter than my pre-chemo color, but I'm not really sure. Well, it doesn't matter, since I can't so much as open my apartment door (much less go out in public) bareheaded unless I live long enough for it to get to the bottom of my shoulders -- at which time I'll know if I need to color it or not. I used to color my hair when I was much younger (when I was 15-29) -- strawberry blonde. It looked great on me, but towards the end I got sick of being a \"roots slave\" and stopped -- I let most of it grow out, then dyed it to my natural color.. Also it was about that time when I thought that maybe if I stopped damaging my hair with ammonia-containing dye and blowdrying, it would get \"healthy\" enough to grow longer (while I was a bottled strawberry blonde who blow dried her hair, it only grew to halfway down my back maximum. Well I was onto something; no hair dye, no blow dry, extra condining, gentle treatment with the wide tooth comb got it to grow down to my waist! And I liked my natural chestnut brown better than the strawberry blonde after all! Mmmm, other hair stuff: Brows and lashes -- I have mycelium eyebrows (no sporulation yet), and stubby beginnings of eyelashes. No leg hair (but that was gone way before I got breast cancer), no underarm hair, and no....\"bikini\" hair -- so that's what you call it in this thread huh? LOL! I was calling it \"downstairs hair\" in the chemo group thread -- since I don't wear bikinis, I guess that expression wouldn't have occurred to me! I don't care about the eyebrow/eyelash hair, I don't mind the lack of armpit hair, but I do wish my \"bikini\" hair would grow back. Like I said to the girls in my chemo group, it bothers me to look like a 6-year-old girl \"down there!\" (I am a 48 year old WOMAN!) So yeah, 10 weeks PFC and I guess I'm going to have to tell my Pack Rat he'll need to drum up some wild fanatasies of molesting a first grader for longer than we thought if \"that\" hair doesn't come back soon. There's no peach fuzz even. ;-P Trish -- you're the one whose nurse made the totally uncalled-for insensitive remark about being \"obsessed\" with your hair? Well, I think my oncologist is in her league. I know he was trying to be funny, and I also know that many patients there like him for his sense of humor. I usually find him funny too, but he said a couple things to me which I did NOT find funny -- and I gave him dirty looks both times saying, \"Not funny!\" His comments -- this was over the course of two office visits while I was undergoing my chemo. And yes, I was wearing my \"good\" wig (custom wig made from real human hair; this wig is halfway down my back and very close to my pre-chemo natural color) Comment #1: \"Wow, your hair''s growing back so FAST!\" At that time, under the wig, I was totally hideously bald like some kind of monster larva! :-O Comment #2 (at our next appointment, yes I was still doing chemo): Your new hair looks better than your real hair did.\" He lucked out because i was too weakened and space-headed from the chemo to punch him out! Catch you another time -- and may you all grow the hair of your dreams!  ~Lena. ",

I guess I should really have said goodbye first or something, but I haven't been coming to BCO much lately because there's too much \"sunshine,\" that is, positivity and prayer stuff -- which works for most of you which is fine, but it just depresses and irritates the heck out of me. Also, now that I'm 4 rounds in (just had #4 ACT this past Thursday, 6/11/09, two more to go), the chemo brain has gotten so bad I can hardly post anyway -- a friggin' gnat has more of an attention span and ability to mentally focus than I do. And that's during the 25% of any given day I have the energy to do something other than lie on the couch watching Star Trek DVDs. So what little I've got left I'm saving for my Sims.   Apparently this crap is cumulative -- I did well with my first round, not too bad with my second, but I haven't been myself at all since the third (i.e., no snapping back to even a remote reflection of myself after the first week post-infusion). The person I used to be is dead and gone, with this awful stupid hideous sexless creature in her place. I knew I was dead when I realized I'd stopped thinking about sex. I know the difference between wanting it but being too tired or busy to do anything about it and just not being \"in the mood\" (which was, until my second chemo, practically never), but not to even THINK about it?! For WEEKS?! :-O Yeah, I'm definitely dead and gone. And what a hideous corpse I am with no hair, too. :-P   Been reading the rest of your stories intermittently though. As always, I'm sorry to hear about the nasty SEs some of you are having, and I hope you all get through it somehow, and that the SEs go away.   All the best,   ~Lena.",

I mean, my Neulasta shots only hurt while I'm actually receiving them (no subsequent bone pain from them); my nails aren't turning weird colors and falling out; while my mouth usually TASTES yucky, I haven't had any SORES; I only had ONE episode of 'breakthrough nausea\" so far (and I didn't actually go so far as to throw up); my white count only dropped to dangerously low levels once so far...and my weight has stayed in its normal range.   Chelev, I did read awhile back that you stopped chemo \"prematurely\" -- since your chemo SEs were much worse than mine -- and in your shoes I'd have stopped chemo too -- I think you did the right thing. I'm glad you're almost done with your radiation (what a nightmare though, it sounds almost as bad as chemo!). I still don't know if my doctor will want to put me on radiation...I think it'll depend on what happens during my surgery. Oh, and what you said here:   \"I feel bad for my husband, who has been wonderful these last 5 months, but it has to be hard on him, not only because I am no longer thinking about sex anymore, and more than that, who would want to look at me?\"   And what Nadine said:   \"We are the only ones who truly understands loosing what we felt was our womanhood and that includes our boob(s), hair, weight gain, no energy and the list goes on.  As far as sex the hardest thing I had to do is tell hubby I had no sex drive.  Hubby never asked nor pushed but I felt I had to tell him the truth.  He told me that since I was sick it hadn't entered his mind.\"   Boy have you two ever got THAT straight! I am so glad I'm not married, and (for the first time in the 6-and-a-half years we've been together) also glad that my Pack Rat and I are in a long distance relationship -- so he doesn't have to see me like this day in and day out!    I think THAT must be the reason why he can be so good about this...and I am totally shocked at the extent of it (he was here last week). But since he hasn't changed his phoning habits, it's not like I haven't told him what's going on (or even that it's been anything outside of his claimed expectations when I originally told him about my illness and what treatment would entail)....back then, and in the earlier part of my treatment when I wasn't quite this far gone, he kept assuring me that (as far as my femininity/sexual desirability were concerned) that going bald and losing my breast were NO BIG DEAL for him, breast or no breast he wants me anyway and my hair will grow back after I finish my chemo.  He even encouraged me to go flat on the right after my mastectomy when I told him I didn't like what I had learned about, and was strongly leaning against, reconstruction (extra surgery and more pain/protracted disability and recovery time even if I DON'T have complications, beyond the medically necessary removal of my diseased right breast). So he made it EASY for me to officially decide on no reconstruction. And then when I told him how I'd stopped thinking about sex and it made me feel like the living dead, he said not only did he understand, but he also suggested that maybe he could \"inspire\" me (but would understand if I was too tired or not want to).   So last week he was here for a few days (which included my birthday). Though we talk on the phone a lot between visits so he was up to date on my current feelings and doings, this was the first time he actually got to SEE The Creature I became. The last time he was here before this I still had hair -- short and ugly, but I wasn't yet a complete and total unsightly eyesore (or as brain dead) as I got and still am. Even though he'd repeatedly SAID it wouldn't faze him even slightly (and told me I was worrying over \"nothing\" if I thought my condition and appearance would scare him off), I was still not planning to show it to him in full. That is, I knew I couldn't sleep with my wig on, but since I can and usually do sleep wearing my scarf, I took some very small comfort in the fact that I didn't have to let him see me bald. My right breast has been misshapen since before I started chemo, and that doesn't bother me nearly as much, I haven't had a single problem with him seeing my naked BODY on account of that -- but BALD? NO WAY I told myself. But he said he WANTED to see! He lies down on the bed naked and smiling in invitation; I got naked except for the scarf (I took off the wig and put my scarf on in the bathroom with the door shut, then took off the rest of my clothes in the bedroom). My first response to him saying he wanted to see my naked HEAD was to tell him I'd rather not since I'd never heard him previously mention having sexual fantasies about bald women, to which he says, \"Why don't you give me a CHANCE to?\"  So I decided to be \"brave\" and take off the scarf, but the moment I did (and caught a glimpse of myself in the dresser mirror), I was in tears. He was instantly sitting up and hugging me, telling me over and over again to relax and how it wasn't bad at all and yes he still wanted me!  :-O   And (although I only went openly bald in front of him that first night and wore the scarf for the rest of our visit, because *I* still can't stand the sight of myself), while he was here I got to find out that while no I don't have my once overabundant and extremely vigorous sexual energy to \"do it\" every single night, yes it IS possible for him to \"inspire\" me and, everything still works (including orgasm; no energy for my former multiples but I can enjoy one at least, and somehow \"only one\" is now actually enough!). I also found out (not surprisingly though given my severe fatigue) that for what sex we're going to have while I'm on chemo, HE has to do most of the ravishing. I only had the energy to actively ravish him once -- our visits before chemo not only did we do not just more often, but equal mutual amounts of who ravishes who.   You're probably all wondering how I could have been such a raving sex maniac but still be able to accept a long distance relationship -- besides that I'm just plain weird (and that other than his geographic undesirability, he's everything I ever wanted in a man) -- chalk it up to a fantastically vivid and emotive-visceral imagination to go along with my skilled right hand. The vivid imagination died when the chemo brain set in, naturally, so maybe THAT'S why I stopped thinking about sex...and since my Pack Rat went back to his Nest in the North (plus *I* have to see and deal with The Creature day in and day out), I'm back to total zero sex drive. But if last week is any indication, at least it'll come back a little when I have my Pack Rat's direct \"inspiration\" (maybe in a couple more weeks, since on July 1st he starts his new job, which is four hours closer than his Nest).   hrf, you really and truly hit the nail on the head here too:   \"But when you don't know who you are anymore and the person looking at you in the mirror is a \"blob\" who has no physical resemblance to who you used to be, it's enough to make you lose hope for anything.\"   Amen, sister! You took the words right out of my mouth! And I'm so glad you finished your chemo. I hope you get yourself back really soon!   Back to Nadine for a moment....about anti-depressants....dunno if I'll go on any yet. But if anti-depressants don't help the damn chemo brain, which limits my ability to do some of the things I enjoy (being really active on my forums, email correspondence, playing my sims) and totally precludes others of them entirely (everything creative and/or requiring attention to detail), which if only I could do in full, would make me feel a lot better -- I don't see what good they'll do me. My oncologist had from the start recommended I see a psychiatrist. My cancer center is part of a regional medical center which includes a behavioral/psychiatric department, so I made an appointment there. As it happened, I got a counselor right away, and I've been going for counseling every 2-3 weeks (depending on my chemo schedule: I can't go anywhere during my first week post-infusion and only barely manage to get my Neulasta shots), but it's just \"talk counseling\" and I don't feel it's helping (other than his recommendation that I apply for Social Security Disability on account of my Stage IV IBC, which I did). He tells me everything I'm feeling is \"normal\" for someone in my position -- okay fine, but being told it's normal to feel like shit doesn't make me feel BETTER. The actual psychiatric evaluation (by a \"real psychiatrist\" who can prescribe medication, as compared to the psychotherapist I've been seeing) -- earliest date they could give me for that was June 18th, which is tomorrow. So tomorrow morning I'll find out if I \"need\" anti-depressants, and if I do, what kind I can even TAKE that won't interreact badly with my chemo cocktail/Neulasta shots/anti-nausea meds.   Paula -- with a family like yours, you don't need enemies! How horrible! And even though your husband is like my boyfriend in that he still loves and wants you anyway, I still feel like my boyfriend was only \"just saying it.\" I guess it's really true that we need to feel for OURSELVES that we're beautiful and feminine, that no matter how much our men say we're still desirable as women, it doesn't matter unless WE think that's true.   Well OK...it took me 5 1/2 hours and 3 cups of coffee to write this post and now I have to go eat something and lie down for the rest of the day so I can hopefully endure having to go out to the headshrinker tomorrow. (Just going downstairs to get the mail has become an ordeal!)   Thank you all again for your understanding and empathy, and I wish all your darn SEs would go away!   ~Lena.  ",

My heart is with you.   Thursday 7/23/09, the day after tomorrow, I go in for Round 6 of 6.  But no cartwheels for me, thank you. Heck, I get hit with instant fatigue just from getting up from the couch or my desk chair even...and, I've never done a cartwheel in my life anyway.   Wish I could say I was looking forward to Thursday, but I'm not. Every time they hit me with this stuff, it knocks me on my ass harder and longer. I'm so sick of being brain dead and feeling like crap all the time. Since my third treatment, I've had only one good week out of three, and the \"good\" is relative (I'm still fatigued, brain dead,  and having hot flashes like crazy) but my appetite comes back and food almost starts to taste like food) -- I haven't felt like Me at all. Unless, of course, feeling like crap all the time is the New Me, and I have to accept it. :-P    Saw my oncologist today, and yes, the swollen feet I got a few days out from my last treatment is from the Taxotere. He prescribed me a diuretic and potassium supplements which I start taking tomorrow morning, so I hope it helps. The swelling is asymmetrical -- left foot/lower leg pretty bad (I almost can't put my left shoe on), right foot/lower leg only slightly noticeable. Six months I'm told is how long it'll take for all the chemo side effects to go away-- oh no, 6 MORE months without my brain?!  :-O   Here's a Chemo Brain story for you all: I was cooking a hamburger for dinner, and while the burger was cooking, I peeled an onion (I like onion on my hamburgers). Soon as I got it peeled I'm thinking it's time to turn the burger over, so I turn around, pick up the spatula, flip the burger, turn around again, and...I CAN'T FIND THE ONION. I search and search my tiny little kitchen until I'm in a tizzy. By the time I find the onion, the burger is done. Guess where I found the onion, too -- IN A DIRTY COFFEE CUP IN THE KITCHEN SINK! :-O   I hope they give me some time to at least partially recover from the chemo and not rush me onto the operating table.   Congrats to those of you who are (FINALLY!!) done with this shit, and for those who are still mired in it, I wish you as few side effects as possible!   ~Lena.    ",

I had my last TAC a week ago today.    I know, those of us who are finished only have one place to go from here in terms of our side effects going away -- UP! Another patient at the cancer center today told me about this (said she's 2 months out of chemo  -- she did 6 rounds of TAC too, just like me, and is feeling way better now and said I will too) to reasssure me. And wow, she looked so beautiful. Since she was neither openly bald nor wearing a scarf I  figure she was probably wearing a wig still (hell, I was wearing MY wig! LOL), but she looked so healthy as well as pretty, and she seemed so...energetic and vibrant!  (while I'm there paler than a ghost, holding onto the reception desk feeling dishrag weak and getting a little dizzy just standing while we wait for the receptionist to get back so we can tell her we're here). I only wish I could believe what she told me!  What is it about chemo anyway, that even when you know it's only temporary (you'll only be on it for a few months), it totally kills your sense of objectivity so as to make you FEEL like you're going to feel and look like crap for the rest of the time you have on this earth?!    I'm so happy for those of you who've been off chemo a bit and have actually started your journeys UP and AWAY from feeling and looking awful. (Chelev! Hair starting to grow back!? WOO HOO!!!!!)   Wish I could say my journey to the UP place has started, but apparently I need more time. That last treatment hit me like a megaton nuclear warhead, and a whole week out I feel just as crappy and worse than ever -- my appetite isn't back at all yet, and what small amounts I struggle to make myself eat anyway (scrambled egg or hot cereal for breakfast and a microwaved can of Chunky soup for dinner) doesn't really taste like food yet (this used to begin abating by Day 5-6 on the average but now it's Day 7 and still just as bad as when it originally hit)....still zero energy, brain's still totally dead, still have hot flashes, no sexual desire and my mouth tastes like a sewer. Oh, and did I mention being exhausted from the moment I get out of bed in the morning?   Well, at least the diuretic is working on my Taxotere Feet. My right foot/ankle is back to normal, and while the left foot/ankle is still swollen, it HAS gotten smaller.   New Chemo Brain Story for you all: my keychain holds all my keys, which consist of the key to get into my apartment building, the mailbox key, two keys to get into my apartment (deadbolt up top, regular on bottom) and my car key.  Well, I go downstairs to get the mail (the only time I don't lock the apartment) one afternoon last week. The next morning at 11:30, my doorbell rings. It's a guy saying I left my keys in the door!  :-O   Other than that...well, Titan asks us chemo finishers about our Phase 2 plans, and I guess now is good timing because the reason why I was at the cancer center today is because I had an appointment with my oncologist and once he examined me, we discussed my Phase 2. I got a couple of surprises, actually...and I'm going to have to do some online research today or tomorrow. Here it is:   1. I got a prescription for Tamoxifen today, which I start taking tomorrow. No real surprise here though, because I've known my tumor is hormone positive since I got the biopsy result. Oh, and while the chemo did shrink it considerably, it's definitely still THERE -- we didn't actually get RID of it. Dunno about how it worked on my mets though, which brings us to:   2. I'm getting almost totally re-scanned: CT (chest/abdomen/pelvis), PET (whole body), Bone and MUGA scans, to both see how I compare with my pre-chemo scans (apparently I don't need a Brain MRI this time, though I had one of those too originally: came up negative for brain mets but he could see the aftermath of my stroke from 15 years ago), and also so he can determine if he wants me to have rads (surprise! nobody told me I might need rads, just the chemo!)) or even the mastectomy (BIG surprise!). Scanning dates are all going to be between 8/18 and 8/25/09, and after that I have an appointment with him on 9/10/09 for an exam and us to discuss the scan results, how I'm doing on the Tamoxifen and his recommendations based on that. He also says he's considering he may eventually want to put me on Zometa too (surprise!), but again, he wants to see my scan results etc. before he makes any decisions. Works for me!   I was shocked as all hell when he said I MIGHT not have to have the mastectomy, which I'd thought was going to be my absolute Phase 2! I mean he told me initially that I had to go on chemo to shrink the tumor enough so they could do a mastectomy at all! Um, well, now the word is that since I'm Stage IV (I presented that way) and my tumor never got \"messy\" (i.e., it never ulcerated or broke out of the skin of the breast), a mastectomy MIGHT not be needed. He says Stage IV patients don't  necessarily always need mastectomies unless they DO get \"messy\" like that. But he's also thinking maybe (depending on the scan results which \"resize\" the breast tumor, and how my mets are, namely if the chemo killed them...which I doubt, since my hip still hurts sometimes) -- if scans show the mets are gone or near gone, he thinks rads might shrink the breast tumor even more, and in that case I should have rads and the mastectomy so maybe have a shot at an actual remission. (Which yes, I know would be temporary anyway, being a Stage IV, but I'd REALLY like to be Myself again before I die!)   Well, I'm glad I'll have some TIME to begin to get over the chemo before anything drastic happens (oh yeah, today's blood test result: my platelets, red AND white blood cells are ALL on the Endangered Species List! Wonder if THAT'S why I still feel so lousy?!). Next Project: need to look up Tamoxifen side effects and read up on Zometa...   Try to feel better, everyone!  {{HUGS}}   ~Lena.        ",

Did you have the energy to do a cartwheel?   Wow, are we ALL done now?   I'm 2 weeks PFC (um, PFC = Post F***ing Chemo, right? LOL) as of tomorrow -- still not enough recovery time for me. I shouldn't still be THIS tired and spaced out still, should I?   Gotta laugh about suggestions to use magnifying glasses to see if hair's growing in, but I find the old cliche, \"a watched pot never boils\" is pretty true in my experience. It certainly was true regarding my swollen Taxotere Feet issue! When I first started taking the diuretic my oncologist gave me for that, well, the first few days I'd look at my feet carefully every day to see if the swelling was going away, and couldn't notice a difference, so I just stopped looking for a few days. Then I noticed my right foot was back to normal, but though the left one was still swollen, it was smaller than I remembered from the last time I looked at it...so I stopped looking again until today, and now the left foot is only SLIGHTLY swollen (kind of like my right foot was originally). Cool. I'll check it again Saturday or Sunday at this point -- maybe by THEN it'll be back to normal or close to it, and I'll have something to be happy about, instead of staring at it every day... \"whaaat? not yet?\"  ;-)   Which means, I'm not even going to bother scrutinizing my horrid head at all. I'll just have to wait for my hair to come back when it comes back (and not look for any signs that it might be on its way:). That should be easy enough, since the sight of myself in a mirror makes me shudder and as such I've been pretty much avoiding the mirror like the plague ever since the pre-chemo buzz cut anyway. The only time I DELIBERATELY look in a mirror, other than while straightening my wig if I have to go out, is when I brush my teeth and look to make sure I \"got\" everything! LOL. Anyway, I know I'm going to be totally unsightly without a wig for a very long time yet (i.e., until I can retire the wig, which won't be until my hair gets to the bottom of my shoulders), so I don't see the point in making myself depressed on purpose by looking at peach fuzz and brand new half inch or one inch worth of hair. Only one inch of hair isn't going to look any better on me than bald.  :-P   ~Lena.",

Hope that last Neulasta is bearable for you, and you climb out of the hole faster than I am! (Eeesh, will you even notice it while doing rads?! you poor thing!)   ROFLMAO Titan, my avatar picture isn't a real picture of me, it's a picture of my SIM! I play The Sims, and had made sims of me and my Pack Rat. Yes, I made my sim to look as much like me as possible, and yes, I did have long (almost waist length) brown hair for real (and wore it loose like that)...and yes, IRL I use Macintosh computers like my sim is using in the avatar pic, but no, that's not an actual real live pic of me. My sim looks MOSTLY like I did (when I still had my hair), but not 100%. For reasons of both privacy and vanity, I don't post real pictures of myself on the Internet, period. Never have and never will.   Hope your Monday last chemo goes well for you too Leslie, and that you climb out faster than I am!   Paula -- glad to hear your husband is feeling well enough to WANT to go back to work. Um, do you HAVE TO participate in that study? Just because your oncologist wants you to doesn't mean you have to, do you?   BetsyBuzz, kudos to you for not having my psychological hangup about hair. I wonder if this made the general chemo experience even a LITTLE \"easier\" for you than for me (I hope it did!).  I am so frickin embarrassed by my hideous bald head I can't even open my apt door without putting my wig on first. About your male coworkers with shaved heads -- I myself have seen plenty of healthy people who voluntarily shave their heads, plus I also know there are people who, even though they have hair on their own heads, find baldness on others ATTRACTIVE...but I still think it's ugly as sin. I mean it's their heads and their opinions which they're entitled to just as much as I am to mine and I can accept it on that basic abstract level (\"to each his own\")...but to my eyes, bald is just too ugly for words and the emotional reaction is so strong I simply cannot fathom why anybody with a choice would deliberately do that to themselves. Even \"no maintenance\" isn't enough of a reason for me. Initially I tried to see SOMETHING which could be construed as, if not GOOD, at least maybe not so BAD about it.  Like, being able to take quick showers -- no hairwashing or conditioning, and no more 2 hours post-shower combing it out with the wide tooth comb to make sure it dries straight and untangled before I can go to bed...but even the \"no maintenance\" factor and all the shower time I'm saving has never been anywhere NEAR worth being this embarrassingly ugly...and I totally hate the FEEL of the towel on my bald head after my shower, too...   Well, enough no-hair ranting (sorry, did it again, maybe next time I'll be in better control)...gotta go...everybody feel as well as you can -- especially our last finishers Titan and Leslie!   ~Lena.    ",

Thing is with my balance issue, it's extremely difficult for me to walk on uneven ground, and with all the snow/slush/ice piles, well even though the sidewalks got shoveled, there's hardly any way to get from them to the street which doesn't mean getting knee deep in snow and semi melted slush. I fell a couple times -- didn't get hurt but now I'm really scared to go out again until all this freakin' crap MELTS AWAY GONE!  I HATE WINTER! I HATE SNOW! On the phone last night, my Pack Rat asked me what I'm doing on Saturday night -- hahahaha, yeah right, I never go outside after dark by myself (even when it ISN'T winter!) and he knows it, so I said \"Same thing I do every other Saturday night, why, what's special about Saturday night?\" and he says \"Well Sunday is Valentine's Day, you know, so I thought I'd come down on Saturday night...\" So I'm floored -- he is NOT the traditionally romantic type (no flowers, no sweet words etc., OK I'm not either all that much but I do have my unconventional romantic side, which he laughs at and puts up with because he finds it amusing)...and here he is saying he wants to come down here for VALENTINE'S DAY? And all I can say -- probably because all I've seen in the mirror since my pre-chemo haircuts last year has been one form or other of this disgusting gross sickening looking creature which IMO roadkill is sexier than -- is, \"Wow, you mean you still like me THAT way?\" And he says, \"Will you be my Valentine?\" My eyes bugged out. I almost fainted...but I said yes. So I got a Pack Rat coming over Saturday night, and he has Monday off work, which means I get to keep him till early Tuesday morning...wonder if I'll manage to go back into heat when he gets here..I hope. ;-) ~Lena. ",

GRRRR. Still though, the MidNite is not any worse, and, (a) I don't need a prescription for it, and (b) I was on the other one so long I really SHOULD take a break from it anyway. So, is the melatonin helping you any? Titan -- Diamonds?! Um, whoa! did you get any? that's definitely not US! ...my Pack Rat gave me a wireless router (:-D YAY! my new DSL is now playing nice with my Ethernet network, and, I can go high speed wireless online in the living room with my iBook now too, legally LOL), a box of chocolates (for the first time ever, probably because this was the first time I'd have ever actually appreciated that; I've never been much of a chocolate fan but after I quit smoking I finally picked up a little of a sweet tooth!) and a bunch of pairs of warm fuzzy socks in various colors.

She says, \"You're very angry,\" but says it's OK, she understands and sits down/talks with me while. Did it make me feel better? Ehhhhh, Temporarily maybe. It calmed me down a little but all the reasons for me to BE upset are still with me. I am STILL sorry I went through treatment and I wish I WAS literally dead/had something to make me dead quick and painless. I'm still not the person I used to be, I still hate what I became, I'm still hideous and so on -- so nothing has changed. Except of course now we can add the broken coccyx (from when I fell down the stairs a couple weeks ago) and the mysterious blood clot. The onc still doesn't know why I have the blood clot: says it COULD be the cancer, or it COULD have been the Tamoxifen, or it COULD even be something else but I'm off all prescription meds for now and he wants to see me in a couple weeks (for what, I dunno. Maybe to find out if he has a clue?). He had more blood taken. Next appointment is 3.15.10. Oooh, idea! :-)  Maybe a nice piece of that clot'll break off, escape from my spleen and kill me fast and easy with a nice stroke in the brain stem this time I hope just like that former co-worker's husband...  Chelev --  OMG OUCH, those hives sound awful!!  :-O And you know what, I'm beginning to wonder also how long it takes Tamoxifen SEs to go away -- I stopped taking my Tamoxifen as per my onc last week but I'm still having those horrible hot flashes!  I didn't get hives (well not from meds anyway), so I don't think I'm allergic to it (unless blood clots are some weird new sign of allergies I didn't know about), but, I stopped taking it too and am wondering if maybe I'll go back to \"normal\" except my cancer will go out of control. Well let us know when the hives start to abate and you feel better -- I hope that's soon. ~Lena. ",

I actually remember way too much from my early childhood -- the only real \"memory block\" was when my mother was pregnant with my sister, who was born when I was 2 1/2. I actually remember lying in a crib playing with mobiles swinging over my head, and being in a baby carriage (strapped in and screaming, screaming, screaming because I wanted OUT! and nobody would let me out!). One of the only things I don't remember from when I was that little was Seeing Mom with a Big Tummy -- and that's actually the story that sets the basic tone of my entire life here.  My father told me this story of my Ancient Childhood when I was a teenager, as a way to explain what he had for years called my charming \"poisonality,\" and although years later we parted ways (I \"divorced\" my whole family because they drove me nuts). The following happened while my mother was about 6 months pregnant with my sister.... ...We were at my grandmother's apartment (Mom's mom).  Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa were sitting in the living room, talking and having coffee. I was running around and yelling like any other obnoxious two-year-old (derogatory description of toddlerhood is mine). Then, the doorbell rang. I flung it open. It was a friend of my grandmother's who picked me up and (my dad's description) -- picked me up, hugged and kissed me. Important note: MY description/opinion of that -- she made one of those horrible disgusting \"cutesy\" huggie kissie fusses over a stupid little brat, and BTW I also HATED being on the receiving end of those -- I may not remember that one in particular, but I do recall others from other relatives/family friends doing it to me and YUCK!!!! YUCK!!! EEEEWWWW!! OK, so Grandma's friend makes her horrible disgusting fuss over me, but she's still holding me, and what do I do? Here it comes... I ask her with a perfectly calm demeanor, \"Are you a man or a lady?\"  (when my dad told me this story he said I had this innocent cute voice and big wide eyes). She says, \"I'm a lady, honey, why?\" I ask, still calm (and still \"cute\" according to my father), \"Then how come you have a mustache?\" Grandma's friend blushed furiously and put me down immediately, I'm told she, my grandparents and my mother were totally shocked and horrified, but it took all in Dad's power to not bust out laughing.  Sooo, that's how I got started........ ~Lena. ",

Please remember: Pictures:  I do not even own a camera (never have!)), and I refuse to buy one now. Everyone who's seen me so far seems to think I look great in short hair but since I can't stand it, and I hated having my picture taken even when I LIKED the way I looked, well, there's just no way in hell I'll be letting anyone with a camera near me, much less spending MONEY for one. Books: I don't want to get into the publication scene at all, plain and simple. I have no intention of submitting any of my writing to any publisher in any way shape or form (and don't get any ideas: I don't want anyone else to think of doing it FOR me). The fact that I'm dying of breast cancer does not make me \"special\" or any of my shenanigans or memoirs any more salable than anyone else who can construct a complete sentence. When I tell you my stories in here, sweeties, consider it to be more like us -- a bunch of friends -- all just sitting around in one of our living rooms having coffee or drinks and chatting:  I'm just being entertaining in my twisted sort of way when I have the energy to do it. OK? Thanks. :-) Maybe I still need time to REALLY get used to it, but, while there IS a certain kind of relief in going out topless, the \"freedom\" of not having to bother with the wig is kind of cancelled out by the feelings of \"old and ugly,\" which I'm having a really hard time reconciling myself to being. Maybe in time I'll be able to accept it and not feel bad about it, much like anything else in life that's unpleasant (such as not being omniscient or infallible) but one \"just gets used to it.\" Well I'm a long way from being used to THIS and don't know if I'll EVER be able to make the full transition. Geri -- actually you're brave (or crazy LOL) to be doing what you're doing. I am, or should I say I WAS, a 34C (not sure what I am now: my left breast is normal, same size as before the cancer, but my right breast is shriveled/malformed from the cancer, and I don't wear a bra at all ever anymore), -- when I THOUGHT I was going to have a mastectomy, I ended up deciding against reconstruction when I saw all the \"extra\" surgery and recovery time it entailed, because I'm unwilling to endure pain for anything which is cosmetic only. Heck the only reason why I didn't demand \"TAKE THIS FRIGGIN TUMOR-BREAST OFF ME ANYWAY!\" when my oncologist said mastectomies only helped Stage IV patients when they had open sores/tumor breakouts was because I'm too much of a sissy to deal with pain, discomfort and disability unless it's forced on me (and even then, I whine) -- so if doc doesn't think I need it, I'll gladly skip it. Well -- you couldn't get reconstructed to be the size YOU wanted to be? Like if you think C is \"too big,\" couldn't you have said you wanted to be an A or a B? Well, I hope you're feeling better and better each day. How long till you're \"normal\"? ;-) Betsy -- how's the physical therapy going, and how are you feeling? Anybody else out there -- or are you all out enjoying the beautiful summery weather? Gosh, even I went out for a short walk around the block when I got home from today's injection/after lunch. Probably will catch you all tomorrow to let you know what happens at the oncologist's. Hopefully he''ll take me off the injections! Feel good, and don't do anything I wouldn't.... ~Lena. ",

WTF?! And that was my GOOD day, too. The rest of it, OMG do we even want to GO here? If I wasn't bordering on \"suicidal\" sad/crying my eyeballs out, I was murderously furious and slamming doors. Things that normally don't bother me, bothered me. Things that normally only bother me a little, bothered me a LOT. Things that normallybother me a LOT were totally and completely intolerable, and my reactions to even the legitimate stuff were way overmagnified -- hence the crying and doorslamming. I guess it's good I live alone -- no one to yell or throw things at, cause I'm sure I would have?  (uh-oh, here we go again. I can't even post without busting into tears...)

Still feel sad and oversensitive. but that uncontrollable 3 day \"firestorm\" of bust-into-tears and door slamming murderously angry hyperemotionalism coming on every five minutes seems to have passed. So you don't have to \"worry\" about me anymore, OK? Also, I am going to persist with this med for awhile (as in at least stay on it to give it a chance to kick in enough to lift the depression, which is 4-6 weeks). I have to give it a chance to work because Wellbutrin is the ONLY antidepressant which DOES NOT have ANY sexual side effects or make  patients gain weight (with any luck, it'll even HELP me with my diet: I was reading stuff about patients losing weight on it and being as happy about that as they were to not be depressed anymore). See, I FUCKING REFUSE TO TOTALLY LOSE MY SEXUALITY AGAIN *AND* I AM SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF THIS FAT SLOB SHIT! I'm SURE it's the goddamn fucking Aromasin which is making it so hard for me to lose weight (I KNOW it's also why I GOT this depressed and joint aches and feeling like I'm 80 years old and ready for my deathbed), and I would throw my Aromasin in the garbage can in a flat nanosecond if I wasn't Stage IV. Hell, I will probably go off it anyway (because the life I \"gained\" by undergoing treatment has NOT been worth living, and in fact it totally destroyed the remaining joy DID used to have!!!). But OK, first I'm going to give the Wellbutrin a chance. IF I can somehow stay on the Aromasin to delay progression of my cancer, AND also become a sentient life form again, okay, but if not, I'm done with this shit, I'll call a hospice to get my expiration date and Dr. Salerno can shove the AIs all up his anal sphincter! So before I go I feel obligated to say one thing, and it's actually to Helen: Helen, if you want to start feeling like a human being again, GET THE HELL OFF THE FRICKIN ARIMIDEX!!!!! You aren't Stage IV, you don't \"need\" it. Is it possible you recovered so well from your original episode of breast cancer because you weren't on one of those goddamned AIs? OK, gonna go for now. Thank you all {{{{{hugs}}}}} for putting up with me. ~Lena. ",

Titan -- To answer your questions about Wellbutrin --  yes my energy and \"drive\" to get things done came back, and as far as I know, it hasn't turned me into a zombie -- the chemo and aromasin already did THAT. I can think clearly for short bursts but I have to write everything down so I don't forget, and I'm scatterbrained (not as severe as the onion in the dirty coffee cup and running out of the apartment building after having left my keys in the entryway mailbox incidents while having chemo but that TYPE of scatterbrained); my focus, attention span and short term memory are still screwed up but I think it's more the fault of residual chemo brain and a side effect of the Aromasin (which, as you all know, is for me almost as bad as the chemo and yes memory issues are one of the recognized side effects of AIs/estrogen deprivation and back to this again, dopamine deficiency brought on by estrogen deprivation). But in any case, I AM sure the Wellbutrin has made a difference/has lifted the depression at least to a point (hopefully the increase in dosage will actually make me feel like Me again), even if I still have all the other SEs of Aromasin. But, I digress. I know there are other antidepressants besides Wellbutrin; it's just that Wellbutrin is the only one I'm willing to take because it's the only one that doesn't have sexual side effects. (more on that when we get to Pam here)...hahaha, I still don't have time to write that \"I'm NOT a fucking warrior!\" thread yet, but glad to know you'll be \"with me\" if/when I do. I'll probably put it in the Stage IV forum though..... Helen -- Oh, OK, so you just got your Wellbutrin dosage increased too? I don't notice any differences yet though. I wonder if it takes a few weeks for a dosage increase to take effect like it does to begin to feel the effects of the drug when you first start it....glad you had a happy holiday, and hope you're able to fix the hip pain!  :-O Judy -- wow, didn't know you were Jewish, sorry I didn't wish you a happy new year sooner, hope you'll take a belated one. Happy new year, and wow, yeah, sounds like you did overeat a bit.... um, regarding your comment about my \"frankness\" I can't help but ask: are you so accustomed to lies that you find it \"amazing\" when you encounter someone who tells the truth? :-| Mmmm, well maybe I shouldn't be surprised, our society seems built more and more on image over substance, marketing, advertising, game playing, manipulation, putting on shows and \"spin doctoring\" . . . . . .which kinda has to bring me to Amy here:  AMY! :-O This has GOT to be one of the most outrageous examples of \"spin doctoring\" I have seen since former President Bush decided he had to justify the war on Iraq to the American public by accusing Saddam Hussein of having weapons of mass destruction! Saying I'M \"leading us all\" with a \"huge courageous decision\" to move -- are you for real?!?!?!?  My decision to move was simply nothing more than an act of desperation to be closer to the love of my life for the little amount of semi tolerable time I have left (i.e. whatever I have walking-and-talking time prior to the onset of diapers and drool at which point I plan to off myself) before I die of metastatic breast cancer (a year and a half or so down, maybe 3 and a half or so more to go tops); and because I can no longer handle this all completely alone anymore! That's all it is! Desperation motivated by weakness and FEAR! Be real willya and cut the spin! Life is only PRECIOUS in my opinion if it can actually be LIVED FULLY. I have not been able to live really fully since 1993, and obviously it got a lot worse in 2009 with this illness, and unless my new doctors turn out to be miracle doctors who not only pay attention to me and take me seriously, but can make all these side effects go away, well let's just say my days are really numbered because I may end up deciding to go off the aromasin just to get my brain back and stop hurting so much if only for a last short blast.  Pam -- last year I was depressed on chemo and the psychiatrist started me on Lexapro,. Yes, it helped my depression fast -- I felt noticeably better after about a week on it, BUT it totally screwed me up (pun intended LOL) sexually (i.e., took forever to reach orgasm and when I did finally get there, it was \"blunted\"), so I stopped it. After finishing chemo the depression was either gone or sporadic (when something sad happened or I'd think about how it was going to take forever for my hair to grow back to where I LIKE it, I would feel depressed for a bit but it would pass) -- until this year when I was put on AIs and while I didn't have nausea or more hair loss or the nasty taste in my mouth, the cognitive deficits and depression which seemed to be healing at least a little came back and got almost as bad as chemo plus getting joint pain and neuropathy which I DIDN'T have during chemo...so I did more research on antidepressants, thinking if I could control the depression maybe I'd be able to tolerate the painful AI SEs better? and found out all the antidepressants except for Wellbutrin can have those same, and for me, completely intolerable sexual side effects after that, so if ultimately the Wellbutrin doesn't work for me and I have to go off it, I go off the Aromasin too, since THAT'S what made me this depressed and brain dead this year. And if I go off the Aromasin, so far as I know now, my cancer -- which the chemo reduced but did not eradicate --  will progress and kill me. But at least I'll get some last time to be Me again before the Ultimate Final Decline starts and I have to off myself. Well okay speaking of frickin brain dead  yup this is just as bad as chemo -- nice long expressive post took me almost 3 hours to write..........gotta go. Be as well as you can.... ~Lena. ",

That must be such a relief, huh? As for the dust, my eyesight is so shitty dust has to be practically knee deep before I notice it even....oh, and yeah, guess I WAS a handful sort of. Probably why my parents usually didn't seem to want to be bothered with me, cause if they had, maybe they'd have thought twice about letting me live. LOL Titan -- well OK then -- if you LIKE to \"baby\" your kids, different strokes for different folks I guess. It's just that in my POV it looks like you're being exploited/taken advantage of for your good nature. Y'know, I guess I really just ought to shut my mouth totally on this subject when any of you talk about your kids because I never went there and haven't the foggiest clue about childhood other than my own (and it's a real toss up on whether I'd wish my childhood or breast cancer on someone whose guts I really hated THAT much). So, I apologize, and from now on, no comments from me about anything to do with your kids. Helen -- LOL but I don't go to parties...or throw them...hope work is going OK for you and that you're feeling as well as you can both physically and emotionally. Geri -- OMG yes the damn AIs made me overemotional/depressed/crying all the time....that's why I have to take an antidepressant just to tolerate them. I think the depression from it is even worse than the joint pain, neuropathy and continuing hot flashes, because being on the antidepressant makes me (slightly) able to tolerate the rest of it even though I still have to complain about it just to blow off steam. Well, hope you're enjoying being so busy.... write when you have time and are in the mood to, don't worry if you're not. We'll wait. Amy -- glad you enjoyed your trip. :-) Judy -- At a couple of the other forums I'm on, sometimes members post up links to YouTube videos. After I got DSL I started popping them and watching, and after a few weeks or so, learned not to do it anymore because with rare exceptions, I found these videos everything ranging from stupid to boring to offensive to so depressing it ruined a rare GOOD mood. Looks like I'm going to have to extend my \"no more watching YouTubes from forums\" rule to here, too. I am upset easily enough and don't need to see stuff like this to make it worse.   And if YOU are having issues with feeling sad, why did you post something like this? Oh never mind, that's a rhetorical question, no need to actually answer it. Well, I hope you climb out of it.... OK...this is it, going into the last stretch before Moving Day (Sat Oct. 2), and now I'm a worse wreck than ever....Kym backed out last minute leaving us with nobody to help on the NJ end. We need someone to help my Pack Rat carry the furniture -- bed, dresser, dresser mirror, computer desk an file cabinet -- down all the stairs from this apartment so it can be put  on the truck -- she and her husband were going to come up and her husband and my Pack Rat would do the big bulky heavy stuff while me and Kym would do the lighter stuff (boxes to go in my car). BUT... 2 nights ago on the phone, IIMO she went totally irrational actually and doesn't make much sense.  She's \"insulted\" because we don't have the time or wherewithal to socialize over the moving weekend (and I can't afford to put them up in a motel) -- she wanted them (her, her hubby and their foster kid, a teenage girl) to follow us up to NH so they could \"see the new place\" and \"hang out\" like it was going to be a mini-vacation of sorts. Well truth of the matter is this: me and my Pack Rat were striving to have the truck and my car all loaded up in time to be able to get out of here at noon in hopes of an ETA in NH around 6-7 PM or so (if we're lucky: there's this stupid Big E thing going on in Springfield MA or thereabouts which will likely stick us in an awful traffic jam so who knows what time we'll actually get there?)..... and in any case, even if we DID get there 6-7 PM we're going to be exhausted, we'll just wanna go eat and go back to the Pack Rat nest to relax and SLEEP. I know I've told you about his nest, he has no place for house guests, no bed no extra room no nothing, just me on occasion and I sleep in his bed with him. The unpacking at the new apt is actually scheduled for Sunday Oct 3rd -- his cousins are going to meet us there and help, and we're all going to be busy as sin -- no time to do anything fun or show anyone around or do any entertaining. Well there was apparently no way to tell her this nicely and she got mad. Now here's the irrational part of it: She and her husband have serious financial problems of their own -- he got laid off again last week, she still works but is starting a new job with her company -- on the 4th of October. And NOW is the time for them to go on an impromptu \"vacation\" which they can't really afford, consisting of a 6-8 hour drive, sleeping in an expensive motel by themselves, and the only people they know in NH aren't going to be able to hang out with them, and then they got that 6-8 hour drive back to NJ which they HAVE to do Sunday so she can go to work on Monday?!  Huh? WTF? Like what IS this?! Oh well......but in the meantime I am still moving and need to get someone to help my Pack Rat carry my furniture down all those stairs. The guy who runs the boathouse at the park I go for my walks in has some strong young fellows working for him, so yesterday I asked him if any of them would be interested in making $100 for approximately 2 or 2 1/2 hours of work next Saturday morning. He found me one, introduced us (his name is Michael), and we agreed that he'll be here at 9 AM Saturday morning, he'll help my Pack Rat lug the stuff down the stairs, then I'll pay him $100 in cash. He seems a really nice kid, smart, willing to work, speaks English (a miracle around here) but it kinda bothers me he's got no phone. I gave him my phone number and asked him to call me to  confirm the day before. I just hope it works out and he calls/shows up on time (yeah I gave him my address too and said 9 AM Sat Oct 2). I keep telling myself, this time next week I'll be outta here and in NH.....but I'm STILL a nervous wreck. Well, catch you all next time.....be well and have fun.... ~Lena. ",

Go on it\u2019s OK, you can yell \u201cToldja so!\u201d).  And it\u2019s STILL all weird. Sometimes I find myself stopping what I\u2019m doing, looking around and thinking \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d, other times I stop and look around and find myself admiring the house as if it were SOMEBODY ELSE\u2019S.   My Sims hacking mentor told me once I get the living room done and can start back on my Star Trek marathons, \u201cit\u2019ll all \u2018snick\u2019 up\u201d and I\u2019ll feel like it\u2019s \u201chome\u201d here. My Pack Rat only just got the DVD/VCR mystery solved last week so I\u2019m finally ABLE to run those Trekathons again, only I haven\u2019t felt like running them yet -- just watched one episode of DS9 after dinner with my Pack Rat last Thursday night, but that\u2019s been it so far. Borrowed a couple movies from the library but they didn\u2019t help me feel \u201chome\u201d yet either, they were merely a pleasant distraction.   Medical is up and running now though, but I ran into some unexpected medical reboot complications (with regards to Medicare Part D, since I\u2019m on SS Disability). Please don\u2019t ask me to recount all the specifics. I\u2019ve ALWAYS had problems not being able to understand or remember very much about ANY kind of insurance details (anything legal or financial either for that matter) that I can\u2019t blame on cancer, chemo brain or aromatase inhibitors. I ran out of a couple meds because I couldn\u2019t afford to renew them out of pocket (got \u2018em now though). One of them was the Aromasin and I figured \u201cwell at least maybe I\u2019ll get a little time to feel better until this gets all straightened out.\u201d Problem is, I didn\u2019t get to feel better at all and was off it for 3 weeks too. :-( The stiffness and aching not only didn\u2019t go away, but got worse, and I also felt a bit depressed even though I only missed one day of Wellbutrin. Yes, I did get back on the meds I ran out of, and the Medicare \u201cspecial help\u201d subsidy also came through and I can actually afford the copays when I pick up drugs at the pharmacy.   On the upside of medical matters, however, the medical PERSONNEL seem to be a lot better and nicer here, although the sequence seemed a little weird. In order, I had appointments with:   1. Nurse Practitioner (personally, I think of them as \u201calmost-doctors\u201d so that\u2019s the term I\u2019ll use here) of my new PCP (who I didn\u2019t meet until TODAY). Well...had an appointment with him Nov 1st. He was very nice, and he actually listened to me, so I like him.   2. New oncologist (I like her better than my old one too) and,   3.  same day as the first oncologist visit, with regards to my deep vein thrombosis/being on Coumadin, I saw another almost-doctor (the PCP\u2019s almost-doctor had set me up for this when I saw him on Nov. 1st -- get this :-O they have a whole Coumadin DEPARTMENT with special program to manage patients\u2019 Coumadin dosages at this place!) I liked her, even though she said ::::shuddering to even think:::: the \u201cL-word\u201d (Lovenox), as in there\u2019s a chance they might want me to go back on those horrible injections. (I didn\u2019t run out of my Coumadin so kept taking it, but my INR was down that day (back in the \u201cgood\u201d as of 2 weeks ago after a dosage tweak, good today too).  But she actually said my condition is too complicated for her to decide what to do with me, that I should see a hematologist but that hasn\u2019t been set up yet and quite frankly I\u2019m not gonna push it because I do NOT want to be told I have to do those injections again. :-O   But anyway, back to my new oncologist. She not only listened to me, but she answered my questions straight-up. I actually asked her how long I\u2019d have and what I could expect if I were to stop the Aromasin. She says I\u2019d probably make it a couple more years okay before organ mets began to set in, after which point I would \u201cgo\u201dpretty quickly, though unpredictable. Well something to think about and finally got someone who\u2019d be straight with me. FINALLY! In the meanwhile, she ordered scans (PET/CT), for both the cancer we know about (i.e., was the Aromasin helping by either shrinking my tumor and bone met -- or is it simply keeping me stable), but also to see if the scan will show any reason why I\u2019m extra stiff and achy. AND -- she gave me the OK on getting my port out. I was about to schedule it but as it happened I\u2019m actually going to keep it a little longer, since THIS facility, unlike the old one, actually USES it for blood draws and scan contrast/radioisotope injections), just see if I think having it used is really worth keeping it or not. See, when I\u2019d told my Pack Rat I could get it out, he said \u201cJust because Trinitas didn\u2019t use it for those other things doesn\u2019t mean Dartmouth won\u2019t.\u201d So when the assistant from the surgeon\u2019s office called to schedule me, I told her about how even though it\u2019s a Power Port that CAN be used for blood draws and scan injections and other intravenous stuff besides chemo, Trinitas refused to use it, so since it was bothering me and was maintenance (needed flushing) and wasn\u2019t being used, I wanted it OUT, but if Dartmouth would use it, I\u2019d give it a try for awhile and we can always schedule surgery for another time. She said yes they use it (and they DO! I\u2019ve had two blood draws and my scan injection in my port so far) so I\u2019m thinking on if it\u2019s worth keeping it even though it does still bother me with bra strap, purse strap, computer bag strap and seat belts.   Scan results -- no visual condition to explain all the pain, but as to the tumor: REGRESSION -- to the point where she may want to re-biopsy my breast in a few months because she thinks the tumor MIGHT actually be DEAD. Nodes all clean and the bone met is practically GONE. (gosh, the cancer\u2019s going AWAY at least for awhile, huh? so why do I feel like physical crap all the time?! something just seems SO wrong with this picture!)...well anyway, new onc also put me back on Femara. She actually says MAYBE some of the pain will get better on Femara as compared to Aromasin. Now that I\u2019m on the Wellbutrin (which I wasn\u2019t when I was ORIGINALLY put on Femara), I figure maybe the Femara won\u2019t be as bad this time, certainly not worse than the frickin Aromasin anyway...   oh...and for the first time since this cancer nightmare started -- I get THREE MONTHS off from oncologist appointments -- next time I see her is 3/2/11! Too bad I can\u2019t get rid of ALL the medical visits till March...oh well..   4. PCP -- she\u2019s good too. Very thorough, and she has also seen breast cancer patients like me who have bad SEs from AIs and she seemed to be frustrated by those meds causing SEs.  Since the onc had said she didn\u2019t feel she knew enough (but a general internist and/or psychiatrist would) to even have an opinion about my AI/dopamine hypothesis. And then to my shocked suprise, my PCP\u2019s comments about breast cancer and AI treatment in general (i.e., how many women she\u2019s seen having problems with it even though it works well against cancer) kept coming closer and closer to that on her own, so I pitched it at her to see what she\u2019d say, mentioning how all the AI estrogen depletion SEs are all on the dopamine deficiency list as well, and how the Wellbutrin, with its dopaminergic mechanism, has made enough improvement that I\u2019m (still only barely, but at least barely) able to tolerate AIs. She totally understood it, said it made sense, and also thinks the AI estrogen deficiency effects other neurotransmitters also, but to get THAT far involved in it is in her opinion really a matter for a psychiatrist (so she set me up to see one next month), although she was qualified enough, she thought, to discuss Wellbutrin in conjunction with SSRIs. When I told her the Lexapro/unacceptable sexual side effects story, she said yes, she\u2019s aware of those SEs and understands completely why I won\u2019t put up with them.  But she also says for some patients (ones like me who consider their sexuality very important), Wellbutrin, which I\u2019m already on, helps that, and she suggested I think about the possibility of trying a smaller dosage of an SSRI than the 10 mg of Lexapro I had been on (say only 2.5 to 5 mg) alongside the Wellbutrin, that possibly this would lift the remaining depression and not cause the sexual side effects (and if it did, I\u2019d know it right away from prior experience and  could just stop taking it and the fact of having been on a smaller dose would mean the SE would go away quicker). So she says I can think about it on my own and if I decide I want to try it, call her at any time and she\u2019ll call it into my pharmacy, or if I feel like hanging on and discussing it with the psychiatrist, that\u2019s OK too. She also said, it\u2019s probably a shot in the dark, but the last medical possibility she can think of which would explain several of my symptoms, is thyroid malfunction, so she ordered a blood test for that and I have a 3 week followup with her for January..which will also coincide with having to get my INR test again...which leads to...she actually took it upon herself to explain the splenomegaly which has been turning up on my scans since the thrombosis issue. Due to the area of my blood clot (portal/splenic vein), blood flow from the spleen is being blocked and is accumulating in my spleen. She says thus far it\u2019s OK (I\u2019m asymptomatic: she was able to feel a part of my spleen but I have no abdominal pain at all) and it\u2019s good I\u2019m on the Coumadin.   I\u2019m going to hold off on the SSRI thing for now, just do some research on AI-SSRI-Wellbutrin cocktails, and also thyroid stuff just in case. Maybe if I have a thyroid problem which can be treated, I won\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d the SSRI, so I\u2019m going to wait for the results of THAT test at least.     Oh Amy, did you say you had family in NJ? I thought you\u2019d said they were in NY! My Pack Rat\u2019s family is still in NJ (Ocean  County) so he dragged us there for Thanksgiving...but he also got us a hotel room with a JACUZZI! I had never been in one of those before -- in my nefarious youth, I used to \u201cget wild\u201d in regular swimming pools, lakes and the ocean. Well wow, this sure put a whole new spin on \u201cgood clean fun\u201d and taking a bath! I hadn\u2019t taken a bath in decades; it\u2019s almost always been showers. He said he got the room with the jacuzzi because of how fondly I had spoken of my watery past (heh heh) and he figured this would be a good way to try that himself! LOL. If/when we do this again, I\u2019m going to buy bubble bath stuff.   And now...gotta go sweep the snow off the deck stairs and my car..... be back later...",

If you pop back -- glad to hear you're working again. You're apparently one of those people who seem to thrive on having too much to do! LOL On the subject of jobs: Titan (and Helen) -- it didn't take breast cancer for me to reach to the point of considering that \"a job is just a paycheck, nothing more, and if I didn't need the money, I'd be perfectly happy to stay home and not work at all.\" I had been feeling that way for several years, ever since I learned this lesson ten years ago: It doesn't matter what field one works in, what one does or how hardworking and good one is at doing it -- those who lack integrity and/or are willing to be politics-playing phonies are the only ones who are going to \"succeed.\" Betsy  -- you can put me down on that wretched \"hair is growing back slow\" list too.  :-( It only JUST got (as in I only noticed it as of last week) so the \"longest\" part JUST TOUCHES my neck. It's juuust about ALMOST to where that  transitional haircut I got a week or two before starting chemo --  when I had it cut from near waist length to bottom of the neck length; I didn't get the rest buzzed off until a week or so after my first treatment. Which means I still see a stranger when I look in the mirror. :-(  I'm now.. hmmmm...a year and five months PFC and have NOT cut my hair even once. NO trims for me, not any, ever! I mean why would I go and do something stupid like cut my hair when my ONLY complaint about it is that it's TOO F***ING SHORT?! My hair would have to grow two or three more FEET longer than it is now, MINIMUM, before I'd even CONSIDER a trim, and if I did, it would be only to even out the length on the bottom/get rid of split ends. Oh, and I can't multitask either. I wasn't all that great at it before chemo, so now it's practically impossible. Heck, I still have issues staying focused on a SINGLE task, and that, I DID used to be good at -- expert, in fact.  :-( Betsy, you actually described it perfectly when you said, \"I just wish the new me didn't feel like a dumbed-down version of the old me.\" Judy -- actually it's my Pack Rat who has the seasonal affective disorder you were referring to. True, I hate winter and the shorter daylight limits certain things for me, mainly anything that would necessitate driving after dark (so I have to be careful to schedule doctor appointments and run errands so I can be back in the house at 4 PM or earlier this time of year), but I've never had depression limited to wintertime -- hey I get it all the time! LOL Whereas the only time my Pack Rat gets depressed IS in the wintertime. But he says it got a lot better when he started taking Vitamin D supplements. He's still not cheerful or particularly ambitious, but he says the lethargy and lack of motivation part of it has significantly improved with the Vitamin D. I take Vitamin D also, started taking it since maybe a couple weeks after starting chemo, but I got horribly depressed anyway. Of course, my Pack Rat doesn't have cancer and hasn't had to take chemo or AIs either....oh well maybe you DO have to accept the size 12s instead of 10s unless you're willing to do tedious torture (i.e., STRICT dieting and/or STRICT exercising). It got too cold for me to keep up the daily walks but I'm still on the diet, which is fairly strict. I'll go for walks again when the weather warms up although by THAT time I'll probably be on maintenance, not weight-loss, when it comes to the diet. Still though, I am now down to just the ONE spare tire around the middle; my 2009 jeans not only fit but are EASY to put on and more COMFORTABLE than they were in 2009 too. Maybe I'll be able to get smaller jeans by summer. I hope. Geri -- glad you enjoyed your Thanksgiving trip to North Carolina -- and how was your onc appointment today? Helen -- I hate ANYTHING that involves sticking me with ANY kind of needles, PERIOD. (gosh what a heroin addict I would've made LOL).  THAT was why I agreed to get the port for chemo, and why I was so pissed off at my old cancer center not using my port for all the other needle stuff (the blood draws and scan injections) when I had the kind of port that they COULD use for that stuff. And my old cancer center was ALWAYS taking blood every time I went in: onc wouldn't even see me unless I'd gone to the vampire first. My new onc hasn't yet ordered blood tests for me; most of my blood testing so far has just been INR monitoring for Coumadin dosage (yesterday was the first time they took \"real\" blood, as in intravenous and fill up a vial; new PCP wanted to test for thyroid issues). Once the Coumadin folks got my blood from the port (the day I had the PET/CT scan) but the normal INR procedure HERE is \"new\" (new to ME, I mean). Here, they take blood for INR with finger pricks instead of from a vein in your arm). Learned real fast that I hate that too (it hurts not only at sticking time, but usually for hours after, and yesterday's resulted in a nasty bruise on that finger). So I'm going to see if I can arrange to have blood for the INR ALWAYS taken from the port too. IMO it would make sense: I'm required to have INRs once a month, and supposedly also the port should be flushed once a month too. If they don't want to get my INR blood from the port, then I'll be leaning more towards getting the port out. OK, how's the physical rehab and all going for you? Glad you enjoyed Harvard. I gotta look up exactly where Harvard/Boston is in relation to where I am, but NH does share a border with MA. I know I'm NORTH of Boston, but not how FAR north, or east or west. Gotta ask Google, for curiosity. Not that I plan to be driving in Boston, mind you, but I should still know where it IS..... OK gotta go eat dinner. Will try to finish the \"catchup\" later or tomorrow.... ",

I'm as OK as it's possible to be, that is, still out of calibration but no NEW pains to report (still got all the ones you know about though). Today I switched out the stuff in two of the overhead kitchen cabinets. Now what did I go and do THAT for? I was almost sorta kinda even if not quite really beginning to get used to having the dishes in the cabinet over the 'big' counter but it didn't \"feel right.\" I kept telling myself I'd get used to it with more time but I kind of lost patience with myself on it and I have no idea why, seeing how this kitchen is so totally screamingly different than the old one so there is no replicating the way I had things in the past. No matter where I put stuff, I'm going to HAVE TO adapt to the change. But I moved the dishes and drinking glasses to the cabinet over the smaller counter over where the dish drainer is anyway, and I'm not even sure it helped! (and to think the kitchen here is tied for #1 with \"devoted computer room\" on the \"best things about this house\" list, too!) Geri -- so glad to hear your liver test came out good. My thyroid test was good too (my thyroid is perfectly OK), so now I really and truly CAN point the finger at the AIs as the reason why I feel so lousy. Helen -- YES. I know EXACTLY what you mean when you say the Wellbutrin helps you cope but doesn't make you happy! That's what I feel too! And now that I know it's not from thyroid malfunction, I guess I really do have to actually consider what a miniscule dose of an SSRI in combination with the Wellbutrin would do, like would it really help me WITHOUT ruining my sexuality? Betsy -- yup yup yup you told me so. LOL. Got a question for you regarding the acupuncture -- are you impervious to pain from needle sticks? Sorry about your work buddy's run of bad health too. Judy -- hope you're surviving all that busy-busy-busy -- well that goes for all of you who work AND \"do\" holidays. I honestly don't know how any of you do it. I don't have the grind of a full time job and I don't have to deal with kids or holidays, and I'm STILL exhausted most of the time. :-( Oh and I finally found some hair salons in the area. Me and my Pack Rat were out on Saturday afternoon and I noticed two here in my town, and a couple more in the next town over. The kicker is this -- the ones here in my town are both within walking distance of my house, and, before it got too cold to go out for walks, I actually \\ walked past BOTH of them and never noticed either one! Well maybe after (a) I no longer have to spend almost all my non-food, non-rent money on heating oil and (b) I get my car inspectable, I'll pop in and see about getting my hair straightened somehow. It'll be end of springtime but it'll also be when I go back to taking walks again too. Titan -- hahaha, so you're a clean freak? LOL...maybe I'll regale you with some of my gross stories from my old apartment....or should I be thinking of hiring you to clean my new place for me?  OK...guess I'll be off for now... catchya next time.",

I moved the olive oil to another counter, and made the coffee pot and toaster oven trade places....maybe one day this place will start to make sense huh? LOL Oh and on that note, since I'm STILL not used to the electric stove -- if any of you have electric stoves instead of gas ranges, do you ever get unexplained water in/on them (in and around the burners), and how do you keep them clean on top without discombobulating them so the pots and pans end up uneven? I don't miss my old apartment, but if I had any, I'd gladly pay money to get my old gas range back even though it was old and filthy.  I had an electric stove once in one of my old apartments, but I don't recall having these issues with unexplained water and slightly discombobulated burners after cleaning the stovetop. Need to look up the term \"plateau\" when it comes to dieting. I'm down to 130 -- and holding there so at least I'm not GAINING -- but I'm not losing anymore either even though I'm continuing to stay on my diet. My weight hasn't even budged for pushing two weeks. Maybe I should be glad I not only got rid of all the post chemo weight I gained but weigh 5 pounds less than I did when I started chemo at 10 pounds more than I liked, but goddammit I still do NOT wanna see that last roll still around my middle anymore! GRRRRR. Bad enough I still have to deal with the short hair. I actually put my wig back on a couple nights ago just to try it on for a few minutes because \"I wanted to see myself look good for a change\" and I DID look good and I'm SO sorry I went \"topless\" so soon. I should have made myself put up with the heat and kept the wig on until my hair could get to a minimum of bottom of my shoulders. :-( I think my new \"gotta lose weight\" is now as much of a control issue as it is a vanity issue. I am sick of being out of control and helpless. I was not able to hook up the magic cable on my own -- after having taken two HOURS to get the external HD out of the enclosure and figure out how the magic cable had to be hooked up...I got it all hooked up except for the plug-in to the power supply!! Just that one thing to do and I can't do it! -- because of my lack of strength and motor coordination in my hands. GRRRRRRR! And now I don't know what the problem is with the new 16 GB flash drive which worked in all 3 of the computers I plan to use it with when I opened it up two days ago, but this morning when I wanted to use it, it won't frickin mount. I KNOW all my USB ports work, I just frickin tested them with the two known good flash drives. GRRRRRRRR! I know...I'm cranky and getting crankier. Yes, I still take my antidepressant each day. Maybe my cocktail does need some additional tweaking. I have an appointment with Dr. Min (PCP) on the 12th so I can talk to her about it soon if I want....but hell, who WOULDN'T be cranky when feeling both ugly and incompetent at the same time?!  ",

That said, I'm still glad to see you both posting. I suppose you're like me in the sense of coming on for several posts, then \"disappearing\" for awhile, then another spate of posts, back and forth...   Titan -- well as you know I'm not celebrating, but two years ago today I had recently been scheduled for and was waiting to have my surgical biopsy performed 1/31/09. But I \"knew\" it was cancer, so I didn't feel anxious/in a hurry to have it. In fact, back then I felt, the longer it took for me to have all the diagnostics necessary to get the actual objective medical confirmation of what I somehow \"knew,\" the longer I could go without making decisions or \"having to\" do anything about it. Note: in November *2008*, at my Pack Rat's behest, I went to NJ's breast and cervical cancer screening program to get initial exam; day of exam I was immediately sent for mammo and ultrasound, but after that there was a lot of bureaucratic red tape in a switchover from the original facilities in Hoboken/Jersey City to Trinitas in Elizabeth, where I lived, not to mention getting on Medicaid) and I ended up having to have repeat mammo and ultrasound at Trinitas, then they couldn't do the original planned core needle biopsy because my tumor was so big and dense the doc couldn't get the local anesthetic injection inside the breast even and she was poking around inside my breast with the damn needle for ten minutes and I was crying the pain was so bad, so that's how come I had to have a surgical biopsy under a general anesthetic. All that between weeks of red tape crap and a few train trips to Hoboken/Jersey City (I wouldn't drive there, too afraid) because they couldn't use a frickin mailbox or let me use one when we had to exchange documentation and films. But I didn't mind or freak out through any of the WAITING through scheduling delays for tests, results and finally the surgical biopsy. But anyway, that's where I was two years ago today -- still waiting to be biopsied -- and feeling a hell of a lot better than I do today! (Not to mention looking better too, since my hair was long!)...   Betsy -- if you're a lousy left hander (me too only worse I bet since not only am I strongly right handed, but it's my left hand which is partially paralyzed from the stroke!) -- how do you even PUT a lymphedema compression sleeve ON your right arm? I hope the physical therapy works for you too...and yes, the damn AI slowed my metabolism to a slug's pace too -- remember, I started dieting to lose that 30 pounds the last week of APRIL 2010, and now here it is JANUARY 2011 and I STILL have 4-5 pounds more to lose? And oh I'm so with you on having a disgusting muffin belly. Yes, mine is now smaller for having lost most of my excess weight, but I do still have it. YUCK... Gotta admit it though; since I was about 10 or so, I was ALWAYS thick through the middle (even when I weighed 115-120 pounds from my mid-teens to early 20s). I have always been, and am to this day, in spite of accelerated old age through chemo and AIs, slim everywhere EXCEPT my waist and belly...only AIs made it much worse! In the past I attributed my yucky middle to being under-exercised. That is still part of it, I'm sure -- just walking, even a couple of miles every day, is neither enough, nor is it waist-and-abs specific, and now that it's too cold to go for walks, I'm not even doing that until spring -- I\u2019ve been dieting but not exercising since mid-November when it got consistently too cold out for me. Was talking to my doctor today (more later) though, and I have a plan even though I can't afford the gym (I found out the local gym has a very descriptive website detailing all their exercise equipment, trainers, types of memberships and so on). Hmmm waitaminnit: does all the recent snow shoveling and sweeping snow off the deck count as exercise?  :-P      Judy -- There's Internet in Israel, I know there is! Just because you move back there doesn't mean you have to leave us. How's your diet going? How about your moods and stress?     Amy -- That\u2019s terrific you enjoyed your vacation so much. But you have to tell me: what was the weather like in Death Valley? HOW warm was it? Yes it's now frigid here in NH, that's why I wanna know how warm it was in Death Valley, since it's reputed to be the hottest part of the USA. Oh and one more thing, what is a zipline?      Helen -- How are you doing? Are you nurturing yourself better to help alleviate the stress and depression?   My Pack Rat brought the rest of my living room bookshelf over on his most recent visit, so in addition to our decadence (wine, food, Star Trek and total molestation) on Friday night through midday Saturday (food and more total molestation), he reassembled it. Being \"too tired\" when he left on Sat afternoon, I was lazy, but I spent all day Sunday unpacking the last of the unpacked boxes here and mostly filling/organizing the living room bookshelf. Now it looks like a living room, and there's room for me to unpack the rest of the boxes still in my Pack Rat's nest, when he brings them. I put some more of my decorations up; not done since the significant ones are mostly still in those boxes in my Pack Rat's nest (and I need to get those up and out before I let loose the Rats in Box 17), but some.     Dunno when to invite him next, what with MORE snow coming. NH is now full in the swing of the winter weather which had put me off to moving up here all those years.  But the funny thing is this...somehow I feel more \u201cin control\u201d of it here than I did in NJ...maybe it\u2019s because here, I have my own parking space? Or is it that the \u201clittle store\u201d here is closer to my house than the \u201clittle store\u201d I used to go to in NJ? Or both?     Boy is the doctor situation REALLY good now. I'd even say it was almost worth the earlier rebooting chaos. My appointment with Dr. Min and the Coumadin clinic was last week but on account of the major snowstorm for that day, I was EASILY able to reschedule -- so I went today, and oh, not only did Dr. Min answer all my Qs and we began to address AI SE-control issues, she told me she and her husband were Trekkies! Oh wow, COOL! Anyhoo, results of the medical visit:   1. In the search for OTHER (non-AI) possible medical causes or contributors to at least some of my pain and depression, seeing how my thyroid function was totally normal, I asked about bursitis and tendonitis, and she examined me for both.   A. Turns out I have both bursitis and tendonitis in my left shoulder and arm, and tendonitis in my right arm. She says alternate ice and heat on the left shoulder (so when my next disability check comes in a couple weeks, I'll buy a heating pad), and ice on the arm (since I don't use ice for anything as a rule, I have to make ice for this: doing ice cube trays tonight so I can start on the right arm tomorrow at least), plus a prescription for Tramadol to control pain from both that and pain we do know is from AIs (the knee joints) and cancer (my left hip, which some, but not all, of the overenthusiastic New Year's pain went away: she said yes, hip pain is possible on \"overdoing\" sex but also, even when mets are inactive, there's still damage from them, and given that my hip pain is ONLY on my left hip, where my met is, it's probably that too, and I should expect to occasionally have pain there even if the met continues to be inactive. But I can take the Tramadol for that too.   B. I'm also going to try a VERY SMALL (2.5 mg/day) dose of Lexapro on top of my Wellbutrin and see if that lifts the depression without causing the sexual SE's.  My original dose when I first tried it was 10 mg/day (and I didn't have the Wellbutrin). So, she prescribed me the 5 mg pills (smallest they make) and said take half of those for 1-2 weeks; if I notice a difference to the better, stay with that dose; if not, try taking the whole pill each day and I can go off it if I have the sexual SEs, PLUS -- Dr. Min says it's good timing for me to try the low-dose Lexapro now since I'll be starting to see my new psychiatrist next month (Feb 15th), and SHE can pick up my depression treatment from there by monitoring/keeping me on Lexapro if it works with no SEs, or trying another drug if it doesn't. And Dr. Min speaks very highly of the psychiatrist I'll be going to (Dr. Finn).   2. I asked about exercise, as in what kinds in addition to walking were possible and safe given all my aches and pains, and not being in the best of health or fitness. Mainly I wanted to know if various kinds of leg lifts and crunches would be as effective done lying on my bed (which I can do) as they would be lying on the floor (which is REALLY difficult for me, it hurts too much both lying down and getting back up) -- she says yes and just start easy, only a few a day at first and work up to more. So I'm going to see if I can trim my Midsection from Hell, slowly but surely. Since I lost enough poundage so that now I get the muffin belly ONLY when I sit down (flabby gut spillover) and am still working on losing those few more pounds, maybe the exercising of that area will help me get rid of the rest of it...    3. It's settled -- I am automatically scheduled to get ALL blood draws and other intravenous stuff from my port now, so today I had blood taken for my INR and got the thing flushed.    4A. Shock of all shocks -- Dr. Min called the Tramadol and Lexapro prescriptions into my pharmacy (where I stopped on the way home), and when I got there, they were READY, and I only had to pay $8.50 for them!    B. When I got back home, there was a message on my answering machine from one of the nurses at the Coumadin clinic -- with my INR result for today (2.6, which is good), and also the important information that both Tramadol and Lexapro can potentiate warfarin, so effective immediately they were tweaking my Coumadin dosage lower to try to accomodate (ah well, gotta go for another  PT/INR test on Friday to see how well this new dosage works). She left detailed information on the new dosage regimen too so I was able to \"fix\" my weekly pill container and I started the new dosage tonight.   Wow.    Also -- seems my seriously reduced ability to Sims-hack since chemo and AIs killed the best part of my brain has led to my being supplanted by a new up-and-comer. I should be happy, seeing how I had been the one who got her out of almost all of her beginner-hacker dilemmas by answering most of her techie questions at one of our forums, and I am sort of, but not entirely. Seems I'm still OK to give advice, but not so good at forging ahead with my own projects -- I now lack the focus and the sharpness and the \u201csparks\u201d...one of which SHE finished, even though she had no idea I had started it. She just made something I had started to make just before chemo and had it ALMOST done, but I couldn't work on it during chemo and eventually I had actually forgotten about it (thanks chemo! thanks AIs! -- NOT!!) until a couple days ago when someone posted how she wanted one of these.  I mentioned my WIP of this object and said I'd revisit it since \"I'm pretty close to finished with it: got 28 of the 30 foods to work...\" -- and a few hours later, \"S\" posted she had one all done!   :::::sigh:::::    Snow tomorrow...... ",

Congratulations on your weight loss, that's excellent! You too, Judy!  I'm almost \"done\" with my diet -- am down to 127 pounds. Probably blew it tonight with that meat loaf I made (but maybe exercised some of it off with my Pack Rat?)... LOL Amy that's great your mammogram and surgeon appointment went so well (and you don't have to go back for a good long while!)  Judy -- you too! I have an oncologist appointment coming up on Wednesday (3/2). Hiya Helen -- don't worry, there's nothing wrong with being a hermit! And yeah I hear you, things will never be the same again!  :-(  Geri -- hope you're enjoying life! (That's kind of something I need to work on, personally.) I don't worry about making sure I get mammos or any other kind of cancer screening tests -- not only will the quarterly PET/CT will pick up any new cancers or mets if I develop them, but honestly I don't really WANT to know if I get new cancer or new mets! OK, so....it's confirmed. No SSRIs for me -- even the tiny (2.5 mg) dose of Lexapro gave me the sexual side effects within two weeks, so I stopped and am done with that. Saw the psychiatrist and after she calls me back (she wanted to talk to my PCP and oncologist)..depending on that conversation, she'll probably have me try Ritalin in an attempt to clear up the cognitive deficits at least (if I could get my brain back, that would go a LONG way in improving my outlook on life!). My Coumadin dosage has been repeatedly tweaked in the last 6 weeks, finally think we hit on a good dose, and yeah, I think I'm gonna go for the \"deportation\" after all -- will discuss that with the oncologist on Wednesday. If she still wants to re-biopsy Cancer Breast to see if it's dead, I'm going to suggest surgery for both deportation and biopsy together. And did I tell you -- I've had enough snow already? :-P  OK, sleepy now (but my Pack Rat is totally unconscious hehehe).....feel as good as you can! ",

While waiting for him to get here I had time to wash the three-day accumulation of dishes in the sink, take a shower and actually fired up my Sims for a bit. Then he got here, we went out to the Salt Hill Pub. Yummm, even though I blew my diet out the window. I had an apricot sour (my favorite mixed drink), then ate cheesesteak with fried peppers, mushrooms and onions, french fries and onion rings we split and then pumpkin cake with coffee for dessert!  Naturally we had to do a lot of \"exercise\" ;-) to work all that off...he had some kind of spicy ham dish and I forgot what else was in it but like my selection, his was also one of those yummy things you eat when you're NOT on a diet or have only once in awhile as a treat if you're happy with your weight and want to keep it where it is. Yesterday morning sucked though -- I had to be at Dartmouth at *7:30 AM* for the CT/PET scan (they do both together here, not separately like at my last treatment center), which meant we had to get up at 6 AM, get dressed and get out since not only was the appointment early (I won't be doing THAT again; 9 AM at the absolute earliest from now on) but I couldn't have my morning coffee either (no eating or drinking after midnight the night before a PET scan). So we got out at 6:15 AM (too dark, almost at my \"too dangerous\" threshold--first time I drove in that much dark in years)! Another reason why I won't agree to a 7:30 appointment again unless someone ELSE is driving! Yeah right. Anyway, after scan I was scheduled for a blood test my oncologist wanted me to have, and then an appointment with my PCP. So I mentioned to my Pack Rat just before we went our ways, if the doctor appointment means I need to get more medication, well the Rite Aid is on the way to where he lives, and he says, \"Yeah, that'll be around lunch time. We can have lunch at the General Store.\" So OK, we go. Got to Dartmouth on time though, but I knew it really wasn't going to be a good day, planned lunch with my Pack Rat notwithstanding. A \"good day\" IMO does NOT begin with a 30-45 minute drive, early in the morning, without coffee -- and shortly after arrival, be stuck with needles and injected with something radioactive.   :-P OK. Scan goes smoothly, as soon as I'm out of there I get my butt to the cafe because I NEED COFFEE!!! (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center is a ginormous complex which is more than \"just\" a teaching hospital and cancer treatment center). After coffee I go to the oncology area to get my blood taken, and then onto the \"general medicine\" area to see my PCP. I was way early for HER, but I had my iBook and Sims. Finally got back interested in playing them again. A couple of simdays go by, then I see the doctor. Told her that the icing and heating my shoulder had helped, but not entirely (it doesn't hurt constantly anymore, but range of motion, certain movements are still very painful), and that the Tramadol wasn't as good a painkiller as the Darvocet had been. Also we talked about the Ritalin and recent moodiness even though I think the Ritalin actually IS helping me focus a LITTLE bit better. And........I told her about \"It\" -- the new lump -- even though I had the scan and am seeing the oncologist next week. She examined me and measured It. It's 2.5\" x 2\" and she says MAYBE it could be a cyst, and like I mentioned, see if it lights up on the scan, and maybe it won't. But if it does, well my timing was certainly good to find out, what with the scans and appointments with both my doctors coming up.  But then she said she was going to tell my oncologist about it as a \"heads up\" regarding the upcoming scan results. I couldn't help but be amazed; in addition to doctor-who-actually-listens, there's \"inter-doctor communications\" here. Like the psychiatrist had reminded my PCP to follow up with me about the Ritalin. When I mentioned how different this was from just about all the medical care I'd ever had (especially at my last treatment center) she said NOBODY should be treated like I'd been. So end result of PCP appointment; both my Tramadol and Ritalin dosage are slightly increased, and in addition to sending the heads up to my oncologist about checking the scan about that lump, she also says she's going to look at the scans too with regards to the shoulder, and depending on what she sees/my pain situation, she might send me to an orthopedist. And we also agreed it was a good thing my \"other\" shrink stuff is coming up (turns out the psychiatrist I recently saw was really just screening/intake and then refers you to the psychiatrist you're going to deal with regularly concerning meds and/or any possible psychotherapy). So I have appointments in April for a \"regular\" psychiatrist who will take over for medications and a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy. (I think the therapist is actually first though, but it's on my calendar.) OK, now I can go home, and as soon as I pull out of the parking garage -- it's straight into a freakin' BLIZZARD!!! :-O First day of spring, my ASS! I had a white-knuckled bug-eyed drive back (I HATE when I can't see the lines on the road, scares the crap out of me!), and was debating if I really wanted to do another 40 mins of that for a round trip for lunch at the Lempster general store. When I got to Rite Aid, I called my Pack Rat and he laughed and said, \"I knew you were going to call, I was wondering if you were still going to want to come out here\" and I told him how the drive back from Dartmouth had been and asked if it was any better in Lempster, and he said no, it's the same, so \"Get your medicine, buy some milk, go home and be safe -- we'll reschedule lunch for when it's NOT snowing.\" LOL Anyway, the \"biochemical firestorm\" is over for now. I think Sunday night with my Pack Rat helped as much or more than the doctor visit, though.  When I told him what the PCP said about the lump, he was actually optimistic thinking maybe it's just a cyst. We'll see though.  Errr. OK. Guess I'll eat breakfast and go get the snow off the car and deck........ ",

The PET scan showed nothing on the left breast about a cancerously active lump (the new one), but she says PET isn't the best test for that; instead I should have it mammo'ed and ultrasounded, and she says she'll set that up for me tomorrow.  ::::sigh::::: OUCH I hate mammos, but.... OK, guess I gotta have it. :-(     2. PET showed activity in my known cancerous right breast, and she's going to want to talk more in detail about what was, at our last appointment, a brief mention; saying she'd want to talk more next time depending on results of my next scan (which, now, is the one I just had: the M-word (mastectomy).     Alright, I know at LEAST two of you are totally boobless, so if any of you had a BMX with NO RECONSTRUCTION, I would greatly appreciate it if you would post your experience with the surgery, and especially, the recovery in terms of both pain and how long it took you to be able to do what you normally do in terms of light housework, grocery shopping, driving and so on (or direct me to where you might have already posted about it). I have been intermittently looking for this kind of info in the surgery areas of BCO but can only find women who had it with reconstruction, and I know that complicates things -- which is why, if I have a BMX (if the \"new one\" does turn out to be malignant, this is a definite possibility; and maybe even if it isn't), I will not be doing recon (dunno if I'll go flat or pad my bra when I go out, but I'm not doing any surgery that isn't medically necessary). Ehhh, hell, I'll just open a thread in that area and ask my specific question there. Sorry to bug you all.     Wow Geri, you're sure doing a lot of traveling lately! And all to warm places too...Florida? Puerto Rico?  I guess you just have to get away from our frigid Northeastern winters, huh? (I am SOOOOOOOOO ready for the spring which we're apparently NOT going to get!) .... and hey you have a boyfriend, don't you get in the mood with HIM? I mean that's mostly how I get in the mood these days, WITH my Pack Rat. Treatment killed almost all of my former spontaneous constant libido so now it's rare for me to get in the mood on frequent random occasions the way I used to; now I NEED my Pack Rat to go into heat! (I am just as sick and tired of being damaged goods/feeling like I'm 90 years old as I am of winter!)     Helen -- you've mentioned that even though you used to love your job, it became a source of stress for you since treatment (THIS time, not your first BC). If leaving it will reduce the stress, it WILL be a good thing. Too much stress makes depression even worse, and that\u2019s all you need -- NOT --!  Heck, just the THOUGHT of a full time job (which would also probably require multitasking, at least to a point) stresses the daylights out of me. I really wish I could give you a full thick head of hair, (noncancerous) boobs, or slim you down the way you'd like.... :-(  (Hell if I could do that, I\u2019d have MY former healthy matched set of 34Cs back and my hair almost down to my waist again too!)     Gotta go find out if my Pack Rat fixed his car yet and if not, I'll have to go get him. He said he'd come with me to the oncologist tomorrow. I told him I could use the emotional indulgence of him coming with me, and also finally he CAN -- I told you he works from home for 3 weeks, then goes to CT for a week to work in the office right? Well so far all my oncologist appointments ended up during the weeks he was in CT, until THIS one.     (See, I'm not so sure I can even be presented with or discuss any more MAJOR treatment ideas without the \"immoral support\"... LOL ... I feel like I'm falling apart and way past my limit when it comes to dealing with this by myself. :-( )   :::::sigh:::::     Hope you're all doing OK. I'll be back when I know more....           ",

The Ritalin has really been helping me focus what's left of my marbles. I had made a \"matter-disintegrator\" toilet and the sonic shower's all set to go (I wrote down the procedure) but immediately had to put it on hold....because out of the blue (from my POV), Raeven built a Sims hacking forum (The Drawing Board@Woobsha) and made me an administrator in it, and in posting something over there, namely how the matter disintegrator toilet and ready to rewire sonic shower were making me want to build my ta'Valsh installation -- which I cannot do until I finish the food replicator.... ....which I started in the fall of 2008 and had to put off when I hit Phase 2 due to my then catastrophic ignorance of what was really involved in a project of this complexity. I was coming up wanting to try again early spring 2009 just shortly before chemo (since I was at least back to doing custom food hacks), but chemo brain put ALL my Sims hacking (and everything else that necessitated an attention span greater than a mosquito's) on hold \"indefinitely.\" I made a couple of really simple things from summer 2010 through March 2011 and at least LOOKED at the replicator, but it's only now that I've osmosed enough corrections to the catastrophic ignorance AND can concentrate/focus well enough to give it the time it needs. But for right now, my programming tool has had enough bouts of instability that even with the Ativan I took, I'm still kind of pissed at it and need a break. So here I am... Chelev -- yup, glad to hear your oncologist appt went so well. :-) Geri -- ANOTHER vacation to a warm place? Well glad you enjoyed it. It's still vacillating from raw rainy-drizzly nasty cold and/or windy 40s to 50s which would be nice if it wasn't so freakin windy. There's been only one day in the past month I'd truly call Springlike so far, last Monday. Started out 40s windy rainy nasty but the afternoon blossomed out to 60, partly sunny and lightly breezy. So tell me, when it gets hot and chokingly humid, you'll probably want to visit NH (or Alaska LOL) -- right?  Yeah Amy, isn't it nice to have an onc you can deal with? About the sleep thing -- seeing how (naturally) totally crappy and grumpy I felt when I had the sleep issues, I don't care anymore that I have to take meds to sleep -- as long as I CAN sleep all the way through the night (minimum 6-7 hours) without interruption, I'm satisfied. Betsy, yup, mostly in a holding pattern at the moment*. Question for you though, since you seem to be our lymphedema queen; did you just have a sentinel node dissection or all your nodes removed? And I'm so sorry about your mother. That must be so awful for you.  Helen, how are you feeling now that you're retired? Without the pressure of keeping up with a full time job, do you feel that your general level of stress is easing up any? I've noticed that stress makes depression worse, personally.  And yeah, spring is still mostly avoiding northern New England, too. :-( Judy, are you feeling any better or are you still on the emotional rollercoaster?  Titan... yeah I'm going through the boobs or no boobs thing again. Either my Pack Rat really and truly doesn't care if I get reconstruction or not, or he's so good at hiding negative feelings for if I should decide \"no recon\" I can't tell how he really feels. He has always said it's up to me, as it's MY body; if I don't want to feel any more physical pain than what's medically necessary he says it's fine with him if I go all flat all the time or flat at home plus wearing breast forms when I go out. So then I got on the \"Since no matter what I'm going to lose sexual feeling in my chest, maybe I should at least LOOK nice so as not to lose BOTH feeling/function AND appearance\" train of thought, after the debate: I can go flat (no recon/extra pain) and get a mastectomy bra with pockets and wear breast forms so I'll look nice when I go out -- but how I'm going to look so \"hot\" while dressed (between the prosthetic boobs and my slimmer body) that I'll feel like such a fool when I take my clothes OFF and have nothing \"upstairs\" (not to mention forever embarrassed at the mere idea of doing a striptease for my Pack Rat which I haven't done in ages because of the mangled breast). If I get the recon, though, I'll look \"hot\" with or without clothes (er, well, as \"hot\" as possible for the ugggh 50-year-old lab rat with reconstructed breasts that I'll probably be if/when this comes to pass). And then I started back on my recon research, and talking with my Pack Rat, who still thinks I should have had a mastectomy back when I finished my chemo. And when I just mentioned this \"feeling fake\" with prostheses, he said recon is totally up to me, and I quote \"If YOU think it would really make you feel better about yourself, it's probably worth doing even though it's not medically necessary and will be more of a pain in the ass than just mastectomy.\"And, he added a suggestion: IF I decide to do recon, he thinks I should have immediate recon with saline implant (neither one of is comfortable with the idea of possibly having silicone getting loose in my body via a ruptured implant).  So I read Geri's post here where she says it was worth it to her to be uncomfortable for a week but be able to look good. And then I also read stuff elsewhere at BCO (plus a PM from one of my Stage IV IBC sisters who had BMX with recon and is glad she did, although it sounded like her recovery was a little more difficult than Geri's -- way more than a week and how I'd \"better\" have someone stay with me the first week).... And reading about hard ones, and easy ones, and hard ones, and easy ones, so many here at BCO I can't decide on my own. SOOOOOOO: I'm going into the holding pattern on the recon issue until I meet a BREAST SURGEON who will be more likely to estimate how MY body will react to all this.  So what else.... I have been, and am still so damn busy. Last week -- Spring Cleaning, did I mention it? The only time in my entire life I could truthfully say \"My house is spotless.\" LOLOLOL  And, #2 appointment with new psychotherapist plus PCP appointment regardin my shoulder. She ended up referring me to an orthopedist. Got permission from the landlady to paint the upstairs porch -- any color scheme I want. Yes, my Pack Rat will help.  I want yellow and white on the walls, and on the floor (hopefully) the shade of brown that matches the bedroom floor (since the bedroom leads out from the porch. Don't know when we'll do that, or, the shopping for the containers and dirt (I had wanted to try container gardening on the deck). It's hard to make physically active plans like that on the heels of major surgery (recon or not, IMNSHO having my chest removed constitutes major surgery), and also I'm wondering if spring is coming so late this year I won't have time to grow anything. Then to kick off the end of last week: back into Sims hacking, Raeven's new forum, discovered new \"little\" market which sells great fresh fruits and veggies, and a few days off from doctor appts.....ah and last week's Hump Day and Sunday afternoon/evening decadence. Laundry on Monday, with some Sims hacking. All day at Dartmouth yesterday.... had PT/INR test (temporarily stopped Coumadin in preparation for biopsies) with port flush, then the new medical psychiatrist who's taking over my antidepressant and Ritalin prescription (and she gave me another prescription for Ativan too). Next: saw the orthopedist, who asked me a few questions about my shoulder pain and had me do a few movements with my arms and shoulder to see how extensive it was. She acknowledged it and gave me a cortisone shot, saying it might take a couple days to take effect, and let her know if there's problems.  Then home and back to more Sims hacking. Except for Sims hacking, today I'm deliberately being decadent and lazy because tomorrow morning is biopsies at 9 AM and I'm scared to death since I stupidly decided to give THIS doctor \"a chance\" to demonstrate how it's OK to be awake since he can do it without it being painful. Uh-HUH, well we'll see.  When my Pack Rat comes over tonight I'll have to tell him I need 'extra' stress relief. ;-) Seven weeks to go before I HAVE TO have me and Shuttlecraft  T'Kiri \"Totally New Hampshirized.\" Meaning: I actually exchange my NJ driver license for a NH one, register T'Kiri in NH so I can get NH plates, then get my Pack Rat to fix T'Kiri's smashed right fender/put in new headlight assembly so she'll pass inspection, which has to be on my birthday. Or whatever order to do it in. And speaking of T'Kiri, she has her 6 months oil change/maintenance coming up this Friday morning. Hehehe, and since I use my Pack Rat's mechanic, I'll be in his town so maybe he'll come out and have a cup of coffee with me. So there's been my last two weeks and the rest of this one. Hope you're all doing OK. ",

Since I didn't enjoy clothes shopping before my mastectomy, I don't think I'll like it any better now, but it is what it is, I guess, and breasts or no breasts, I still need to have clothing that FITS and is comfortable to wear at the very least.  Maybe some of my former \"find clothes to hide my Midsection from Hell\" skills will be transferable...instead of hiding an oversized belly I'll now be hiding an undersized chest. Who knows. maybe it'll be easier to hide the undersized chest than the oversized belly...? Anyway, seeing how I'm \"stuck\" staying home until my drains can come out, I can peruse those \"no recon\" areas of the forum some more -- yeah, I've already done SOME reading over there.",

Visiting nurse came today between 12:30 and 1 PM and she said they could come out TODAY (provided I could get up to Dartmouth by 4 PM). Since I was under the influence of my most recent dose of pain medication, I had to get my Pack Rat to give me a ride (otherwise I'd have just gotten in my car and driven myself up there as soon as the nurse said goodbye). Wow, the wonders of being able to pull my pants down to pee and not worry about pulling the drains out! And she (the nurse who removed the drains) also took off all that horrible itchy steri-strips and tape too. I'm still sore, tired and need the \"professional\" pain pills (just took another dose, since the 11 AM dose wore off), but I AM much better without the drains and itchy-tape. Nap time, then SHOWER time!!! :-)",

Showering is possible, yes, and I went back to taking showers, but it's not \"normal\" yet either. I can't use my \"scrubby\"; I have to keep my body turned as much as possible away from the shower flow so it doesn't directly \"hit\" me in the chest, and I have to bend down to wash and condition my hair because I can't raise my arms up that high. But it's better than not being able to shower at all, and it's enough to keep the BO away (although I find I've had a lot less of that since my estrogen dried up)! I guess it'll just take some more time. But then again, it hasn't even been two weeks yet since I had surgery. I suppose given THAT, yeah I'm doing GREAT. But comfortable -- not there yet...PADDLE BOATING? I used to LOVE paddle boating. That, and my strong-water-pressure shower, are the only things I \"miss\" from where I used to live; the park where I used to go for my walks was just about immediately next door to my apt building, and it had a lake with paddle boating. I suppose there's places to paddle-boat here but haven't found 'em yet.    Amy -- Glad you didn't have to \"do\" drains.  LOL  Helen -- has your weather improved any? Finally, finally FINALLY the weather totally \"broke\" this weekend -- it got sunny and WARM!! I planted most of my container garden this weekend (I'm deliberately waiting another couple weeks to plant the cherry tomatoes). Other than that I was mostly lazy. Saturday night me and my Pack Rat went out for pizza and watched Firefly. Today was still gorgeous so I walked to the pharmacy to renew my Wellbutrin prescription, and found 99-cents each red \"wooden roses\" which actually look pretty real. They'll do for Pasteurella's until the zinnias grow....IF the zinnias grow. I used to be great with house plants in my teens, but I never got to do any kind of outdoor plants or gardening at all until now. Oh and speaking of house plants, Solfegietto likes being outside in his own pot with dirt now. Tomorrow -- studded snow tires come off, so it'll be a Pack Rat day. He'll be over for lunch, after eating we go to the tire place, and then, oh wow, I thought he'd probably go back home to finish his workday but when he called this afternoon he said he'd rather just come back to my house and work here. What good timing, too -- I had no idea. The day before he works from here, I usually move \"everything\" over to the iBook so he can sit at my desk and use my big monitor; I take the iBook downstairs. Well as it happens, this morning I decided I wanted to be outside on the porch today so I did the iBook updating already. So all I have to do now is just stay out here on the porch! LOL...well, OK, I do think I want to straighten up a little in there, and I know I want to sweep up and straighten up on the porch too, not just sit here being lazy on the iBook. On that note, think I'll say \"catch you all next time\" and go downstairs to get the broom and dustpan.... ",

If Tamoxifen is still working for you and you're not developing serious problems, stay on it!  Even if you and your doctors \"got it all\" between your surgery, chemo and rads and you're taking whatever kind of hormonal treatment to PREVENT RECURRENCE, I can tell you this. It stands to reason that if Tamoxifen can keep a Stage IV patient with considerable tumor burden STABLE (me, for instance), it's probably reasonable to say it will likely keep a cancer-free patient with NED (you, for instance?) from recurring. I was on Tamoxifen for 5 months after I finished chemo, and it kept me stable. Not only did it keep me stable -- my tumors did not grow and my bone met became slightly less active, but I HAD NO PERCEPTIBLE SIDE EFFECTS from it. Alas, the key word was \"perceptible\" -- my oncologist found that goddamn deep vein thrombosis on one of my scans (which I had no idea about till he told me: it was totally asymptomatic and STILL is), and Tamoxifen DOES increase the likelihood of blood clots -- so that's why he took me off the Tamoxifen, started having me treated for the blood clot and gave me a prescription for Femara. And there I took that horrible turn onto the Aromatase Inhibitor Boulevard and got lost for a year. You're right, Michele, you do NOT want to be on AIs with those SEs! I had 'em too, I have tried ALL the AIs -- Femara, Aromasin and Arimidex, in that order, and THEY WERE ALL EQUALLY TERRIBLE. Yes, they kept me stable for a year (the Arimidex failed a few weeks before my spring 2011 scan though, hence the wakeup of my original tumor, a tumor in my other breast, and the little crop of skin mets), but between the chemo and AIs I lost two years of life which was WORTH living.  And yes indeed -- feeling like a cranky 80 year old instead of a cranky 48 year old -- I was 48 when I started Femara -- that's EXACTLY HOW I FELT!! -- on ALL the AIs! Ahhh, OK -- so if I try to have Afternoon Rads I won't be tired in the daytime? (Hmmm, maybe I won't need to take sleeping pills anymore either?) I think maybe I could live with that. Will also keep the skin moisturizer thing in mind.  I'm still waiting to be set up with the radiation oncologist, so I still don't know yet when my rads start or how much I'll have to have. I have the feeling now that Dr. R (surgeon) and Dr. C (oncologist) are probably conspiring together, plotting and scheming. I mean, now that the Lab Rat has somehow barely managed to survive being systematically poisoned for two years with toxic chemicals and hormone deprivation and subsequently dissected, let's see what radiation on top of all that will do? SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! Maybe it's time to bite the mad scientists, before it's time for the necropsy. LOL",

I didn't move most of the way across the planet, but moving out of a place I'd been living in for 25 years was definitely a big shake-up and I remember those last three days -- actually the entire last week, as being totally bizarre. At least you're still busy packing though, that'll take your mind off it. I did so much \"pre-moving\" so comparatively far in advance -- probably because I COULD -- moving  only 300 miles made it possible (oh, and only having to worry about my own stuff, since I don't have a husband or kids). But weird. I had gotten everything other than just enough to eat (plates, coffee pot that kind of thing) with all boxed up and ready to go, and was totally on my iBook since \"all packed\" meant the main computers were down too, a week or two in advance of the final moving day. I had almost nothing left to do for that week or two other than marinate in my own nerves feeling so anxious and jumpy I lost most of my appetite and constantly felt like my skin was crawling.  Earlier on when I'd been doing the packing and pre-moving, being so overwhelmingly busy consumed every last iota of my faculties -- it's like I didn't have a lot of time to freak out or melt down. So even if it's overwhelming chaos for you to get ready to leave up to the very end, believe me when I tell you that's probably a GOOD thing... ROFLMAO Amy on your father's \"hobo in Holland\" story! One of my Sims buddies is from the Netherlands, and so was Lisa, the Patron Saint of Rats...who died of cancer 10 years ago. Dunno what kind of cancer she had though. Hey I'm surprised your dad didn't decide to learn how to SWEAR in Dutch too! Hmmm, maybe Karin will teach me, in exchange for all the Akaren swear words..... Well, I had to leave the house today whether I liked it or not -- I had an appointment for physical therapy. Different therapist this time, though.\"My\" therapist, who I saw last week, didn't have anything open for this week but she originally wanted me to have two therapy sessions this week, so she had referred me to one of her colleagues who has also treated mastectomy patients). So I had therapy today...and this therapist's jaw literally dropped when I fulfilled her request to move in various ways and show her the exercises I'd been doing so she could assess me in comparison to the notes she had on me. She couldn't stop complimenting me on how \"amazing\" I was doing!  Um HUH?! I'm shocked that she was shocked! :-O So it turns out that even though some things still pull/stretch/hurt a bit, I have almost all my range of motion back and I'm actually borderline physically ready for rads NOW! So she did some massaging my chest area skin while I held my arms up in various ways she told me to, and she gave me two new exercises. I don't have to have two PT sessions this week after all, I should just do all my exercises each day (the ones I was already doing plus the new ones) and have only one more PT session, two days before the rads simulation.  And tonight is the Science Cafe, so I'm going out with my Pack Rat tonight. And yeah, bringing an \"overshirt\" for tonight since even though today was tank top shorts and sandals weather (80s and gorgeous), it does cool down at night more in NH than it does in NJ. On that note, I have to try to find some \"evening wear\" and an overshirt to go with it -- it's not fancy where we're going but I don't want to go in the black tank top and shorts I still have on from today. My exercise walk for today was around at the medical center, so I didn't feel so conspicuous. I parked my car way out in a far parking lot, walked to the building then once inside, all the way to the opposite side of the building to where the therapy area was; had my therapy, then walked back back through the building, all the way out to the parking lot. I think I got plenty of exercise today.  Oh last night I finished the last slice of my birthday cheesecake. Every slice was just as \"to die for\" as the first. Even better, my weight is happily holding in the 120 pounds area, and I still have a few chocolate rat cookies left too -- YUMMM. Probably enough to last maybe 3 more days I think (I can eat two, maybe three chocolate rat cookies per day till they're gone, now that the cheesecake is all eaten up). Laundry tomorrow! ",

Question: do you still feel purged of your BC experience? Updates -- (1) Yesterday's paracentesis was a success -- they did it just right! And yeah, I remembered to take the lorazepam! LOL Well much to my shocked and happy surprise, they remembered to use the lidocaine before setting up my IV and even waited a few mins to let the lidocaine take effect to get the IV into my arm, and then they sent some Fentanyl (this is a VERY strong painkiller) through the IV, which took full effect prior to starting the actual procedure.  The ONLY pain I had at ALL was the stick/burn of the lidocaine going in (but that was brief and well worth it because IVs hurt me like hell without a lidocaine prep). I did not feel them insert the draining needle or feel the fluid draining at all! If only EVERY invasive/painful but not usually general anesthesia strength procedure could go as well as this one did! I'm going to have to remember to tell all my doctors about this when I get a chance, so any time any of them ever has to order painful or invasive treatments for which general anesthesia is not normally used, they can have me set up like how it was for the paracentesis. Today my puncture site is a little achey but not bad. I definitely feel much better WITHOUT the ascites! They drained 5 liters of fluid (which looked like apple cider!). That's just a little over a GALLON! I had weighed myself yesterday morning before going for the procedure (I still weigh myself every morning even though I'm no longer weight loss dieting); scale said 128.2 pounds. Then the nurse suggested I'd find it interesting to weigh myself when I got home from the procedure, so I did. Scale said 119.4! WOW! I'm still wearing elastic-waist bottoms today; I tried on a pair of jeans and they fit again, but they hug a little too closely to the puncture site for now. So maybe in a few more days. But at least I can bend down and pick stuff up without the swollen abdomen getting in the way, showering is OK starting today, and I almost look presentable.  (2) Still having issues with Medicare and my \"gentle\" oral chemo. Supposedly this will be fixed on Monday or Tuesday when Dr. C is back at MY medical center to rewrite the prescription! (she practices at several facilities) Talk about stupid: Medicare Part D rejects the cyclophosphamide, then I find out on the Medicare website that Medicare Part B will cover it -- but they need a diagnosis code whatever the hell that is -- and they won't take this stupid diagnosis code added to the prescription from anybody but the doctor, not even one of the doctor's APRNs just adding it to what the doctor already wrote. So why in the hell can't the Medicare Part D folks and Part B folks resolve this kind of stupid ass crap between themselves instead of dropping it and forcing the patient to deal with it?

Seriously though -- the procedure itself went very well, just like the first one. They were generous with the lidocaine before setiting up the IV and added versed to the fentanyl also. I don't remember them doing that last time, but OK. Hey since we're all old fogeys here, I bet you all get it when I tell you that while I was on that stuff, the room was \"spinning\" (not really \"spinning\" but...) like a TV with an unstable vertical hold!

I'm not big as a house anymore, and I chomped down half a turkey and cheese sub for lunch and didn't feel hideously full until AFTER I finished eating it. Betsy, whining and complaining is GOOD. You NEED to let off steam every so often. You're invited to all my pity parties, so can't you invite me to yours? LOL {{{{{Betsy}}}}} And now I need to go pass out.

Post-procedure pain is a little worse than the first one, but I'm still glad I had it done because Percocet helps the pain, and NOTHING helped the discomfort of being \"12 months pregnant.\" Visiting nurse was here this afternoon and we drained ANOTHER 900 mL today, yes, after 5.1 liters yesterday! Anyhoo, to answer questions about the catheter and ostomy bags -- no I don't wear a bag all the time, I only attach one for drainage. When drainage is finished, the bag comes off until the next draining. If I would have had to wear a bag all the time -- UGGGGH!!!! EWWWWW GROSS!!! -- I'd have foregone the catheter and preferred to get \"12 months pregnant\" again and arranged for standing paracentesis appointments every 2 weeks for the hospital to drain me. Draining is actually fairly simple to do. The hard part is that each time I drain, I'll have to change the whole dressing (I don't have full fine motor control in two hands, remember?). I was able to do my own draining today (though was glad to have the nurse supervise to make sure) but she had to change the dressing -- I didn't dare. I watched and will at least try it probably when she comes back on Thursday but I don't feel confident I'll ever be able to really get it (although this was my second time watching: I watched the first one yesterday when we finished the procedure). I know it's weird that I should be able to set up my own draining but changing the dressing should be so complicated, but it is. It actually requires more dexterity than the draining.  :-P I really frickin totally hate my body, even though it's smaller now and, clothed, isn't so embarrassing as it was as recently as yesterday morning. Helen -- what did I miss that everyone here is wishing you a happy Thanksgiving? Is there a special Canadian Thanksgiving and I didn't know about it but everyone else did? Well, OK, then happy Thanksgiving.  Betsy -- I used to be Bug Lady (in the microbiology labs LOL) but I'd rather be a street bag lady than be bag lady from WEARING a bag all the time. EWWWWW.  I'm sorry but that just grosses the hell out of me, and you know that's a really hard thing to do! I see I'm going to have to come back here tomorrow to see how you're doing and how your appointments went. Geri -- the catheter was my oncologist's idea; SHE suggested it. I was reluctant when she first mentioned it because I'm afraid of an \"open wound\" and something sticking out of my body (same reason why I was originally afraid of the BMX drains, only now it was the catheter instead of bulbs). I agreed to try it yup, because of the comparative independence factor, but I'm not yet entirely comfortable with it. That's mostly because of the dressing changing business and making sure not only is the wound clean and dry but the catheter itself is all wrapped up and in plastic so I'll be able to shower and not somehow accidentally pull it out and cause ratness knows what kind of pain and infection). I'll really have to see how this goes. I never REALLY got comfortable with the BMX drains either -- thank goodness I only needed them for a week, since I was totally afraid to shower with them and didn't until they were removed. Now I'm still paranoid about showering with this stupid catheter, remembering also the damn nephrostomy tubes' \"DO NOT LET THE AREA GET WET!\" instructions. Yeah, it's all clean and dry and wrapped up at the moment, but I am so not happy and afraid of the shower. The nurse at the hospital yesterday told me to wait 24-48 hours after the procedure to shower (paracentesis without catheter, \"you can shower tomorrow\"), and it's fine by me to wait till tomorrow although I technically could have had a shower tonight. Blecccch. I bet Titan's temporarily gone missing because of wedding stuff...right?  Amy -- wow, what a story is RIGHT, concerning your daughter's wedding....wow, I don't know what to say! OK, nightey-night all....... ",

Hopefully you and your husband will be able to help her make her wishes known to the rest of her family (not to mention her doctor)! Y'know, she doesn't have to do the kinds of Killer Chemo which brought us all here together in 2009 -- much to my shocked surprise the oral chemo I take now actually IS pretty gentle! So if she's afraid of Killer Chemo (I was!) but wants some kind of treatment, maybe she could talk to her oncologist about the less harsh treatments. About your checkups and testing now -- ultrasounds aren't bad at all unless you're in pain from something and they have to position your body in a particular way to do it and it hurts, so I wouldn't worry about those, personally. The colonoscopy I have no experience with but at this point, like I CARE?! LOL Geri -- if I really were a \"good influence\" on you as Betsy suggests (such an idea made me laugh so hard I almost pissed my pants!), you wouldn't be planning expensive vacations like that. So, you two enjoy yourselves, but you get all the credit for the idea and having set it up. LOL Betsy --  That's OK, you don't have to understand sims (yes, they're a \"they\"). Nobody does until they've seen 'em for themselves, and not even all of those folks get 'em either. I just was rambling about them, is all. No, you didn't tell me you'd planted the blueberries yet, only that you had the beds. Well cool you got them planted. Mmmmmmmm blueberries. I'm still sticking mostly to salad veggies I think if I'm still around to plant in the spring, but the idea of trying another strain of canteloupe appeals, as does green beans or broccoli. Have you gotten your scan results yet? Helen -- hey, NH might actually be warm to YOU! I've heard some tales of Canadian winters which make New England's look pretty balmy almost. So if you're doing OK with your walking, you can wear one of my pairs of short-shorts! heheheheeheee!  Amy -- hope you're enjoying that hiking in Virginia. I most certainly hope your weather is nicer than ours. We've had grey, wet, windy and chilly mostly. Yuck! And now for a total surprise, it shocked the hell out of me. Yes I CAN have Medicare-paid home hospice without going off my chemo after all! (and they'll pay for the chemo and all my cancer meds too!) And y'know why? It's because I have that expiration date you were all so horrified about when I told you all I had gotten it a few weeks ago. I found this out yesterday morning -- a home hospice nurse called, explained briefly, and asked if I was available to meet in the afternoon. Lovely woman and we had a fun visit even in spite of all the paperwork -- I made us some tea while we did it and chatted it up pretty fast. Too bad she has to be my hospice nurse though -- I'd rather have her as a buddy. She lives about 5 minutes from my house and she's my match in the \"tell it like it is\" department -- including the \"salty\" expressions. And she knows geek humor when she sees it (namely how I decorate my house). LOL! But home hospice is going to be taking almost all of the bovine excrement concerning my medicines, Medicare, co-pays and the damn paperwork and prescription chasing off my hands! OMG! That sounds too good to be true. She's going to come over once a week and do the maintenance on the Awful Ascites Bag for me -- the weekly changing that is, and also says she'll call early on bag day to tell me to let me know it's time for me drug myself silly so the pain pills will be in full effect for when the bag is being changed (which thus far has been nothing short of bad bordering on excruciating). :::::faints::::: Well, gotta go and make some chicken and sweet potatoes; my Pack Rat's coming over for dinner tonight.

Yeah still have that, but now instead of feeling it from just getting up from the couch or desk chair,  I can actually walk across the apartment before it hits.

My thought was always, well, before having cancer/doing chemo, \"well, it's her choice if she wants her hair that short, but she'd look so much nicer if she'd grow her hair longer.\" Now though, if I saw that I'd be wondering if the poor woman was a survivor who'd done chemo and felt her hair couldn't grow back fast enough, but didn't want to do the wig/hat/scarf thing now that she had SOME of her real hair back! I mean it must happen, right? And... I dunno, don't dykes wear makeup too? I mean, if there are heterosexual women who DON'T wear makeup (me!), there must be dykes who DO, right? I've seen women with super short hair (which was also unstyled, uncurled, i.e., nothing \"feminine\" looking about it) but they wore makeup and/or jewelry. Just because it's not my style and short hair makes ME feel unfeminine doesn't mean women whose attitudes and chosen appearances are opposite to my preferences are dykes!

It's not horrible, and I've only had intermittent low grade fever (99.x) which breaks when I remember to take the Tylenol...but still! Sheeesh! Now where in hell could I have gotten it from? Given the incubation time, looks like I picked it up at the hospital when I was there for my PET scan last Tuesday. Well I guess I should be glad I managed not to catch a cold until AFTER being off chemo for a few weeks, huh? And sheeesh, all that lovely fresh orange juice I'd been drinking -- TONS of it! Listen girls, drinking lots of OJ doesn't do jack to keep you from catching colds or helping you get over them faster. OJ is good because it tastes good, it's refreshing to drink nice cold fruit juice on hot summer days, and in general drinking lots of fluids is a good thing...but orange juice good for colds? I don't think so. Kind of makes me think of how my grandmother used to tell me eating carrots  (which I did nonstop as a kid, and I still love 'em) was good for eyesight -- but I still ended up blind as a bat (it's been decades since I could see the \"Big E\" on an eye doctor's chart without my glasses/contacts/whatever corrective lens the doc is testing out on me).   Well OK, for once I ranted about something other than cancer or hair loss! LOL   Geri -- Sorry my long post tired you out so much. Since you're still on chemo, you're duly excused from having to read my posts -- just scroll on to someone who writes less! LOL! Glad you're feeling as OK as is possible for still doing chemo. You're definitely on a different regimen from what I had (6 rounds of TAC). I wish you as few side effects as possible.   Lesley -- that's great you finished your chemo 7/31 and your surgery was such a success -- I guess your tumor must've been pretty big if it was still 5 cm AFTER the chemo. I'm still waiting to find out how my originally 12 cm tumor fared.   Pam -- glad you enjoyed Maine and that you're climbing out of the chemo hole so fast. :-)   Stephanie -- it's wonderful to hear that you're also climbing out of the horror that is chemo. The combination of mouth sores going away and taste buds functioning properly again is excellent! And yeah, it always feels good to have energy coming back. Some of mine came back until I caught this darn cold.    Betsy -- were you blonde before chemo? Maybe that's why you can't tell what color your new hair is yet -- and if you were originally blonde, this could be a good thing. I'm still Mycelium Head -- I have sticking-up colorless fuzz on my head. Since my natural hair color (pre-chemo) was chestnut brown, I have no idea what's going to happen with my \"new hair\" once it grows some more...i.e. will it turn brown or grey?!   Linda -- Glad your scans came up clear. :-)   Like I said, I got some more energy back (enough to go for a WHOLE walk), and a little more of my chemo brain went away, I actually got that hacked Sims fridge started and made a test version. OK, so it failed the test, BUT -- that could have happened anyway (not all my creations work on the first take), and I was able to focus long enough to see it through from beginning to making something POSSIBLE to test. And, I know what my next approach will be.   Well, gotta go. My simmies need me now!    ~Lena.                ",

I mean, the total absolute blinding fog I'd been in while on chemo started to clear at about 4 weeks PFC but now I can actually think straight and I'm getting creative sparks again! Focus and memory are still not back 100% yet -- seems my cognitive function is returning in bits and pieces -- but there's significant improvement now! I know because I made serious progress on one of my unfinished Sims hacking projects (and got ideas for several new ones).   Okay, about those test results -- I had a MUGA scan, CT scan, bone scan and the PET scan, and yes I had my oncologist appointment on Sept 10th where we discussed these, so....drumroll please:   1. MUGA scan good -- no heart damage (I'd had a MUGA scan prior to chemo also).   2. My original 12 cm breast tumor shrank down to 4 cm.    3. My lymph nodes are ALL CLEAR now.   4. The bone met is still there, but it's smaller and less metabolically active, and, there were signs of the bone healing.   So it looks like maybe the chemo kicked the cancer's ass as hard as it kicked mine. I still doubt I'd ever do it again, but since I did it this time, I'm glad it wasn't for nothing.   Also, though, something ELSE turned up on the CT scan I didn't know about -- evidence of one or more fibroid tumors in my uterus. So my oncologist ordered a pelvic ultrasound for me, which I'm having Thursday (the 17th). Hmmmm, well, if the ultrasound confirms fibroids, this could be an opportunity for me to get rid of the one part of my body I never had any use for anyway! LOL. I just hope I don't catch any more colds while I'm at the hospital having the test!   My oncologist told me there's a \"tumor board\" at the cancer center, where all the oncologists discuss particular cases, and he wants to discuss my current status with the tumor board -- since my tumor is now down to an operable size and the nodes are clear, it's now actually possible for me to have a mastectomy. Yet on the other hand, he also says that usually for Stage IV patients, they only do mastectomies when the tumors break out of the breast skin and/or ulcerate, ooze and so on. Even though I'm a Stage IV, none of that happened with my cancerous right breast. True enough, my right breast is screwed up looking (misshapen), but the tumor is inside it and there are no ulcerations, etc.  So my current instructions, other than going for that pelvic ultrasound on Thursday and staying on my Tamoxifen. are to call him at the end of the month for after he discusses my case with the tumor board, and, my next appointment (unless the tumor board says he should see me sooner) is November 5th.   Now, on to our regularly scheduled post...   JudyNaomi -- Glad you like my posts, but, I really don't have much of a life except for what goes on between my ears -- which is why I got so horribly depressed when the chemo brain hit and took away all my imagination/creativity, mental focus, detail orientation and memory. Now that the chemo brain is subsiding, guess I do kind of need to \"get on with it\" because I have Stage IV IBC, which means I probably have only a very few years left. How's the heartburn, any better yet? Oh, and about your lashes -- I kept losing both lashes and brows well after I finished my chemo, but they haven't grown back at all yet. So I have fuzz on my head, and no brows or lashes.   Titan -- I'm SOOO glad the calcifications in your left breast turned out NOT to be more cancer! Um, as for writing a book -- already wrote 12 of them (and had started a 13th which didn't get finished because I got addicted to The Sims when I was 30,000 words in!), but I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to deal with the publishing industry and I don't want to be a \"famous author\" anyway either (I'm introverted to the point of reclusive), so they're staying in my computer. I'm happy being \"just\" an amateur writer.   Betsy -- Yeah, that's what I told myself about my Mycelium Head (colorless/sorta whitish fuzz) -- \"it's the beginnings of hair.\" My mycelium has now sporulated, just keep calling me Fuzzie the Moldie! LOL. By that I mean now I do see color, and although I can't tell if it's my exact pre-chemo color, it's definitely some shade of brown. Of course I'm still too unsightly to open my apt door without a wig, but, once again, \"it's the beginnings of hair.\" So I try to be positive about that much. Um, I forgot what PeeWee Herman looks like...but somehow I get the impression he's not what *I* want to look like! About Tamoxifen and osteoporosis -- hmmm, I guess THAT'S why my oncologist told me to keep taking those darn calcium supplements after I finished my chemo (and he put  me on Tamoxifen).   ALAINA!  -- Wow, you're back! And you wrote a really cool long post, too! :-) OK, I'll be redundant and say what everyone else is saying -- I'm glad you're OK and it's good to see you. About your surgery -- my, oh my, you must be big busted. I don't think BOTH my breasts would weigh almost 5 pounds, much less one of them! But it's good to hear the operation went so well...I'm so totally with you on the dread of  throwing up issue, though, when you said \"but I HATE HATE HATE throwing up with a passion immeasurable! I would rather be bleeding!\"  OMG I totally agree with you. In fact, my dread of nausea/vomiting was the #1 reason I originally didn't want to be treated for my breast cancer (I didn't know that the nausea/vomiting could be controlled) -- never mind a preference for bleeding over barfing, *I* felt I'd rather be DEAD than be nauseous and throwing up all the time! About TV -- I totally stopped watching TV in 2001 because IMO it went from 80% stupid and boring to 100% stupid and boring, and by this time, even the sound of a TV on is irritating to me. When I'm not home, I entertain myself with my laptop (mostly) or books I bring (occasionally). Like, I waited for a couple hours after all the admission stuff for both my surgical breast biopsy and my port implantation surgery but I wasn't bored because I had my iBook. :-) Oh, and no, you're not the only one who likes hospital \"socks.\" They're more like house slippers actually, and I kept mine -- took 'em home, threw 'em in the laundry and continue to wear them occasionally when I'm in the apt.   Dawn -- Hope you enjoyed your vacation -- and I'm happy you were well enough to GO on a vacation!   ~Lena.                  ",

      "Content": "Sep 15, 2009 08:18PM Lena wrote: Hi again everyone,   I dunno if this is a Tamoxifen SE or just my perimenopause, but for the last three days I've had really bad period type cramps, only no actual period (or spotting even -- I had one period 2 weeks after my first chemo and nothing at all like that since). The only times I ever had cramps THIS bad were when I was much younger (in my teens and 20s I used to have very painful periods, which mellowed a good deal in my 30s), or having a really heavy period, which happened occasionally. Now I was already in perimenopause for about 3-4 years at the time I was dx'ed with my breast cancer, so not only were my actual periods all over the map, there were also times I'd get cramps (just not this bad!) but no period, or just very light spotting. If I still have it tomorrow, I guess maybe I should call my oncologist tomorrow and ask, since it's really driving me up the wall. I've been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, but it doesn't keep these cramps at bay for the whole 4 hours, and sometimes they wake me up at night!   Still though, I'm managing -- another piece of my brain is coming back: I'm actually in the process of computer upgrading at the moment! :-D I'd got the idea for this upgrade originally just before the chemo brain hit, but got derailed by that -- but now I have enough brainpower to get back to it. So, my G4 Quicksilver is updated to Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11 now and am downloading additional software updates. Which means tomorrow I'm going to hook up that humongously wonderful big Firewire 500 GB external HD which I didn't have the brains to deal with when I got it originally and work on cloning my internal HDs to two of the partitions, then making a Firewire backup for my iBook. That'll  make me ready for the hardware upgrades, and I have two new internal HDs, 250 GB each, for the Quicksilver, and an ATA controller card to make sure the Quicksilver will see all that space. Anyhoo...yeah, so I guess I'm something of a geek, huh?   Dawn -- Yeah it's great to start feeling like myself again.    Chelev -- I just saw your new avatar picture -- WOW, is that your real hair? You've made incredible progress! That's so excellent! If I had as pretty a face as you do, and as much of my hair back as you appear to in your avatar, I might actually go outside without a wig! Trouble is, I NEED the long hair to make my face look good -- that's why I had such an issue with losing my hair and having to wait till it gets to at least shoulder length minimum to be able to retire my wig! And yes, you're right -- wouldn't it be nice if our hair would just miraculously reappear instantly, the way we had it before we lost it, instead of all this waiting! And, hope you enjoy yourself in NYC. I live disgustingly close to there (20 mins by train) but it's a place I avoid like the plague, I'm scared to death of it (plus I hate crowds). I only rarely used to go, and by this time haven't been there in over a decade and don't miss it! Different strokes for different folks, I guess! :-)   Judy -- I'm so glad to hear your stomach is better, and YAY COFFEE!!! I'm a total coffee fiend too, although I don't like Starbucks --  Dunkin Donuts or diner coffee for me, or even my own. :-)    Betsy -- so BOTH of us are Fuzzie the Moldies, huh? I'm glad it cooled down a little here, I'm back to wearing my scarf in the apt because even though being a mold head is good for the return of hair, it looks just as icky as being chemo-bald! Sorry to hear the rads are painful, though! :-( When do you finish your rads? Also, I'm sorry to hear about your sister's uterine cancer...and yes, I'm sure every woman in here knows what it's like to be on those \"testing tenterhooks\" waiting for results from the oncologist!  :-O Gosh, I hope she doesn't have to do chemo, though!   Ooooh goodie, the 4 hours are almost up, I can take some more Extra Strength Tylenol as soon as my herbal tea is ready...   Catch you all next time and hope you all feel good!   ~Lena.    ",

Those awful period type cramps lasted a whole week and a half solid -- neither Advil nor Tylenol Extra Strength made much of a dent in 'em, and then I remembered I had prescription pain pills left over from my breast biopsy so I started taking those. But even the codeine-tylenol pills didn't last the whole four hours -- if I had 3-4 pain free hours in any given day, that was a lot. Then they finally went away, at which point my oh-so-wonderful body :::dripping sarcasm here::: moves into what I call '\"stomach attack.\" I don't know what it is, but when I first got it the doctor couldn't figure out what it was -- all scans were normal (my doc had sent me for a CT scan, an ultrasound, and some kind of full GI scan for which I was required to drink barium), and then it ended up going away on its own, so I stopped bothering going to the doctor for it (this is the third time I've had it including that first time in 2002). I still kind of have it, but it's finally just starting to abate as of yesterday. But while it was in full force, it was as bad as the period-type cramps. Between the cramps and the \"stomach attack,\" I ended up spending a lot of the past couple weeks lying on the couch watching DVDs again and thinking, \"hey, this is just like when I was doing my chemo!\" Except it wasn't QUITE as bad as the chemo in the sense that when I ate, food tasted like food, and I didn't have the awful muscle fatigue when I got up, and even if I didn't feel well enough to write posts at any of my forums, I did visit and read (here, too), and was also reading a book (had to mostly give up reading books during chemo since I couldn't concentrate) and occasionally playing my simmies. Alas, I still had some other stuff to do through all this, the most pertinent of which was taking my custom wig in to be cleaned last Saturday (while I was dying of cramps), then when I picked it up this Saturday (while enduring my \"stomach attack\"), decided to get it restyled slightly. Funny thing is, my real hair, although a bit longer than either of my wigs, did not get in my face like the custom wig did (my quickie synthetic wig also got in my face until I trimmed its bangs! LOL), so I decided to get bangs on my custom wig too (which was originally just a simple straight center part, the same \"style\" as my real hair). Muuuuch Better! Makes me think when my real hair grows back enough, I should think about bangs. I'll just have to remember to see my friend Kym often enough to get them trimmed! Oh...errr...ummmm...about hair...TMI warning: does the hair \"downstairs\" ever grow back? I mean, I have the fuzzy mold growing on my head, eyebrows are now just starting to come back a little (albeit colorlessly thus far), and I also have tiny stubby eyelash beginnings, but I'm still like a 6-year-old girl \"down there.\" Ick! Yeah, I know, some women actually LIKE that (to the point where they shave or wax to achieve it), but I'm NOT one of them. OK, it wasn't nearly as bad to lose \"that\" hair (or even the brows and lashes) as it was for me to lose the hair on my head (totally devastating), but I do want it back. Actually I'd rather \"that\" hair come back faster than the brows and lashes (I didn't give a hoot about those -- I wear glasses which mostly seems to hide them anyway) -- and it's not regrowing AT ALL! Not even peach fuzz! I'm able to tolerate the \"downstairs\" baldness a bit better than the bald and moldy head because clothing covers that up when I go out in public, whereas it's an extra special pain in the butt to have to put on and deal with a wig (which I wouldn't even own if not for chemo induced hair loss) just to pass for human. But I'm wondering for how long I'll have to tolerate this, too. Hoping the oncologist will call me today (I left a message from him last week concerning the cramps and he never called me back!)...I left another message for him this morning, so I hope he calls me back this time. I want to know the results of the pelvic ultrasound, how it went with the tumor board with regards to my case, and if those cramps WERE a SE of Tamoxifen! Now...time to check in.... Chelev -- Did you enjoy your trip to NYC? Did you go up by yourself, or did your husband go with you? Betsy -- Ah yeah. The hot flashes. Yup, I'm still having those too. Yuck. Like you, my periods were messing up well prior to chemo (natural perimenopause, I'm in my 40s after all), and then I had chemopause. Dunno that my continued lack of periods (all I had was really bad cramps, no actual period, as in no bleeding of any kind) is Tamoxipause or not (my onc said it was possible my cycle could return, though my chemo nurse had said she thought it probably wouldn't) -- but I'm definitely with you: I do NOT miss the bleeding either! I'd be happy if I never got another actual period again. OMG, those rads sound awful! I hope I don't have to get rads! I am so sick of pain and not feeling good.... Titan -- Ooooooh, cheesecake! YUMMMMMMM! Yeah, eating cheesecake definitely qualifies as LIVING. ;-) Um, hey, is your son having fun misbehaving himself now that he's away at college? LOL And happy birthday, belated. Dawn -- A Mac Plus?! Whoa! That's an old classic! It's also the first Mac I ever saw, got to use (at work: it belonged to them), and fell in love with (although I couldn't afford to buy a Mac of my own until almost 10 years later!). If your husband belongs, or ever belonged to any of the LEM (Low End Mac) email lists (since 2003), it's definitely possible we may know or have known each other (although I use a different screen name there than I do here). The LEM lists I'm on now: G-List, G-Books, Swap List, and the Powerbooks list. I used to be on the PCI List too. Ooooh, and about your pic -- you (like Chelev) also have a really pretty face and can pull off such ultra short hair. Lookin' good, girl! So that was taken when you were 9 weeks PFC huh? I'm now 9 weeks and 4 days PFC, and I don't have anywhere near the regrowth you do. I still look like I'm growing mold on my head. The top of my head has the most (but less than half of what you have), and the sides -- they're finally starting to \"sporulate\" (show color) but the growth itself seems sparse. So you can still call me Fuzzie the Moldie. Alaina -- OUCH on the cording and those exercises! I hope you're feeling better soon. Oh, and I love BLTs too. On wheat toast with lotsa mayo! JudyNaomi -- I'm glad your stomach is improving! Geri -- Welcome to PFC! :-D Whew, OK. Time to eat some breakfast, once I figure out if I want a cheese omelet or scrambled eggs and potatoes (again! another fetish!). Ooooh hey! I haven't had my \"onion scrambled eggs\" in ages! Maybe I'll have that! With rye toast! Feel as good as you can everybody, ~Lena.",

(hope I didn't jinx myself by saying that!)...I didn't think I could fill my bladder up that much either -- I'm also frequently off to the bathroom to pee, especially in the mornings (I cannot survive without my 2 cups of morning coffee, but there are \"side effects\" LOL). Lucky you if you're becoming a woman again when it comes to the hair downstairs....I wasn't surprised to lose it when I was on chemo, but I'm shocked it's not coming back PFC especially when I've got the mold growing on my head. I'm not growing underarm hair back either. My leg hair (which was shockingly always thin and light -- how did I have brown hair on my head and very light blonde hair on my legs?! but it was true!) -- I only had to shave my legs twice a week in its heyday, and by the time I was diagnosed with BC, I hadn't had to shave them at all in well over a year) mostly disappeared when I was in my early 40s. I still don't have underarm hair back either, although I did still have that even just prior to chemo. Hmmm, now I wonder if this is a hormone thing, my underarm and hair down there not growing back at all, so, Dawn, are you on Tamoxifen? I am, and now I'm thinking maybe you aren't, and it's the Tamoxifen \"killing\" my hormones (to keep my hormone positive cancer under control) which is keeping the womanly hair from regrowing (after all, pre-pubescent girls don't have that hair yet, so maybe I've been thrown back in time?)   Betsy and Titan -- on the sex subject....chemo didn't dry me up or make sex painful or otherwise uncomfortable (on the very few occasions I actually had sex while doing my chemo, that is), but it did kill my libido as well as the energy I'd formerly had for sex -- I completely lost INTEREST in it, and only my Pack Rat was able to (temporarily) revive my interest a bit while he was here (and we enjoyed sex together, but due to my lack of physical energy, didn't have as much sex as we normally would have pre-chemo). But between his visits, I was almost completely asexual and in a panic upset about it because that's just not ME! I always had an extremely strong sex drive and the loss of it (combined with being hideous and feeling like crap all the time) made me freak out and tailspin into a depression. PFC, my libido has returned...to maybe 3/4ths of what it used to be, so far. And another difference I notice now is that it takes me longer than it used to, to get to the, um, \"finish line.\" I'm hoping some more time PFC will bring the rest of the libido back and that I'll be able to \"run faster.\" LOL. Betsy, glad to hear you're able to use the Vagifem and it helps!  :-) ....   Betsy -- (non-sex chat LOL) Yikes, I'm sorry you're having bone pain! But, to take part in your \"survey\" on if any of the rest of us have PFC bone pain: I didn't have any bone pain when I was on chemo or even from the Neulasta shots. The only bone pain I've ever had at all is from the met in my left iliac bone (which I had before, during and after chemo). I'm kind of surprised I still have it PFC, seeing how my post chemo scans showed that the chemo shrunk the met -- so you'd think this pain would go away or at least not be as intense? But no, it's exactly at the same as it ever was -- intermittent (I don't have it constantly: it shows up usually at intervals of days or weeks), and when I do get it (98% of the time I get it when I'm in bed -- sometimes it wakes me up in the middle of the night or I notice it when I wake up in the morning after a full night's sleep), though it hurts kind of bad, I only have it for maybe 20-30 mins tops -- less if I get out of bed. Must be the way I sleep (lying curled in fetal position on my left side) which aggravates it or something. But anyway -- the taxane component of my treatment was Taxotere, not Taxol, so perhaps the diminution of chemo side effects is different for us as individuals and from different chemo cocktails? My oncologist and chemo nurse had told me it would take \"up to six months\" for all my chemo SEs to fully clear...so maybe if I'd had bone pain from chemo, I'd still be having it occasionally now, since I'm only several WEEKS PFC at this point?   Titan -- (on non-sex chat LOL)...where are you going on your vacation, and when? Are you comfy going completely bareheaded now? (wow, what a concept!) I wonder if drinking enough wine would lower my inhibitions on that... Hahaha...probably not -- getting THAT drunk only serves to make me sick to my stomach and throw up! :-P   Helen -- sounds like you're probably a Fuzzie the Moldie just like me when it comes to your slow and uneven hair regrowth. Like you, my new hair is still a long way off from covering my entire head. Did your hair used to grow fast or slow before chemo? Mine always grew slowly, so I'm not at all surprised about it growing slowly now, and that's why I expect it to take YEARS, not months, for me to be able to retire my wigs and go free-n-easy bareheaded. Thing is, since I'm a Stage IV, I may not have those years, so I may end up horrid looking for the rest of my life.  Good luck with the Nordic walking. (I'll have to Google that -- I know what walking is, but not Nordic walking!) -- and hope that thing on your arm is indeed benign!   Catch you all next time!   ~Lena.        ",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2009 09:34AM - edited Oct 4, 2009 09:36AM by Lena Hiya sisters -- hope you are all doing OK. I'm continuing to pull out of \"stomach attack\" mode, I haven't caught any more colds, and those horrible cramps haven't returned either, so maybe I'll soon be back on track with actually recovering from the chemo. :-)   Titan -- You're going to a BEACH -- in OCTOBER? WOW! You and your hubby must like to be cold -- either that or I ought to get on my weather website and find out what the weather is actually like in Myrtle Beach, NC this time of year! Whoa! I'm with you on the \"not ready to be topless\" thing, though -- and NOTHING beats romantic alone-time with one's sweetie either. :-)  Heh heh heh, if that beach has a boardwalk, make sure you two go underneath it late at night -- but bring a blanket so you don't end up with sand in undesirable places.  >:-)  Ummmmmm...it's not so much that my life is exciting (not anymore at least -- I used to be flamboyantly weird in my youth, but I've gotten comparatively boring in my old age). I only give the impression of having an interesting life because even though I've toned down, I'm (a) still more than a little bit offbeat and (b) good at writing again now that the chemo brain has significantly subsided (I do still have some of that which is evidenced by occasional difficulty keeping focused with Sims object hacking and my computer upgrade projects). Oh, and about my sims -- all the gory details to follow near the end of this post (you're on the right track, though). Just wanna say hi/how are ya and comment to some other girls'  posts first.   Judy -- There's nothing wrong with having a life outside of the the Internet, or needing your rest. The worst of the chemo fatigue has lifted for me, but I do still tire more easily than I did prior to chemo (plus my anti-migraine meds, which I had to go back on a week and a half after starting Tamoxifen, also make me a little tired), so I know where that's at too. So, IMO you should just go and enjoy yourself as much as you can, and get plenty of rest when you need it. We'll still be here when you're up to posting.   Betsy -- OUCH about the rads and burning boob! When do you finish? I guess there's no cream or anything you can put on it to ease the pain?  :-( Oh, and guess what -- I don't have a cell phone, and I don't plan on EVER getting one either. I HATE the f***ing things. There's no way in hell I'd want for anybody to be able to call me 24/7, and since I'm not a doctor or EMT, there's no reason for it.  I wish I could shoot the people who use them while DRIVING, and, while it doesn't make me homicidal, I do get really annoyed when I hear the stupid ring tones all the time or I'm standing in lines at the supermarket, bank or pharmacy hearing other people's conversations which should IMO be private.   Helen -- Kudos to you for your bravery about going back to work. It's good to hear you have a sympathetic employer and coworker willing to make those kinds of adjustments for you. I don't know if my previous employer would have done that for me (presuming they hadn't had to lay me off due to the tanked economy: how do you like this one, girls -- I get laid off from my job, start looking for work, two months go by during which time I don't find a new job but I do end up with Stage IV breast cancer!). So now if I had to or wanted to work I'd have to go look for a new job.   Amy -- The Stage IV woman you met at chemo is obviously way stronger than I ever was. I couldn't have handled a position like hers without cracking even before I had cancer!  Plus I never had much in the way of people skills. Oh, I know how to be polite and courteous, but that's as far as it goes, and that's a far cry from being able to \"handle\" people! Not being a \"people-person,\" I always followed my instincts and avoided \"people\" types of jobs and situations as best I could! And I'm not so good at managing stress either (I stress out very easily). I'd just fall apart at this point if I hadn't been deemed eligible for SS Disability and had to go job-hunting again, then if I actually got a job (who in hell would hire a Stage IV cancer patient for a full time position anyway?! Especially one who was partially paralyzed from a previous stroke too?)...and then to have to be reliable and \"smart on demand\" (as well as polite and courteous) 40 hours a week! No can do anymore! Maybe in time, if I have enough of it to reach that point, I could see possibly being interested in working part time, but full time scares the heck out of me now (unless, maybe, I can telecommute/work from home).   Dawn -- My onc put me on the Tamoxifen 1 week PFC (I didn't go on any trials like you did with the bone trial), so by this point I've been on it 9 weeks. The first 5 days, the only thing I had was hot flashes, but I'd been getting those since around my second infusion of chemo, so I don't know if those hot flashes were still from chemo or the Tamoxifen -- hot flashes are a common Tamoxifen SE. I'm thinking now they were still from chemo, because while I still have hot flashes,  the frequency and quality of them has changed in the last three weeks or so (they're not quite AS bad or as frequent as the ones I had while I was doing the chemo and for a time after). However, beginning with my 6th day on the Tamoxifen, I started getting migraines again. I had been migraine free, no longer needing my old anti-migraine meds, for three and a half YEARS prior to starting the Tamoxifen! Well, I had to go back on my anti-migraine meds -- I went with my old \"3 strikes you're out\" rule -- if I get three or more migraines within one week, it's time to call a doctor. I had migraines on days 6, 7 and 8 after starting Tamoxifen (one each day) -- so the morning of Day 9 I called my oncologist. He was on vacation, but his fill-in physician (also an oncologist) was able to help me. When the first migraine hit, I'd read online that \"change in migraine pattern\" was a possible SE of Tamoxifen in patients who had prior migraine history, so that's why I wanted to alert my oncologist to the situation, not to mention make the migraines stop! Well, I wound up recounting my full prior history of migraine and my migraine induced stroke of 1993 to the fill-in physician. I remembered the old meds and even had the dosage in an old archived email (which he was kind enough to give me the time to look up), so I gave him that info and he called the script into my pharmacy -- so I went back on the meds and I'm not having any more migraines while continuing to take my Tamoxifen. At my first oncologist appointment after that, I updated him on the situation, so he knows about it now too. Ummmm, no, I'm not growing any hair on my face. I have severe dry skin on my face and neck though.   All righty then -- it's time to tell you all about sims!  :-D And no, the upcoming descriptions are NOT going to be COMPLETELY dripping with meticulously detailed and personal information concerning my sex life:   In 1999 or 2000, this computer game called The Sims came out. Being socially retarded and willfully entertainment challenged, plus, in those days, my opinion that playing computer games was a ridiculous and colossally stupid waste of time for anybody who wasn't a child or teenager (this based on my ex-husband's addiction to shoot-em-up computer games; the only kind of computer games I knew of at the time -- those were the only kind he bought and The Sims hadn't come out yet until we were separated), I was totally unaware of this game, while, unbeknownst to me at the time while I was obliviously putting in 80 hour weeks between working full time days and going to college at night (that was my life 1991-2001 with only four months off while on disability for the stroke, so now you see why I'm not a fighter when it comes to the breast cancer -- I am STILL burnt out from that and have nothing left to fight with), The Sims became the biggest selling computer game of all time. I don't know if it still holds that distinction, but i found out it did for years, and \"upgraded\" versions of the game -- Sims 2 and Sims 3 -- were also released. Sims 2 became extremely popular -- dunno yet about Sims 3 since it only just came out this year. But anyhoo -- in 2006, yes, *2006* -- not only did I finally discover that The Sims existed, but in reading its description, it was the first computer game I'd ever even heard of that actually INTERESTED me! The Sims is not a shoot-em-up of any kind. It's a people/life simulation game! As in, you-the-Player create little people, build furnish and decorate houses for them, landscape and decorate their yards, and run their little lives, or, watch the havoc they'll wreak when you let them do what they want. The little people are the sims (though I fondly call them my \"simmies\" at times).   At the time I discovered The Sims (via a thread in the writers' forum I used to be active at), the original game (Sims 1) was already \"done\" -- you could still buy it but Maxis/EA wasn't making any more expansion packs for it, and Sims 2 was out and very popular, up to its third (I think) expansion pack. Thing was, my computer wasn't nearly hot enough to run it (it didn't come close to meeting even bare minimum system requirements), and although I wanted to try the game, there was just no way in hell I was going to buy a brand new computer just to play a game! It turned out that as substandard as my computer was for Sims 2, it actually exceeded the requirements for Sims 1, the original game -- so I bought the original game from Amazon.com.....and got instantly HOOKED!!!!!   Now like I said, I learned about The Sims from my writers'  forum, so my impetus to look into it and try it myself was the idea that I could make the world of my sci fi fantasy series \"come alive\" before my eyes (plus do the same for some other more contemporary story characters I had from another story). I succeeded -- though it took me two and a half years and a lot of doing. The game doesn't come with anything theme-appropriate, and none of the skins (the component of the game which you use to make actual sims) it comes with look even remotely like any of my fictional characters) -- so I was for a time completely \"stuck\" in contemporary suburbia. How I got addicted to the game when this was the case, I dunno, but I did (and I still have and play my original contemporary human simmies, including my very first ones). Around two months into the addiction, I discovered the online Sims community and learned that it's possible to customize the game -- and I just totally took off from there. I started out as a \"download junkie\" (downloading custom objects and skins made by players who'd \"been around\" awhile), which allowed me to build up my non-human, non-suburban theme -- the world of my original sci fi fantasy people -- all the sims in my theme game are characters from my stories, and I've recreated their desert environment and culture/lifestyle (plus I also got to individualize some of my contemporary human sims so they could be really eccentric LOL), but I ran into a lot of technical problems I had to learn to overcome (being on Mac made it worse actually: most Simmers are on PC, so that's what nearly all the \"tool programs\" need), but I did. Learning to fix my broken game and then prevent problems led me into object hacking. At first I was simply tweaking my downloads to fine tune them for my game, but I also started occasionally making hacked objects. Which brings us to --    What this custom content stuff actually is: Yeah, player-made objects and skins. Objects are the furniture and appliances for the sim houses (beds, tables, chairs, refrigerators, stoves, toilets, showers/tubs, patio stuff, swimming pools and so on), plus indoor and outdoor decoratives (paintings, sculptures, rugs, tapestries, vases, trees, plants, statues, fountains, hedges, topiaries, rocks, and for my theme game I found cacti and other desert flora!). Additionally there are objects related to the expansion packs for going on vacations, nights out on the town, sims growing their own food, becoming performers or magicians, and hacking Simmers who got into the game guts to make it possible for sims to run schools and businesses from their homes. Skins -- these are the faces and bodies (clothed) which make up a sim. If you want really unique or exotic sims, skin downloading is crucially important. My Skins folder in the theme game is currently at 2,624 files (and I have a couple hundred new ones to test and install) but there are other players with 10,000 or more! Anyway, I evolved into a minor object hacker and (sheesh what timing! right before I was about to start chemo), one of the Sims Hacking Goddesses I knew from my most frequented Sims forum invited me to join her site as a creator-member. I'm not that prolific (because I'm STILL so addicted to PLAYING) but occasionally I come out with stuff that wows other Simmers.   And lastly, before I finish my Sims treatise, well, this wouldn't be a \"Real Lena Post\" if I didn't even MENTION sex now, would it? It's true, I don't have to get into serious TMI and I won't, but I should indeed mention that it's POSSIBLE to add sex customization to The Sims, which of course I've done. I have the \"nude patch\" which eliminates the blur on adult sims when they get naked, and I also have anatomically correct default nude skins and various \"adult objects\" (including some I made: I hacked my downloaded futons so they'd function as adult love beds for my theme game). So yes, all my sims have sex, and with astonishing variety, too.  And for this post's crowning tale of semi-wildness -- Sims Spark RL Sexcapades! This involves something -- never mind exactly what, since to specify it would be TMI -- my Pack Rat told me of something (the \"never mind what!\") he thought it would be fun for US to be doing (two and a half years prior to my discovering The Sims at all) and I agreed, but he always seemed too busy to get what we needed to try this. Time passed, I became a Simoholic, and then I discovered a \"dirty download\" which allows sims to do exactly what my Pack Rat had wanted US to do IRL, which he'd periodically occasionally mention.  After I got this download, the first time he was here I showed it to him using the sims of him and me to demonstrate, saying, \"Look what our sims beat us to!\" He busted out laughing, but the next time I went up to HIS house, there it was for real, and yes, it was fun! And we still occasionally joke about how our sims beat us to it -- when I'm playing \"our\" sims, I don't hesitate to tell him they did \"THAT\" again, when they do.   Well, gotta go. In the parlance of a true Simmer, my hunger meter is in the red! Catchya next time.   ~Lena.",

I can't keep up with everything I used to anymore without falling behind on something, somewhere. When I'm caught up here, I fall behind on my other forums. When I'm OK over there, I fall behind here. Sorry but I'm just too old and senile to keep up with things anymore -- especially since I quit smoking a month ago and all the recovery I'd made from the chemo brain is down the tubes and my mental focus is all back down the toilet again. GRRRR.    This Thursday (11/5/09) is my next oncologist appointment. I have no idea anymore what we're \"supposed\" to discuss other than he'll probably want to know how I'm doing on the continued Tamoxifen. To which I'd say, \"OK, but do the hot flashes EVER go away?\" I'm really sick of them, especially when they happen when I'm out, because it's uncomfortably hot to wear my wig if I'm having a hot flash, but I can't take it off and let anyone see me like this -- 3 and a half months or so PFC, I've reached the GI Jane stage with my hair regrowth, but that's still unsightly so I have to wear a wig unless I'm home by myself (and then when I'm home by myself, I still frequently wear the scarf)!   Hahahaha, only had one weekend with my Pack Rat, the weekend before this past one. Yes, my libido is back, and so is my full capacity to enjoy it, and I can molest him again too -- only now I'm too old to ENDURE it! My legs were so sore I could hardly walk! LOL. So why would I jump his bones like that again in a flat nanosecond if I could? Because my libido is back and my brain is gone, I suppose. I'm just a Sewer Rat in heat. ;-)   Last but not least...I'm finally getting badly needed dental work done by a sedation dentist (the only kind I can handle -- and this is a matter NOT up for debate). I really need five times as much work as I'm getting (severe dental phobia and not being able to find another sedation dentist since 1987 is why I let my teeth go like this -- I brush them every day but that's been it), but never in a lifetime will I ever be able to come up with THAT kind of money so I'm only getting the bare essentials (deep cleaning, outer cleaning, a crown and 12 or so fillings). Yeah, even just \"bare essentials\" are going to clean me out financially. This dentist doesn't take Medicaid (and the ones who do, won't do sedation dentistry) and that's all I've got except for my very small nest egg, which I'm now going to use for this. Sunday (11/8/09) is The Big Day.   Alaina -- yes, amazing bracelet. I can't wear jewelry anymore but I do think that's pretty.   Oh and this darn forum is italicizing my post again. I hope the bold makes it more readable.    ~Lena.  ",

No, of course I don't have any scan results yet. I'm betting that as usual, I'm going to have to pry them out of the oncologist during our appointment on 2/18. That's sorta OK, I mean if the tests and scans I already had (PFS, EKG/MUGA and PET) showed anything immediately life threatening, he'd probably have called me. The CT and Bone scans are scheduled for a week from today (I'm having them on 2/11) so it's a little soon to have results on those yet anyway! LOL. Geri -- hiya!

LOL). That is, my scans were all good concerning my primary tumor, bone met and nodes (no progression of existing tumors, no additional mets, nodes still clean). BUT.... I have a partial splenic vein thrombosis (blood clot in a vein in my spleen). Since I didn't have an issue with my blood being too thick (if anything, my platelet count is still a little low!), apparently my onc thinks it could be the Tamoxifen -- so he told me to go off it and made me have another blood test yesterday. So I had blood taken yesterday --  and go back to the onc on Monday (3.1.10).  Oh, and it's snowing again too! GRRRRR I hate this winter crap!!!!

The laundromat is not an option for me -- hell I can only just manage to carry my laundry to the REGULAR laundry room which is now sporting the two washers out of order -- so carrying it out to where my car is parked so I can take it to the laundromat is considerably beyond my physical capabilities -- even if there wasn't all the damn ice and snow and I wasn't also hurting from two recent falls. So I gotta wait for them to get off their f***ing duffs and fix the washers. Well hope you all are feeling happier and healthier than me! ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Apr 6, 2010 01:11PM - edited Apr 6, 2010 01:19PM by Lena OK, I'm back...I had my injection, ate lunch/finished watching that episode of Babylon 5 and started the laundry. Time to end the suspense... Yes, I did it. I went out topless.  :::::BLUSH::::: Amy -- you were PARTLY right: nobody batted an eye -- EXCEPT the people who KNEW me!! :-O And those who did, um...well...it could almost have been a chorus of all YOUR voices in here when you were all telling me to go topless months ago because you were all convinced I must look totally gorgeous. I mean ALL the chemo nurses actually came out from behind the big desk to gawk at me, affectionately squeeze my arm and tell me how wonderful I looked (including \"ten years younger!\") and what beautiful hair I have and how I should keep it this way but maybe get it a little styled if I want!  :-O  :::faint:::  Then when I got home I ran into my next door neighbor's niece who gasps and says, \"Oh wow, you cut your hair!\" -- to which I replied \"Well, everybody makes mistakes!\" and she said \"It looks cute!\" OMG where in the hell is this disparity coming from where what *I* think is ugly (me, the way I look presently) is what EVERYBODY ELSE thinks is beautiful?! I mean every time I look in the mirror and see myself in this horrible short hair I see nothing but ugliness, which, ironically, was what finally kicked me over to the \"OK go topless\" decision --  Yesterday when I got home from the oncologist, I went for a walk to the pharmacy to drop off my prescriptions for the Femara and Coumadin. So I'm walking, and I happened to catch a glimpse of my reflection in one of the store windows. Yes, I had my wig on, but what did I see? An old ugly fat lady! I saw that and realized (once I got the emotions under control -- I wanted to burst into tears and came damn close) -- I'm an ugly old lady anyway, who in the hell do I think I'm fooling thinking the pretty long haired wig is making ME look young and pretty when it ain't? So I tell myself, well, I'm still a fat ugly old lady whether I wear the wig or not, and since the weather is getting too warm to wear a wig anyway, I may as well simply accept the fact that I'm an ugly fat old lady and at least be physically more comfortable. So I MOSTLY decided it yesterday evening, but was chickening out for a bit this morning and wasn't 100% sure I'd go out topless as of today, like right up till practically the last minute (seeing the cancer center's van out the window, which was about 5 minutes after my last post). OK...one more story -- well how about the one I told my Pack Rat while he was here over the weekend?  (Yes, us rats were in plenty of heat and had daily doses of healthy, blisteringly hot SEX!)...oh wait, Geri requested my \"Dr. Demento\" story (which, by the way, I told my Pack Rat's family at his aunt's Thanksgiving dinner table)....so I'll tell that one. Well then...um, one more thing before I start -- don't say I didn't warn you about language when you see the F-word... This incident happened during my junior year of high school, in June, soon after my 17th birthday, the last week of classes before final exams and then summer vacation -- every course now was in \"review for final exam\" mode instead of lectures of new material. It was after lunch, time for psychology class. Yes, I said psychology class..heh heh heh, which is why Dr. Demento was the first thing that came to my twisted young mind... ...Important: The desks in this classroom were laid out in a U-shape, not rows...let's see... ---------------Front of room/blackboard------------ --teacher's desk--                                                                                                                                         -door between classroom and hallway s                                                                                    s *(my desk was here in front) t                                                                                     t u                                                                                    u d                                                                                    d e                                                                                    e n                                                                                    n t                                                                                     t d                                                                                    d e                                                                                    e s                                                                                    s k                                                                                    k s                                                                                    s -----------------more student desks back here ---------------------- OK, hope I was able to describe that OK, it's important... SO... I walk into the classroom, it's early. Even though it's review for final exams week, I carried no such items as textbooks, a notebook, pad, paper, or even a pencil or pen. Further, it's a beautiful SUMMER day, and I'm wearing a halter top, shorts (hey! at 5'6 115-120 pounds, I was almost a real live hottie back then AND I had long hair halfway down my back!) and I'm barefoot. Feet are filthy too, since I didn't have any shoes WITH me even. I'm early, though -- Mr. Beron is sitting at his desk, and maybe two students in the back -- no one else was there. At first, I sit down quietly at my desk like an otherwise normal person, but then I get the Dr. Demento idea. I stand up and begin to softly sing... \"They're coming to take me away, ha-ha! They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!\" The two kids in back are actually apparently studying, though they look up at me for a moment, then back at to their books. However, the teacher, Mr. Beron looks up. Our eyes meet. Emboldened, I grin at him and get up so I'm standing ON my desk, and once again I sing, loud enough for all to hear, \"They're coming to take me away, ha-ha! They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!\"  And I begin walking/skipping on top of the desks heading to the back row making up the \"U,\" still singing... \"...They're coming to take me away ha-ha, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha To the Funny Farm, where life is beautiful all the time, and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to TAKE ME AWAY! ha-ha!\" Until I get to the last desk in the top row, then continue back down the \"U\" all the way to Mr. Beron's desk (whose eyes are wide, jaw lowered), and I'm still singing... \"They're coming to take me away, ha-ha, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha! They're coming to take me away,ha-ha, ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha, to the Happy Home, with trees and flowers and chirping brids and basket weaver who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and They're Coming To Take Me Away ha-ha!\"  I am now standing ON Mr. Beron's desk. He says, \"Get down from there. NOW.\" I immediately reply, \"Make me.\" Without a word, he stands up, grabs me by my lower arms and pulls me down off the desk. I fall to the floor in a heap -- and burst out laughing like a maniac. I get up, and then I see all the rest of my classmates crowded at the doorway as if they're scared to come in. I went into immediate \"straight-face\" mode, picked myself up and brushed myself off as though nothing happened, looked at THEM and said, \"What the fuck are YOU all staring at?\" -- and took my seat like an otherwise normal person. The other students came in, sat down and opened their books/notebooks. I waited for everyone to settle in, and for Mr. Beron to start class. I even let him teach for maybe ten minutes, too. Then -- I REPEATED the ENTIRE performance I already described, except THIS time, as I sang and walked/skipped dirty-barefooted over the desks, I kicked all the notebooks and papers off to the floor, and, when once again standing on Mr. Beron's desk, having made my way around the \"U\" and I told him, \"Make me,\" when he said to get down, he actually pulled me over his shoulders and carried me out of the classroom as if I was a sack of potatoes -- and I began to scream at the top of my lungs,  \"RAPE! RAPE! RAPE!\"  See how much FUN I used to be when I was young, and why I say I'm so boring NOW? Well, have fun and feel good, everyone. Don't do anything I wouldn't....  ~Lena.      ",

I mean I still had the joint aching/feet hurting, but I thought I was a little less tired and moody on the Aromasin than I'd been on Femara. But no. My last couple walks in the park that I go on for exercise, felt like death marches, and even though I went to my friend Kym's yesterday (and stayed the night), I have still managed to have four cry fests this weekend.

Glad you're almost done with your herceptin...but you're probably not going to believe this -- I've never had a martini!  It's true! Really! Judy and Titan -- both of you are clean-and-tidy freaks? Hahahaha, warning, if you decide to gang up on me here, don't forget to put on your Hazmat suits first! I am a Sewer Rat, remember?  LOL Titan and Betsy -- I still totally hate my way-too-short hair. That \"70s hair\" of long and parted to the center -- was my hairstyle then and forever until this stinking cancer/chemo/hair loss/hormonal therapy/weight gain shit destroyed what was left of my looks. Dammit, there's nothing I can do about it but...well, no, there's just nothing I can do about it period, and I hate it, and I hate being damaged goods. Chelev... dunno what to say, the job market has totally sucked since before the economy ate my last job (May 2008). :-( Hope you find something, and yes, COBRA is expensive. I was not able to afford it when I got laid off. Alaina -- I hate exercise too, and I'm sorry you had to go back to the torture chamber. :-( Helen -- all I can do is hug you, hope you don't mind...{{{{{HELEN}}}}}   Judy --  I'm glad you had a good birthday.  :-D  Oh, no, I have no idea when the next Pack Rat visit will be. This is the \"between visits limbo\" where I have no idea when we'll get together again. I NEVER know when I'm going to hear from him, and half the time when I call him he's not reachable -- it's just \"somehow\" that we manage to speak on the phone a couple times a week and occasionally plan our visits. Yes, I've been putting up with this for 7 years. I can't decide if I'm too tolerant or too desperate, or if he's just soo incredibly good in bed I'm willing to overlook a lot of things no one else I ever knew would put up with from their boyfriend or girlfriend. But, I do love him. Oh yeah.....I gotta find that computer program thingie that compares boyfriends and husbands to operating systems...maybe in my next post...  ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Aug 11, 2010 07:54PM - edited Aug 11, 2010 07:58PM by Lena Hi all, I'm busy as hell and freaking out with the moving stuff -- Grand Purge is done and now I'm packing up stuff in boxes. I am extremely emotionally raw from going through \"ancient treasures\" (up to and including an answering machine incoming message tape from 1989 and includes voices from the dead!). Which brings us to the Bucket List thing: the only thing on my Bucket List is getting the f***ing hell out of craphole NJ so I can spend what's left of the rest of my life closer to my Pack Rat. Alaina -- um yeah, you sure got that right about breast cancer making you face up to your own mortality. Stage IV REALLY rubs it in your face, you know?  Seriously, I mean it -- getting the eff outta here is the only thing on my Bucket List now.  Not only did I do what I wanted to do, and rode it as far as my ambition and ability were able to carry me by the time I hit 40, I also got some over-40 \"icing on the cake of life\" (unexpected pleasure/reason to live) in the form of falling into the writing hobby (if anyone would have told me when I was younger that I would write 12 sci fi fantasy novels, I'd have thought they were nuts), meeting my Pack Rat and the Sims stuff. So getting the hell out of here and being with my Pack Rat IS finishing my Bucket List. Well, it will be once I'm UP there. Thing is, though, finding all those \"ancient treasures\" from my \"past lives\" as a musician and then scientist (sorting through and packing it all up in boxes) really did an emotional number on me. I couldn't stop crying for days. I'm better today but not by much. I've got 17 total boxes packed so far, and I'll be \"pre-moving\" as many as will fit in my car (leaving room for my suitcase and iBook) on Saturday -- it's coming up on time for what would be my usual \"summer week\" visiting my Pack Rat at his Nest in the North. I missed last year's trip because of chemo, but I'm not only going this year but we're going to be doing stuff like taking a ride out to Dartmouth/Norris Cotton Cancer Center and looking at apartments just to see what's around. Oh, and yeah, going to that little place in the woods off River Road where the four little waterfalls are (ooops, I guess that's Bucket List material too: I told my Pack Rat I wanted to see that again before I die!). But I digress...he said bring as many boxes as I can when I come up for my visit and he'll hold on to them for me, whatever I move now won't have to be moved later.  I have 2 boxes in the trunk and 6 in the back seat at the moment. It's so hideously hot/humid I'm waiting till Friday night to put more in the back seat because I don't want the stuff in those boxes to frickin MELT sitting in the hot car (music tapes, floppy disks, test pressings of my last album, hard drives, zip disks...I should've packed more books first, books don't care about sitting in a hot car, but I only got two boxes of books packed so far!). But packing is such a bitch too. In addition to my left side semi-paralysis and bad back, I'm spatially retarded and it probably takes me ten times longer than \"normal people\" to decide how different sized things can fit in a box and pack them in tightly enough so nothing will be rattling around in there. It's like a jigsaw puzzle, and I always hated those when I was a kid since I was so lousy at 'em. I was also always lousy at wrapping gifts and after some years stopped and either gave my friends unwrapped birthday presents or simply decided to take them out for dinner for their birthdays instead of buying presents! So being skill-less and clueless when it comes to those related activities, I really HATE HATE HATE this packing stuff and can't wait to be done with it already! My Pack Rat says from what I've told him I've done so far, that I'm doing great and he's teasing me I'll have \"nothing to do\" soon, but I look around here at all this abject CHAOS and seeing all this STUFF and tomorrow morning I should go out and get MORE boxes and it feels like I'll NEVER be done! He's telling me \"relax, don't kill yourself, you have two whole months yet...\" and I'm thinking \"ONLY TWO MONTHS to get all this stuff packed, find an apartment and get everything else taken care of!\" (shut off electricity, phone and internet here/turn it on for the new apartment wherever it may be so I'll have electricity and Internet when I get there, close my bank account here and open one up there, give Social Security the new address to mail my disability checks, etc.) I know, I know, I know, I apparently have a hairtrigger  -----PANIC BUTTON!!!!----  But I'm freaking out big time. I haven't moved in 25 years, I had a lot less stuff then, and also I didn't have a disability or a terminal illness then either. OK then..... Amy -- Glad your checkup with the surgeon went well and you're free of doctor appointments till Sept. (wish *I* could say that!). Congratulations about your being in that video. Not my cuppa tea, but I'm glad you enjoyed it (mostly). Judy --  Still tired or feeling a little better? The latter, I hope. Betsy --  is your MIL better? Cellulitis sounds awful! As to your FIL only being able to work the microwave, he's almost like my Pack Rat, only my Pack Rat doesn't HAVE a microwave! He doesn't even have any real food in the house (NO fresh fruit or veggies, not even onions or potatoes which he likes!) -- he eats stuff out of cans mostly, heats 'em up on the stove, when he eats at home anyway (when I'm not visiting). IMO living on canned food is OK if you're at Ground Zero (or doing chemo), but I don't like to live full time as if it were Ground Zero (or too tired to cook real food from being on chemo!). Darn right I'm going up there with a food shopping list already made out, we're hitting a supermarket BEFORE we go to his house! On the subject of food -- you asked about Wellbutrin and weight loss. Yes, I'm losing weight (on the scale this morning I was 145 -- which means, I LOST 10 POUNDS! :-D 10 down, 20 more to go), but I'm on a DIET, remember? So I can't blame it all on the Wellbutrin.  However, I CAN say that the Wellbutrin DOES seem to be something of an appetite suppressant and makes it much easier to diet -- since I've been on it, probably a couple times a week I find I'm not hungry for a particular meal and forget to eat (usually this happens to lunch, occasionally breakfast). This should be interesting to see if I can maintain the diet while visiting my Pack Rat for a week. See, here at home I plan out all my meals with my calorie count sheet (my chemo ruined brain -- which I frickin GIVE UP on it ever getting better -- can NOT remember how many calories are in ALL my usual foods and servings), and while I can still bring my calorie count sheet and plan to an extent (especially since I'll be cooking!), I'm sure there's also going to be spontaneity (such as going out for a couple meals -- he wants to take me out to the Olive Garden again, he said (last Oct when I went up to see him for a weekend, he took me out to eat there and it was wonderful, so if he wants to do it again I won't say no), and I know I'll want one breakfast at the diner in Claremont, sigh....and probably a little drinking too, which I have assiduously avoided since starting my diet because a glass of wine is 100 calories, which I'd usually rather use for EATING! About the blood clot -- I don't know what it FEELS like because I haven't FELT it. My oncologist picked it up from one of my scans (indicating blockage of the portal vein) and blood tests (very low platelet count). I'm still taking Coumadin for it, dosage adjusted at my last appointment to 2.5 mg/day. Naah, no cramps for me, just my joint aches, feet hurting and neuropathy in my arms. Helen -- How are you doing on the Wellbutrin? I actually find it \"paradoxical\" in a way. I mean, I'm sure it must be helping me (beyond making it easier to diet) because I have enough ENERGY to do all this moving stuff, I stopped crying for no reason and haven't been wishing I was dead of late anymore either. Plus both my Pack Rat and my friend Kym tell me I *sound* so much better. The paradox -- I don't really feel \"happy\" or \"good.\" I am deriving no satisfaction from my achievements, I still have trouble sleeping, my ability to perceive time is WAY off (daytimes drag no matter how busy I am, but evenings fly away at warp speed!), and I haven't even been Simming much not just because of the moving stuff but also because I just haven't felt like it much. Um huh? Not wanting to do something I normally think is FUN? More evidence in support of our dopamine shortage theory: Wellbutrin is helping me but not enough.  Oh, and no SE's for me either. Yay! Geri --  sorry to hear about your cousin's death, and poor Bonnie. But how was Vermont? Titan --  You're right -- NOBODY \"deserves\" to have cancer! Gotta go......don't do anything I wouldn't..... ;-)  ~Lena. ",

      "Content": "Aug 23, 2010 12:41PM - edited Aug 23, 2010 01:05PM by Lena Hiya all, I'm back in the Sewer, after a week just chock FULL of adventures... in addition to checking out Dartmouth, finding an apartment (I REALLY GOT IT! Locked it in, as in, I paid the deposit and signed the lease!), opening a bank account, driving lessons (a course I'll call Behind the Wheel In New Hampshire 101), us making \"banana rat bread\" (that's what I decided to call it since neither of us had ever made ANY kind of bread before!) and getting my very first cell phone (which I don't actually HAVE yet, we had technical difficulties my Pack Rat is in the midst of resolving) -- I think I'm all adventured out for now. Thank goodness I had all that WILD SEX with the really hot Pack Rat to \"relax\" me!  ;-) I'm back here and it feels like I'm on another PLANET -- and a really inhospitable one at that. I can't wait to leave! Well moving day is accelerated to Oct 1st so I better get back packing more boxes. My Pack Rat is coming down Friday after work (this week he's working in CT) with his pickup truck to \"pre-move\" as many boxes as I can pack this week/will fit in the truck. Geri I was thinking of you yesterday as I drove back here in white-knuckled, steering wheel gripping TERROR over the Tappan Zee Bridge in the DOWNPOUR! I was thinking \"too bad I don't know where Geri lives because this would be a perfect day to wash that filthy car she told me about!\"). Amy, the new link to the BCO reunion also had a Page Not Found, sorry. Oh, and no there won't be any pictures of either my old or new apartments since I don't own a camera! LOL. So the next step is packing all the books/\"pantry\" stuff so the bookshelves (as well as their contents) can go. That'll give me prime space to move on packing the rest of the stuff. The books/bookshelves ready to go is my goal for Friday night. (That, and maybe some more HOT WILD SEX when the Pack Rat gets here...hehehe) Geri -- you're not a Stage IV. As such, I strongly urge you to NOT go on the aromatase inhibitors at this point. I'd flush my Aromasin down the frickin toilet if I were not a Stage IV.  Tell your oncologist your stage IV IBC net buddy finds AIs to be almost as bad as chemo. Did you know I have to take the frickin antidepressant to fight the depression the AI is causing me? And that's in ADDITION to the continued hot flashes, stiff joints and hurting feet (which thus far I have NOTHING to \"fix\" since SAMe is too expensive for me). When I stopped the Femara for 2 weeks, a couple days after stopping I was feeling almost human again, and as the 2 weeks neared their end, I actually felt GOOD. Within days of being put on Aromasin (after the 2 weeks off Femara), I was totally messed up again. SAMe helps the stiff joints noticeably (and mood, a little) but it's a supplement, isn't covered by insurance and is expensive (I had to stop taking it :-( ), and I NEED the Wellbutrin now to hold the depression down to a dull roar. I mean crap, if not for the AI I wouldn't need to take an antidepressant! Like I said, if I wasn't a Stage IV I would go off this shit in a flat nanosecond and I'll tell anyone who's NOT Stage IV and cares about QOL to stay the hell away from it. Oh and speaking of Wellbutrin and depression -- Helen! Glad to hear taking Wellbutrin is helping you too.  I know EXACTLY what you mean, it's making life a little easier for you; having energy to actually live life instead of lying on the couch all day, and no more spending half the day crying for no reason -- but at the same time you aren't also saying things like \"it's nice to be myself again\" -- which is how it is for me: yes I feel a lot BETTER taking the Wellbutrin, but I'm still somewhat \"off,\" too. Judy -- sounds like you had an excellent vacation! That's GREAT! Um, hmmm, Oh wow, I'm glad your oncologist appointment went well and all's good with you in that regard I see my oncologist on Wednesday and I'll have to \"rush\" him to send that referral up to Dartmouth now. Betsy -- how much more \"camping in your own house\" till your kitchen's done (timewise, i.e., days/weeks)? I'm actually going to HAVE a REAL kitchen in my new place, not this barely bigger than a closet claustrophobic little room you can hardly even turn around in but they call it a kitchen since it has a sink, stove, fridge and almost NO counter space. Good luck with the bone density scan (or have you had it?). How are you feeling?",

Anyhoo, Titan, if all you're doing is exercising but still eating as much or more than you were prior to exercising, no, unfortunately, you're not going to lose weight. You'd actually lose weight faster if you cut your calories and did NOT exercise, although the best (healthiest) way to do it is with BOTH exercising AND reducing your caloric intake. A little very simple math: There are 3500 calories in one pound of fat. There are 7 days in one week. 7 x 500 = 3500. So, even if ALL you do is eat 500 calories per day less than you burn, you will lose one pound per week (unless you're taking hormonal treatments, in which case you lose one pound approximately every 9-10 days,..arrgh :-P) -- but you will still LOSE. If you DO exercise while you diet and thereby burn more calories than you would being sedentary, you get to eat a little bit MORE food if you want to, while still consuming 500 fewer calories per day than you burn, plus exercise is just plain ole healthy. My current weight loss update: 11 pounds down, 19 more to go.  I'm doing it with the combination of caloric reduction and exercise (walking 2+ miles a day, packing/all the stair climbing with moving empty boxes in, full boxes out, and molesting my Pack Rat every chance I get LOL...sex is exercise too!). Betsy -- so glad to hear you enjoyed your trip, but sorry about your mom falling -- glad she didn't hurt herself TOO badly, that she's OK now.  Oh, and that kitchen remodeling business -- it's WONDERFUL to hear of the progress and that you'll soon be able to use your \"brand new\" kitchen. Since I'm moving, I'm getting a \"brand new\" kitchen too. Maybe we'll both be cooking in our new kitchens for the first time, simultaneously? My move-in date for the new place is October 1st --- do you know when your kitchen will be totally finished? :-) Pam -- yup I remember you. I'm glad you're doing well with the clean mammogram.  :-) Yup, I gotta attribute the \"make the time you have left the best it can be\" syndrome as the cause of my decision to move -- I want to spend whatever i have left with my Pack Rat! OK, gotta go -- time to assemble the 30 or 40 new boxes I hauled in from the supermarket this morning.  ~Lena. ",

Sorry Amy, I didn't mean to compare you to GWB, just the spin doctors who were able to rile up American support of that war. Well I don't see any logical reason for this kind of panic because most of the work concerning the move is DONE -- 80% of my stuff is already in NH in my Pack Rat's nest, and half of the 20% still here is all boxed up and ready to go. Utilities (including high speed internet) are set to go on at the new place on 10/1 (even though it turns out we won't be getting there till 10/2), and all I have to do here is one more onc visit/get meds if necessary), send out a couple of letters I already wrote for 9/30, close my bank account so I can bring the money up there (I opened a checking acct in NH when I was up there), tell Verizon and PSE&G to \"shut me off on 10/2 and send the last bill to me at [NH address]\" the day before I leave. Plus spend a couple days finishing the last boxes...wanted to get a start on them this week but can't seem to get motivated and focused on it due to the constant anxiety and I'm panicking, but it's not because I regret doing this, I know it'll be so much better there in the new place and closer to my Pack Rat and this place is actually giving me the creeps now so I can't WAIT to get out! Well I hope you got over your panic and the trip went OK. Titan -- wasn't your daughter supposed to go to the doctor? How did that turn out? Helen and Judy -- I might start seeing a therapist after I move too....how are you feeling? Alaina, are you around? How are you feeling? Good to hear you're OK but busy, Geri. I guess that must also apply to Betsy, what with her home improvement stuff....? Oh, guess what! 15 pounds down, 15 to go! I'm now at the stage of still being too fat for my skinny clothes, but too skinny for the fat clothes! Well, that's OK. And maybe that's something GOOD about the nonstop anxiety attacks -- my appetite is way down, since Monday or Tuesday. Yes, I eat every day, but a LOT less, and it's not hard at all to keep to my diet. Still walking every day too. Sometimes that takes the edge off a little. I'd walk more except my body is still not up to it -- can feel \"something weird\" starting slightly in that right leg after I do my two laps around the lake so I'm not even trying to do more...I don't want to hurt myself right before the move (can you say \"mysterious leg injury which needs oxycodone level pain relief and outright cripples me for 3 weeks\")? OK, guess I'll get going. Feel well, everyone! ~Lena ",

Not a LOT of snow YET -- so far two dustings, then 3 inches yesterday. It's snowing right now but light, it looks like we'll get only a dusting or maybe an inch at most. I can deal with it being winter now because I'm ready in general, and, I'm currently luxuriating in the fact that I don't HAVE TO drive anywhere till the 29th. I have plenty to eat (boy will I have a lot of laundry to do by then but I'll still have clothes!), but OK. Yes, I am so well stocked up on food I can go WAY past a week and not run out of anything except milk, eggs or fresh fruit/salad stuff -- at all times, not JUST winter. At the moment I probably have about 4-5 months of canned and dry foods in reserve (plus the stuff in the freezer). I've been told, and now I see it for myself, how my \"survivalist\" ways will serve me well up here. My ex used to rib me for them, but my Pack Rat told me it was a good trait to have even when I was in NJ and he even said the more I did the better! LOL well he IS a Pack Rat...Come to think of it, that got me through chemo too when I had no energy to go to the supermarket. I have been brushing the snow off the car though so if/when the snow gets worse I won't end up with a serious excavation and ice scraping job when the time comes I do have to drive someplace. I may have improved on the driving thing up here, but it only took one drive up to Dartmouth in the rain to find out that my driving phobia has abated only when the weather is GOOD. But oh well, I'm still just as bad as I ever was when the weather is nasty. Thankfully, if I run out of milk or eggs I don't have to drive since there's a \"little store\" a 5 minute walk from here. The \"little store\" in NJ was 10-15 mins to walk. Wish I could say I'm done adjusting by now, but I'm not yet. I'm only just a little bit less dazed is all. Even the GOOD changes, like the doctors up here (yup OMG what a shocking surprise)....well actually so far ALL the changes have actually been good, so I don't know what my frickin' problem is. Yes, it was physically a lot of work to pack up/get out of the old place, then all the unpacking and setting up when I got here and some of the technical problems, but for an interstate move it went very smoothly (NOTHING got lost or broken) and difficult setups is just \"shit happens to everybody when they move\" stuff, and, NONE of the change is actually BAD! I mean think about it: 1. This house and the neighborhood it's in is not only a MILLION times NICER than where I was (and what I ever thought I'd have), it's also easier to live here in most ways, and trade-offs equal out, so it's totally an ultimate win. An example on the \"trade-off\" thing: Here I have to go out to a laundromat now instead of having washers and dryers in the building, BUT, I don't have that awful four flights of stairs to get to and from the basement laundry room anymore. Another example: the best of the supermarkets here is almost ten miles away in the next town over -- a 10-15 minute drive -- but it's MUCH better than the one I used to go to (which ALSO took 10-15 mins to get to even though it was only 2 miles away, cause of the horrific amount of traffic which doesn't exist here). And, here, when I get the groceries home I can be parked right in front of the house, set the door to stay open while I bring the stuff in, and only have the two steps up on to the deck. At the old place, not only could I end up parked 2 blocks away and having to unload first into my \"old lady\" cart and drag that to the apartment building, then make several trips up and down 3 flights of stairs lugging as much as I could stand to carry while fighting with the big heavy front door. That really sucked. I don't miss it at ALL! 2. I live only 20 mins away from my Pack Rat now.  3. Yes, I now have GOOD DOCTORS.  So I don't know what my problem is already -- it's been 2+ months now and I'm 98% done with setup stuff. The only stuff left to do is get the living room bookshelf for all the videotapes and DVDs, and rest of the books to be shelved, then all the tribbles, rats, coprolites, flasks and other weirdo stuff distributed around the place. And get THIS pattern: the more I got done, the more displaced I felt! Shouldn't it have been the other way around, that is, the more I got done, the more the place becomes \"home\"? OK on to other stuff... Geri -- I'm so happy your test results were good!!  :-)  Oh, and about your nails -- just gotta mention the one and only time I got my nails \"done\" (I did it for maybe a month and a half, then had 'em taken off and stopped cause it was too much time consuming and expensive maintenance) -- I got orange nail polish and little biohazard symbols painted on them.  ;-) My natural nails were always kind of yucky but other than seeming a little more brittle, I don't know if chemo or AIs messed 'em up or not. Amy -- how did the makeover go -- are you happy with it? Judy -- congrats on getting your hair straightened. Chelev mentioned the Brazilian thing awhile back and I actually looked into it -- there were lots of beauty salons where I used to live (four or five within walking distance of my old apt), and yeah, one of them DID do the Brazilian thing, only it was way too expensive. Generally speaking most things are cheaper up here, but I have no idea where the beauty salons are! Actually, all I REALLY \"have to\" do to get straighter hair is what I'm doing anyway -- let it GROW. My hair has a natural wave to it -- when it's short, the wave is so extreme it makes my hair LOOK curly even it's really wavy not curly -- but the longer it gets, the straighter it looks. At its longest, it only looked SLIGHTLY wavy, which was actually PRETTY. And part of the reason why I hate how I look with short hair is because IMO the curly look doesn't work with my face, and also for me, the shorter my hair, the more I think I look like an old lady (with the sole exception of one of the earlier parts of this transition when I looked like an ugly BOY!). But maybe I'm getting impatient when I hear of a way (the Brazilian thing) to make my hair straighter NOW instead of the 5+ years I'll have to wait till it's long enough to naturally pull down the excess wave so as to make it \"just right.\" Perhaps in the spring I'll find out where the beauty parlors are (I haven't yet seen so much as a barber shop!), and investigate more on this... OK well, I think I'm done with the ketchup now....see you all next time. :-) ",

I just don't see how a change in the date is going to make bad past stuff go away and good new stuff happen. For the first time since my old life ended, the \"worry about any new ache and pain maybe being more cancer stuff\" syndrome is actually hitting me. I suppose, if it doesn't go away in a couple days or so, I should call the doctor -- if I can figure out which doctor I should be calling: the PCP or the onc. (If it does go away, well I have an appointment with my PCP soon anyway, on 1/12/11, so I can tell her then just so one of my docs will know about it at least.) As of the last couple days my left hip has been hurting when I walk and/or shift my body while sitting. Since I didn't fall or, as far as I can recall, bang my left hip into something, and my right hip doesn't hurt like this, well I don't know what to make of it... ...which would lead me to call the PCP, except... ...it's my LEFT HIP hurting and my bone met is in the LEFT ILIAC BONE...which would lead me to call the onc... ...but that PET scan I JUST HAD a month and a half ago or so showed, and I quote from the report, \"no significant activity, consistent with a treated metastasis.\" and I've had times with no pain at all or way less than this/different quality of it during times my most recent scans DID show significant activity... ...which leaves me totally confused.  Or, maybe this is merely sequelae from my optimist of a Pack Rat. Last Wednesday night (12/29) we celebrated our 8-years-since-first-date, and since he was going to be going to CT on Sunday night (tonight) for his work-in-the-office week, I had invited him to come back Sat night. But he called me on Friday around lunchtime or so, saying \"I almost forgot but it's New Year's Eve, want to get together for that instead of Saturday?\" (plus he had extra \"stuff\" to do to get ready to go to CT)... so I said OK, and he came over Friday night. I made the \"Italian Rainbow\" for dinner, then proceeded to get us both drunk and take advantage of him (after we watched this Michael Moore movie on DVD I hadn't known I'd even had until going through some other DVDs the night before) -- we had 3 glasses of wine; normally we only drink 1, less often 2 and I don't recall the last time we did 3! What do you call it, starting the new year off with a bang, right? well this was the Big Bang all right with us wild rattie-style rats woo-HOOOO! But I didn't have any more than the \"usual\" crippled-ness after (and am proud to say I successfully rendered him smilingly unconscious as well) and no new pains, at least not till yesterday with this left hip pain...so, have any of you ever ended up with only ONE hurting hip a couple days after being a little too...um...enthusiastic? So maybe I don't have to call a doctor or figure out which one to call? Also...today I really shouldn't have done this (spent money on something that was NOT a necessity)...but today I got so frustrated with a problem with my backup system happening AGAIN, plus another more recent issue with my iBook, I got seriously pissed off because I was just so sick and tired of doing without. I bought: 1. TWO \"magic cables.\"  One for me, and one for my Pack Rat since his last one died the last time he used it, which was on my behalf, when I originally began to have these difficulties. I'd been WANTING to buy them for the last 6-7+ months actually, but every time I'd think of it I'd forcibly put it out of my mind because computer stuff is \"extras.\" I'm pissed off that this is the second failure of my \"new\" external backup system this year. I need the \"magic cable\" to CONFIRM it's another enclosure failure (I spent all day yesterday testing to confirm that all my USB ports, the hub and the cables were good and they are: the external drive powers up with green light and I hear the drive spin up, except it won't MOUNT on ANY of my machines; I do REALLY strongly suspect the enclosure's bridge circuit has failed and I am so frickin pissed off with this bridge circuit crap already due to last year's multiple incidents. 2. A new enclosure. 3. A 16 GB flash drive, because my iBook is now overflowing too, and I'm kind of mad that I didn't know to look for shielded vs. unshielded when I bought my 8 GB flash drive which was big enough until the iBook overflowed last week. I just let loose and bought it too, soooo sick of waiting to get stuff I WANT even though I only just started thinking about a bigger flash drive last week (as compared to occasionally agonizing about magic cables for the better part of a year).  Worse:  on top of the $50-something to buy the magic cables, USB enclosure and bigger flash drive -- I also chose the 1-day delivery option instead of the cheap \"normal\" shipping like I usually do when I buy something online even though that cost as much as the stuff I was actually buying. What's WRONG with me? What about \"no more spending on 'extras'\" don't I understand????? Oh yeah. My chemo brain didn't ALL go away.  :-( Oh, and I had a scare with the KVM and my Quicksilver today too. Turning the QS around to get at its USB ports during the damn testing for the external backup failure unseated its connection to the monitor and I also thought I broke one of the pins while reseating it...then thought I lost my spare other KVM cable...found it with the spare routers though... Eeeeeeeesh.   I have to somehow solve this problem with the backup system, on my own, if it kills me, and even if I have to take that HD out of its current enclosure and put it in the new one myself -- hoping I can figure out how to do that anyway. And if I can't I'll just run the damn drive bareass naked on the shelf with the magic cable. I am so sick of being useless and helpless and having to call on my Pack Rat to bail me out of this kind of thing.  That didn't used to bother me though, I don't get that either. I've ALWAYS been mechanically inept, and didn't mind having to ask for help. So why do I mind it NOW all of a sudden? Well.....catchya next time... ",

Got up this morning and even though it still hurt, it wasn't nearly as bad, and an OTC is now sufficient to make almost all of it go away (I took 2 Aleve pills). I guess I WAS just a little \"too\" enthusiastic the other night. I'll have to tell my Pack Rat about this... LOL Hey Amy (and all the rest of you who enjoy or at least don't mind the idea of air travel) -- I can't believe it doesn't bother you to be treated like the terrorists you aren't with the electronic strip searches, and that you actually think such procedures prevent terrorism. Well, to each her own, I guess, huh? Ooops I totally forgot about that when it comes to at least checking out that gym (I don't think I can afford to join, but I'll still take a walk over there sometime and find out for sure) -- MUSIC! Eeeeyikes, well, when I check out the gym, I guess another important factor for me will be the existence of an exercise in \"peace and quiet\" option. It just occurs to me now, I'm remembering when I was in NJ, getting my daily exercise by going for those walks in the park...I used to see other walkers, plus joggers, plus people riding bikes, all had themselves plugged into something. I wasn't ever able to figure out how they could concentrate on their activity (or enjoy the park, in the case of the walkers) while plugged into the music. I guess I'm weird. Yes, I like music -- even if the music I like only occasionally at best aligns with what others like, I do have enough in the way of MP3s and (yes, I know, archaic) cassettes (need new set of headphones for the walkman though) where I for only a few bucks *could* scrounge up stuff to be plugging myself in too when I go for a walk, but all the music I enjoy is stuff I'd just rather sit and listen to, which isn't going to get me any exercise, and I'm afraid I'd end up hurting myself for concentrating too much on the music while walking that I'd lose my balance if I plugged myself in.  Dunno what to do about this.... But not to worry, I have to pay for heating oil first. (and goshdangit I'm NOT ever going to buy from that computergeeks.com again: gotta warn Pack Rat since he's the one who told me about the place -- they should have processed my order YESTERDAY but they haven't -- I know because they didn't send an email with tracking number like their FAQ said they do when processing is complete and they ship), and I was hoping, since I ordered with overnight shipping, I'd get my order TODAY but if they didn't process it I'm not going to get it, so I actually WASTED money trying to get overnight shipping...GRRRRR) Judy -- my self discipline when it comes to shopping is because I can no longer afford \"extras.\" Ordering that computer stuff on Sunday pushed me just under my Threshold. My Threshold, as I call it, is a certain amount of money in my checking account that allows me to have an extra 2-3 months worth of rent, minimum, on top of whatever my regular income is (presently the second lowest I've had in my entire adult life) so I don't end up living hand-to-mouth (I've had to do that in the past and now I'm too old for that kind of stress). So IF I use any of that money it's supposed to be for NECESSITIES. Definition of Necessities = food, rent, utilities, automotive, medical and THAT'S IT. Anything not in one of those categories I should NOT be spending money on it. Period. That's my rules, and that order I just placed at computergeeks.com broke my rules so bad I can't believe I did it -- I just dipped UNDER the minimum Threshold, If I didn't feel like such crap all the time I'd be looking for a part time job because I know I can only just barely live on SSDI alone, and I'm thinking I MIGHT feel a little better on several fronts in the spring, besides warmer weather making everything easier in general. I know I'm definitely \"done\" with full time -- I don't have nearly enough physical energy or endurance, not enough brains, not enough motor coordination -- but if, with the help of my new doctors, I can solve the pain/cognitive deficit problems and finish the adjustment to the move, maybe I'll be able to handle something part time -- and yes it's OK to work part time and still be able to receive disability payments. I only need a few hundred bucks a month more to surpass \"bare subsistence,\" get back to and maintain \"comfort\" level -- I'm fairly easy to please in the material sense (LOL!). In the meanwhile, it's just one day at a time and no more 'extras' unless or until I do get a part time job (or better, luck out and find a work-from-home gig of some kind), and wait to see how I even FEEL then. Oh, and Judy -- wow, if you really think America has \"a lot to offer,\" then IMO this whole planet is really doomed! :-O Catchya all next time..... ",

Today is a good day to STAY HOME!!!     ...Except to occasionally sweep snow off the car and deck (so I don't end up with humungous impossible glaciers to deal with once the sleet/ice pellets hit), I'm DEFINITELY staying IN THE HOUSE! There is NO amount of money anybody could pay me to actually go out and especially drive during storms like this!   We're supposed to get up to 6 inches of snow BEFORE the sleet/ice pellets hit (then up to 10 inches of \"both\" after). It was snowing at a moderate pace when I got up 7:40-something (from the window, looked like an inch had fallen). It's still snowing now, pretty heavy (heavier than when I was out there brushing, shoveling and sweeping snow -- went out around 9:45, had to have coffee and breakfast first). When I went out to get at the car and deck, I measured 2 inches of snow on the railing (will measure again when I go out again). It seemed to come down heavier while I was clearing it away, but, in NH, once it snows and sticks, you don't see the ground again until mid to late spring (I knew this for years, my Pack Rat told me, yeah, that's why I wouldn't move here for so long).     Well, when that sleet hits later, I want to have as little snow as possible to be entrenched in ice (\"glaciers\") on my car and deck because I totally lack the physical wherewithal to remove THAT stuff. See, in NJ, I used to get snow and ice storms which were just as bad and worse than NH storms, but most of the time, NJ would warm up enough BETWEEN storms (mid to upper 30s in the day for several consecutive days, which is cold enough to make me greatly prefer the Great Indoors, but obviously \"warm\" enough to melt snow and ice) that all of it would melt away -- so when the next storm came, it wasn't piling up on top of the last one and making it worse. Here in NH if you don't dig out from snow ASAP, you're asking for trouble.    I think my next spate of snow removal will be after lunch. Which might be after a nap, if a hot flash doesn't wake me up...I'm soooo tired....",

Hell, the fatigue was so constantly crushing I could barely get off the COUCH while I was doing chemo and for several months after finishing (last infusion was 7/23/09). However, in the past almost year or so -- since the end of March/early April 2010, I've found that yes, I can exercise with the port (mine hasn't been taken out yet but soon; in the next month or two). The port does not interfere at all with exercise, at least not the exercise I've done, which has been mainly walking (after working up to it by simply just walking around the block, then twice around, three times around, I got up to walking 2-4 miles a day, every day, weather permitting). I am not able to jog or do jumping jacks but that's not from my port, it's because those exercises are too high impact for me; I had iliac bone metastasis). I've learned in the last couple months that I can do (still small amounts of) situps/crunches, leg lifts and pushups, and the port doesn't get in the way. Oh yeah also when the joint ache eases up enough, I'm able to do stair-climbing quite well. So if you have the energy and your doctor says it's OK, I think you should be good to go on exercise through chemo.",

Because efflux is a significant contributor for multidrug resistance in cancer cells, current research is aimed at blocking specific efflux mechanisms.[5] Treatment of cancer is complicated by the fact that there is such a variety of different DNA mutations that cause or contribute to tumor formation, as well as myriad mechanisms by which cells resist drugs. There are also certain notable differences between antibiotic drugs and antineoplastic (anticancer) drugs that complicate designing antineoplastic agents. Antibiotics are designed to target sites that are specific and unique to bacteria, thereby harming bacteria without harming host cells. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are altered human cells; therefore they are much more difficult to damage without also damaging healthy cells.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_drug_resistance",

In the bacteria that survive, exposure to antibiotics causes changes in the nucleotide sequences of the genes in their plasmids (their \"other\" DNA). This causes mutations which allow them to survive and be resistant. So now I'm wondering if this is what happens to cancer cells after you hit them long enough with particular chemotherapies and anti-hormonals -- genetic changes which enable them to resist the treatment and resume growing and metastasizing. Cancer cells don't have plasmids like bacteria do, but they're certainly mutations of whatever normal cells they used to be. Some are really interesting in a bizarre kind of mad scientist way, too: aneuploidy anyone? That's when there are different numbers of chromosomes in the cancer cell than there are in a normal cell of that type. All normal HUMAN somatic (non-sex) cells are supposed to have 46 chromosomes. Eggs and sperm only have 23 (when egg and sperm cells combine, that's where the 46 comes from).  Well anyway, I think I want to ask my oncologist about mechanisms of chemotherapy/hormone treatment resistance in cancer cells possibly being comparable to mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.",

Since the expenses are different here (some things cost less, some more) from where I used to live , I've been keeping receipts and when I hit the 6-months point I'll go through them and see how bad it really is!

Yup, you bet I felt like constant crap all right, but I'm not able to point a finger at the actual culprit, if any one of them was to blame as compared to the combination! I also agree with LuAnn and Renee's advice to talk to your oncologist if you have chest pains, since adriamycin is cardiotoxic. On that note: Renee writes, \"One thing that is confusing is they do a MUGA before you start, but not one after. Don't you think that they should check and see if the chemo did damage?\" My oncologist made me have both pre- and post-chemo MUGA scans. Turns out I was \"lucky\" -- my second MUGA was only one percentage point less than the first. Mmmm, lemme see if I remember, the first one was 63% ejection fraction, the second was 62%.  Jeanne, I hope you feel better as soon as possible!  ~Lena. ",

I had a BMX plus surgical removal of the skin mets. The surgeon claimed to have gotten \"all of it\" -- the BMX more so than the skin mets, but while she thought the margins were \"iffy\" on the skin mets, she got all of what she could see. As soon as I was recovered from surgery, I started chest wall and supraclavicular nodes radiation treatments. While having the rads I had kidney failure which was finally recently confirmed to have been caused by retroperitoneal mets blocking off both my ureters. Nephrostomy, IV flushing out, and putting stents in my ureters fixed the kidney issues (I was still having rads through this), but within two weeks of finishing the rads, I found new skin mets (including on the irradiated area -- which means they must have been growing WHILE I was having radiation!), and, I've developed ascites which is making me look 9 months pregnant (still need to get it drained!). Now that we know THIS ascites can't be from kidney failure (I had ascites with that, too) since my ureters were fixed with the stents, so it has to be from mets. So since it was possible for ME to get mets while having treatment, I suppose it's possible for anyone to. It sucks!!",

I feel like I'm condemned to wearing only black T-shirts and dark colored tops for what's left of the rest of my life...  :::::sigh:::::   I'm 3 weeks out from a BMX with no recon. Honestly, I was never REALLY able to decide if I even WANTED to reconstruct. OK, well, I DID want to, sort of, or, should I say, I liked the idea of having breasts better than not having breasts. I had been encouraged seeing in pictures how nice some recons looked and I got far enough with \"research\" as to figure out which kind I'd want, if only I could make up my mind to have it: either immediate pedicle TRAM or immediate lat flap depending on how discussions went with my oncologist and a plastic surgeon. But just as much as I wanted my Cs back, I had trouble deciding because I just as emphatically did NOT want additional surgery, protracted recovery/disabled downtime, and the complication possibilities which quite frankly scared the hell out of me.    Delayed reconstruction didn't and still doesn't appeal to me at all because I know I would never be able to physically recover from the BMX and then go under the knife again for complicated procedures and additional pain for something non-medical.  I mean hell, if I'm already on the operating table for a medically necessary BMX, then yeah, rebuild me while I'm already there, and if all goes well I'll just take a bit longer to recover than from BMX no recon.   Call me a sissy and you'd be right, but I'm all into that \"avoid all unnecessary pain\" thing, KWIM?  So I decided to let the doctors help me decide -- I'd ask them questions based on a combination of my reconstruction research, my medical status/how knowing that, they could estimate how my body would react, and maybe their advice would sway me into a firm decision one way or the other. I had an appointment with my oncologist, and then one with a plastic surgeon. The oncologist was first. She had never suggested reconstruction to me, though now that I was mentioning it, she was willing to discuss it. However, she said immediate reconstruction of any kind would be a terrible idea for me medically, and even delayed if it would ever interest me still only got a yellow light: \"We'll see, depends how you do with this surgery and maybe radiation.\" Can't say I was really surprised though, I do have IBC with skin involvement. I even had to have skin mets removed while having my BMX.   Soooo.....the cancer decided it for me: No reconstruction.  Well like I said, I had also considered the idea of no recon too because I'm such a sissy about pain. No recon =  faster recovery, less surgery, less pain and lack of recon-related complications, and additionally, I can't exactly say I hate the idea of not having to wear bras or have mammos ever again. I really am mostly a \"wash and wear\" type; I only occasionally and minimally fuss with appearance issues; I don't wear makeup (I can't be bothered), can't wear jewelry anymore since the only ones I like besides rings have tiny clasps I can't manipulate and my pierced earlobes closed up, and the only things I do with my hair are wash, condition, air dry and comb/brush. Even when it was long: I wore it long and loose. Well all I NEEDED to 'feel like a woman' was my long hair and (medium sized) breasts. Now I have neither, but that's another matter. Back to the chest thing specifically: Sometimes I do like to wear clothes that aren't sexless T-shirts and jeans, at least during the summer.    Well you know, I do  I realize how given both my medical reality and preference for wash-and-wear easy grooming low maintenance with only minimal concerns about clothes: flat is really CONVENIENT. The problem is, though, I don't think it looks good on me at ALL! Actually, I think it looks TERRIBLE -- totally unfeminine! I feel like if I wear black or dark colored T-shirts my chest is sufficiently \"hidden,\" not as obvious, so if I stick with black and dark, I can manage to go out and about doing my normal business and only occasionally feeling self conscious about having no breasts. But my lighter colored pretty summer stuff, which I used to love to wear, IMO looks horrible on my new flat chested body. There's no bust darts on any of my clothes (I didn't like bust darts even when I HAD a bust), but even so, my pretty summer clothes just plain old don't look right on me anymore. With each outfit I try on (I've been through half of it so far), I  look empty and deficient in the chest region, and/or, depending on the outfit, I feel like I look like a man in a woman's clothing.    Even worse, by the time March-April hit I'd finally lost all the weight I'd set out to lose so I was expecting to look GREAT in my summer clothes which I didn't wear at all last summer because I was too fat! Also, being slim now (5'5, 120 pounds --  this time last year I was one week into the diet I started because I weighed 155! :-O), I supposedly should be able to \"carry\" flat chested not only way better than I would have if I still had the ginormous Midsection from Hell, but when I started trying those clothes on, I actually pulled them out of the closet thinking maybe the flat chest might not be so bad, that it might even accentuate my new slimness (which I LOVE), giving me a \"sleek and slinky\" type of way to feel sexy....but as it happened, I looked awful in all the ones I've tried on so far, for FOR NO OTHER REASON than the flat chest.  :-{   And I'm kind of stuck with it now too -- prostheses would be a real pain in the butt for me (yeah just watch me try to get breast pads or forms into a bra pocket when I have only the barest rudimentary amount of motor coordination in my left hand), plus, I've already gone out and about doing regular activities (albeit only in black or dark colored tops since they hide my chest) so by now, I'd feel just as stupid going out with a stuffed bra as I feel embarrassed by how my flat chest looks, and now my Pack Rat actually said to me on the phone last night when I told him \"I'll probably have to give all my \"nice\" clothes to Goodwill because they look bad on me, they don't work at ALL with a totally flat chest, \"Sure you could stuff a bra if you want, it's up to you, but you're fine the way you are and I really hope you can just get used to your body the way it is now, for real.\"    So then....can anyone tell me: how long does it actually TAKE to get used to a flat chest?  Will I EVER be able to like my body this way?  And also, what gives here -- my man obviously loves me anyway and he made it quite obvious that he still finds me sexually attractive by \"restarting the fire\" -- so what in the hell is wrong with me here that I feel embarrassed by the very same body my Pack Rat is apparently still happy to keep jumping my bones?!   ....or should I be saving this tirade for my psychotherapist...?   :-{     :::::sigh:::::  Why buy shampoo when you can get real poo for free?

I plain and simply didn't want to be bothered. I hate driving (scares the sh*t out of me so I do as little as I can get away with) and I refuse to fly for any reason.  Plus I'm financially on the skin of my teeth as it is and travel would be too expensive even if I LIKED the idea. If not for Medicaid I wouldn't have been able to afford ANY kind of treatment at all.   2. I'm about to move, so I'll be getting a new oncologist anyway at the new cancer center. Thing is, though, whoever he or she turns out to be, I'll keep him or her whether I like him or her or not, for reason #1 above.   OK so now for the story:   My oncologist never bothered to tell me that mastectomy wasn't standard of treatment for Stage IV patients until AFTER I had had chemotherapy, which I did not want in the the first place. He HAD told me at our first appointment that my breast tumor was \"too big to be operable unless I had chemotherapy to shrink it\" and that I was a Stage IV patient due to my bone met (and mediastinal mets at the time), and it was under THOSE terms I allowed myself to be talked into chemo -- at THAT time I thought a mastectomy WOULD help, even though I don't anymore.   I had chemo April-July 2009 (6 rounds TAC) and it shrunk my 12 cm breast tumor down to 4 cm, cleaned out the mediastinal nodes and shrunk/slowed down the bone met. However, it kicked MY ass as much as it kicked the cancer's ass, though, just as I had suspected it would (which was why I didn't want it).   OK, so after I was frickin' wrecked and destroyed from chemo and asking when I'd be having my mastectomy, THAT was when he told me that the only time mastectomies are \"standard treatment\" for Stage IV patients is when their tumors are breaking out of the skin, leaking and and making painful messes. I actually had to ask him at two subsequent appointments after finishing chemo for it to sink in -- combination of shock and chemo brain so it took me awhile to \"get it.\" This pisses me off like you wouldn't believe!!! IMO, THIS is how it SHOULD have gone (at the time I was scheduled for but hadn't yet started chemo):   Doctor: We found metastases in your mediastinal lymph nodes and left iliac bone, which means your cancer is Stage IV. Mastectomies are not standard of care for Stage IV patients.   Me: So this means I won't be having a mastectomy, even if I have the chemotherapy and it shrinks my tumor to operable size?   Doctor: That's right, unless your tumor breaks out from the skin. If that happens, I'll order a mastectomy for you.    Me: Okay, thanks. Then I'm not going to have chemotherapy. If you can, please let me know approximately how long I have left to live, what I can expect, and what the palliative options are.    [and we'd have gone on from THIS point.]    But that is NOT how it happened. Like I said, he didn't frickin BOTHER to tell me until I'd already DONE the goddamn chemo!  >:-P GRRRRRRRRRR! and I am RUINED for whatever is left of the rest of my life!   :-*(     All right, then, so if I\u2019m going to live for a little while longer despite myself, my cancer is in my right breast, which is why I don't want surgery now. (Note: I  actually think my oncologist is RIGHT that surgery doesn't make a difference for a Stage IV patient unless it's a QOL move to \"clean up\" escaping bloody weepy sores-all-over tumors. I'm just mad that he didn't make this clear to me BEFORE he had me scheduled for chemotherapy while my head was still spinning is all.) My left arm/hand are already partially paralyzed from a stroke I had in 1993 and I don't want to incur any more disability, not even \"temporary\" like recovering from a mastectomy, not for \"nothing,\" anyway. If I was stage 0-3 I'd feel differently, i.e., that surgery COULD help, so I'd be more likely to do it and (SOMEhow, I guess since I have no idea as to REALLY how) deal with the additional disability in that case, but not now, particularly not since during that time I would be TOTALLY UNABLE TO FUNCTION since my left hand is next to useless. IOW if I AM going to live, I want to remain independent with the absolute least amount of  \u201cpainful down time\u201d as I can get away with.   ~Lena.",

Well I hate shopping anyway, and as such tend to be stocked to the rafters most of the time so I won't HAVE TO go to the supermarket for a month or two. Figuring I probably would be too sick, weak and tired from chemo SEs to go food shopping during treatment, I stocked up about FOUR months' worth of food and other groceries a week before I started chemo so I was OK on food when the nurse told me to stay home with my temporarily nonexistent immune system. Social obligations suck (I'm mostly a hermit, by choice) and cancer sucks. The way I see it, one doesn't need to have BOTH.  LOL ",

      "Content": "Aug 21, 2011 11:11PM Lena wrote: Well here's a definite \"odd man out\" story for you all, I'm sure! I'm almost entirely estranged from my family (by my choice), and am only barely on speaking terms with my mother, who thankfully lives 1500 miles away from me. After about 14-15 years of no contact; 1999 or so, we somehow got to the point of talking on the phone at intervals of weeks or months and that's it. I will not get on a plane to see her or otherwise travel there because the last time I did (in 1983 or 84) I ended up regretting it in a big way, calling a taxi to the airport and going back home two days later, and I don't want her up here either because I don't know what I'd \"do\" with her other than fight and I no longer have the energy for that. Honestly I even wonder why I gave her my new address and phone number when I moved here last year (what passes for our \"relationship\" began really deteriorating even worse in the year to year and a half prior to my diagnosis) -- I almost didn't. If she hadn't happened to call me three days prior to Moving Day, I would never have told her I was moving or given her the info (I had deliberately planned to NOT call her and finally make my \"escape\"), and now I'm sorry I did. Anyway, I told my mother about my cancer two months after I was diagnosed -- in the hopes that she would shut up and leave me alone. One of the things we would frequently argue about was her frequently asking me questions about my finances and health which are none of her business (I had other health issues before the cancer) in spite of my telling her \"I'm a grown woman, this is none of your concern, get a life and mind your own business already!\" and in the few months of my getting examined, imaged, tested, biopsied and finally diagnosed I was getting increasingly testy and evasive (believe it or not: how much MORE \"testy and evasive\" than yelling \"mind your own business\" can one GET?). Finally, I said to her while she was bugging me with her nosiness \"OK, fine, I'll tell you, but only if you promise not to ask me any more questions or ever bring it up without my mentioning it. Go look it up on the Internet if you really want to know the details.\" She promised, I actually believed her (MISTAKE!), and I told her exactly what I had and that I would be having chemotherapy. Her ORIGINAL reaction really shocked me. She did NOT pepper me with questions or otherwise make a pest of herself and actually said if I wanted to deal with it alone, she would respect me and my choice. And briefly (a couple of months; sometime between my second and third chemos) she did. Then she started all up again and on and off since then we've mostly been either fighting or not speaking. Our most recent was this past Friday when I came home from rads, found a message from her on my answering machine and returned her call.  I guess it would come to you as no surprise that my family was dysfunctional and my mother and I always had \"problems\" of some kind or another, and I hate to say it but one of the easiest times of my life was that 14-15 years where I had no contact with her at all -- I had broken it because I was sick of the \"toxicity.\" The problems are, basically -- when I was young (childhood through mid-20s when I broke with her) she would constantly criticize me and nothing I could do was good enough; I got sick of that and sent her a detailed letter asking her never to contact me again, with years of examples of why. Later on (since about my mid-40s; the time I finally began to let down my guard with her a little during our phone calls) -- all of a sudden she wants to be \"mommy\" and what she considers \"mothering\" is to me, SMOTHERING. She says she wants to be a \"comfort,\" but when I tell her I don't want or need that, she gets upset and we fight. I don't WANT to hurt her feelings, but alas the only way to get her off my case is to be \"cruel\" to her, and by \"cruel\" I mean \"tell the truth\" in the most undiplomatic, blunt way possible. I know there are a lot of mothers here, and maybe this is because I didn't have kids, but I cannot for the life of me understand how or why anybody could look at a woman of 40-50 as her 'child.' I am firmly convinced by the experiences with my mother that childbirth automatically confers some kind of terrible permanent brain damage on women who produce offspring.   Eeeeeesh! ",

      "Content": "Mar 6, 2011 04:05PM - edited Mar 6, 2011 04:07PM by Lena Dear Joy, When I was diagnosed with Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer, I was going to let nature take its course (i.e., decline treatment, because I knew the treatment would be worse than the disease -- I saw a friend of my father's who had cancer decimated by the treatment, and he died of the cancer anyway). Unfortunately I made the mistake of listening to my boyfriend and letting myself be intimidated by doctors. While some stage IV patients do have mastectomies, mastectomy is not \"standard of care\" for Stage IV. Stage IV is incurable and there is no way to \"beat it\" at this time. It CAN be TREATED with chemotherapy (which I had -- horrible and with long term AND permanent side effects), and, depending on if the tumor is hormone positive or negative, hormonal therapy (i.e., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors). Mine's hormone positive, so when I finished chemotherapy my oncologist gave me Tamoxifen, but I ended up with a deep vein thrombosis -- blood clot -- for which I had to get painful Lovenox shots in the abdomen every single day for a month, then Coumadin which I'm STILL taking). So after I had to be taken off Tamoxifen I was started on AIs which gave me painful joints (knees and hips), hurting feet, MORE cognitive deficits (chemo brain is forever! GRRRR!) and severe depression. OK, I know that the treatment EXTENDED my life, but the quality of life I ended up with is only infrequently worth living at best (and yes I say this while I AM being treated for the depression, I do take antidepressant medication). Incidentally, I wouldn't have to be on the antidepressant except for the fact that depression is one of the side effects of my TREATMENT! Ummm, HUH? WTF is wrong with this picture? The medications which keep me alive make my life not really worth living? I had regression at my last scan, and my next scan is coming up on the 21st. So the cancer is as under control as it's possible for it to be, but I have way more bad days than good ones. Life has to be WORTH living, you know? And nobody can answer that question \"Is life worth living?\" except for themselves. So on that note --  One more thing, if I may: Unless your friend actually ASKED you to tell her what to do, my suggestion would be to please stop pressuring her with what YOU think she \"should\" be doing and \"should\" be able to achieve, and let her make her own decision(s) with her doctor(s).",

I can't help but ask here...what if the person complaining about joint aches or other seemingly minor issues is a Stage IV patient experiencing those things as side effects from treatment? As in the joint aches are from AIs, chemo, biphosphonates or Neulasta, or the sore throat, even if it's just as temporary as the sore throat you get from a cold, is from radiation treatment to the subclavicular nodes, the rash is an allergic reaction to taxotere or the weight gain is from decadron, hormonal treatment or ascites? I don't need to question, and I also sometimes get irritated when otherwise known healthy people (who do not have cancer or other serious/terminal illnesses), frequently complain about minor to moderate symptoms -- which will be cured in a few days or a couple of weeks by their own otherwise well functioning immune systems or a couple of days or maybe a week taking a medicine which has no side effects worse than a little sleepiness which goes away as soon as the medicine is stopped/the condition gone; or can be fixed FAIRLY easily by diet and exercise). In those cases, yup, I DO sometimes think, \"Hey, I'll trade you your cold/flu/stomach bug/eczema rash/30 extra pounds for my metastatic breast cancer.\" One of these days maybe I'll have the opportunity (and the nerve) to say that. LOL However, some of the things I'm reading here rather irk me, but since this is apparently a venting thread -- which we all NEED, it's all good and thanks in advance for letting me join you in venting. So my irked reaction begs the question: Before you all were diagnosed, weren't your priorities a little different? We might roll our eyes NOW at the idea of an otherwise normal and healthy person who complains that his or her sprained ankle means s/he has to cancel his/her originally planned long weekend hiking or biking trip, or someone who calls in sick to work because of a stuffy/runny nose with or without a sore throat (and nothing else), but can't you remember your life BEFORE the shit hit the fan? I remember one particular year (years prior to my diagnosis and like the majority of mostly healthy women in their 30s it never even occurred to me I might someday get breast cancer, much less METASTATIC breast cancer), agonizing, since money was always tight for me, over the decision about what that year's \"expensive treat\" would be -- \"Should I buy the DVD player and Star Trek original series on DVD, or do I spend the money for the Oktobertrek convention where I have to pay for a hotel room and eating out, not to mention whatever else I might want to buy there?\"  Well really now, that can't possibly compare to, and in fact sounds really silly compared to, the kinds of decisions we've all had to make and questions we've all had to consider as Stage IV patients. Some of my recent ones have been, \"Do I agree with my onc and BS that radiation treatment will postpone the return of the skin mets?\" and once having agreed, \"Can I believe the RO when she says and that all I'll get is a little tired which an afternoon nap will fix, and a pink, slightly sore/sensitive chest?\" or \"What's next; should I try Faslodex or go into the suggested clinical trial for Tykerb on HER2- patients?\" or how about this one:  \"I have Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer and it is DEFINITE that I'm going to die from it sooner or later ANYWAY. All of the treatments I've had thus far which have let me live longer, save one, have had such horrific SEs as to make life not worth living. Isn't it time to stop this miserable gambling already, call the palliative folks, and be able to enjoy at least most of whatever time I have left?\" SOOOO....I guess the fact that there was no way I would have been able to work while (1) I had constant crushing fatigue and serious cognitive deficits while doing 6 rounds of TAC that took two months to even START to go away; (2) I found it excruciatingly painful to get up from or sit down on a chair or the toilet, developed serious pain in one of my shoulders which would only abate with narcotic painkillers until of all doctors, my PCP finally sent me to an orthopedic specialist for a cortisone shot and had near suicidal depression and continuing cognitive deficits while taking AIs and (3) I consider my entire summer ruined because the RO was way too positive about how \"easy\" rads would be, especially compared to chemo. (yes, chemo fatigue WAS a lot worse but rads fatigue was only marginally better; I still needed to spend nearly half the day on the couch, plus had to live on Dayquil and Nyquil to stop the intense coughing fits and topped it off with blistering second degree burns on my whole chest) -- and (4) in the two and a half YEARS since I've been diagnosed I've only had ONE interval which lasted six WEEKS during which I actually felt GOOD and that I question why with THAT kind of ratio I should be HAPPY to be alive -- this all makes me a lazy whining bitch, right? OK fine, then that's what I am. And what in the hell is this \"grateful\" and \"ungrateful\" shit all about? I am unable to comprehend that one at all. To whom should anybody be grateful and to whom is anybody ungrateful with regards to this horrible disease which none of us signed up for or deserves to have? EEEEESH. This is so ridiculous! Thanks so much for starting this thread Jan, and to you all for listening to me vent also.    ",

In prepping for chemo, I originally bought three 6-packs of Ensure for \"just in case\" and in the four months I had chemo (6 rounds of TAC April through July 2009) I actually DID drink them all up. In fact, I also drank the three MORE 6-packs of it I bought when my Pack Rat took me shopping and carried the heavy stuff. My problem with \"real\" food wasn't (usually) actual loss of appetite, it was a combination of: wrecked taste buds and this horrible constant foul taste in my mouth, I called it Sewer Mouth (not metallic though, and it was so bad that even though I brushed my teeth with Biotene toothpaste and used Biotene mouthwash too, I could only get rid of it for 5 minutes at a time tops). And also, worse than foods not TASTING right was how many foods didn't FEEL right anymore either. Bread for instance. I had originally thought I'd probably eat a lot of sandwiches (and slices of toast) while on chemo since they're nice light meals and easy to make -- a good thing when you know you're going to be totally wiped and NOT in the mood to cook (or worse, wash dishes) a lot -- but bread felt like cardboard in my mouth, and was totally inedible until several weeks after I finished chemo. But, I digress. My other problem besides food taste/texture issues was not so much loss of appetite or nausea (I faithfully took my anti-nausea meds and they worked), but rather one of being too tired to cook what few foods I still LIKED to eat, and dreading making meals because I didn't want to clean up after them, and also sometimes because even food I liked just didn't sound good anymore either...so I'd drink a bottle of Ensure, instead.  Most of the time I was on chemo I DID eat SOMETHING solid or semi-solid once or twice a day, like maybe 75-80% of the time, but yeah, there were definitely some times I just didn't want to be BOTHERED with actually cooking and eating. As to my weight on chemo -- I neither gained nor lost -- I fluctuated a little up and down so therefore ended up staying the same. (It was the AIs that made me gain weight! but I went on a diet and now weigh about 8 pounds less than when I was on chemo! Yay!)",

I was told to wear a sports bra by a nurse in the surgery department and I did go so far as to buy one just prior to my BMX, but when I tried to put it on maybe 3-4 weeks postop/done with most of the chest pain, thanks to my stroke I didn't have the motor coordination to hook it (yes it was a front closure BTW) and as soon as I got major pissed off and burst into tears and a curse myself out fest about not being able to hook it closed or figure out a workaround to do it despite my left hand paralysis, I also suddenly thought: \"I don't even HAVE breasts anymore -- so what the f*** do I need a BRA for?!\" I don't!! And I've been totally fine without one. The Chest continues to heal up, and I finished PT so I got back the range of motion I lost from the surgery. I'm not up to carrying heavy loads (or even just big and bulky) but I couldn't do that before the surgery either; between my bad back and the stroke it's been decades since I could do that kind of thing anyway. Which means, and I'm coming up on 8 weeks postop: I'm \"back to normal\" -- at least as far as surgical recovery and ability to do things I had been doing prior to the operation goes. LOL So the sports bra ended up with all my other bras from when I had breasts: in the pile of stuff to be given to the thrift shop, when I finally get around to doing THAT.    ETA: Shippy -- I was able to do laundry 3 weeks postop using the \"lower\" dryers in the laundromat (couldn't raise my arms enough to use the upper ones which I like better until maybe 5-6 weeks postop). I think it was also 5-6 weeks postop or thereabouts when I was able to clear the kitchen table of all the \"supplies\" which normally live in cabinets and just get things in and out of cabinets, as well as resume using the \"high\" dryers. I haven't yet done a MAJOR grocery shopping trip since surgery (which was on 5/20/11) but that's mostly because I haven't HAD to. I normally keep REALLY stocked up so I only need to pick up some milk, eggs, fresh fruit and salad stuff about every week and a half --SERIOUS grocery shopping is usually about every two months. I've had no problems with these little pickups, not other than my own laziness at least: when I get off my butt and go, I don't have any problems. However, seeing how rads are coming up I'd like to do a bigger run, particularly since it times well with the fact that I also have to get the fresh fruits and veggies. But, it's my own laziness/fatigue slowing me down now (my GI tract attacked me 4th of July weekend so I've been really ill), not fearing a lack of ability to do it once I get off my lazy butt.",

Even though I was perimenopausal when I was diagnosed, I hadn't had any hot flashes naturally -- I only got them once I started chemo...which pushed me the rest of the way off the menopause cliff. It was April 2009 when I started chemo, July when I finished, and at the time I lived in an upstairs apartment so it would get hot in the summer there ANYWAY. So for that whole summer (and the subsequent one, which was last summer), I had to run the ACs (one in the living room, one in the bedroom) full blast. The hot flashes -- yes horrible -- always starting with heart palpitations and shortness of breath (so I always know when they're coming, too) not only were severely superheating, but so bad my Pack Rat could feel my body temperature rising if we were in physical contact. Hahaha, in the winter he says he wishes I could make them come on command. Buuut... They started maybe 3 weeks to a month into chemo, continued all the way through chemo, then kept on going through 5 months of Tamoxifen. I had a serious complication from the Tamoxifen (a deep vein thrombosis) so was taken off it and put on AIs. Hot flashes kept going and going and going strong all the way through almost a year and a half of AIs. I just came off the last AI two months ago and while all the other AI side effects have abated, I do still get hot flashes. Now, they're not as bad and not as frequent as they were while I was having chemo and taking anti-estrogen medications, but I still get anywhere from 3-5 per day, every day, and one or two every night. SSRIs cause me sexual side effects I refuse to tolerate (I needed treatment for depression, which I got thanks to chemo and then AIs made it worse); the only antidepressant I can take is Wellbutrin, so no Effexor for me. A friend of mine had suggested black cohosh, and my onc at the time said he didn't think it would work but no harm to try it. I tried it for three months and no, it didn't work. From late April 2009 when they started up until about a month ago when they started slowing down a bit, EVERYTHING seemed to be a trigger. The worst ones were the ones I'd get while falling asleep (I would be in bed or lying on the couch, dozing into sleep for the night or an afternoon nap and as soon as I thought I was \"gone,\" whammo! power surge!). Oh, and this \"trigger\" has pissed me off repeatedly from the get-go: five minutes after I get out of the shower and feel clean in clean clothes -- whammo and I'm all gross feeling hot and sweaty again, like WHY did I just take a freakin' shower? And, unlike the rest of you who mention it, exercise GIVES me hot flashes, it doesn't make them go away. It never fails -- every time I get home from a walk (my main form of exercise) I'm \"dying\" of overheating! I used to have to strip off my clothes and jump in a cold shower to get relief (for a little while anyway). Even though they're milder now (I usually only have to change into a tank top and shorts), I still come home from my walks and the instant I sit down -- whammo! And I still get the trying to go to sleep ones. They still ruin most of my naps but at least I manage to fall asleep most of the time at night (once I kick the covers off)....I guess it's the sleeping pills.",

I was like you prior to going into the surgery -- scared shitless, and also thinking I was going to lose the whole summer to pain and disability downtime for recovery (I had my surgery 5/20/11). BUT it turned out to be way less bad than I thought it would be. The analogy I found best to describe it is this: I went in thinking I'd come out of the operation feeling like I'd been hit by a tractor-trailer, but instead I woke up feeling like I'd only been hit by a station wagon! LOL Of course, even if you're \"only\" hit by a station wagon, there is going to be SOME pain, SOME discomfort and a definite recovery curve. But I took Percocet for a week and a half (maybe almost 2 weeks), and that really helped things along. I didn't think the drains were so much painful as they were A PAIN (as in, a pain in the neck): you have to watch how you move and dress to carefully contain them and not snag their tubes on anything, and you have to empty/record the volume of the emptied fluid (I made a graph of mine: the curve is downward linear) and \"strip\" them twice a day too. My drains came out exactly a week after surgery, and shockingly taking them out and having their incisions dressed didn't hurt at all. I actually said \"Oh, wow you got it out already?\" to the nurse. And I'm the biggest sissy there is when it comes to pain: I find BLOOD DRAWS hurt, even when they \"just\" prick your finger to get the blood! So drains-out didn't hurt, but what DID hurt was when she took off all that damn itchy awful tape and steri-strips! OOOOOOUUUUUUCH! Also be careful about your arms. Even if you're NOT having any nodes removed (I didn't: \"all\" I had was a simple BMX), in the beginning, you're definitely going to have issues with range of motion on your mastectomy side (if unilateral) or both (if bilateral). Knowing this was going to happen, the week leading up to my surgery, I prepared in advance: cleaned the house, did the laundry, stocked up from the supermarket, and, most importantly: moved plenty of staple items (plates, bowls, coffee cups, drinkin glasses, coffee, tea, sugar, dry goods, canned food, anything that didn't need to be refrigerated or frozen) from overhead cabinets to the kitchen table top, so I'd be able to get at them easily. Important Nore: Do not even THINK of being able to get things out of overhead cabinets or off from high shelves for at least... um hmmmm...I still can't reach up there at 3 weeks, but I AM finally almost able to wash my hair without bending down -- so I'd guess maybe in about 2-3 months I'll be able to do the overhead cabinets again.. I even took extra \"Bathroom Stuff\" from the linen closet and moved it for easier access just in case I'd need it.  If you need or value your independence, I strongly suggest this sort of preparation. Having to serve meals on the coffee table in the living room because the kitchen table looks like a bomb went off on it is way worth it in terms of being ABLE to prepare simple meals and almost totally take care of yourself, by yourself.  Yes you heard that right -- I was able to feed BOTH me AND my boyfriend the day after the operation! (he got us pizza for dinner on the actual day of surgery once he brought me and my Percocet home). The only thing I NEEDED him to do for me the first few days after surgery was help me to get out of bed in the morning! Hahaha it was so weird -- there I was, totally able to prepare food and wash small amounts of dishes with no help at all, but I could NOT even get out of bed by myself! But on the fourth morning I think it was, I was able to get out of bed on my own. Recovery is perceptibly slow until you get your drains out. Once you get your drains out, you actually start noticing still slight, but definite day by day improvements, in terms of being able to do more things, like taking showers and getting dressed, or how active you can be,  I don't suggest being any more active than you HAVE to be, i.e., not too much beyond basic activities of daily living, but some is OK. When you start to get tired (or feel pain/tightness even if you took your pain meds), though, slack off, pronto. Pain pills might make you mentally lazy for awhile too.  Since I'm only moderately active normally when it comes to physical activity  -- I like to go for walks/run all my little in-town errands on foot, like to be able to do all my own housework with little or no help, plus container gardening on the deck (I did my planting the day after my drains came out!), but most of the things I REALLY enjoy involve me being seated in front of a computer or with a book in hand -- I'm sure my life was considerably less disrupted from this than someone who's a gym rat, has a very physically demanding job, or has to run after little kids, so for me, having to \"slow down\" to recover hasn't been too frustrating.  And, maybe you can take encouragement from THIS.....exactly two and a half weeks after my surgery, I was pleasantly surprised with my first post-BMX sex! Yeah, it was my boyfriend's idea, but that's only because of body image issues on my part (it's hard to feel sexy-confident when your chest looks like a science experiment gone awry), plus, I couldn't think of a position in which there would be no physical contact with my chest, which still felt a bit on the \"raw\" side (still does, too, but like the range of motion/how much I can do before I get tired things, I'm feeling slight but definite daily improvements with the rawness now too). But HE figured it out -- a way for us to do it with ZERO chest contact and maximal contact ELSEWHERE. ;-) ;-) ;-) woo-HOO!  (mechanical designers know how to make all the parts fit!) hee hee hee So that's how I'm coping, anyway. That, and with some physical therapy (started this week). Hope you find it helpful enough to not be so terrified. I'll never call it a party, but compared to chemotherapy and hormonal treatments -- mastectomy IS a walk in the park! All the best! ",

I hope you're OK -- get the biopsy report yet? Back to our regularly scheduled conversation: I was 47 and in perimenopause when I was diagnosed. As in yes, I was technically premenopausal, but just beginning to START menopause.  From around 2-3 years prior to my diagnosis, my periods started going from almost clockwork regular in terms of both timing and flow amounts to all over the map -- I'd skip one, get some early, some late, some very heavy, some only spotty and various combinations of timing and flow which were so unpredictable I was buying that big box of 80 \"mixed size\" Tampax with all the different size tampons AND pads, both heavy \"diaper\" kind and very thin pantiliner kind -- I could have run a \"Feminine Products Shop\" right out of my linen closet! I wasn't having hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms but yeah the periods seemed to be on their way out. So when I was 47 and got my BC diagnosis, I was in the \"I still menstruate but my periods are really bizarre\" stage. I had had my last period prior to diagnosis, about 2-3 weeks before the diagnosis. Then I started chemo on April 9, 2009, and got a period, actually on time, and the ONLY \"normal\" one I'd had in YEARS, the week before my second chemo infusion. That period came on April 22, 2009 and was the last one I ever had. So even if my chemo regimen (6 rounds of TAC) wouldn't have caused PERMANENT menopause in a younger woman (or one who was still regular), it's no surprise it shut MY cycles down for good. I don't miss my period, but I hate everything ELSE about menopause. I used to think that not having a period anymore would be the one and ONLY good thing about getting old (which I really didn't want to do anyway), so when the onc and chemo nurse said I'd probably go all the way into permanent menopause from chemo, I wasn't upset because I didn't want to have children and I hated having periods anyway. I never even thought of the OTHER aspects of menopause, probably since I wasn't having any of them so they didn't even occur to me. Well, with my 20/20 hindsight, if it was possible, I would gladly take the periods back because I positively HATE all the other stuff about menopause worse than I hated having my period! Chemo, Tamoxifen (for the 5 months I took it -- onc took me off when he found the blood clot on one of my scans) and AIs have given me horrible hot flashes, painfully stiff hips and knees, insomnia and depression (which I have to take meds for), and hurting feet and hands. I'd rather bleed and feel like hell for 4-5 days a month and then be good the rest of the time, than feel the way I do now ALL THE TIME, day in and day out, no respite, and the only \"cure\" being to die of cancer -- like a 90-YEAR-OLD!! and I'm \"only\" about to turn 50 in a couple of months. BEING OLD SUCKS! GRRR! >:-P ",

I did major shopping and stocking up and \"preparing\" prior to starting chemo so I only had to buy perishables (milk and eggs, sometimes cheese or yogurt or pudding too) during my entire time on chemo. Good thing, since I was one of the ones whose fatigue was constant and crushing -- I don't think I had ANY \"good\" days at ALL after my 3rd round (I got 6 rounds of TAC) -- but, I was still able to drive to the store to get the milk and eggs even when I felt like complete crap.  My cancer center's social services department had a transportation van which patients could sign up for to get rides to and from treatment sessions and oncologist appointments, so I signed up for that and always had rides for infusions, Neulasta shots, blood tests and checkups. Also, prior to chemo, I found and switched to a local pharmacy who would deliver too, in the event that my chemo nurse or oncologist would call in medication at a time I was too sick or tired to go pick it up myself.",

      "Content": "Mar 15, 2011 09:57AM - edited Mar 15, 2011 10:01AM by Lena No, hadn't heard of lumpectomy on Stage IV patients at all until seeing this thread. In fact, the oncologist who diagnosed me (with Stage IV at the gate) and began my treatment told me, AFTER I had finished the chemo, which I had done for the sole reason of shrinking my ginormous tumor enough to make a mastectomy POSSIBLE -- that MASTECTOMY was not standard of care for Stage IV. Lumpectomy was never even mentioned to me, probably because for MY treatment plan it would have been completely irrelevant: my entire right breast had been transformed from a breast with cancer in it to a cancer with breast in it! Anyway, this doctor said that for Stage IV patients, the only time it was standard to perform a mastectomy would be if tumor was breaking out from the skin of the breast, which causes painful, oozing, smelly sores -- a real mess -- and I didn't have that problem. So no yucky escaped tumor = no breast surgery for me. At our last appointment (March 2nd) my new oncologist, however, was beginning to sing a different tune (with regards to mastectomy, I mean), at least as of our last appointment, but she said she wanted to see the result of my next scans first before she said any more about it. As of now, however, I'm going to guess that between my upcoming scan result and the addition to a very recent development (as of two nights ago) that she'll probably sing this same tune a little louder, with or without some harmonies I may consider too dissonant for my ears -- but that would be a subject for another thread. In the meanwhile, I hope you're feeling as good as you can possibly feel! ",

MommyQ, that's awesome that you enjoyed the pho -- can't wait for my tastebuds to get normal.  And hooray for the lump just being fluid! Clarrn, did you have low white blood cell counts?  I did too -- ended up in the hospital with neutropenic fevers on my first 2 rounds of A/C, then they reduced the dose by 25% and put me on Cipro.  That seems to have worked. Longislandl8y, have a good weekend with your little dog - he sounds like a sweetie!  We have a little white poodle mix named Star who may be about the same size.

Footballnut, good job working out - 40 mins on the treadmill is awesome!  I have tried to keep to my exercise routine too but I've definitely had to cut back.  I totally get obsessing about things like your nail -- I do the same and it almost always turns out to be nothing.  I agree that your dermatologist should get you in early so you don't have to stress about it! ColdinCanada, so glad to hear you got some good sleep.  How old are your babies? SharonDe, that photo of your dog's fatigue is too cute!!  I feel the same way.  :-)  I am here at the beach with my husband, MIL, and 3 kids.  I have spent a lot more time in the rental condo sleeping than on the beach or at the pool, but I'm glad my kids are having fun since they had to miss out on a couple of other trips due to my diagnosis.  I have felt like I stand out when I do go to the beach or pool because I'm wearing a cap and weird tops to cover up my port, etc.  Truth be told, no one is probably paying any attention.  :)",

Chemo brain has definitely affected me. Clarrn, what a beautiful beach!   Timbuktu and Lilyrose, sorry to hear you have had digestive problems too.   We came back from the beach today.  I was happy to be home and had decent energy, enough to get a lot of laundry done and things unpacked.  I also had a good appetite this evening, which is unusual -- I have had very little appetite since starting chemo.  I do seem to be losing my eyelashes.  The ones on the bottom started falling out first.  The hair on my head has not all fallen out - I still have probably 10-20% of it as stubble.  So maybe I will keep a few eyelashes too?  Hard to say!
