But as I look back, the pain did get better over time, and I'm actually scheduled for the exchange surgery on Monday.  I can't wait.  The bottom line is that you have to do enough research and talking to doctors/geneticists to provide yourself with a platform of information that is robust enough for you to make the decision that feels right for you.  It's not a one size fits all and there are lots of options. Hang in there....Faith )_+",
