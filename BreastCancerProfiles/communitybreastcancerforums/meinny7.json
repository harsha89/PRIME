      "Content": "meinny7 wrote: My wife was diagnosed with IDC Grade 3, 1cm agressive (surgeon's words) this last Friday. Our lives have gone from ordered to chaotic in the space of 24 hours. My wife of 35 years (my high school sweetheart) is in shock while trying to put on a good front for our youngest daughter (17yo) still at home. I believe she is beginning the progression through grief (denial, anger, depression, and acceptance), but only has 1 week to make the entire journey since her surgeon has given her 1 week to schedule due to his feeling that the agressiveness of the carcinoma demands expediency. She wants and needs a 2nd opinion which we can hopefully get within the 1 week time frame, and while the Internet is good for information it is also replete with some very scary imagery and quackery as well.  I am posting since she is still trying to get her mind and thoughts around her diagnosis. Hopefully once she reaches acceptance and begins to formulate a plan of action, she will participate with me in this forum.  As a husband with a terminal form of brain cancer I can understand a bit of what she is going through, but I will be the first to say that no man can fully understand the impact that the diagnosis of agressive BC has on a woman. I only know how it is making me feel. I want to help her, but she needs her space for now, but I can't let her take too long or we may have to deal with metastistic problems. Her surgeon feels he can completely remove the IDC and has said her possible recovery probability is very high assuming she doesn't wait very long to make up her mind. Reading the entries here of others having received similar news is very helpful, and I hope that very soon my wife can join me in reading them. We are just beginning the journey and trust that we will grow closer regardless of the outcomes. Thanks for providing this forum for those living with and helping to support those with BC.

I am very heartedly insisting that my wife take the time to get a 2nd opinion regardless of the surgeon's deadline since I too believe that it would be better than rushing into something for which later may show the decision was ill-informed. However, being in an area where \"expert BC medical personnel\" are most likely rare, and having to deal with insurance/finance issues of being a small business person, there are things that must be overcome in order to get that expert 2nd opinion. I am hoping to get her another surgeon that is more sensitive to her needs and hopefully get her open up this week once she come to grip with the issue. Thanks for everything, and I will report back as the events unfold this week. More later... Nanouk",

She made up her mind about her treatment course without any input from me, and doesn't want to discuss it or have anyone else discuss it either, I guess. I know her and for me to continue would be causing her to dig her heels in. I am completely in the dark about what she wants to do next and so I can only talk about my feelings or issues which seem rather pointless. Thanks again, friends, even though it was only a short acquaintance. I have another blog/journal that I will keep going but it will only be what a husband is going through without any reference to his wife's condition. I am sure this is not unique to the way some people diagnosed with a life changing malady react sometimes. Thank you again, all. I trust I did not waste anyone's time or breach any normal protocols. I will deactivate my registration so I can tell my wife I complied with her wishes.",
