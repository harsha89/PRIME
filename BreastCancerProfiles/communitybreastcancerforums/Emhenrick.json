I have an area in my right breast, it's about 2 inches by 1.5inches, it feels quite nodular, with areas that feel harder than others. Some areas feel movable but others don't. Doctor said not to worry could be due to my period, which has now began and no change in my breast. It's painful, which reassures me. My aunt had BC and died from mets, my nan had BC but lived to be 87 and my grandad had lung cancer. The doctor has referred me to the one stop breast clinic this Thursday, but I would really like some advice. Eg how yours felt? Was it painful? Any information would be really appreciated, I'm a nurse, so hopefully this has made me more paranoid! Thanks guys! Log in to post a reply",
