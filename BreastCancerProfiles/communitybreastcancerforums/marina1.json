I ended up having 2 plastic surgeon opinions and actually decided to do a bilateral with immediate reconstruction with implants. The 2nd ps was more conservative and i appreciated that - I have a heart arrthymia and she asked if the added risk of a lengthier surgery was really worth it. It really isn't plus with 2 small kids i really do need to have a quicker recovery. So what happens? I can't get the bs and ps until nov.12. I'm going to go nuts waiting that long primarily because no nodes were ever taken and I have no idea what else is going on. So i'm now thinking of having a 2nd lumpectomy (fully expecting not to get clear margins since 5 of 6 sides were not clear on the 1st) and then having more information and keeping the bilateral scheduled for the 12th. Am I totally nuts? Going for another lumpectomy knowing full well if they DO have clear margins I still want a bilateral? Of course the bs isn't in until Tuesday....i really want to go see an oncologist but without node information at a minimum i really have nothing to discuss. any advice?",

So lumpectomy w/radiation vs. mastectomy decision has to be made. History: 1 sister diagnosed with stomach cancer 2 years ago- passed away 2 weeks ago. Another sister diagnosed with DCIS last year, stage 0 and had mastectomy. My pathology report talks about a \"shotgun\" pattern. I'm leaning to mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. People think I need a 2nd opinion. No tests caught this cancer - not MRI, not ultrasound. Only radialogist/surgeon that said something on mamo looks \"funny\". My view is what's the alternative? How can I ever trust tests knowing that I got to stage 1 with nothing other than someone's good eye for reading mamos. Open to any comments, suggestions, questions !!! tks.

My bs spent alot of time on the options and left me to decide. The worst time is in between dr. appts and researching and getting more confused. Finally met with ps yesterday (2nd opinion tomorrow) and for me, am opting for bilateral tram. For me bilateral because of extensive DCIS and shotgun pattern of IDC and only 1 clear margin, family history of cancer (in general) and because i'm 48 and don't want to worry about any recurrence in the other breast (odds increase 1%/year i believe - i don't want to be 70 worrying about another mastectomy. If I wanted the easier way out (so to speak) I would do the lumpectomy with the radiation. I personally didn't feel I could relax with this last option. I think for me it's reading all these inputs and then understanding that there are pros and cons to everything and ultimately the success is the surgeon and how your body reacts to the surgery. I know i'm in for a long recovery. I'm comfortable with my surgeons and their skills. I'm just hoping that my past history of decent recoveries from surgeries continues with this one. Evaluate all your options and then figure out what you can live with. Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. I feel that's the decision i'm making. Not sure that helps you but it has helped me get through this last week of mental anguish.",

Guess it's in God's hands that it goes as well as my surgery went and He gives me the strength to stay positive. Between the surgery and my nerves regarding chemo, I've been a little down because I just don't have it in me to give the kids the Christmas they want. But- I am recovering well from the surgery and I just hope that chemo treats me well :)  I pray for strength for all of us........Marina",

Tough surgery and recovery but it seems in the last few days I can finally avoid taking my muscle spasm pills...it's gotten much better. I'm walking better and feeling a little more energetic (maybe cause of the sterioids?). That frankly has been the only thing that \"bothered me today\".....gets me woozy and not sure there's anything to stop that. But the chemo today went well. The port surgery went great yesterday. 30 minute procedure- longest wait is from radiology to ensure the chest xrays looked good before they released me. I didn't feel anything go through it today (no stinging, warmth, nothing). Just watched tv and read. I do hear day 1 and 2 may be easier so I won't be singing yippee quite yet but I'm ready for whatever SE decides to get me. But so far today's been \"easy\". The way I look at it, I had 4 straight weeks of something bothering me everyday from surgery.....3 or 4 bad days for 6 treatments every 3 weeks is going to be doable. Did you have your 2nd opinion on chemo?",

When my lumpectomy report came back as shotgun pattern of IDC, I knew in that I couldn't be confident that another lumpectomy would give me clear margins especially since none of the exams (Mamo, MRI and ultrasound could confirm any area). So I was sure about the one mastectomy.The decision for the bilateral was mine. I didn't trust the tests and I didn't want to potentially face this same issue 20 years from now...plus my sister had just had DCIS and a unilateral and told me she had just wished she had done the other. That was my thought pattern for the bilateral. Yesterday went great with my first chemo and i made a mistake to take ducolax last nite.....had the runs today and felt a little tired. my hemo was 9.6 yesterday (i have anemia to start so figured between that and surgery i'd be lower than they'd like). So really took it easy today. No food issues (i.e naseau (yet)). ports aching me a little. other than that...round 2 is on 27th. Trying to figure out when to cut my hair- i've got my wig and i hear around 16-17 days is the magic time. I may wait til next week. Lou, so happy you're feeling great........",

I was due for chemo thurs and will now delay it so I can fully recover. Has this happened to anyone? Do you pick up where you left off on chemo? Do they change regimen? I'm trying to behave so these don't open up but not sure that's something I can control. This time they didn't use dissolving sutures so hopefully I have better luck.
