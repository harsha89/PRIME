Obviously, cancer is not my area of expertise, but I have taken care of a fair number of patients with it. It has all become so much more personal since my own diagnosis. I was just reading about fasting mimicking diets. Has anyone else read about these? Search chemolieve. The science seems to be sound. I am thinking about trying a fasting protocol prior to chemo.
