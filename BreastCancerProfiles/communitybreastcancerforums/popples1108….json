She was recently re-diagnosed with IDC. We just left the oncologist and have learned she will need 16 weeks of chemo, then a bilateral mastectomy, then possibly radiation again (on the armpit) depending on what the lymph nodes show. We also know that the tumor is 1.5cm, triple negative and Ki67 is 80%. Can someone explain a little more about what all this means, is this something that's beatable/how bad is it?
