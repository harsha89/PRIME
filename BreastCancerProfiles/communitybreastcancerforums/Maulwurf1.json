Reason I was looking for a place like this is that the pain is so excrutiating, I just don't know what to do. Seeing a new PS tomorrow, never liked the one I had, but the Nurse navigator insisted. He comes highly recommended, but only from his nurses, haven't met one patient of his.Anyways how strong should the pain be 3 weeks after surgery?",

I think the reason my pain is so strong is because I am a landscaper and 60-70 % off my job is laying paver patios, so my pecs are maybe more developed then a woman who might work on a computer? Not sure, but at this point it is becoming worrisome that I might never do my job again. Thanks for listening, I really regret not having found this group before. So glad I am here now.",

Seeing a new oncologist for a second opinion today. The first one recommended Tamoxifen, but it was so soon after my first surgery I can't remember a darn thing she said. She just threw all kinds of statistics my way. So I had my second surgery in May, and I should be done, except I have such pressure in the breasts it feels like I am wearing a sports bra that's 5 sizes to small, all the way around the back. So my surgeon said if I don't get better by September she'll consider removing the implants and putting them on top of the pectorials, which is what I wanted to begin with. The only thing holding me back is the thought of doing lipo again, that's just too long of a recovery. I am still way swollen from that. Anyways I am whining. Reading all the messages I realize I should have come here more often. I feel like I lived in a box all those months and having to see the Oncologist today, I am forced to face my situation finally. Thanks for listening, Andrea",

So know they want to chemically induce menopause with monthly shot and then put me on Anastrozole. I am not sure all the side effects are worth the outcome. Sometimes one has to consider quality of life. The other option is taking out the ovaries, but I al already possibly facing another breast surgery. And I am so very slow in recovering.
