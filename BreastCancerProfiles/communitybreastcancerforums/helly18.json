I am shocked as this started out late last summer as being recalled after mammogram as some microcalcifications seen which were biopsed twice and found to be atypical flat something cells and placed on annual screening. About 2 months after the biopsy a lump came up at the site and my gp, surgeon radiologist all thought it was a fat necrosis but erred on side of caution and biopsies again which was repeated beginning of January'. So 4 biopsies and 6,7 mammograms to get here! I need to have another stereotactic on Monday as there are 2 areas to look at but surgery and sentinel node biopsy planned. I am 48 with 2 10 yr olds and am very shocked at present. Log in to post a reply",
