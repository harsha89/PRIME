I started a new thread because I was unfamiliar with how this site worked but am posting this in the existing thread, as I should have in the beginning. Has anyone waited more than 6 weeks between surgery and the SAVI? I had a partial mastectomy on 3/21 (My surgeon says they're not really lumpectomies because they take more tissue than the lump alone--in my case, a LOT of tissue.) for invasive ductal carcinoma. I was blessed with clear margins, no nodes. I was supposed to have the SAVI device placed last Thursday, 3 weeks post-op, but the surgeon's office had neglected to contact my insurance to get pre-authorization, so I was sent home. Now they've messed up again, and it looks like it will be after sometime after the 6-week mark before I'll get the device and start radiation. I was told 6 weeks was the maximum interval. I'm sure it varies from patient to patient, as people heal at different rates. However, this delay is making me uneasy. I can't have conventional radiation, so it's either the SAVI or a mastectomy, which I do NOT want. ",
