My oncologist was recommending the accelerated treatment because it is less disruptive to my daily life to go for three weeks than to go for six. So, that is why I am asking what is the down side to doing the accelerated treatment?",

My radiologist turned me down for the accelerated treatment because the areas to be treated were angled in a way that made it impossible.

My oncologist told me that I am a good candidate for Accelerated Radiation treatment in which they will give me higher doses for three weeks instead of the usual six week plan. Does anyone have any experience with this? I've been told that the side effects and effectiveness of the treatment are the same with the accelerated treatment as with the non-accelerated treatment. Is that true? Thanks so much. The purpose of life is to be happy. Dx 8/17/2007, DCIS, 1cm, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
