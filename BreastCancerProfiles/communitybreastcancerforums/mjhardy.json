I feel so much better and in control of my situatoin. I love my 3rd wig so much and I feel like they can fix the other 2 so I will feel better about them too.  I encourage you to not stop until you find something that you feel good in.  It has made all the difference to me.  My hair is now coming out in handfuls and I'm getting it all cut off with my friends tomorrow at 7am before my hairdresser's shop opens.  I feel so in control and ready.  I hope you get there - I really sympathize with you.",

I bought a few scarves and a hat and I'm sure I'll buy more.  I am very visible at my company and the thought of walking into work that first day with a wig on scares the you know what out of me.  Round 2 is in 2 days...I'm doing 4 cycles of A/C every other week, 4 cycles of Taxol every other week, then radiation, then tamoxifen for 5 years.  \"nice\" to be part of the group.",

I'm getting my hair shaved off on Saturday morning and hopefully my hairdresser can help shape my wigs.  2 of my girlfriends are coming with me...I've got to get to a place where I feel good enough (looking) to go to work.  I just don't want to be \"the sick person\" and I'm worried that the wig look is going to make me look phony or sick. ",
