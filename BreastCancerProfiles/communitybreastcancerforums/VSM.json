On a positive note, the doctors feel comfortable having you wait 3 months and get rechecked, instead of calling you back for more tests immediately.  Unfortunately, you need to get some peace of mind or your next 3 months will be very difficult.  Know that it is always alright to call the doctors or clinics and ask questions-after all, it is YOUR body, and you can't make your own decisions about what is best for your own body, if you don't know what you're deciding on.  If you haven't already done so, I suggest that you request your images and the reports so that you know what the doctors have concluded.

Without giving all the gorry details--I heard all kinds of conflicting information between all the techs, nurses, radiologists, and GYN.  In many places now the radiologist does the biopsies, but I didn't feel comfortable with my interactions with him (unfortunately, the doctor we feel comfortable with is not always there for the biopsy)...EVERYONE else in the clinic was noce though and most of them understand your stress and want to calm you. The conflicting information I got in the clinic was a bit stressful for me, so I actually set a follow-up with my BS because I felt he was the one who wanted all of it done in the first place--that took about 2 (painfully long) weeks to get to talk to him.  I would ask whichever doctor you feel most comfortable with/or was the one who requested the exams, etc. I hate to tell you, but in my situation we ended up with more questions than answers--I'm playing the \"watchful waiting\" game until my next follow up... The unknown is scary, but I want you to know I'm glad you're going to get this done!!  After rereading this, I think I might have made it sound worse than it was....I looked at it as \"just another routine checkup\" and I was much more calm.  Just remember, you're not alone and we're all sending out our support to you!",

A number of positives jump out when I read your post--you are being proactive and following up on your health care.  Unfortunately, many of us play this waiting game (and we know the game it plays with our minds)--6 weeks seems like an eternity, but it's on the calendar and will get here soon--that's definitely a positive.

Atypical cells means that the \"cells are changing\"--it does not mean the cells have already changed to cancer--in some cases they never change to cancer, but the duct excision is the next step to get the stuff out.  I'm also attaching a couple of other links I found helpful. http://www.neomatrix.com/healthcare/Nipple-Aspirate-Fluid-Information.aspx http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/164 Others will be along soon--you can also type \"duct excision\" in the search engine at the top of this page and it will bring up other posts on the subject.  We're here--keep us informed.   ",

I'm glad you are writing a list of questions for the BS.  While I tend to want to do my doctor visits alone, you may want to take someone else along to take notes. I would also recommend getting copies of all your exams and results for your own records--that will  also help if you find yourself without insurance and need to have copies to take around with you for comparisons, etc.. If it was me, I would mention the insurance issue to the doctor, BUT do let the stress of the future take over what needs to be taken care of now...I've attached a copy of a site for women with no insurance below, and also want you to know that there are other options you can address when that time comes. I am not facing the chance of a mastectomy right now--but I do know the stress it would cause me if I have to make such decisions in the future.  No matter what the doctors tell you or the decisions that may be needed for your future care, please remember that your health and well being are #1.  Your daughter needs you to be healthy so you can share in the amazing things in BOTH your futures!  Our outside bodies are only the shells that carry our souls through incredible journeys on Earth. Try to take one step at a time (easier said than done...).  When is your appointment with the BS?  Let us hear how it goes, and know that you are in my thoughts until then! Here's the site: http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/ About the Program: Through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides low-income, uninsured, and underserved women access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services.",

In summary, my GYN was very confused to see why only a piece of the whole report was followed, and why all but the cyst was overlooked by the second radiologist.  She apologized profusely for not reaching out to me before I got to her, and she noted that the surgeon disagreed with the radiologists findings as well and has scheduled an MRI.   If there is one message I want others who read this to hear, it's follow your gut feelings!  Know that there are NO stupid or insignificant questions!  We must be our own best advocate, educate ourselves, and work as a TEAM with our physicians!

I haven't actually read Dr. Love's book yet, so I can't speak to the point you saw in the book.  I do know that she has focused lots of her time and research on DCIS and the early detection of cancer--even by studying the abnormal fluid cells in the nipple, BEFORE they turn to cancer, BEFORE they even form a lump.  Many (not all) breast cancers are slow growing and can be in the breast ducts for 8-10 years before they can be found on a mammogram.  Should you be concerned about the \"seriousness\" of a lump?  I say, try and leave the stress out of the equation until diagnostic exams are done and results are found.  Remember, this is YOUR body, and doctors need to diagnose your situation WITH you, not merely acting \"upon\" you.  Don't be afraid to ask questions--especially if you get conflicting expert opinions (which was my case).  I found a BS that I am comfortable with and he acknowledges and respects my questions, concerns, and personal needs for my OWN body... If we knew all there was to know about cancer, or one procedure worked for everyone, we would be rid of cancer...Be your own best advocate--get regular exams and know your OWN body, so you know when something is not right.  Have you seen a doctor yet? Waiting for results?",

I had brown discharge and when the fluid was tested, atypical cells were found.  Those cells may never change to cancer, but we're watching to see how \"stable\" my changes are.  Blood should always be checked, and your doctor's office has test strips that show whether fluid has blood or not  (Hemastix, I think...).  When I was referred to a BS, he did a smear of the fluid and found the atypical cells. The next time the cells were tested, no atypical cells, but blood was found.  Our watch continues... Know that there is more concern when discharge is from a single breast and a single duct. There are many causes of discharge, including infection.  Sometimes a green discharge can occur from cysts. Having said that--get it all checked out.  I've attached two links to some information about discharge that I found helpful--hang in there and let us know what you hear from the doctor. http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/avon_foundation_breast_center/breast_cancers_other_conditions/nipple_discharge.html http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nipple-discharge/MY00467  I'm sending calming thoughts tonight!",

Know that our bodies go through so many changes at different ages, and you are at one of those stages (I'm heading into another stage of changes, but at the menopause end). Most of the time the changes are normal, but it's good to get them checked out all the same. There are so many things that might be going on, cancer is only one of many, but it could be something as simple as an infection or hormonal changes that are affecting your breasts.

My gut didn't let it go there and I instigated a follow up with the BS.  He walked me through things and put his head in his hands in frustration when I explained the mixed messages from everyone.  He said he wished I had called him to get it cleared up and to always do so in the future.  He feels very comfortable having me wait 6 months to recheck everything-but also assured me that he was watching things-no palpable mass but atypical cells and he doesn't like that.  He also insisted that I call him immediately if I see any changes before the six months is up. My point in telling you all this-there are doctors out there that are supportive and it is important to find one that you feel comfortable with and does not judge you as \"another crazy woman\" if you are confused with all the overwhelming information...peace  ",
