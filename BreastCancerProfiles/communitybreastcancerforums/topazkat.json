They recommended a biopsy and an MRI. They biopsied both breasts, one showed nothing unusual, the other a radial scar. According to her Dr, the radiologist removed the entire radial scar with the biopsy but due to the large size of the calcium deposit area it was recommended that she have an MRI to make sure they weren't missing something behind it. That came back clear too. The Dr had the pathologist look at the biopsy and due to the size she felt that my friend should consult with her partner, a surgeon, to discuss surgery to further check the area. I am accompanying my friend to the appointment. What further questions should we ask? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
