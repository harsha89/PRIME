I could really relate to your original post. The funny thing is I had these sort of burning shooting pains in the evening before bed a few months back and i now wonders ifits related to the new calcifications. I am sorry to hear about your positive results, I am praying for you and will be keeping track of your journey.....  Purple88",

Received a BIRADS 4B, small tightly clustered group of fine pleomorphic calcifications. Because I have implants also and the calcifications were very close to the chest wall in between the implant and chest wall I was told a wire guided excisional biopsy would be best for me. Long story short, I had the surgery and they completely missed the calcifications. The surgeon took the first chunk and when they weren't in there he went back in and took the whole auxiliary tail of my left breast on 12/19/14. Made me wait until 12/24 for results only for them to tell me that they missed them entirely. I was told I had to wait 3 months to heal enough to have another mammo to find them again. I called my referring gyno and he said it was unacceptable, he referred me to another clinic and they found the calcifications right away on a mammo on 01/21, I have a stereotactic set up for 01/29 which they are very confident that they can do. I am so frustrated and scared, this nightmare has to end, I am 47 with heterogenously dense breast tissues and no history of breast cancer...",
