      "Content": "Matzwd wrote: Hello.  I'm just curious as to what you other folks would do if in this situation.  This might be kind of long.  I'm going to start at the beginning.  Began menses at just short of 12 years old, first fine needle aspiration on a cyst at 16, first child at 19.Back in 1999 I had a breast reduction.  I am now 43 years old and began annual mammograms at 35 due to family history (lots of cancer, both parents as a matter of fact, but only a paternal grandmother with breast cancer).  Only a stable lymph node in right breast had ever been noted. Everything had been great until 2008 when I had a breast exam prior to beginning a drug study.  The doc doing the study found a lump in my left breast, then clear mammo, fine needle aspiration, determined to be just fat necrosis.  Jump ahead 2 more years to 2010 when the left breast became painful to touch, especially in the areolar area, but mostly the nipple.  This was investigated with mammo, and nothing was found.  It stayed that sensitive for about a year and a half and has still hurt to touch since then, but less so.  Then, in April 2012, I found another larger lump in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast.  Went to my regular doc, who just happens to be a surgeon who has done extensive breast research, though not a breast surgeon.  He immediately sent me for ultrasound since I had just had a mammo 5 months prior.  Radiologist was circling an area on the screen, inquiring of the ultrasound tech.  The tech announced that \"I think that's a duct,\" so the radiologist put that in the report, but she sent me immediately over for another mammo (left only).  They saw nothing, but said that my breasts are pretty good for seeing things in mammograms, but that the area where there is a problem is dense.  Moved from Birads 2 to Birads 3.  Lump is felt, but not seen.  I took it upon myself to visit a breast surgeon who said she thought it was another fat necrosis.  she fine needled it just to make sure, pulled out mostly fat and sent it off, came back fine.   I've been a nervous wreck about all this coming up, with the reduction being so long ago and learning that these things happen with trauma.  Would I still be developing this sort of thing so long afterward?  I've pretty much been obsessed with checking and watching and reading about the dead fat in my boob.  I've read that they often resolve on their own, but even that original one from 2008 is still there.  I'm freaked out about the fact the US tech made the call about the duct, and that the radiologist was not able to do so.  Almost immediately after that appointment with the BS I found two tiny bb-feeling things in different areas of my right breast and feel several smalll, tender lumps along the lower outside edge of the right breast.  I'm sure they were there when she examined me, but why didn't she mention them?  I will say that they are more difficult to feel when I'm lying down and easier upon standing, which is how I usually examine myself.  I haven't been too worried, though, about the lumps on the side of the breast, assuming they were likely fibrocystic thingies as my sister has had a gazillion of them removed from the exact same area.  I have, however, been a little bit concerned about the tiny bb things located in the fleshy part of the breast between the areola and the edge.  I can see where they may have been missed since they are really, really small, but they are hard.  I've been sitting on all this until I am do for my next exam in November.  I was thinking I'd point them out to the doc then and see what he says as I feel like they may just think I'm nuts if I keep returning.  Oh, and radiologist recommended short interval mammogram in November when I would have been due for the annual one.  I was going to try to hold off until January on the mammo since insurance will only cover one a year. As far as the duct is concerned, that could be the cause of the pain in the breast, but why do they not want to know why the duct is dilated.  I kind of want to know. Fast forward to Friday evening of last week.  Undressed for bed, removed bra, and was washing face when I noticed a stinging twinge in my left breast when my arm touched it.  That was gone the next day, so I figure maybe my bra had been displaced or something like that.  However, I just found another lump in my left breast Sunday.  It's right outside the edge of the areola in the inner upper quadrant.  It does not feel as hard as the bb ones do, but feels more what I would call tough.  Should I wait until November, as it could just be another fat necrosis, or should I make an appointment sooner?  Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I just can't shake the feeling something bad is going on, and I'm not one to fret to be honest.  Why does all this stuff keep coming up in my left breast?   Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Apr 21, 2012 03:59AM - edited Apr 21, 2012 04:05AM by Matzwd My BS pretty much diagnosed me on physical exam. I had already had the mammogram and us that didn't show anything really. Well, the ultrasound showed dense tissue in that area and a dilated duct. Interestingly, though, the radiologist and us tech were discussing things in front of me while pointing at the monitor. The radiologist was saying something about \"this area\"and pointing on the screen. The tech said, \"I think that is a duct, I think it's a duct.\" I was sent then for the mammo where they saw nothing at all. Interestingly, when I picked up the reports to take to the bs, I noticed that the us report mentioned a dilated duct, but I could tell when we were all in the room together that the radiologist really had no idea what it was, so I guess the tech diagnosed me at that point, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Anyhow, when the bs saw the reports and the films and examined me, she told me she was sure it was fat necrosis and did a fine needle biopsy for my peace of mind. I got a call 2 days later starting that everything was fine. I didn't however, actually ask for the pathology results. I'm going to have to get a copy just for curiosity's sake.",
