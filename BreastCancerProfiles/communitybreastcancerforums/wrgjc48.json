I don't have lymphedema in my arms.  I have had breast cancer for 20 years.  Can anyone tell me more about this?  Has anyone ever had it drained?  It is mild to moderate at this point.   I'm new at these discussions and how to do it.

Had a PET/CT this week and a bone scan.  Now the waiting.  My oncologist comes back from vacation next week and I have an appointment for a pathology results of the fluid, and the result of my PET and bone scan.  I'm crossing my fingers.  I've been on chemo 3 times already and have stage 4 cancer, mets to the bones in most of my body.  I knew it might come back but I don't want to do this again.  I'll let you know after the 11th.

I don't understand why fluid collects if your lymph system is not working.  Someone else wrote that it can be intertwined in your tissue and cannot be drained.  I hope that is not me.  Did you say that the fluid is inside your lungs or outside in the lung area? Please e-mail me too at my home e-mail wrgjc48@gmail.com. I could not figure out by your response how to get you at home.  There was no e-mail for you. Joan ",
