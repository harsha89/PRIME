My skin really stings today.  Runfree16, My mom just had a masectomy last week for her 2 round with BC. Her mom also had it twice. My dads sister had it once and her daughter has had it twice. I knew about my grandmother and of course my moms first round but did not know about my aunt and cousin when I was diagnoised.  I went for genetic counseling and even though I am negative for brac1 and 2 they still feel like it may be genetic. They want to run a breastnext panel but is is expensive and gives information on other cancers too. I just don't think I want all the info it gives so I have to decide if I am comfortable with my treatment so far or if I want to go for more surgery. ",

Not only tired, I seem to have just about every SE you can get. The brain fog, heart burn..and the red swollen boob and arm. I did not even try to take my karate class last night. I just wanted a pillow and blanket so I could sleep. I hate being this tired! I hate not being able to carry a conversation because I cannot remember what I was saying. Oh and the heartburn!!! I already was battling it but now it is horrible. It was comforting to know that others are having difficulties too and that I am not alone. My mind keeps going to the dark place....wondering if the cancer has spread somewhere else. I try to be strong for the kids and my husband but days like today are just overwhelming. OK..done whinning...putting my big girl panties back on and going to feed the 9 children whining about dinner!",

I am 8 days out from my last tx and doing great. Skin is tan but the rash is gone so no more itching! The area from my arm pit down to my breast is still tender and feels swollen and my arm feels slightly heavy. It is getting better though. The zingers are going away too. My energy level is back up too.",

My clinic is closed for 4 days so I get a little break then one more regular Tx then my boosts. I am red, blistered and itchy. I can handle the pain it is the itching that is driving me crazy. Emu oil seems to be working best for me for moisturizing but not much for the itching. I can't work out because sweating burns so bad! I tried covering the area with cornstarch before class but that didn't help. You know some of the side effects I didn't expect like making my reflux worse. I was getting worried until I found out that is common. My blood pressure has been running a little high too. I am hoping it goes down on its own after treatment.  I have been taking my tamoxifin for 2 months now. My only side effects from it are leg cramps that I am taking magnesium for and the first month I had what I called brain fog. It seems to have gotten better the last few weeks. I am so ready to be done with this and to get my life back! ",

Not sure if it was worth it though. My reflux has really gotten bad this week so I am wondering why gave up the soda. If I am going to have it anyway I might as well drink some diet coke and have some energy. Not sure about the headache. I hope the caffiene helped!  RMlulu thanks for the article! Nice to know there is a reason for the brain fog. Hope it gets better soon.  I had a rough morning but feel better this afternoon. I cried during the drive to treatment but was able to get it together before I went in. I think I need to find some energy. I am too busy to not have energy! ",
