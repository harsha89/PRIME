Had stage 1 invasive breast ca. left breast. IT was most horrible experience I ever had. They removed my morphine drip 12 hrs. after my surgery and sent me home one and a half days after my surgery with 4 drains as this was \"Their Protocol\" Surgeon and her pa walked out of room as I sat their crying. Next day I told her I was a human being Not a Protocol and not everyone has same pain tolerance . I Have switched surgeons.  My plastic surgeon was amazing and he did an incredible job minus a few suture lines coming out of my incision. Needed no chemo or radiation, .>but few mos. after oncologist put me on tamoxifen. Around 3 mos.ago developed incredible pain left shoulder and axillary area,only relieved by narcotics. mri did show tendonitis. Started pt 2x/week acupuncture 2x/week ,saw orthopedic surgeon was injected with cortisone did absolutely nothing but kill me when injected. Next went to neurologist who put me on muscle relaxants which did nothing!  This brings me to this forum I thought I was crazy!  So now back to plastic surgeon who sent me to surgeon who finally diagnosed me with post mastectomy syndrome. He sent me back to neurologist who put me on Lyrica 2 days ago and ordered 2 mris for tue. We shall see. Also on and off of tamoxifen per oncologist because of blood clotting issues with tendonitis. I am so sorry to go on and on but nobody understands except my ca. support group. On a happier note I am going to be a grandma for first time next week,and I want to be able to hold baby! Thank you all for listening and may your Lives be journies and not destinations.",
