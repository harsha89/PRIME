So far my hair has come back thicker (good), darker (better than grayer) and curlier (oh, well). Some days I think it's cute and some days I think it looks like a really bad perm from the 70's. For a couple of months I blew it dry and used product before and after, but the curl has gotten stronger and now it looks lumpy when I try that so I stopped. Now I just towel dry and run my fingers through it because I'm afraid if I work with it too much it will just frizz. I hope that not messing with it too much will help it stay healthy and grow faster, but I am thinking that I will wear it shorter than I did before. During chemo I wore a wig whenever I left the house but I switched to a basball cap about 8 weeks PFC. I was still at the \"fluff\" stage not real hair, but between the summer weather and the hot flashes from Tamoxifen the wig felt horrible.  As for lashes and eyebrows -- mine thinned througout chemo and finally fell out completely about 3 weeks PFC. I use a new product called Code:AI (they have a website codeai.com). It is not a prescription and it is cheaper than latisse. It helped my brows and lashes grow back quite nicely and stay in. I like the product so much that I did a before/after at their website, but I didn't receive any compensation and I don't work for them -- I was just really glad to get my brows/lashes back.",
