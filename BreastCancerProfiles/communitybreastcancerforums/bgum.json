Almost like sore little pimples--on the right side where I had lymph node involvement. My dr seemed to dismiss me about them, because they came and went. After neoadjuvant chemo, I still had 2/7 nodes involved--though they did shrink some. I'm just afraid there are still nodes in there affected. Ugh.",

They got smaller with chemo, just not all gone). But, throughout treatment, I would get sporadic red-sore nodules under my arm that would last for a few days. I'm worried cancer cells were breaking away from my nodes, causing the sore bumps. And, now, that they're just trolling around in my body looking for a place to land. I didn't have a PCR. So, I just feel like a recurrance is inevitable. :(",

Which, my doctors were pretty pleased about. But, I still had 2 nodes. They did shrink in half. But, I was hoping they'd be gone. So, now of course I'm freaked out. Sorry to take over this thread. I was just curious about your underarm lump and what I should be looking for",

It's almost the same as chemo resistant, even though the chemo shrank my 2 nodes down to 1cm (the second one was even less. . Started out at almost 2cms!!). And my tumor was basically gone. Only 10% cellularity left. My radiation onc told me my recurrence rate was about 35% (and that's what the online tools said as well). But, my med onc said more like 20%. I hate worrying myself silly. But, I'm only 33 years old and have two kids under 4.",
