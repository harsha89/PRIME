Either with an an answer or telling me how to post in the proper forum? I had a biopsy today, meaning Friday, and now it's 6 AM and I haven't slept yet and I noticed an itch & when I went to scratch it , I saw my scar for the first time, & realized I saw it because the Steri-Strips completely came off and there was a little bit of blood in the center of the Steri-Strip! They had used 4 or 5 small strips to make a cross pattern..I didn't know what to do so took a small alcohol swab and swapped around it and noticed what look like a tiny hair (maybe part of a clot? Or could be a part of gauze that got stuck in wound? Was afraid to tug on it for fear of dislodging if clot...and it's the weekend so can't reach my doctor. I couldn't find any information online on how to Steri-Strip it myself! Have Steri-Strips in my house so I just did what I thought I would do for a wound and made like a tic-tac-toe pattern and left the center exposed a tiny bit, but since they did crisscross and didn't expose I wonder what I should do? I'm afraid if I make a crisscross, if I am wrong to do this if someone lifts it up or I lift up in a few days it will rip the scab/wound..I wondered if anyone knew if there was a reason why it had to be covered completely, or since it's already been about 16 hours from the biopsy, do you think it's OK to have a small spot of it exposed? I also covered it with a small cottn pad that I ripped off the center of a Band-Aid...thinking that was the most sterile gauze I had. (feel like Mrs. Mcgyver) The bigger gauze pads placed on my breast came undone also so I just took some surgical tape and taped them the best I could so they don't fall off my breast, but I'm not really sure what the point of them or since they don't seem to be over the wound per se but the center of the breast where I guess the actual biopsy pieces were taken? Is anyone know the point of these gauze oads or if I could remove them? (and, these are NOT over the incision) Scaredof getting an infection and I'm scared that I'm doing all the wrong things\u2026 Has anyone else had their Steri-Strips come off prematurely? If anyone is out there, thank you for listening. I feel so alone and scared. If I am replying to someone's post and not posting a new topic, can you please tell me how? And my apologies. Ty.

      "Content": "Concerned2018 wrote: Why aren't women questioning physicians more? From speaking to physicians, it appears as if I am a rarity in questioning my diagnosis/next step, etc. Personally, I think that's a shame. Doctors are NOT omniscient nor omnipotent. Like any other profession - some are more skilled, more competent, more knowledgeable. Others, much less so. Some are more trustworthy than others. (NO - not every physician deserves your trust!!) Often, hard to know where a doctor falls without questioning them. Plus, I can have 3 doctors with 3 different \"opinions\" - much of medicine - and apparently, including breast cancer - consists of subjective ideas rather than objective facts. And I think that's part of my angst. So, I am new to learning about Breast Cancer - as like most people, until an illness strikes you or someone you love, you're likely to be in the dark. And I still am 98% in the dark. But I was told I had Architectural Distortion. No one can explain to me EXACTLY what this means or how one gets. No one has told me how many people with breast cancer were first diagnosed with Architectural Distortion -- that is a very important question - but I've no clue where to seek the answer. Anyone on here know? So, I am told - \"get a biopsy\". I do. 9 gauge - core tomo-assisted biopsy with 12 samples - 20 fragments analyzed by pathologist. Benign. Yay! Hooray?? Well, yes ---- but. BIG BUT - in that for those of you versed in these things or similarly diagnosed, if a radial scar (essentially the only benign finding for A/D other than prior surgery or trauma - neither of which I've had) -- then if a radial scar, the recommendation is Surgery, and at least in my case, to have an unspecified chunk taken surrounding the biopsy area just to \"ensure\" no hidden malignant cells. Question - DOESN'T EVERY WOMAN WHOSE SCANS ARE NORMAL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING \"MALIGNANT CELLS\" THAT DON'T SHOW UP ON THEIR SCAN?? WHY NOT RECOMMEND EVERY WOMAN - ONCE EVER 5-10 YEARS OR SO, GET \"SURGERY\"? Why is that any more absurd than telling women with these \"scars\" to have? Oh, because some small % of women w radial scars have malignancies? How about this theory -- you take 100 \"no sign of cancer on scans\" women -- and do surgery -- I bet a similar % of them have malignancies just as those with radial scars - yes? No? Does anyone have access to any clinical information or studies that suggest that those with a confirmed \"radial scar\" have any higher chance of having cancer than random woman? Is it the radial scar diagnosis or just the diagnosis of architectural distortion to begin with that increases a women's risk of cancer? So most important question - to reiterate, what % of women with breast cancer had first been told they had architectural distortion? Surely, someone must know that statistic? If not, why not? If no one knows, how do doctors even know that AD is a bad sign. How do we know 3-D machines aren't just picking up stuff that many women not only have now - but may have ALWAYS had -- just didn't realize due to lack of technology? Why aren't more women asking questions like these!? If I am wrong - if the \"science and stats\" ARE there supporting my doctors assertion that all women with AD should get biopsies and all women w radial scars should get surgery, where are these studies? And if you read my prior post -- why don't they just tell all women w AD to just get surgery to begin with - what in the world is the point of having a biopsy first if all \"malignant findings\" end in surgery AND all \"benign\" pathology findings end in surgery?? I realize some of you posted possible scenarios or reasons, but are they backed by science, or just conjecture? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Concerned2018 wrote: Unnecessary Biopsy after Architectural Distortion (AD)/Radial Scar Diagnosis?!! Hello, I'm very confused at the current recommendation to have a lumpectomy. It seems to me like there is a bug in the cancer testing process where I was required to take a pointless biopsy after seeing architectural distortion, and I'd like the communities' feedback on it. First, my 3-D Tomo MRI showed architectural distortion. As far as I understand, this means that there is is either (1) an explainable reason for it (trauma/surgery), (2) a radial scar, or (3) cancer. I didn't have trauma or surgery. Therefore it is a radial scar or cancer. To distinguish between the two, my Dr. recommended a biopsy. If they found cancer they would need to do a lumpectomy. They did the biopsy (20 core samples with nine gauge needle) and didn't find cancer. However, they still recommend a lumpectomy since the biopsy isn't full proof. What was the point of the biopsy in the first place if I need to get a lumpectomy regardless?! LET ME REPEAT QUESTION for EMPHASIS: What was the point of the biopsy in the first place f I need to get a lumpectomy regardless?! It's too late to help me, but I propose the following for future women in my situation: Instead of a pointless biopsy, just do the lumpectomy. After they do the lumpectomy, they can analyze the removed tissue to determine if one has cancer and if further treatment (radiation? chemo?) is necessary. The value of information is how much it changes how we act. Given the biopsy doesn't change the reccomendation of a lumpectomy, it seems pointless. I'd appreciate your feedback. I will add one small comment: the only exception I could find & not sure if this was the case for anyone in reality, but I heard that sometimes someone could have a radial scar biopsied and that that biopsy could contain the entire scar... so, it would appear in perhaps those occasions (which are even rarer than the finding of a radial scar)...that these might be the ONLY exception to why biopsy \"might\" be sufficient\u2026 But even in those cases, based on everything I've read this far, it would be suggestive that just removing the scar might still be insufficient in that don't you also want to get a small area of healthy non-scar material taken out and biopsied along with the scar itself? I don't know that a biopsy would be sufficient to achieve this. (Any surgeons out there who wish to comment?) ***Even if let's say one out of 5000 women had to undergo the lumpectomy when a biopsy may be sufficient, would this not be a better protocol than requiring the other 4999 women with radial scars to undergo unnecessary biopsy and all that accompanies that (in terms of time, worry, pain, time passed before getting a prognosis, financial, etc.) *** these numbers are hypothetical and only based on what I read regarding something like only .1 - 2 woman per thousand or one in 2500 even have a radial scar, which seems prudent to realize that it's thus even rarer for a woman to have a radial scar biopsied and to get it all in the biopsy... plus from reading this forum,it seems more women are like me and are recommended to go for surgery.
