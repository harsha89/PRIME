It is very rare so I can understand never having seen one, but they should have at least heard of them. I do have to say that following you every 6 months is the standard of care. If you find a lump yourself before the 6 months get right in. If you have no new lumps after 2 years they will start seeing you only once a year. But you should be examined by a breast surgeon for these follow up exams not a GP. I don't know what G2 on the tumor means. Can you explain that? There are new tests and measurements since I was last diagnosed in 2004. De",

But there is a wealth of information and support for you here. Next, take a breath. Have a good cry as often as needed. You are going to get through this. We are here for you. We get it. Okay, here's my advise. Start getting recommendations on surgeons and oncologists in your area that have experience with phyllodes if possible. Go ahead and make an appointment now for a time after your insurance will be active. If you wait til you have insurance they will be booked out several weeks already. You need to get in as soon as your insurance is in effect. Start writing down questions now as you think of them. Get a notebook for questions, info you find, important things about the treatment you had so far, etc. It's very handy to have it all in one place. Your tumor should have been reviewed by the hospital tumor board. That would include their recommendations for future treatment and follow up. Your mitosis rate is very high. I would want to see an oncologist and radiation doctor. Some doctors say phyllodes is not a true breast cancer. Instead it is a rare sarcoma that only occurs in breast tissue. Therefore radiation and chemo are not effective. Also, I've never heard of anyone having phyllodes in both breasts. Your diagnosis does put you at higher risks for abnormalities in the other breast, just like any other breast cancer patient. Phyllodes tumors do tend to reoccur. However, you said the surgeon got clear margins so that's a good thing. Also, I want to put your worries to rest about not having enough breast tissue left for any future lumpectomies. I was a barely A cup and still had 6 lumpectomies before finally having a mastectomy. You still have choices. Hope this was helpful for you. Please keep us informed about your treatment. Feel free to ask anything. De",

If. the surgeon didn't get at least 1cm of clear margins all the way around you're going to need a reexcision and soon. My first time lumpectomy the surgeon was certain the tumor was a fibriodoma so he didn't take wide enough margins. Long story, but the outcome was I had to have a reexcision. I'm so glad you are going to MD Anderson. You haven't been treated very kindly or competently so far. You need someone with more experience. This must be so upsetting for you. Hugs to you. De",

No less than 8 doctors agreed that it was most certainly a fibroadenoma. Guess what? All 8 of them were wrong! This was at a large teaching hospital. Nothing showed as a problem on mammogram or ultrasound. The doctors wanted to wait and watch. I insisted on a lumpectomy. Boy was the surgeon shocked when it turned out to be a malignant phyloides tumour with DCIS and LCIS all within the same lump. Nearly everyone with a phyloides tumour is initially diagnosed with a fibroadenoma. So as someone who has actually been there, I would highly recommend you at least get a needle biopsy. I wouldn't wait 6 months. Fibroadenomas and phyloides grow very large and very fast! Sorry to disagree with Melissa, but I would not trust the reponse you got on the other thread. .",
