Never thought I would look forward to a doctors appt. lol I hope the anxiety gets better soon, been there.",

In the last two months I have received a crash course on BC. My surgery is scheduled for Monday, Feb 6th. I have elected for BMX since I have two tumors in one breast and my sister has had BC. I noticed most of you have ductal, I have lobular. Mine was found during a routine mammo. Yes, I am very anxious! I have been cleaning house and laundry today to get ready for Monday and grocery shopping tomorrow. I always thought someone with BC would at least feel bad, and I don't! Wishing you all a speedy recovery! Let's beat this thing!",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2017 01:31PM bvh2305 wrote: Hi All, My surgery is now behind me! As many have written in there blogs \"things change\". My change is my diagnosis. I am now IDC and not ILC as I was told. No big deal. I did spend the first night in the hospital instead of coming home. I am allergic to several pain meds and I was doing well with the IV meds so I continued those for 24 hours. However, the pain hasn't been that bad. I have kept on top of the pain by taking the med when due and not waiting until it was real bad and trying to bring it back under control. This has worked well for me and I really don't need it at all now. A few tips I would like to share: 1. Sleeping in a recliner helps. I am a side sleeper and I can't get comfortable on my back in the bed. The 4 drains I have prevent me from rolling onto my side. I purchased a travel pillow to go around my neck (Walmart $9.97). This has really helped my neck from hurting. 2. Prepare for constipation....this was really bad and I could have prevented it. I wish I had started Colace or generic before my surgery. I sent my husband to the pharmacy last night and he bought a bottle of the magnesium drink they give you before a colonoscopy. This finally brought me relief. 3. I did not feel like visitors. My husband and I have large families and you have some that will insist they want to visit regardless of what you say. I didn't want to be rude so I had my oldest daughter send out text messages updating them on my progress and insisting I just wasn't up to talking on phone or visitors right now. We have had many drop off food, flowers etc but no one has stayed very long since they had read the text messages. I feel this helped. 4. The hospital gave me a Softee -Roo camisole. I really like this. It's very soft against the skin and kept my pajamas away from my skin. I actually ordered another one from the company and it arrived in 3 days. It has a kangaroo pouch for my drains and also two small soft \"pillows\" you can insert in the cami. I haven't used the little pillows yet but may in the future before I have my reconstruction. 5. The drains....I have four and they are a nuisance. I bought large safety pins and I pinned my drains to my pajama top on the inside. They are hidden from view and I don't have to hold them every time I get up to go the bathroom. I was given a fanny pack at the hospital and I use this to place them in while showering. My doctor has me covering the area where the drains go into the skin when I shower. I cut a quart size Baggie in half and taped on me with a waterproof medical tape. The tape my husband bought is about 1/2 inch wide and I would recommend wider to keep the area sealed from water. 6. Take an overnight bag with you and leave in the car, just in case. When they decided to keep me my husband didn't have to go home to get anything. Actually, you don't need anything but I still wanted a hairbrush and my toothbrush. I know many if you are having surgery this coming week. I think the anxiety before the surgery was much worse. I see my oncologist this week and more of my pathology results will be available. She will be able to tell me if I need chemo or rads. I wish you all the best and look forward to hearing from you after your surgeries.",
