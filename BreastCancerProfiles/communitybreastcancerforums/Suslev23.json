I\u2019ve had lung mets since the beginning (I was diagnosed stage IV to begin with, in January). If you google LC, it looks BAD. I\u2019m not sure what help I can be, other then A fellow LC patient. My doctor, seems ridiculously positive about the LC. I have asked her many times to be straight with me and she seems to be treating it like typical lung mets. I really trust her, but I am also scared of the information floating around the internet. Just finished first cycle of xeloda, breathing has yet to improve. Are you symptomatic? She\u2019s hoping to give me a couple more weeks of xeloda before we rescan. Basically LC is inflammation in the lungs caused by tumor blocking parts of bronchial tube- or so I think. What is your MO saying? I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this, but it is nice to know I\u2019m not alone.",

My genomic testing came back (7 months later) and shows that I have a mutated gene that makes me sensitive to carbo. So my MO cut out the gemzar to see if it makes it easier on me. I\u2019ve had one dose of just carbo thus far, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better or not. I am still very fatigued but I never know if maybe that\u2019s from lack of conditioning from not doing a lot. Getting a port put in Wednesday as my veins are officially shot after a year of treatment. I have not lost any hair on my head from carbo or gem!! I\u2019ve noticed my body hair has thinned majorly (don\u2019t need to shave my armpits very often!) but my head hair is perfectly in place.  Good luck! Let me know if I can answer any questions you have",

I can just tell you that I was MISERABLE on gemzar and carbo... went to carbo weekly and it\u2019s muhx more manageable.  Also as someone who is stage IV, I think if you can get through two more treatments it gives you a little more insurance!  Good luck!",
