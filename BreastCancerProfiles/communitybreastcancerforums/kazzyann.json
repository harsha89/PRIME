I have been at the hospital most of the time - it is so difficult as my brother and sister live right near her, they never really moved far from home and yet I live 55 miles away. I have been driving 2 hours there, spending 4 hours and then driving 2 hours home which I can do this week as my son is on school holidays but when he goes bk to school on  onday I just can't physically do that every day   -  I don;t have the time window. This has caused a row with my sister who lives right by the hospital and does not have any children. She is spending 12 hours a day there and seems to think that I can do the same, and as I cant I feel really really guilty. My mum told me quite a few things when my sister wasnt in the room ie how long she had felt ill etc but when my sister came back and we had a coffee I told her and she went mad that my mum had spoken to me and not her, and accused me of making things up. I really do not need this - we are all supposed to be doing the best we can but it isn't our fault that she didnt tell us. I know it sounds selfish but I just can;t see how I can look after my own family and my mum at the same time - I am already shattered after doing a 5 hour round drive yesterday to soend the day with her. I have barely seen my own son this week.",

She hadn't told anybody she had been feeling unwell and me and my brother and sister had all seen her as recently as last week and spoken on phone daily.  Hospital were baffled, undressed her and found to their horror that her right breast had completely gone - eaten away completely with what we now know to be cancer.She had had a lump years ago and never told a soul - just let the breast be eaten away. Further test reveal it has spread to her kidney, lungs, bones and brain and they cannot offer any treatment. She has weeks, maybe days to live. We are all in shock, angry she never told us, and dont know what to do. I keep hoping to wake up fromo this nightmare. Please help. Log in to post a reply",
