Because my tumor was 5cm they decided to do chemo first to shrink it. I was on Carboplatin,Taxotere and Herceptin. My SE was not as bad as expected but I did get tired and a little nausea. Also by the 5th day my taste buds were screwed. I am still on Herceptin till February and am taking Tamoxifen. I started Tamoxifen in July and have a few side effects. I get headaches and my legs hurt like I walked all day. I didnt have a period when I started chemo but did finally get one in October and have gotten one monthy since. I hope everything goes smoothly for her. Take it one day at a time.  ",

I will be getting a total of 6 treatments once every 3 weeks. My Dr felt it would be better to do chemo first before surgery to shrink the tumor which is 5cm. So far I have had only one treatment and was wondering if anyone knew how soon after or when would I notice that it was shrinking?

I went to my follow up on Monday and was then told that I am HER- after some further testing had been done.. They are now going to put me on AC for 4 treatments followed by 12 weekly treatments of taxol. I was wondering if anyone else with a similar diagnosis was on this same chemo meds?
