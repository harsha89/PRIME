Initially I wasn't sure if I fit in on this site either, but I have found nothing but wonderful and understanding women.  We are all afraid of the same kinds of things, regardless of our risk or stage.  Now I feel very at home and I hope you will, too.  Welcome and hugs! Mar, so sorry you are having a stressed day.  I got a lecture today from a relative, telling me that I think I am always strong and independent....but, I should ASK for help in this situation.  When people offer, I think they truly mean they will help with anything.  Whether it is a meal, a load of laundry, taking the garbage out, running to the store, please get a list of friends together and don't be afraid to call.  The most important thing you can do for yourself is to take the help and let yourself heal. It is going to take some time.  Hugs to all the Dec 2010 ladies! ",

Julia, I'm not very patient at being a patient either.  Sooo tired of sitting in this recliner. But after this long journey, I don't want to risk any complications with the flaps or diep incision. Elizabeth27, my insurance covered a couple home health care visits.  The nurse assessed the situation, watched my husband do the drains and discharged me.  I didn't think it was worth it.   Tammy, it sounds like you are doing fantastic in your recovery!  If you get info on the arm exercises, let us know....My numb forearm is driving me a bit crazy and I haven't got PT prescribed yet.  Gigi, it is so funny that you stumped your doctor with the Scuba question.  I hope you get a good answer, but it is better safe than sorry and wise of you to ask.  Andreas, congrats on getting through and getting home.  Happy healing and hugs!  Cathy, what did you pay you doctor to get him to tell your husband no chores for 2 years??  LOL  Sound like you are doing great and I hope your drains slow down for removal soon. Carolyn, how are those blisters?  Does it still seem like it is from the tape?  Hope they can help when you call the doc today. Carla, running in a couple weeks?  You go girl!  I'll be lucky if I can do a fast walk!  ArleneMarie, you make sure you don't overdo it on the upcoming move!  I can't imagine you recovering and moving at the same time...best of luck and let others do the work. Ilene, so glad to see you have joined the \"recliner brigade\".  We look forward to hearing your progress when it is easier to get online.  I know how tough it was for me at first.    Hugs to all my dear ladies on this thread....be well.

I can't do NSM due to my 38D size....but I trust my doctor to make them look good.  Here's a little of my background... My journey began in May, with calcifications and stereostatic biopsy.  Diagnosis was ALH and plan of action just watch and wait (or that and Tamoxifen).  I picture myself every 6 months stressing for 4 weeks before and a week after.  I think in the long run, that will be more stress over a lifetime than going through the pbmx and being able to get on with life. Unfortunately, I do have family history.  My aunt died at 47 and her two daughters both have BC.  One is on chemo now, the other discovered a lump, nothing showed up on mammo, a couple months later the lump got painful, they found invasive cancer, immediate mx , rads, chemo, and she spent the next 20 months, the remainder of her life, fighting it.  She died at age 45.  I never gave my family history much concern as it was on my Dad's side of the family.  After my ALH diagnosis, I couldn't stop thinking that I did not want to \"watch and wait\" for the shoe to drop.   Personally, I know this is the only option that will give me the most peace of mind. I have three teenagers, which can be a blessing and a curse (depending on the day) no really, I live for them.  A great DH that is supporting my every decision, and my mom (83) that lives nearby.  I'm just getting more nervous with only 2 weeks to go. What a great place this is to share and grab some calm.... Hugs to all my new friends, Jane ",

Back to packing, Hugs ladies ",

Yay!  I really wasn't expecting that many, as my PS needs to fix some skin necrosis and I figured he would leave those in until surgery next week.  It was great to get out of the house, but shortly after I got home, I was ready for a nap.  Elizabeth27, my situation is different, but I would wear the most comfortable thing you have.  The sleep cap sounds perfect.  From what I remember, I'm sure I didn't really care what I looked like after surgery and neither did any of the staff nor my family. You are beautiful the way you are.  Ilene, now it is truly time to \"takeadeepbreath\".  Try to smile and know I will be praying for you and your doctors tomorrow. Laurie, I'm guessing you have made it to NOLA by now.  Is cajun food too spicy for the night before surgery?  I love cajun cooking. Sending good karma your way for tomorrow. Carolyn, you are very brave to drive yourself in tomorrow.  I hope you will get sleep tonight.  And I will be thinking of you tomorrow... especially if I am awake at 5 am.  Hugs ladies, Jane ",

Mar (Pink13) Know that I (and the gals on this site) will be here for you to talk and give support.  It must be hard missing your husband and having your kids be kind of distant.  Sending you a great big hug! Megan-fire I asked the nurse about the recliner today.  She said it is a good idea if you have one.  We are going to borrow one from my mom.  Now all I have to do is find room in my bedroom.  Ahh juggling funiture...I hate that....it always seems to touch more than one room. Sharon Two Mx's in one year?  Wow, I bet you will be glad when 2011 shows up!  You are a real trooper.  The idea to start a journal is brilliant!  I have one that I started and kind of forgot about.  I think it was a gratitude journal...with all the difficulties we are going through, gratitude is a good perspective to keep. Laurie,  I specifically asked my BS about my risk post surgery.  I'm sure it's not the same for all cases, but he gave me about 1%.  Compared to my 40% now.  That is one of the things that helped me decide to go ahead with the pbmx.   GiGi, you can always bring back shells from the beach for stocking stuffers!  Hugs all the way around! ",

But, so many women use the recliner, and I have never heard getting in/out mentioned either.  Maybe leg muscles help with the un-recline? Now I'm curious.... Hi citykitty and welcome to the December group! I can so relate to you needing to do research...I am the research queen.  I probably know too much at this point and am scared to be going through this as well.  After researching the internet to death, I find myself on this website all the time.  I made the decision in Sept. to get a prophylactic BMx and have been waiting since then to get a time with my surgeons.  At the end of the day, I do know that this decision will give me the greatest chance at \"peace of mind\", which in my book, is priceless. Gigi welcome home!  Hope you soaked up the sun and got some relaxation.  It seems even if I'm doing nothing now, it's hard to relax.  I guess busy is better, which is not bad, given the list of things I still have to do! Tina thanks for honoring us with your first post! I hope you feel warm and welcome... you are in very good company with all of these brave and beautiful ladies.  You are officially in charge of keeping us all laughing!  What a great attitude. ",

Sending hugs sammolisa, thanks for the tips, I guess we will need help, it is so hard to picture being that helpless.  I can't wait to get this over, but I do realize that is when the work (of healing) starts.  So, I had my first pre surgery dream last night. My abdomen incision came unglued and I couldn't get ahold of my doctor (or my dentist, lol, as if he could help). Does that fall in the nightmare category?   I am hoping to get one last trip to Costco in today for stocking up.  I know it will be a while before I can tackle that again.  Hugs to all of you, Jane ",

Doing the Happy Dance very slowly with no flailing arms.  Path report came back all negative.  My right forearm has been numb since surgery.  I don't know if it was placement of my arms during the long procedure or the lymph node they took.  I had SO many IV's that had to be tried, (tried again then call the IV team who sometimes had to also try twice) placed, changed. At least 12 IV pokes I can count.  Maybe the total count is in the journal my friend/husband started.  Not to mention heparin injections in the thigh every 8 hours. Then my blood sugar was a little up just after surgery.  I'm not diabetic, but then they insisted on poking me 4 times a day for blood sugar and even gave me a couple insulin shots.  I have bruises all over me and am glad to not be getting poked anymore.  The morning of day 5 after surgery, I was hoping to get the ok to come home and the IV in my numb arm got so painful, they thought I might be having a heart attack.  Just Great! Out comes the EKG and blood work (another poke) for MI enzymes. I have a couple small areas that are purple where the BS probably scraped too close to the skin and will have to have some minor skin grafting done.  Another surgery, very soon, dread that.  But, swelling is down a bit and I'm online.  Anniemomofthree, Good luck with the SNB tomorrow. Annie62, you are so lucky to escape the pain meds.  I'm hating the oxycodone. BikerBabe, dfwgal, I've added you to the list no one wants to be on.  But we want you here with us, WELCOME! Did I miss anyone else?  Send a reminder if I did. Hugs, Mar, Ilene, Megan, and all my other December sisters,",

Hugs to all, Jane ",

Sending you big hugs ",
