My neurooathy in my feet progressively worsened post chemo. 18 months later I suddenly could not move my ankles and was hospitalized w/suspected Guillien Barre Syndrome or MS. After several months and several new neurologist I was wearing leg braces and had trouble walking . A new group of neurolgist then said it was related to effects of chemo- specifically Taxol. I had to quit my nursing job and retire early at age 60. I wore leg braces for 5 years. Finally about a year ago my leg felt stronger deslite foot drop and continuing neuropathy. I can now walk w/out a cane even, rather slower than I would like but happy that I can do some gardening and get around more. Still have not been able to ride a bike like I used to for years. I am blessed to have two beautiful grandchildren who visit a lot and keep me active. I occasionally use a pain pill when my feet get bad at night but have learned to live w/it. There are various meds that are supposed to help neuropathy but none worked for me.Going in tbe swimming pool was best therapy, taking the weight off the legs. I am also taking Amitryptyline at bedtime for restless leg syndrome. It helps some. So please go see a neurologist and explore treatments.My prayers that it will clear up for you very soon. Hugs Rene",

Most women gain some weight during chemo not lose as I had thought. Steroids can also temporarily increase your blood sugar. Used for daily longer than a few weeks they can cause cataracts ( which I now have ) and cause a temporary pimply looking rash ( only on some people- mine was all over my back ) and large amount of weight gain ( 20 lbs for me but I lost most it w/much work  ) and mood swinges. The very short time you take them for chemo will likely not give you long term effcts. But best to talk to your Onc to be sure. Hugs going out to you.",

I am about to start on Xeloda as all the hormone blockers failed in my case.  The RADS last year appear to have damaged the right lung to boot and new lesions seen in left one along w/ some chest wall and back questionable areas. I have had walking issues for 6 years as a result from the Taxol chemo I had 2006. Bone spurs can happen even in non cancer situations,  injectable steriods often used. However they would not use that I doubt in a ca patient as it could cause  further spread. They should do an MRI maybe to rule out bone mets in the hips. Yes, you are right that most insurance will not cover electric scooter unless it is needed to get around inside the home, I could only get a push W/C .  Walgreens and some onlines sell them for around $500-$600. You may find a used one online  or paper classifieds.   Ask to s/w the social worker w/your Onc  too as they may be able to direct you to some help w/funding. I am checking on this too as I suspect the new chemo drug will make my walking get worse.  Big hug. Rene",

The morning of surgery for the mastectomy I was sent down to radiology. I lay for an hour undressed while I waited to get these \" dye  injections \" .  I had no idea what for and it hurt like hell. My surgeon had told me he doubted I would need ANY nodes removed. Not sure if they still do it that way but cells were sent down to pathology while I was still on the op table.. It was over 5 hours. My poor fiancé was the last person still in the post op waiting room at the end of the day. Turned out a bunch of nodes removed and only the sentinel one was positive. The cyst on the other breast was also there back then and they assured me it was only a cyst.  I am not really looking forward to another mammo this year. ",

Now my goal is to get well enough to be able to travel and then that will be one regret I will not have anymore. I think God has his plan for us all mapped when we are born so everything happens for a reason.

I have already been thru BC treatment for right breast several years ago. I freaked out when the doctor doing the needle biopsy said I had to have the titanium marker inserted. They almost refused to do it as I told them I did want any metal left inside me. ( I am also very allergic and past 7 years one thing after) This left side had always been described as a \" cyst\". Anyway she agreed to remove the fluid and if it looked clear would not send it to the lab and NOT place a marker, Which is what she did. I was mostly concerned about irritation -inflammation a metal tip could react inside my breast. I am a retired RN and my experience w/titanium was it is the strongest metal there is. I am still bothered that she never sent the fluid off for pathology. Your marker should be viewable on xray and they could remove it. Question would be who would do it and who would pay for it. Could be done but costly. I might add that I have several surgical clips in my chest and under arm from my mastectomy that almost got identified as ca spread.",

Shingles is one if the most painful conditions even when you are not on chemo. As a nurse I saw transplant patients who got it. Antiviral meds help to clear it but the pain can remain weeks after the rash is gone. Please ask for enough pain meds to get you through. Steroids do lesson inflammation but also increase risk of cancer cells multiplying so they are used very sparingly during chemo. The shingles vaccine has supposedly 14 times higher amount of live virus than the chicken pox vaccine that children get so I am undecided as to if I get it or not. The old soothing comfort for chicken pox is bathing in cornstarch and oatmeal bath. Perhaps an evening head wrap ( just a thought- messy I know ) Hugs. Rene   ",
