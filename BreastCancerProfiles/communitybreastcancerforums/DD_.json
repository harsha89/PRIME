Had a great outpouring of it. She tried to log back on and the Mods had blocked her account. Sadly, this is only another banning in a midst of many! I know that most women on this message forum did not participate in the political threads, but I know that many of you would read the threads.  More importantly, many of the women and one man who did post, on the Republican thread particularly, had friends all over this forum. The reason for this message is to let everyone know that the moderators here at bc.org have banned most of the users who posted on the republican thread.  The bans varied from 2 weeks to lifetime.  In all there were 9 women and 1 man who were banned.  The ONLY \"common\" link was that they were regular posters on the republican political thread.  I was an avid reader of that thread and an occasional reader of the democrat thread, but I only posted a very few times between the two of them.  But I knew these women from other topics here.  The gentleman who was lifetime banned, has a wife with IBC.  He relied so heavily on the wonderful women here to help him deal with all life has thrown at the two of them.  Perhaps more importantly, he HELPED many women here, particularly in the IBC forum. Many of the women who were banned were also loyal posters in the METS forum because they too have metastatic breast cancer.  Thanks to censorship here, they can no longer grow friendships or supporting those who are newly diagnosed. The travesty is the bans that occurred, were limited to the users who were supporters of the republican party, even though none of the forum rules were ever broken.  The ladies who were regulars on the democrat thread continue to post.  Even though both threads were completely removed from this forum, it was painfully obvious that only the republican voices were forcefully silenced here.  It is a very sad day, when freedom of speech, is taken away on a breast cancer support forum. There were many breast cancer survivors, who relied on the political forum to take them out of the world of breast cancer, if only for a while.  It was very therapeutic for them to be able to escape the reality of this horrible disease. All who were banned, emailed the moderators requesting an explanation, but the e-mails have gone unanswered.  Meanwhile, the bans continue, and survivors are turned away. So I suppose if you are a supporter of the democratic party, you are protected, but if you differ from their beliefs, then you are banned. It is a blatant display of censorship, and bc.org must understand that we breast cancer survivors won't stand for this.  I am not suggesting that everyone post complaints, or send e-mails, I am suggesting that breast cancer survivors of all political parties take a stand and let the moderators here know that it is NOT okay to pick a political side and ban those who disagree with it. This is no longer about party affiliation; this is about violating individuals' right to freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.  All breast cancer survivors should be offended by the actions taken by bc.org.  All are invited to join a great new breast cancer message forum, full of women who are survivors of both breast cancer and censorship!  Please visit http://www.breastcanswers.com/index.htlm .  Enjoy all the invaluable information about breast cancer there, and follow the link to the message forum where you can reunite with some loyal friends.",
