It is good to have you with us...even though none of us wishes we had to be here. I have my infusions on Fridays as well and will be praying for you and thinking of you this week as you get started. Lisbeth - Wow! That PA was horrible! Pretty sure I could not have been patient with her (no pun intended). Did she ever answer all your questions? I had a less offensive but similar experience with the BS who did my two lumpectomies early this year. I went to her because she was the most skilled doc in the local region, and I did like her. Some things she said to me really never set right with me. In the end, I had my BMX at another facility (with the doc who'd done my 2nd opinion). That turned out to be the best choice I made in this ordeal. Looking back, I wish I'd have made the choice sooner. No regrets. But definitely a lesson learned. I forget if you mentioned your former line of work, but it was obviously in the medical field. I spent my 20s working in a hospital and medical office. One of my jobs was in an OR. With the surgeries I've had in the past year, I always make sure to get to know my circulating nurse and thank her ahead of time for correctly counting all the sponges that go in and out of my incisions. I thank the nurse anesthetist as well and let her (or him) know that I'm aware that she is one of the most valuable parts of my team. I usually throw in that she is the one running my show...not the anesthesiologist. Dara - Glad you had a good time with the grands and that your family is so very supportive. I don't have kids, so I just borrow other people's kids to love on. Well today is the first day of school in the district where I work. Going to don my spiky hair style and make the kids think I'm cool. I have my station all set up with masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, alcohol wipes, etc. My MO says, \"think hand sanitizer constantly\". I've already begun that pattern at work and home. The secretary in the building where I'm based has set up the office bathroom to be user friendly for me...paper towels where I don't have to crank the dispenser. She's also Lysol spraying all the door knobs for me. Love the support and the kind gestures. Now to keep all those little walking germs at bay. Since I work in the technology department and all our kiddos have devices (iPads or laptops), I end up handling lots of things they've touched. So I'm going to make my #1 job avoiding illness. Here goes... Wishing all of you a blessed day filled with everything good. Love you all!",

Glad to see you were able to smile for your pic. For those who are my sisters in experiencing \"bottom problems\"...I feel your pain. *sigh* Heading off to a busy day at work. Sending love to all.

I understand your apprehension about your hair. I was in the process of growing mine back out when I got the diagnosis. Went for a short cut and ordered some hats and scarves. Am thinking I may want to shave it off before it can fall out. While I think I could deal with gradual thinning, I'm not sure what my emotional reaction would be if a huge clump came out. Yes, I've got the hats on hand...but there's still that initial shock. If I shave it now, I kind of feel like I'm taking control of the situation. Told my husband I was going to get that mohawk I'd always joked about. All that to say, hang in there. You are definitely not alone. Please post later today and let us all know how day 1 went.

Can't help but wonder sometimes, though. adawn24 - I work in a public school setting and my MO has said it's okay to work too. My job is in our tech dept and I get into all of our buildings. My biggest concern is in our elementary schools where everyone is a walking collection of germs. I am going to keep a stash of gloves, masks, hand sanitizer, and Lysol wipes with me at all times. Also thinking that I may shave my head before the school year begins so I can start off wearing my hats and scarves when the kids come back...make it less of an issue...it will just be the way it is. Noticing you and I had our surgeries around the same time as well. Good to find a twin on here to exchange stories! WenchLori - Glad you can have some time for yourself. Hoping you can fill most of it with things you enjoy and very little thought of BC. UnwillingParticipant - I LOVE your attitude. You seem to be staying on top of things and so determined. I'm also awed by your creativity. I don't have a \"crafty\" bone in my body. Wonder if they could infuse some of that? At my chemo counseling yesterday the nurse said I needed to avoid raw meat & buffets. Since chemo starts on Friday, I told hubby I want to go out for a huge medium rare steak tonight and hit a buffet line for my \"last supper.\" Guess I'm making it obvious that I just don't like to be told what I can and can't do.",

Taxol/Herceptin #2 this morning. My bags are packed and all I need is some coffee and my shower. Unwilling - Envisioning walking in to the infusion center wrapped as a plastic mummy and numb from the neck down. Oh, how you made me laugh. My hubby looked at me quizzically when I very literally laughed out loud reading that part of your 8/14 post. When he asked what I was laughing at I told him, \"breast cancer.\" I really cherish how we can all rally together and both laugh and cry about our issues. Don't know what I'd do without all you ladies. I see you have made some tough decisions about treatment. I am so sorry you have had to struggle with that but glad you have chosen a path that you feel peace about. Will be keeping you in prayer. Wishing you a 50th anniversary that is more wonderful that you could ever imagine. Kenzielulu - Good thought to sleep propped up. I've been battling seasonal sinus issues as well. Will have to keep that in mind. Embrace being 49 and bald, Kenzielulu. Yesterday I decided that a 52 year old can rock a mohawk. My stylist offered to come to the house, but I decided that BC was NOT going to make me whither away in my home afraid of what I look like or what others think. So I went to the salon and actually had a great time with the ladies there offering their opinion as we did the cut in phases. Some man did come in for a haircut and I think he felt uncomfortable as we all talked openly. In spite of the fact that I thought I'd have an emotional breakdown losing my hair, this was okay. A way for me to take control of the situation that I've got no control over. I admit that I worried that I'd look in the mirror and feel like an idiot, so I took a doo rag along. When I left, though, I walked out with my head held high (and my hair peaked higher). Let anyone ask and they would hear the truth. Let anyone laugh and I'd offer to show my BMX scars. Sometimes you just have to be a badass. Came home to this huge, heavy box on my dining room table. A dear friend who is struggling with her own issues and doesn't have the money for it sent me this AMAZING box of goodies. A few snacks, but mostly other things to occupy my mind and make the process easier. Every last item was so well thought out and totally practical for a chemo patient. The best part were the things she made - a beanie in cat fabric, a bright and cheery head wrap, a soft cushion to cover the seatbelt and protect my port, and a \"grouchy day\" bag I can use to carry items to infusion. I felt so humbled and loved that I just broke down in tears. It's one thing for people to be nice, but when someone who has not been in your shoes really GETS IT and shows it\u2026it totally blows me away. Welcome Mydogspot! Just want to encourage you to get a second opinion if you're unsure about what your MO is recommending. Trying to research it on your own is mind boggling. It can never hurt to get a different professional perspective. Falabella - We're glad to have you with on this thread no matter when you start your infusions. Please keep posting. We're like family now. Sending hugs and praying your infection resolves sooner than later. Hopefloats - My port was sheer hell for about 7-10 days. I wanted to rip it right out so many times. But it's now been 2 weeks and I hardly notice it's there. Hang in there\u2026it does get better. Pinkjellyrollz - Welcome to the sisterhood! I love that analogy. I, too, love learning from all the ladies here. Okay\u2026I still haven't caught up on all your posts. But if I don't shower they may hose me down at the infusion center. Will catch up while I'm spacing out on my Benadryl. LOVE YOU ALL!",

Thanks for the good wishes for the start of the school year. I think you asked me previously what grade level I worked with. I started at the middle school 21 + years ago as an aide in the learning support classroom. Gradually my position became more tech-centered, and I officially became part of our district's tech department last June. I split my day between our middle school and two elementaries and also back up my colleague who services the high school. I never thought I'd be changing careers at 50, but our 20-something hardware specialist took me under his wing over a few summers when I worked as extra help and the rest is history. With the elementary kiddos I am mostly handling their devices and am able to limit my direct contact with them if needed. I have become a hand sanitizer addict and keep a stock of gloves, masks, Lysol wipes, and alcohol wipes on hand. The staff at all the buildings know what I'm going through and they all have my back. Our middle school secretary is making a regular practice of sanitizing the door knobs I touch frequently. Can't say enough about the amazing support I have felt from everyone. Saw a little kindergarten boy with a mohawk today and gave him a wink and a thumbs up. He just smiled. Of course maybe that's because he was happy that it was dismissal. ajbclan - I know what you mean about the mind game. Every little ache or throat tickle I have I find myself trying to decide if it's the start of some SE. Kechla - Sorry to hear today's infusion was cancelled, but I think you will be glad to have the PICC line in the long run. Will be praying for you tomorrow. Leydi - Welcome to this thread! Hopefloats did a great job of answering your questions already. Well, tomorrow is my first afternoon infusion. I'll be working in the morning and then leaving right before lunch for the cancer center. It's nice not to lose a full day of work. Just hope I remember to pack my lidocaine cream and saran wrap.

Thanks to everyone for the constant reminder to stay hydrated. It can be hard when the work day gets busy to think about it and then even harder at home when I just want to crash. I guzzled a quart too late last night and bolted up wide awake to pee in what I thought was the middle of the night. Made the mistake of looking at the time. 11:35???? My mind started racing and I dreaded the possibility of not getting back to sleep. So thankful I did. *wipes brow* Dara - Your reaction sounds frightening. Glad you told the nurse right away. Congrats on being 50% through this process. Kechla - I'm sensitive to adhesive too. The nurses usually bandage my port area after treatment. I told them to put NO BANDAIDS on my records as those are worst for me. I can handle the paper or silk tape much better. But what have I gotten after 2 out of my 3 infusions so far? You guessed it! Last week it was on so fast I didn't have time to complain. Ripped it off as soon as I got home - yeah, that felt great too. Sorry you have anxiety about your Picc line. Maybe the positive is that it makes you be extra careful with it??? Hopefloats - Sending lots of love your way. I will be praying for you. Lisbeth - You did say \"yay\" to chemo. Amazing what BC makes us say and think, isn't it? It's great that you got an awesome PA this time. Will you be able to avoid the cranky, rude one in the future? Sure hope so! I laughed out loud about your hubby. Why do DHs and kids do stuff like that? I made it very clear to my DH that the SECOND he THINKS of sneezing, coughing, or anything like that he is relegated to sleeping in the basement until he's better or my treatment is over...whichever comes first. And he is totally tired of hearing me ask, \"did you wash your hands\" before he touches anything I might come in contact with. Perhaps you could leave masks conveniently placed around the house so your DH would get the hint. Mine usually requires the direct approach. Wishing all my August chemo sisters a Terrific Tuesday. You are all in my thoughts and prayers daily.",

Just have to tweak it to use on adults. This past week, while making excuses for not being able to use the technology in his classroom (that he's had training on and access to for 3 years), a teacher boo-hooed about how tough it is, chuckled at me and said with a sigh, \"You don't know.\" I cocked my head, made direct eye contact and said, \"No. YOU don't know,\" then walked away. What I wanted to say was \"Hmm...let's see. Diagnosed with a brain tumor last spring. Summer of deciding what to do. Meanwhile, problems found on a mammo and needle local bx, then a craniotomy (which could have resulted in a trach and/or feeding tube) and 7 weeks out of work, meeting with breast surgeon the day I go back to work to hear I need a lumpectomy. 2 lumpectomies, a BMX with TEs, invasive BC dx, and 3 of 12+ chemo treatments later...I THINK I KNOW!!!\" Okay, all, thanks for letting me rant. Dara - Ugh to your bone pain! I know my ughing doesn't resolve it, but hope you know that I (all of us) hate that you're going through it. Your DH had that creative idea to hot glue your hair back on...what does he suggest for the bone pain? Has he got a drill? Sorry that your grandson isn't getting the support he deserves. I know that educators are human, but it's that teacher's JOB to find the good in the little guy. Your DD is doing a commendable job of making sure he gets what he needs. I spoke too soon about being 1/3 of the way through the Taxol. Felt really tired after work yesterday and took my now ritualistic nap. Had a headache too, so went to bed taking an ES Tylenol. Woke feeling just not right. Still had the headache and that sensation I get when my body is trying to fight something off. The entire drive to the center I was feeling light headed and generally icky (great vocab word for someone 20+ years in education). Went for my blood draw and then had an appointment with the PA. My BP was high for me and I told her how I felt. We decided it was best to hold off on infusion for this week so that my body could work on dealing with whatever this is. Picked up a Z-Pack on the way home (told to start it if I feel worse this weekend). Took a Tylenol and Claritin and zonked out in bed for a 2 hour nap. I'm hydrating like it's my job. I want to go to a college football game tonight. Have my mask and other protective gear and meds packed. Feeling better but undecided. Before BC I'd have toughed it out. This darn disease. Grrrr!!! Off for some more rest before I have to make up my mind. Love to all!",

Just keep reminding yourself that it's the best thing for both of you right now. No Labor Day picnic here, but the weather is lovely, so an evening walk is on store after I cut DH's hair.

But my MO advised that if I were a regular flosser and used a very soft floss I could continue. Only to stop if I noticed bleeding as that could be a route for infection. Also, the Taxol in my infusion can inhibit one's clotting factor, so there is a risk for bleeding. The hygienist at my dental office hooked me up with some gentle gum care woven floss, and I bought a bunch on Amazon. I have used that 2x daily and am VERY cautious near the gum line. I have some gaps that are food collection spots, and I think if I could not floss it would be a mouth care disaster. That said, you should definitely check with you MO. Every person and every chemo protocol is unique. Thanks to all for sharing about your medical alert bracelets. I want to find one that is pretty but also doesn't get ignored by medical personnel as just a piece of jewelry. It wasn't until my node biopsy that I noticed how often I DON'T get asked if I have a preferred arm for BP. Yikes! I've considered (not seriously, but thought about it) a huge tattoo with an alert not to use that arm.",

Do you all find that some people seem compelled to tell you about all the folks they know who have a terminal CA diagnosis and have been given a short life expectancy from their docs? I had that happen to me this week. It was already one of those moments when I was feeling kind of emotional and overwhelmed. And a coworker decided I just had to hear about this person that I don't even know and about how horrible the situation is. Believe me, I have total compassion for the person. But talk about adding insult to injury. I wonder if it's worth telling my coworker that it's probably not a good idea to do that to someone who's dealing with her own diagnosis and treatment. I know she meant no harm. She was desperately trying to find a way to let me know that she care and feels heartbroken for me. I appreciate that. I also know that wherever I turn there is a story of someone with CA. It's inescapable. I'm no Pollyanna, but I also don't want to be doom and gloom all the time either. Am I just being too sensitive?",

Welcome Tishabe, Wonderwoman, Sweetrain, & seq24 - Sorry you have to join us, but this is an awesome group of ladies. Good thing we're running out of days in August because this group has grown by leaps and bounds since I first joined. Of course all are welcome. Just wishing none of us had to be here. CandyHB - I hope your son will take a good long look at all you are going through and decide to quit smoking. That would be a wonderful thing to come out of this difficult time for you. Kenzielulu - Great to hear from you again. Sorry about all the SEs.The spray bottle is a great idea. I took stock in flushable moist wipes before this all began in anticipation of any diarrhea. I have been dealing with the opposite, but the moist wipes are a Godsend for that as well. Being sore there for any reason is never fun. You are not alone in having irrational thoughts at times. I'm pretty sure we all do. Every little ache or pain is now suspect in my book. Things I'd have never even thought about before can cause alarm. Caligirl - So far none of us have found the fun in laundry. Guess we can all stop looking. Lisbeth - That sucks that you had to reschedule your chemo, but I am glad you stood your ground and demanded answers. There is no way that medical professionals should treat us with less than total respect. We deserve things explained to us clearly so that we understand and can make informed choices. Sadly, sometimes we have to take control and advocate for ourselves. It should be easier than it is. It's good you and your family can have your boob jokes. Humor lightens the mood for me as well. You are right that the dog could mistake your boob for a toy. I tell people I chose reconstruction over a prosthesis because I didn't want to always be cleaning the cat hair off my boobs. Kaceyr - Oh dear! Wish I could do something to help you and that you felt better. I don't know what regimen you are on, but some are definitely tougher than others. I'm guessing you are getting infusions every 2 or 3 weeks? Since you now know how ill you feel, is it possible to arrange for someone to stay with you next round? Even if it's just for a few hours each day to check on you and help you out. Lisbeth is right that you should call the doctor on call any time you are having bad SEs. Most women have a tendency to just grin and bear things - DON'T. I know you are in a tough spot because of not having the pain meds, but you need to reach out. Do they have any kind of services where you get your infusions where someone can help you wade through all that insurance stuff? The cancer center I go to has a financial counselor who is there to work with patients who are having issues in that area. It can't hurt to ask. seq24 - I do my infusions on Fridays so that I have the weekend to rest up for work. My current regimen is weekly (Taxol for 12 weeks), and I am managing. Even though I tend to feel pretty good on a Saturday, I try to keep things light on the weekends so my body can get rest. I drive myself to and from my infusions, but I always have someone on call in case I don't feel up to it. The biggest culprit for that is the Benedryl I get as a premed. It tends to make me loopy, not tired. The first week it was pretty intense, but the nurses adjusted it so that I get the Benedryl over a 1/2 hour rather than 15 mins, and that has resolved the overwhelming \"stoned\" feeling for me. You will definitely need someone to take you there and home the first time as you have no idea how your body will react. Another thing I would advise since you will be around kids is to take every precaution to avoid getting sick. I work in a school setting and have stocked up on hand sanitizer, gloves, masks, and lysol wipes. You'll want to be really open with the parents and kids and let them know you have to be careful. I told the students I work with most that if they even think they feel sick I would give them a mask to wear. As my MO told me, \"think sanitizer, sanitizer, sanitizer.\" I keep a pump of it in the car, at my desk, in my work bag... You get the picture.",

Egads! If I have cumulative constipation I might as well just mix some cement and patch myself closed. Speaking of... the MO said I could use senna, but that senna-s would be better. The senna-s has more of a softener than just the senna. I had brain surgery last fall (hey, I was pretty impressed they said I had a brain), and was by no means allowed to strain. They set me up with senna and Miralax. Ugh! All that did was bloat me and make me feel crappy (pun intended). I have an herbal supplement I've used over the years, and that did the trick that the other two meds never did. So when the constipation started again with chemo, I started with the senna. Same lack of results (only now the bloating was accompanied by his BFF rectal pressure). Checked with the MO, and she said the herbal was okay. Now I'm feeling fine. But I anticipate having to use it periodically to steer clear of issues. It's called Cleanse More.

Some people thought I was crazy because it was less than 4 weeks post op and because it was my birthday. But there was no place else I wanted to be (since the beach is not an option right now). It felt wonderful to have a somewhat normal schedule and be busy focusing on things other than my diagnosis. Saw a nurse today for chemo counseling. I was really following what she was saying, but tonight I'm glad she gave me lots to read because it all feels like a blur. Decided that I won't re-hash all the \"what to do\" for SEs info. Planning to take that along to my first infusion and read then. Got a tour of the little infusion \"room\". TV, internet access, nice chair, desk... Was told that if I felt up to it I was welcome to tote my machine along and walk in the main hallway or visit a family room they have with puzzles and other amenities. Hoping I feel well enough to walk some because I am NOT good at sitting still for long. Have some bloodwork and see the MO tomorrow morning. Then one day without appointments and chemo begins Friday. Guess that means my low day may be Monday or Tuesday. Ugh! Wish you could pick your low day. I'd go with Sunday and sleep all day. The nurse today was not familiar with the pickle juice to use during flushing, but I'm going to have my little mini shots with me and be ready to go. Asked about the Neulasta, but they said they would not start me on that unless/until the determined that I definitely needed that. Anyone else told that?

If I stayed home one more day and found myself shopping online for hats or reading anything related to BC I was going to explode.

Karey59 - I don't know your chemo regimen, but some of the drugs have blood thinning properties. I know Taxol does. One thing my MO reminded me is that the pharma companies will list all possible SEs. But all of our \"chemical cocktails\" are made specifically for our BC types and unique situations. So some of us may be more prone to one thing or another. I know I am having weekly blood draws and we'll be able to follow my blood counts very closely. So I'll know if my platelets are low and be able to take special care if my body reacts that way. Willow77 - You are welcome to ramble here. This is a judgement free zone. I felt like saying no and running away yesterday when the MO and I went over the consent form and I looked at all the possible negative outcomes of chemo. Stay strong. You've got this! For all of you icing your hands and feet, can you explain how that works? I read that neuropathy is often exacerbated by temperature extremes. Does anyone understand what the icing does to prevent the neuropathy? That is the one SE that I'm most anxious about.

Melpub - Your injection story made me chuckle. Hope you don't lose too many droplets of that liquid gold. LisbethS - When the surgeon told me my dx and recommended I see a MO about chemo, I asked her right away what to expect. She told me what was the usual chemo course. So when I ended up talking to the MO I had a basic idea of what to expect. I'd just be careful where you get your information. Google can send you down all kinds of rabbit holes. Try to find the most reputable sources. You might also be able to find threads here where people have similar diagnoses and see what treatments they are doing. I'm sure the MO will give you drug info for what he/she recommends. If not, ask for it. Make sure you take good notes. Ask them to spell words you don't know so that you can look things up later. Take someone with you who will listen as attentively as you will and will also ask good questions. If there is a nurse navigator involved in your appointment, see if she will be taking notes. (I had that - so I could mostly just listen.) Write out all your questions and make sure you get them all answered. Find out who you should contact with more questions and how to best get in touch with them. Many health networks have online services where you can send a doctor a non-urgent question. Also, don't hesitate to get a second opinion if you are just not sure or if you are not feeling heard. This is a big decision. You will need to feel at peace about the choice you are making. Yes, you want to get your treatment sooner than later. But don't dive into anything that doesn't feel right. I hope I've helped. Praying for you. Oh...and with along with your massive research, make sure to make some time for yourself this weekend to do something that has nothing to do with BC. A mental break can help your thought process so much. Hugs! Well, it's the morning after. I actually slept well this first night. Decided to sleep on the day bed in our downstairs family room. I think I got a good 6 or 7 hours straight. Woke up feeling well. Fed the kitties and bunnies. Then thought about coffee. Turned on the Keurig and got this very light wave of nausea. Pulled out a tea pod rather than coffee. Took a Compazine and waited 1/2 hr. Felt fine so made some egg whites with melted cheese. Went down wonderfully. Other than that bit of nausea I've got a slight headache, but thinking that could be related to allergy season or stress considering where it hurts. Going to spend the day resting. Hope to get a walk in later this evening. Looking forward to all of your updates. Praying you are all well and avoiding SEs. ",

Had a really busy day yesterday - ran errands, cleaned, made a big crockpot dinner, took a 3 mile walk, played board games with my mom, and more. Must mean the steroid was doing its job all day long. Ended up going to bed later than planned, but I was okay with that since I'm finding if I go to bed too early that I'm waking up somewhere around 2 AM unable to go back to sleep. I planned to go to church this morning and woke before my alarm. Feeding the animals (we have cats & rabbits) and getting a huge glass of water was about all I could do before I flopped back down, turned off the alarm, and zonked out. I really didn't sleep that much longer, but it sure was sound sleep. Guess that's the \"sleeping like the dead\" WenchLori joked about. Caligirl - \"It was such a special time...\" HAHAHAHAHA! You ladies keep me laughing. I can so totally relate to the bleeding hemorrhoids. Only mine were agitated after a bout of constipation. Either way our poor bottoms can't win. Bought a lifetime supply of hand sanitizer yesterday. Putting pump bottles everywhere I go. Around the house, in the cars, at work, in my purse, in my chemo bag, in my work bag... I don't think I've ever washed or sanitized my hands this much in my life. Bought everything the grocery store had that would help boost my iron. Our pantry is now overflowing with a million foods I'd never buy. I have to admit I'm an anal planner. I've stockpiled bland foods, foods to combat nausea, high protein foods, and now iron rich foods. At this rate Thanksgiving diner is going to consist of white rice with ginger & dried apricots washed down with a protein shake. Going to try to do a few light chores around the house to get myself moving. I don't want to sleep the day away and end up not being able to sleep tonight. Busy day at work tomorrow. Want to do my best to be my best...whatever that looks like. Sending love to all and wishes for an SE-free Sunday!",

Maybe those of you experiencing insomnia as a SE will find this puts you to sleep. Welcome arlenew & ingridSA. Good to hear from you again, scarysadday. I hope your cold goes away. It's hard to kick one as it is, let alone with our weakened immune systems. Had the TV on yesterday. It was commercial time, so I went to fill up my water. Heard the word chemo so returned to the TV and here it was a commercial for the Neulasta pod. Made me think of so many of you are using that. Dara - You always make me laugh out loud. Now I am going to be looking for patterns in my peach fuzz. I like to think like you that some day I will get to meet at least a few of the wonderful ladies on here. seq24 - Wishing you well as you start your infusions. It may be hard. It is certainly NOT something you want. But you will find the strength. And we are here for you. Like you, I work with kids and was concerned to keep things \"the same\" and \"normal\" for them. My original plan was to start wearing my hats & scarves from day 1 of school so the elementary students would know me as the lady with the hats. Well, I was having fun with my mohawk, so I changed my mind. I figure I'll just go with the flow. Well, yesterday there was lots of coughing and sneezing. Since I had to be in a kindergarten classroom today, I decided I couldn't risk it and had to wear a mask. I expected the little ones to ask about it. We got started and no comments. A bit later I was helping a few little girls at one of the tables. One of them looks up at me. I'm waiting for it\u2026 What does she say? \"I really like your earrings.\" Here I was all worried about them and nervous about making them uncomfortable and they don't even care. They just tell me they like my hair and my earrings. Kids are way more resilient than we think. And they don't judge. That little girl today made my day! I can't believe that comment someone made to you about knowing you'll live 20 more weeks!!! Seriously? It would have take everything in me not to say, \"I hope you can run because if not you're going to be lucky to live 20 more seconds.\" Tishabe - Your daughter may be feeling more homesick than usual because she's concerned about you. I think it's okay for you to be honest with her that you need her to not add stress to you at this time. While it's your child and you want to be there to support her, she also needs to recognize that 10 calls a day might be overdoing it. Sensitivehrt- Hooray on the good lab results. Love your \"chemo face\". Pretty much expresses how we all feel about this. 3 pokes to find a vein? I'd be making a much more agitated face. Ugh! Have to say your plunger look is even better. Love it! I'd rock that look if I wasn't worried it'd mess up my mohawl. ;) AnnieTater! So good to see you again. Sorry you felt sick and have been busy. It would be nice to just rest and take care of yourself, but we women don't get too many chances to just focus on us. Excited to hear that baby girl is kicking away. She can help you kick cancer to the curb. LisbethS - I have labs an hour before each infusion. I've been told I could do them late the day before if I need to shorten the time I'm there on my infusion day. But the thought of driving there 2 days in a row (it's not far, just requires dealing with lots of traffic) is not on my list of things to do. I'd rather just jam it all in one trip, even if it means waiting that hour between the blood draw and the infusion. Oh, and feel free to rant here or anywhere. We get it. If you want to keep peace in the family but think your sister needs to be put in her place, I think most of us here would be happy to do it. ajbclan - I'm with you on hating being treated like \"you poor thing.\" Just treat me normally or leave me the heck alone. Lori - So good to see you back. We have missed you. I get my steroids at the start of my infusion as well. That sucks that your MO switched up your appointments for the long weekend. I guess BC takes a holiday when we do. Yeah, right. I second sensitive's recommendation of the L-Lysine. Have used it for years. It's a natural anti-viral. Caligirl - Sorry you've had a week of insensitive remarks made to you. Yes, most of those people were probably just trying to be supportive but just have no idea how. Even when I know that, I still get irked too. I must say, though, that friend who emailed you that article\u2026that person was totally clueless. Not sure how I'd handle that one. When those kinds of things have happened to me there's a part of me that wants to correct the person so they don't do it to someone else. Then another part of me thinks I'd be wasting my breath. If you haven't been in our shoes, I don't think you can really get it. djm71 - Chemo definitely is a tough road. Forget the SEs\u2026just navigating all the appointments and having BC really rule my calendar has been hard. I can relate to that emotion of feeling like this is something you can't put behind you. It is totally normal to feel that way. For me, I pray that I can find the balance of realizing the seriousness of my diagnosis so that I am proactive about my health and not letting myself live in either perpetual fear or oblivion. It is not easy. Some days are harder than others. Just another reason I'm so glad we have one another. The ladies here can appreciate the swinging pendulum of emotions we all endure. BTW, your sister sounds like a gem. Sattipearl - Glad to hear from you again. Equally glad you have an amazing BFF who is with you through your treatments and a CEO that knows how to be a blessing. I wish with all my might that I could change your diagnosis\u2026or that I had the right words. All I can tell you is that you are in my prayers and I am holding you close in my heart. Wishing you the most wonderful 10 days of feeling awesome. Looking forward to hearing about that amazing beach trip. We all need to remind each other to savor every moment. Life can be hard, but it can also be outrageously good . Sending love your way! Taxol/Herceptin #4 for me tomorrow. That means I'm 1/3 of the way through that protocol. Grateful for each and every one of you. You are amazing women, and I feel blessed to know you. Hugs!",

My dentist told me that some people get them so badly that they have a hard time keeping up with oral care. He prescribed a special toothpaste and recommended specific floss and tooth brushes. The floss is Listerine Gentle Gum Care. I got 2 types of brushes, both by GUM. One was 517 Sensitive Care Toothbrush. That is what I am using now, it is very soft. I also got the GUM 317 Post-Surgical toothbrush. I have not tried out one of these yet. I wasn't sure which would be the best, so I bought both. I got the brushes and floss on Amazon - better prices than buying direct from the manufacturer. The dentist gave me a prescription for one of the Colgate Prevident toothpastes. It cost me $18 for a container, but you don't use much. You are supposed to brush for 2 mins and not rinse, eat, or drink for at least 30 mins after brushing. It is supposed to offer extra protection for those having a hard time with dental care is how it was explained to me. I use it in the morning and before bed.",

I assure you that the Emla cream works like a charm. I didn't even feel the nurse access my port. What I need to figure out is how to cut a smaller square of plastic wrap. Every time I tried to cut a small piece it would stick to the scissors and then turn over on itself and stick together. It was pretty much a comedy of errors.

That was the only thing about my pathology that really hit me. But knowledge is power, and I feel grateful that doing the chemo was such a clear choice for me. Jiffrig - Glad to hear your infusion went well. Will continue to pray that your SEs are easily managed. ajbclan - I have cried very little about the diagnosis itself, but TONS about how the treatment has become the center of my life. Some days I felt like the only thing on the calendar were appointments and scarf shopping. Ugh! That's where going back to work has helped me. It's given me purpose and something to focus on. SweetRain - All the advice I've read and heard is that acrylic nails are out. I know it's not the same, but maybe you could still treat yourself to manicures and/or pedicures? I don't know what your chemo meds are, but for those of us on Taxol, we stand a high chance of brittle and darkening nails that may even fall off. I read on one of the boards that some ladies use dark nail polish to mask that SE. Since my hair is going to fall out, I think I am going to use the money I would have spent on cuts and color to do regular mani/pedis. HopeFloats - Thinking of you. Would love to hear anything you have to share about how you're doing with the silicone implants. I've got my TEs and haven't done expansion yet. Even though the PS was ready to do the first one last week, I wanted to find out how I'd handle the chemo and also keep an eye on an area where I'd had some necrotic tissue. He may be the expert, but it's my body. If my SEs remain manageable this week, I think I will schedule my first one sooner than later. AnnieTater - Work does take out minds off what's going on. I tend to be very active and independent. It's a learning experience to figure out how to do enough to be active but not so much that I over do it. My coworkers nagged me all week about that. Heard myself saying, \"yes mom\" a lot to them. Cool that your hubby's friend was so thoughtful. His secret is safe with all of us. Cali - Thanks for the prayers. They are always much appreciated. Looks like you're on a Monday regimen with Dara. Will be praying for you both that day. It would be kind of cool to keep a calendar of what day of the week everyone has treatments. Then we'd be able to check up on each other. I could look though this thread and put something like that together. Would that be something you ladies would be interested in? I don't want to offend or share for others. But someone just posted about how this group has grown and it's hard to keep track. I know something would help me. I feel like you are all my sisters. I'm open to all your thoughts. Sending love to all!",

Oh, Dara, you always manage to make me laugh. Now I envision you dancing at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony all dolled up like Carmen Miranda. To those of you starting this week - I packed a ton of things for my first infusion. I had two large bags. Needed my DH to help carry them in. Even though I knew about what the cancer center had to offer, I had no idea what I'd want. It's summer, but I'm always cold in A/C. So I wore shorts but packed longer pants and two different weight jackets. I also packed all kinds of snacks because I'd be there all day and didn't know what I'd want. While my hubby was taking me in, I kicked him out to go back to work and have some sense of normalcy. That meant I was on my own and it's not like anyone could run out and get me anything I needed. I pretty much packed everything but the kitchen sink (though I may have tossed the bathroom sink in there). Anyway, after the first infusion you'll get a better idea of what you might need. I was able to pack much more lightly the second week and may do even better this coming week. Sweet dreams, all!",

But if you do, I'm pretty sure your DH could hot glue something on in their place. ;) I am wondering too if I will be able to tolerate a hat at night. I bought a very sheer sleeping cap. It feels great when I try it on. But I tend to sleep hot. I have a set of SleepPhones (fleecy headband with embedded ear phones). On nights when I use that, I sometimes wake up and find I've flung it on the floor in my sleep. May have to try your towel mummy option",

I tend to get cold easily, and once my fingers or toes feel that way I am miserable. Just can't imagine icing them. Sure hope and pray that you ladies who do that achieve the intended outcome. I'm taking my chances as is. That's wild about your reaction. Glad to know your team was all over it and that you could complete your round successfully. I will keep you in my prayers. Hopefloats - Your trip sounds phenomenal. I would love to visit Lake Louise. Enjoy your family, your dress, your hair, your heels, and everything. Let us know all the fun details. Must say that since it's dawned on me that you live in Calgary, I've found myself singing Alberta Bound. My hubby's aunt lived in BC for many years and gave him the Gordon Lightfoot album (you know, those old time black spinning disks) with that song on many, many years ago. Every time we hear anything remotely related to Alberta we both break into the chorus. Think I'll sing it in your honor this weekend. KZ - So sorry you have had a rough day. Definitely listen to your body and get all the rest you need. Gotta love those hubbies who shave in support of their wives. Very sweet of your DH, Dara, to surprise you like that. If he wears one of your wigs, I think you need to share a pic. We promise not to make it go viral. Jiffrig - I told my hubby the same thing you did. Not much of a sacrifice to shave the 7 hairs on his head. Haha! I had headaches after the first infusion, but none after the second. Had a hard time deciding if they were related to my seasonal allergies or were a chemo SE. Since my brain surgery last year, I also have a tendency towards left sided tension headaches. So that factors in. Waiting to see what happens since I had round 3 today. Speaking of round 3 - that puts me 1/4 of the way done with my weekly Taxol/Herceptin regimen. Yay! After next week, I'll be able to say I'm 1/3 of the way done. Still will have the Herceptin every 3 weeks for the rest of a year, but after 12 weeks straight I'm hoping that is much more manageable. I worked this morning. Traffic through the the high tourist area here in PA Dutch country was crazy. All those mad quilters out to buy fabric here in the quilt capital of the region. And of course those crossing the street never look because they're too busy gawking at the Amish buggies and other sites. Ah, the joys of living and working where I do. Anyway, I made it just in time for my labs. Then ate some lunch and caught up on work emails (always crazy the first few weeks of school). My infusion went okay. But somehow the tower didn't work right. I'd had my steroid and the nurse started the Benedryl. I was working on a watercolor using some things the art therapist brought me and was feeling super - thought, \"Wow. My body is really adjusting to this med. No lightheadedness or woozy feeling.\" Then the nurse discovered it wasn't dripping. *face palm* So much for that. I do have to say, though, that when they tweaked the release time for that after infusion #1, I am doing much better with it. Art therapy was fun. I painted and we talked about it. Hung my artwork on the fridge like a kid. Drove home. Investigated the progress on the siding job we're having done. Thought I'd like to take a walk. Plunked down in the porch hammock and woke up 2 hours later. Fatigue 1, Desire to Exercise 0.",

The art was fun and distracting, the therapy part was even better. I definitely want her to come back at my next infusion. Also got a visit from a therapy dog. It was nice to be engaged in things that took my mind off of the machine and the drugs. Drank a lot. Tried the pickle juice - I really think it helped. I liked the taste too. For lunch they gave me a choice of a turkey or ham sandwich or a veggie wrap. Picked the veggie and it was DELICIOUS. They seriously know how to do things to make the experience as pleasant as possible and treat the whole person. Just sitting here snacking a bit and waiting for hubby to pick me up. He had volunteered to stay with me, but I sent him off to work for at least part of the day. Want him to have as normal of a life as he can. I figure I'll be calling on him to pick up a lot at home so he should get a break from dealing with my health while he can. WenchLori - Great to hear from you. I thought I might try to take a walk when I get home but I look out the windows and it's pouring out there. Thunder too. It's bright and sunny, so maybe we'll get a rainbow out of it. Feel free to send your storms east to us when you're done with them. We could use the rain and some cooling. sensitivehrt - Maybe people posting about your trip are a sign you should take one. Where would you go if you could right now? Wishing everyone a SE-free, joy-filled day. Sending much love.",

I just needed a break from thinking about BC (like I can get that, right?) as I was heading towards going down that rabbit hole of dread. Congrats to so many who have completed chemo! Yay yay yay! I've got 3 more rounds to go. If I don't miss any I'll be done Nov. 4. I plan to celebrate with my usual Friday post-chemo party...a nap. LOL I see Sensitive and someone else developed a weird rash. I had one too. First was on my left leg. Then on my right chest just between my port placement and my armpit. It reminded me of poison. Though I have no idea how I would have contracted that. Both resolved but took some time. Got dried out like poison would. There was never any weepiness. Just incredible itch. No recurrence of that. My current SEs du jour are nosebleeds and neuropathy. And I managed to have my nasal congestion and post nasal drip turn into laryingitis this week. When I called my MO to talk about it the nurse thought I sounded horrid, but I told her I felt great (minus the nosebleed, of course). I'm pretty sure it was just my typical change of season bout with sinusitis. But it sure is scary to get that when you're doing everything in your power to avoid getting sick. It also felt like my body was adding insult to injury and made for an emotional roller coaster of a week. But I'm 9 down, 3 to go with the Taxol/Herceptin combo. MO lessened the Taxol dose when the neuropathy began. Yesterday I fell asleep during treatment. Woke at the end of my Herceptin to a burning sensation in my GI tract. It subsided quickly but recurred at the very end. Was just about to call the nurse when I heard the tell tale beeping indicating that my session was over. Phew! But I still need to call the MO Monday and talk to her about it. It was weird and very scary. Can't even describe it well. Neuropathy is also no better, so I need to let her know that as well. Ugh! Sending love to all. Will try to do a better job of keeping up. You all mean a great deal to me, and I can't begin to express how thankful I am for all that I continue to learn from your experiences. Love to all!",

My initial thought about a wig is that it's \"not me\". But I may change my mind. I'm glad that I at least will have some fashionable options to wear to work. I think my big apprehension with a wig is how it will feel and if it will be secure enough on my head. I'm going to have to take a look around the forum and find a thread about that. Maybe I'll change my mind. It might be kind of fun to be able to pick out my look. It's not like I'd have to wear it every day.",
