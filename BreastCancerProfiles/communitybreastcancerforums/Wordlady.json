I'm now gradually extending the time between my Compazine and Ativan and then will see if I can get off one of them without any bad effects by Wednesday. For all I know, I could go without them now, but I'm just scared to revert to that level of nausea. The triage nurse said to work on adding an hour or two between pills for the next two days and see how it goes. If not for feeling really tired and like my brain is nothing but a puffy pink cloud, I would almost think everything was normal! I've been eating small amounts gently and trying to take in as much liquid as possible. The infusion nurse recommended PediaLyte for getting the electrolytes, which is like Gatorade for kids, so any of you with children probably know about it but it was new to me. Maybe the first one I got, \"fruit flavor,\" was just not a good choice as I don't like it much, but trying to get it down. To me it tastes alien, like it must be made with fruit from Neptune or something :-) What I do like is Propel Enhanced Water. They have that at Costco where I live, in various flavors including lemon, mandarin orange, and cranberry lime. It is intended for electrolyte replacement from sports, similar to Gatorade, but I think it is much much tastier. Give it a try if you are struggling with water taste. HapB, sorry about that, anti-emetic is just another word for anti-nausea. Upheld, I'm having those same experiences with food. I had a weird craving for a pickle. So I ate a small dill pickle very slowly in about 8 separate pieces to make sure it was going to be all right, and it was. Same thing with salty potato chips. So I think it is about the salt somehow. It seems to me that the only time we should FORCE ourselves to eat something is if we haven't eaten anything in 2-3 hours. It does seem to make nausea worse to have nothing in your stomach. I don't think eating more volume at a time is necessarily good or bad; it's one of those things that depends on the individual body. But if something sounds good to you, and isn't contraindicated by your meds or something, then I'd try a little bit and see how it goes. I'm a believer in listening to my body as it frequently (though not always :-) ) knows best. Wendeez, I think I'm on the same regimen as you so I'll be anxious to hear how yours goes. Ciaci, sending healing light to you!",

I had my BMX with DIEP reconstruction on 4/21 but blood supply problems meant it had to be removed again 3 weeks later; I will redo the reconstruction after chemo/radiation is done, probably next January or so. The tummy incision has been slow to heal which is why I haven't started the chemo yet, but I'm possibly getting my port on the 8th or else on the 16th based on doctor availability. Then I would start soon after that. I am doing Penguin cold caps and having someone from Penguin come for my first treatment to help us learn how to do it, so I have to be able to give them a little notice. . .it's hard to schedule when you don't have a date yet. :-) Anyway I have been reading through all the great info on these boards and appreciate it so much.

Originally, they thought the tumor was smaller, about 2.5, and my surgeon took my case to the \"tumor board\" originally suggesting a full axial dissection (am I spelling that right?) in other words taking them all out. But the board recommended not doing that because of then getting lymphedema. So they didn't take the nodes out, but then found during surgery that the tumor was much larger than originally thought. Testing showed micrometastases but a low oncotype (14). I think if they had realized the size originally, I might have had chemo or radiation in advance, but instead I had the surgery first and am starting DD AC (4) and Taxol (12) next week with radiation to follow. Eschofi, my doctor prescribed Letrazole (lowers estrogen production in postmenopausal women) because of the similar delays I had getting started with chemo. I'm not sure of your age/other factors so that might not be suitable for you, but you might ask if there's something you could be taking to help tide you over and extend that optimal window. Sana18, thank you so much for your reassuring report! It is great to hear that you have done so well. As it's sometimes hard to maintain optimism, hearing about good experiences is really helpful. Along those lines, I had my port placed this morning and it went very well -- totally uneventful. The area is a little achy/sore, mainly when I turn my head, but I would equate it to a muscle strain, nothing major at all. I've been icing it on and off every 15 minutes since we got home about 11 AM (it's now about 5 PM) and took some Tylenol, but don't expect to need anything more. I can see the tubing running up across my collarbone and about 2 inches up my neck, but it doesn't really seem that noticeable and so far there's virtually no bruising. We'll see how it looks and feels tomorrow. . . but so far, so good.",

Are you taking the Claritin/is it helping at all with the Neulasta pain? I got my port 4 days ago and it is somewhat tender but much better than the first day. I have slept some on that side; I find if I can get the pillow scrunched just right I can avoid any contact with the sore area, so then it is just a matter of it waking me up when I go to turn over in my sleep. It looks good though, only very very minor bruising in a small spot and hardly any redness anymore. Tomorrow is the pre-beginning-chemo blood draw; I found out that this time they don't use the port because it is in the lab instead of the infusion area, so one of you ladies (Legomaster?) was right on that one! Same building and same waiting room, hence my confusion.",

They didn't give me Benadryl, but I did get Emend, Kytril, and the steroid. The only thing I noticed was some sinus congestion and a slight headache during the Cytoxan, which I was told to expect, and it has mostly cleared now about 1-1/2 hours later. The nurse said they can run the Cytoxan a little slower next time and that may help. I have my Neulasta pod on, which is set to go off tomorrow about 3:30 pm. I have the Zofran and Compazine ready to go if needed, wearing my sea-bands, have ginger tea and ginger hard candies, and drinking lots of water. Since I didn't get any Benadryl I didn't get sleepy, so was glad I took some things to do: a book, my iPod, a journal. I took my iPad also so I could watch something on Netflix but never got around to that. I did a couple of \"dot to dot\" puzzles in a book my sister-in-law gave me so I could send her a photo of me doing them :-) . But now I definitely am heading for the recliner for most of the rest of today! Thanks for all the support and hope everyone else is having a good day.",

I mentioned before that infusion day was uneventful; day #2 Thursday was pretty uneventful as well. The Neulasta pod did its thing without any trouble and I haven't really noticed any side effects from that. Unfortunately day #3 came on with a vengeance, starting with nausea at 2 AM Friday and progressing from there in ways you can all imagine without detailed description. :-) I can now understand why Adriamycin is nicknamed \"the red devil.\" Anyway, ultimately we went back to the clinic at 3 pm Friday for more IV anti-emetics and hydration. Driving 90 minutes round-trip while feeling sick in Friday afternoon traffic in a heat wave in the SF Bay Area -- SO not recommended! So that was a fairly unpleasant 12-hour period. But they gave me IV Kytril and Ativan, and a prescription for Ativan tablets which seem to work better. The Zofran tablets (basically the same as Kytril, I think they said?) definitely caused a really bad headache that wouldn't go away with either Tylenol or normal ibuprofen. I've never had a migraine in my life so I don't know, but I certainly had a really bad headache. They told me to take some 800 mg ibuprofen that I already had on hand, and that helped finally. So day #3 and day #4 were not at all pleasant -- and in the course of them I didn't take any of my normal meds including the Claritin so I need to get back on schedule with those. However, finally I'm feeling more normal. I'm now not taking the Zofran tabs at all; instead I'm alternating Ativan and Compazine. There is discussion going around with the doctor and the clinic about changing what premeds they give me for next time. I have been eating small bits of bland things every couple of hours and drinking a lot of lemon water. I agree that keeping something in the stomach makes a big difference in avoiding the nausea. At this point on day #5, are most of you past the need to take the anti-emetics? Frankly I'm afraid to stop taking them for fear of the nausea starting up again. I can call the triage line tomorrow to check in about that, I guess, but thought I would inquire. ",

I discovered that shopping around can save some money. For the price of the first wig I considered but didn't buy, I ended up getting a quite inexpensive decent wig as well as a halo (partial wig) for hats and two chemo caps from different online stores. I also ordered a couple of terry hat sizers from the Cancer Society online shop, so I can use some of the hats I already have. I already have a lot of scarves that a friend taught me to tie nicely (YouTube is helpful too). Since I'm crafty :-) I found some free patterns for different kinds of caps/turbans online and am making one today -- don't know if I will have much energy to make more in the near future, but maybe! Like you I expect to use the scarves most of the time along with the caps. But I just feel better knowing that I have choices.",
