It felt relatively smooth and had some firmness to it when she just found it. However, the worrying thing is that within 3-4 days the initial 2-3cm long lump has grown to extend from the nipple to almost the underarm. It still feels a little like a blood vessel, except it now has rougher and lumpier edges and it feels more like semi-detached and slightly elongated pea-shape-like things. It also feels a little firmer than before. She had been feeling pain every now and then in that breast before discovering the lump and it still hurts now when she presses the lump or the area around the lump.  I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice or their opinion about this situation and is it possible for a lump to develop that quickly if it does seem to be cancerous? My mother is scheduled for a mammograph in a few days but she is really upset and worried sick about this discovery and I am really running out of ideas and ways to comfort her too. Many thanks if I can get some help for this. P.s. My mother is post-menopausal and in her later-50s (if that helps) Log in to post a reply",
