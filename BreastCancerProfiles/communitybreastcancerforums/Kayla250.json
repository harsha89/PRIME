Having the two different doctors on your case is a benefit to you. Doctor's are really expected to err on the side of caution; really the \"Rule out\" rule. That is to say, I believe your boob doc is trying to satisfy this...to refer you to procedures that will definitively \"rule out\" cancer and once that's is done you will be able to relax. It is the waiting that is the worst part of the whole process. I am glad that you were able to have done, what was done for you, so quickly.

Up here in Canada, I don't live in a major centre so on a month by month basis, we see a GP with special education in supporting an MO in satellite communities. My appointment today was with this GPO. He showed me my CT of the liver mets and I am still in a little shock how big the largest tumour looks...6.5cm, I can't imagine how those that have had liver tumours as big as 20 must look. It is in Segment 4a there are 6 other smaller throughout the liver. He cannot give me definitive answers as to the next step but Ibrance is now stopped, I remain on Letrozole.

Although, I don't know what I'd do without the fatigue side effect, it has been a nice excuse for me these days (just kidding), it would be nice to have some side effects that give unbelievable energy, supple skin and thick, luscious hair; a girl can dream can't she? I digress, have a great weekend. ",

The 6 month follow up will just confirm the area remains unchanged. Just as yearly or every second year follow up mammograms do. Was the whole mass removed? One that size will make scar tissue if its own, make sure you remember that that will show up as a post therapeutic change",

I have not had treatment for a month (Ibrance/Letrozole immediately failed) so I'm hoping this kicks in quickly. My tumour continues to stretch the capsule and irritate the diaphragm so a tumour regression would be a welcome outcome. Then I can cut back on my pain meds. Have a great night! ",

After finding out that Ibrance failed and my tumours double in size and number, I felt hopeless again. But now 4 days into Xeloda chemo I, somehow, found that hope again. I can only imagine how many ups and downs you've been thru in 3 years. You'll get thru this low point, as you have always done in the past. Our hope is in the next amazing treatment breakthroughs. Good night and a peaceful sleep to all. ",

They then took me in for an ultrasound and the sonographer did say that the radiologist wanted a better look at an area. I have since gone for a biopsy in that area, and I am waiting for those results. Upon leaving the ultrasound department,I knew I needed to wait for the report to be sent to my doctor. Out of curiosity why were you referred to the breast ultrasounds to begin with? Where you aware of a lump?",
