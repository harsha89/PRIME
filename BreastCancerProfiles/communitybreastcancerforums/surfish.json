In January 2015 as I was putting on my pjs, I felt something really hard on my left breast, so I checked it and I felt a lump. I immediately setup an appointment with my OB/GYN who palpated both breasts and noticed it, so he ordered an Ultrasound. I had the ultrasound done and it confirmed a complex cyst, BIRADS 4. The radiologist suggested a FNA and the sample turned out to be insufficient. So my OB/GYN once again suggested another biopsy, but a core needle biopsy this time. Results showed adenosis, so the doc suggested follow-up US every 6 months. FFW to yesterday, when I had my follow up US. The lump grew considerably, as per the report terms. So while I managed to move my appointment to see my OB/GYN today, he suggested that I get an appointment with Dr. Jose Fernando Robledo and miraculously someone cancelled an appointment tomorrow so I'll be able to go. I'm a bit concerned as yesterday's US is a category BIRADS 4A so it is more suspicious than the first one. Plus, it grew and has begun to cause some discomfort. I think I'm willing to accept any kind of result, given that there's treatment for most diagnosis. But I must confess I'm a bit concerned about it. Any advice on this will be greatly appreciated. Sorry for my spelling/grammar mistakes, english is not my first language but I came here because there are no resources like this where I live. Plus your forum has proven to be incredibly helpful. Thanks in advance.",

Next day (Friday) I had no pain at all, I was just still a bit groggy from the anaesthesia. Stitches haven't been removed but it's healing well, as per the Dr's words. Will let you know when the pathology results come back. Happy week everyone! K.",

Well, it turns out that I'm now scheduled to have a partial mastectomy on September 15. The Drs. said it was better to remove the lump given that it grew and that it started generating discomfort. I'll let you know how it goes! Thank you very much for the explanation on the BIRADS grading. It's better to rule out anything anyway. Have a great week :) K.",
