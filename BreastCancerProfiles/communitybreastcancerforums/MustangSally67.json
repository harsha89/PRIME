(The day after my 44th Birthday) I have 2 little boys age 6 and 3.5. I am terrified and I hate waiting. I know it all sounds good and my oncologist is well respected in the NW but it still sounds like an early death sentence. I don't know when they will schedule surgery for the lymph nodes. She did remove all the cancer when she did the biopsy on Tuesday. I went in on June 22nd for a mamm/usound because I had a lump, which was only a cyst. What if I hadn't gone in? This was my first mamm. I nursed both boys over 2 years... I thought this was supposed to help. I also have implants that are almost 10 yrs old. I am not sure what my options are at this point. This totally sucks! I was supposed to do a triathlon on July 30th!!! Dx 7/21/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
