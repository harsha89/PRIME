This confirms what I learned during the course of this journey: one could never be prepared enough for what's coming... psavast, did you see your radiation oncologist? What did he/she say? I am wondering, did it opened up after you finished the radiation? It must the last few boost that made it heppen. You are totally entitled to whine and I hope you feel better soon! Jo_Ann_K, yes I think that's a good way to look at it and that'd be a worth-while sacrifies, to stop the cencer from returning. PauldingMom, you still have that square brown mark after 6+ months? Well, I guess I will not expect mine to go away soon then.",
