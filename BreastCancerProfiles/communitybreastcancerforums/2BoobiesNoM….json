I am 64, and run a business.. i still work 9-10 hours a day, and do not know how i will get thru this. Very lucky, caught on routine screen.. stage 0 ductal (?) Don't know all the new words yet. Double mastectomy scheduled, though.. should cure with no radiation or chemo... i live in a world where no one talks about these things! Like disappearing in the 60\"s when a young girl got pregnant. I haven't taken a 2-week vaca for 20 years... how do I say I have to be out for a few weeks?? I am the strong one... not the one who needs help and support..ðŸ˜¢",
