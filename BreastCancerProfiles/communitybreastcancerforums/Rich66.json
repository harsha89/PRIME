With mom, it started with the dark/red look, progressed to feeling warm, then became a problem. Basically, the Xeloda has a way of leaking into healthy tissues and goes to the extremities. Things that seem to help: Udder Cream (available at Wal-Mart) Note: apply liberally but GENTLY. Vigorous rubbing can aggravate things. Apply a few times throughout day. Good to goop it on at night and wear cotton socks or gloves to keep it there. B6 supplement, 200mg/day \" The addition of pyridoxine (200 mg/day) for ameliorating the symptoms of CAP-induced HFS allows for the administration of higher doses of CAP\" Topical Henna, purchase here: www.castleart.com discussed here: http://xelodasideeffects.blogspot.com/ Interesting anecdote: \"Henna is a natural antiseptic and the chemical in henna fills the skin cell thus it can keep hands from cracking . Field workers in India would dig small recesses in the dirt fill with henna & water ans dip their hands & feet in the mix to help prevent the skin from cracking and keep other nasty bacteria away.\" Mom also used generic neosporin from Walgreens for splits. Staying off feet as much as possible until things calm down may help. I would suggest trying all the above before approaching docs since they may only offer dose reduction or longer breaks. There is suggestion that a \"metronomic\" (low-dose without breaks) might be better in the long run since it gives cancer less opportunity to recover. There ar eexamples of patients successfully revisting previously \"failed\" xeloda (and other chemos) in metronomic fashion. i.e., it might be a failed delivery approach. Taking more of the daily dose at night is thought to be less toxic and more effective as well.",

Maybe it's the dosing that \"failed\". For those who ghave run out of choices and are too sick for normal doses, this may be a verygood option. Another option is to have a biopsy tested to see what chemo it is sensitive to. It seems this can sometimes lead to a more lasting therapy: her2support.org/vbulletin/show...  Knowing the sensitivity could make metronomic chemo more effective..I think. Some drugs may work/work better when given at specific times: her2support.org/vbulletin/show... ",
