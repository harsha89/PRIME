Sorry to say, when I went for my pre chemo talk, the nurse told me \"  YOU WILL lose you hair!\"  I had Taxotere & Cytoxan, too.  I lost MOST of my hair, but not all of it.  It was kind of patchy, and at first I looked like Sluggo.  But, my hair is back now.  I had long hair before bc...  but now, I doubt that it will grow back.  It seems to get to just one length, but won't grow any further...    ....sigh...     My dh says that I am just too impatient!   But, I just went for a trim, because it was getting really unruly.  So I am starting to think that I probably will not have long hair again... Yours may grow back faster and better.  That is just my experience so far.  Harley",

Binney, Thanks for your encouragement!   I will see what my onc nurse suggests, but she will probably send me to the LE therapist.  The LE person never suggested wrapping, or even showed me how to wrap.  I was getting ready to have my breast reconstruction surgery, so we were kind of strapped for time, and needed to just get the swelling in my hand down, before I had my surgery.  She did it, but it didn't go ALL THE WAY DOWN!  I can't wear my wedding ring on my left hand.  It was just the hand that was affected, as far as we can tell.  But, it is just SO ANNOYING!  I'll definitely be back to report what I find out, and to see if we can come up with any more ideas...    Thanks for not making me feel more inadequate than I already feel.  You are so very knowledgeable, and also very caring!! I want everything to be NORMAL again, but I'm just reaching the point where I am realizing that NOTHING in my life is going to be the same again, and it really makes me mad!  But, I am trying to learn how to adjust to the NEW normal...

It's me again...  I had a Neulasta shot in the LE arm, and a couple of weeks later, my hand swelled up!  It was just AWFUL!  This was back in September...  I went to an LE therapist and she put my arm in a machine, and it 'decompressed' my arm and hand.  It SEEMED to work pretty well the FIRST time she used it, but I had a few more txs, and it never worked as well.  I also got a glove and a sleeve to wear, 'just in case', since my arm never got any swelling.  I wore the glove, but when I would take it off at the end of the day, and I was told NOT to wear it at night, when I'm sleeping, my hand was all puffy.  WTH?  So I stopped wearing the glove, and the swelling seemed to go down to a 'tolerable' lever.  Now understand, it STILL looks BIGGER than the other hand, but it doesn't look all puffy, like the Pillsburgy DoughBoy.  My joints also hurt, when I make a fist.  Now I don't do the exercises like she showed me either, but when I DO them, I don't notice any change.  I am so frustrated about all this, because it would NEVER have happened, if that stupid onc nurse hadn't given me the Neulasta shot.  My LE therapist told me that I should be grateful that my LE was very mild, and my arm didn't swell up like a tree trunk.  Still, I just wish it would go back to the way it was before bc....

I will ask my onc nurse when I see her next month, but I am sure that there is nothing they can do.  I am very concerned that whenever I wear the glove, my hand gets puffy.... WTH?  I thought it was supposed to keep things under control...  I stopped wearing it, cause it was NO HELP at all.  My dh got mad at first, but one day I wore the glove ALL DAY, and then showed him what it looked like when I took it off.  and yes, I know, I know, I am supposed to do this massage myself, but as I said, the exercises don't seem to have any effect on this.  Thanks... I'll see what my onc nurse says.  I hate the idea that I'll just have to keep going for more LE therapy, for the rest of my life, and my insurance SUCKS,  I don't know WHY my pcp dr's office is always so NASTY!!   If I can get the necessary referrals from my pcp, the insurance works well, but NO ONE wants to take it, because they don't pay the drs. very much... ......sigh....  and my dh wonders why I am so depressed, and why I get into a screaming match with my dr.?  Thanks Harley",

I have an appt. with an LE specialist on Monday, at 9AM... about my swollen hand, from mild lymphedema. Yes, I am a little bit afraid... facing another surgery...  but it will be nice to have breasts again.  I think I should get SOMETHING positive out of this, even if it IS BIGGER BREASTS!  I've always been small, so I am going just a little bigger... No, I think just about all the women I read about here have done the reconstruction at the same time as the mast., but I am using the all in one expander/implant, so I won't need that second \"exchange\" surgery that most women get.  My ps will still do the 'fills' until they are the right size, but I just get to skip that other surgery.  My ps and my general surgeon did not want me to have this surgery BEFORE the chemo, but other drs. would probably have done it... My drs. were just SO AFRAID of infection, with me starting chemo, even though I wasn't sure I was going to get the chemo at first... I read your post about working out, and I went for a walk yesterday, too, because I was just SO tired, and I was worried I wouldn't get out again for awhile, due to the fatigue...  I didn't walk today, but I will try to make an effort tomorrow.  I usually get out for a walk or run every other day or so.  I think it is important in keeping all the nasty se's at bay... Is the Iscador given in the veins, as chemo is?  If so, I would have to say NO...  I have had enough of chemo for now...  lol In an earlier post, you mentioned that I am brave and strong, but really... I'm not... Since all this bc stuff happened, I have been wanting to hide under the bed with my cat, Spike... but he isn't even going under there anymore... But, if a chicken like me can get through these treatments, so can ALL THE REST of you STRONG WOMEN!! Hugs Harley",

My wigs are pretty comfortable, well, the FIRST one I bought is, but I have those ear problems with the second one.  I try to position the wig so it doesn't cover my ears, but it is rather difficult.  Also, I read in the directions in a catalog, that you should put the wig on, and put ALL THE HAIR behind your ears.  Then, move only the hair you want to cover the ears forward... I hope this helps some... Good Luck! HARLEY",

I thought it was nice... him trying to reassure me that I am still ok. I also started noticing women and their hair.  SO many women have such VERY SHORT hair, that they look as if they have been thru chemo.  I don't want to approach someone, unless I am sure.  I met a woman at the coffee shop, and she had a baseball cap on, with the pink bc ribbon on it, so I kinda 'knew'.  Anywho, I just wanted to say that it seems that we see more women who have had bc after we are dx'd.  It is kind of like when we buy a new car, and we start seeing lots of cars just like it on the highway.

I know, very stupid of me. Hope you all are feeling better soon.  I also exercise when I have time, but with this p/t job, it's hard to try to fit it in.  Edited to add:  Nicki, a thyroid disorder isn't always so easily treated.  I have been taking Levotyroxine for the past 10 years, and I still have problems with fatigue alot...  My drs. think it is just a matter of taking a pill every day, and you are all better, but it isn't.  I think it may be that for me, at least, I have Hashimotos thyroiditis, which is an auto immune disorder, and my body thinks that my thyroid is a foreign invader, so it is always trying to fight it.  That is just my two cents worth...

I also spent ALOT of time, mulling the chemo decision over in my mind, and it took longer for me to get the Oncotype test, because my insurance wouldn't pay for it. He was a SECOND opinion onc., because the first guy was just too blase for me... he said \"You have to trust me...\"  WTH??  HOW can I trust someone I JUST MET, with my LIFE???  The second opinion onc helped me to get the Oncotype test, and the company isn't going to charge me for the test, even though my insurance refused to pay for it.  I found out later, that he wanted me to get AC, and Adriamycin is one of the MOST toxic chemo drugs, and can cause heart problems.  I believe that we have to research this and do what is best for us... I also believe that we only have ONE LIFE, so while we shouldn't think that we have to get chemo, we need to do research, and find the best chemo drugs for us... I ended up getting 4 txs of Taxotere & Cytoxan, and I am here over a year since my bc dx, and I can tell you that it is definitely DOABLE..  No, it's no fun, but I am the biggest chicken, and if I could do it, SO CAN YOU!! As for the 'window of opportunity' for chemo, I started chemo just at the 3 month mark after my bi-lateral mast...  I believe that the chemo worked it's magic, to help prevent recurrence, and I'm now taking Tamoxifen.    My breast surgeon insisted that I get chemo, he felt that because of my age, I had MORE time for a recurrence to occur.  He was the only one who really cared.  My onc and I went toe to toe about which chemo to use, since he found out that my insurance wouldn't pay very much, and he couldn't bill me for the difference.  He wanted to switch me from TC to AC, because Adriamycin is less expensive, and I refused... We get along well now, and my dh said it's because he saw that I wasn't just going to do whatever he said.  Good luck!  I'll be thinking about you and praying for you...  I'm hoping that your new onc will want to start your treatment, ASAP!!

I was SO SCARED when I walked into that office on the day of my 1st tx!!  But I didn't let my onc know...  I was glad that my MIL was there, for support, even though there wasn't much she could do.  She saw me go toe to toe with my onc, and she told me that from then on, she wouldn't worry about me, 'cause I can stand up for myself!   Sorry, I digress... After my insurance case manager explained to my onc how the insurance worked, he came in to the room.  I was talking on my cell phone to my case manager when he came in, and I said...\"well, I gotta go... I guess my onc is going to tell me that he can't see me anymore...\"  The onc said, \"Why do you think I'd say that?\"  I told him, \"because now you know how my insurance works!\"  He just laughed.  But, he then told me that he wanted to change out my chemo drugs.  I said... to what?  He said ... \"to AC... How do you feel about that?\"  I said \" I think, If you give me Adriamycin, It will KILL me!\"  He backed right up against the wall and said \"no chemo for you!\"  I was just about to leave and go home, when I stopped to talk to the woman in the office, and he walked by.  She said \"Are you going to do the chemo?\"  and he said YES!   So, the short answer, made long by my story, was that my onc just gave in to my request.  He went away, and thought about it, so I didn't know until I got in that chemo chair if he agreed to use TC...  I think if you explain to your onc about your fears, they will agree to the chemo that will work for you, without damaging your heart. Good Luck!  Please let me know how it goes, if you decide to get chemo.  You know, I didn't know that I could stand up for myself like that, so I guess that is yet another thing that having bc has taught me... Hugs Harley P S Sorry for the long post, but now that it's over, it is a rather amusing story.",

Please keep pushing til you get some answers, and post here to let us know how you are doing. Thinking of you, and praying that you will get b-9 results. Hugs, Harley",

As a general rule, they usually want to start chemo within 3 months of your surgery, for the lumpectomy.  With that being said, I was so conflicted about the chemo issue, and my insurance would not cover the Oncotype test, that I had my bi-lateral mast. on 5/2/2007, and didn't start chemo til 8/7/2007, because I eventually saw a 2nd opinion onc. who called the Genomic Health co. rep and asked if they would help me.  I spoke to the Genomics rep, and they agreed that we qualified for 100% assistance, and they wrote off the cost of the test.  Anyway, just wanted you to know that I got chemo a little bit later than everyone else.  Your dr. will know for sure if there is a timeline that you need to adhere to.  Good Luck!

The little blip I watched was very informative.  Many of us need LOTS more Vitamin D, especially in the Winter. I have seen this in two places, and one is Cure Magazine, it is noted that Effexor is a weak inhibitor of Tamoxifen...    Probably since there aren't very many anti depressants that you can take, it is one that would interfere the least, so it is probably fine for you to take it.   FWIW, my primary care dr.'s wife had bc 25 years ago, when she was 30, and he told me that SHE also took Tamoxifen, and Wellbutrin, which is a POTENT inhibitor of Tamoxifen, and she is fine today...  so who knows?? I just had so much trouble when I stopped Effexor.  I even had a meltdown in the Wal Mart.  So I am a bit skittish about starting up again.  Maybe I'll wait to see how the increased D3 works for me.  Good Luck with Effexor...  I'm sure it'll be fine.

I never smoked, so I am no help there.  In fact, since my biopsy, I can't tolerate the smell of smoke...  it makes me gag!  But I understand the addiction, and so I don't think even your onc would make you quit, during tx. Drinking... my onc nurse told me that an occasional drink wouldn't hurt us.  I didn't ask about alcohol, she told me this, so I really agree with Lillith, that moderation is key, and listening to your body when it tells you STOP...  I did have a drink once in awhile, and even had one drink when I got home, in the evening, after my first tx... I felt that I needed to celebrate, just a little... and after my last tx, my dh and I went out to dinner with some friends, from the coffee shop, and we bought a bottle of champagne, and shared it with our friends.  I had ONE glass.  I felt that these little celebrations are what got me through tx.  Good Luck, ya'll!

Harley P S  Glad to read that you are getting good care there.  I have read that they have a breast center now at Walter Reed, so I am sure they are making progress in the area of breast cancer.  It may be that the only other care I got there was for other, routine type stuff... ",

Sheila, I am worried about starting an AI when I ALREADY have osteopenia in my hip...  it will only get worse on the AI...    so I am wondering if it is worth it to take a drug which scares the bejesus out of me, with all the se's, or should I just trudge thru on Tamoxifen for the rest of my 5 years?? I guess I'll try it, and if I can't tolerate it, then I'll go back to Tamoxifen. Linda, Hey, great to see you!!   I did have a bit of a rough time at first with Tamoxifen.  It caused my endometrial lining to thicken, and I had these uterine polyps.  I had a D & C, and the pathology came back benign.  But, it hurt so bad, so I never want to have to go through that again!! HannahBearsMom: I remember you from the Tamoxi-train!!  You may not have to switch to an AI, if you do ok with Tamoxifen.  My onc. just wanted to switch me, probably because I was adamant about NOT having to have a D & C again, from the se's from Tamoxifen.  Also, there were some studies which suggest that maybe it's beneficial to start on Tamoxifen for two years, and then to switch to an AI.  We shall see... Hope everyone has a Happy Holiday Season!  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!  May the New Year bring each and every one of you much happiness!!   May we dance with NED forever!!!! ",

      "Content": "Oct 24, 2007 08:19AM - edited Oct 24, 2007 08:20AM by Harley44 Wintermoon: I don't know your specific info. on your breast cancer, but if the tumor is very small (less than 1 cm), you may not need to get chemo...  it really just depends on what your dr. recommends.  Also, the stage of your bc, and whether or not the lymph nodes were positive... I had a small tumor, .8cm, stage I, grade 2, no lymph node involvement,  HER2 negative, ER+/PR+...   So, my doctors thought I may benefit from chemo also.  I was in the gray area, and the decision was left up to me.  There is a test called the Oncotype DX test, which tests part of the bc tissue they took out.  It assigns a number to the tissue based on all the 'personality traits' of the bc, some of which I  mentioned about mine... size, grade, etc.  and it predicts your risk for recurrence in the next 10 years.  This helps to decide whether chemo may help you.   Usually, if the tumor was ER+, the pills, Tamoxifen or another type estrogen inhibitor are effective in blocking estrogen's effects on any bc  cancer cells that may still be in your system.  Because in my case, the Oncotype test results were RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, it was not much help for me.  So, I decided to go ahead and get the chemo, too.  This way, I can be sure that I did ALL I CAN to prevent recurrence.  However, you may not need chemo. If you get chemo, you will have chemo BEFORE you get radiation or the hormone treatment.  Depending on which surgery option you choose, you may or may not need radiation.  I had bi-lateral mastectomy (BOTH breasts were removed, to make my reconstruction easier.), and did not need to get radiation.  So, since I finished my chemo on Oct. 9th, and I really had minimal side effects from it, I will need to start the hormone treatment soon.  I may take Tamoxifen for a couple of years, and then switch to one of the other options, like Arimidex or Aromasin, or Femara.  I would take one of these for maybe 5 years...  I hope I didn't give you too much information, but that was just my experience.  It has been a long journey, but once I made the decision to get chemo, it has gone pretty quickly, and I am here to say that even if your drs. recommend chemo, it is definitely DOABLE!  It isn't something that any of us WANT to do, and I wouldn't want to do it again, but WE CAN DO IT!!  I will be having my reconstruction surgery on Nov. 7th, and that is only 2 weeks away!! Good Luck!  Post often, please let me know how you are doing.  I really think that it helps to talk with others who have been through the same experiences.  We understand, and will support you, whatever decisions you make along the way. Hugs, Harley",

Welcome!  I am sorry you had to join this club, but I am glad that you found us!  You will find the women & men here are very warm, helpful and supportive... and Knowledgeagble too! I had Stage I bc,  .8 cm, estrogen & progesterone positive.  What this means is that the tumor is very sensitive to these hormones, and they make it grow.  So the pills the dr. told you about would most likely be Tamoxifen, or Arimidex.  You don't say how old you are, but if you are young, and pre-menopausal, you will likely be given Tamoxifen.  I am post-menopausal, age 44, as I have a condition which put me into menopause very early.  For us Post-menopausal women, the Arimidex has been found to be very effective.  My dr. has told me that I will be starting Tamoxifen soon, since I was concerned about some of the side effects of Arimidex.  There is ALOT to learn, and this bc journey can be a rollercoaster ride at times, especially with all the emotional turmoil it causes.  But, it will be just a bump in the road for you.  You WILL get through this!  There are lots of other women here who will give you lots of good advice, too!

I only have 2 more txs, so I am halfway through!  My next tx is Sept. 18th, and then the last (YIPPEE!) is Oct. 9th! How fast did your hair grow back?  I have noticed that there seem to be some darker hairs growing in... at first, it was TOTALLY WHITE!  I didn't like that... but now it doesn't seem to be falling out as much... so maybe it is trying to grow back in... and good, if it doesn't stay white...

They were a GREAT bunch of people! I quit this p/t job, when my dh decided to move to North Carolina, near the beach!!  It is GREAT here!  I love it!  But, it has been difficult this past year, since he was working in DC, he is in the Navy.  But, he's retired now, and has come down to NC, to be with me....  He's only been here for about 2 weeks, but it is good to have him here.  He tried to come when he could.  I was dx'd in March, and he came down and spent 2 weeks with me...  I just had my 3rd tx on Tuesday, Sept. 18th.  My last tx will be Oct 9th, so I will be finished!  YEAH!!  I had a bi-lateral mast. on May 2nd, and will have my reconstruction on Nov. 7th... It will be so nice to finally be finished! Thanks for your encouraging story!!  My boss from my other job will be coming down to visit the first week of October, just before my last tx.  It will be nice to see her again. I have found that throughout my bc experience, I have met MANY very nice people, who have helped me along the way.  Also, I have found that whenever I need something, GOD has provided it... sometimes, before I even know I need it!!  God Bless, Harley ",

I'm not sure it is correct...  If I were you, I wouldn't  count on getting an Oncotype score that will help with your decision.  At first I said NO to the chemo, but after much reflection, I decided to go for it, and I'm glad I did.  The factors that made me decide were:  1   I am 44 y.o.  and my surgeon said I should get the chemo, since I am still relatively young.  The younger you are, the more time we have left to live, and the more time we have left to live, the more time the bc has to recur... It comes back in some really terrible places, too... 2  I want to make sure that I have done ALL I CAN to prevent bc recurrence...  I only have ONE life!!  Good Luck with your decision.  I know how hard it is... whatever you decide, keep posting.  We are here for you, and support you!

I say all this just so you know that even though my surgery was May 2nd and I started chemo on Aug. 7th... so it was just over 3 months from my surgery date, but I feel confident that I am getting rid of any microscopic bc that may be hanging around.  My age was a big factor in deciding about chemo... I am 44, so I am still relatively young, and my drs. said that the younger you are, the longer you still have to live, and the more time for you to have a recurrence, so that put me at higher risk for recurrence than I originally thought I would be, and I just was not comfortable with my decision to pass on chemo... Also, it has gone well, so don't worry... the worst thing is the unknown.  It won't be nearly as bad as you are imagining.  I know you will make the right decision for you. Good Luck with your decision!  HARLEY",
