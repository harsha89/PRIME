Visited the surgeon on Jan 3rd, and Plastic surgeron on Jan 4th.  Had a mastectomy on Jan16th, they found two tumors  one 1.2 cm and the other 2.8cm. Stage 2 Grade 2.  Did not spread to any lymph nodes. Waiting to see the Onco in three weeks to get results of BRCA test to figure out if I need any Chemo or Just Tomoxiflyn (sp wrong).  It is ER+ PR+ and Her2nu-....
