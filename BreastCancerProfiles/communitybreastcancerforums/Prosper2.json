Started on a combo of carboplatin and gemcitabine two days ago. Once a week infusions for two weeks and then a week off. So far I have low level nausea and burping and fatigue. Also they presume a spot on my liver is mets. Alkaline diet mostly continues but I felt so week today had comfort food of a tortilla and cheese and avocado. My cancer has changed from estrogen positive to triple negative. The above study seems a little too complex for me and still at the animal testing stage. Love to all of you out there sailing in this boat.",

I am keeping myself sane while waiting for a path by art, walking, alkaline diet and prozac. Would love to hear from you all with lung mets. Well I have been on Femara for 8 months and my cancer has returned. I never had surgery and responded the first time really well to Taxotere infusion and Xeloda combo. My latest symptom is a swelling and tenderness (I swear there is pain with cancer) on my Left breast which now after a week of identifying has become a lump (not at site of original (no surgery) tumor). I discontinued the Femora and my hip and joint pain is disappearing. I still have mid back pain and difficulty breathing- metz to lungs and last week they took out 490 cc of fluid (which had developed over a 5 week period) from my left lung with thorocentesis. I am encouraged to note all the different medications that have been used to keep us all alive over the years and hope I am a candidate for a clinical trial in the Bay area- if not I kept the port in for 8 months (with monthly heparin flush) for a reason. Trying to stay positive but the choices assault the senses until I have a path. Anyone got some advice?",
