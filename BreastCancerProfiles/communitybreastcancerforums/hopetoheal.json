My mom is diagnosed with IV stage, liver met bc.She took the first chemo and next week she will take the second. After the second one, they will control her and if the tumor on liver heals, they will make surgery to take the breast. After surgery, she will take chemo, radio, and so on. She is %30 ER +, PR- and HER+ She is only 46 and I have a 11 year old sister. I am very stressfull and wanted to hear the story if somebody has the similar experience. Thank you for your replies.

We kept talking on Turkish and I saw the preciousness of her heart and soul.She didn't complain even one time although she very much had side affects of the chemos. I told her about my mum and she let me know about herself. We became sisters. I am so happy that God let me meet her on this web site. She gave me the inspiration to thank God for all the situations on this world.She reminded me this is a temporary world and all things we are living are parts of a big exam for the entrance to heaven. I saw her strenght and thankfulness to God although she was 27 and battling a stupid enemy. I really like this girl from my heart and pray god to ease her victory at this battle of her. Nilüfer, you are my sister on the other end of the world .Remember we had plans that you will come to Turkey after your treatment ends.I will make you meet with my mum, another victorious like you! And will eat baklava of course ! :) ",

After pet scan, they saw it is a 1,8 cm tumor.That is she is stage 4. They made biopsy to understand whether it has same receptors with the one in breast. They were the same, so the chemo began. After 3 dose of herceptin, it is 0,8 cm now :) After the tumor on liver heals, they willl make surgery to take the breast. Please don't be scared. It heals even if it is a tumor, but it may be irrelevant with tumor because liver takes everythinng to its memory, even a childhood  age kick.",
