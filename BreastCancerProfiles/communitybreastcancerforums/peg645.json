Significant family history - on my father's side, but also my oldest sister's daughters - both dx at 37, and next oldest sister last year at 68. My mother has no history, nor does oldest sister. No BRCA found when my nieces were tested. I live in a rural area, but just outside a town renowned for its hospital system, extended in dozens of area small communities. Just had first meeting w/ the surgeon Friday, and it was then I learned this tiny tumor - just .6cm - found only in a 6 month mammogram - is aggressive. I sure know what Her2 means now, and am shuddering at the cost of Herceptin. My current work contract expires in a month - which is when I plan on having surgery (lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy) and beginning additional treatment. Am scared it will be very hard now to find new work. But that's to worry about later. My niece has a recurrence currently, and lives outside Boston so goes to Dana Farber. Since I haven't had my surgery yet, the things I know (doesn't seem I have enough info for this board's diagnosis) are still limited. But my local surgeon has a treatment outline created. It has been strongly suggested by my niece and sister that I get a second opinion. I agree it doesn't hurt to have one, and get additional info - and having family in Boston and Dana Farber being a cancer center - makes sense. So, foolish question - when? Before the surgery I'm guessing... Should I travel, or is sharing the info enough to start? Is it very typical? Next oldest sister lives in the south, had a second opinion at Johns Hopkins where they used a 3d mammogram and found an additional tumor. My local surgeon is getting me set up for an MRI to check for the same. Appreciate any and all advice and experiences. I am frankly numb that I have this - am pretty healthy and active, and really ticked off that after this winter, I can't just enjoy the summer. ;-) But glad it has been found at this point. Thanks again. Dx 5/2015, IDC, Right, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 3, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jun 1, 2015 04:55AM - edited Jun 1, 2015 04:55AM by peg645 Thanks, ispy and Sjacobs. Yes, have read about tumor boards online, but that wasn't mentioned at the local hospital. Wondered how that works. And good to know I can call the cancer center direct - I was asking my niece about a referral to Dana Farber, but once I confirm it's ok w/ the insurance company, I'll just call them myself. She has enough on her plate. Current treatment outline is just the lumpectomy for surgery, as my surgeon says it appears it makes little difference if you do the masectomy or lumpectomy. But reading just through the histories on this board, as well as seeing how the diagnoses change, who knows what I'll end up doing? This was just a \"tiny\" tumor so I was sure that meant probably lumpectomy and maybe radiation, and boom - start looking for work again. Aha. But after the Her2 discovery, and being told I'd need Herceptin and chemo and radiation probably...it has been overwhelming. While I'm feeling great physically, I'm seeing months of illnesses and issues on the horizon. But the \"future\" is starting to balance out a bit reading the boards.",

Have so much up in the air, also, with the hoped work contract renewal teetering. May be out of work on June 30 afterall...until the next contract. For now, surgery for a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy scheduled early July locally. Looking forward to hearing the opinions of those at Dana Farber. Am very anxious to know the suggested treatment plan - and how much time I would lose from work down the road - my job requires long hours, and little else is available to me - unless I travel considerably - and that doesn't fit either... However, was buoyed by a call from my local hospital from a nurse coordinator. It's the first they've had someone call me who finally seems to be overseeing what is expected. They had previous appts planned for me that weren't made at first - I inquired and pushed a few times for my med records for the 2nd opinion. A friend of my sister's gave me a good name \"inside\" to inquire of, and, coincidence or not, I finally got a call from someone who appears may be helping keep things together. Thought I'd learned enough life lessons. Think I'll be picking up several more... Wish me luck.",

But still working crazy hours, and, of course, trying to work through plans. And, then keep forgetting my laptop cable when I'm away during the week at work! I have just picked up a tablet finally - figure it's about time and know I'll be online A LOT in the near future. ;-) I have been in touch w/ Dana Farber and expect to hear tomorrow when I'm scheduled to see them. Have already requested med records be faxed, and images saved to a CD. With my niece in Boston, and my sister buying a place near there, it might even be where I go for treatment. Agree, I'd like to hear what they think of my local hospital's plan, but it may very well be an option. Am just so thankful for the opinions specific to my case. I have confidence in my local surgeon - she is general, but does the majority of breast/oncology surgery at the hospital. What has me a bit concerned is some dropping the ball support staff wise. Just keeping an open mind and learning as much as I can. Good news - I think - after everyone has been applying to jobs for the last several weeks, they told us today they are hoping to keep us on another 4 months. And after that if willing to travel. So my fear of losing employment is at least put to the side for now. Will know for sure tomorrow. No disability with this contract job - but the pay rate is excellent. I have just mentioned to a supervisor today that if we are renewed July 1, that I will be needing some time off for some health issues. Don't plan on details unless any course of meds will make things obvious. Feeling much better about things after a week. And the words above have meant alot. And hoping to learn much more from all of you. When not working (and my battery is charged!) I'm more often online and involved. Thank you all for the responses. I will keep you posted.",

Had thought about divulging more after the 2nd opinion, then thought twice about it. The contract is for my entire company, but there are many of us so my being missed doesn't really matter. Just to me. ;-) Only relies on big hiring company's eventual decision. Can keep the insurance through Cobra, but am close to 1 year so really hoping to be able to stay employed through that date at least for other benefits. Have been promised work elsewhere if not renewed, again requiring a temporary change of location. So really hoping to stay put. Would be much easier. Thanks for the hugs. ",

Will be having double mastectomies now due to gene issue. Will not be having radiation. \"Other than the cancer\", I'm in great health... Am an at will employee in a high-paying temporary contract job - over 55 hrs/week, but desk work, not terribly stressful other than the long hours. They are asking if I will be moving with them in the fall. I am 61. Obviously my health comes first. I have been told I may very well be able to work during chemo. But what are your experiences with time off for double mastectomies? And overall time for reconstruction, etc.? Is there a \"typical\" recovery time? Best case scenarios? Have read flap recovery/procedures involved longer than implants, but even so, think I prefer the former. I believe they are trying to work with me, but it is a big company with need now - as do I need the income. Very few options for any other work. I am just trying to get some kind of general best - worst times I can expect to be away. When I find descriptions - such as even on this site, they will say things like \"up to 4 weeks; up to 6 weeks\". Then my smart alec niece brags about doing her toenails the next day. She's no help. ;-) Thanks to all! Dx 5/2015, IDC, Right, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 3, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
