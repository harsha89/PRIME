So far I have taken Tomixifin , Femara, & injections of Fasaladex. My doctor put me on Afinitor of which I had side effects of sores in my mouth & a rash on the back of my neck, which turned out to be strep infection which went into my blood. I was hospitalized for 7 days & given strong antibiotics for 17 days After I was free of the infection my oncologist talked me into taking the Afinitor again, going down from 7.5 mg to 2.5 mg. I've been taking 2.5 mg for 2 weeks now & the strep is back on my neck. Have an appointment with my infectious disease doctor on Monday. I hope it doesn't go into my blood again while waiting to see the doctor. All of you who are doing hormonal therapy, can you tell me what drugs you are taking. My doctor seems to be at a loss of what to put me on! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
