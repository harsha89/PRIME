She will be resting for a while for recovery so maybe a throw blanket for the living room. I also think it would be nice to send puzzles or games or reading material. How about a fruit basket so she has healthy snacks like edible arrangements.  I wish you and your mom the best. My mom went through the same thing she had a unilateral mastectomy and then 30 years later they found a new cancer in the other breast. This is what made it easy for me to take my healthy breast instead of jsut the cancer one. She was nervous but after said that this time the surgery was way easier.  She was back to her same old self in 2 weeks.",

I am just beginning my journey on October 6th and I already can;t wait for it to be over.  I am getting 4 treatments of TC 3 weeks apart. Just got back from my another chemo opinion. This place was good too. Doctor was very nice and reassuring. They both say since I am healthy I should do well. The difference between the two is this:  Place A automatically gives you the neulasta shot the day after chemo and they have kind of dividers between the chemo chairs with a curtain if you want privacy. But I am also checking into another one of their locations that the same doctor goes to.  Place B only gives neulasta if you need, they have you come in once a week to monitor blood counts. They have an open room for treatment but they also have a few private rooms you could use, and they have wifi which would really make the time fly and I could get work done.  Any opinions? ",

I was planning on a lumpectomy but then had an MRI and it showed they needed to remove 7cm and even with a DD breast that would not leave much left. So my decision was sort of made for me on that. I decided to take the other breast on my own. I just did not want to deal with this ever again and i figured the symmetry would be better for me. I just did what I thought would be the least amount of times under the knife for me even though I still need reconstruction. Also my Braca was negative but my mom had a MX 30 years ago and just had the other one done about 6 months ago. My question always is even though the survival for lumpectomy and MX are the same they don't tell you how many surgeries were involved for each woman.  I think there are two things to think about. Most importantly which one makes you feel safer and then which one cosmetically are you ok with.  I called The American Cancer Society and they have a program called reach for recovery where you can talk to women who had this done. That may help you as well it did for me. All that being said if it wasn't for that darn MRI I would have had a lumpectomy  . . .  but in the back of my mind was thinking is this enough?",

They did not find anything in the pathology of the good boob. I also did not want to worry about doing this ever again. My mom had a MX 30 years ago and then got it in the other boob last year. I don't know if i feel any better really because you could still get it on your chest even if you have a bmx, granted severely less likely. I think it was easier for me to make the decision too because i did not like the idea of having two different boobs or trying to match a natural breast to an implant, seemed like the symmetry would be better with two implants. Plus sexually I was never into the nipple thing. My husband joked that when I get my new nipples he could play all he wants and I could take a nap lol. It's odd though when I get chilled I still get a phantom nipple feeling. Now that i jsut finished chemo 3 or 4 I am looking forward to having boobs again. Although i sort of enjoyed this sort of ballerina type  figure for a while I still feel deformed underneath. When i first got the surgery I was soooo afraid to see what it l would look like and was pretty releived actually, did not look as bad as I imagined. I look really thin without my DDs. So i will be more than happy with a large C when it's all done and my hsuabnd wants to take me on vacation to Key West, where we were married, when it's over to celebrate.  That cannot come soon enough. I think I will walk on the beach and cry for hours just to be there.",

About 2 years after he died we realized mom was not taking care of herself and got her into an assisted living home in Port Charlotte Florida on the west coast. Since then mom got her second run in with breast cancer after 30 years, had her second mx, we are thinking it was many years since her last mamogram I think she jsut stopped getting them after a while. She never had any radiation or chemo but this time they put her on aridimex. Later we discovered she had lymphoma which showed up as these awful sores on her face, and she had radiation on her face which was awful. I was diagnosed in June and my last visit was right before that on mother's day. I have not told her I got BC I probably wont. These days she is unclear what is going on a lot of the time. She forgets things. I figure no need to upset her. Hopefully I can go see her this winter after all my recon is over. Treatment in KC and any medical attention has been very different from Long Island. I was so used to having trouble getting appointments and sitting in waiting rooms forever, and then getting the bums rush through my appointment. Now I get a lot more attention, I can usually get appointments pretty quickly except for some of the specialists who take medicaid, and the docotrs are willing to sit and talk and answer all my questions most of the time.",

Get good shoes with good arch support that fit properly or inserts. If you google it you can find all kinds if things to help with it. I do stretching exercises with a ball that really helps. I thought that I got this because I work in retail and I am on my feet a lot but now that I am reading your post I think maybe it's that plus the fact that I had chemo, maybe also the Tamoxifen I am taking. Good news is it can go away, bad news is it takes a few months and it can flare up again if you wear the wrong shoes. Go to a good shoe store and get your feet measured to be sure your in the right size, I was wearing mine too tight.  anyone else have this?",

SOme people use latisse you need a script for it. I use mary kay lash and  brow serum pm me if you want some. It wont make them grow but makes the ones you have stronger.",

I have heard from a  few women that they work very well. I on the other hand was concerned that if the hair didn't fall out perhaps my head was not getting the full benefit of the chemo. I also really have trouble tolerating cold. I did not read any studies on this though. I had a very very unethical pushy salesman try to get my to buy them by scaring me and telling me I had a 95% chance that my hair would not come back, which really upset me as you can imagine and was totally untrue in any way. As soon as I hung up the phone I read the drug companies reports but was still very afraid. Needles to say hair came back, and fast same as it was.",

I had pink extensions put in but just got them out a few days ago. I was blonde from a mega amount of hilighting pre BC but went back to my natural brunette and a bit of grey. this is me right before i was diagnosed 3 years ago.  Here is my timeline. I took lots of pics cause it helped me to see how fast it was really growing. I think a little bit faster than many but not crazy. I really did not go topless until about 6 months. I might have done it sooner but it was only just getting really hot out at that point.  This is me now.  I hope this gives some perspective to those of you still dealing with the emotions associated with losing your hair on top of losing one or both breasts. There is a light on the other side of the tunnel. It will get better. Be brave sisters. We are all in this together. You are not alone. You are all beautiful.",

I was lucky though it grew in pretty even on it's own except the very top which has always been thin on me. It really is back to the way it was for the most part except its all new and healthy like a little girl. I had a tiny bit more wave at first which i didnt even notice ntil it started to grow out. Now I can see the ends have a little more curl like a perm growing out. But it's all back. Chemo feels like a very distant memory now, almost like it happened to someone else.

I had shoulder length hair that i hilighted blnde for years and I miss it. I dyed my hair with a semi permanent color once then let it go. As it grew longer it did not look as grey. My husband says they grey looks like hilites. He does miss my long blonde hair though. He is happy now that I am past the friar tuck look though. I do intend to grow my hair long again and probably hilite it again, maybe not as blonde as it was. At 46 i def look younger with the long blonde hair. I do get compliments on the short hair though. It is really getting to an awkward stage in the growth now. I am going to have to go to a good salon for advise on how to style and cut this as it grows. I think in a month or so I will have a mullet so def don't want that, not a good look at any age,",

I guess when it starts to fall out I will be moved to take action.  I dunno should I get a short haircut first? Maybe just shorter than it is? Seems like a waste to go to the salon if it's gonna fall out in a few weeks. I don't do much to my hair now. I only wash and blow dry every 2 to 3 days. The rest of the time I just pin up the top for volume. Seems like short hair would be more trouble to style. My hair now is already and has always been kind of thin. It was curly when I was younger and got straighter as I got older. Who knows what it will look like after chemo. I do have some grey now but it's camoflauged by my highlights. More of the unknown with all this. I feel like I need a plan. ",

Now I try to look at the silver lining that the new ones will be like a 20 year old. In the mean time I am trying to enjoy the ballerina figure I have now. There are many types of clothing I could not wear before that I can now. But what i see when I look down is a little scary and I do mourn losing what I once thought was my best feature. I am looking forward to reconstruction but dreading having to have surgery again. My hair had never been a favorite part of me. It's very thin. But i always thought I  looked terrible in short hair.  Better get over that one. I am a little nervous that I do not have a plan in place for what to do about the hair falling out but I don't think I can bare to cut it short no less shave it until i have to. so the plan is no plan right now. I think. or maybe i  will make an appointment with  my hairdresser to shave me and style my wigs for day 14 . . .  sigh!",

I got some cute ones at target, kind of page boy, some knit caps with a brim. I found I looked good in them, even got hit on in a bar once. Here is a pic of me in one of my hats from last winter. I was 95% bald under there and completely flat chested because when my BS did my bmx the recon was done later. But I still managed to hang on to who I was and no one treated me any differently. Take some time to mourn your hair then move on. Get up every day and do what you can to feel good about yourself. You will come to find so many things about yourself during this time, so many wonderful attributes that go way beyond appearance. When your hair grows back you will be so happy but you will realize how much more you really are.   you can see the hair at my temples a little those are the strands that never fell out. ",

If I turn it under I look like Dorothy Hamel, leave it curly and I am kind of like Felicity, and I'd rather be Farrah lol.   I took biotin after I finished chemo. My MO told me not to bother with it until after I finished treatment. There is not much you can do while in treatment when your killing those cells that make hair grow. But as soon as my last treatment was done I started biotin and the nioxin shampoo.  I did use a clear nail polish with calcium in it during treatment. I think that may have helped my nails. I put a fresh coat on before each treatment. rockym I had a semi perm color to cover the grey done when I was at 4 months I felt the same way. it was so dark to me, especially when I was blonde before.  My boss said I looked like Betty Boop lol. It looked a lot less grey as it grew in so I left it.",

But I don't think I can get away with only trimming the back cause the ends are frizzy all over including my bangs. I need to cut off a little bit kind of everywhere.  Today is the day first real cut. I am thinking maybe take off as much as a half inch, Yikes!!! ",

But now it's fine. I don't know if it's working or not though. I am 10 weeks PFC. I have hair growing all over my head now but I can still see my scalp. My doctor does not say to use it or not because it is not FDA approved. I got it because the ladies on here had said they used it. But I have also read some people like the rogaine better.  I also started on tamoxifen 2 weeks ago and my doctor says that should not affect my hair but i have heard some people say they think it does on here.

For the past 10 years or so I had hilighted my hair from dark brown to anywhere from dirty blonde to a golden blonde in summer. I always loved my dad's silvery almost meatllic grey hair. He used the greasy kids stuff every day so it looked black, but when he went to the barber and got it cut and blown dry it was a beautiful shiny silver. My husband was super fair and blonde and his hair turned a very pretty white with blonde throughout. He flet it aged him at 47 to be so white but he got over it when everyone told him how much they like it. After chemo my natural color seemed very grey, as it got longer it got a bit darker. I have about 5% very shiny silver grey streaks just in the front now. So I kind of like it although it does age me. At 45 pre BC I was passing for maybe 38 or so, mostly because of my high voice and young mannerisms. Now I feel like I look 47 and no one seems surprised anymore when I say my age. So for now I am living with it. I am going to go to a good salon and ask the stylist how to maintain my hair while I let it grow long again. I think I will probably hold off coloring it for a while or if I do perhaps a semi permanent so i can let it wash out again.",

I figures it's 4 days out of his life, he can be there for me. He was fine actually. he joked around a lot, we talked about business. We both got antsy waiting the 5 hours, but  we brought the laptop and they had wifi. But when the doctor came in to talk about what to expect etc he did not listen and zones out and waits for me to tell him everything later. Then again he does that at his own appointments to the doctor too. When I was not feeling well he encouraged me to not give in to it. He pushed me to go out and live my life and not sit in front of the TV all day. But there were some days I could not and I could see he felt bad but that did not make him any more helpful. he still expected me to cook dinner and clean up, well cook dinner anyway, he could care less if things are clean. Now it is my second surgery. he doesn't even ask me how i feel. The first couple of days he was texting me from work and i was so miserable with this cough and sinus thing that i got right after surgery. He would stop and get take out every night rather than food shop and cook. If he went to a store he wold ask if i need anything and if i did and they did not have it at that store he would not go somewhere else to get it. I asked for jello twice, I finally found a box when i was feeling better and made it myself. In some ways his atittude keeps me pushing to get on with life and stops me from feeling bad for myself. But the little girl in me really longs for someone to just hold me and take care of me and let me cry when i feel sad.",

With all the great treatments we are able to get today it is so sad that we still lose some of our beautiful sisters to this cancer. Reminds us of how far we still have to go to beat this thing.  mimi That is terrible the way you were treated at your biopsy. I can't believe they would be so insensitive. After my biopsy they did not say anything just wait for the results for two days. I was hoping it was nothing but still very scared and teary. Immeidately after they hooked me up with a nurse navigator to explain everything to me and to just talk. I spent a lot of time talking to her and crying and she walked with me down the elevator to the parking lot to eb sure I was ok to drive home. I ended up having to go to a different hospital to do my surgery and they had the same kind of support system there. Lots of people to talk to just to talk or ask questions and be my advocate. I feel so lucky to have had these women help me. I hope I can give back and help someone else some day that way.",

I wonder if it would make me look to flat though. How long does your hair need to be? I have posted my hair progress on here before and I agree it does help to see the growth if you take pictures and compare how far you have come. I started at 4 weeks PFC when I figured the chemo was done and the hair should start even if I could not really see it. Otherwise I was staring at my head in the mirror non stop hoping to see it sprout. I also took pics when I got my TEs. Never took a pic after my bmx of my unreconstructed mess I guess I couldn't but I know my PS did take a pic in the hospital right before surgery and I was thinking of asking him for it. I am going to print out the booby progress chart and bring it to show him. Might be helpful.",

I think if it was summer during that time for me I could have gone topless, but it was cold so kept wearing my heavy knit hats i had gotten used to. Nw at i think 7 months I have what looks like a normal curly haircut. Not my taste but it's growing. I am afraid to cut it. I trimmed the back twice early on so that it would not look like a mullet. I want it to get longer to weigh down the curl.  Now I had it colored in the salon about 8 weeks ago with a redken semi permanent. I am very tight on money now so I need to color this myself this time. I have never colored my hair myself so I am nervous. I just want to cover the grey. I am brunette. I was thinking of going to Sallys and asking them what to get and how to do it. Any advise on hair colors, brands, technique is appreciated. ",

I went to 2nd location of one of my doctors today and liked it the best I think. It's very small just 5 rooms no big open room, very private. They have two nurses that work there. This is the doctor that does give the neulasta shot routinely with TC. I spoke to the nurse about it and she said it really is important to the effectiveness of treatment because it prevents any delays. I had not thought of that. If you have to delay a treatment it does affect if how well the chemo works. Plus they have wifi. So I am just going to let this sink in and make sure this is what I want then cancel the other appointment on monday.",

It all came back same as it was before chemo. everyone thought I should post this because for some of us the hair growth came back fine and people without gorwth issues probably don't post as often. I had 4 tx of TC. My hair fell out at 18 days. I had full coverage in 4 months like GI Jane and a cute short look by 6 months. It's now 3 years and it's longer than I think I have ever let it grow. The texture is the same as it was before except I am not hilighting it to death so maybe a little healthier. But basically I am right back to what I had before. I enver had any weird fuzz or white hair it came back jsut like a baby's hair grows it seems. My lashes and brows did not fall out jsut thinned a little bit. I barely noticed until they came back. My nails had some ridges and a little peeling underneath nothing anyone would notice. I kept clear polish with calcium on them through the whole process. I used Mary Kay lash and brow serum to keep them looking thicker. I started taking biotin immediately after my last treatment and using nioxin shampoo. I hope this is encouraging news for anyone getting scared.",

I think this is pretty much the wave I had before chemo. it's hard to tell because it always curled up more when it was shorter or layered. I was wearing it all one length down to my shoulders before, not even any layers so that the ends would look thicker. I always had very fine hair, and the ends would get straggley.  I don't think it's thicker now but I do feel like I have more of it somehow. You can't tell in the pics but there is a lot of grey in there too. I colored it once months ago with a semi permanent and then did not want to spend the money.  I do take 5,000 mcg of biotin every day so that may be helping, and I use nioxin shampoo and conditioner. I was using the nioxin scalp treatment but now that the hair is coming in pretty good i stopped.  I'll keep posting pics for you all as it comes in. I know I found it helpful to see pics of the regrowth when my hair came out.  ",

Ok I have had a request from kathy to post my hair chart again. So here it goes. I think this is the way my hair would have been pre chemo had I cut it short and not hi lited it until it was all blonde lol.  But it was always a little wavy.  and here are pics of me now   ",

So my folic acid was $5.49 and that was free.  I had a hairdresser once years ago, tell me to use something called nuhair and i notice it has b complex, biotin, and folic acid in it.  So there might be something to it. I took pics yesterday of my tales of the crypt head so I can compare as time goes on and see if i see progress. Going on a road trip monday and  I will be gone 17 days i hope to see progress when i get back but that will be about 7 weeks PFC so might take a while longer.

I saw lots of really pretty dressy things you can put in your hair at target. They have these very thin double strands of pearls on a headband, and thin black one that had an embroidered leaf. As far as scarves go silk looks very dressy.I like when the scarf is really long that you can hang it in the front over your shoulder. Also you can wear a big pin on the scarf.  It all depends on how you coordinate it with what you are wearing. I go for the more casual thing myself, don't have any occaision to dress up more than put on some big earrings really.  Also I recall some really cute retro looks that can be sort of dressy, like from Gidget's time.  I was thinking if you did the whole matchy thing with a bandana that matched the collar on a dress and matching shoes and bag and cat eye sunglasses, convertible optional. Hope I got your creative juices flowing. ",

But the thing that is really bugging me is the thin spot on back of my head that always looks like a just woke up no matter what i do to it. I am thinking of using the rogaine on that spot but i don't want to be a slave to it, I am afraid what will happen if I stop using it. Christine here is an update to my progress chart. It has only been three weeks but looks really different to me.    You can see how my hair is curling now. I don't do anything to it except a little styling paste. I have not gone out topless or with a little headband a few times this week when the weather was very warm.  I went to a doctor appointment today with a new ENT to check on a sore that keeps coming and going in my throat. Anyway she asked what i did for a living and when i told her i used to be an art director (unemployed now) she said oh yeah you look artsy lol. So i guess it's a look  . . .",

I only cut it short, not this short, once in my 20s I got a shag. I hated it. After that I always had at leas shoulder length hair. Thanks for all the encouraging words from everyone on my hair. I still am not ready to go topless. You can't tell so much in the pictures but there is a lot of grey in there. My husband keeps teasing me. He is all 99% grey and has been since he was about 35 we are 46 now. I think I will dye it as soon as I can but i never colored my hair myself. I think when I am at 16 weeks which is 2 more weeks, I will get it shaped a bit. I still have these slightly longer hairs from the ones that never fell out. Also i have hair growing on the back of my neck that should be shaved into a shape. KCMOM my surgery date to get my TEs is March 29th. I am very nervous but excited at the same time. It wasn't supposed to be until April or May but they got a cancelation. I went to Saint Lukes and had a consultation there, where they showed me the expanders and implants and explained it all to me which was good. He was going to see if they could take my medicaid but i doubt it. For me this symbolizes the beginning of the end or this ordeal.  My sister is flying up from Key west to be with me for a week. I really want her here more for moral support than anything else. ",

I actually started taking folic acid because my gynocologist recommended it 2 years ago. I had HPV and then a mild dysplasia. I had a leep procedure done which omitted the dysplasia but from what i understand HPV does not go away. 80% of all sexually active women have HPV and if left untreated can lead to cervical cancer. But it is very detectable in pap smears so usually caught very early. My gyno felt that the folic acid would fight the HPV. Who knows what is right. I am thinking maybe i should stop taking it until more conclusive evidence is in favor of it. My onco has it in the list of things i am taking and never told me not to take it.

This is a tough journey and getting everything back to normal helps to put it in the past. I do suggest to everyone to take pics even if you do not post them it helps to watch the progress once a month or so instead of staring in the mirror every day.  saralmom I think my hair is a bit shorter than yours it's just poufy lol.  I matte it down with product to make it more spikey instead of round like an afro.",

But when my hair started to grow back 4 weeks PFC those long hairs started to break off and i had this layer of hair that was an inch longer than the rest. I went to the hair salon at 15 weeks and had it all evened out. I am at almost 20 weeks now. I have full coverage but there is one spot at the top of the back of my head that seems a little bit thinner than the rest, not bad though. I could go without a hat now i think but i am so used to the hat now i feel naked and cold without it. My inlaws are coming for a visit in 2 weeks and I wanted to get my hair colored but having trouble getting an appointment. I have never colored my hair before so I am afraid to try it myself.",

I had some hair that was really long that never fell out during chemo so it was longer than all the new growth. So I had my hairdresser trim that so it was all even and he cut some around my ears and trimmed and buzzed the back of my neck. Now I am at 20 weeks and the back of my neck is a bit longer and curling up a little and the hair is growing over my ears very slightly. I was thinking of getting another trim but decided to just let it grow now.I am starting to look a bit like a vulcan on star trek lol so i am going to try to let this grow out asap. I have still been wearing hats 24/7. It's been chilly in KC but when it warms up I will have to rethink this. I really want to get it colored but my hairdresser is booked, i guess with easter and mothers day so close. I know he has had a customer who had chemo that has been coming to him for many years so i would like to stick with him. Plus i have no idea where else to go.",

My natural color was a dark brown  and my dark parts look black. besides the fact that I hate myself in short hair no less this military short, i have hair that grows on the back of my neck. I had it trimmed in the salon but it all grew back pretty quick. So this short look is not going to work very well for me. I just had surgery so i can't even reach much over my head right now but i don't think i could reach that to trim it myself anyway. I am trying to make the best of it but i really hate it and miss my long hair. ",

I was heart broken at first but then I picked myself up and got a ton of cute hats, and a few wigs, and lots of amkeup and earrings, and jsut had fun with it. I even got hit on in a bar once. I looked at the whole hair loss as a do over, to get all new healthy hair again. My new hair is much thicker than the baby fine stuff I had before BC. I also enoyed not having to wash and style every day. Throwing on a hat is way easier. I wore hats most of the time even though I had 3 nice wigs. I  wasn't working, well working some at home, but I put my wig on when I went put once in a while. It was winter so I needed a warm hat anyway. I would think you summer gals probabaly need sun hats now anyway. I also wore bandanas to the gym. I recommend the Look Good Feel Better Program. They will give you a big bag of great makeup for free and show you how to use it all, with some great scarf tricks too. Good luck to you don't let it get you down. Keep stressing the positive. You are killing the cancer and your hair will grow back.",

I think if the headband as the substitue for the hats i was wearing although i did get a straw fedora and i have some cotton hats for summer, I don't like baseball caps on me. I hope when it gets a little longer the weight will weigh down the curl some. I like your analogy to the pony tail. I can't do anything to my hair yet to straighten it i think it's too short yet. I went to beauty brands and they used to have a really small flat iron by baby bliss that she said i could get online. I did buy some more nioxin but the kind of color treated hair now. I also got a smoothing cream from nioxin that helps with the pouf. I have a fill today so I will take pics of that and my hair later. ",

I hope when all of this is over for me I can volounteer and help other women some how and I was thinking these charts might be helpful. I use the Nioxin 3 step products. I did not start until 3 weeks PFC. It's about 7 months now.

Takes me about 15 minutes and then I mostly just sue hairspray to hold it but I just started using some morrocan oil on my bangs to keep some of the frizz down. As far as color goes I don't know if you can tell I ahve a bit of grey seems mostly on my bangs. I decided not to color it anymore at least until it's down to my shoulders then I might go blonde again. we'll see. Here are pics of me before all this.

You don't need much obviously when you are bald. They gave me a 5 oz sample that last all through my treatments. The 3 weeks PFC i siwtched to Nioxin 3 step treatment. It's a little irritating. The scalp treatment turned my head a little red for an hour or so after using it. Plus i really think taking biotin helps hair growth and strengthens nails.  I had 3 wigs that I wore each one maybe once or twice. I work knit hats the 24/7 until about 6 months PFC. It took about 4 weeks before I could see in a magnifying mirror tiny sprouts coming in. I will post new pics of my hair growth soon. Just not up to it now, still have a sore throat from my last surgery. ",

We did not get any free hats scarves or wigs although you can get them from ACS. There are lots of free hats and things you can get free i think there is a thread here called Freebies that lists websites where they will send them to you. I am somewhat financially challenged right now. So many people and organizations have helped me through this.  I am so grateful and hope to be able to give back in some way when I am all done with this.",

I used Brian Joseph shampoo on my head during chemo, it's a local company in KC but they sell it online too. Then I used nioxin i think it was level 2, 3 part shampoo conditioner and scalp treatment, 3 weeks after my last chemo. NOw i use my regular shampoo. I started to take 5,000 mcg of biotin, folic acid and b complex 3 weeks after my last chemo. Plus I take a multi and vitamin D plus calcium. I think my hiar pretty much always grew pretty fast. I had a tough time with color regrowth when I was hilighting it blonde. Everyone's hair grows at a different rate. But no matter how fast it grows it always seems soooo slow. I stared at myself in the mirror every day waiting for the sprouts to just pop out and cover my head. I recommend you all take pics of your head once a month, even if  you never post them, just for yourself, and then you will be able to clearly see the progress and you will feel more at ease. Ocotber 5th was one year since i started chemo. I had 4 tx of TC 3 weeks apart. ",

I hope this is encouraging to those who are earlier on in the process than I am.  I just took these pics after taking a nap so it's a little flat. I blow dry my hair every day to smooth out the curls because I don't like the poodle look on me. I only shampoo every other day though to keep it from drying out even though it only takes 5 minutes to blow dry it with a round brush. Then I use a little gel and hair spray to hold it. It's hard to tell in the pics but there is quite a bit of grey running through it, it's way more noticeable in person. I kind of like the grey looks like hilites. OK so here I am today at 51 weeks PFC.       And here is the chart I made from 4 months to 8 months PFC to show you all how far I ahve come.  ",

I see so many celebrities talking about their breast cancer but they always leave out the visual parts like losing a breast or hair loss. It's hard for me to look at someone who had a lumpectomy and radiation and think they had a tough time when I had a bmx and chemo. During my chemo I shared my experiences with other women on BCO and I saw how they did not let this stop their lives. I saw many of them work full time, missing only minimal days for treatment, only giving in to feeling sick toward the end, and then bouncing right back. I am proud of the way I handled all of this. I look at as a huge accomplishment to have survived this, like climbing the tallest mountain.  Your hair and lashes and brows will come back. This is all temporary. Use this time of not having to style your hair to focus on all the other wonderful beautiful parts of you.",

I lost 23 pounds 2 years ago right before diagnosis and kept it off through my bmx and chemo but when everything was all over and I started working I eventually stopped doing the program and gained all the weight back and then some. So I was 30 pounds over, lost about 5 on my own then another 6.2 on program with about 20 more to go now. I want to lose it all before my surgery on oct 30th but I am only losing a pound a week so I will only lose another 10 pounds at this pace. So I will need to lose another 10 after my surgery.

I am due for another cut now. My bangs are all grown out past my chin now and I decided I want them back and more layers back. It is pretty traumatic for me to go to the salon though. My ends are a little crunchy now not sure why, possibly leftover from the chemo, more likely from blow drying it every day.

I stayed away from curling irons but now I see the curls help disguise the damaged ends. so i just curl the ends so that it's not straight and straw like. I get brown overall color with carmel hilites to cover the grey. I have been very gradually cutting my bangs. My stylist keeps persuading me to keep them long. So this is me I take biotin every day since chemo ended and I used nioxin the first 6 months and recently tarted the nioxin again because the top of my head was always thin. I've also gained some weight. I can't blame it on anything but my own gluttony but i do suspect tamoxifen is making it harder. I am getting ready to go to NY to see family and friends and i just got a bad case of acid reflux which I thought I left behind with all of this and stop the protonix so back on the pills.

It was over $1,000 which I could not afford and I also thought that it might inhibit the effectiveness of the treatment so that made the final decision. I was really mad that the salesman was pressuring me to do this though. It was really unethical. He kept telling me I better decide right away and have this all overnighted which was a fortune in shipping too.  That being said I have a friend who used them and it worked for her. Losing my hair was really hard though, even though I never had great hair. But actually now my hair  is much nicer, so I kind of got a do over. I was prepared for how long it would take to grow back.

Right under my bangs in the front I have like frizzy baby hair, the rest is long and blows out nicely. So not sure if it's dead ends cause I have never trimmed it or dry from blow drying every day. I don't shampoo every day. So I got two things I like but I still think I need a trim. First I got Beyond Zone smooth criminal blow out balm $7.49. It helps with teh flyaways and make smy hiar feel really soft. Then I got one n only argan oil hiar spray $9.49, which I think is less drying than the fructis stuff I was using and seems to add a little shine, but the hold is not as stiff as I am used to, more of a combable hold which I am getting used to. I am thinking I still need to get a trim ugh the thught of cutting anything off is awful. But I want to grow it long and I want it to be super healthy so I can make it blonde again. Any comments or suggestions from our hair experts is appreciated.",

I am a former Long Island Girl so much like Jersey Girls I think.  It's day 24 since my surgery and I have been cracking up watching NJ housewives and then I find you guys. I have lived in KC for almost 2 years now. I was diagnosed on June 23rd with no medical insurance. I spent a week trying to get medicaid in place which was hell but since then everyone has been amazing. People are just really nice here on all levels, at least to your face lol. I am trying to be a nicer person too. I was sent to a learning hospital (Truman Medical Center) which has been great. I saw many medical students, interns, and fellows but all those visits were followed up by my surgeon. It was nice i felt like I had lots of people caring for me. I met with my onocologist twice who is a fellow but each visit the head of the department also visited with me. I also made an appointment to get a second opinion with another oncologist at a different hospital oce the test results are in.   Thanks for sharing your experiences it is really helping me to prepare for whatever treatment is ahead for me. ",

I want to have everything I might need on hand and duplicates so some things to keep in my car. I work at home but I want to be able to go out and run errands if I need to. I hope my counts don't keep me stuck home. I also worry about what to do for 5 hours during treatment I like the idea of bringing movies. I ma making my husband sit with me the first time but seems like it would be ok after that to just let him drop me off then pick me up at the end.

Each time i got it i used the nystatin swish and swallow and it pretty much would go away. But i did get it with each chemo. This last chemo had sores on the roof of my mouth and tonisls and the thrush was worse. My throat was sore. I used salt water gargles almost every hour for two weeks and my throat feels better now. My tongue was still white though. My doc then called in diflucan and i have taken three of the 5 pills now. Still my tongue is white.
