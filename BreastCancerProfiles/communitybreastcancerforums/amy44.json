If you seach the website you can find this: \"Following treatment, the most common side effects are redness, bruising and discomfort. These do not occur in all patients and are typical side effects associated with any type of radiation therapy.\"  For me, Day 1, the insertion was easy but the pain was significant. Day 2, an adjustment relieved most of the intense pain. Days 3 - 10 were uncomfortable, but not terrible. The breast was sore and I had to protect it from being inadvertentily bumped.   The actual radiation pulses were tolerable, but the tubes pulling on the breast tissue were mildly miserable. After day 4, the breast tissue was red and hot and I felt like I was burning from the inside out.  The RO insisted on the full treatment plan, and I felt like I had to agree in order to have the catheter removed. So here I am 3 weeks post radiation. The redness and bruising have disippaited, but the \"discomfort\" continues. I stiil feel like I am burning on the inside. My breast is achy, tender and sore. When I move my arm there's a pulling sensation, and I have a big old hard lump.  The short stabbing pains don't bother me too much b/c I know that's the nerves repairing themselves. But I wonder when this \"discomfort\" will end and my breast will stop shouting at me with the \"hey, I haven't forgotten what you did to me kind of pain\".  diagnosis 1/2012, DCIS, 1-2cm, stage 0, grade2-3, ER-/PR-",
