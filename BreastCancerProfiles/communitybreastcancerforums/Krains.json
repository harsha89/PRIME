      "Content": "Krains wrote: I found a lump in my right breast nearly 2 years ago and was sent to a surgeon who decided to do a FNA. I was told that it was most likely a Fibroadenoma and that it would be monitored every six months. Well, at my last visit, I was told that it was measuring larger than before, but the radiologist said it could've just been \u201cthe way she measured it.\" I was told that if it's bigger at my next appointment (which is actually tomorrow), she would do a core needle biopsy. I was a little concerned and decided to request the results of my FNA which said that 45 ml of cloudy fluid was obtained. This is very concerning because I know for a fact that there wasn't one drop of fluid in the syringe when he did my FNA and my cousin who was in the room even said she's not sure what the surgeon put on the slide since the syringe was empty. Has anyone else experienced this? Log in to post a reply",

I just wonder if my results were mixed up with someone else\u2019s since there was clearly no fluid aspirated from my breast. Luckily, I have a follow-up tomorrow and I\u2019m just going to request a core needle biopsy to be sure. My radiologist has said before that she wishes the surgeon would\u2019ve done that two years ago.",
