Anybody here familiar with this Dx? I'm scheduled for excision on March 8 and they need to place a \"seed\" a day or two before the surgery. I would like to ask of anybody here had an experience with seed? I read it's radioactive. Is it safe for me to be around my 2 y/o? Thank you. Best, Grace Log in to post a reply",
