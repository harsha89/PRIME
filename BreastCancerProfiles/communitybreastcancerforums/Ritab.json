BTW, I ordered a parking pass for the reduced rate ($30) when I registered for the conference, but we decided to take the megabus, so I will not need it.  Is therre anyone who could use it??  I am thinking that it is already paid for--even if it is not, I will pay for it because I know the committee had to know ahead of time to purchase them.  Better to have an extra than to have none!!   I hope someone else can use it. Do you have someone matching people up for roommates if they need one?",
