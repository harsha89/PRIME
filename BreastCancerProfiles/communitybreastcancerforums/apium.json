I received radiation and chemotherapy again. Two months after finishing a rigorous regimen of chemotherapy, I began experiencing rib, sternum and lower back pain. The cancer was spreading rapidly; the smallest movement became painful. My new regimen included narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics plus hormonal therapy. Yet I was never free of pain as I tried to adjust the narcotics dosage, sleeping most of the day while waiting for my body to respond. Constipation, another side effect of narcotics, also required special attention. As an activist with Breast Cancer Action, I have learned how to find new, cutting-edge treatments for breast cancer. And so I began reading medical literature and talking to people. I remembered attending a conference several months before and picking up a pamphlet on Strontium 89 (SR-89; brand name Metastron R ) and its effect on painful bone metastasis. Friends searched Med-Line for articles related to SR-89. The pain specialist with whom I had been working was less than enthusiastic about the potential of SR-89. He felt that information on Strontium was more anecdotal than based on solid science. My oncologist admitted having no knowledge about SR-89 and referred me to a radiologist who was treating patients with SR-89. My thoughts and feelings were mixed: Why was I presenting information to specialists about pain relief? Why is so little known about the use of SR-89 in the clinical area? One answer may be that SR-89 is administered through the radiology department rather than through the oncology department. It has been six weeks since I have had my first injection of SR-89. My quality of life is improved: I can take care of myself, drive a car, and do the things I enjoy most. I no longer require narcotics for pain relief. No person should have pain, especially since there is an FDA-approved treatment that might help. I hope the following information on SR-89 will be helpful to those seeking pain relief from bone metastases. What SR-89 is and how it works Strontium 89 (SR-89; is a calcium analogue (a substance that acts like calcium in the body), one of several systemic radiation therapies that offer safe, effective relief of painful bone metastases. it works by binding to multiple tumor sites within the bone where it is retained. SR89 is a pure beta emitter electron with a maximum range of radiation of 8 mm, suggesting that it has minimal effect on nearby soft tissue. SR-89 has been approved in Canada, Europe and most recently in the United States for relief of pain associated with bone metastases. It is comarketed by Amersham International and Zeneca Pharmaceutical Groups. SR-89 is given intravenously and is almost completely absorbed or eliminated within a week after administration. Since it binds rapidly to tumor sites, usually within one week, bone metastases that develop after the first week may not benefit from its activity. One study showed that SR-89 adhered to osteoblastic tumor areas (areas where bone is repairing itself) and remains in those areas longer than in normal bone. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Precautions for patients Two-thirds of SR-89 is excreted in the urine and one-third in the feces. Special precautions include: flushing the toilet twice after using, wiping up any spilled urine immediately and flushing it away, washing hands thoroughly as well as any linen or clothes that have come in contact with urine. Since SR-89 is known to have a very low energy release, contact with other people carries no risk for radiation exposure. Possible side effects Published studies using SR-89 with approximately 500 patients who had painful metastatic bone disease showed a 77% response rate and improved quality of life. Two-thirds of those who responded to SR-89 became pain free. A brief temporary increase in bone pain was experienced by 10-20% of patients within 48 hours after administration of SR-89; this is called a transient flare, and is self-limiting and controllable by analgesics. Researchers think that those who do experience an initial flare of bone pain generally have more effective pain relief over time. SR-89 is given intravenously for 1-2 minutes. The standard dose is 3060 mCi/Kg. A response is usually observed within 10-14 days following administration. Previous studies have reported few side effects; however thrombocytopenia (a decrease in the number of platelets which reduces the blood's clotting ability) and a decrease in white blood cells may occur 5-6 weeks after SR-89 has been administered. It is suggested that the platelet count be greater than 60,000 and the white blood count greater than 2400 before SR-89 is given. One study suggests that SR-89 might have some effect on decreasing disease progression but further evidence is needed to verify this finding. Some questions remain The typical time between injections SR-89 is three months since SR-89 remains at the metastatic bone site for at least 100 days before it begins to disintegrate. However, this time can vary, depending on symptoms experienced by the patient, side effects, response to the first treatment, quality of life, and the expectations of the patient and the physician. The overall cost of SR-89 as revealed in a trans-Canadian trial was much less than standard treatment that might include prolonged hospitalizations, more radiation therapy, outpatient appointments and additional medications. A savings of approximately $1700 was shown when SR-89 was used, compared to a placebo group in which the cost was 60% higher. Although this data is retrospective and included only a small number of patients, it suggests that there could be a significant savings for people treated with SR-89. It is not clear how many times a patient can be successfully re-treated with SR-89. However, it appears to be a safe, effective treatment for people living with painful bone metastasis. We hope it can play a greater role as an adjuvant therapy for women living with breast cancer and for other patients with cancer that has spread to their bones. If painful boney metastases are affecting you or someone you love and you think that SR89 might be a useful therapy, please feel free to share this article with your physician. Being your own advocate could make a real difference in the quality of your life.
