Just saw my breast specialist and oncologist today and they suggested that chemo will be best for me before having an operation.my lump measures 20 mm or 2 cm and they want to shrink it first.they have reassured me that this is the best option as chemo will also kill cancer cells that are roaming around my body as well.the oncologist also mentioned about avastin the drug that is on trial for early stage breast cancer,im not sure if i will go with the trial as i dont know if it will be beneficial for me.im getting scared of the side effects of chemo. hopefully everything will be ok.i trust in the lord,he will take care of me.",
