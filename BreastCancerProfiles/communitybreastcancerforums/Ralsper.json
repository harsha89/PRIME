Apparently, neutropenia can occur on Tamoxifen but it is \"rare\".   I don't know how long after chemo our counts can be down and I don't know whether rads can cause counts to go down. Seems like if the rads are focused on the breast, they wouldn't affect bone marrow; but I guess the ribs and sternum and maybe the collarbone could be in the field. How much functional bone marrow is in those bones, though?  I guess it's possible to have an indirect effect of rads (due to the soft tissue damage) mess up WBC production by the bone marrow. Never heard of that, though. OTOH, some websites say rads for BC can cause neutropenia. Anyway, I am so looking foward to hear from other women.",

My RO asked me: \"Are you comfortable?\"... \"Am I supposed to be comfortable?\" I answered, I don't think anyone is comfortable in that position and I was in a terrible mood. He finally correct himself and asked: \"Are you in pain?\". Then he suggested that my TE should be removed, so my skin doesn't get too damage. Well, I had this conversation with my PS 8 months ago, so if the TE does not interfere with the main purpose of the radiation and my RO wants it removed for cosmetic reasons, he should discussed it with my PS as I asked him to do it 2 months ago!!! Anyway, he finally called my PS and he said that he prefers not to remove my TE and I trusted his opinion completely. I will have 25 rads and no boost since my RO said that there is no evidence that after a mastectomy the outcome will be different and he wants to prevent more damage and SE's. Definitely, I need to work with my treatment and not against it, so I better get in a better mood before my first rad, which will be sometime next week. Keep positive!",

I never expected my skin burning so bad that it will look like a piece of paper lighted by a match... I never imagine my body will ooze so bad that my arm will be \"glued\" to my torso every morning. When I read other women talking about peeling and wounds, I never really imagine how bad it looks...Peeling is more like loosing chunks of skin with flesh attached... I look like a survivor after a nuclear attack! I was really never prepared for this, although they told me it was going to happen. I do have severe burns under my arm (sentinal node scar) and under the breast. So bad, that all of the skin has come off in these areas. They are now open and pink and I'm just waiting for them to heal. Using wound wash, domeboro soaks, and silvadene. I pray this all clears up soon-- under my arm is the worst as it's a big open, pink area about 6 inches across. Blech. The RO's say that this is ok and will just take time to heal. It has been one week since I finished radiation and these burns didn't happen until right up to the last week of treatment. I am all set to HEAL now. I was \"ordered\" to do one week of bed rest, arm elevated on the back of the couch as much as possible (but the muscles of my arm, chest and back are a mess for having the arm elevated all the time and it hurts. Also nobody told me that could happen). I just want this burn gone for good. So I am home, braless, drying my skin with a fan, and I am not going anywhere for awhile. Let the healing begin!",

I had the same questions and they explained that the latest studies showed the benefits of radiation to prevent local recurrence and bla, bla, bla... Anyway, I asked my MO how many scans or studies they will do after rads and she said: \"If you want I can order a Tumor Marker, but you have to believe that you are cancer free. You have been doing everything that it is available to cure your cancer and be healthy...  You can keep worrying everyday or move on with your life\". Well, I have found that it is easy to say than do. My MO said that you HAD cancer after surgery, which is the \"cure\", and the chemo and rads are just \"preventive\". By the way, the \"blue bump\" that I have under my scar is a blood vessel (?????).",

As I mention my RO said that I will have just 25 and no boost since after mastectomy there is not data proving that boosts does reduce local recurrence, because it will be impossible to know where to target and it will further damage the skin (when they do lumpectomy, they know exactly where to target the boost). My RO actually joked saying that the only one that beneficiates is the RO because he will be paid for another week. A friend's RO said mastectomy scars are where most recurrences happen and she will put up with the boosts on her scar. Any comments or thoughts?",

I think I am doing great, but it looks awful tho'! I am naked most of the day and keep applying aloe vera. Aquaphore and emu oil make my skin hotter and red (??????) My armpit however is a mess, it looks something like the Gran Canyon, it has all kind of deep open sores where the skin has peel away, it hurts all the time. You can see the expose red meat of my armpit, even the techs said \"ow ow ow ow\" when I have to lift my arm . I am applying lycodine and I began to take pain killers as well. I am keeping my arm elevated with a fan circulating air and it's helping, the problem is when I get the armpit wet while showering the wounds open up again.This is going to be a loooooong weekend!",

I am not red, but you can see that I am getting tan. I notice a tiny little \"bump\" (like a pimple) on my arm pit. It doesn't look like a blister, but I touched so much that now I am sore ;-(   I will talk with the nurse tomorrow. So far no pain, rash, nor swelling, but my RO said that it's too soon (?????). Today, when I was leaving the treatment room wearing my gown, I ran into a ex-coworker that has been working as an interpreter in the center where I am been treated. I ran back and hide behind the \"super thick door\"... I really panic... It was really uncomfortable to walk half-naked in front of someone that knew you when you looked 10 years younger and healthy (me 6 months ago). Anyway, I have to said that the techs  were wonderful, they helped me \"hide\" until he was gone and they will change my appointments to make sure I don't run into him anymore and protect my privacy.",
