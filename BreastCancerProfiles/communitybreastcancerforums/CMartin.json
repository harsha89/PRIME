      "Content": "CMartin wrote: I am a type 1 diabetic recently diagnosed with DCIS in the left breast.  I had a lumpectomy with two spots and no clear margins.  That was my first ever surgery, not difficult and didn't present any significant challenges regarding blood sugar.  With no clear margins a UMX was suggested immediately.  After much consideration at the age of 45 I opted for BMX.  That was my second ever surgery.   What I have found very surprising in all of the research that my husband and I have done is that there is very little written about being a diabetic and the challenges associated with it.  I am relatively healthy, average weight, good BMI, exercise and eat relatively healthy.  My average A1C is 7. My surgery was on a Monday.  Immediately my insulin requirements almost doubled.  I am in week 4 and the dosages and blood sugars are just now beginning to moderate.  I contracted a fever (but no infection) and a rash from the extra antibiotic given for the fever.  All in all, the largest challenges have been associated with the diabetes, not the BMX.  If anyone is reading and needs insight I'm willing to offer what little I have but would ask that if any of you are challenged in the same way to write more about it.  Cindy Martin Dx 4/2012, DCIS, 2cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Surgery 4/13/2012 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel; Mastectomy: Left; Prophylactic mastectomy: Right Surgery 5/21/2012 Lymph node removal: Left; Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Surgery 8/24/2012 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Log in to post a reply",
