Port to be implanted next week with first round of chemo immeadiately following.  Problem is she is so, so very weak.  She has highly aggressive cancer, but very receptive to chemo.  I'm wondering if she can even handle the chemo because she is just so weak.  Is this weakness normal and can she bounce back after the chemo?  Any comments greatly appreciated.
