Was told they will be throwing everything in the book at this fast growing cancer. Have additional testing to do still bone scan etc... does the Onc do this or set up at initial mtg? My main concern is the breast now looks sunburnt and one of the tumors has developed a sharp edge and it feels like it may break thru the skin. Is there anything I can do to prevent that? I posted a lot more details on the newly diagnosed; help I'm scared post. Trying to be poositive but I feel like there is so much I just do not know ...   Thanks and good day.   Jeanee",
