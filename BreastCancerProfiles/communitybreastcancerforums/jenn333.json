In your shoes, I would not let enlarged nodes and these other issues just sit for 3 months.  I'd be asking for a core biopsy of the nodules you know about and a definitive finding on what's going on with the nodes.  Then when you have the results of the biopsy and whatever tests they can do on the nodes, I'd push for an MRI post haste.  Trust your gut. Don't mean to scare you but I think you have a couple of significant red flags that you need to rule out. Good luck! ",

FYI Hoag is not an integrated center like UCLA.  The doctors just have privileges at the hospital but have offices elsewhere.  I was planning on being treated at Hoag (loved the breast surgeon) but could not find an in-network plastic surgeon to do my DIEP, hence my self-referral to UCLA.  Glad it worked out that way as it happens.  UCLA, with its multidisciplinary team, provides much more coordinated care than the patchwork team you have to put together yourself at facilities such as Hoag.  I can't speak highly enough of my UCLA experience (and this is from someone who hates LA with a passion). Hope this helps.  Feel free to PM me with any questions. Jenn",

I just didn't see the point in telling her before I had solid information to share about my prognosis, etc. She's a worrier and would have given herself a migraine. My daughter is only 7 so I told her I had to have an operation on my chest. I have previously had two hip resurfacing surgeries so surgery is not scary for her. I didn't have to have chemo though. Obviously that's a whole other conversation because she would have noticed the side effects, naturally. As it is, she's pretty much oblivious to it all.
