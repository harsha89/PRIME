      "Content": "sunshine123 wrote: I got horrible news today. Last year I had DCIS and a bilateral mast. In April 2007 I had reconstructive surgery, and my p/s found a nodule of IDC. I started chemo (DD A/C) 2 weeks ago, which was to be followed by DD Taxol and radiation. Last week I noticed a new nodule, and went to my surgeon to have it biopsied. My surgeon called me today...the nodule is positive for more IDC. I got a recurrence in spite of being on chemo, which is unbelievable. I'm going back in on Wed (6/6) for a wider excision because the margins weren't clear this time. And my oncologist is planning to do radiation between A/C and Taxol rather than saving radiation for last. I can't believe this is happening. I am SO discouraged/angry/overwhelmed/scared. Please help me get through this! sarah www.mytropicofcancer.wordpress.com Log in to post a reply",
