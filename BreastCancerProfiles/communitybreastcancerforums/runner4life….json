I think I was pretty extreme but the point is, this whole experience is hard enough, why make it any harder? It was my experience that the person making your plan for your general treatment and then again for your boost at the end seems to be the most important piece.  ",

      "Content": "Jan 8, 2009 11:16PM - edited Jan 8, 2009 11:27PM by runner4life I look better bald/with a short crew cut!  Who knew?!?  I was in chemo from mid August to the end of September.  My husband shaved it on 9/15.  It is funny now to think how sad I was at the thought of losing my hair back in June and July when I was trying to get over the shock of my diagnoses.  When the time came, I could never even put the wig on... I found out I am just not a wig person.  I wore ball caps when I wanted to blend.  After about 3 weeks of being bald, it just didn't bother me anymore. The only time I went out and found myself regretting not having a hat was a trip to the mall after my eyebrows and eyelashes fell out in the middle of October.  That turned heads in a way that made me uncomfortable. Now in January, I am almost 4 months out from the night we shaved it and am finally at the point where nobody assumes cancer anymore.  I have a little buzz cut and still love getting out of the shower and just toweling off my head off.  It actually makes me feel chic and kind of sexy!  I was walking into a store in the end of December and overheard a woman tell her husband, \"See now SHE has one of those cute short hair cuts\"- if she only knew!    Part of me wants to keep it short but the other part of me can't look at this short doo without thinking about the last 7 months and wants to grow it back to just put this behind me... I guess as if having my old hair might make me feel normal again. I will never look at being bald the same way again.  We are all wiser, stronger, and more beautiful because we made/are making this journey.    ",
