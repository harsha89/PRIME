I've been buying my hair products from Vitacost which is an online natural health store with really good prices. They have shampoos for gray hair that are free of the toxic chemicals that are commonly in hair products. Since being diagnosed with cancer I'm being a whole lot more careful about make-up, lotions, and hair products, especially avoiding parabens and phthalates that might contribute to cancer growth. I've actually found the healthy products are not too expensive and the results are great.  I haven't had a haircut yet. I use a hair gel called Giovanni All-Natural Magnetic Attraction Hair Styling Gel after I wash and condition my hair. Then I comb the entire top portion forward and the back and sides down. Next I let it dry on its own. As it dries it becomes wavy and curly. After it's completely dry, I very gently use my fingers or a pick to style it. Be gentle and do not use a comb or brush because it will remove some of the curl and you'll lose the curly effect and you might look like you have cotton ball hair :-/.  Notbuyingit - I'm so sorry you ended up coloring your hair. I tried a temporary  color on my hair when it was almost an inch long and I really didn't like how it looked. I kept it in for 30 minutes which was suppose to make the color stay - but instead it ALL washed out. So I knew then my hair would be difficult to color. I read on another board that someone's hair turned almost a purple tint when they tried coloring it on their own. Maybe yours will wash/fade out quickly, otherwise I hope your hairdresser can help you out. Since I had never had very short hair and I'd been keeping my hair light brown before cancer - It's really been hard adjusting to all this. Hang in there, it get's better.  Donnabelle - I'm glad to hear your curl has lasted. My hair has always had some wave to it but not this curly. I'm hoping that it stays. I can't imagine what mine will look like months from now. I hope to avoid cutting it. My hair is also super curly in the back!  Maybe if you try the gel, you can style your hair in a way you'll like. Birdlady222 - maybe the gel will help you as well. I never could find a wig I liked so I wore scarves last Fall then switched mostly to caps in the Winter, as a result I learned some stylish Israeli hair scarf tying techniques and how to crochet hats to match my outfits. I'm certain you can give up your wig soon. March 28th was when I stopped wearing anything on my head. It was really hard, but since so many people encouraged me, I managed to move forward and it's gotten much easier with time.",

I'm not sure this will happen to you, but when my new hair came in, the old hair then fell out which was a little disturbing at first but it ended up being fine. Again, I'm so thankful that I didn't shave my head because I've read of so many negative results from doing so such as the hair feeling prickly when it grows back. When mine grew back, it was so very soft, like a newborn's hair. I even had my grandchildren and other family members feel it because it was so special and unique. :-) ",

I didn't want gray hair, I thought I was too young for that. But I've now realized that it's our culture, the media, and the all businesses that make a lot of money on hair products that made me feel depressed and not confident in my own natural looks. About six months ago, to help me cope, I started a private Pinterest board with pictures of women with gray hair. I had to \"change my mind\" about how I viewed gray hair. This went on for months, an obsession that I'm almost embarrassed about. But it was a remedy for me.I needed to see beauty and youth in gray hair. I only found \"The Gray Hair Project\" recently, yet I'm very thankful for it as it's a great encouragement for us! Here's the link again.

I work with a woman who is post menopausal and she's never had cancer, chemo, or been on hormonal therapy and her hair is extremely thin all over. There are other reasons women have hair thinning and your doctor should be ruling those out if he hasn't already. For example thyroid problems can cause hair loss.",

So what I did after that time was I used a little gel when my hair was wet and I combed the top down and forward, then when it dried, I moved some of the top over to the side. I have a short forehead and square face so I'm trying to show more forehead rather than cover with bangs. Have fun with trying a new hair style each week as your hair gets longer! ",

It's definitely been hard having short, curly, gray hair when I was use to longer light brown hair that I straightened with the blow drier. My hair is still a work in progress as it gets longer and the color chages. I have no idea what it may look like a month, 6 months, or a year from now. As it gets longer I've found that using a hair brush makes it stick out and straighten in away I can't stand. Thankfully, the natural gel I'm using helps keep the curl in place. My hair is also getting a little less gray with a few light browns. The wonderful part about all of this is that my hair is so much easier to care for and my scalp no longer itches.  Notbuyingit - Lago gave great advice about make-up. I've found that just a little make-up can really enhance your natural features and give you a beautiful look with short hair. I don't wear a lot of make up, but my eyebrows thinned so much that I've found the eyebrow pencil really helps, and wearing a lighter shade of lip color looks good. I found helpful sites online that give make-up tips for women our age. With the wedding coming up, I suggest you try on your dress, make-up, and style your hair. Take a picture with the wig and another without the wig and perhaps this will help you decide what to do. I'm sure you'll look beautiful either way!  DiabloMom - you look great! I didn't lose all my hair, but did loose enough that I wore scarves and caps. I never felt comfortable in a wig. Lisa - you're looking great! Mine came in a lot like yours. My dark line was a little over to the side. It's getting darker as it grows out. Time will tell if your hair stays straight or gets curly.  MinusTwo - my hair came in white and black, and it was light brown only starting to gray on the sides before chemo. But I'm now seeing some light brown hair coming in.  Birdlady222 - Seems your hair is coming back like mine did. A few weeks ago I posted a larger picture and information about working with the curls. It took me a while to adjust to my \"new look\" but as time has passed, I've become happy with it.   Lago - you always look great - thanks for all your encouragement. slv58 - your hair looks great! Months ago I would look at your picture and wonder - maybe my hair will be like that. I really wanted straight hair, but curly isn't too bad.  naiviv - thanks for sharing your hair color adventure. When my hair was about an inch long, I put a temporary color on that was the same color as my hair before chemo. The color looked good and it covered all the gray but I didn't look good at all. The color no longer looked ok next to my skin color. So I knew then that it wasn't the hair color that was really bothering me. Then after allowing the color to stay in for 30 minutes, I rinsed my hair with water and ALL the color came out!!! I was glad and I also knew then that my hair was very resistant to hair color. Annie - that's great about your hair!!! Sunshower - you are looking great! Really shows, like many of the pictures others have posted, that a pretty face looks good no matter how long or what color one's hair is. All these different scenarios show that we have no idea how our hair will turn out until it happens. It's helped me to see this life changing experience as a brave adventure to make the most of!",

Then I use a large toothed comb through my hair and I avoid touching my hair until it is dry. Then I use my fingers to reposition it on top. I add a little water and or gel if needed. On the day after this treatment, I just add a little water to my hair to get it back into the style I like. I wash my hair every over day.",

It's been over a year since surgery and all has gone amazingly well. Thankfully, I have a very kind, supportive husband, excellent doctors, and supportive friends.  I hope and pray your surgery and recovery goes well.  Mikesgirl17 - your hair is looking great!  By looking at all the different pictures of hair growing back it's obvious not every one gets \"chemo white\" and \"chemo curls\" - we are all different. A friend of mine who is a year older than me (59yrs) has dark brown straight hair coming in whereas mine is much different. Here I am 10 months PFC with hair as long as it was before starting chemo. You can't tell in the picture, but the back is getting long enough that I can make a little bun and pin it up. I'd been wanting a new hair style for a very long time and God gave me one! ",
