I knew day 3 and 4 would be the worst, I knew it would take about a week to feel reasonably normal. I would recommend liquids, liquids, liquids....I think some nausea can actually be prevented by staying hydrated. Hopefully by the time your next chemo rolls around you will be feeing better, if you have any questions you're welcome to PM me.  As I understand it chemo is the best treatment for triple negative.....so try to hang in there, just take a day (or hour) at a time and be kind to yourself, good luck.",

It was a long day (about 5 hours), but it went really smooth.  Some of the time delay was due to the chemo area being one nurse short today (my nurse said this may happen again due to summer events, vacations, etc.). First I had my blood counts done, which were fine.  Then I met with my oncologist.  Earlier this week I had an EKG and MUGA test (no reason just a check after finishing AC).  Both tests came back good, there was no change in the MUGA test from the inital test prior to chemo. On to chemo, I was given my premeds.....the steroids and Benadryl have to be infused separately . (they also gave me a nurse call button for today's cycle since it was a new med.) When the Benadryl started I started feeling fairly anxious (I did not expect this) so, as instructed called the nurse over, we discussed it.......could it be anticipation, would I want to take something, wait and see, etc..  She was very calming, we decided to just monitor it, eventually it went away (I think it was anticipation).  Then the Taxol was started (very slowly),  I really didn't feel anything (at one point I felt the flutter of anxiety, but then it quickly went away.)  After a time, the infusion was sped up, then with no reaction, sped up one more time.  After Taxol, I had my Avastin/placebo infusion and then I was finished. I felt better at the end of this than at the end of my AC infusions. so, now I'm home, I took a nap and ate a good dinner. It's kind of wierd knowing that I haven't had any anti-nausea meds and I feel fine.  I actually feel pretty good. I know that this is only day 1 so we'll have to see how the next few days go but at least I'm off to a good start.  My second cycle will be next Friday, the nurse said it should go much faster (plus I only receive Avasin every 3 weeks now) good luck to all, and thanks for your support",

JenC.......I know everyone is different, but for me....day 3 and day 4 were the worst.....day 4 was slightly better than day 3 and I slept pretty much the entire day.....day 5 when I woke up I knew I felt better and was on the upswing......I fell asleep watching tv in the early evening for the next few days.......now that I'm through one complete cycle I would recommend just going day by day don't worry about the next day (I know easier said than done),  so except for day 3 and 4 all of the other days were pretty good, I did go up and down, having great days and then a couple with more body aches, etc. but even these were not that bad......good luck....... fg2000.......I bought a calendar and am marking meds and SEs for each day.  That way I know what time I took a med., in case I forgot.  I'll be able to compare this 2nd cycle with the 1st.....I have no idea if they will correspond at all.  For my nausea, I asked my nurse and she suggested to keep taking until about day 5......so I took Emend (3 days) and continued with Zofran.  On day 6 I took Zofran when I went to sleep. (the other ladies here had cautioned about getting nausea at night.  That was it for me except for one night when I woke up feeling off, and realized it was probably nausea and took something)  The nurses said suggested that even if you feel fine never go out or be without meds, because if feel bad, you can take them...... sorry to ramble on and on.......thanks so much for all the help you've given me.....good luck to all",

There isn't a support group in my area although there is a program that matches you one on one with someone, but I passed on that, thank goodness the boards are here.  My cancer was found during my yearly mammogram. Triple negative can be scary, I think we are both lucky due to our early diagnonsis and stage.  I actually tend to not read much on the triple neg. board because I found that I didn't get as much positive thoughts as I do here.  I think once someone has made it through all of the treatments and their first couple of years, they tend to not check in as much, so you don't hear about the success stories.  I'm actually glad that after the first couple of years that the reoccurance rate falls, I'd rather worry now while I'm having lots of followup care than later.  I talked to my surgeon a lot about triple negatve and she was honestly very optimistic, she felt this would just be a bump in the road for me.  I told her I really wanted the straight truth, and she said that was exactly what she was giving me (I love my surgeon).  I was tested for the BRCA gene and found out last week that I don't have it.  I'm glad you were so on top of your health and already knew that you had the mutation and took precautionary steps.  Although my family history did not indicate the gene, I really wanted to know so that my daughter would have any info she needed. good luck to all...........",
