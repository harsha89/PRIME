Clavical area looked like it had an irregular rug burn near end of treatments, right where the collar of my work uniform rubs. It bled a little after my last day. Some shallow blisters on skin near sternum. And got a seroma in armpit, it wept fluid but technically wasn't open. 3- No fatigue. 4- Not sure, but I think got a boost first treatment. Received 28 nukings on whole boob, underarm, and clavicle area for the less traditional approach of radiation before surgery. The breast surgeon has very little to work with (I have tiny boobs) so they have to shrink the lump as much as possible first. Something about clear margins. What's nice is that the skin heals really fast after treatment ends. I can't handle petroleum based lotions or things with mineral oil, but the aloe oil (not gel...but actual oil from the plant) I've been using has been super soothing.",

The brain & not forgetting things so easily- that comes back. It's frustrating though until it does! Am only on #17th rad session and have a big, fat, painful seroma under the treated pit. Doc says fluid there built up so easily due to the scar tissue in this area (have an old sailing injury there & near boob, is all messed up) These seroma things usually can happen after surgery and are reabsorbed by the body. Feels like yuk, I feel like this picture I made when my boss wasn't looking at work..  Hold fast, never give up the ship! We WILL prevail!",

Maybe it wants to be a nuclear submarine in its next incarnation. Tessio...Yeah!! You done, no more scary radioactive robot eye circling you. ouch, hope that sensitive skin heals fast! no underarm hair? Like ever? That's kinda cool...hope mine doesn't grow either! Gotta have SOMETHING good out of this. Kate:-) :-) have you peeked at the machine's business end? (I remember you mentioning that you like science fiction too). I kept a straight face while telling a friend that my boob very lightly glows in the dark and that I'm not allowed on airplanes because I'd mess up their instruments. His eyes got real wide and he fell for it until I started laughing. Now he calls me 'nuclear nipple'.",

Gargengirl- you're not alone with Herceptin issues. Rashes and lung problems are bugging me too, boy do I hate this med! I don't even know if it's doing anything useful at this point. I saw a study that showed a year of this medicine made little difference to having six months of it. I'm going to push the \"patient's rights\" button and stop it at six months. Damaged lungs, heart, and who knows what else isn't worth it to me at least. The seroma (not a town in the desert) is shrinking, but skin over it an angry red and sore. Doc prescribed something called 'Silvaden' for me to get and slather on.",

Finished chemo, will have one-boob masectomy soon, then will start radiation some time after surgery this late January or February, Oh joy. No exact date yet... Don't like the idea, but apparently it looks like the reduction in cancer recurrence is greater than the undesirable side effects. So busy working, but will try to visit this super helpful site more often! Cheers!",

Already finished #10 out of 21 zapping wide area; the boob, clavicle, pit area. Like the chemo, they're doing this before surgery. So far notice no effects from radiation yet but some occasional itching and mild inflammation of the target boob. All the nasty effects I'm feeling are from that hated Herceptin. - sore stiff joints (the abrupt estrogen suppression & body struggling to acclimate to that), rashes on my back not related to rads, and on and on. Mean stuff....:-/ Am using aloe oil & penetrex & ASEA gel on the rad treated skin, feels refreshing that odd new-agey combo.",

Loved the conversations about the vitamins and stuff...that is a very confusing area for me and it seems for the docs. Am taking that curcumin though. Kate, keep an eye on that Herceptin and what it's doing. Glad the doc is monitoring its effects so you can pull the plug on it before it gets too damaging. That unpleasant drug has so far lowered my \"LVEF\" by about 11 points. Doc says we can recover from that, but I won't believe it until I see it. You guys are all so great on here! Love you all!! ",
