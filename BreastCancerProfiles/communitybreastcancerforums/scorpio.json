I was lucky, I had a unilateral mastectomy with a reduction on the other side for symmetry, and I one of the ones who is extremely pleased. My p.s.showed me pictures of his work in cases exactly like mine. I was recommended to him by my breast surgeon who works with him all the time. He only does breast reconstruction. Not every plastic surgeon is an expert in breast reconstruction. If you get a good surgeon, you can get a good result. The most important factor, before the technique, is the surgeon. I know not everyone lives in a metropolitan area where they have access to choices, but it might be worth travelling farther to go to someone with a really good reputation. Hope this helps",

Then she said \"basically you're either stage 4 or you're not.\" So I say , but my research on the internet shows that the overall survival rates and recurrence change from 2 to 3. Well, she just pooh-poohed that. I'm here on this forum, cuz I'm trying to decide what kind of treatment to continue with. I have serious issures with a.i's(not just the s.e.s, but the whole rationale) so I thought that going back to tamoxifen would be a good compromise., but since making that decision, I've been on the ever escalting tamoxifen testing ...trans-vag ultra sound leads to endometrial biopsy, leads to dnc, hysteroscopy, polyectomy...now I don't know. If I still thought I was stage 2, I'd stop all hormonals, but a stage 3 perspective is different. I don't know how to think anymore, I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just the comaraderie of stage 3rs,nobody knows what it's like...it's like a fuzzy area, you're not \"early stage\" and you're not stage 4, it's weird. Well, thanks for listening. Scorpio Log in to post a reply",

Does anybody remember when birth control pills first came out..(the original hormone therapy).how heavy the dosages were? A Lot of women couldn't take the pill because of the side effects. Then they (the medical community)figured out that a much lower dosage worked just as well..a \"mini \" pill. Maybe that's the best of both worlds...mini dosage that would produce the protection without the severe side effects. Are we  bc patients really the only people who thought of this?",

They put on a surgical velcro bra on in surgery which I woke up with and wore until the drains came out.So it was the surgical bra and the camisole over that. I had my drains for about2 weeks. I wore a big shirt over the camisole. After that the sports bra with the zip-up front(recommended by my plastic surgeon, I had immediate reconstruction.) I really didn't feel much like going out before the drains came out anyway. I've since  had a final reconstruction, with a reduction on the other side for symmetry.(It sounds as if you are probably the same size as me) I 'm very satisfied with the final result...very youthful. Good Luck with your surgery. Hope this helps Scorpio",
