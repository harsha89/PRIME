I have been having a lot of nausea and acid reflex. Today is the first day I really feel like eating. Has anyone else had that white pasty feeling in mouth? If so what did you do for it? Talked with onco nurse, she said possibly thrush..... See onco tomorrow. Also does anyone have extreme Sensitivity in the feet? Please tell me next round will not be as harsh....... Take care. I love reading all your posts. ;)",
