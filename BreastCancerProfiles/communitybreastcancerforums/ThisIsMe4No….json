As someone mentioned, the dye is injected to highlight the sentinal node and generally an additional few are removed. I had 5 nodes removed in the initial SNB during my BMX and ended having a complete axillary lymph node dissection surgery later when evidence showed the cancer spread... a total of 24 nodes removed. I also had an MRI that showed clear nodes but as my onc said, the most effective way to see cancer is under a microscope. I'm thankful I have yet to experience LE and my heart goes out to you.",

I met with my onocologist today and need to get testing done on the tumor to see the HER2 results. Results on the initial biospy was unequivocal. Once those results come back, they will have a better idea of chemo drugs but I will have a hormone suppressant drug. Had my bilateral mastectomy on December 7th and still recovering. I'm stage II b I'm just a ball of emotions right now. My friends and family have been amazing but I'm just looking to talk with others in my shoes. I know the feeling of being strong and brave in front of people and wanting to cry most other times. I'm definitely anxious and afraid too but this too shall pass. Wig shopping sounds fun! Hope you find some great ones. Despite the less than ideal circumstance, I'm so excited for Christmas and am hopeful that 2017 will bring some good into my life!",

Looks like there are more of us which sucks but more support is great! After my bilateral mastectomies Dec 7th, I had a complete lymph node dissection on 12/28. Results showed 5 additional postive nodes which put me at 7/24 nodes and stage 3. Had a CT scan last week and they saw lesions on my liver. I have another scan sat to confirm if its cancer or benign lesions. I'm hoping for the best. The onc has changed my chemo drugs from AC and taxol to THCP since new results showed HER2 +. I am scheduled for an Echo on Feb 1st, so probably won't start chemo until the 2nd. Hope I can still hang out here. I will have a port placed next week and am bummed. I'm slowly catching up on all the posts but hope everyone is doing as well as can be given our circumstance.",

For my mastectomies, because I decided to do immediate reconstruction, a plastic surgeon was required and there was only 1 plastic surgeon in the area. You would think they would have more. Also, the chemo scheduler was out for the past few days so I couldn't get a firm dates on openings. It's crazy! I managed to get my echo moved to Monday only after telling them I would be willing to travel to other facilities in the area. I realized you have to be proactive in your care. I also hadn't had any surgeries and have only been in the hospital to have my kids. We do have this!! Just keep bugging people until you get what you need!",

Goincrzy- I'm so sorry to hear that this process is taking so long. I was feeling the same way, but decided to bug the crap out of everyone. My last MO visit was the 19th and I had to have a CT, echo and port before I could start chemo, the earliest date for chemo start being 1/27. I got everything scheduld and done this past week after teling the onc nurse to open up other facilities so I can have more flexibility in when I can have these procedures done or else it would have been another week or so. It's very frustrating because you would think they know time is of the essence. Get the number for your MO, the urologist and the onc nurse who should be helping you. Someone is definitely dropping the ball on your care and it's not fair to you. Good luck! Chemo will be soon! Welcome Alffee- Sorry to hear about how youre feeling. I will most likely shave my head this weekend. I feel like I can control my emotions better if i take some control. We'll see how it goes. I'm sure I'll still cry like a baby as it's shaved off. The nurse at the chemo center said she is always surprised at how good people look when their hair comes out and I can't help but think that won't be me. Lol. Oh well. I'll be wearing lots of beanies and head scarves (if I can manged to tie them correctly). Hi Jens74- Congrat on #3 being done. How wonderful! Great to also hear it took less time. Hope you are recovering well! As for me, I had my first chemo session yesterday (1/27) of HTCP. It took 6 hours! But everything went well except for a snag in the beginning. I had my port placed yesterday and it was still quite sore and painful, so it didnt help that it took 2 tries to get IV access. I was in tears! But the nurses were so sweet about it all. I also got a little warning about maintaining and or gaining weight. I lost 8 lbs after the initial diagnosis and surgeries and Im petite. I told them it wasn't on purpose obviously and the stress and recovery was hard. Now I have lots of family and friends pushing food at me. Its sweet but Im hoping they dont get too cared away. I'm feeling pretty well today. Took my anti nausea meds to stay on top of it and lots of water. Hoping for the best in the next week but know the fatigue will start after the steriod wears off. Hope everyone is doing well!",

I don't have neulasta but have zarxio, which i have to inject myself on day 3-5. My sister helped me with it today. Something about giving yourself a shot. Lol.

MKT1- welcome and glad to hear your side effects are being managed well. As for the port, I dont think I would have had one placed if I didnt need the additional year of IV herceptin. I would have just endured the arm poke. Also take into account the lab draws before each treatment. All the pokes add up. My port was placed last thursday and its still uncomfortable. Guess its as much as I can expect with a gagdet that sits under your skin. Lol. As for me, I had a rough last few days. Had a fever of 102.6 on monday and had to spend the evening in the er. My lab work was fine and they think its a viral infection. Then today the GI issues started. Imodium isn't helping much but I'm staying hydrated. Hoping this is the worst of it and it goes away soon.",
