The surface of the mass is rough,pepply almost and feels about 3cm .When looking from above my breast it is slightly swollen in comparison with my other one. My nipple feels slightly shorter on the breast with the mass ,when i did the nipple test the first nipple i could pinch between my fingers no problem,but the other was harder to grip as it seemed shorter. I`m really trying hard to stay grounded and not freak out...but do i need to go to my GP or shall i wait a while to see if it is maybe just a swollen duct or cyst or hormonal?.....could just do with a bit of advice with my next step as this usually very practical,competent woman is wobbling a bit ...thanks for your time :)Â  Log in to post a reply",
