I'm now wishing I would have gone ahead and had the \"girls\" completely removed while I was under. I'll be starting chemo soon, whenever my surgery is healed from the lumpectomy and lymph nodes being removed. I'm a little anxious about chemo, but I know I can do it. After chemo, the \"girls\" will be history!!! I may put them on e-bay or something:) They say that they're very dense, so I'm figure they're pretty dumb---------if dense actually means DUMB :) Good luck to you!!!",

I know you'll do fine. Make sure you have some good reading material or movies to watch. My faith has given me such peace, that I've actually enjoyed my \"down\" time. I pray a special peace for you as well! Penny--I thought having 15 lymph nodes was alot! You had 27?? How has chemo been so far? I know they've improved the treatments tremendously through the years. My 79 year old grandmother went through chemo, and wasn't sick a single time. That's my main fear-----I hate being nauseated!!! I go Tuesday morning to get my port, so I'm hoping to get started with chemo as soon as possible. The sooner they start, the sooner I get back to a normal life again:) Good luck to all and God bless and strengthen each of you!!!!!!!!!!",

I'm 44 years old, went for my yearly check-up and mammogram, and for the first time since I've been havingÂ  mammograms, was called back for a spot magnification and ultrasound. After having that done on 11/14/07, the radiologist was able to tell there was a malignancy in my left breast. I insisted on a biopsy that same day, and it was positive also. I'm very impatient, so I scheduled an appt with an oncologist and surgeon, and had my tumor and 15 lymph nodes removed last Tuesday, 11/20/07. Waiting through the Thanksgiving holidays seemed like FOREVER, but I found out today that all lymph nodes were clear, and the area around the tumor is clear. The only surprise in all of this was the size of the tumor was larger than the ultrasound had shown, so that moved me from a stage 1 to a stage 2. My oncologist has recommended 8 rounds of chemo as soon as I heal from surgery. I'm very anxious, but ready to get this started and over with. My daughter actually came across this website (she's 20). I couldn't make it without her and my husband. Hopefully, through this site I can learn from each of you. I'm totally in the dark. OK.......enough gabbing. God bless and good luck to each of you. I'll take any advice from ANYBODY",
