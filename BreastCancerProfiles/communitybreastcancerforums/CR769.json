      "Content": "Sep 8, 2017 02:25PM - edited Sep 8, 2017 03:56PM by CR769 So I went to the dermatologist this morning. She said it's looking much better. When I told her about the hydrocortisone cream she said that's because I don't need it any more. That's why it burns. ü§¶üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è Told me I absolutely do not have IBC that her cousin had it at 26 and her breast was huge and red, her nipple had discharge and she had a 106 fever. Said I was being crazy. Told me to come back in 2 months. I went in my way still not at ease. While I was at the bank I got a phone call from my primary telling me about my mammogram and u/s results being negative. She also said she called a fabulous dermatologist she wants me to go see and she's going to get me in today. So straight to the new derm I go. She got me right in, took a picture of my breast. Looked at the area under a magnifying glass. Asked me if I had any other pictures. I had one from 9 days ago that was inflamed due to what I thought thought was the cortisone and one I took while Laying in bed last night. She did a punch biopsy in her office and stitched me up. Said from the pic she I took it looks like it's getting better. She said is 95% sure that it's going to come back fine but she wants to be 100% sure. Especially being in the tnf blockers for so long.That's all I want. Is to be 100% sure and not be consumed by this. Once again I thank you all for listening and responding. I appreciate it so much. Praying the biopsy comes in negative",

      "Content": "CR769 wrote: I started a week before 8/8 with extremely itchy breasts. Both on the sides. I scratched and scratched. Woke up one morning and noticed a rash on both my breasts. Left more prominent then right. Right has since gone away. I went a week after the rash began to my primary Nurse Practicioner. Sh saidnit definitely does not look like IBC but wants me to head to my dermatologist that day. Called my dermatologists office and got it in that evening. Of course I start googling and IBC is the 1st thing to come up. Dermatologist gives me hydrocortisone cream and tells me to Wash all of my clothes in free and clear detergent and use the cream one to two times a day. Also asks me if I've ever had a mammogram. (I'm 33 years old with no history of bc, so no!) I do have psoriatic arthritis. A few days later I go to my primary again (the one I previously saw was not my normal one) and show her the rash and question the mammogram comment from my dermatologist and she says it's a fungal infection. Gives me a cream. Says to use that and guarantees it will clear up in a few days. If it doesn't to call her and she will call in something else. It didn't work. She called me in another cream. Took me a week to pick it up as is was over $100. Used the cream about five days and no improvement. Went back to my dermatologist for a two week follow up. Dermatologist was pissed I stopped the hydrocortisone cream and told me to go back on it and see her again in two to three weeks. (It's not itchy so no need for hydrocortisone) she Also said she didn't mean to scare me with mentioning the mammogram but when it comes to the breasts it's always a good idea. (Hydrocortisone cream makes the rash burn as well) I discontinued using it. I needed to go to my primary yesterday to get stitches taken out of a cut I had. Broke down in the Dr office again. She looked at my breast and said she really thinks I have nothing to worry about but she is going to call the diagnostic imagining center to get me in because she sees I'm such an anxiety ridden disaster right now. I had a diagnostic mammogram today and an ultrasound. Both negative. I know IBC doesn't present in either. My breast isn't warm. Nipple is fine. Rash is on the lower portion of my breast and up the sides a bit. Some what like a stretched horseshoe. Some days it seems worse then others. Some days I think it is going to clear up. Yesterday and today it seemed to ache more but not in the same places. (I'm three days past ending my cycle) Like sometimes it's on my right side of the breast. Some times the left. Some times my nipple. Some times nothing. I unfortunately have hurtuism and I have larger pores onmy breast to begin with due to hair follicles. I've fluctuated up and down with my weight my whole life so my breasts are stretch mark ridden and I can't seem to remember what's new and what's old on them. My Dr gave me xanax to control the anxiety I'm suffering from lately. All I can think about is getting sick and leaving my 8 year old daughter. Hoping when I go for another follow up with the dermatologist tomorrow she will agree to a punch biopsy. Log in to post a reply",

I do need to let my Dr. know this feeling of anxiousness and how scared I am even though I got good news. LissaAlissa I will follow her instructions carefully. Being that she is new to me I plan to go in and let her evaluate my psoriasis that's come back midway through my remicade Infusion and see what she recommends. I've just read so much of women who have had one, two, three biopsies until they finally found it. IBC is so aggressive, time is of the essence and it scares me beyond belief to possibly be misdiagnosed.",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2017 08:23AM - edited Sep 8, 2017 08:24AM by CR769 Good Morning Everyone, Thank you for all of your responses. Kicks, I understand your symptoms progressed very quickly. I know that is normally the case. A lot of what I have read progresses like that. I've also read many online stories of women who are going through the same thing I am. Rash that does not go away. Isn't crazy red, not warm. Negative mammogram and u/s. Pain/ache that comes and goes. I've even read some stories where women have had a core biopsy and that was also negative but a few months later rash still hadn't gone away and they did a repeat biopsy and that ended up being positive. Kicks I want to apologize to you because my original post was very scatter brained. I've felt very scatterbrained over all lately. I thank you for how involved you are on this forum, for those those that have been diagnosed and those like myself who are very scared. Integragirl your IBC showed up in an u/s? Was this due to tumors or thickening? LissaAlissa thank you for your input. I may not have 100% confidence in my derm. I have washed everything that touches my breast in free and clear detergent. I have free and clear type lotion directly from my derm and have been using Aveeno to shower in. I take off my bra as soon as I get home. I will explain everything to her properly today. And I will be 100% compliant with her. As I mentioned earlier. I do have psoriatic arthritis. I was put on Remicade in January to control my symptoms. (After being on Humira for 4 years, it stopped working) I was doing wonderfully on the Remicade. Skin had healed. Joints felt great. This past Infusion my psoriasis started again about 4 1/2 weeks into it. I noticed my rash about 5 weeks into it. I am now 9 weeks into my last Infusion. I met with my rhumetologist on the day I was supposed to have my Infusion and explained to her I didn't want to put medication into my body that would suppress my immune system until I know what was going on with my breast. She agreed and said she wouldn't bet her children on it not being IBC but she said it was unlikely. She also mentioned pushing for additional testing is the right thing to do. So off to the derm I go. I will update you when I get home. I know those of you that have been diagnosed probably get frustrated with women like me who are jumping to IBC conclusions. I apologize to you all for that, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening and responding back.",
