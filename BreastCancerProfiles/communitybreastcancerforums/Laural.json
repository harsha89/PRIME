I just broke down and bought some swim forms. I have been very successfully using the bath pouf homemade swim forms mentioned on another thread in the forum. I like how lightweight and quick drying they are and as I sewed them into my regular suit, they never slip or move out of place. I will have to experiment with the new forms.  I got in 15.6 miles of walking this week over 4 days, along with 2 days of P90 Circuit Strength Training. I enjoyed using the River Trail in Louisville where we went for the North American Christian Convention. It was a great week of worship and learning with Christians from all over the country. The cooler weather this weekend has also helped motivate moving. Hope all of you have a great start to the new week today.",

I have been an Honored Hero for the Team in Training group (benefits the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society) over the past 4 years, meeting the runners/walkers at the end of the marathon to pin their special mileage pins onto their ribbons and congratulate them. The Team has walked me through several chemo rounds for myelodysplastic syndrome, raising money for research with each new season. They also supported me through my breast cancer surgery. In fact, in 2011 I gave the Inspiration Dinner speech with my drains still in from my ALD and BMX. My daughter ran the full Marathon that year. This was her note on her Facebook recently: \"Two and a half years ago I started running, largely as a coping mechanism. My mom has had Leukemia for all of my life, and that can be a little stressful. So I started running. Shortly thereafter, I joined Team in Training and started training for my first marathon, raising money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. During that time, we found my mom also had breast cancer. She was just starting treatment when I ran The Columbus Marathon for the first time. She was just well enough to come cheer me on. At the time I thought maybe the breast cancer would be the final chapter. I saw it play out in my head; you fight Leukemia for years, get comfortable and then BAM something else just comes up and kills you from behind. But it didn't happen like that, because this week I get to celebrate with her. This week, my mom is healthy and kickin' A! This week we are both going to complete the Columbus Half-Marathon. Last time at Columbus, I remember the miles getting long and I would count my steps, telling myself that in some irrational way, every step I ran was another breath or day or year that my mom or some child or some handsome man would get to live. This year, every step I run gets to be a celebration of the breaths, days, and years that we have been given. The ones I wasn't sure we would get, but we did. This time, I will run with labored breath, knowing that my mom's breath is also labored, but this time, it's not because her body is messing up. It's because it's working. Still, every step will also be a continued prayer for those who are still fighting for breath. It will be a homage to the fact that I know someday, maybe even soon, my mom will once again struggle to breathe for the old, messed up reasons. My steps are a tribute to the children who are no longer with us. It is to the moms, dads, sons and daughters who didn't get to stay. \"I run for hope. I run to feel. I run for the truth, for all that is real.\" That was my inspiration to join Team this season as a participant. It was a fantastic experience. It does take time (initially just 1 to 2 miles 4 days a week and cross training 2 days a week, but towards the end an hour or so of walking/running 3 days a week, a long Saturday morning walk/run, and those 2 days of cross training). It was a challenge that I needed to accept and it has been a great bonding experience with my Team mates, as well as with my daughter. It has also brought back some confidence and better awareness of my own body and helped me to get past thinking of myself as a cancer survivor, choosing instead to be a thriver. It was well worth the effort. If any of you are interested, you can find more info at http://www.teamintraining.org/",

Even just walking in chest high water can be effective. I do water aerobics. We use foam resistive weights under the water. I worked up slowly to 120% resist weights, but you can get them starting much less resistive to begin with. As with any exercise you have not done for awhile, you will feel tired muscles. I always try to get my compression sleeve back on once out of the water and dry. I have arthritis so am able to do more with the buoyancy of the water than I can on machines on land. Start slow and work up, and watch for any new swelling. Otherwise, enjoy and keep moving.",

She spent a short while moving the fluid from around the incision and it felt so much better afterwards. Just something to keep in mind if any of you have surgeries in the future. Keep your LE specialist on speed dial. Getting stronger everyday, but still waiting on full closure of the incision in order to get back to the pool.

I have used the Solidea sleeve for many years now, and it works the best for me as the sleeve is held in place by a shoulder piece and a half sleeve on the opposite arm. The sleeve is from an Italian company with 23/32 mm compression. Apparently FDA got involved and as it is labeled as \u201cShapewear\u201d, it is no longer being distributed in US or being reimbursed by insurance.

I use the micro Massage gauntlet. The sleeve and gauntlet wear better than most and for my particular swelling, they work the best. Unfortunately, insurance will not reimburse right now, but ordering direct from Italy has cost much less than buying them from companies in the US. I used the micro massage double arm sleeve but it did not give enough compression for me. Hoping that Solidea Italy will be able to come up new Package labeling so they can qualify for FDA approval as compression garments again.",

I also am a survivor of leukemia and have been under treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome for 20 years. I have been the Honored Hero for the Team for several years. As I am at a relatively healthy spot right now, my daughter challenged me to walk the half myself this year. You can see our Team page at pages.teamintraining.org/soh/columbus13/TeamAlway if you want our whole story.  I am finding that I can get by with no sleeve while walking so long as I have time to pump following the walking/cross training. With the heat and humidity lately, the sleeve had to go during the workout. I just finished a 4 mile walk today. Does anyone have any good ideas for sleeves that might be lighter for exercise? I currently use a Solidea Micromassage sleeve alternating with a Solidea compression sleeve. Any input would be appreciated. ",

The P90 uses weights or resistance bands, so I started at 3 lb. and am now up to 8 lbs for 15 reps each of a variety of arm and upper back exercises. I modify the push ups to either just static planks or knee push ups depending on how I feel. Also includes lots of squats and lunge walks which are helpful for the walking. I have done the P90 Cardio as well, but again the original series, not the P90X. I am not the world's fittest person, but am really working towards increasing health. So far, for me, it seems to be working and not aggravating the LE. I do use a LymphaPress daily after I exercise and wear my sleeve all day, except during exercise (I don't have AC, and it is just too warm otherwise). The whole exercise piece is so specific to each person. It seems what works for one person may aggravate another, and vice versa.  Beachbody carries the P90 series, as well as the P90X, Insanity, etc. I have also liked the Project:You series which has 30 minute cardio and 30 min lower body/upper body/ abs routines that have not aggravated my LE. It is certainly a trial and error to find what works. Right after treatment, I used the Lebed video, but then had to move on if I wanted to increase fitness. It is almost 2 years out from my initial surgery. I run a bit anemic due to the myelodysplastic syndrome I have, and I find if I can keep the exercise going, I can tolerate the lower counts better. ",

They are gentle exercises to use to get the lymph system moving and working more functionally. You can purchase the tapes, but it appears that most of the exercises can also be found on youtube now. Many of us have used these at one time or another. Many also wear compression sleeves of some type during the day. There are specific night sleeves that some wear, but I have not had to use these personally. I did use a LymphPress machine for an hour a day for several years, and have recently been able to manage the lymphedema without this. For me, it replaced having to do the self massage for an hour, and I was able to do things at the computer for that hour. Fortunately, my lymphedema seems to be holding right now just using compression during the day and swim aerobics twice a week. Lymphedema takes some time to manage on a daily basis, but it does become more a part of your routine as time goes on. Exercise can be a helpful piece, but should not take you all day. Hang in there...it generally gets easier.",

I am looking forward to getting gel injections in the knees at the end of the month to try to tame the arthritis beast. I finished up PT last week and had my PT measure my arm as I stopped using my hour of LymphaPress in the mornings this summer.

I have continued my twice a week water aerobics and am now back to work for the new school year.

Some new pain meds on board have helped with the knee pain, so although not 100%, I am able to do the job I love fully. I think oncologists have not really explored just how damaging the chemo drugs can be to cartilage and joints. It would be a good research arena in the future. After having a dozen various chemo drugs over the past 28 years, I can attest that they do cause early damage to joints and cartilage. Glennie, Good job on being faithful with the dreadmill.

Arrived back home today to Ohio just in time for more snow. Great to hear of all the adventures and activities you are all trying out in spite of LE. Hate to think we would go through all the treatments and surgery only to give up on new experiences. ",

Looks like about 3 to 4 hours of driving, depending on how the Show Choir does. Does pushing chimes and gongs count as exercise?? Kind of bittersweet though as this is the last Show Choir performance for the year and my daughter is a senior. ",

I have a reaction knee brace which i wear if the knees becomes particularly painful and it has helped a lot. The brace can be worn under clothing as it is rather unusual looking. This is a video clip of the brace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVy6tlcNrMI If you can get some physical therapy, you may find it helpful to get some good exercises to support the knee, as well as look at the best activities for you.

He was not pleased with my stopping the anastrozole, but since going off, I have been able to get off my blood pressure meds and potassium, sleep much better, and have more energy. I am thinking of a visit to the Cancer Treatment Center in Zion soon to get a comprehensive look as I am at the 5 year mark, as well as to have an evaluation of my lymphedema. They are now doing microsurgery, attaching the lymph drainage to the existing nearby blood vessels to create drainage. Sure would be nice to not have to wear compression daily. ",

He noted that right now he is mostly doing surgery from the elbow down to the hand as the lymph system runs more superficial there. As I can control the swelling with daily compression, he recommended just continuing with this approach for now. So back to the swimming pool for 6 hours a week, plus they recommended adding in walking on the off days. Also added phyto-curcumin, Vitamin D3, and B-complex to my regular routine. They did several gene studies and found a CHEK2 deletion and a mutation, an ATM mutation, and 1 other change of unknown significance, which accounts for how I have collected cancers like trading cards over my life. It's good to at least have a reason why, as well as to let my kids know to be tested as well as all are inheritable risk factors for them.

      "Content": "Jul 13, 2018 06:27PM Laural wrote: This is from Aetna's insurance manual. A segmented pneumatic compressor (E0651, E0652) is a device which has multiple outflow ports on the compressor which lead to distinct segments on the appliance which inflate sequentially. A segmented device without calibrated gradient pressure (E0651) is one in which either (a) the same pressure is present in each segment or (b) there is a predetermined pressure gradient in successive segments but no ability to individually set or adjust pressures in each of several segments. In an E0651 device the pressure is usually set by a single control on the distal segment. A segmented device with calibrated gradient pressure (E0652) is characterized by a manual control on at least three outflow ports which can deliver an individually determined pressure to each segmental unit. The fact that the tubing and/or appliance are capable of achieving a pressure gradient does not classify the compressor as E0652 because this is not a calibrated gradient pressure. Segmental gradient pressure pneumatic appliances (E0671-E0673) are appliances/sleeves which are used with a non-segmented pneumatic compressor (E0650) but which achieve a pressure gradient through the design of the tubing and/or air chambers. Pneumatic pumps can consist either of static uni-compartmental pumps where an equal amount of pressure is applied throughout the edematous limb, or a sequential pump which essentially attempts to \"wring out\" the edema by graded compression from distal to proximal. Due to the short cycles of pressure, higher pressures can be applied compared to the static pumps. Pressures higher than the systolic blood pressure are avoided; pressures up to 80 to 90 mm Hg are typical. At this point sequential pumps (such as the Lymphapress or the Wright linear sequential pump) appear to be more commonly used than static pumps. The Lymphapress device is composed of a series of overlapping cells that apply a sequential pattern of compression moving distally to proximally along the affected limb. Using this strategy, higher levels of pressure can be applied compared to other uni-compartmental devices which apply the same degree of pressure along the entire limb. The Lymphapress device seems to be effective in acutely decreasing lymphedema, and many patients have purchased this device for home use. Newer, advanced pneumatic compression devices with additional features that the more \"traditional\" type of pumps do not offer have been developed. A two-stage multichamber programmable pneumatic compression device operates in two separate phases. These devices are proposed to be based on the principles of manual lymph drainage (treat the proximal areas first, which is theorized to prepare the distal areas for drainage). The first phase is a \"preparatory\" phase, followed by the treatment or drainage phase, which utilizes light variable pressure to drain the fluid/ blood from the distal treatment areas. The second phase may be controlled by multiple programmable options. Examples of this type of pump include, but may not be limited to, the Flexitouch or LymphaPress Optimal. The Flexitouch Device (Tactile Systems Technology, Minneapolis, MN) is a 2-phase lymph preparation and drainage therapy device. The device consists of an electronic controller unit and garments which are worn on the trunk and upper and lower affected extremities and connected to the controller unit by tubing harnesses. The garment consists of 32 inflatable chambers that sequentially inflate and deflate at 1 to 3 second intervals, according to 1 of the 13 pre-programmed treatment patterns selected. Chamber pressure and treatment times can be adjusted. The manufacturer states that device's sequential action evacuates lymph from the trunk and extremities and drains it into the venous system. The garments are made from stretch material and are fitted with Velcro enclosures, so custom fitting of garments is not required. There are no published studies comparing the effectiveness of this 2-phase lymph preparation and drainage therapy device to standard segmented pneumatic compression devices. The ACTitouch Adaptive Compression therapy system is another more recently developed pump device. It combines intermittent pneumatic compression with a sustained gradient pressure. It may be used when stationary or when ambulating (walking).",

As most of my swelling is in my upper arm, and manageable with compression and manual lymph drainage, he did not recommend surgery. He noted that for the bypass surgery it works best from the elbow on down to the hand as the lymph and capillary drainage are more top surface there, so easier to get to surgically. He also does node transplants, but again only recommended for more extreme lymphedema. As the nodes are transplanted from the groin area typically, you can then end up with lymphedema in the leg. He did note that advancements are being made regularly, so to keep in touch with my medical staff. For now, I am managing well using the compression, along with a LymphPress occasionally. Hope this helps.",
