I was dealing with the same thing with my own mom. She was diagnosed in April. She had a mastectomy in May, but refused chemo. By November, she was in the hospital being informed that it had now moved to her brain, liver, bones and abdomen. She then decided that she would try chemo. Of course, you can guess at the outcome. It was way too late. We lost her on December 10. I understand her reluctance to have chemo. She too based her decision on the experience of my grandmother who passed away 20 years prior. I urge you to appeal to your mother with the knowledge that the treatments of today are nothing like years ago. I truly believe that if my mom knew that, she would have agreed to chemo when she was first diagnosed. How do we get the message out to women that todays medicine is not like it was 20 years ago???",
