This site has given me sisters here who have had the same experience! I was diagnosed with BC Nov 20th, 2017. I am a triple negative so I have to undergo the \"full meal deal,\" with no follow-up medication for prevention. I started with Chemo first because my tumor was 4.7cm and it was invasive and fast growing so it was believed that I would have a better surgical outcome if the tumor shrunk. I did Chemo from December to end of March with AC and Taxol. My BS decided that a lumpectomy was sufficient so she preceded with a r-sided lumpectomy. Because I was a DD size cup they could take generous amounts to get the margins. The breast was reconstructed & reduced so I could avoid larger dose radiation, and the left breast was reduced for symmetry. I am very happy with the results. I started Radiation on June 2, 2017 and am scheduled for a total of 20 treatments. I am presently having some wound healing issues to the rad side. I am told the wound will heal after rad but my biggest complaint is the discomfort of the bra on the incisions. This sounds so trivial compared to other posts so forgive me for my complaints, but I don't know who to ask. The plastic surgeon did a very nice job but he is not good at explaining aftercare and seemed to be in too big a hurry to answer my questions. He told me to read my discharge instructions. The printed material I was given after surgery from the hospital did not include much detail on care after 6 weeks. I have pretty much been discharged from his service so I feel like I am on my own. I am now 7 weeks out from surgery and this bra that I am wearing hits the incisions which are still tender and my plastic surgeon says to just find one that is \"more comfortable\". I have been using the internet for aftercare info and even that does not address my concerns: How long do I have weight lifting restrictions? How long do I wear the bra day and night? When can I resume sleeping on my side? What kind of bra am I suppose to be wearing? What has your PS ordered for a bra? ",
