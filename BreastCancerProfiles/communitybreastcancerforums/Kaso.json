Can you explain why the implant and nipple reconstruction followed, (assuming site of lumpectomy) and if this was can be done at the time of lumpectomy. What confuses me most in your personal surgery history is mastectomy. What made this your final surgery and not first? I am 63.

I guess that, confusion, is par for the initial journey through a breast cancer diagnosis. As you now know my initial pathology report following my biopsy was misread at a local hospital. That is where my initial benign diagnosis (\"it's not cancer\") and ADH was termed and I was told myoepothelial cells were present. It was at the breast cancer surgeon meeting that the BS had Yale rerun the pathology and the diagnosis turned to invasive mammary carcinoma & complete absence of myoepithelial cells. My lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy was 5 days ago. I was told by the surgeon that she removed a wide area of margin and 3 tiny nodes. I was also told that there was not enough tissue for an oncotype. I really had hoped for the assurance of an oncotype to help guide decisions that are forthcoming. I will ask if perhaps tissue from the original biopsy can be used for this when I meet with the BS next week I went for genetic counseling the day after my BS appointment. It was at the BS appointment that receptors were in fact ordered (due to the mis diagnosis they were never completed). I was tested following the genetic counseling meeting for BRCA 1 & 2, and a variety of other genome tests were ordered after the BRCA1 &2 were reported to be negative the day before surgery. My receptors to date came back as 100% Estrogen +, low progesterone +, and so far HER NEU was -. The fish score has not returned as yet. Now it is time to heal a bit and brace myself for further surgery if either margins or nodes are positive for cancer. I have a meeting with the BS in a week to get results. I have a meeting with the radiologist in 2 weeks, and in 3 weeks with an oncologist. I am hoping these doctors will work as a team to take the best care of me. Sherry",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2017 05:31PM - edited Sep 12, 2017 06:21PM by Kaso My call back mammorgram, a first for me, showed an \"8mm spiculated mass\" at the 12:00 position on my right breast. I told the radiologist to \"shoot to the chase\". He replied cancer or a radial scar. Biopsy was set for the following morning. When I left I called the Smilow Cancer Center and set an appointment with a breast surgeon. I knew this would be the little control I had in an awful unreal situation. When I showed for biopsy and told the radiologist to send pathology results to Smilow he was shocked I took action already. The biopsy was to yield results with benign or malignant in 3 working days and with receptor if malignant in 5-7 working days. I got a call from both Smilow and my internist in 3 days that the result was benign, but atypical ductal hyperplasia and that would need to be removed. SO I was \"lucky\" as both parties replied and I was pleased I had my appointment with a breast surgeon set. The receptors did not need to be run because I \"did not have cancer\". The receptors would have shown if the cancer was estrogen or progresterone driven or cause by a HER protien,or negative and or positive ER, PR, HER Sadly at the appointment to discuss ADH cells the surgeon enterred with an \"Oh my G-d the lab that the radiologist used made a mistake. You do have cancer. Infiltrating mammary carcinoma.\" My partial mastectomy (after hearing BRCA was negative) and sentinel node biopsy was 7/5. 5 nodes and margins came back clear 7-10 days later and the cancer was termed invasive ductal carcinoma. 1.5 cm Grade 1 and stage 1 My advice- no question should NOT be asked. I printed my questions and gave a son/s (I do not have a husband) who came to all the first appointments (surgery, first breast surgeon post surgery, first radiologist oncologist, first medical oncologist) the same list so they too knew what I needed answers too. One son also took notes and I was able to read my notes and his afterward.  My \"journey\" is still raw, but the diagnosis is slowing sinking in.I didn't \"feel\" cancer so I was in denial/shock. I have yet to start therapy because the receptors had to be done, genetic testing needed to be done, and then the MO appointment was set for last (7/31) and that was the one that authorized the oncotype dx- a must have (unless you can get the mammaprint) test to truly determine despite receptors if chemo is in fact needed. (If HER + or BRCA + chemo is necesary and you don't need the oncotype dx) If estrogen driven (I am 100% +3) then an inhibitor is prescribed after treatment. Unfortunately I have taken many detours. The CT SCan for simulation for radiotherapy found a spot on my lungs.I needed a lung CT scan and then I needed to see a thoracic oncologist..

I was told that a lumpectomy would be needed before the appointment and that this will be discussed in further detail at the appointment. My research informed me that these atypical cells could be masking cancer cells. Five minutes into the appointment the doctor was informed that my pathology report which was analyzed at a different hospital was incorrect and in fact I had infiltrating mammary carcinoma tubular features well differentiated. I was in shock. I heard what I was told but I did not understand it after all I tried for 10 days to wrap my mind around ADH My lumpectomy or partial mastectomy with sentinel lobe's biopsy was just two days ago. My surgeon told me that if I went in to surgery for the adh alone I would be returning to surgery in two weeks because the diagnosis after the original lumpectomy would be cancer I reflect over the past three weeks starting with a callback from mammogram, my first ultrasound, my first biopsy, the news of ADH and then the lumpectomy and I Marvel at myself that I got through this. But now I'm struggling to get through the next 10 days and embrace once again a possibly new diagnosis followed by more decisions and more choices. I await Pathology on the three tiny lobes that were taken, lobes I must say that hurt more than the site of the tumor and lobes that are not under the armpit as I thought they would be but rather on the far right side of my breast. I wait for pathology on the area of margin that was taken around the site of the actual mass that I was told at biopsy was 8 mm. If either pathology shows cancer cells my treatment will be that of chemo. The doctor has stated so many encouraging words saying she believes my cancer is not aggressive even though it's stated to be infiltrating. I have significant doubtfulness because of the change in pathology reading. Go with your gut and have that doctor remove anything and everything of suspicion. I know I asked before surgery are you sure you double and triple check my most recent 3-D mammogram of both breasts. I have to convince myself that just as I got through these three weeks I will get through the next three weeks and the three weeks after that and any and every course of treatment that is laid out for me  Sherry Ps it was the breast surgeon that recommended a partial and not full mastectomy.

Yes she presented it as a choice but honestly she made the choice for me. I know with my research on ADH she would have gone in and removed the atypical cells. She would not have gone to any lobes but she would have taken a margin around the atypical cells to confirm that they were in fact not a typical. She then would've sent everything to pathology, understanding that the biopsy is just on those samples removed. My atypical ductal hyperplasia it was 8 mm . The cells in the pathology report were less than 2 mm and that equated to five or six punches during biopsy. What would've happened to me if the atypical ductal hyperplasia of cells were removed is that pathology would show that cancer was in fact mixed in and I would be back in surgery to remove the margin around the original surgery and sentinel lobes I know my mind well.

The gynecologist said the treatments have caused me to become \"estrogen rich\" that he believes has resulted in the ADH diagnosis that I have in my breast and a 2007 diagnosis ofbenign endometrial hyperplasia. So now as I attempt to get sleep and pray to God that I'm given the strength to get through tomorrow surgery, I can't help to be afraid of what may be lurking in other parts of my body due to the \"estrogen richness\" from the years of fertility drugs. I want to hope that if my sentinel nodes are clear and if my oncotype is low then the possibility of radiation to the breast by hormone therapy will attack All the estrogen in my body ",

Why did you go on chemo with the pathology you posted? How could your receptors change from + to -? My followup from lumpectomy/snl is today and wonder what changes I am in store for.....",
