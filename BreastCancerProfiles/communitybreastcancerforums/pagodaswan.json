In 1999 I again had bloody discharge from a breast, this time my right one.  Went through the GP/surgeon thing and had ducts removed.  In 2002 I got the problem again in the right breast...with thickening of the areola, slight enlargement of the right breast and a tingly feeling...again, ducts removed plus 2 lymph nodes removed.  All 4 microdectomies (sp) done due to \"probable\" papilloma's...only once having had a mammogram. Roll forward to June 2010 and I had the ovaries removed following endometriosis gluing down the bowel & bladder. And now we are back at square one....about 2 months ago, right breast started tingling, the nipple burrowed its way inward and daily moderate bloody discharge.  The areola has thickened up again, the tingling feeling is as if the now completely retracted nipple is being pulled further inward, I had a rash like appearance around the nipple area...basically my nipple and areola have become one thickened area with a very weird shaping...ie...no longer the neat round shape, but a blotchy sort of shape. Last week I went to my GP and tomorrow I see the local breast clinic for tests (at this stage I have no clue what tests).  I am 48 years old, female and have 2 deceased aunts on my mothers side affected with breast cancer, unsure about any other family members due to them all passing away when I was a child.  Both parents passed when I was in my 20's. I know it's like asking how long a piece of string is, but does anyone have any advice as to what this might really be...and what I should ask tomorrow, please? Thanks  Log in to post a reply",

All I know is that have I leaked bloody mess all over half a dozen or so bra's in the last 8 weeks, I sleep 12 hours a night plus 3-4 hours during the day and still feel knackered, my right shoulder aches like I have been throwing a bowling ball overarm for hours non-stop, my right boob is not fitting the bra like the left one...and I have no nipple anymore, its merged with the areola completely and is like a thick, flat pancake that is insanely tingly and itchy...the symptoms are similar to that experienced before but alot stronger. Apparently the appointment can take upto 6 hours...they try to get all testing done and results delivered whilst I am captive there...oh joy.... The science boffins can do lots of things, but we still cannot get a new body on prescription (yet)",

During those times, I had one mammogram and no biopsies taken at all. From the letter I have, along with the questionaire, it has physical examination, then a choice (theirs, not mine) of ultrasound and/or mammogram and depending on results of that, either a core or fine needle biopsy.  Then discussion in the room with surgeon to decide the next step (if any). In the period tween the original problems and since, I have had no rechecking done...and tbh I didn't ask about it as I misguidedly thought that it wouldn't happen again.",

I am seeing the GP on Friday morning to try and chivvy things along but at this stage, I am not hopeful to be honest.

Over the last week or so I have \"borrowed\" a neighbours access to various sites such as Ancestry.com etc and tried to find family members...cousins mainly since I am the last in my close family bloodline. Had one hell of a shock this morning before going to the appointment so mentioned the information to the consultant, but to no real avail..  On my mother's side of the family, both her sisters died of \"lady cancer\" which I assumed to be either breast and/or ovarian cancer in the 1960's...both under 50 years old. On my dad's side of the family, his younger sister and mother died of cancer...not known as to which...in the 1970's and 1980's respectively.,,,both before the age of 60. The biggest shock was my older sister, she died in 1994 through suicide.  I did not know why or anything at the time and I never asked.  Through searches I managed to findher now remarried ex husband and he told me what happened.  She had found a lump in her breast at 44 years old, kept quiet about it cos she was scared, then got really sick and was taken to hospital where they found cancer all over her body...she couldn't cope, fell into a deep depression and overdosed on painkiller. I knew something about my aunt's on my mothers side but nothing about the deaths on my dad's side nor the true reason for my sister killing herself til today. I will be filling my GP in on all the new information next week and just hope that she will push for testing and for a quick resolution to the surgery request too.",

I had mammograms on both boobs, plus ultrasound on the misbehaving boob. The results were that both boobs are very dense so difficult to say without any certainty as to what the problem(s) are.  The consultant breast surgeon was called in during the ultrasound and confirmed that the ducts that are left from previous surgeries are showing \"signs of distress\" but she was unable to diagnose the type of \"distress\". Suggested I wait and see for 3-4 months to see if it settled down on its own...I said no way and burst into tears. Was ushered into another consulting room with a breast care nurse and we discussed options, I said that with the history - now 5 flare ups + family history - I couldn't face having to wait and see and just pretend the problems would go away. I told her that I wanted bilateral mastectomy...afterall, I have enough health issues on my plate, I do not need another one hanging round my neck on a \"wait and see\" basis. She agreed with me and said she had seen many women in my position who were adamant that enough was enough.  However, procedures are there to be followed, so the breast care nurse was going to discuss it with the consultant and then it would go the panel next week.  If the panel decide that I have good reason for bilateral mastectomy, I will be referred to an oncology-psychologist for councelling and if they accept that I mean what I say, then I will go onto the waiting list for surgery. I asked if there was a short cut, she said unlikely although I could try circumventing it by seeing my GP and having her refer me to the oncology-psychologist rather than waiting for a decision by the panel. Apparently the panel consists of breast care nurses, radiologists & breast surgeons.  She also told me that one surgeon was on maternity leave and the other on long term sick leave.... Upshot of it is that I might get turned down for bilateral mastectomy or if I get approval by the panel and the psychologist approve then it could be done early next year. In the meantime I have to watch for further deterioration or symptoms and go see the GP if that happens. I feel like I wasted 6 hours of my day tbh....",

He is referring me to the genticist and the oncology-psychologist with a view to carrying out a preventative bilateral mastectomy. He accepted that my family history and current/previous history of breast symptoms was grounds to go ahead, but there are set procedures to follow first, which is fine.  I told him that I would not change my mind and he accepted that fully but reiterated that he has to go through the set route. Once the referrals have been completed, he will arrange to see me again to discuss how to proceed and when. So although it will be a bit of a long winded process, at least now I can hope that my wishes will be carried out as I want them to be...something that after last week's appointment I really did not feel would happen since they were rushed and quite abrupt with me.  The surgeon is the lead consultant in the breast clinic and he seemed genuinely caring and concerned about my thoughts and feelings...so I am quietly hopeful.",
