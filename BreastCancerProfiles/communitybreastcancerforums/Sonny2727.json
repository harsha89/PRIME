She has had over 7 friends who went thru breast cancer just this year. So I have not told her. She has enough to just take care of my meds and my movement problems after a seizure. All my muscles get involved. Plus my meds make me helucinate. I see things she does not. They took my drivers License away. I take the city buses everywhere. The doctor I called tonight did my Histerectomy and will get something going Monday for me I hope. Thank you it feels good talking about it. I am home alone tonight and it is hard to focus. This is helping so much. I will let you all know everthing that happens. Be Well Sonny.",
