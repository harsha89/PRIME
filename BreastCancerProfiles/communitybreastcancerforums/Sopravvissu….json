I had 21 nodes taken out with Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (mine was a recurrence in nodes that were previously found as benign in my SNB), and am now finding out that I have a mass of clips that were left in during surgery. I found out after an MRI because I'm experiencing pain and discomfort with my median nerve, tingling, numbing, burning down my arm into my ring and pinky fingers. Apparently after an EMG nerve conduction test, I have a blockage of the Brachial Plexus which is the bundle of nerves under my arm. I see the Dr. of Physical Medicine today to review, however had an appt with my radiologist who showed me the images of the clips, that she thought by feel was another mass. She had done an earlier CT scan to rule out malignancy. So my question to you is what did your drs recommend since this post , have you had any success with procedures since , and how are you doing? I'm so relieved to have seen your post and hope you are doing well!",
