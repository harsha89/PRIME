I finished my DD AC X4 which was just about bearable, and i made it through. I start weekly Taxol x12  tomorrow, and even though everyone tells me it will be easier I am finding it extremely hard to believe. I am having my usual pre chemo anxiety/stress/jitters/anger/disgust. I hope to hear from anyone in this group who has started Taxol, or well, I will let you how it went!",

I have done with dose 2 of my dose dense AC.  The hair shedding andf taste changes have come in now. Even though I had buzzed down my hair last week.. I am shedding now and it just seems impossible. I am continually losing SO much hair... but there is more on my head.  How ARE you guys managing the constantly falling hair? How long does it take to reach fully bald?  And everything tastes the same.. thats is terrible.  but better than having nausea I guess.  Ann, what is it that doesnt feel right with your heart? I felt the same to .. but I was kind of paranoid before starting AC... I have noticed an increased heart rate on some days for no reason. Anyone else also?",

I have a 2.8 cm, Grade 3 , Stage 2a,  node negative tumour, which was removed by lumpectomy. I have met 3 oncologists, who all agree I need Chemo, given my age, tumour size and grade. Two of them recommend the AC-T regimen and one the TC regimen, though they all accept that either is good choice. So Iessentially have to decide between risk of heart damage or risk of cancer coming back. And should I do dose dense? ARRRGH I cant decide. Am I overtreating by choosing ACT or will I be risking cancre coming back with just TC? How much benefit does the A really give over the TC only regimen? How did you all decide? What did you all choose and why?
