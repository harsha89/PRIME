A friend of mine had knee surgery same day as my Mx and said I had to up my protein which helps the body to create new tissue.  So I started adding more protein and felt better after about a week.  Tomorrow I start chemo so I will have all sorts of NEW fatigue issues, .... blech. Thanks, Jen",

My 4th round was worse than death.  I was actually praying for death.  My body is just not doing well on the chemo - and I would hate to suffer through 2 more rounds only to get cancer again in a few years like what has happened to so many others!  Even with chemo, you are likely to get it again - so what is the point of all the suffering?   And it's not just the suffering, which is typically short term.  I fear for the long term implications of chemo on my health. I think chemo is like setting loose a gang of wild monkeys with machetes in your house to get rid of a mouse.  At the end, the mouse is probably still there and now you have a wrecked house. I want to hear from folks who decided not to do chemo, or who cut theirs short like I am thinking of, and whether there was reoccurence.  I also want to hear from those who went through chemo and had reoccurence anyway.",
