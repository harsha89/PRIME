    "Content": "bengirl wrote: I was diagnosed with dcis in situ and had a lumpectomy in jan 09. I had either 32 or 34 rounds of radiation, 4 directly to the tumor bed. I have gone for a mammo every yr and an mri every yr (6 month alternating). I get examined by a surgeon and an oncologist every three months. Now I feel a tightness on the top area of my breast. The skin is a \"pearly\" color, rectangular in shape. I went for a mammo and a sonogram and the sonogram showed a line of white where my tightness is. I had a biopsy in jan when my mri showed a change from previous mri in the tumor area and it was scar tissue. This pearly tight area is not near where I had the lumpectomy. The radiologist reading the sonogram suggested that I see a surgeon and have this area biopsied. I'm so discouraged and down. Will I have to go for biopsies every 6 months? Could this just be scar tissue? I thought that after going for radiation any cancer cells that were brewing would be destroyed. Has anyone had an area of pearly tightness two yrs after going thru radiation? Log in to post a reply",
