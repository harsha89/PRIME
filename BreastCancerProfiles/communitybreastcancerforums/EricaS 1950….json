Now December 2016 my hair is extremely thin and I'm wearing a wig. I've been on Femara since October of 2013. Did not lose hair on Femara alone. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987. I had a lumpectomy and all my lymph nodes removed which were all positive. In 1987 I was on chemo for 9 months and 37 treatments of radiation. In 1989 diagnosed with breast cancer on the other breast. Lumpectomy and 35 treatments of radiation. No hair loss then. In 2013 diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to my sternum. Started Femara. Late 2015 cancer spread around the heart. Now on both Femara and Ibrance. I hope this helped.",
