After my lumpectomy, rads and BSO for my stage 1 (grade 3) er pr pos, her2 neg early bc, my last visit was with the oncologist. He told me it had a 15-20 % chance of coming back, and that risk would remain constant. Completely took the wind out of my sails for a good two weeks after. He did say that if I took the AI for 5 years, that that would bring the risk of recurrance down to 7 to 10%. We all fixate on that percentage of recurrance, and not the larger percentage of it not recurring. I still have my moments of worry, and I am 2 1/2 years past my initial dx. My mom had stage 2 bc with 4 nodes involved. Dx when she was 58. Lived till she was 90 with no recurrance anywhere.",
