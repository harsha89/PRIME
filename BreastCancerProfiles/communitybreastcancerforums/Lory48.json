I was having the hardest time doing my manual massage becasue of where the swelling is. I would have DH do it when he was here, or use a bath towel across my back to try and get the same effect. Finally my LE therapist reccommended a pump.. I had a free home consult (1 hr using the pump unit) All I can say is wow!! Insurance approved it, the company waived my copay (700 bucks) and it's on its way here! I would highly reccommend ya'll look into something like this to help. After trying various garments, the heat, I was fed up with the pain and swelling. I will say, I found a compression bra (long line) that is made from the same type of fabric as my sleeves on amazon. I am waiting for it to arrive. I want comfort that does not make me look like I have a flak jacket on.",

I had been complaining for a few months that my side hurt (r). My primary and the surgeon that was going to do my colonoscopy suggested gallbladder. HA - 6 month follow-up after a mammo (which showed nothing in that left breast) I asked my radiation onco about the pain and told her I was worried- BAM she got me in for a CT (last CT of my liver was 6 months ago). Low and behold spots. So my mammo did not show, my last CT showed nothing, even my liver numbers were perfect. the pain is what got me diagnosed. I am a firm believer of \"listen to your body\" scans and tests don't always show what's going on.",

After speaking with the onco yesterday about that side pain, he said that he believes it IS the gallbladder because of the tracking I have of food vs symptoms. I trust him 100%  I am finding spicy, or fatty foods bring on the ache. Gonna miss those enchiladas! LOL  Now is I can find the energy needed to get some treadmill time in.",

After the first PET scan, there was activity in the liver, pancreas near my bladder, and two nodes, 1 near my sternum and one in my non-cancer boob. I have had 3 rounds of chemo, and just had my second PET today. Thursday I will learn if it's working.  I spent 18 months NED!! Or so I was told. This is all so surreal right now, as it has been a quick 3 months. I was ok when the Onco told my husband and I what they found, but it became overwhelming when they brought in the chaplain and a social worker to speak to us. I do remember the apt I had before the PET scan, the onco said they would have me meet with the surgeon to discuss that portion. After that, nothing more was said about a surgery option. I have been waiting to hear how chemo is working before I broach this question. I also did not want to know the onco's take on prognosis. I don't want that to have any affect on my positive mind set. So that's it- reality!! Looking forward to sharing this journey with each and everyone of you, even though I wish it weren't to be.",
