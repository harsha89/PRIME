I had a double mastectomy with the first stage of reconstructive surgery (expanders in place). Reading the various comments and recommendations is very comforting! I am trying to decide which route to go, implant then radiation or FLAP surgery then radiation. I've been doing research and heard women have more complications with the implant (CC, pain, loss of mobility, etc) vs. women who go the FLAP route. Do you mind sharing why you choose the implant route vs. the FLAP? Also, has anyone undergone a FLAP surgery? If so, can you share your experience? Thank you for taking the time to share experiences. This is a complicated process to navigate and requires a village of survivors to help guide the process. Thank you!",
