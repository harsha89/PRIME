During the treatment I felt weakness in my arm on the radiated side. It stopped but Now I also feel weakness. Does this mean it will become Bracial Neuropathy. Did people who got it also have the same initial symptoms. Finally, I also bumped a wall recently and when I was getting radiated I also got a bruise so I am wondering if the weakness is related to that.",

I just finished radiation post-mastectomy 3 days ago. I felt I rushed myself into the decision and didn't feel comfortable the entire time. What made it worse is I fell into a \"gray\" area-- some ONCs said yes and others said now. I have tissue expanders that will be impacted and lympadema risk not to mention my treatment was on the left side with 50 gray. Huge doses. I did it for two reasons-- to fight the cancer I have (as someone else said) and to be aggressive now while my kids are young. I went against all my principles and sacrificed my quality of life and also didn't listen to my surgeon who said not to get it (she is a woman). She said she would never get it. But I trusted the big wig ROs I consulted. Reduction in LRR was at most 10%. If I could re-do it, I would not do it or with someone else.  I am starting to think this is just the gift of cancer we have. We have anxiety overall but have displaced it. We also are not sure of ourselves and so second guess our decisions. We are forced to make decisions while our bodies and minds are undergoing trauma. Not fair. It was not ever clear to me the right choice but I Just kept scheduling myself for the radiation and then went along with it even though my body told me NOT to enter the hospital on the first day I was to start. This has all thrown me into a depression. I can't sleep. I am in pain from the radiation -- taste sensations have changed and dry mouth. I hope they go away. I am too young for this. My life was just fine 3 months ago but I am told it will be fine 3 months from now too.",

I don't really want to take artificial things so trying to avoid the protein shakes but am trying to get protein otherwise through eggs and beans and protein shakes and tofu. Its not so bad that I need a mouthwash. its been almost 4 weeks alreay since I am done with radiation. I used to always have a sore throat prior to radiation and just worried this made it worse. I am worried that my lower and upper esophagus spincter have been damaged. As soon as I eat anything, I burb and pass gas. Then often stomach is bloated or burns. Then I have to take teh antacid. I am also taking Fomadine.",

Post mastectomy radiation is worse than radiation after a lumpectomy usually. I got all my nodes radiated post mastectomy on my left side. My throat felt like I smoked 20 packs of cigarettes. They don\u2019t tell you this but it can get worse for 2 or more weeks after the last treatment. I hadn\u2019t heartburn, stomach burn and lost 20 llb because if it.

I am pretty sad.
