The side effects from this last round are horrible. My mouth is so full of sores and thrush that I can only eat bland soft food.  The oncologist agreed that stopping and just healing was the best option.  So I plan to heal my body and mouth and just enjoy the time I have left.  They estimate 2 to 4 months and I choose quality of life over quantity.  I respect your decision and hope you have a great summer with your family.  Hope we can both be our best for however long we have left. ",
