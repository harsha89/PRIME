Bessie, I also get the muscle aches, It seems to help when I massage that area and it does subside. It just takes a while for the itching to stop. Doctor said it was also normal and recommended using benadryl, but it makes me so sleepy....I'm such a medicine wussy! It does help knowing I'm not the only one going through these crazy things. Thanks ladies!",

It's like a constant awareness that there is something heavy on my chest. I'm trying not to regret having the reconstruction, but it is hard sometimes wondering if I made the right choice for myself. I keep telling myself you know it is worth it!",
