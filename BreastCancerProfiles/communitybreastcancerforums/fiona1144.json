I had 2 individual tumors measuring 4.5 cm and 3.5 cm.  4 months ago I had a mammogram which should a slight density, they wanted me to be checked in 4 months, which I was and bam! Here I am.  The doctors have been wonderful explaining things, its just so much to take in so fast.  The pathologic state is: pT2pN3apMX estrogen receptors:Negative Progesterone receptors: Negative HER 2 Neu: Positive Obviously this is not the diagnoses I wanted, but it is what I have and I am ready to beat this.  Can someone tell me how bad the diagnoses is.  Believe me I am staying on the positive side.  I want to be around for along time.  I have not had a great year, my 16 year old son was killed in a car accident on Dec 16th, 2008. It was the day before his sisters 21st birthday.  Believe me that is worse than the cancer.  I try to keep positive about my son.So I know I can work through this to with love and support.  If anyone is interested you can google my sons name: \"William Nazelrod\" there is a myspace page dedicated to him.  He was a great kid. Thank you all for taking the time to read my post and respond. 4ever in my heart *Galen* Dx 5/13/2009, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 40/40 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
