That being my sister was dx with DCIS in her early 50's and has been cancer free for 11 years. I have been having mammograms since I was 30 due to lumps and bumps and a fibroadenoma. Mammograms have always been normal and very clear according to my breast dr. Approx two years ago, I started having very focal, localized pain in my left breast on my left side around the 2 oclock position. Went to breast dr several times and she said mammos and exams were all clear, no need to be concerned. Finally, in July/August the pain and tenderness got so bad that I went for an appt and asked for an ultrasound. The pain is constant and very tender when I roll over at night and when I hold my kitty or nephew against my chest. Also started getting really sharp, stabbing pains around the entire left side of breast. She ordered an US and the tech found a vague area that she was concerned about enough to go have the radiologist come in, look and take over the US. At first, she couldn't find it but as soon as I pressed and found where my pain was, she saw the area of concern. The radiologist proceeded to tell me that she couldn't let me leave without scheduling a core needle biopsy. She said while it did not jump out at her as cancer, she was still concerned. I later found out that she rated it a 4 on the BIRADS scale. Biopsy was scheduled a week later and in the meantime, I spoke with the breast dr (surgeon) and asked if she would be doing the biopsy. I trust her and she is known to be the best breast surgeon in our city. She said she had looked at the films and the area was very vague shadowing and was only 2 cms and she preferred that the radiologist who found it, to perform the biopsy to make sure the appropriate area was sampled. The biopsy was completed with 4 samples and was US guided. The radiologist said the first two images showed the needle right in the center of the abnormality so he is positive he got the correct tissue and area. He said even if it was malignant, I would be fine because it was caught early. He called me himself two days later and said it was benign but to have my yrly mammo and another follow-up U/S in 7 months when my appt was scheduled. I was extremely relieved until a week later I recieved a letter from breast center stating the US pathology appeared normal but it was not 100% due to an addendum the pathologist had put on his report. I went and got a copy of the pathology report and US report. Pathology was benign but a lot of fatty tissue and blood vessels were found in samples and to be 100% accurate, if radiologist felt neccessary, the pathologist recommended a second biopsy. WHAT??! I was stunned. I was in tears, called my breast center and proceeded to talk to my breast dr two more times over next few days. She assured me she agreed with the radiologist that performed biopsy that a second biopsy was not needed. She said if she thought there was even a 1% chance of it being cancer, she would have me in surgery the next day. She flat out said, YOU DO NOT HAVE CANCER. I do trust her but I still have pain with no answers! So, to today...I still have terrible pain that continues on a daily and nightly basis. I cannot sleep because I am a stomach sleeper, going to the gym bothers it...I called two weeks ago and asked for a follow-up ultrasound to see if the area had changed. The US and biopsy was at the end of August so she called me back and said, let's just do an excisional biopsy. Let's take out the area that is causing pain. So, I have an excisional biopsy scheduled this coming Monday. She is not doing an US guided procedure. She said she is not removing because she thinks its cancer but she is hoping when the benign tissue is removed, the pain will stop. I am showing her the exact area before the anesthesia. It will be sent to pathology but she said she is not concerned one bit.... so, do I have a reason to be terrified of the results?? because I am.....the pain is exactly where the abnormality on the US was located and it was rated a 4 BIRADS. The breast surgeon said she doesn't agree with that rating by the radiologist. I am fatigued all the time, I have had terrible shoulder pain for over a year that physical therapy and meds do not help, I have the focal pain in the breast...sigh....any thoughts???
