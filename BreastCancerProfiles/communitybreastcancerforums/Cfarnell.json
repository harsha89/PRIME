Some burn is starting to happen on underarm near back. No pain. Greasing up with the Aquaphor. Saw rad doc today also. She said to keep exercising and stay hydrated to avoid fatigue. I\u2019ve been catching the yoga classes at ymca and it\u2019s helped with coping for sure. A shout out to Marie Curie for devoting her life to the study of radiation! Benefitting from her research with this therapy Hang in there everyone! Stay positive. ",
