I'm new to this and scared I'm also her 2+ which scares me even more,I'm really confused as to doing the lumpectomy vs mastectomy my docs say it's my decision but that their both equal when used w chemo..I am just scared that the cancer will come back if I don't have the mastectomy..anyone w similar story,would e greatly appreciated ,it's been 6 wks since I was diagnosed and I still can't shake the fear and anxiety and just get to a point where I feel positive that I will be ok..man I hope that comes soon!!!!
