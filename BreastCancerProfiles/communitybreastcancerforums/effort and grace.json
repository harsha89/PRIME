    "Content": "effort-and-grace wrote: I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma on May 17th. 2.3cm tumour, grade 1. For various reasons, I can not have the surgery until late August. I have seen a naturopath who specializes in oncology and I am taking proactive measures to improve my immune system, taking certain substances known to \"squelch metastases\" and am eating an impeccable diet and excercising almost dailt. Basically not giving this thing any room to thrive. How concerned should I be that my surgery will be 3 months after diagnosis? Log in to post a reply",
