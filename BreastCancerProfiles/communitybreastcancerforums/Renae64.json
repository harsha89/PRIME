I am almost 49, I thought I was young before the cancer struck April last year. I am not \"giving up\", however I wonder if any of you believe your cancer is part of God's plan for you. I am not a Chistian, however I do believe in God. When I focus on trusting Him, I think maybe this stage IV journey is all part of His plan for me. Anyone feel like this?

So much for trying to create a network of support, I did feel rather duped and dumped. :-( Since I met the women once, they will wonder where I am this week. Oh well, I am thankful for this online support group. We all benefit and no one is left out.

The breast care nurse who is managing it basically told me that they don't mix secondary women with those who are not, stage 1, 2, 3. in their meetings. They keep them apart since it can be too hard for those women who fears are what we have all been dealt. Hmm, pink is not for everyone. I don't know what to do, this place is for all women \"living with bc\". I met the founder and she seemed nice. I got mixed messages from this place.

I appreciate life and all the beauty I see, however it hurts. I feel so much. Stage IV is crap, I don't want to battle on. I would much rather just get it over with or somehow forget, it is the constant monkey on my back. I don't know if I am alone with these thoughts. The women who post are so strong, so amazing. Just when I want to forget I have cancer, I remember I can never forget. I feel weak but I know strength of mind is the only thing that will keep me here. Everyday, up and down. It is all so much, cancer sucks, I long for peace. How does one \"live\" with Stage IV without going nuts. I love all of you. We must be special to have survived this cruel disease day to day. Thanking you, beautiful women. Hugs, Renae Dx 4/3/2012, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 4/24/2012 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
