    "Content": "snicklefritz wrote: The Andrea Mitchell thing got me to thinking. We all know that early detection is important but that even the earliest cases of BC will recur. Some will, some won't and we don't know why. Call me a pessimist, but the very complex and diverse nature of this disease makes a cure nearly impossible. Some have ductal,some lobular, some er positive and others negative. Some are her2 positive and others negative. Other types like medullary and IBC etc. The drugs developed over the last 40 years have worked wonders and prolonged the lives of millions of us which is fabulous. But there is no cure. Prevention is the cure. We need to stop the cancer before it starts, period. Once the cancer starts, all bets are off and we here all know that, but most people in the general population, do not. I want to save my daughter and your daughters from this hell. I see Dr. Touhy's vaccine as our best hope so far. Maybe I am wrong but at least I would like to at least support the notion of the necessity of a vaccine. Any thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
