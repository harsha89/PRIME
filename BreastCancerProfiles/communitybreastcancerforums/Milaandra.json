It was supposed to be scheduled so I could get my results at my yearly surgeon follow-up, but that was last Thursday, so i guess that isn't happening. I don't have an appointment with my oncologist until the first of December. Hopefully I can try to convince one of the nurses to give me the results over the phone... I was diagnosed stage IV at the get-go (a year ago), and I've had no progression since. Between the first and the second, they thought there might have been some regression, but that depends on what spots I actually had...it seems there was some question about that. I definitely had three spots on my bones, one rib, one thorasic and a really chewed up lumbar which I had stabilized. The spine surgeon went through the last scan and said there were signs of \"fusion\". I wonder if that means healing? Anyway, like most of us, I freak out waiting for a scan and then waiting for the results, so I'm taking a chair in the waiting room and hoping the company will make the wait a bit easier. :)",

I, too, get some intermittent joint aches from tamoxifen.  The last few days it's been my right knee for some reason.  When I get up from my desk I'm practically limping. Don't you find the worst part of this condition, is the way every change in our bodies becomes sinister?  I started buffing my nails with one of those four sided things that takes off all the ridges...well, I guess I overdid it and one of my nails got a little weak, because when it grew to a certain length, the tip \"beaked\"...well, of course, in my over-active imagination that was a symptom of something horrendous...  ",
