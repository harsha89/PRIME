Thank you for your responses to my recent post and the reassurances that I'm not the only one who approached their first mammogram \"after BC\" with trepidation. Annie: Good luck on the your scans today! Turns out they were able to do both sides on me, even the one with the port, although the mammo tech and I had considerable discussion over how and if they were going to do it. My port is pretty low and I wanted it kept patent for my last herceptin the week after. I also was expecting an ultrasound that ultimately didn't happen. The tech came back after a short wait and said that the radiologist who looked at the 3D images said there was nothing of concern that needed US follow-up. So good news, right? I have to admit I was surprised, since US seemed to be of such importance when they were making the initial diagnosis last April. The next procedure I have to anticipate is removal of my port August 17th. I am more than ready to get rid of that. I still find it to be of considerable irritation up where it inserts into my jugular. I'm thankful I had it, though, since it saved my arm veins. Hvalley: Welcome. I finished taxol last October. My fingernails are very slow in making a completely \"normal\" comeback. They still split and tear off in small layers on both thumbs, but they're getting there. Hair growth on my head is back to normal. It is coming in curly like practically everyone else on this board! I used to pay money for the perm and haircut that made my hair look like it does now. BUT, my hairdresser said I shouldn't expect the curl to last. Oh well . . . I have noticed remarkably slower growth on my face, underams and legs, though. That I don't mind. I'm wondering if the herceptin has had anything to do with that and, now that I'm done with that (hooray!!), whether I'll have to go back to shaving my legs more often. DaraB, Cali, Kelly, Annie, Kechla: So nice to see pictures of you all with your curly/wavy hair and read of your adventures. I originally posted quite a bit on the July 2016 chemo board, but started \"lurking\" on the August board since my chemo started at the very end of July. All of you have been such a tight-knit group and so supportive of each other. You have all helped me out by your comments, observations and humor. I was sorry to read, Kechla, of your continuing struggle with anemia; sounds exhausting. Annie: your children are beautiful and little Josie is such a precious miracle. My prayers to you and your family for your continued health and recovery. Best wishes to everyone for the remainder of the summer. Hope everyone stays healthy and busy.",

Technically, I started chemo in July but went through all of August, September and the first 2 weeks of October. I'm extremely fortunate to have only had to endure the side effects of weekly taxol and herceptin as opposed to the torture that many of you have had at the hands of A, C and other chemotherapy treatments. At any rate, your \"October Vent\" expresses so many of the feelings that I have had so perfectly. I recently e-mailed my neighbor that I was welcoming the approximately 3-week break I have until radiation starts without showing up on Wednesdays for my weekly reminder that I have breast cancer. However, I mentioned that I guessed that I was going to be reminded of it daily thanks to the media blitz associated with Breast Cancer Awareness month. I heartily agree that if the media spurs more women to get breast cancer screenings, that is a good thing, and if the fund raising events held in October help further research that leads to better-tolerated treatments and more positive prognoses, all the better as well. But as a fellow person living with cancer, it is easy to get a little weary of the pink ribbons and Facebook posts from well-meaning people who haven't faced cancer in the mirror themselves. Cancer is isolating, and I do believe it's because people don't know what to say or do around the person they once knew as \"healthy\". That is why these discussion boards have been a boon to me during all of this because it allows me to connect with people who really understand. Thank you for your eloquence. I'm with all of you in spirit. Wendy",

Having my first mammo and U/S today 6 months post radiation. Is it normal to be as jumpy as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs? My last herceptin infusion is July 19, so I guess there is light at the end of the tunnel. I hope everyone here is doing respectably well. It's a long and winding road we all take towards recovery. Wishing all of you the best outcomes possible. Wendy",

So very difficult to tell scar tissue from other changes in the \"girls\". I get nervous every time I do a self breast exam. I will be sending lots of prayers for this to be a benign finding. Thank goodness for imaging technology to help straighten things out. At least you don't have to wait too long till your exams. Take good care and we will all hope for the best. Wendy",
