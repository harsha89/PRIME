      "Content": "KP1970 wrote: I had my 6-month check up yesterday and my blood work came back pretty normal, except for my protein levels. Total protein level is 8.3 g/dl (whatever that is), and the reference range of normal is 6.4-8.2 (so it's not terribly high, but still considered high). I asked my oncologist if this could mean cancer recurrence and he said it could, but he wasn't \"terribly concerned\" over it (easy for HIM to say)! Has anyone here had high protein levels before and it turned out to be nothing? He wants me to get another blood draw this week and of course, I am now freaking out a little...

I thought it was the bra I was wearing, got rid of it, but the soreness is still there. I have a mammo and breast ultrasound every year because of my BC history, and for the last 12 years they have come back clear. The last mammo and u/s was this past May. I have an order in by my dr to get a new one (and u/s), but I am panicking. Has anyone else here experienced this? There is no redness, lumps, discharge, swelling. It's just very hard and sore. ??

I was headed for a lumpectomy but my surgeon decided that I did not have enough breast tissue to have a \"good looking\" result (I am a 36B). Honestly (and I'm sorry if this is too 'graphic' for some), I am holding on to my good breast - hopefully forever. My breasts were always a very important part of intimacy for me. I am diligent about self breast exams (I check it every single morning in the shower) and with my mammos. I guess you could call me selfish - I am not willing to give up my other breast unless absolutely necessary! I wear a prothesis in my bra during the day and feel fine. The only time I feel \"lopsided\" is at night when I go braless. I had posted in the forums a few weeks ago about possible reconstruction, but have decided no for now. My husband doesn't care. He says he loves \"all\" of me -- and truthfully, I don't think he was ever really a breast man to begin with, lol (he prefers other \"parts) ;) ",
