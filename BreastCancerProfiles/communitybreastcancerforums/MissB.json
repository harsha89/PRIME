I had a few bumps in the road at the beginning and it just seems to make something that is all ready so hard on so many levels that much harder.  You rant all you want to!  I will tell you that I do like having a port-- ask them for some numbing cream to use before your first chemo appt.   I didn't know about that magical stuff until the nurse asked me when I was there if I had used it!  Makes a world of difference (and really, who needs to hurt more then they need to) Sending good thoughts your way",

We are strong and we can do this (althought there are days when this does suck, right?) I too love my wig!  I wear it to work, but have gotten brave enough to just wear a cute hat on the weekends.  My poor husband cried more than I did when he shaved my head, it was a very touching moment. I think no matter how prepared you are, the losing of the hair is pretty traumatizing and you finally can't hide the fact from the world that you are ill. For those of you who really don't like your wig, maybe you could find someone to donate it to?   My husband has been very supportive but he has his days. I think men just want to fix things and this is not fixable. There is not one darn thing they can do for the nausea, the fatigue, the hair loss, the bone pain, or even the outcome.  We have had a few arguments, mostly over silly things that he feels he can control.  I think as things go along we will all adjust, this is just new territory. So I hear of most of you going in to get your shots. Am I the only person here who has to give them herself? (well, my husband actually does it because I am not brave enough to inject myself).  The bone pain the first time was unbelievable but they scaled back the dosing a bit so that has not been a problem, at least the last round. Round three starts tonight (with only 6 doses instead of 7; we started with 8) Just had 3rd of the 4th DD A/CH treatment, then I start T (every week for 12)  I hear tha T is different and harder?? My biggest problem has been nausea, seems day 5 after treatment is the worst, but they have adjusted my meds again to see if that helps and if not, have recommended accupuncture. Numbing cream for the port is the simply the best. I didn't have it the first time and my port had only been in a week, so still pretty tender. It hurt like a son of a gun, so was terrified, even with the numbing cream that it would still hurt.  I felt nothing, it was a slice of heaven. I was told to put it on an hour before the appt. and to put some saran wrap over it so it doesn't rub off on your clothes. Worked like a dream. Hope everyone is having a terrific weekend! You can handle whatever you have in the week ahead",

It helped so much (and also made me a nervous wreck) I started my tx 9/22, first round 4 times every other week (A/CL)  and then I get to start Taxol every week for 12 weeks.  Have had two sessions so far; there are some things that seem to be going well (no mouth sores, yay!) and others not as well as I had hoped (nausea on days 4 and 5 is exhausting). Am also having to inject myself with Neupogen shots for a week after treatments and the bone pain I have had a few times is the most unbelievable pain I have ever had. And who thought that after all the surgery and poking and prodding that the thing I hate the most is giving myself a shot? My poor husband has had to help because I just can't find the courage to do it myself any longer (actually after the second one, I wimped out pretty quickly). While this is a club no one wants to be invited to, I am glad you are here.  It has normalized this whole process for me and made me feel less alone. I have the best support system anyone could ask for from family and friends but at the end of the day, no one but someone who is experiencing this can truly understand what it feels like, both physically and emotionally. I thought I was completely prepared for the hair loss, had hats and wigs all ready, but the first time clumps of hair started to come out in the shower I was devastated. I feel better now that a few days have passed and people have not responded strangely to the wig which made me feel better. I admire each and every one of you!  Just remember to breath!",
