I'm still sorting through treatment options too - waiting on Oncotype score for recommendations from my cancer center.   Meetings with RO and MO on 3/14 . . . .   every option is on the table . . .  recent bone scan was negative and CT scan showed no def sits of cancer - couple of odd things unrelated - very happy about those.   Love the thoughts Annette K - just what I needed to hear!  Thank you for reminding me to feel the sun! This is a new route in my journey for me - I had one foot out of the door of the cancer center with am \"unhealthy\" breast at Stage 0 DCIS 0/3 UMX on 10/10/11 behind me.  And boom!  My route became a whole lot less linear.   Hope you don't mind another one at the party . . . sure appreciate the sisterhood. . .

Add tamoxifen to that and the gym onc at Cleveland clinic said, \"You are adding fuel to a rocket that has already taken off. . . \". Next step there is to eliminate risk with proph hyst. . . .then they will push me into an AI.... I heard from 2 MOs today and my BS. . . . I have learned that's I hate being in the gray area. . .

And what I perceive to be the big question mark is the micromet in the sentinel lymph node. . . . . Throws every test off just a bit as it makes me (at least in my cancer center's eyes) - node positive . . . Aarrrggghhh. . .

Again, final pathology rules so I try to patiently wait on confirmation and then breathe a sigh of relief ..... Couple of surprises - boy have I been surprised at the pain!

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2011 11:37PM Kelleyod wrote: shannon - found this on another thread - it speaks to difference between necrosis and comedo necrosis but may help you . . .  ---------------------------------------------------------------- The term \"comedo necrosis\" means a large central area of necrosis that is confluent and expansive on microscopic review - i.e. this extends along and expands the ducts involved by DCIS. This type of necrosis is usually only seen with high grade DCIS (nuclear grade 3) , which is most frequently comedo type DCIS. Focal necrosis is a descriptor for very small areas of necrosis within a duct involved in DCIS. Focal necrosis is very common, and can be seen in all types of DCIS. When focal necrosis is present, the DCIS is at least nuclear grade 2 (and would not be generally classified as a nuclear grade 1). I view comedo DCIS (which always has \"comedo type necrosis\") as a specific type of DCIS with a higher incidence of being associated with an invasive tumor. I don't equate any specific clinical connotations with focal necrosis (other than when I see it, I know I am dealing with at least grade 2 DCIS). Again, focal necrosis is just a common finding. When we view these cases under the microscope we are looking for \"comedo type\" necrosis, because if we see it, we know we are dealing with a higher grade and need to search for a comedo type of DCIS.",

Big day at Moffitt Cancer Cewnter tomorrow - CT Scans (yes, Eema - buyin' 'em in bulk baby!). . .  Bone scan (I'll be doing shots. . . .hahahaha), and a new one - Ultrasound of axillary lymph node region.  Anyone have an idea of what they'd SEE with an ultrasound?  Certainly couldn't see cancer. . . .   Finally ordered Oncotype - duh - what took so long?  They also are getting me into a MO and RO for consult (I've never been to one at Moffitt, only locally) - again - why did I just WASTE A WEEK waiting to hear this?  I'm feeling like no one is moving fast enough . . .  is this typical?   I'm feeling the \"be your own advocate\" voice coming . . .

Next steps appear to be:  waiting on oncotype test results;  3/6 trip to Cleveland Clinic (for cancer treatment consultation vis a vis genetic mutation - PTEN vs. BRCA, my BRCA was negative)as well as long term living with this mutation; 3/14 MO and RO appt at the Cancer Center . . .   back in the waiting game.  My BS is very vested in the Onco score.  My local MO (who I met with today) is thinking if Onco is anything but low, I'm chemo bound - TC not AC he said.   4 rounds every three weeks - Can anyone lend me some insight into what I'd be in for?  I realize that I could be getting off pretty lucky with that. . . . Radiation, per local MO, is redundant if I take chemo - note - I don't know if I buy into that.  Just voicing his two cents.  What have y'all learned?  He seems to think that chemo kills it and helps remaining lymph nodes . . . so why radiate?  I still have that 3/14 RO appt - so I try to stay open minded.  Cookiemonster / Carn - so glad to hear your POV on ANDs.   I believe they wanted to do it to possibly remove nodes period to ensure they were negative.    They intimated that they'd take a large number to ensure negative which as we all know increases risks. . . . and as you said - for limited improvement / reward (if any at all) in outcome.   What I was worried about was - can they REALLY tell anything from Ultraound?  I guess so - at least I have to believe so now.  :)    I do know that now they'll monitor me in this area every six months by Ultrasound for two years.  Sooooo - I hate waiting.  And here I am - waiting.  I have taken the step to make an appt with a naturopathic Doctor for some consultation --- why not?  Get some supplement advice . . . lifestyle changes maybe.   I am totally wanting to get juicing going . . . .   How often do y'all do this?   Once / day - twice?  My dear sis in law was doing some serious juicing at 13 gallons / day - seriously.  Let's keep that convo happening too! Thanks for listening to me vent - really appreciate it.   Love to hear thoguhts on TC chemo, radiation and which beginner juicer is for me!  Happy Tuesday y'all. kelleyod",
