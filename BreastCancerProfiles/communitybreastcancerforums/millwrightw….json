Remember you are your best advocate.  Not only should you request your reports (they are yours)...but request that it be sent to your PC/GP....and they should not give you any problems about it....hopefully, it is just something that they overlooked...I would call and ask again, just a gentle nudge in their direction....if you had it done at a hospital....I know ours here also keeps records, and you can pick it up at the record keeping dept. there, it is the exact same report.  Also, with the history of fibroadenoma, you have an increased risk....so, being alert and concerned will only be a help for you. Hope that helps.....",
