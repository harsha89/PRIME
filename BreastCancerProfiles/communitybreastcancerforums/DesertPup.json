My lymph nodes were clear so no chemo necessary. Keep resting and walking and resting and walking. Fresh air, sun on your face and bed. And good TV, books. And cravings! Let yourself have a few cravings. There's this 8 layer chocolate cake at this gourmet grocer down the road? I buy a piece at a time and it's so HUGE and rich I eat it all week :) It helps.Hang in there and just try let the adventure unfold. Each day brings new strength and new obstacles too. It's a journey so take the time. So glad you have people around you making it easier.",

Everyone's' pain and energy thresholds are different and I was out and walking, on my laptop after the first week BUT- I still took it VERY easy, worked from bed, slept A LOT and did not overdo it. I'm two months past my mastectomy and in my last weeks of radiation and still have days that kick my ass HARD. Eating and drinking extremely well helps. I lived off avocado toast and pressed juice and it was great. And PLEASE accept help that week. It's so important to just stay in bed as much as you can :) Sending good thoughts!",

Made it all easy to get too and kept that T-Rex thing happening. You should totally be able to type. And you're welcome. For what it's worth, the surgery and recovery were not as bad as I thought it would be. BUT- That's just me so I don't want to build false hope. My surgeons gave me plenty of good stuff too like Botox and I think Celebrex to ease the pain right after. ",

Just a little tired some days but not totally floored. Skin is good and using my prescription cream daily. I did research on the radiation risks and nothing freaked me out that bad and I wanted to do the best I could eliminating all my cancer. Waiting for pathology sounds like a good idea. One step at a time ya know ?",
