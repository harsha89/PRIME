      "Content": "Early60s wrote: Hi. I had a lumpectomy and Intrabeam two weeks ago and had a resultant seroma aspirated last week, maybe about 60 cc or so. The seroma refilled within a day, although not as much volume as previously. Compression seems to help, and the seroma is much smaller. I can't even consider using heat to reduce its size as some suggest, because the seroma is directly under the 2-inch incision and I am a wimp! The incision and seroma are sore, but I'm trying to figure out what they'll be like around the holidays. Has anyone flown with a seroma? If so, was it badly behaved or benign? (My flight would be around 6.5 hours, plus a 1-2 hour layover.) I will also be starting either tamoxifen or an aromatese inhibitor right after Thanksgiving. That means I'll have been taking it for around four weeks by the time I would fly. I know some people get nauseous and some people get leg/bone cramps. And some people don't I just don't know whether flying is advisable or not with a seroma (which I anticipate may be smaller but not gone) and the new medicine. What do you guys think? Total wimp city on my part, or reasonable concerns? I can't tell!!!
