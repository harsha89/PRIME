The Dr. prescribed Silver Sulfadiazine which seemed to have nipped it in the bud very quickly.  I've been using 100% Aloe Vera gel religiously, applying a cold compress twice a day, and stopped wearing a bra unless I was in public.  Basically, I'm treating it like I would a sunburn. The first skin reaction I had was a mild pink color, then freckles started showing up, then large dark spots that looked like bruising, then some mild swelling, and now it's bright red.  Minimal pain. I've had some heartburn issues which I've treated with Tagamet.  Some fatigue but not dibilitating - I am an avid cyclist and have cut back on the number of miles I ride and am slowly building my endurance back up. Every once in a while I would have a scratchy throat after my treatment for about an hour or so.  Dr. has now told me to eliminate the bra completely and as a size D it has been quite an experience trying to find something to wear in public.  A tight cotton cami under a cotton button down blouse seems to work the best in our hot weather.   Am post-menopausal so will be starting estrogen blockers as soon as rads is done.  Luckily for me, I'm a teacher so if there can be a good time for this diagnosis, this was it.  Not sure how well I would have handled cancer and a classroom full of high school students. :)   Thanks for the comments and encouragement.  In spite of a good prognosis this is all a bit overwhelming at times.  It's nice to know you're not alone.",
