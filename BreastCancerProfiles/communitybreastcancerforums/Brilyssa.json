It still has the holes in it, they are not healing. However it is just there, not getting worde but no signs of going away. I was very concerned about IBC in the beginning but since it is not advancing in any way I do not hink think that is what it is. Has anyone ever seen anything like this? The only thing is it may be a little darker now, looks more \"bruised\" than before. This has me condused, and I can not get into the Dr. until August 20th. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks",

      "Content": "Brilyssa wrote: About a month ago I got a red spot just to the left of my nipple on my left breast. It is about the size of a quarter. It sometimes has peeling skin and it has a blueish color towards the bottom of the spot. It does not seem to hurt or anything but it does not go away either. A couple of days afo it started getting \"holes\" in it and blood with a little pus mixed with it. It also is \"seeping\" a pink tinged liquid out of the blueish area on it, but I do not see any \"holes\" in that area. 2 days ago a very small spot appeared about 1/2 inch above this one. I can not tell what it is yet? I am a little concerned about this as it is not going away. I keep myself clean and have been trying antibiotic cream on it but it is not helping. However I do not have any pain, swelling or \"heat\" in this area, so I do not want to over react. Has anyone ever had something like this? Log in to post a reply",
