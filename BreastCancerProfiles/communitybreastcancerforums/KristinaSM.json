I had Right Breast, Stage 1 IDC, only needed 5 years of hormonal therapy. Currently age 48. I have had no problems whatsoever. In the last 6 months I have had two right breast infections, cellulitis, where my entire breast turned red, swollen, painful, orange-peel texture, hot to touch. I developed a very low grade fever but suffered from horrible rigor chills, sever fatigue, nausea and vomiting. The first time, back in April, I was petrified I had IBC, but problems cleared with a dose of oral antibiotics and we all know cancer doesn\u2019t go away with antibiotics and it was chalked up to a bizarre but not unheard of infection. Second time, last month, the infection progressed quickly to septic cellulitis and I was treated with a week of IV Rocephin followed by a week of Augmentin after my breast doc immediately referred me to an Infectious Disease doc. It\u2019s happening AGAIN, a third time, and I\u2019m so frustrated, a bit worried and just not happy. Has anyone had this problem and if so, how were you treated and what were the recommendations for you? The ID doc says she has seen this before, unknown cause, and likely to be a recurring problem. I almost (almost) want to remove it. Seems very extreme but I\u2019m at my wits end Log in to post a reply",
