(she gave the analogy of the arm - but I think that's bogus because my arms have function - I'm really just looking for matching space at this point.)  The odds of getting cancer later in the 2nd breast are minimal - and no higher than anywhere else in the body (nice, odd comfort there).  She suggested waiting until after radiation to let the plastic surgeon make everything match.  Angie - I laughed when you said yours sag.  You are not going to believe what gravity and an additonal decade will do.  I really don't want one perky and one sag - but definitely don't want to pay for 2 sagging!   Mentally I had walked into the visit prepared for discussing mastectomy with immediate recon and chemo only.  So much for my plans - it seems like I sort of get my mind wrapped around it, then somehow I feel like I was punched in the gut with an iron fist again. ",
