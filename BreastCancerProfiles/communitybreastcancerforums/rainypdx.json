Right side removed, sentinel node biopsy, no reconstruction. I'm a newbie here and don't know all the terms used, so plz excuse. Also, a little loopy from the drugs... From the info I read pre-op, I was expecting a lot more pain and immobility but I think it's because most folks get reconstruction which seems to make things more difficult. I took my garbage to the curb an hour ago and have cooked myself 2 meals since I've been home--well, ok, it was only a can of soup! Range of motion is pretty darned good. If I weren't on the drugs, I'd feel confident to drive. Like everyone, I am anxious about the results from the biopsy. Seems as tho' I've been on pins and needles (heavy on the needles, lol!) for several months now. Just wanted to introduce myself as I know I'll be reading these boards. Best wishes to all of you...",
