To me, and again, Jmho, mega-dosing would be taking anything over what is required to have levels in the normal range. Very subjective but if you're getting at least 15-20 minutes of midday sun with most of your skin exposed (no sunscreen wearing shorts and a tank, for instance) and are otherwise healthy, I think swallowing extra would be mega-dosing. All kinds of variables though, like skin color, age, geographic location etc. are a consideration. I would definitely supplement in the winter, but like someone else mentioned above, no where near some of the doses I've read on these boards on occasion. Having said that, I have substantial bone mets and I'm trying really hard not to have my kidney fail. Too much, I would think, but not really sure (just my opinion), would have a detrimental effect on the kidneys because of the hypercalcimia that comes with those mets. I suppose maybe that's why the required amounts are all over the place....skin color, age, location, and most importantly, overall health. That last one being the biggest factor of what's good for some not being good for everyone. It really shouldn't be complicated, but because of all these variables in how it is absorbed and metabolized, D is the one that can't be a \"one size fits all\". Jo-5, I think summed it up best. \"normal is normal\", which is different for everyone. D is kind of unique.",

It's really all relative. As my onc explained, just because we don't see it on imaging doesn't mean there isn't something there. I think too often we take that good news from a scan of a moment in time and consider ourselves cancer-free when it isn't the case. So often he has seen scans done, radiologist reports no concerns and then a month later all hell breaks loose. Also,  interpretation of the scan results plays into it. One sees one thing,  another sees something else. I know this from experience as well. Had headaches, dizzy, nausea so I had a brain mri. Nothing seen. Five weeks later I found out I had brain mets.  Also, our bodies have been poisoned by treatments. The toll that takes on say, your kidneys and liver is horrendous. Just because a scan shows no cancer, doesn't mean the organ isn't destroyed.  I've often wondered how many die from actual tumors, as opposed to organs shutting down because they can't handle anymore abuse. I suspect it's a lot.....and that can happen in a blink of an eye.",

A level of 20 to 50 nanograms/ml. is the adequate range. I've been told it can be as low as 12 and still be normal if you're getting adequate sunlight, though I think that's probably a tad low for someone with cancer. My doctor also agrees with Jo-5. Mega dosing is a really bad idea. This is just my own opinion, but I would not supplement with a 26.3 25-hydroxy reading, but everyone's opinon probably differs, as do the opinions of doctors' probably. Eta: I'm basing this on someone who's blood calcium levels are in the normal range (i.e. no bone mets). That's where it would get a little trickier. Still trying to figure that one out.",

I wouldn't want to risk asking to get out without confirmation, though. If that fails, I'd run to my GP and ask him for advice into continuing the treatments at a higher dose. Sometimes they can find loopholes that force oncology to bend the rules a little. I hope you can find a way. ",

I just wanted to add my  experience a couple of years ago in which the radiologist made several attempts to inject dye into my \"good arm\", only because I told him to use that arm. He asked why after the failed attempts and I explained about having to baby the bad arm and he advised me that all the doctors and radiologists he works with or has been in contact with are re-thinking the whole thing. Apparantly there is no evidence to show that getting injections, iv's, cuts, etc. is actually the culprit of LE....more likely a cause they cannot identify at this point. After careful consideration, I tend to agree. I accidentally cut my arm that had 26 lymph nodes removed about five years ago and needed stitches. I fully expected to have problems, but they never came. I garden without gloves and have had numerous cuts, scratches, etc and decided that I would \"let things happen\" to my protected arm, because after numerous chemos, injections, etc. on my good arm, the veins are shot. The last 5 iv's and injections (for the last two years) have all been on my bad side and so far so good. I have noticed on occasion, that my arm is a little swollen. To counter-act the swelling, I find that a good rowing work-out reduces the swelling.",

That stuff just sits in your tummy and colon causing pain along the way. I read above that you have small kids, so this advice is going to have to be take it or leave it, depending on your views on the issue. Marijuana has been one of the best pain relievers for me. It might not help, but there comes a point when you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. There are ways to be inconspicuous about it with little people in the house. You can also discuss various other delivery methods or variations to obtain legally, but that Marinol stuff, for me, was completely useless. I do hope that with everyone putting their heads together, someone comes up with an option. Best wishes that your pain is soon reduced. There's really nothing worse than dealing with it 24/7.   ETA: if you do decide to go this route, please be sure you are using the proper strain. You want pain relief, you don't want to be just \"high\". If you live in a legal state, the place will blend it to your needs...if not, just ask on the boards. Someone on the alt or comp threads can always point you in the right direction. ",

For instance, if I went through chemo only to find out it didn't shrunk my tumor, spread or recurred shortly after, then I would agree with the graphic. If it worked to keep me cancer-free for years, then I would disagree. Even just reading people's stories on this site, you run the gammit of who has had success and who hasn't.  It's fairly easy for me to rationalize, but I see things in rather black/white, right/wrong. Recurrence or metastases shortly after chemo at a lesser stage, to me, translates to ineffective. Also, personally speaking from a Stage IV perspective, if it gives me an extra three, four months, leaving me disabled and damaged, it's grossly ineffective. Sadly, I can't think of a word that fits better than \"grossly\" without getting kicked off, but you get the idea.",

I know exactly what you mean about judging people we don't know, SpecialK, but I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that we do get a sense, a pretty good one I think, of what kind of people celebrities are by what they say and how they act.

I don't know what country your in, but in Canada, being Stage IV, depending on the extent of your disease, you should be entitled to Home Care if you are unable to take care of yourself. You're cancer clinic's social worker should be able to assist you. Meals on Wheels and such programs are provided at a reduced rate. Even if you're not in Canada, I imagine that a clinical social worker could point you in the right direction to get the care you need. I'd start there. I'm so sorry your family is making this harder for you.",

As someone mentioned, it can cause all-over body pain. If the Epsom salts helped, you know you need more magnesium. If you chew a couple TUMS, and it improves, you need more calcium. If you drink a couple glasses of orange juice with improvement, you need more potassium. My first step would be to do all three and see if you get some relief. Just a little trick I learned while going through plasma exchange, without having to run to the doctor all the time. A little boost of each, if you're low on any, make a difference you should notice right away.",

It took some doing to have it done. That could have changed since then. The test was to check for a particular antibody, called CV2. An over-abundance of this antibody is what lead to the diagnosis. Keeping my fingers crossed for you and your mom that the cause is much simpler.  After today, I'm going to be away from this board for a while. I do however, have pm notifications linked to my email so if you have any questions later, please Private Message and I'll know. I don't want to leave you stuck if you have questions.

I have been through six chemos and four years of herceptin and have never had a port or any trouble with my veins. The only difficulty I had was the dye for a CT scan, which went interstital and caused me a lot of grief and from what I've been told ports can't be used for that anyway. It was later determined that it was due to the tech's incompetence. I chose not to get a port because I really didn't want to look like, or be constantly reminded of the fact that I'm a cancer patient. It's probably best to get ALL your options from your medical team. Neither way is without it's risk of complications.....and it certainly has a lot to do with how competent your IV administrator is. Good luck to you, whatever you decide.",

I'm just jumping in to let you know that if doctors have exhausted all other causes, it could be something called paraneoplastic syndrome, which can really wreak havoc, neurologically. It's very rare, particularly with breast cancer, but I just thought I'd mention it because I have this syndrome and the tongue thing (which affected my speech) is one of my many symptoms. There is also another lady on here somewhere with this as well. If I remember correctly, her tongue was also involved. I'll see if I can find her post and give you the link.

If you're patient, the brown spots can be lightened with a combination of lemon juice, aloe vera, and sweet almond oil. It takes a long time, but does work if you hang in there. Rub lemon juice on the brown spot, follow with a light layer of aloe vera gel all over, then top off with sweet almond oil for some moisture. The lemon juice bleaches the brown spots, the aloe regenerates skin cells and the almond oil helps regenerate and provides moisture. Check the labels on the aloe vera....not all are as pure as they claim in the bold print. I like Lily Of The Desert brand \"gelly\". The sweet almond oil can be found at any health food store. Oh, and as a bonus it makes wrinkles less obvious too. P.S. Since you're light-skinned, concentrate the lemon juice on the brown spots only.",

I know it can be difficult to voice the issue because you don't want to be \" that patient\", but I think enough is enough. If you haven't made a big deal about it before, I would put a call in TODAY that you're at your wits end and you need to be seen by a palliative pain specialist. There are so many medications and combinations that you really do not have to suffer. I also don't know how you feel about meds, so just in case they're not your thing (they're not mine), I'm going to mention marijuana. My pain was in bone but mostly muscular and neurological. It helps. I know there's a stigma attached, but if it makes you feel better, it hardly matters at this point.  I'm so very sorry about your pain and I hope if you speak up, someone will listen and provide you some relief.

The cardiologist told me to be very careful exerting myself as the damage from those treatments is not the same kind of damage from obesity, lack of excercise etc., and there wasn't a whole lot I could do about it but try to keep it from getting worse. I did start feeling better after cutting salt out of my diet and being put on a beta blocker, but I think the damage has been done. I hope you can find a cardiologist that has a little more experience with cancer patients because feeling like your head is going to explode sounds serious.

The reason the soap under the bed thing works for some is that may commercial soap contains magnesium sulfate. It's easily absorbed through the skin and even a tiny bit can ease the cramps.  If the soap works for you,  it's probably a sign that your electrolytes are out of balance,  more often than not, magnesium is the culprit. Usually not overly serious, and soap will do the trick, but if it gets too low, it's very dangerous. I thought it was important to mention that it could be a sign of a much bigger problem that should probably be checked out.  That's why you often see people getting chemo, getting a little bag of magnesium on the side.  Many chemos leach the magnesium out of your body.  ",

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2015 08:34PM - edited Feb 9, 2015 08:35PM by leggo I'm so very sorry. I went through the same thing with my mom. She would freak out just looking at the hospital bed that palliative care sent over and there was no way she was going to stay in it. I think part of it was fear, but mostly confusion. Too many unfamiliar things all at once for a confused mind to process. I just ended up having her lay down in a twin bed with a child railing and that seemed more familiar and she wasn't always trying to crawl out on her own. The other side was against the wall. There was this kids toy that made a lazer line over a certain area that would beep if it was crossed, and I put that on the floor by the open side of the bed. Also, I noticed if there was no white noise in the background, she got more agitated. It helped to have the tv on 24/7. She also struggled with breathing and for some reason, having a fan blowing calmed her. It didn't improve her breathing but it seemed to make her think it did. I don't know if any of this will be helpful to you, but I thought I'd throw it out there. I know how difficult it is to care for someone when they're confused and probably terrified. It's exhausting and heart-breaking. It was especially difficult to tell her that I would be ok if she wanted to let go of her worries. Things calmed down a lot after that. I knew I wouldn't be, but she really needed to hear it. Much love and hugs to you during this very difficult time.",

Yesterday, I forgot to mention the most important thing that I learned while caring for my mom, other than the practical things. I had great difficulty getting her pain under control with the meds provided by palliative care. I really couldn't figure out why the oral meds were doing absolutely nothing except causing more pain. It wasn't until I spoke with her family doctor that everything fell in to place. If she's not eating, oral meds will just sit there in an empty stomach and burn like crazy until it's dispersed through the bloodstream, which just causes a vicious cycle of more pain. I'm the one who had to tell the palliative care nurse that I wanted her to have IV drugs only. She taught me how to run the IV pump at home and it made a huge difference. Once my mom's pain was controlled, she got more sleep. Thought I'd mention it because as great as hospice care is, sometimes they overlook the little things and just prescribe what they think would be the easiest for the care-taker to administer. Hugs.",

Something seems a little bit off about getting a Stage IV diagnosis without much of an explanation. I'd too, be questioning my treatment. I'd also be asking for a second biopsy if the pathology of the first is unclear. I did a little bit of reading and found some information regarding misdiagnosis. It seems it isn't as rare as we've been led to believe, but it seems to be more of an issue as to pathology type than the actual cancer diagnosis itself. I think that might be where the 44% statistic might come in. I've attached the link for the PDF. I don't think it would be unreasonable at all to have a second set of eyes read your charts to make sure your treatment is on track. I know myself, when I get bad news, I go deaf, blind and dumb for a bit so if you have to tell the doctor to explain over and over again, don't be embarassed....it's a lot to absorb.

Never knew what to think about it at the time, nor did I care as I only had sons. Since then, however, there have been several more studies about aflatoxin in peanuts actually causing liver cancer. Apparently, this toxin grows in the fungus in a peanut shell. I think most of the danger can be avoided by refrigeration. Fungus generally doesn't grow in the cold. Unfortunately, that toxin is in all varieties of peanut butter, even organic. It has more to do with moist soil than pesticides because of the naturally soft shell of peanuts...great for harbouring fungus.",

Deb, regarding the kerosene, I wonder if you may be thinking of hydrazine sulfate. Hydrazine is a bi-product of rocket fuel. Some years ago, Dr. Gold had been on a talk show discussing this treatment. He was treating Bob Guccione's wife, Kathy. She had claimed that this \"fuel\", whose compounds could certainly misconstrued as kerosene, had shrunk her bc tumors. I honestly have no opinion on whether this worked or not, but you should know, that she later died from complications from surgery. It's still being debated whether or not the hydrazine sulfate is what killed her. Please, please, please do not ingest kerosene. It's vastly different from the hydrazine sulfate.",

If you're anything like me, you research EVERYTHING that might help with this horrible disease. Hydrazine Sulfate is a legitimate drug (the rocket fuel bi-product). I remember researching it years ago when i first saw Kathy Keeton and Dr. Gold discussing it. I did discuss it with my doctor at that time and found out it could be somewhat effective in cancers that cause wasting. I kept it in my back brain pocket in case the time came that I may need it. In Canada, it is available by prescription. Anyway, I apologize for coming across as a \"don't drink the kerosene\" nut, which is probably something you already knew anyway. I just didn't want you burning out your esophagus. All this to say, that this particular \"fuel\" is an actual drug that has proven useful in some cases. I know I plan on using it if I have nothing else to lose.....but this is all something you can research on google and discuss with your doctor.",

When I was 25, I knew something was wrong in my breast, but getting a doctor to LISTEN, let alone have them do something about it was a nightmare. Too young, was all I ever heard. No big surprise to me, that when I started bleeding from my breast at 29 (while nursing) I received the bc diagnosis. Things moved quickly after that and I didn't keep quiet about how often I was blown off because of my age. I can only hope the surgeon I was referred to felt a little guilty. I would take comfort in the fact that you've had the diagnostic tests done and got the all clear, but stay vigilant. I couldn't even convince a doctor to check. It's all very frustrating.

However, when dealing with doctors you have to schmooze, keep it friendly. Bottom line, whatever doctor we see hold our life in their hands. You don't want to be labelled a problem patient. A tad manipulative, yes, but your life means way more to you than it does to him. They see people die everyday; they probably get jaded and angry too. A doctor is only human and has bad days like the rest of us. Stay on his good side. I've found that their body language and mannerisms mean way more than anything that comes out of their mouth. I would take that into account. edited to add: I just read your other post about the afinitor approval. Rather than speculating, I'd ask if he declined approval. He may have a good reason. It's a pretty harsh drug.",

They replace your drinking water tap with a smaller one for the system free of charge so your kitchen water is always on demand. If you happen to rent your water heater and softener from the same company, they often give you a deal on the osmosis systems. No water from the earth's toilet has touched my lips since 2006 unless it's been filtered. Worth every penny. The difference in the look and smell is amazing. ",

If she says she's living well with the disease, not only do I think it's possible, I've survived since 2009 without conventional treatment. I'm not cancer-free by any means, but I'm still alive thanks to off-label drugs and alternatives to keep my immune system in top working order. I think each situation or story has to be taken with a grain of salt, but I do know that if there's a will there's a way to live beyond doctors' expectations. I think it all comes down to those who feel they have nothing to lose, try anything, and those who think chemo and radiation are the gold standard. I know answering that question comes easier to some than others. Relying strictly on conventional treatments never even crossed my mind so I can easily relate to both women. Not 100% sure though, that I buy either story, but I'm not going to judge, because I'm open to anything and everything, but I try to use common sense in the process. If you say you've been \"cured\" of your advanced cancer by \"whatever\", I tune out. If you say you've outlived the norm by \"whatever\", I'm all ears and quite comfortable being my own guinea pig. ",

I assume your friend has already been through several chemos if she's on halaven, most of which have the potential to damage the heart. Coughing, shortness of breath? If that's ok, I'd be wondering about liver function.....high liver enzymes. Either way, I'd have it checked out until a reason is found. Legs don't usually swell up from treatment itself so I doubt it's a side effect (even though some doctors may right it off as such). There has to be an underlying cause and it could be serious.

It ached right between my spine and upper right shoulder blade. Sometimes it felt like a pulled muscle and sometimes I felt twingy stabs, like nerve pain, always in the back part of my shoulder. Before I found out about the liver mets, I thought it was bone related, like mets to my shoulder blade. It felt sort of the same. The pain didn't get worse or better when I moved my shoulder, which was the only reason I complained about it. Clued me in to not being muscle related. Forgot to mention, if you even suspect it might be liver related, please have it checked. I waited and regreted it. It had gotten pretty bad while I ignored it.",

This first one applies simply to my province (in Canada), but there were several treatments I was on that my onc felt would be better done weekly and the first thing he asked me was \"do you live in the city?\", which I do, but it really bothered me that if I didn't, I wouldn't benefit. This was just him trying to make my life easier mind you, but I couldn't help feel sorry for others who lived rural. Looking back, none of these treatments were so specialized that they couldn't be adminstered through a rural medical facility with a crash cart. ( I suspect I'll be hearing otherwise from someone ) The other thing is there's no denying years of treatment takes its toll physically and emotionally. I really didn't want to hear \"your hair will grow back, we can manage the side-effects, blah, blah. I know it's toxic...everyone does. Treatment shouldn't make you a shell. I am (was) one of the strongest people I know and I always took great pride in that. These treatments completely changed my personality ( as my family can attest to). Now I always feel vulnerable and out of control and I hate that feeling. I've still got that spirit, but the physical part is long gone and never came back. I miss the feeling that I could take on a n'er-do-well in the street. Now I know all I can do is run (or should I say quickly move away; running days are over), kwim? I constantly have to rationalize how far I'm willing to go (meaning stay alive) before I totally lose myself and undo all I taught my children leading by example. That's not what I'd hoped to teach them. I don't like them seeing me weak. There has to be a better way.....has to. ",

First one was done when I was initially diagnosed to see if it had spread to spinal fluid, in which case there would be no surgery for a secondary cancer (that onc was a serious a-hole). It was clear. Second one was done after mets diagnosis for the same reason as yours. I couldn't walk. There were some cells, but not enough to cause the neuro issues. So yes, both were helpful to determine treatment, I guess. Pain is all relative, but I didn't find the procedure painful. I just curled up in the fetal position and the doctor felt around for where to put the needle. It was pressure (which some may interpret as pain), but it didn't bother me. Only laying there perfectly still for hours afterwards was painful on my hips and back. Good luck with yours. I hope they figure out what's causing your neurological issues and can do something about it. ",

Arrogant, lousy doctors who pretend to know everything about metastatic breast cancer (I have a particular one in mind), and the most difficult (annoying is not the right word) having the knowledge your children will have to be without a mother and through it all they have to watch this nightmare. If one or all of these would just go away, I'd be a happy camper.",

It would be a game-changer if the CEO's of drug companies would be INCARCERATED instead of fined for fraud, corruption and pandering. It makes me physically sick that OUR money is continually used to pay fines instead of research. Someone please explain to me why pharmaceutical companies are immune to prison. Too big to jail? I want a cease and desist that they no longer can simply buy each other out and change the formulation of a drug just enough to call it something else and dupe people into thinking they've made some big advancement. Not one more dime made on the backs of the dying. I want those billions in fines paid, to be re-couped and personally handed over to our brightest scientists. Then we'll finally get somewhere. When that cure for disease is found, and I know it can be with proper funding, I want the researcher to immediately patent the drug as their own (think back to Jonas Salk, a most honourable man) and leave those money-grubbing skeeves to wallow in their own crapulence.

I think everyone is aware of the statistics and are not aware how that translates into the effect mbc has in one's life. I really don't think she's been put in charge of allocating funds, just trying to gain perspective on the difficulties associated with mbc. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who's doing anything to ameliorate the bull-shit is ok in my book.  I'm 100% sure the intention is not to deceive or allocate funds and definitely not some 30 year old dude living in mom's basement. I think we've had our share of those (and bored housewives)  but not this time. JMHO. ",
