      "Content": "rbeagan wrote: I had a mammogram and ultrasound done yesterday. The results were very questionable concerning my breast exams. It took them 2 hours of testing to come to any kind of conclusion. The Dr. kept saying, \"I really don't know.\" He said I had a bunch of cluster cysts and they would be very difficult to biopsy. He acted like they were fluid filled.  He said that some of my milk ducts were dilated in some spots and flat in other spots. He said that would indicate that something was in the ducts causing them to dilate, but he couldn't tell what it was. He even had the Tech do another ultrasound while he was standing there so that he could follow the milk ducts, and he said there were several 'blockages' in a couple of the ducts. He did not seem too concerned about the newest hard cyst that I have been feeling , but he seemed concerned about the cyst that was beside it that was there a year ago. He said that it had grown and is now 4.09cm. He said he could not tell if it was a complex cyst or if it was starting to thicken. It had a thick line going through the middle of it, and the outer edge looked thick as well. So he's not sure if I have 2 cysts growing in one. He was really confused about it all and asked me if I had other symptoms such as leakage or tenderness and I told him no. So he said that since I don't have any other symptoms, he wants me back in 6 months for a repeat ultrasound to see if there are any more changes. He said that some of the cysts had gotten smaller, but some had grown larger and I also had some extra ones that I didn't have last year. So what would you think if you got this kind of report? Would you get a second opinion? And of so, what kind of Dr. would you go to for that? This was the Radiologist that gave me the results. I asked him if I should go back to my Dr. about this and he said no, there was no need, just come back here in 6 months. From what I get out of the whole things, is that all of my cysts are fluid filled. He said that if any of the larger cysts start bothering me, they would drain them and send of the fluid to be biopsied. I would love to hear everyones opinion on my situation. I also do not have health insurance, so I'm thinking he is going about this conservatively because of that. But in my opinion, when it comes to the possibility of breast cancer, being conservative is out of the question. I'll mortgage my home if I have too!  Rhonda Log in to post a reply",

I guess I should have introduced myself a little, but you know how nerves have a tendency to get in the way of brain function sometimes!.. I am 46 and live in Indiana. Been married for 23 years and have 2 daughters ages 21 and 19. Our oldest daughter is married to her Marine and they have a beautiful 2 yr old little girl and are expecting baby #2. While our son-in-law was deployed in Afghanistan last summer, our daughter and her baby came to Indiana to live. In June a tornado ripped through her trailer in the middle of the night while she was in it and they lost everything. Thankfully, the baby was spending the night with us that night. 2 different hospitals told our daughter it was a miracle that she survived! You can read their story on a blog that I started for them: \"Together Again\"  We moved to Indiana 6 years ago to take care of my parents who have dementia. It has now come to the point where Home Health has told me that I need to call in Hospice for my dad who also has Parkinson's. So obviously, this is weighing heavily on me. Our youngest daughter is an EMT and a Volunteer Fire Fighter. I have always been a health nut and take vitamins, minerals, iodine and nutritional supplements along with natural progesterone. I have been a Women's Health Advocate for the past 7 years, educating women on the dangers of synthetic HRT and helping them balance their hormones naturally, and changing their diet by omitting sugars, refined carbs and caffeine and adding some exercise. So this whole thing has pretty much slapped me in the face. I told the Radiologist that I felt like going back to being a junk-a-holic!...  In Oct. 06 I was rushed to the ER with chest pains and found that I had 3 blockages and had to have 2 stents put in my heart and was diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease. This runs on my family and I lost a brother at the age of 46 to a massive heart attack. Both of my parents have had heart attacks as well. I also had cervical spine surgery in Feb 03. I began having problems with my breasts and was diagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease after I had a hysterectomy 13 years ago. I got started on natural  progesterone cream 7 years ago and the problems went away. We moved to Indiana 6 years ago and about a year later is when I felt a hard lump. Over time I thought it went away and did nothing about it. In Dec 09. I had another lump come up in the same spot, so went to the Dr. who sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. During the screening they found other lumps but said they were all fluid filled and told me to come back in a year. Last month is when I found this newest hard lump on my other breast and went in for another mammo and ultrasound and was more than confused when I left after being told to come back in 6 months for a repeat test. I plan to call my doctor this week and have her get the ball rolling on our next step. I am not comfortable with waiting 6 months. This has been going on long enough and it''s time to find out exactly what's going on. I appreciate so much all the info you all have posted. I am so glad I googled and found this site. You all have been a great help and you seem very loving and caring! God Bless all of you! ",
