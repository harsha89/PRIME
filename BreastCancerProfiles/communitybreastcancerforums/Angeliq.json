One minute I'm preoccupied with work and family and just the average day to day stuff like \"Hmmm, I wonder what I should make for dinner tonight?\" and the next I'm getting this scary diagnosis, surgery, chemo...My head is still spinning. Still here though and we are going to get through this! Had my first TC treatment on May 2. I was super hyper from the steroids the day before, day of, and day after. Then came the Neulasta shot. Started feeling achey with flu-like symptoms that kept getting progressively worse until day 6 when I had a fever up to 101.5 so off to the ER I went. Also developed \"chemo rash\" around my neck. They gave me stronger pain meds, an antibiotic, some benadryl, and later that day I was a lot better. May 23 was chemo #2. This time, I made sure I took the Neulasta cocktail the day before the shot. 1 Zyrtec, 1 benadryl, and a 500 mg tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol. Still had achey flu-like symptoms for the first week but they were not nearly as bad. I am also cold-capping. My hair was so thick and long that I had originally cut it short to about 5 inches but then was paranoid that I would have a big bald spot in the middle of my head because of the thickness so, contrary to PCC recommendations, I had it buzzed to about 1 inch all over. It's totally working and, although I have lost some hair, I dont have a single bald spot and my hair is still very thick all over on day 30. It's painful the first few minutes of each cap exchange but then gets better. It's also a tedious and expensive process, but I figure I am saving thousands in future hair transplants if I don't do this and end up with bald spots! I am also using Elastogel mitts and slippers and so far no nail changes or neuropathy.",

I have never experienced anything like that. I think it really helped to start the Zyrtec the day before the Neulasta shot this last time around. I was told my WBCs are supposed to be between 1,600 and 7,000. During \"Nadir\" mine were down to 800. Thanks to the Neulasta shot, however, by my second treatment, they were at 15,000 so it totally works. I hope your SEs won't be bad this time. Sending you and everyone here lots and lots of positive energy.",
