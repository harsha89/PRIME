      "Content": "NYJanet wrote: My mom, who always goes for her yearly mammos since I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2004, discovered a lump in her upper breast about 4 months ago.  She just had a follow up mammo/ultrasound.  The radiologist recommended a breast MRI (not sure if she can have that done as she had double hip replacement a few years back, if not, a CAT scan.  However the radiologist was unsure if it would be picked up on either test due to it's location (upper breast, close to the chest wall).  She called her doctor on Friday for the prescription to have it done and he said he wanted her to come in to discuss the results before doing anything and that he thinks she should have a fine needle biopsy.  We are both freaking out (she in Fla, me in NY).  When visiting her over Thanksgiving she had me feel the lump.  I never had a lump when I was diagnosed so I don't know what I should be feeling.  It felt \"marble-like\" and moved.  She has an appointment for Tuesday.  The waiting for her is extremely stressful.  Her good friend that she grew up with was just diagnosed with b/c and having a lumpectomy next Tuesday so of course she is thinking the worst.  I tried calling the doctor today to discuss it with him however he won't talk to me before he talks to her.  I would appreciate any thoughts from anyone who has been in this position.  As I said even though I'm a nearly 4 year survivor, mine being DCIS I have no idea about finding a lump and what it feels like and what to expect.  I'd appreciate any thoughts/comments.  Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I told the nurse in the doctor's office today to have my parents put my name on their HIPAA forms and have them sign it tomorrow when they see him.  I don't want to call my mom today and upset her even more.  One thing at a time.  Again thanks for your thoughts!",
