I was lead to believe that if they weren't benign, it would be DCIS which is easily treatable (surgical excision) & not life threatening. After reading through this site I am even more worried & scared than before. But, maybe I am not totally understanding?? Seems like maybe it's sometimes worse & not contained. Is it common for DCIS to result in mastectomy & radiation?? This is so scary & overwhelming! Log in to post a reply",

Now, the last couple of days I have been having quite a bit of pain in that breast. It seems odd to me that this would start now after this much time. There are no visible sign of infection. No redness, warmth, or discharge. Any ideas?? Has this happened to any of you?? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "newmomto1 wrote: I got a call a couple days ago that my biopsy was B9. I did request that the report be mailed to me (learned that here ) After reading it, I am a little nervous. It was a core biopsy that I had done due to microcalcs. Here's what is says: The biopsy contains fibrocystic changes inluding stromal fibrosis, cyst formation, columnar cell change without atypia, and moderate ductal hyperplasia. Intraductal calcifications are associated with hyperplasia. Comment: Certain proliferative lesions identified in breast biopsies are associated with an increased relative risk for the development of invasive carcinoma. According to the data at this time, there is a slightly increased risk (1.5-2.0 fold), when compared to the risk for women who have not had a breast biopsy, for patients whose biopsies contain: fibroadenoma with complex features, moderate or fibroid hyperplasia without atypia, sclorosing adenosis, papilloma. So, if I am reading this correctly, I am at an increased risk???? When I rec'd my call, they did not indicate this, even when I questioned them. What is your translation? Please advise, thanks!!!

I could do a repeat mammogram in 6 mos & again 6 mos after that. Or, they will send me to a surgeon & let him follow my case & advise me. WWYD????  Thanks! ",
