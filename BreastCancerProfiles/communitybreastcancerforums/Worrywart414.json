Maybe someone around here has been in a similar situation before or knows where I can find some helpful information. - I'm only 35, but I get regular breast ultrasounds (one exam per year), since I have very large and lumpy breasts and fibrocystic disease. Moreover, my mother died from inflammatory breast cancer at the age of 59 and my paternal aunt also passed away from a metastatic recurrence of IDC at the age of 70. - In May, my gynaecologist discovered something in my left breast that she wasn't sure about and sent me to a larger radiological screening clinic (specializing in breast imaging) to get it checked out. The radiologist described it as a \"complicated cyst\" that contained a thickened, gelatinous fluid. They managed to aspirate some of that fluid for cytological testing. The cytology came back negative/benign (full of proteins, mostly). I was given a BIRADS-3 assessment, with recommended follow-ups in six-month intervals for the next two years. - However, I also have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over ten years, the decade when I lost both my parents, both my aunts, and one uncle. So I have some health anxiety, especially linked to breast cancer. (My mum's IBC occurred only a few months after her screening mammogram and was dismissed by her doctors at first.) - The BIRADS-3 assessment made me so nervous and triggered my anxiety so hard that I asked for a second opinion at a large university hospital and certified breast center in late July, about 10 weeks after the initial diagnosis. They also found that complicated cyst, agreed with the original assessment, and asked me to get it checked out again at the screening clinic in November. - I've been to my follow-up at the radiological screening clinic today. This time, it was a different doctor (not the senior radiologist) who did the follow-up ultrasound. She couldn't find the cyst in the left breast anymore, though she found plenty of regular ones as usual. She thinks it has simply gone away on its own and just recommended going for my normal breast ultrasound in another 12 months. Now my question: Can a complicated cyst just have vanished on its own within the last four months? I know from experience that regular cysts seem to do this all the time, but does this also happen to cysts that contain thickened fluid and debris made of proteins? I'm sorry if this is a really stupid question, but I forgot to ask that at the doctor's and am rather afraid to go back (appointments give me panic attacks at the moment). I'm honestly sorry to bother you with my issues, as I really know they are nothing compared to what breast cancer patients have to go through. They are probably just due to anxiety and various ongoing health concerns. (There's also that weird case of nipple dermatitis that suddenly appeared in summer, but that's a different story.) I think this is actually good news and I should be happy, but I'm just so incredibly confused right now that I can't relax. So I'd be glad for more info. Thanks a lot in advance for all your help and your patience! Log in to post a reply",
