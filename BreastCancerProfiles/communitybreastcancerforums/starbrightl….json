I have children too, and your Halloween post really hit home and stuck with me. What we have to go through ourselves is one thing, but seeing how it efects those we love can be heartbreaking.. I think Mrs M always has a compassionate voice full of wisdom here. She made several really good points. Transitions are always hard and I think you will feel better once you have a plan in place. You need to take care of you. And your children need you in whatever capacity you can be there for them. Your husband has a job, and while it sucks that they are changing things on him, at least it will pay the bills for now......and hopefully  he can still seek out an option closer to home for the future. Dont give upin yourself. Despair is a trap that is easy to fall into but so hard to get put of once you fall over that edge. I know because I was teetering on that  very same edge a few days ago. And there was no one offering me a lifeline, I had to talk myself away from it. Praying helps, I know from your blog you beliece that as well. About three weeks ago the message at church really hit me. It was from 2 Samuel 7, God's promise to King David. King David wanted to build a temple, but God's plan was so much more....the royal line of David. So whatever plans we have, God has so much more in store for us. It might me that we have to give up a plan, or a deam, but in the end it might be more than we could have imagined. Breast cancer has changed us. Maybe some of the things that I so much wanted so much, that I thought were good things, maybe I wont be able to have. But I have faith that God's plan can be better than my own. It might be different than my plan, but it could also be so much greater. I know not everyone thinks this way, and I only posted this thought because I know you have a deep faith and maybe you too can get some hope from this. Think about all the things that you can control, focus on what you have that is good in your life. And try to make peace with the future by taking one day at a time. Becuase today is what we have right in front of us. ",

At first I felt more anxiety than anything so I took Ativan as needed. It lasts longer than Xanax and I feel more \"normal\" when I take it, Xanax tends to act quickly and I feel the effects more noticeably. So maybe Ativan might works better. I also think my pain meds helped me not feel depressed because I felt my emotions more at a distance, they weren't so painful and raw. Now that I have cut back on pain meds I have considered asking for an antidepressant but I don't think I really need one yet. I won't hesitate to ask for one if I feel like I need it, and I encourage you to talk to your Dr about it. The social worker at the hospital was surprised to hear I was not on one, I think it is very common for Stage IV women, especially those with family at home we are caring for, to feel overwhelmed and depressed. Please consider it, if it can help you live your life with more joy I would think that would really be helpful.  ",

It makes me upset to hear the way the visiting nurse is talking to you about what the cost is. When I am the patient I never want to make waves and I seem to think that the medical personnel know best. But when it is someone else it's easier for me to speak up. If you want to try something else, chemo or otherwise, then that is your decision and I would hope your Dr would respect you for it. Take support where you can find it, whether it is here or your local cancer center. There should be a social worker there who can help you, or who can point you to someone who can.",

So this school in Arizona is one where they were both accepted. I think it sounds like an adventure to them, heck it sounds like an adventure to me! Maybe I am letting cancer cloud my judgment more than I realize. But I have a close friend who children are going to college out of state, and I know how hard it is for her every time they call being sick or needing help. I am not saying much, I realize it is her life and I do want what is best for her. Breast cancer just adds another layer onto whatever it is that we are experiencing. I don't look at statistics so I don't talk with my children about them. I don't talk to them about the list I have in my head of future treatments. I don't want their lives consumed by a parent with cancer. It's not a secret in my house, but I don't think it is on their minds everyday like it is mine.

Sounds like you are going through a similar situation. Sending you peaceful thoughts, transitions are so hard. 3-16-2011-you are in Spokane! How I wish she would have considered some of the colleges around there, it would have made it so much easier on me. But it's not all about me, lol! I have to keep telling myself that :) And you are correct, every decision I make as a parent somehow has cancer factored in it, directly or indirectly. Rosevalley-I echo your thoughts. My health could change at any minute, it already did. I went from being healthy (or so I thought) so stage IV MBC within a few days. I don't feel well a lot of the time. And her younger siblings are going to miss her tremendously. Anywhere she ends up going will still be hard. Almasi-The school in Arizona is a bit less, but even so with airfare and travel time she will only be able to come home 2 or 3 times a year. And those times it will be battling holiday travel with the airline schedules. I think its one of those things you don't think will be a big deal as an 18 year old, but as an adult having done so, it sometimes makes it impossible to make a reservation or finding you are caught in flight delays. If there were a program she was interested in, or some reason she wanted to be far away I could understand a little better. But I am not getting much......just that it would be a fun place for she and her friend to go together. We are not in a financial position to fly her home, it will be school loans and campus jobs that will helping her pay expenses. DivineMrsM-In hindsight, I wish we would have talked about distance before. I did talk to her last week and asked her is she would go if her friend did not. She said no. She also said she wouldn't go to a college just because her friend did. So this college in Arizona just happens to be one they found appealing (sunshine mostly I am guessing). She said she didn't want to go that far away unless she had a friend go with her. I am kind of guessing that is one reason she is not as excited about the other school...she would be going alone. Kojnes-yes, it is a tough decision. The distance just seems so hard for me. I used to be able to jump in a car and drive across the state. I don't have the energy or stamina to do that anymore. So what was once possible, and the life I imagined when the children left home, is not a reality anymore. It is very sad. I am very depressed. And I am wrangling with a new insurance company who is restricting my meds so I am in pain and just an emotional mess. I had a busy weekend but now I am on hold with the insurance company and feel like crying. Benjnate-if she were definite about some concrete reason I could be so much more supportive. I think she wants to go to college, I think she is ready for that next step but I don't think she is ready to do it on her own, without a friend for back up. I think this is why we see her digging her heels in so much. Bon-I didn't get to read either post so no worries. I am sure there are many opinions out there. I am feeling so physically and emotionally vulnerable right now, I know that doesn't help any rational thought.",

Several months ago I went to a bead shownand bought some gorgeuous beads. But the y are still sitting there waiting for inspiration! But to my chagrin, the worst is my pile of photos I started organizing last spring for my daughters graduation. I needed some for decorations and I actually got excited about having in albums. Hee hee, there they still sit! But I found a desk and moved it into a spare room and I am feeeling a \"spark\" of interest in getting a little craft area together......a place that is all mine, even tho its still the kids toy room I am going to make my corner cute and infuse it with a sense of peace and hope it will promote some creativity. I miss that little \"spark\" of interest to keep me going and I feel like I neeed to nuture it. Are you ladies taking anything for depression? Im not, I may have a touch of depression but I dont think I am at the point of needing meds for it. I took zoloft once for ppd and I really lost all enjoyment in reading and hobbies so I would be reluctant fo try it again. Linda-I had my feelingsbhurt recently with family members too. We had a family reunion and they came for a couple of days (we were therenfor a week) and they made plans to go off and do their own thing. So instead of a nice big family dinner the last night, it was a rushed mess trying to work around their schedule (which only a couple of people even knew about) . So they acted put out, my mil and fil were totally confused as to why some people were eating early and some werent and sufffice to say I just coukdnt take the stress and back handed comments. I quietly went into the bedroom and cried becuase who knows how my health will be next year. I had hoped to really make a strong family connection all together this year and it didnt happen. I know everyone thinks \"oh well, maybe next year we will all enjoy being toghether\"........but for me it' s uncertain. Thank goodness my husband gets it, he totally understands even tho it is his family. And it hurts that after 3 days I spent less than 5 minutes all together with a couple of people. The saving grace is how much I enjoyed all my neices and nepews, and my children too. And truthfully most everyone else. I shouldnt let a couple of people ruin the experience for me, but when you are tired, and emotional and your health is up in the air, it can be hard to keep it together. I wish more people could recognize that. Of course we try to look good and put on a good front, that doesnt mean underneath we arent struggling and sometimes a kind word and a hug can really go a long way. A few minutes of genuine conversation helps too.much better than feeling like you are so far off someones radar they dont really acknowledge you. ARGH! Here I go again.......I need the grace to let this go, it is over and done with :)",

My MO didn't think Falsodex or Arimedex would be good option if I wanted to change meds because in his opinion if we think Femara has failed, those 2 are too similar Femara and the cancer has probably already figured out how to work around it. But going to A/A combo scares me because of the SE and because I feel like I am using up my options too quickly. I don't want to cancer to spread to any other organs, but I also don't want to give up Femara too soon. My MO feels like since the spot has been there for 7 months and is slightly increased with this last PET that radiation is an acceptable treatment. We meet with a RO next week so hopefully that will clear up the questions about radiation. As of right now I am leaning towards radiation, and holding off on switching from Femara to A/A. I have a daughter graduating from High school in June and we jhad planned a big party here for her and my nephew. My children are 20,18,15,12 and 7. I am not sure that the beginning of summer is the best time to change treatment, I think I would rather enjoy the summer unless something changes like a huge jump in tumor markers or more pain somewhere else. I wish it were more clear cut. Yesterday my gut told me to give up on the Femara, today it is telling me something different, lol! Bestbird-you mentioned Faslodex which my MO seemed to think was not a good option for the reason I stated above. Do you have any additional thoughts? Since my cancer was diagnosed when I had mets to the GI tract anything GI related scares me because I was so sick from the mets. This is part of my hesitation with the A/A combo. dbl-good advice to proceed with caution. I am feeling pretty good right now, the pain is manageable but the fact that I have pain is worrisome. And I have some pain in my ribs and lower abdomen, all areas where I had previous mets. So whether the pain is just healing/old or new cancer is impossible to tell. Nothing other than the one area on my spine lit up. BUT just to confuse the issue, last fall I had several areas in the spine that barely lit up (suv of 1) on that scan. That was 7 months ago. Now only the one area appears active, so my MO had no answer for that. I have been on Femara for almost 2 years. I think it just shows how much I is really unknown and how even PET scans can be difficult to interpret. Patty-Thanks telling me radiation worked for you. It's always good to hear someone else's experience. And I totally agree about not wanting to blow through all options too quickly. So I am just as confused as ever! I am learning so much and enjoying knowing I am not alone. Thank you to all of you.    ",

My gut feeling is turning more toward changing treatment, even if it means taking some time to figure out the best next step. I think I tend to downplay pain and those weird feelings we get, but I have had in increase in rib pain and some pain/discomfort in my lower abdominal area. Based on the scan and tumor markers I think it is slow growing, maybe not even apparent on the scan. I will find out more today. But I am the one who brought up radiation to my onc before the scan. He tends to be open minded to my suggestions, so often I feel like need to \"direct\" the conversation because really, no one really knows how we are going to respond to a treatment and there are so many \"theories\" out there it makes it hard when we are told we need to decide. I wish it were more of a \"do X and then move onto Y etc\". But my back is bothering me today, I think it is a sign I need to move onto the next step even if my onc isn't too concerned.  My DH asked for the apt today, my onc was happy to wait until my next apt in 3 weeks which makes me think he must not be too concerned.

But after talking and reviewing the PET scan the area effects T9 vertebrae and even though the suv is low (change of 2.6 to 3.8) the area is about 1/3 of the vertebrae. So there is a possible risk of compression fracture on the anterior (inside facing toward organs) side. But he still felt like the risk at this point was not critical so we could monitor it in 2 weeks with a CT (so PET/CT) would be 30 days apart. Or we could treat it with SRT to prevent future growth and hope to reduce pain. He really didn't seem to lean toward one approach or another. I just wonder how many \"smoldering\" cancer sites there could be in my body. At diagnosis I had extensive mets, now there is only this one appearing active. I have unexplained abdominal pain in addition to back pain so there is a chance the cancer is just lurking. So if that's the case I don't know if it would be worth it to radiate now and then find out soon that Femara failed and I have other active spots so I would have to change meds anyway. Do I want to put myself through the whole radiation experience knowing the next med could just wipe out the met in the spine? Truthfully, I dread the radiation.....MRI, body casting, possible side effects. I am so claustrophobic, I know it's dumb and I would get through it if I had to. I just don't know if it's the best thing.",

Tamoxiifen and gemzar, the tamox probably was the changing force due to what the tumor markers indicated. We really do have to advocate for ourselves. Drs say one thing, and often something else later. Who knows, it can be an error in what we originally understood, or perhaps the Dr was thinking of something or someone else.

I did call a breast cancer specialist I saw once in Seattle after I was diagnosed. She said to call her at the point we were thinking of changing treatment. Well I called and she is booked several months out! And they don't do email consultations. But her nurse coordinator did say if I sent her my latest PET scan and Dr's notes she could weigh in on whether or not it would be advisable to stay on the Femara. I was disappointed, I was hoping to get  2nd opinion or at least some info on another AI as a possibility. I mean I'm glad that I don't have to make a decision right away, but if I did I would be really upset that I would have to wait a few months to get in as an existing patient.

I do agree that a 2nd opinion from a breast specialist is a good idea. I have one in Seattle (5hours away) that I could see in late July. Her nurse is going to gather my PET, lab results and Dr's chart notes to run by her to see what she thinks. I am crossing my fingers that she will be thorough and really look into it, since I am not there to ask her questions in person it makes me a bit nervous. But she is a leader in breast cancer research (which is why it is hard to get into her office, she travels a lot) so I am hopeful. Heidihill- The RO I met with has a long history with radiation, he specialized in SRT which is a one shot treatment of radiation rather than the several doses over a long period of time. He moved here to our cancer center to start up the SRT program. He has no problem with me seeking another opinion. He spent over 1 1/2 hours just on a consultation with us. That is why he does the MRI and casting, to be sure he is getting the direct spot. The other kinds of radiation will radiate over more space in the body so placement isn't quite as critical (again, this is my interpretation of what he said, I may be misquoting). He could do both but feels the SRT is a better option for me. Thank you both for responding. It just makes me feel so much better to talk it out with people who understand.  My DH really just want me to do the radiation therapy. He is a chiropractor and sees people living with compression fractures all the time and he doesn't want that to happen me. While repsects whatever I decide I do feel like his experience weighs in on my decision. And claustrophobia shouldn't rationally be a deciding factor......ha ha because that is where my mind automatically goes! And the pain.....that alone tells me something needs to be done.  ",

You have been through a lot in the past year, and Im sure you had hoped to be done with treatment and now this isnt what you wanted to hear. The good news is that many women live many years through treatment so we do have hope. I know a woman who has had it for 19 years. So I look to her and other similar stories when I get really down.

Julie-What an amazing place! I love anything tropical, I lived in Hawaii for 2 years and try to go back as much as possible. Which isn't often but we did take all the kids this last spring break and spent two weeks on Maui. Heaven!!! I think the sea air and sun are the best therapy, oh and the beach and water too. I would love to go to the Carribean Islands but it would be a long trip from Washington state. Thanks for sharing your photos. Shutterbug-I would also love to see Michigan. We had a dog that came from Traverse City :) He was a Portugese Water Dog and he hated the water! I still keep in contact with the breeder but sadly he passed away last year. Hope-My husband fished in Alaska in the summers to help pay for college. We have always talked about going someday. He keeps trying to get a reunion of his fishing buddies to do fishing trip.....I think that is more of a \"guys\" weekend trip though! A cruise is more my idea! Charlotte-I am in envy of all the places you have available to see there. I would love to see a museum that is something other than the Oregon Trail, or Native American. They are great, don't get me wrong but that is all that we have available here. We live miles from the Whitman Mission and that is always a 5th grade field trip I love to go on with the kids.

It is about a woman with an autoimmnue disease and her hunt to find some relief in meditiation, yoga etc. She talks about adverse childhood experiences and how they can weaken the body, I am not quite sure I agree with this part but it is food for thought and only a small part of the book from what I can see.

I just haven't wanted to add a new med into the mix, but I wouldn't hesitate if the Ativan didn't work or I thought it could help. Our families do need us, and as Ebru mentioned the housework and cleaning really aren't important. It's just us, being present to them. Listening to them about their day. Smiling at a new discovery or joke they are trying to make you cheer up. Just being in the room, even if you are napping. As long as we are here, it is a gift to them. I have to remind myself of this, and some days it is the thing that gets me out of bed. I hope you are having a better week.",

Then I had about 2 years on Femara which really helped until recently when I had progression on an area on my spine. Has your Dr talked about changing to one of the Aromatase Inhibitors? I always thought chemo was the best or most effective thing, but with ER+ cancer I think attacking it from that angle might be most effective. As for the emotional part, I thought I was \"the worst nightmare\" scenario also. I went from being an active, healthy mom of 5 one week to a stage IV with extensive mets the next week. I lost 25 lbs and my GI tract wouldn't digest food due to GI mets. But I am so much better now, 2 1/2 years later that most people who don't know me have no idea I have cancer. So it is possible to find a treatment  that works even when one fails.  Hugs to you, this is such a difficult thing to deal with but please keep in mind there are many of us here going through the same thing.    ",

I always get anxious this time of year, even befire cancer. And having the tv on with Hgtv or something simmilar would really help me as well. Sometimes the quiet is unbearable when you are anxious. I would really talk to hospice about her anxiety.....I have given my husband good instruction to not let me get overtaken by anxiety.  Ativan is fine, but there are other options available such as Xanax and klonopin. You mentioned notb wanting to overuse them, but I would ask you to not under use them as well. Hospice should be able to help with the correct dosage and timing so your mom doesnt have to suffer with anxiety. That is what I would want for myself. ((((((Hugs)))))))))) to you and your family.",

I just made a new post about children heading off to college so if any of you have some advice or sympathy or whoops of cheer (lol not me) to add I would love to hear it! We are deep in the middle of the school crud. Everyone has been sick except dh, which is a blessing because otherwise I don't think we would have survived. My ds 15yo has been on three rounds of antibiotics and is finally well. Being a teenage boy, not much slowed him down. On the other hand, dd 12yo doesn't really like school and has missed 2 weeks due to a viral cough/cold (probably the same) and just went back to school yesterday. Last night she started vomiting and is now home sick again. My ds 7 yo is still home sick with the cough/cold. Thank goodness it is a small school, and we are up to date on homework. The school said many kids are sick, I am not really worried about the school part, I just feel like we are never going to get well. I finally made an apt with my dentist last week for a tooth that has been bothering me off and on for a long time. It was never really bad so as you all know, it's easy to put off something like that when we all have monthly onc visits, scans etc. Well I ended up needing a root canal, and while I was there they redid an old one that bothered me. This was all last week. I thought I was doing pretty good but it really knocked me on my butt for the next few days. My emotions are so up and down. I haven't been able to go to yoga since the kids have been sick, so my back has really been bothering me. Of course there is an area in my back that my onc is watching for whenever my back hurts my mind goes into worry mode. It is a subconscious thing, sometimes I don't even realize it until I notice how anxious I am. I did get to go for a massage which helped tremendously. And he thought it was a muscle thing not coming from my spine. We can hope. So I am spilling it all to you wonderful ladies, because while I do have friends in real life, I don't have anyone to talk to like this that would really get it. A few weeks ago, I pulled out all my pictures to organize since my dd 18yo is graduating this year. And then I got sick. So there is a huge mess in our downstairs family room that confronts me each time I walk into it. I am tempted to shove it all back into boxes. I literally cannot make myself sit down and do it. I hope you are all well surviving winter. It is sunny here today so I keep reminding myself we will get through this and hopefully have better days ahead.",

I automatically think that the cancer is at the center of whatever it is, but often when I ask questions and talk to them I find out it is completely something different....a problem in school, mad about something etc. And that is such a relief!",

I have a son in 2nd grade, a daughter in 7th grade, a Son who is a Sophomore, and 2 college age daughters who have not gone to school yet (that will be next week, sob). The day started out so great until I read on FB that my daughter in 7th grade's best friend was going to a different school. This is a small class of girls, she was my daughters one and only girl friend. We have gotten together over the summer and she was just at her friends house two days ago. The mom and I are friends. So my daughter is devastated and I am so hurt that they couldn't even send out a \"heads up text\" beforehand because it is pretty crappy to show up on the first day of school and find out your bf isn't there. I sent the mom and text and asked her to call me. They did this 2 years ago. I had just been diagnosed with bc and was so sick and my dd was struggling at school. One day she went to school and her bf (same girl) wasn't there. No warning or explanation given. Later I told the mom how hurt we were, she said she didn't want to bother us because she knew how sick I was. I thought we had a good talk and she understood why we were hurt. The next year the bf came back to school and things picked up with the girls where they left off and all was well. Until yesterday. I think I am as hurt as my dd, I thought the mom and I were friends and for her to not realize a decision like this would really effect my family floors me. I asked her to call me and that I had no idea they were considering this and she just sent a quick text back saying she would call later. She didn't call. And I had even seen the mom and her younger daughter at school and she didn't say anything about the 7th grader not coming back. It was just a big reality check. Obviously we are not on their radar enough for them to even think how this would effect us and at least let us know!. Our daughters were together many times this summer. Us moms have relied on each other for sleep overs on weekends when one of us was busy with older childrens activities. I am just so hurt and upset. I don't know how people can be so inconsiderate? To see it on fb and not even have a text or call to let us know? Truthfully this is just #4 of a series of events that is pushing all my emotional buttons right now. There are wildfires all over the state, our cabin and my brother's cabin are both being threatned. My father needs either 24 hour home care or a nursing home, I took him to the hospital and he is not doing well. My dd is leaving for college next week and our home is going to have an empty hole where her joyful spirit lifts us up. She has been a huge help with the younger kids and grocery shopping etc. It is going to be hard. And my tumor markers are continuing to rise on A/A combo and I have a full body rash. Hopefully it is too soon to tell if the A/A is working, it is just worrisome. So to find out I don't have the support of a friend that I thought I had, it just put me over the edge yesterday. Today I am moving on :) Have a great weekend ladies. And if you live Washington state my prayers are for safety for us all. And for anyone else who is so inclined, please pray for RAIN for our poor state :( And I apologize for being so self absorbed that I have not commented to anyone directly.",

Wow Bestbird, thank you for the condensed and easy to understand sequencing you outlined :) To be fair, I don't think my onc put Faslodex in the category of an AI. I think that was my misunderstanding due to the way he dismissed it when I brought it up. I will have to ask him why he dismissed it, my impression was that the A/A combo was the next best thing in line. Here is my progression....diagnosed Stage IV, 2 round of chemo plus Tamoxifen (so I think this would be considered first line), Tamox failed after 1 year so on to Femara (second line) which now may be failing after 2 years. Last PET indicated an area of low uptake (grew from 2.6 to 3.8 SUV) in my spine. It looks like it covers about 1/3 of T9 vertebrae. I met with the RO today. At first he kind of scratched his head and said no immediate reason to treat unless there was significant pain. But after the end of a 1 1/2 hour visit he did say that I could be at risk of a compression fracture so he would have no problem treating it with SRT if I decided to do it. Or we could just monitor it and see if increases by doing a CT scan in about 2 weeks (30 day span from PET/CT). My dilemma is (and please chime in with any opinions) 1. Do I take this as an indication that Femara is failing and switch to another med, and not radiate? 2. Do I just radiate this one area and monitor markers and scan and stay on the Femara, hoping that this one spot is all that is active? 3. Do I change meds and also radiate hoping to reduce the chance of fracture, and decrease pain? It seems like both my onc and RO and not favoring one clear path over the other. Keep in mind I had many mets at diagnosis in the bone, ribs, spine, GI tract. So the chance that there are other \"smoldering\" areas out there that just aren't lighting up on the PET scan yet. And I do have unexplained abdominal pain in addition to the back pain. My 2nd opinion specialist can't see me until July, but her nurse said she could run my chart by her. She specializes in breast cancer, whereas my onc (and all those here) are all general oncs that treat all kinds of cancer. I just feel frozen because I don't want to make the next move until I am sure it's the right one, and nothing is really standing out as the best alternative. Help!",

I also know he is aware that we consult with a Dr in Seattle who specializes in breast cancer research so he has said in the past that \"X\" ( and I I don't remember what because it was a long time ago) would be something that would leave my specialist thinking our local cancer center was really in the backwoods if he were to do it, so I think that is always in the back of his mind.

After CT scans, MRI and PER scans no primary tumor was ever detected. The mets had spread to my bones and GI  tract. The cancer was diagnosed by a bone marrow biopsy. Since it was er+ I was out on tamoxifen, and I did 2 rounds of chemo. I found out later that perhaps the chemo may gave been unnecessary,  that giving the tamoxifen time to work might have been sufficient.  But I was so sick from the GI mets that I lost 25 lbs and did IV nutrition because I couldnt digest food. I am 48 and have had 5 children at home so I wanted to do anything and everything available to me. The good news is that I am much better, my last scan in July showed marked improvement, and although tamoxifen failed after 7 months I am doing well on the next AI, Letrozole (Femara). Although a Stage IV cancer diagnosis is a huge shock, having only one tumor in a limited area, I think you are in a really good place. There are a lot of treatment options available to you and I know one friend who has had this for 19 (good) years. If it can happen to her, it can happen for us also.

I am er/pr + her -. I had mets to bone (rib pain) and mets to the GI tract. I was put on Tamoxifen and did two cycles of Gemzar. I think they did the chemo because I was soooo sick and the tamox takes weeks to work. My tumor markers rose at first and then gradually came down so we arent sure how much the Gemzar helped if at all. I had an oophrectomy in April and a few weeks ago my tumor markers started to rise so my Dr switched me over to Letrozole last week. So right now I am just on Letrozole and Zometa. I am hoping it works, I had sure hoped to get more than 7 months out of tamoxifen before it failed. A couple of people mentioned chaning their diet. Can anyone share what they have done? I find it so ovefwhelming when I begin to read about different things I wonder where to start!",

My MO has suggested switiching from Femeara to A/A due to progession on an area in my spine. He shot done Faslodex or Arimidex. He did give me a referral to a RO to talk about radiation to the spine. I did that last week. He does a single targeted dose which sounds live Vero or is similar. We talked for 1 1/2 hours so my eye began to glaze over with all the details. But he did say I would need an MRI before he did anything to make sure I was a candidate. I asked who needed to order the MRI and he said he could or my MO. So I would think the place in Florida could order an MRI anywhere and have the results sent to them. I get frustrated too, because I have a specialist in Seattle who reviewed my chart to see if she had any recommendations. I want to stay on Femara as long as possible and then maybe do Faslodex. She just went along with my Dr. Had I actually met face to face maybe I could have felt better that she really knows whats best for me. But I think she just thought A/A is the next step and that's that. My MO actually listens, and who knows if I put my foot down and said I want Faslodex maybe he would say OK. But I feel like they are the experts, so I feel like I should go with what they say. But I am struggling with day to day life right now, if I had any of the bad side effects from A/A things would be at a standstill at my house, I have 5 children and I can't take any unneeded risks. It is so hard, but we really need to be a strong advocate for ourselves because no one else can do that. We know what is best for us, and we need to feel confident that we are doing all things possible. I am just not getting that feeling at this moment for myself, so I know I still haven't reached the right decision.",

Even though we know that it is important to use our energy to focus on what is important to our kids and family it is hard to come home from a day of driving them to games or activities and then come home and be faced with a messy house and hungry kids. We have had several fun trips this summer, but then the post vacation let down is hard to deal with emotionally as well as the extra laundry piled up on the floor. Oh well! I struggle to stay \"in the moment\" and contstantly remind myself that being a mother is the most important thing to me......and the weeds in the yard or cleaning the house isn't as much as a priority as spending time with my kids. And it doesn't seem fair that we can't do both, but I for one, do not have the energy to live the life that I used to. Or the one I still hope to have. I do see an increase in energy and I think it is a positive sign that my tumor markers are stable or slightly decreasing. Whatever it is, I will take it! Stella-I don't know what meds you are on, but maybe there is something that can help. I take Lyrica to help with the joint/muscle pain from the Letrzole(Femara). And because I often have a hard time sleeping, not to mention waking up with anxiety and hot flashes, I often take a Xanax before bed. Getting a good nights sleep is so important. I can't function without sleeping well. Also because I expressed concern with my Dr while describing being sleepy while driving long distances,he prescribed some form of Ritalin. I don't really like it, for me it just gives me instant anxiety, but I have used it a couple of times and it worked. So don't be afraid to ask your Dr for other meds. I often research to see it something might be useful and then I present it to my Dr. He has been very receptive so far.",

I find it is so much better when I get out of the house, but I don't want to commit to something on a regular basis. I guess I am wary of over extending myself (I used to do this a lot) and right now I just really want to put my family first. Kjones-I have a wonderful husband. But he works a lot, and since I have been a stay at home mom for years I really feel like I am the one in charge of everything at home. But things have shifted a bit, and my older kids do help out a lot. I just want them to have a \"normal\" childhood, so I do find myself over compensating, or being more lenient on things than I probably would have been a few years ago. I think more about how they are going to remember me. Are they going to remember me as the mom who yelled about the towels on the floor, or as  the mom who takes them out for slurpees because it is Friday? I think living with cancer makes us much more conscious about what we do and how others perceive us. At least it has for me. I just wrote a post on another thread about a lunch I had with friends yesterday. It was just uncomfortable. They talked about cooking and going out with friends, and things that just are kind of beyond me right now. I am happy when I am able to get the kids up, dressed, lunches made, and off to school on time. Groceries in the house and dinner makes me happy. I want so hard for my children to not have to think about cancer, or think about me being sick. I do take time out though, yesterday I kind of retreated to my room and took a nap and watched Netflix. I told the kids I had a headache....which was more of a mental headache than a physical one :) I just get worn out sometimes and need a break. And my husband (I think) has kind of learned this pattern from me. I get overwhelmed, I retreat, and the next day I can ususally look at things in a different perspective and tackle what needs to be done. Or not. But at least I feel better. It is hard knowing that while I feel good right now......that can change at any moment. And my friends and even family don't even think about it. And that is a great divide between me and them. I look OK so to them I am OK. But my priorities have shifted and I think I just can't relate to them in the same way, I think that's why the lunch left me in such a funk. Oh well, today is a new day and I really don't want to go down that road again. I hope you have a nice day :) Diane-The area I live in is too small, there isn't much help available unless I can pay. There is help for the elderly or disabled, or maybe someone in an acute crisis but I am not really eligible here. I have a great social worker at the cancer center who I rely on when I really need someone to talk to. Kite-My tumor markers started to rise in June, so we did an PET in July. It was good, and then my markers have started to fall again. So I know what you mean about being in a funk. It is hard to relax and not think about it. That's why I take it one day a time, or if that's too much, just moment by moment. I think it is so important to support each other, otherwise there really isn't a place where I feel like people understand me. Hugs to you!",

What I have found in the almost 2 years of living with this is that kids are incredibly resilient. Once they kind of figure out what is going on, how you are doing, and how it will effect them, things can kind of run along even if you are still a jumble of emotions. It is so incredibly sad, so much so that I have a really hard time when I start thinking about it too much. The Social worker at the hospital just gave me a book about journaling with stage IV cancer. I have only begun to read it, but I think the premise is that it can be incredibly therapeutic and healing. I don't think it is for the kind of journaling one might do to leave memories behind for loved ones. So I may give it a try. I can't seem to open the journals I have bought to write in for my children, but since I can think of this as a therapeutic tool it might help. Especially since I don't really have anyone I can really pour out my feelings too. Looking at my friendships while I have a lot of friends, I don't really have one I feel like I can sit down over coffee and really have a heart to heart talk. And it would be too taxing to do with family memebers, I don't want to put that on them. So maybe my thoughts and emotions on a blank page that I can destroy later might be a good thing. Food for thought anyway.",

After I posted on here I went to fb and it was big reality check. Two families, one that I know and one in our community had tragic things happen over the last few days. It was a reminder that we all suffer, life is full of suffering and it is just a part of being human. I may not like the suffering which has befallen me, but if it weren't cancer it could just as easily be something like that which effected those two families. (I could provide details but I think you have enough on your plate) and their lives were changed in an instant. What we deal with is longer lasting, and having children provides us with so much joy......and so much worry. So for me, that fb visit reminded me to find joy in the daily things, a cuddle from my son, laughter from my children, enjoying the sunlight on these beautiful Fall days. Living in the moment and leaving tomorrow to take care of itself. A daily struggle to live in the moment, it doesn't come natural for me! I am much more of a planner. While most people would see me as a laid back, relaxed person, I have a side of myself which is constantly planning and looking ahead. I have had to redirect it to learn to appreciate the moment instead of planning the next step.  Last school year I did a lot of sleeping during the day also. This year I have more energy, maybe from the Femara, who knows but I will take it. I agree with trying so hard to be \"on\" all the time. I try so hard to pretend things are as normal as possible for my children's sakes. If I nap I usually tell them I have a headache. Or I will give myself a needed break and watch Netfilx in my room afterschool while they are watching TV or doing homework. I find the weekends easier since my husband is home. But I try to maintain the normal level of activity.....which means going to kids soccer games, football games, etc. And I also end up exhausted on Mondays. Are you still doing chemo? Because the fatigue from that is so awful. Has your Dr mentioned Affinator/Aromison combo? I think my MO said that would be my next step. I have a PET scan repeat on Thursday so we will see what comes of that. I am happy on Femara, I have figured out the side effects and I really don't want to have to switch treatments. Thanks for talking to me, I needed it today :)",

I guess I kind of feel like whenever I feel like that is needed I will know. So far I keep trying to keep a normal life, but have told them all that I am changing medications and I'm not feeling so great. I think they are kind of used to that :) And I am having radiation done to a lesion on my spine in the near future, so we have talked about that. It is sad to me that these kinds of things (medications, scans, radiation) is all becoming \"normal\" to them. Cafelovr-one of my dd was 8 when I was diagnosed, she is is now 12. She was really like that for a while, and even slept on our floor off and on for months. The social worker at the cancer center kept telling me that wasn't good and I was worried so we made an apt with a counselor. DD was not receptive to the idea and refused to speak to any of us during the apt. So I just went with my intuition and gave her lots of hugs and let her spend time with me. She got over it and now spends time alone in her room with the door closed :) So I think different kids process things in different ways and just being open to them is the most important thing. We are having a great summer here. I recently changed from Femara (it was failing, my tumor markers were rising and I had a spot on my PET scan show up on my spine). So I started Aromisin/Afinitor last week and I am even more fatigued than usual. But I am determined to enjoy the summer. I guess I will try to fit in time for some radiation, but I am just waiting for the RO to call me. I don't have 2 weeks in a row that I was planning on being here in town, we have a couple of vacations coming up and I really don't want cancer to interfere with my vacations anymore than it is already. Barb-I try never to look at statistics. There is no reason to think we can't be the ones who have successful treatments ahead of us, and I remind myself that medicine is coming up with things quickly. it is so important for me not to sink into depression or anxiety.

And then he tells me my tumor markers have risen :( So I am scheduled for a PET scan next month but he is talking about switching to Avastin/Affinator next month if the markers are still up. I just feel like I had gotten used to Femara and it's side effects and now I am back on the roller coaster. I am less than 2 years into this diagnosis and I have already used up Tamoxifen and Femara. I feel like this doesn't bode well for the future, and I am trying hard not to lose my optimisim. And what really, really sucks is that summer has just started. My oldest daughter is home from college. I had really looked to relaxing and enjoying this summer, last summer I was still sick from my GI mets and worrying about tamox failing and starting up Femara. So here I am again. Almost in the same spot as last summer, feeling like I am burning up my options. I could use some help, experience, inspiration,.....anything you have to offer.",

As you said, I have been here before and I found a way to go on, and I will continue to find that way. I know you understand, that's why I came here for support. I have tried to find support in different ways, but mbc patients differ from other advanced cancer patients because often we have many treatments available to us. So we are looking at running a marathon, not a sprint. That has been hard for me. Other cancer patients have the hope that their treatment will end, we know we will always be on some type of med. The rollercoaster never stops. The anxiety might lie sleeping for a while, but every test and Dr visit or just a random thought can wake it up again. I just haven't been able to find anyone who can really relate to what it is like to have mbc and be a parent. The other mbc patients I know in real life have older children, out of the home. They can't remember the days when everyone still relied on mom to make sure dinner was on the table, or at least food in the refrig. Or try to keep track of everyone's summer activities and jobs. I want my kids to remember having a mom who was there for them, so I try to make life as normal as possible. In a way that is good, it helps keep me present in the moment. And I love that I can come here and have instant understanding. I will reread your post Virginia, thank you for your words. I feel like they came straight from your heart :)",

My two high schoolers, freshman and senior are on their own schedule since they drive. That is nice I have to admit! And my college girl is home for 3 more weeks. I am trying to enjoy every last minute of having her home. She goes to school 4 1/2 hours away and I miss her terribly when she is gone. Good luck everyone!",

If my monthly tumor markers are good I feel like I hit the lottery and give a huge sigh of relief and make myself really appreciate it :) Sports can be so good for all of us. It gives the kids an outlet and an activity that focuses on themselves. And it give us a reason to get out of the house and celebrate our children. But it can be tiring too, so I try to plan ahead with crockpot dinners, pizza or tacos on the way home, or just something so I am not overwhelmed at the last minute with hungry children and husband :) That way I can also enjoy the game too. I try to make it to as many games as possible...just because. Although there are times where my inlaws will step in and take them. I have just promised myself to try to never miss any possible moment. So even those icky things that I could avoid (fall sport meeting...not my favorite) I go with a smile on my face and feel a huge sense of accomplishment because I did it ! I was there! Kind of silly, but my mind works in that direction these days. And I am with you there about picking your kids up from school and all regrouping on your bed. I have done this many times! Now that I am feeling better it's not so much. I am more likely to be downstairs so the kids are in the kitchen or family room. But last year, we spent a lot of time on my bed! I am sorry that your husband is working in a different state. That must be so hard. I hope you are able to arrange to be back together again soon. Like you said, one minute at a time! I am trying to rally for our last summer trip. It is with my family and it will be a lot of fun. But we need to pack food so I have to decide what to get and go grocery shopping and pack the coolers. The county fair is also here, so my kids are all wanting to go tonight, plus soccer and football practice.........meaning I will be doing most of the packing :) Oh well, it is always fun when we get there. And I try to let my energy level dictate how much gets done. It might be just the basics this year. But last year at this time I so unsure of the future it hurt to even think about this year. And here we are, and I feel better than I did. Another reason to celebrate!",

      "Content": "Sep 2, 2014 02:37PM starbrightlyshines wrote: Hi Liz, I hope you had a good weekend and are feeling ok. Wow. My 6 year old said something that took my breath away this morning. We were cuddling on the chair before school and he started talking about how glad he was that I didn't have cancer anymore and I could go skiing again, etc. I try so hard to make life seem as normal as possible that in one way it is good that he thinks I don't have cancer. But I also talk about taking my medication, and going to the dr. I don't want them to constantly be worried about me and thinking about cancer. But at the came time I thought that by knowing I still have cancer it wouldn't be as much as a shock to them when I have to switch treatments and deal with new side effects. So I had to take a moment, take a deep breath and explain to him that I still have cancer, I still take meds, but right now I am feeling really good.He looked a little confused and then said \"well but you don't have those hoses in your arm anymore so that is good\". He was talking about several months ago when I was so sick with GI mets that I had to do IV nutrition. So I get where he was coming from. But it's still painful. Speaking of painful, my teenage daughter brought up how awful a particular holiday was right after I was diagnosed. I made the observation that I don't really remember much of that time and that it is really hard for me to talk about that time. She said \"well how do you think it was for us\". We were having a really nice lunch out with my mom, sister, sis in law, and my other teen daughter. I just said, \"this is going to make me cry right now, I can't talk about it. You can talk to each of these people at this table about it later, but I can't talk about it right now\". She understood, she wasn't trying to be mean, she was just being a teenager and remembering for her how awful it was to have a mother who was so ill. That was a very touch and go time, I had lost 25 lbs and I couldn't keep anything down. Of course we were all scared. And I think we did a good job of supporting each other at that time. But I think my husband and mom kind of insulated me from having to deal with the children's fears, because I really could not have dealt with one more thing. I gave them lots of hugs and cuddles, but I put on a brave face for everyone, including myself. So I understand now that thoughts and emotions from that time will come up. What surprises me is that I really still can't deal with thinking of that time and talking about it. I hear of others who can face the emotions, who don't want to take meds to soften feelings. But I am the opposite. What my daughter didn't realize, and what I want to tell her later, is that the thought of having to leave my family is more than I can bear. I deal with the thought of my death. But to think about leaving them, and the pain it will cause.......I hear about people who lost a parent and it became a turning point in the wrong direction. How do we help our kids so that doesn't happen? Can we do anything at all? Perhaps when my health is really failing it would be the time to say something, but even then what would I say? I hate this. That's why I have bought journals with the thought of writing to them. But I can't get myself to even get them started. Has anyone started journals or leaving some sort thing behind? Today the social worker is trying to restart a Stage IV support group. We had one going but we lost several member to lung, pancreatic cancers, and the group just kind of lost its direction. It is hard because stage IV breast cancer has many more treatment options than other stage IV cancers. And we are all so different. I know it bothered some women that I have small children at home, it was painful for them to see my struggle. And for those who are doing well, it can be hard to see someone whose treatment is failing and vice versa. I wish I could find a group that was just for stage IV breast cancer. It would be outside my town but I think I could really benefit. I still feel like an oddball.......I don't feel like I fit in with my old friends and the moms on the go at school, and yet my treatment is going well (at least it was at my last visit, LOL, we all know that can change in a heartbeat). So I haven't really found anywhere other than my family, that I feel like I really fit in. Hugs to all you mamas. I am hoping for a stress free back to school week for some, as well as those of us who are still trying to get back in the groove!",

I have a 7 yo son, he was 4 when I was diagnosed. He has learned that I just can't do things with him anymore, like skiing or even jumping on his new trampoline. It makes me nervous because I had so many bone mets that I am careful about what I do. He doesn't ask me to play much anymore, but like you, he comes up to my room and hangs out playing or watching Netflix on my tablet. He probably watches way too much TV, but having older siblings and not having other kids around to play with there isn't much to do. He has gotten used to having days where I am up and around, and days when I am in bed. It isn't the way I would like it to be, but I guess we just make the best of what we are given. The important thing is that we are here, we are involved in their lives, and they know they are loved. I remind myself of this all the time and that is how I get through it. Kjones-I have tried Ritalin. I asked for it because I had a couple of times driving long distances where I was so tired I thought I wouldn't make it home. But for me it produces instant anxiety so I haven't used it much because I battle anxiety anyway. But I did take a half a pill last weekend and tolerated it ok so I might try it again sometime. I agree with what you said about playing with our children, looking back my parents never played with us either so that does make me feel better! I do think there is so much pressure on parents, so many of my children's friends are involved in activity after activity. I have already had to say no to my 7 yo on a few things because I have to pace myself. And having older siblings, we are busy enough with their sports. But he did soccer and bb this year, so it's not really like he is missing out. I love our cuddle time, whether it is on the couch or in my bed. I just love the fact that he is happy with life, and doesn't think about cancer or worry about it as much as my older children do. Good luck with the surprise party, what a great idea! Fujimama-I also try to schedule around my energy, or rather try to schedule my energy around their activities, lol! So morning I try to rest because once school is out it's dinner, homework, etc. Even so, evenings are hard, even when I haven't done much during the day. My goal is to make life as normal as possible, for as long as possible. But like my daughter's  teacher told me \"there is no such thing as a normal family\", so I try to not feel guilty. I try to volunteer at school and drive on field trips. I used to be the parent that was always there. Now I just do it as much as possible and tell myself they will just remember that I was there, not how often. Katz-I can tell how much your daughter means to you, it's more important that we are there than it is what we do. This winter has been hard on us. The kids have been sick and we seem to just be passing things back and forth between us so someone is always sick. There has been a lot of tension in the house, my oldest daughter is home from college with mono/lyme disease and is taking some time off. We keep getting passed off from dr to dr and no real answers. My 18 yo is looking at colleges, and none are close to home. I keep getting colds and they knock me out, the stress doesn't help and I know it's not good for my body to be so stressed. I haven't been able to go to yoga like usual, so my joints seem to ache more than usual which just puts my mind into the \"it must be cancer\" mode. Its just been harder than usual, and I am feeling trapped. I've tried to reach out to a couple of people that know what my family is going through but they don't really get it I guess because I am not getting much response. Being told I am \"inspirational\" isn't going to help me when I feel like I can't handle anything else. But asking me out for coffee or even a follow up call or text would really help. I think we just live in a world where most people are so busy that they can't see much outside of their own lives.",

It was a nice time for all of us to be together. My 20 yo is currently at home from college recovering from mono and possibly Lyme disease....almost a year later we have no official diagnosis other than the mono. She has terrible fatigue and pain, she sleeps most of the day. Even on Vacation she slept most of the time and wasn't able to hike or swim much with the rest of us. It is so sad, and stressful to deal with this and my own cancer. We are currently waiting on a new neuro consult for her. Anyway it is always hard to come back from vacation and the weather is so cold here, my DH is working twice as hard to catch up and the teens are glad to be back with their friends. I did really well on while we were away, my energy came back and I cut way back on my pain meds. But I can feel the old stress creeping back in. I think a lot of this battle with cancer is mental and if effects me physically. Maybe I do need meds for depression..........I just feel like I don't need then everyday. Ativan does help with the anxiety and I don't hesitate to take it. Patty-I love the ice cream photos! Ice cream will always bring a smile to a kids face! Nights are always hard for me. If I don't take a Xanax I can't sleep, and as moms we cant afford to not sleep. So I take Xanax when needed :) I love the riding photots! I love animals but I am allergic to horses, so even though my inlaws live next door and have 2 horses I haven't ridden for years. My children used to ride, but they lost interest and I think it stresses my FIL too much to have the horses around the kids. Kjones-i know you were having a really hard time a few weeks ago. I meant to reply but got busy with our vacation. Sometimes even coming to this site is hard for me, even though I want to be here to be supportive, because I think no one else really understands us. Lbgal-i used to hate that phrase \"it takes a village\" but it is so true. I think now especiall,y I hope that I can look outside of myself to help my children have a healthy network of support. And welcome to the new mom with the 3 mo. It doesn't seem fair to have young children and have cancer. My youngest was 4 when I was diagnosed and it broke my heart. He didnt understand anything other than I was really sick (I was diagnosed with GI and bone mets from the start), but he was used to sleeping with us and all of a sudden he couldn't anymore. And the other children were all so scared, it is really painful to remember that time. But now 2 1/2 years later things are much more normal than they were back then. Hopefully they don't even think of cancer much anymore, although they know I go to the Dr monthly and take meds. I just want them to have as normal a life as possible.  ",

And the school stuff.....it's always a work in progress to get them to think about their grades at any age! Well ladies, I am enjoying the sunshine today, and my mood seems to be on the upswing. I made it to yoga :) I am still on the fence about the antidepressant. I hear some take Lexapro or Celexa. Or maybe it's just more of an anxiety thing and I should just ask to try Buspar.

I have an appt with a RO to discuss radiation to the one area in the spine next week. I will ask if he feels if it something that needs to be treated or if it will help with the pain. MY MO felt we should think about switching to A/A combo since it is possible Femara is failing since the spot on my spine has been there for 7 months and is slightly larger (SUV change from2 to 3). There are no other visiable mets on the PET, but I do have pain in my spine, ribs, and lower abdomen. All places where I originally had mets so I find pain is unreliable to use as a marker for whether or not there is progression. But I have a busy month ahead with one daughter graduating from high school, we had planned a big party and I have a lot of cleaning and yardwork to do. So we put off a decision about the med change until the end of the month. Now I am thinking I would like to enjoy the summer without worrying about new SE from a new treatment. So unless my tumor markers jump dramatically or I have a huge change in pain/symptoms, I may wait until the ends of summer before I decide on a change. The only drawback is the thought that I could be giving the cancer a chance to spread to other organs so that is still something I have to consider. In the meantime, it is a beautiful day. I have family coming from out of town this weekend so I need to get myself organized. I also need to do some serious grocery shopping because I have really slacked off in the cooking dept the last few months. So I am going to get up and try not to think about cancer!  ",

But as my Dr  has pointed out, there are several new drugs on the horizon that are promising for breast cancer. I just need to get back on track with appreciating each day and not looking too far into the future. But, as we all know, that is so much easier said than done! What plans do you have for the summer? Suzy-it will get easier. Like Kjones said, once you get a treatment plan in place you will feel better. My children have done really well, they know I take meds and they know I have Dr appts. and if they have questions I answer them truthfully, but in a positive manner. They don't ask much anymore.

Unfortunately, this cancer is in my GI tract and bones, so it could be flaring up again and I may not feel it yet. I have a new computer and I have no idea why it changed fonts. I feel so old when I can't keep track of new technology! Tara-I think it just changes as they get older. They kind of flow in and out of the house like the tide! And somehow if you are available to listen when they actually feel like talking, it is possible to still have a close relationship! I am trying to be calm about the PET scan, but I feel like am quickly running out of treatment options. I could use some good thoughts and prayers sent my way,",

But then the let down from coming home and seeing how fast the days fly by is hard for me. Last school year was hard for me, I had several mornings especially last fall, when it was all I could do to get up and get them dressed and out the door. I would put on my comfy clothes, brush my teeth and comb my hair and try to pretend everything was normal for them. I would drive them to school, and then often times cry my way home and go back to bed. It was a difficult year and I honestly had hope it would get better, but I didn't know. The fatigue can be so overwhelming. I watched a lot of TV because I it was so hard to do anything. And yet I need to do the grocery shopping, cook dinner, help with homework, clean the house, do the laundry etc. Everything still needs to get done and while the kids can help, it's not the same. And I felt so isolated. People are busy, they work and get on with their lives and it's hard for them to understand while I might look OK from the outside, I am no where like I used to be. I still don't know how to live with this diagnosis. I feel like some people have distanced themselves from me, and I don't have the energy to maintain many friendships. There is a stage IV support group in our cancer center, but it is for all kinds of cancer. I was the only one with children still at home. And we have lost several people to lung, pancreatic, etc cancers. I don't really know if it helps me to go or not because I often leave feeling worse than when I went. I did make a connection with another breast cancer stage IV woman. She is on her 19th year with it, and she leads a busy active life. She has been an inspiration to me. There is hope, and I make it through by concentrating on my children, trying to make their lives as normal as possible, and trying to live in the moment. I try to take it day by day and that is the only way I can do it without getting overwhelmed. And thankfully, I do feel better this school year. I have a little more energy than I did last year. There is always hope!",

I love the idea of the cookbook because it would contain happy memories. And food can convey warm, happy feelings so recipes and photos would be great. I think concentrating on the living now and making memories is so important, and it lets me off the hook when the guilt of too many photos on the computer, and baby books unfinished, seems to taunt me! Even doing an electronic book for a school year, vacations, or holidays would be great. And I get so stuck in \"it has to be perfect\" or done for every year. Nonsense! They will be happy with whatever we do, or the memories they have. Annie-How old is your daughter? I have a 6th grader, and it is a hard time for kids. But friends can be so important and I think it is great that you are talking about friendship with her now. Our school is small, and her class has a very small number of girls so a lot of the difficulty is due to that aspect. And one of her best friends at school is a boy also! I know a woman who has had stage IV for 19 years now, and they have been good, busy years. I almost think part of what keeps her going is her zest for travel, learning, volunteering, and friends. She has been an inspiration to me, and I think if it can happen for her it can happen for us to have many good years ahead!",

It's not a new thing, I think I have had it all my life but I didn't know that it was a problem until I had a problem with panic attacks several years back. I also find Xanax helpful, but mostly for panic attacks because it is quick acting but also doesn't last as long as some other meds. Once I was diagnosed with cancer my onc put me on Ativan which has a long lasting effect. I still take Xanax on occasion, but usually rely more on the Ativan for the daily anxiety. Our bodies build up a tolerance to these meds over time so it can be helpful to change them once they aren't as effective as they once were. Other than meds, I find distraction helpful. But when I am in a big anxiety/panic cycle this can be really hard to find something. Exercise is good, I find yoga is so helpful, the benefits linger long after the work out. It's a gentle yoga class but I still find it so relaxing afterward. I also have a little humidifier that I put scented oils in and that can really lift my mood...peppermint, lavender, whatever appeals to you. Right now my family is all fighting colds/congestion and I am using eucalyptus oil. Sending you peaceful thoughts, this isn't an easy path we are on.",

Kahlua-the beginning diagnosis is such a shock. I think I cried almost daily for the first year or so. I don't want to say it gets better with time, but in a way it does. Once you get started on a treatment plan and see all the women here who have been here for years, it really helps. I didn't realize a Stage IV diagnosis meant treating it like a marathon, not a sprint. Once I understood that analogy, and that it can be treated like a chronic condition, that helped change my perspective a bit. My youngest son was just 4 when I was diagnosed, he had just started preschool, and my oldest daughter was a senior in high school (plus 3 others in between :) ). I could not believe it was happening to me. I was diagnosed because of severe stomach pains that sent me to the ER, several days later I came home diagnosed with MBC. I thought I was healthy until then! But almost overnight I couldn't keep any food down and quickly lost 25 lbs. It was really scary. But after chemo and tamoxifen the mets shrunk and I improved. So there is hope, a lot of of it. You can PM me anytime to talk, sometimes it is just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other and just moving forward. Distraction helps, and so do anti-anxiety meds. MamaRay-sending you hugs. The emotional aspects are so hard. I am 2 1/2 years in and so grateful for each milestone with my family. My daughter just had her senior prom and we are deep in the middle of high school graduation plans. Everytime I get sentimental about her graduating, I just remember how I felt when I was diagnosed and it just makes me happy to be here to see it. My youngest son was 4 when I was diagnosed, he just turned 7. When I get overwhelmed by things I tell myself to just concentrate on this day. I can handle this day. I find I can handle today, and I'll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. I also put things off if I get overwhelmed.  Sometimes just giving myself a pass on returning a phone call or scheduling something until the next day really helps. And when I have a really bad day I will just give myself some quiet time in my room to watch Netfix (just a distraction I know, but sometimes I just have to give my mind a break). My children have kind of learned a new kind of normal at home, and although I wouldn't wish for it, it works somehow. At least for today. This is a crazy month so I am not looking too far in the future. Sending hugs to all of you mamas!  ",

I just typed out a post and tried to go back a page to make sure I didn't miss anyone and the darn thing got deleted! So I just wanted to tell you all I know this is a sucky thing to have cancer around the holidays. I try so hard to live in the moment and just immerse myself in the \"warm fuzzy\" holidays, even if I don't feel that way. I am just doing all I can to keep my mood up. Friday I walked around Walmart humming Christmas carols because I was so cranky and I was not in the Christmas spirit at all! And it helped a bit! I wish I could respond to all of you but my computer time is up. Wishing you all a great day :) ",

It usually seems like I take it most days, but then I will have several days in a row when I dont. It works well when I can feel the anxiety building, or when I get overwhemed emotionally, or even if I just cant sleep. It doesnt make me sleepy like Xanax does, and I cant really feel it taking effect. It just kind of evens everything out and makes me feel like I can cope. Sometimes I can find it hard to go out to normal things, like my sons basketball games, and it really helps me feel like I am normal again.",

I have a lesion on my spine (progression) that we are going to radiate. Then MO said I could stay on Femara and moniter Tumor markers and PET scan to see how the Femara is doing. He said the lesion on the spine is evidence Femara was failing, but he wasn't in a big hurry to change meds because I am doing so well on it. He did say some doc would change right away. I think he could go either way if I felt strongly. I am wavering. I would like to have a great summer with my kids feeling good. But I also don't want to give the cancer time to advance to another organ or flare up. So how do you weigh those 2 options? I feel like no one knows. And the next step he says is A/A, not Flasodex which I was trying to bring up. And my specialist in Seattle also says A/A. So I guess maybe we can hold Faslodex in reserve for when we need it, and think of it that way?",

My plan was to each of them a box. I wanted to put in their baby blanket, a childhood outfit, etc. Things from their past with hopefully alittle note attached. But then I wanted to add thing for the future. We gave my oldest dd a birthstone ring for her 18th birthday. So my plan is to get a ring for my other two daughters, wrap them up and put it into the box with a note for their 18th birthdays. For my daughter who isnow 10 I would like to get her something special for her 13th birthday, I just haven't come up with what exactly yet.I also want to put in letters for graduations, special occasions etc. I'd like a mix of tangible items they can touch as well as letters. I am having a harder time thinking of gifts for my sons (ages 5 and 14) than the girls, so I woukd welcome suggestions! I also bought a book called Memories from my mother, or something like that. I actually have 2 different ones. They ask questions about my childhood, meeting my husband, my parents lives etc.I thought it was important to have all those things written down because I have forgotten many things my grandmother told me about herself even though we were close and had many conversations. This is something you could even do with a friend helping you if the writing were difficult. I dont have my photos in up to date andin order and that is something that really bothers me. Baby books and school books are the same way. My plan is to really get going on them once school starts......I am far too busy living in the moment, enjoying every last bit of summer that I can to do them now. But it will be a huge relief to have them done and I think that sense of accomplishment is something I can look forward to motivate me. I tend to be a procrastinator, partly because I am always afraid I wont be happy with the end result. But my new motto is \"Done is better than perfect\" and I am making a conscious effort to live this. Maybe we could make a new thread for exchanging ideas and motivating each other? I would think there are others who are in the same situation. This is such a difficult time. I saw a social worker at my cancer center who strongly encouraged this when I brought it up. But I do better with things when I can talk them through and sharer the accomplishment of getting a step done here and there. And I really dont have anyone in real life who gets why its important to do this.......they look at me with a pained expression and tell me I dont need to worry about it right, that I should be thinking positive. But I know myself and doing these things for my children is positive and will make me feel better knowing I have left them good memories. Please forgive the typos....I still have a hard time typing frommy tablet!",

I went to the ER one night for stomach cramps, was admitted, and came home several days later with a Stage IV diagnosis. I was so sick. I know very well how miserable it is. My youngest son was only 4 at the time, I had 5 children at home. My oldest was a senior in high school. Right away I asked for something to help me with the anxiety because as a mom with children, out thoughts are always on them and it was heartbreaking. So please, ask for some Ativan or something, not only is it physically hard to be so sick but emotionally it is so stressful and you need to be able to rest as much as possible while you are trying to get well. At this point my body couldn't digest food and I lost a lot of weight. I had a PICC line put in and did TPN, it is like getting IV nutrition but gives your digestive tract a break. I was doing chemo and taking Tamoxifen so the TPN kept me alive while the chemo and tamox went to work killing off the cancer cells. It was right after Thanksgiving and I was in the hospital for several days. It was such a low point, please listen to me and know that I was right where you are. I was so scared and didn't know one single person who had Stage IV cancer, I had no idea what was going to happen or that people could live years with this condition. Here I am three years later and so much better than I was back then. My youngest son is now 7. Hugs and more hugs to you. Keep us updated. I hope you are feeling better as I am typing this.",

I don't keep cancer a secret but I don't bring it up either. Well, usually. Last week I had a converstion with a new friend who has MS. So I brought up my situation. There was only one other person present, but now I am regretting it. I am an open, friendly person and I think that I just need to live my life as me, not letting cancer define me.
