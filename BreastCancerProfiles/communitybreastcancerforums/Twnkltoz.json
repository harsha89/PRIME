My skin is starting to break down under my arm and it was getting pretty painful--there would be a burning sensation when I put my arm down. Applying lotion helped for a short time. I did find the under shirts and that helps, as well as the hole-in-a-tshirt trick. Last night we tried something that also gave me some relief: I took a bath (not toooo hot but hot enough to be comfortable), and my fiance made some oatmeal water by just soaking quick-cook oats for about 15 minutes, then using a spoon to squish all the good stuff out of the oats and grind up the flakes a bit. Then we soaked a cloth (the rest of the t-shirt we cut up, actually) and laid it over my whole burn area and under my arm. The water was cool and it was very soothing. I re-soaked the cloth every 5 or 10 minutes and reapplied. It was quite soothing while I was in there, so we will probably do that every night until the burns subside after treatment. The nurse looked at my skin today and gave me some Mepilex, so it's funny timing that someone just brought it up. It has a mildly adhesive back, and she stuck it on under my arm to keep skin from rubbing skin. Instant relief from the burning sensation there. I alternate between Aquafor, 100% aloe (I actually found it at wal-mart!), and a homemade salve someone gave me made of comfrey, lavendar, and olive oil. Ugh...the itching is starting.",

Losing my hair (it's growing back, but it was long before and it'll take forever to get back there), losing a boob and the scarring, gaining 30 pounds, the pain and discomfort, losng all my fitness, not getting to dance for months... It all just sucks. A reasonable trade off for getting to live, but it sucks. And then a couple acquaintances died recently and it occurs to me that could have been me. And I haven't done enough with my life yet. Something I plan to remedy! Thank God today was my last whole breast treatment, and on to boosts. I have a huge patch of raw skin under my arm.

I'm signed up for the race again this year, so big motivator to get back out on the trail soon! It's not your fault this is happening, so go easy on yourself, but you're allowed to feel frustrated.
