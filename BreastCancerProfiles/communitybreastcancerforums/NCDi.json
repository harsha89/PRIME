Never had a pregnancy, so maybe I had too many hormones rattling around my bod. Had a hysterectomy age 35 - kept my ovaries. Took birth control pills for ten years, tried an IUD ... Until my bod started to expel it. That was interesting! Was prescribed Premarin in my early fifties. Didn't do so well - somehow got mastitis and then a lump, which turned out to be liquid. Took myself off Premarin, doc said I was setting myself up for more problems and should stay on it. Thank goodness I didn't. Fast forward to this year and after years of good mammos, my new reality. I drink a lot of water, love walking and gardening, eat healthily, very little meat but lots of white meat and veggies. But, I do love dark chocolate, especially Dark Reese's. I have a glass of red wine every few days and take a senior multiv it, calcium with D, fish oil and lutein every day. I drink coffee or black tea. And oh yes, the occasional blueberry glazed donut from DunkYD So, for some reason I developed a cell mutation but why is the great unknown. I haven't been stressed out about my diagnosis, when the doc told me I said that in the scheme of things, if someone had to cop for cancer, better me than a child. There is no b/c history in my family but I am the first female who didn't have children.  ",
