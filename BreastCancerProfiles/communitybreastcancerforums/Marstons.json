I seem to be sensitive to the temperature of the environment and will get the cold flashes when the environment is cool and hot flashes when it's warm. If only the opposite could be true! The hot flashes are a more very warm, clammy feeling. I don't get really sweaty and need to change clothes. I feel like I do have some restlessness at night. The hot flashes wake me up and then I sometimes have a hard time getting back to sleep. All in all I find the side effects annoying but tolerable.  I too was nervous stating Tamoxifen. It took me a week to get up the courage to take the first pill. A Tamoxifen pep talk from the genetic counselor helped get me going. Good luck. I hope that you too find it tolerable. It's worth a try.",

Then I just took the plunge and nothing happened. That was good. It took about 48 hours for se to kick in. For the first two days I thought I might be se free. Oh well.  Good luck! Christine",

The side effects have been pretty tolerable for me. I mostly have problems with cold and warm flashes. The first 48 hours were nothing, I hoped that might be a good sign. But then I started getting cold flashes and occasionally a warm flash. They were pretty jarring the first week, but have calmed down to more gentle onset. I don't notice them so much when I am busy. But as soon as I sit down or relax I notice them.  I've been really watchful of my weight because I was afraid of gaining. But so far I am steady and haven't gained.  One more thing. Right at 48 hours my gums started to bleed when I brushed my teeth. But that only happened once. I read that usually goes away quickly as your body adjusts.  I was a bit hesitant to start. I had the prescription for a week before I took the first pill. But my worst fears were not realized. It has been okay. Good luck to you! I hope you tolerate it well. ",
