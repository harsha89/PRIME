    "Content": "WinnerWinner wrote: I have completed neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with complete success per final pathology results. Because I chose a lumpectomy, I am to have radiation to my breast. However, my oncologist is undecided at this time as to whether he would recommend radiation to my lymph nodes. He said if he recommended lymph node radiation it would be because of my young age (38) and that I was node positive before chemotherapy. Of course he also wonders if lymph node radiation is overkill given that we know I converted to node negative. I do have the option to enter a trial where I will be randomized into one treatment or the other, but I don't know if I want to leave that decision up to the trial. If anyone had a similar decision to make how did you come to the conclusion you did? I'm leaning towards radiation of the breast and lymph node and since that would be me making the decision I would only receive 25 treatments versus the 33 under trial.
