Lots of dancing, singing, funny faces.  The kids will always have the memory of their mom being a big goof from time to time! lol  My daughter and I have been making silly faces in the mirror together since she was little! I had thought about leaving behind gifts for birthdays, videos offering advice for every situation but really I can do that in a journal...  Letting them know what I \"hope\" for their future and in the meantime teach them to be loving of others and of themselves.  Like someone mentioned above.. death is something of a process.. we all most move on.. move forward.. it's a natural process and really might be best that way..

I take a probiotic called Theralac and started up with my L-Glutamine. I have yet to have a visit with my ND on my new treatment. I have a visit on the phone with him on Thursday.

The concept was invented by a cancer patient (Mr. Kanzius).  He worked with a cancer/liver specialist at MD Anderson who is still/now heading the research there.  There is research going on in PA too I believe.  It doesn't harm healthy tissue whatsoever :)  They were injecting tumors with metal particles and putting the animal between 2 radio freqency machines.  The metal heated up but only affected the tumor/where the metal was placed.  No other tissue was heated at all.  Somewhere along the line there was a nobel prize winner who came up with nano-particles?  Please don't quote me on all of this.  Just going by what I remember (and I have some chemo-brain going on at this time!!).  So, one of the players (scientist, doctor, inventor) asked for some of those nano-particles so they could combine them with their research.  The concept was to attach these nano-particles/metal to antibodies that target cancer cells.  THEN a human, after given an iv of these metal/nano particles attached to antibodies that target all the cancer cells in their body, would stand between these radio active machines and heat up/destroy EVERY cancer cell!!!  We are already given targeted antibodies.. hercepton would be one example (right?).. so they just need to get these nano particles and antibodies to work together!  Whew.. hope I got all that right.  I just wanted to fill you in a little since you hadn't seen the video or read the research yet.  Hope that helped a little :) What's promising to me is that research has been going on, it \"has\" progressed \"and\" the FDA has approved the human sized machine!!!  That's big!  You can read more about it here too \"and\" vote to help raise $250,000 toward even more research for this amazing find!!!  www.refresheverything.com/kanziuscancerresearch",
