It was his opinion that the lidocaine was painful as well, so he doesn't really order them. What he did do (bless his heart) was order an injection of dilauded. I was already hooked to IV for surgery do I didn't even feel that. I ony have the briefest of memories of the tracer shots. Oh it did require an RN being with me, I'm sure some hospitals are reluctant to do it. The anesthgeolist (sp) can dea with the dilauded when he does the general in surgery.",

I cannot imagine going home sooner than I did.",
