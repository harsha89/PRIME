I havent had to take any stool softners yet and I havent needed anything stronger than Tylenol with neulesta shot so I guess you win some and lose some. But heard Taxol causes lots of bone pain so make sure to get stocked on pain meds for this one. Littlebird hope your ok and sleeping and that is why no posts lately.",

It is a steroid to prevent allergic reaction it is just so scary to have to take so many steroids before tx is everyone else doing this? And I officially am feeling sorry for myself I cant find anything to wear due to ugly port and no boobs I hardly ever wore makeup and now I have to take the time to put it on before I leave so I dont look pale...........AND some old guy at the Hallmark store told one of his associates to get a box for the lady on the goofy hat.

Going back to work Monday feeling kinda anxious about it I am not one who likes a lot of attention so maybe I should make a sign (Doing ok as for whats next moving forward and live life) does that cover everything? Am I the only one who gets annoyed with the \"whats next\" question? Doing the Herceptin weekly for a few more weeks then go to every 3 weeks. I am noticing some side effects with herceptin since I have been done with chemo for 3 weeks now. Went to do some research on Her2neu on this board and I am not alone the onc says its a breeze but according to the blog their are lots of women who would disagree. I think it should be required for the oncs to do chemo so they REALLY know how we feel. But I know that wouldnt be nice....but sometimes they just downplay everything so you dont freak. Ok done complaining.... I am so proud of us and all we have accomplished and conquered together. Those of you still going hang in there it does get better and believe me there were times I didnt think so.  We need to make a pact to post at least once a week so we can keep updated with how everyone is doing. I really enjoy all the posts and hearing about all that is going on in your lives. Hope everyone has a free s/e day",

I too just have whatever attitude my poor DH keeps wanting to make me something to eat but nothing sounds good. Our bad dreams will be over soon warriors and we will be proud of all we handled and withstood. I am cutting the hair off tomorrow as I dont think I could handle clumps at a time. Everyone tries to understand but no one understands like my fellow sisters you gals keep me sane. I am 40 married for 18 yrs highschool sweethearts 23yrs. We have a son 15 and a daughter 12. So far they have been troopers my son has a teacher at school that has been great with support since she had been through this 2 yrs ago and my daughter feeds off of me so staying positive. Tomorrow is a new day hope all is well for all.",

Feistyblug Sorry to hear your having a bad day tomorrow is a new brighter day for you. Keep your Warrior sisters on your side and you can get through it. dornet You should try some Claritin 24hr and aleve when you get your shot. I take that day of and for 2 days to follow and had no problem with shot. The oncologist explained as the shot affects your body like allergies would sending your platelets into overdrive causing the bone pain.  Its worth a try. coolbreeze So sorry to hear about Fudge being a fellow dog lover I know this is hard to take right now. My condolences go out to you and your family.",
