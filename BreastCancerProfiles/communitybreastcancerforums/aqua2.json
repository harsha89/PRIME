My doctors did not give me an option-and thank goodness they did not or I would have found away out of it (the scar is ugly, it may be uncomfortable, looking for port horror stories etc.) My first port experience was a duzy: swollen (newly inserted-so it was like bobbing for apples.)  As my surgeon placed the port deep, they discovered I needed a longer needle.  As all this was resolved on the 1st treatment, it's been uneventful since. Not all port craziness is the fault of the port, one surgeon placed a runner's port so shallow and on her bra line that the port worked it's way to the surface, she reported for chemo like there was nothing wrong-the oncologist removed it on the spot.  There have medical personnel who are rather clueless dealing with ports leaving the patient to believe the ports the issue-there are more than one type of port.  Make certain that notjust anyone is not attempting to deal with your port.   ",
