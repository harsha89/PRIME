    "Content": "bcuzhelovesme wrote: 3 weeks ago, I found a small dime size lump in my breast. Called and made an appointment for a breast screening. This took 2 1/2 weeks. In this time, the lump grew from dime size to 5 cm in diameter, begun having sharp pain (china man in there with a set a ginsu knives) in my breast and arm pit. Breast screening found the 5 cm lump that runs from surface of areola to almost the chest wall, rash on breast, inverted nipple, swollen/hard lymph nodes in my clavicle, arm pit and rib area. The two women who did the breast screening/pap exam expedited my application for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program and called to make my appointment with a surgeon for tomorrow. (This was last wednesday.) Why bypass the reg. doc visit and go straight to a surgeon?? In the time between when I found the lump and the exam, I had done a round of antibotics for a sinus infection. And yesterday started Levequin for pneumonia (ER doc wanted me to stay in the hospital and I refused.) Since wednesday, I've developed swollen ridging area's on my breast, mass seems bigger and looks bigger. I would say there is at least 2 cup sizes difference in my breasts now. I'm worried sick... and anxious for this appointment tomorrow. What can I expect?? Jen Log in to post a reply",
