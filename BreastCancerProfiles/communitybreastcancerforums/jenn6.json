I had an US & Mammo done the following week . The US didn't really show anything and the Mammo showed very dense breasts .Â Because the lump is palpable and I have a strong family history of BC , my gyno sent me to a breast surgeon who ordered an MRI. She said from day one that I had fibrocystic breasts and it was probably nothing. The MRI showed some areas of concern but just said to follow up with my doc and come back in 6 months for a follow up MRI. I really wanted to have a biopsy done just to at least have peace of mind but she didn't feel it was necessary. It's now 4 months down the road and I still have that lump plus another one that's been their for almost as long. My breast has changed shape tremendously and I'm very worried that it's something other than just Fibrocystic breast. I went for a 3 month checkup a couple of wks ago and she said it can be normal for a breast to change shape and wasn't concerned that the lumps are still their. I have to wait 2 more months for another MRI and I think I am going to get a second opinion. If you have a palpable lump I think you should definitly get an MRI or a biopsy. Something so you know for sure what's going on with your body. I hate that I have waited this long and have my breast look totally different than the other. I really don't know what it could be but I would settle for peace of mind. Good luck with everything and I hope you get some answers soon.",

      "Content": "jenn6 wrote: I was wondering if anybody has received a false negative or knows anything about them? I went in for my annual with my Gyno and they found a pea sized hard lump on my left breast. My doctor sent me in to get a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. Both of those showed no sign of a lump even though the radiologist, Dr. and ultrasound tech said they could definitly feel the hard lump. I am concerned because my mom has had breast cancer twice and I want to make sure that it's not anything serious. I know that 80% percent of nodules are benign so I'm relieved to have that on my side but think it's very odd that they couldn't find anything on the mammogram and ultrasound. Any help or info on this would be great. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

May I ask what you were diagnosed with excatly? Did you have to ask your Dr. to do further testing or did they recommend it on their own?",
