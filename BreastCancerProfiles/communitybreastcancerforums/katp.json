Several family members had had breast cancer and one aunt had had breast cancer in one breast and later in the other--two different kinds of breast cancer. I had skin sparing nipple sparing double mastectomies with reconstruction at the same time. I had saline implants. I did not do chemo but have taken Anastrozole for the past 3 1/2 years. I am doing pretty well except I am tired all the time and have some joint pain.",
