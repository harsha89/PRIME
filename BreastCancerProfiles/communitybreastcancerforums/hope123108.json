It got out through vascular invasion. I had a dbl. mast. however my Mom also died of bc some years ago and that scares me.  Now i know mast. won't save me once it gets out, i did not realize all this when i choose my mast. Kinda had to figure out my pathology on my own. Dr. was not very informative.  Would do things different if i could.  Take your time in making YOUR decision. Once they are gone that's it. Hope all works out for you!!",

Hope all turns out well with you and you are healthy.  Again isin't so amazing the info on these boards, i believe most of these women before i believe the Dr.  sad to say but they have been their, did that. Many conversations that would even come up in a dr. office never mind answers and conversation regarding some issues that one goes through. Love to you and your family, Hope",
