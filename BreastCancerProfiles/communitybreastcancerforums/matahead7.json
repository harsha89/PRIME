I have just been in a zone trying to accept everything and getting frustrated with the  response time from the PS , BS, getting pathology reports, Path clear DCIS no metasis Lymph nodes clear right breast showed signs of calcifications so glad I had BMX went to Onc and he is starting me on Arimidex for 5 years terrified of SE but so far I am only having terrible body aches been taking for a week today, had one headache dont know if from meds or just a headache that happened  wrist are painful and hands hurt and I feel like a old lady can barely get out of bed or move after sitting for a while. I had a hard time with drains finally got the last one out Monday after insisting because it was very painful and smelling really bad and now I have a rash under the fobb and skin on chest under that is itching like mad, I am 1 mo postop today surgery was on 10-11, still sore and just tired, had my first fill Monday was not bad did not feel anything but later that night felt the pressure and have been feelin it every since   TEs feel like rocks and I am having muscle spasms but will tell PS to prescribe something for it when I go for next fill on the 14th.  I am still having my moments where I just cry finding my self just wanting to be alone I have plenty of support but I dont want to be bothered is any one else having this issue ? Oh yaeh I cant sleep . I am still having the DIEP procedure but dont know when at first they said Nov, Dec now maybe Dec, Jan I just want this to be over getting more frustrated everyday sorry to come back bitc---- but this cancer and recovery stuff sucks.  I may not say anythinng but I am reading and praying .All in all I am blessed just have to remind my self that I went thru big ordeal and give myself permission to feel what I feel just not get stuck her feeling depressed and oh yeah anxiety and depression is one of the side effects of arimidex . Thank you ladies for letting me vent I am just in a bad place right now hoping everyday to feel like my old self again!!!!!",
