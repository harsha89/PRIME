I, along with my family, based on that number, decided to be aggressive, so I did have chemo. Though definitely manageable, I sincerely hope that your pathology is such that you don't have to have chemo.",

I was born in 1949, and no DES that we know of.  But my suspicion is that I was on birth control pills for 10 years that were very strong.  When I moved and found a new doctor, he asked why I was on such a strong pill.  There was no reason that I know of. All of the above could be coincidence, but my gut tells me there is something to it.  By the way, my mother is a 13 year survivor, and I just passed 3 years from diagnosis.  Every time I take my medication for 100% ER positive BC, I wonder if something will turn up down the road with health problems related to these meds.",

This morning, they have moved him to ICU and said his creatin count was 3.  The kidney doctor mentioned dialysis if things don't improve.  My question to any of you who have experience with carboplatin, did you have any issues with your kidney that improved?  His oncologist said he feels the problem is the dehydration not the chemo.  The kidney doctor said he thinks it is the chemo.  Any insights you can offer will be greatly appreciated.  I know this isn't breast cancer, but I really am looking for some honest answers.
