I feel the same way!  My surgeon really pushed the mastectomy when the margins weren't good after the first surgery.  I could not wrap my head around it either. I have the same questions about over-treatment and aggressive treatments. There seem so few answers about DCIS that we are all treated as if we had invasive breast cancer - which we don't have.  Whether it would ever evolve into that is questionable, too.  I struggle with all the same questions in this hellish experience and have come to the conclusion that the answers are deeply personal, require much soul-searching as well as learning/reading/asking questions.  Do what you feel is right (and wait to do anything until you know what that is!) and find a doctor who will respect and honor your right to make that decision.  I wish you much strength and courage in this process!",

I also had a great deal of fluid that, over about 6 weeks or so, drained naturally.  I am now 6 weeks out of 2nd surgery and getting ready to start radiation. It has been quite the trip and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the surgeon got it ALL!!!  Please keep us posted.  This forum has helped me tremendously, both to connect with kindred spirits and to learn!",
