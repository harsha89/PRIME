      "Content": "Jun 11, 2010 07:17PM - edited Jun 11, 2010 07:19PM by swanseagirl Hi Debbie, Wow, it sure is confusing.  Met with surgeon and went through pathology with fine tooth comb. He had already talked with an onc and radiologist and had researched other options before I saw him. He said text book decision would be axillary dissection.  However, he had spoken with both onc and rads and we are going to do chemo then rads on breast (had lumpectomy) and nodes.  If something further down the line reoccurs, an axillary dissection will have to happen. I was relieved that my surgeon had researched and talked with fellow professionals instead of throwing the  one option at me. I am still scared to death of what the future holds and I am looking at my glass as half full and with chemo and rads it will become a hell of a lot fuller. I have to hold onto to the fact these are professionals and they know what they are doing.  I meet with onc and radiologist next week. Even saying that, i had a huge meltdown last night.  All the desicion making is overwhelming. Do you ever get to the point where you can breatha and say this is going to be OK? Thanks, Jules",

I have enough to get bed hair but not enough to go outside without my wig.  If I'm walking I wear a base ball hat. Before that a scarf and baseball.  I love my wig and it gives me the confidence I need when I am around professionals. My eyebrows are growing at a snails rate. I can finally see eye lahses, blonde, but they are there. Hang in there xxxx Jules",

For those of you that are scared of chemo, please do not be.  I will be having my third next week. Hallf way there.  Is it enjoyable, no, is it doable yes.  For me it has been more than doable. We all have to make personal choices, but don't base not having chemo becasue you are afraid.
