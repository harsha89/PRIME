No one asked about my diet either. What type of antioxidants do you take? I take a few vitamins/minerals and I take quercetin, for allergies, turmeric and fish oil. But certainly not in any huge amount. I drink a greens powder thing and I drink matcha tea once in the morning. They didn't ask me what food or tea I drink or anything like that. I can't imagine it could make the radiation less effective unless it was in huge doses. Just my guess.",

I am not sure as I have never started a topic before, so I have never tried it. I use Green Beaver Day Cream for my moisturizer (it's Canadian). My dr. said to just use any cream that doesn't have a fragrance in it. He didn't have any specific ones to recommend (I asked). I also have some pure aloe vera. I work from home, so I can go braless too (also helps that my breasts are small). Although my treatment is on the right side, I still worry about my lung. They said not to hold my breath though. But they did tell me that a small part of my lung is still exposed to the radiation.",

I had pain yesterday evening in my breast (interior, not from the skin) and was disturbed by this and also felt pain in my stomach and was sort of disoriented a few min. after my treatment. But the pain was gone in the morning and I feel totally fine today. No skin irritations either. The technician told me that some people experience interior breast pain while others don't. I'm glad it didn't return today as it was not nice to start the first day of it with pain with 20 more to go! I actually cried on my way to my treatment today as I felt like I dreaded doing it again, if it was already bad on the first day. Yesterday I also felt like my treated breast was hot, but today, I don't notice this. I feel totally normal. I wonder if my body sort of \"adapted\" to the treatment. I'm doing 16 full breast and 5 boosts. How do you feel now, Barb, after 3 treatments? I don't have a Bolus. I haven't heard of this before. By the way, I didn't realize this was for May radiation in general (and maybe others did the same), so you may want to change the title to just be \"Radiation May 2019\" like the other monthly posts as the way it is makes it seem like a specific post to just your issue.",

I've done 8 treatments so far of full-breast radiation, so I'm half-done now with that as I have 16 treatments (then 4 boosts afterwards). I have a break today as they are calibrating the machine. I had pain the first day (in the evening), but not after that. The nipple seems sensitive and the breast sometimes feels a little hotter than the other one and firmer. I don't have any changes in the skin. I use cream by Green Beaver which is aloe, plus other ingredients (no fragrance) just after treatment and before I got to bed (and twice per day too on the weekends). Basically, I still feel normal with a tiny bit of over sensitivity in the nipple. Hope it stays like that! Fingers crossed, knock on wood! With people who are having nausea afterwards. I didn't have that, but I had a weird feeling and stomach pain right afterwards ONLY on the first treatment. I now make sure to eat 1.5 to 2 hours before the treatment and not closer than that and never had a stomach issue again. Not sure if that is the reason or not, but I think having a full stomach could possibly affect how you're feeling afterward. Although Haliday, it seems you said you were hungry, so you must not have eaten right before it.",
