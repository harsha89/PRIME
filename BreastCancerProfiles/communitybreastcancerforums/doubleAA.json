      "Content": "doubleAA wrote: I am a survivor just over a year now (history below). My MIL a 30+ year survivor was just diagnosed with ILC in her remaining breast (had a mastecomy 30 years ago no reconstruction). At that time she did not need radiation,chemo or hormone therapy. The current cancer is in her nodes as per the petscan but no other evidence of spreading. She will need radiation but the doctors are saying no chemo as she is 82 and the cancer is very slow growing. She is in Florida we are in NY. So my question to you ladies who have had radiation is - my kids 18 & 15 would like to send their grandma a care package, what would you recommend we include. I want to get her a small pillow ( mine was given to me by the hospital I was at and I'm going to Try to find out if I can purchase one from them and a seat belt cover). I've been reading a lot of posts and noticed you mention creams, is this something we can send or is she best getting whatever the RO suggests. If we can send, then is there a specific brand I can pick up at a local drugstore. My kids got me queasy drops and they worked. Is nausea an issue with radiation. I noticed a lot of women said fatigue towards the end. Any suggestions you have would be great. Her surgery is a week from this Tuesday and even though I know radiation won't start right away I'd like to get the care package to her before surgery.

      "Content": "Dec 27, 2012 02:12PM - edited Dec 27, 2012 02:13PM by doubleAA For some reason, whenever I have to talk to someone (checkout operator at supermarket, taxi driver, whoever) I have an almost overwhelming desire to burst into tears and tell them \"I've just been diagnosed with breast cancer\". Why the whole world needs to be privy to my problems I'm not too sure, but that's the way I'm feeling right now.  I am just past my one year anniversary and when I read this I wanted you to Know I was like this too. I found it easier and cathartic to tell the Clinique salesclerk why I was looking for a new lipstick then to tell a friend or loved one. Each time I told someone it made it more commonplace until one day I was able to say I have breast cancer without welling up or crying. It gets easier as treatment plans get set in place and once you start on your course of treatment. I didn't take anything to get me through nor was it offered. With chemo I was prescribed Ativan which was only taken 1x a day at night and I took it reluctantly at first. It helped me sleep after taking the steroids and I guess calmed me down as well. My doc even said it had an antinausea benefit. Do what you need to do and what is right for you. That's the number one rule I learned from this experience. Good luck to you.",

My MO said that the benefits of Tamoxifen stays in your body for 30 days. He also told me not to \"freak\" if I forgot to take a dose every now and then because it stays in the body for 30 days. Hope this helps you.",

A few things my breast surgeon said that ultimately helped me make my decision was 1) my breast surgeon said that if she removed the breast without cancer that she would want to take a lymph node for testing on the \" non\" cancerous side. 2) that I needed to be 100% secure in my decision to remove my \"healthy\" breast because there is no going back, but if I was not 100% sure that if is something that could always be done at a later date ( not that I would have wanted more surgery) 3) that by removing the healthy breast, I actually opened myself up to complications, there could be complications with the tissue expanders, lymphodema etc The decision is personal and you've got to really think about what you want. I had a good breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. Dressed my girls look good. Naked I've got one natural breast and one foob, but it doesn't bother me in the least. As I said, I am a little moe than a year out from my UMX and six months from my reconstruction. I was very lucky and had minimal side effects. I did have some cording after surgery that needed pt to get my range of motion back. The issues that bother me a year out are, numbness under my arm from the lymh node removal (have been told this can take two years to go away or it may never) lack of strength on my surgical side, and the fear of lymphodema. So yes with those three things being said and now that I have some hindsight I am glad I only did a UMX. I do have some fear of getting breast cancer in my natural breast but for now, I can live with that.",

Good luck with everything.",

I was another one of the odd ones I guess not much pain just some discomfort. Soreness like after the hardest weight workout you ever did. But even if you have more than this there are pain meds to help. You don't mention if you are having reconstruction. I had a unilateral on the right side. When you come out of surgery you already have a surgical bra on. I was not ready to \"look\" right away. My breast surgeon helped me with that the next morning when I saw her. I am small busted and had a TE placed so I had a breast mound. She opened the surgical bra just slightly at first and showed me that I still had for lack of a better word cleavage (cause when you're a 34a there really is not much). Then she opened it a drop more and I was able to see my skin. I think after looking at too many mastecomy pictures on the web I forgot it would still be me. I saw my freckle that I have on my right boob and was like cool. I was so much more comfortable. I could not see the scar from looking down. It did take me a few days to look head on and at that point it was totally fine. The scar at first is very red. But this gets better. Do your range of motion exercises. You won't want to but you will want full mobility back and this is how you get it. Any problems you are having with them make sure to convey to your surgeon. I wish you the best of everything!",
