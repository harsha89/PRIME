    "Content": "mystyle2care wrote: Hi all, My gyno recently found a lump in my right breast during a routine annual. I'm 29 years old and had an US and biopsy just this past week. Am currently waiting for biopsy results. The radiologist things that its likely a fibroadenoma but I tend not to believe anything until test results come in. My mother passed away of BC and my grandmother also had the disease. That's why I'm incredibly freaked out. My sister and boyfriend are incredibly supportive but I'm scared of the disease b/c of how I've seen it manifest in family members. On top of that, I was diagnosed with malignant cells in my throid when i was 22 and had a full thyroidectomy. I'm so freaked out, broke down in tears before the biopsy (thankfully the bf was there to comfort me)Â and am preparing myself for the worst (not sure if that's the best thing to do or not) Does anyone have any words of advice? Also, has anyone thought about doing genetic testing? - would love to know of any pros or cons to this. Thank you for your time, attention and advice to this post. Log in to post a reply",
