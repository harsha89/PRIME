The Dr is pretty confident that the tumor was just in the breast and he said the only way for a tumor to travel and spread is through nodes or vascular, so my question is, if it was not in either of those, why do chemo? I was so nervous and forgot to ask, will on next apt. Dx 5/2/2016, IDC, Left, 6cm+, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 0/12 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 5/3/2016 Mastectomy: Left Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "melissa233 wrote: i was diagnosed stage 3 invasive ductal carcinoma with necrosis. Dr. said stage 3 is based on size only since i had 0/12 nodes involved. My tumor was 13.5 cm ulcerated. Is that strange for a tumor to be that big and no vascular or node involved? Not complaining just think some of the findings are odd. Also it is ER-, PgR- and KI67 of 95%. HER2 test is borderline. She also said she felt like it was more of a \"surface tumor\". What exactly does that mean? Not much was told to me so i am guessing i have a bad prognosis.
