I did a lot of unnessary research on the net that made me worry unnecessarily and only this site made me feel better and more confident that things would be benign. You are all awesome and thank you. I'll sleep well tonight",

She wants to go on birth control so she can be more in charge of her cycle, her only reason for this is because she is a state softball pitcher and a year round player. She hates having to deal with a period when she has important games. Her Ped. thinks that birth control would be a good choice for her. The dilemma is that she has to start the pill this Sun. due to her cycle. Her Ped. said she wants to see her in one mo. to do another breast exam and see how the pill is working for her. My daughter's goal is to go on the pill and have normal periods for two or three months like the Ped. suggested and then skip them for the summer months. The Ped. thinks this is all a good idea. I called the Radiologist last night and asked her if birth control will make the fibroadenomas grow. She said she doesn't know if my daughter has the regular common fibroadenomas or juvenile fibroadenomas that the juvenile ones can sometimes grow more rapidly. She said we don't know because we are at step 1 right now. She said to have her start the pill if she wants to and to see the Ped. in one month. I am not convinced this is a good idea. I don't want to go in for her Ped. check in a month and find out that the fibroadenomas have grown because of the birth control pill and now they want to do more work ups on her, or suggest removing them during her peak softball season that she cannot afford to miss with important college showcases and possible scholarships at stake. What if birth control causes her to have pain with them? She is not having any pain with these fibroadenomas now. The radiologist said that she's probably had them for a couple of years already and even if there was the thought that they should be removed it would be total elective. Should I not have her go on the pill? Help I need some sound advice so I can figure this out before tomorrow. I'll be thinking about all of this while at her scrimmages today.......",
