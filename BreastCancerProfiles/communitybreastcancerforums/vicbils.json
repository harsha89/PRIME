Fri they gave me Kytril, Ativan and Nexium, along with a compazine supp, which finally seemed to do it(I thought!). Yesterday, I ended up calling again, and they told me to stay on the Kytril, and also use the zofran. This am, feeling a bit better, but still that boarderline crap feeling. I must say...this \"invincible\" woman was not prepared! But....1 A/C down...3 to go! Hope everyone is feeling good today, and thanks for listening! Vic",

I talked to my onc about work, and we compromised on me staying in a \"safer\" area (infection-wise) for the week after treatments, until I know my counts. I am fortunate that I can either be in the office or out in the field. Also, I have a very understanding and flexible supervisor, but I've been on the job for less than a yr, so am juggling time. I agree with the previous advise to check with your HR dept...there may be more flexibility than you've needed to knopw about in the past! I went in to work today, but only lasted 5hrs...still fighting this nausea, and the heat is not helping!! Hope everyone else is doing well...sounds like everyone's getting to the \"buzz\" stage...Not there yet, but soon, Im sure. Stay strong ladies!!!!!!",

And to think...only 2mos ago, I wouldn't have understood any of that!! I had a R mast on 3/18, and am seeing onco Dr today (wants to do chemo...I just don't know the regime), and then my cardio Dr after...some underlying heart issues, ECHO already done, and port scheduled for tomorrow, if I decide to go thru with this (after hearing heart specifics). If I do go thru with this...am hoping to get this show on the road in April.  Also had first fill yesterday...actually a bit more uncomfortable than I thought it'd be! Just wanted to join in...also, I was told no showering for a week after port insertion, and no lifting for 2wks...Just started back showering...this stinks!!",

I told them I want to wait til after Easter,so prob will start the mid-end of April I must say, I actually felt relieved once I had made my decision. Not looking forward to this (who does??!!)
