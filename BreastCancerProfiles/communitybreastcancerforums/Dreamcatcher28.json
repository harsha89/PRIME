I found a lump about the size of a marble at the end of June, that I swear came up overnight. I waited a couple of weeks to see if it was a cyst but it began to grow. I didn't have insurance at the time and was denied for Medicaid. It took almost two months to find a program that would take me (since I am so young) and they thought it was a Fibroadenoma, they set me up for mammogram and ultrasound and appt with surgeon but no rush. By the time I went for diagnostics two weeks ago it was measuring 5.5 cm. Surgeon still thought fibro but did biopsy to be sure. Called me next day saying I needed to see him immediately. Now 6cm and growing rapidly (In 34B its almost overtaken my breast). Met with oncologist Thursday and he wanted to start chemo immediately but of course have to wait for zillions of tests. Am most terrified about the PET scan on Friday. I don't think I can take any more bad news :-( Scheduled to start chemo on the 12th. Any and all support and or advice is welcome!
