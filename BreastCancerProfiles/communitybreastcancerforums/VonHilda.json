Disappointing news in one respect but great to have clarity, and it explains why my onc. said she would have to find me some more tablets by the time she retires in 10 years time. BTW, I have actually deliberately not called it Stage IV to my children (now 21 and 23) or mother as I don't want to de-rail them and what's in a label any way? hanks again for your comments!",

Last month I discovered it had come back to my lymph nodes in my neck and in my hip bone, and I'm now on Letrozole & Ibrance. I saw on paper that I'm now Stage IV, so my question is 'does treatment take me back to an earlier stage or remove me from being a Stage at all, or are you forever fighting it? Am I now always Stage IV? I'm keen to hear from people who were Stage IV and have changed status.

My main reason for not saying it so far is because I want to give them correct information rather than muddled or incorrect info. I was only diagnosed 3 weeks ago with mets and it took me a week before I realised it meant st. VI. With the answers you have all clarified I will now let them know.",

Initially I thought the racing heart was a reaction on the first night but that was just anxiety. The hives on the second night were due to a lack of hydration. Other than tiredness, I have noticed a bruise on my right breast which I will get checked out tomorrow. Anybody had this? Also I feel really quite chilly and was wearing a sweater all day today whilst everyone's else was in shorts and tee shirts as it was a hot day in London today. Anyone had this SE",
