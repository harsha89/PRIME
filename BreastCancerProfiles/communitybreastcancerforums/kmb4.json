I am almost done with the expansion part of this journey! This has proven to be more painful than I thought. At my last fill I was really in a lot pain afterwards. I had to go for a dress fitting for my sons wedding and I could hardly get out of the car. my poor hubby had to get me undressed and put me into my dress I was in so much pain. My PS left me alone the week of the wedding so I would not be in pain for the wedding. The day of the wedding I felt the best I have in a long time, but Sunday I was really tired and sore. Today at my visit he showed me two types of implants. the \"old\" standard type and a newer natural teardrop looking type. I have to decide which kind I want. guess I will be doing research on these. I also saw the oncologist and he is running the oncotype dx test on my tumor. That will show whether I need chemo or not. I too am getting tired of the \"looks\" and people asking \"how are you doing\" I know they are just concerned but sometimes I just want to go back to the time when I didn't have cancer. I can also relate to the painful car rides. I'm actually better when I'm driving then when I'm in the car as a passenger. Maybe I'm more careful with the turns and bumps. I would love to take my dog for a walk too but I know that will not happen for a while. I'm going to go catch up on some of the threads in here. I've been MIA lately with the wedding and stuff around here",

I also have had some prickly feeling in my upper arm area on that side. everytime I moved my arm it felt like it was rubbing against sandpaper. PS said that since I had some feeling that meant the nerve was probably stretched and I will regain feeling there. beach2beach - I think the reasoning behind not shaving is so you do not nic yourself and cause an infection. with the lymph nodes removed you will have to be careful of that so you do not get lymphodema .",

When I had my double mastectomy and decided on reconstruction I decided that I would go a little bigger in the boob area since now I had the choice on what size I could be. I was always a A and always felt self conscious about it. Well I went through the expansion and the boobs looked a little bigger than I had been so I told the plastic surgeon that I was expanded enough. Right after my expansion I had to get a new plastic surgeon because the one I had left our hospital. At my last expansion the plastic surgeon had to remove some of the fluid since my skin was not looking good. At my transfer from tissue expanders to implants last Thursday the new plastic surgeon asked if I was happy with my size. (before surgery) I told her I was but if she could go bigger I would not have a problem with it. Well surgery is now over and she said she could not get the bigger size to work. so now I am no bigger or maybe even smaller than before I started. I guess the implant size that fit was not as big as the tissue expander size as I am not that big. My emotions are all over the place and I know this is the only place I can post or talk about this. hubby just rolls his eyes at me. I can't stop crying about this and it all seems like it should not be that big a deal to me. I've been a rock during this whole thing and this is what is bringing me to tears!?? maybe it's all just starting to hit home I don't know. At 60 yrs old who needs bigger boobs right!!",

My oncotype test came back with a number that was in the gray area! I figured that would happen, but I guess he felt it was low enough that I did not need chemo. since no lymph nodes were involved Radiation was also ruled out. I am now on the hormone blocker anastrozole for 5 yrs. I am starting that this week as I also had to go on Fosamax because they found out I have osteoporosis. He wanted me on the the fosamax for a few weeks before starting the hormone blocker. Have you ladies heard the news about the fact that they are now saying that ER+ breast cancers risk does not go down after years like they thought? It was on the news the other night that a new study came out about it. They are recommending people stay on the hormone blocker indefinitely! I was not happy to read this and will be talking to my oncologist in January when I see him again. I still have my tissue expanders in waiting for the NEW plastic surgeon to arrive. my original one left. They do not expect her to be here till sometime in December so I'm guess I won't get my exchange until January. I hope everyone is doing well. I have to see my surgeon this week too so I guess I will see what he has to say. I'm worried about my left arm mobility. It's still not where I think it should be.",

I found this board right before I went in for surgery and decided to take a \"break\" from reading cancer stuff. I needed to unplug from cancer for awhile and think about something different for once. If that was even possible. anyway I'm going to go through and read all the posts here to catch up. my diagnosis came from calcium deposits. my biopsy came back ER+ and PR+ with HER2 neg. I had my surgery on Tuesday and came home on Thursday afternoon. I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction done. I was under for 6+ hours. to bring you up to date I had calcium deposits that showed up as cancer in one breast. this was the second time for this breast to have these so the surgeon suggested a mastectomy due to my small breast size and also the fact that this breast has given me issues before. I opted to have the other one off too and do the reconstruction. The dye they injected into me to show the nodes did not work so the surgeon took what he thought was good. it ended up being 2 sentinel, 4 nonsentinel. He called me last night at 10 pm to tell me they all came back clear of cancer. When he first talked to me after surgery I though he had taken a lot more lymph nodes but after reading the path report guess he only got 6. (hope that is enough for an accurate reading) I have my 4 drains in yet...what a pain those are!!! hopefully Monday I will be getting at least some of them out. I'm going to the beauty shop today to have my hair washed. I can't stand myself anymore!! Can't wait to get into a nice shower. I'm tolerating the pain well with only tylenol. I wish everyone the best here and I will try to catch up the best I can. I see the plastic surgeon on Monday to hopefully remove the drains and check the tissue expanders. I still have to meet with an oncologist to figure out what is needed down the road.",

Man this scar is a LOT worse then my mastectomy scar! It is raised and thick. my other scar although a lot bigger looked ten times better at this stage. At least its under by breasts.

I talked to my General Surgeon and his recommendation was a mastectomy on the side with the cancer and then keep the other breast. He feels we caught this early so fingers crossed that no lymph nodes are involved. I have decided to have both breasts taken off. I know my surgeon is going to have a melt down when he hears this but in the end it's really my decision. I saw the plastic surgeon today. I do want to add a little bit to my size since I am really lopsided right now. my left is the bigger of the two and is probably a small B where my right is more like an A. The cancer is in the bigger boob. So I am looking at a mastectomy with reconstruction. This could happen as early as next week. My plastic surgeon is going on vacation and if they can't do it next week I have to wait till the end of the month. I really do not want to do that. My Her2 test came back negative which I think is a good thing. so that is where I stand right now. The surgeons are going to talk and then I will know more.",

I went back in for my 6 month mammo to get me back to my yearly and they found new calcification's. that was in November 2016. They said come back in 6 months and that was in June when they biopsied the area and it was cancer. This is not the same area of my first biopsy it is in a different area. I just turned 60 yrs old last month. I have a Dr appt tomorrow afternoon to discuss this. I have already seen the biopsy path results. some things that were on there are ER+ and PR+.I don't even know where to start for questions to ask. I did look at the questions in here to ask and a lot of them seem to be for after surgerical removal. So far the only questions I have written down are 1. grade 2- between slow and fast growing and prognosis is between good and bad. - is this considered to be aggressive? 2. HER2 - was sent for FISH test as it was 2+. How long before results are in 3. I have 2 grown daughters should they be tested for the gene? 4. my son is getting married in September ( 9 weeks away) - can I wait for treatment or should I do it now? 5- is double mastectomy possible?
