I had a profalactic (sp?) hysterectomy on May 2 and they found that breast cancer had spread to my left ovary. I have been a breast cancer survivor for 2 years and was on tamoxifen. My Onc has me on Aromasin for 5 years. No chemo, no other treatment. She said they caught it early. I am wondering if there is anyone that can tell me about their similar experience? Thanks so much!
