A",

I feel I managed those both quite well but I had already decided to remove my ovaries so that treatment was short lived. I had my ovaries removed 4 months after completing active treatment and started Letrozole at the same time. My hot flashes and achy joints were pretty bad but I stuck it out for about 2 years. My Onc tried to get me to change the AI several times but I resisted until just a month ago (I guess I felt it was a situation of 'better the devil you know'). I changed to Aromisin last month. I am happy to say the achy joints are much better. Not totally gone but much better. I still have hot flashes but they come less frequently now. It's nice to know there are a few options out there so you can always try something different.  ",

I did a lot of research about micropapillary and I agree, some of the earlier info was a bit scary. You will probably notice, though, that there isn\u2019t a ton of newer information and that\u2019s because they have ultimately determined that it\u2019s response to treatment is much like IDC...in some studies even a bit better. The one thing that is true about micropapillary is that it is quick to spread to lymph nodes...as you know. I also had more lymph node involvement than they expected. Sounds like you are set up to receive \u201cthe works\u201d, which although tough is doable. Treat yourself kindly over the coming year and indulge in special treats when you can. Take care",

I was diagnosed on July 10th (6 weeks after a completely normal mammogram) with a 3cm IDC tumor and mets to lymph nodes.  I had a mastectomy 10 days later and final pathology showed a 3.5cm tumor, Grade 2, Stage IIb with 5/8 lymph nodes involved.  I started chemo on Aug 20th and will be having 4 A/C followed by weekly taxol.  I am sure I will be having radiation and tamoxifen on my menu as well.  When I had my scans pre-operatively my bone scan was clear and my CT showed what appeared to be a very small hemangioma on my liver.  The plan was to have an ultrasound of my liver after I had recovered from surgery.  All my doctors forgot and I reminded them last week.  They couldn't find the 'spot' at all despite the tech working very hard.  She consulted the radiologist who felt that the 'spot' was high on my liver and might not be visible with ultrasound...also apparently it was the size of a pencil mark.  Now I am freaking out that it was mets and having already had a treatment it has shrunk or gone. I am feeling really down.  I haven't met anyone with as many lymph nodes involved as me...does anyone have some good stories out there? I have 3 young kids and feeling so sad right now. Thx for reading. A",

At my diagnosis I had a 3cm tumor and 5 lymph nodes and had just had a clear mammogram 3 weeks prior so I have developed a healthy scepticism of radiological reports. The radiologist who read that mammogram admits he just missed it. I will be seeing my Onc on Tuesday morning so hopefully we can pull all of the pieces together and come to a conclusion. I know I will be changing AI as the degenerative changes are worsening. ",

I have had very bad back pain for just over a week (that's what I get for dancing the night away). My Onc ordered a bone scan as I have a history of crazy SI joint stuff. The results came in over the weekend. Seems my SI stuff hasn't changed and is probably the cause of my back pain but there are 2 spots on my ribs. One is on a rib and one is near or at my sternum. The radiologist has reported them as not suspicious looking (or something like that) but my Onc says \"I can't be sure\" so it is off for a PET now. I don't have a very good feeling about this. I am almost exactly 3 years from initial diagnosis. Any prayers or supportive thoughts would be appreciated. The waiting game is the worst. Thanks, Andrea",

I have had two prior bone scans that just showed degenerative changes at my SI joint (the area of pain). Well this time the scan showed 3 spots on my ribs (no pain right now). The report stated \"increased uptake...right 3rd rib in the anterior axillary line, right 5th rib at the costochondral junction and the 11th rib in the posterior axillary line suspicious for early metastatic disease\". It goes on to say \"rib fractures might give the same appearance so further rib X-Ray is recommended if not already done\" All this sent me in for an urgent PET/CT yesterday. The nuclear medicine radiologist assures me that there is no cancer on the PET and that the CT show the ribs as old fractures. I did have a bad cough last Sep that landed me in the emergency room with severe rib pain but the X-ray at that time showed nothing. What do I believe? Ugh! I want to be relieved with these results but still not sure. Would love to hear any thoughts or stories.
