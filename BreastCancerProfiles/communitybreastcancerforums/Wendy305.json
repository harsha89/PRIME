I am a bit more private that way I suppose. I hope this week is as easy as last week! On the upside...I found a short sleeve \u201crash guard\u201d swimsuit that will cover all areas being radiated...I miss being in the pool in summer! Cant wait to swim again!",

So, I had a ALND on 5/10- woke up in a compression wrap and surgical bra that are making me itch so much I could lose my mind! Has anyone removed a compression band to change into a non-elastic banded bra and put the compression wrap back on??? The drains are not nearly as problematic as the itching! I am going to end up with full-blown blisters soon!",
