At this point, it sounds like your mother needs to be put on IVs and parental nutrition - which would be at a hospital. Anti-nausea and antidiarrheal medications to stop the vomiting and diarrhea. Once this is under control and she gains some strength and weight back, then better treatment decisions can be made. You may have to insist on this if you are not being heard by her doctors. Keep calling and even show up in person if you are having trouble being heard by her doctors. It can be quite frustrating as an advocate - but keep shouting until someone hears you and you feel like your mother is being taken care of",

Especially about eating some walnuts :) the first nutritionist I ever saw back when I was in undergrad and starting my nutrition degree and inquiry, I remember clearly told me to eat more walnuts. He really was an advocate of getting or nutrients from whole food sources, so were all my teachers in my integrative nutrition master degree courses. You made a very good point about vitamin E! I am once again stating my gratitude to those who are brave enough to be the guinea pigs to this deworming protocol. I mentioned it to my MO and he and his fellow had not heard any thing about it. They seemed surprised, concerned, and interested that this is happening in the cancer community. I will keep watching \u201cfrom afar\" and waiting to see how it goes for everyone. I think if/when I get to the place of having zero options left medically, I would absolutely give the FenBen a try right this very moment. But I am very lucky that all my treatments are working very well right now. So...fingers crossed for us all to keep doing well! I did study integrative naturopathic oncology and the amount of curcumin that is needed to reach the therapeutic anti-tumor value is something like 250,000mg or something like that (gotta double check my notes here on the exact numbers) and at that level would need to be administered intravenously. My own ND told me not to take curcumin with Ibrance, but we discussed whole food turmeric being okay for the most part. Curcumin is the bioactive compound found in turmeric. Generally speaking, curcumin has wonderfully supportive properties for certain chemotherapies but possibly not all. Doesn't mean that it is right for Ibrance. In the way that eating grapefruit can decrease the liver's CYP450 metabolism of certain medications (hence causing medications to remain in the blood longer, which can cause the medication to exceed its therapeutic value and move into the realm of toxicity in the body - hence we are told NOT to eat grapefruit with Ibrance so that we do not get too much Ibrance toxicity)...curcumin may increase the CYP450 metabolism of Ibrance or other medications, which in turn causes the medication to leave the body too quickly - and we lose the full effectiveness of the medication(s). Long winded explanation of why or why not folks would like to take their chances with different supplements like curcumin. Truly it is best (in my humble opinion) to work with someone who really understands supplementation and pharmacological interactions - if going this route and feeing uncertain. (Steps down off soapbox)... Love and hugs! Philly",

The ones I was specifically speaking of in my original post before was curcumin and the potential interaction it can have with different medications.That is all. I am excited for everyone who is going for it and at the same time, I do feel concern (I think wisely) around the fact that there is ONE man who is using anecdotal evidence for something that could potentially be more harmful than good. PRAISE TO YOU ALL IF IT WORKS AND I PROMISE I WILL JUMP ON THE BANDWAGON! You are the brave pioneers! At the same time, I also wonder about the one woman with stage 4 MBC who did immunotherapy and had a total response. Why was she the ONLY one out of all the people in clinical trial to become cancer free? I can't help but wonder about this same situation with Joe Tippen's being the only one out of his clinical trial who had a complete response. Was it his protocol? Was it that he is an exceptional responder? I don't know the answer. These are the mysteries that we will all continue to try and figure out.

Once I\u2019m there I know I\u2019ll wake up :) I think I may have to embrace a bit of a lifestyle change soon here, dietary-wise. I may have to cut out caffeine and alcohol completely which I feel sadness around. I don\u2019t drink a lot but my stomach is telling me it\u2019s unhappy. I love an occasional glass of red wine or a yummy cocktail. I hope that this too shall pass and I will be able to enjoy these things occasionally again. Hugs to all! Brenda",

I have had a big week of exercise since last Sunday...Zumba, tai fit and abs, cardio kickboxing, yoga, zumba. I am feeling proud of myself. My body is not as happy - been having some low back pain and oddly leg pain...what the heck??? Not sore but like a deep ache! Is this the letrozole or the Xgeva or the Ibrance causing these things? Or all of it? Of course I can get mentally freaked out and think it\u2019s the bone Mets...even though the scans show that they have healed at this point. Anyone else have this happen? I\u2019m getting a massage tomorrow and will ask for extra focus on these areas. Also maybe going to take some Tylenol or something. I don\u2019t know why I fight taking these meds so much sometimes, when they can really bring relief! I was hoping the yoga yesterday would help with the achines of the low back but it didn\u2019t seem to touch it. And then Zumba today I was hoping would get the endorphins flowing and natural pain blockers in my body. It did seem to help some! I don\u2019t mean to complain but I feel like this is a place where folks would understand and be less \u201cworried\u201d than my family if I tell them all the details of each ache and pain. Anyway - hope everyone is doing well! Hugs abound!!! Brenda",

However, after how I\u2019ve been so sore from this last incredibly deep and strong massage - I am wondering if I need either another strong and deep one to keep moving all the stuff along or if I should stick to the gentle (and somewhat annoying for me) oncology massages.

I spent three days in Brooklyn, NY walking around a lot which I am telling myself was a great substitute for my typical 30 minutes of cardio/strength-training daily workout. Now back in Philly and drinking coffee and working my way to do the 30 minute workout and take a long walk to a special pharmacy to pick up some cream to help hopefully with vaginal dryness issues - getting a two for one outta this! A walk AND some meds - Double Bonus!! Hoping the cream works. You all help inspire me to get it together and get exercising. It is truly the one thing that keeps me from feeling the deep Ibrance/Letrazole fatigue and other fun side effects! Hugs to all! Brenda",

I haven\u2019t been out to the clubs in so long. I REALLY love it so much - it is one of my lifelong passions and loves. Dancing heals my heart like nothing else! I had a couple amazing dance partners and one in particular that was the most memorable last night. I felt pretty energetic the whole time and was so thrilled at my salsa stamina and muscle memory of all the fun moves, despite it being so long. I am thankful to all the exercise I do (Zumba, cardio kickboxing and tai fit and abs etc) for my body\u2019s ability to do it! I\u2019ve been going to this club for about 15 years now, and it feels like home to me. I got to see so many friends and dance partners that I haven\u2019t seen in so long. It\u2019s not the most exciting and brightly lit video, but here is me dancing last night with a very gentle lead and handsomely dressed partner last night that my friend took, if anyone is interested. (I have to turn my phone brightness all the way up to see it clearly.) https://youtu.be/RZPbG0kxMZQ I felt like I was my old self again!! Inspired to keep this up! I used to go out 5 nights a week!! I will be happy if I start going out one night a week :-) it is what I am aspiring to do now. Keep on moving my friends!!!

This is the one I did: I love Doyogawithme.com - they have tons of free and fantastic yoga classes for ALL levels and body capabilities. I think I am going to try and incorporate before bed yoga every night so to help me with the pain that wakes me up at night in my arms, neck and shoulders. I don't know if this is from a bad car accident last year or rather because of bone mets? Confused with these symptoms! But the stretching definitely helps :) G'night all :)",

And it seems like the soreness lasts longer...Does anyone else experience this? I am ROOTING for myself to go out salsa dancing tonight with some girlfriends. Of course it is raining and my dad went to the ER this morning with a possible norovirus (he's in his mid 70s and has a lot of GI issues - so the docs don't like to take any chances), so all these things may combust for me to end up staying home and just going to Zumba tomorrow instead.

I have had an incredibly busy schedule between work and visits to the hand specialist and PT therapy. I am not one percent positive, but ever since starting the meds (and I am thinking it's the letrozole) I have had some pretty bad neck, shoulder, and arm pain and both arms will fall asleep at night. The physiatrist I initially saw (who recommended the PT and hand specialist) gave me like 4 different diagnoses which in my mind reads = they have no freaking clue what is wrong with you. The PT exercises seem to be calming down the neck and shoulder pain a bit but not so sure it's really doing too much. Arms still falling asleep at night. My right thumb has an extremely thickened base joint and my thumb gets stuck in the trigger finger position. The hand specialist has me doing special thumb muscle stretching exercises - it's kinda cute, because it's such a small level stretching, and it does bring my thumb into a less tense state. But the joint being so thick is making me a bit concerned. I am also a bodyworker and have been doing massage for the past 12 years, so probably a combo of an occupational hazard plus the aromatase inhibitors reeking havoc. This is all new since I started the meds so it is difficult for me to not put two and two together here. The hand specialist has taped my thumb and it does feel good but it is a difficult are to stay on especially with the work I do, so it basically comes off about one hour after she puts it on. I have been starting to having painful sensations at the balls of my feet. Especially after sitting or laying down for about 15 minutes and then getting up and walking around. It causes me to hobble for a few minutes until the feet warm up. Does anyone else have this? Is this neuropathy?? This started about 3-4 months ago and at first was only on left foot and now the right foot too :( I am hoping to get to exercise this weekend - I'm setting aside time tomorrow and Sunday to hit the gym! Gotta keep moving!! Love, Philly (PS pic of my thumb in its trigger finger position for those interested!) ",

Sending you lots of positive healing thoughts that your back gets better ASAP and you don't have to be on the pain meds for long - I don't like them either. They make me very wonky and woozy. But if they give you relief and help with the pain and help you to be able to get the rest you need, then sometimes a good thing. Bec - welcome!! Sorry you are here but happy to have you join us!

Today at 5:30pm I am going to try a kickboxing class that I haven't been to yet - different instructor. My current instructor just had serious oral Surgery yesterday and I feel annoyed with him that he's being \"macho\" and insisting on teaching class today while on a bunch of pain meds and in my mind, should be home resting and recovering. So I'm going on a personal strike from his class today üò¨ to show that I don't support this style of self-care....I'm nuts, I know!!!

Hard to tell what it is from what medication-wise, but I did get a couple bouts of weird itchy bumps the first few months. 2 were giant welts on my arm that lasted a couple weeks and then I had a couple weird breakouts on my chest. My MO team didn\u2019t seem to think anything of it and really had no explanation. It was unusual for me. Other than that, I can\u2019t really tell if I have side effects from it or from the other drugs or just from this diagnosis?. I got a good report at the dentist. My side effects are fatigue, joint pain, and my shoulders hurt a lot at night when I\u2019m sleeping - can\u2019t quite figure out why this is, but something positional",

Went to VT to see the beautiful fall foliage and had some great (but short due to my travel buddy having a cold) hikes. Now back to my Philly routine of Zumba and cardio kickboxing and yoga.

I don't want to bring on any more anxiety - but the reason your post caught my eye was because I did go through a similar experience. I had a diagnosed fibroadenoma in my right breast in 2011. It did grow and would seem to grow bigger with my menstrual cycles. Then it seems to calm down. It was very palpable. I was incredibly nervous had an US and mammogram which confirmed the benign fibroadenoma. Cut to 2017 and my breast started to feel strange and the lump seemed to have tripled in size. My nipple started to retract and my skin became red and inflamed on my breast over the same area. Also a lymph node swelled in my armpit. Went to get checked out - very scary - and then boom: stage 4 de novo. I was always worried about the fibroadenoma and there's a part of me that wishes I could tell my younger self to have had the lump biopsied back in 2011. I was just so happy to hear it was benign at the time that I took that diagnosis and ran with it. On the other hand, I was in the middle of grad school and if I had received a BC diagnosis then, I don't know what would have happened. Instead, I finished my graduate studies and started a business in 2015. Now there's a new wrench in things but I am managing pretty well so far. The mysteries are: 1) would I have still gotten to stage 4 if the lump was biopsied and treated back in 2011? 2) maybe the fibroadenoma was a fibroadenoma and the cancer was something else completely and grew behind the fibroadenoma. Or maybe the fibroadenoma was misdiagnosed and should have been biopsied back in 2011? Anyway - my point is, maybe getting a biopsy on the irregular lump wouldn't be a terrible idea? Just for peace of mind? I'm so glad you have support from your sisters!! I am sending prayers your way too love",

It is scary to see one\u2019s own lab work showing disconcerting results My understanding of alkaline phosphatase is that it is a measurement of liver enzyme activity (there are also ALT and ASP) is one of the ways that we can see what is happening with the health of our livers. Higher alkaline phosphatase could indicate an issue with the liver or it can be indicative of bone diseases (from my understanding- related to an increase in bone production rather than a decrease). It will be good to have further medical investigation to get this assessed.

So this makes it very comfortable for me. I ALWAYS organize my pills/meds/supplements into daily regimens using these little teeny plastic ziplock pill bags that they sell at pharmacy stores. I label them by the day and bring a couple extra days with me just in case of flight delays or any issues. I also bring a bottle of full spectrum antibiotics (thanks to my MO) in case any infections occur. I buy travelers insurance through the airlines (offered at check out) and so far haven\u2019t had to use it - but it is nice to know it\u2019s there just in case. For me, traveling is a MUST. I go between appointments (monthly MO appointments) and sometimes we can extend the appointment by a week if necessary and don\u2019t feel stressed out about it. If I don\u2019t travel I start to feel depressed and anxious. I need to be by the sea, or in forests or on mountains to feel inner calm. And I live right smack in the middle of a huge city - and I would lose my mind if I didn\u2019t get breaks from it. Here are a couple pics from the beach yesterday - I am in my happy place!!!! Love, Philly   ",

I have had no problem traveling except for my own anxiety about the \u201cwhat ifs\" that may happen when traveling. I have to take a deep breath and trust that if something \u201chappens\" to me while I am gone, that I'll be able to get back to the USA in time for me to make it my hospital. So far, nothing like this has happened. All trips have been just wonderful for me. The only downfall to Jamaica was that on the flight home I was stuck next to an elderly woman who was coughing and sneezing like crazy. I tried wrapping my nose and mouth in my scarf but I did end up coming down with a little tiny headcold a couple days later. Next time I may bring a face mask on the planes with me just in case!! I really don't want to wear those awful things but I would have been very happy to have had one this time around. Rosie - sorry you have joined us :( I was diagnosed de novo as well. I was diagnosed in April 2017 and went to Trinidad and Tobago for 2 weeks in May of 2017. I had an amazing time and the trip helped me feel like myself again after such a shocking diagnosis. I have been traveling quite a bit ever since my diagnosis and have zero regrets! Lots of great advice on this thread if you read the prior comments people have written. Sending you a hug - we are here to support you and help answer any questions you may have! We are all on the cruise together that no one bought a ticket for :-/ at least you\u2019ll get to go on one that you had planned and are looking forward to! I say: Listen to your MO! Enjoy your cruise!!!",

As far as I understand, Lexapro is known to be a bit \u201cuplifting\u201d or energizing for folks so it is recommended to take in the morning, since it can induce insomnia for some people. I take Lexapro in the a.m. and then the melatonin in the p.m. before bed. I do know that if I mix melatonin with an anti anxiety medication like Valium, then I get really drugged.

I found this interesting article about serotonin and melatonin: https://atlasofscience.org/melatonin-and-serotonin-in-psychiatric-and-brain-disorders/ Looks like melatonin also has protective properties again brain cancers as well. I have been taking it not for sleep but actually prescribed to me as a good anti-estrogenic breast cancer supplement. It helps me pass out but I still wake up quite a bit in the night. I love the idea that I simply may just need the sleep right now to help fight off the boogeyman. It feels like it allows me to take pressure off myself and guilt off myself about my need for sleep at this time. I am choosing to roll with the belief that my body clearly needs the sleep right now and that once it has finished (maybe it will take a whole year!) then I will stop sleeping so much.",

I was on Obamacare through the Marketplace when I was diagnosed in 2017. My insurance was $300/month payment with a $7500 deductible. You can imagine what a financial mess that was for me all of 2017 (I am not rich with money I am rich with love!) Anywho - in the beginning of 2018, I had to decide which Obamacare/marketplace insurance I was going to get. I really couldn\u2019t make sense of any of it - it\u2019s meant to confuse the heck out of us, sadly. The hospital where I see my MO has a social workers/financial support office and team of individuals. They told me about a Medicaid program for women with breast cancer who make under a certain amount (I think it\u2019s $45K/year?? But don\u2019t quote me!) for which I qualify. The insurance is called Keystone First and so far it has covered everything and I have not had any copays except for $1 when I got my wisdom tooth extracted at an oral surgeons office. I wonder if this is sort of close towhat you are looking for?",

That and also now the experience of realizing that sometimes scan results are incorrect so Not to get too worked up about any one thing until all that info is gathered up by my MO and then discussed with his Onco board of docs and then brought back to me. Hard not to freak out during this time... Another thing that helps me is that (and I don\u2019t know if this is accurate but it feels this way in my brain) I try to remember that nothing bananas is going to happen overnight. This is a slow process and needs lots of angles covered - because cancer is so very multifaceted. There will be some breathing room for making choices and decisions if necessary. Big hugs abound!!!",

Wow!!!) and I take my letrozole first thing when I wake up and then I take my Ibrance with breakfast about an hour or two later. At first I felt all types of things like nausea, heartburn, anxiety...but now I don't have any stomach issues. I wonder if it was all in my head??? I get an occasional upset belly like 1/2 through the cycle or sometimes towards day 21 but nothing too intense. Key things: avoid grapefruit and I was told by my ND also pomegranate, curcumin, goldenseal and I researched that bergamot (key ingredient in earl Grey tea) should be avoided as bergamot is the essential volatile oil from a certain kind of orange that is a no-no. All the best! Brend ",

I don\u2019t know why you would be having estrogen-like symptoms but perhaps since you aren\u2019t currently on any type of estrogen suppression (I hope I\u2019m understanding correctly) that you are having an estrogen/hormonal flare? Our bodies are not totally rid of estrogen after menopause. We still make some amount of estrogen in our adrenal glands and fatty tissues. Maybe make a call to your MOs office tomorrow? I think that we really have to be proactive in our care. Our bodies are our indicators. If something seems odd, then let the MOs know so they can evaluate and decide if something needs tweaking. Keeping you in my thoughts",

One of my Onco docs said, \u201cwell you wouldn\u2019t go around telling everyone you have diabetes, so why go around telling people you have MBC?\u201d It was helpful and continues to be helpful to hear. But on the other hand, yes some days are harder. I have my own private medical practice and so I dont share my info with my patients. But I\u2019ve been incredibly open with most people in my circle since day one. For the most part, everyone just continues to tell me how amazingly well I am doing and look! It is a wacky dichotomy!!! I am VERY glad that people around me know - so I can pull the C card whenever necessary without guilt or anyone getting upset. It\u2019s fantaetic!! I also get told sometimes by loved ones how exhausted I look - which doesn\u2019t always feel amazing to hear üòÇ it\u2019s not a compliment! I think they say it outta concern rather than anything else. I\u2019m about to go on a Tinder date in a couple hours (Im 41 and single here). The big question is, at what point in dating someone do I share this news. That\u2019s a tough one!!! Wish me luck!!!",

(And I did not disclose my medical info!)  xbrnxgrl yes! I still feel soooo isolated in that I know only two people in the whole Philly area with the same diagnosis! One I stalked for a little while but she wasn't into it and the other was a lovely woman my age who we had lunch one time but since have lost touch - I've tried to get together with her but I just don't think that she feels it is important to have close contact as much as I would have liked. And I'm not gonna push it because it's not my nature too. I found both those women through Facebook and otherwise I haven't connected with anyone physically (in real life) to get together and just shoot the breeze about it all. I'm a huge believer in supporting one another. If I can be there for someone else who is going through the hellish nightmare of a cancer diagnosis and offer some light at the end of the tunnel, that would be an amazing honor!!",

I think we all understand that cancer is not a \"one size fits all.\" and there are so many factors that lead into one person's remission or stabilization from another. Some people are extraordinary responders and some people are outliers. I wish there was a perfect answer to how to cure ourselves of cancer, especially Stage 4. If there is one, I think the world would be jumping up and down for joy. Unfortunately, there are many people that think they have the right answer for how to \"cure\" cancer and then they use this as a marketing scheme to monetize their own agenda. I keep seeing it time and time again. And it sadly gives so many people false hope, causes unnecessary spending and misleading promises. It is possible that this woman's protocol may offer people one or two more months alive? I honestly have no idea. But for me, I do no want to spend my time stressing out about if I am taking all the right supplements at all the right times just to add on a couple extra months. I want to live and be happy and as stress-free as possible. Just one gals take on it all. These folks, including the Chris Beats Cancer guy, just plain outright annoy the heck outta me!! Hugs to you and hope you are doing/feeling as well as can be! Philly",

I know it's easy to do, but there could be many reasons for the fever and pain. I had a tooth extracted and i did have a lot of pain afterwards which is normal - there is an injury to the jaw bone when a tooth is extracted and it can take several weeks to heal and feel normal again. The fever may be due to something else entirely. It is good that you are taking your mom to see her MO and they will give a sound recommendation hopefully. I can tell you that the first year I started treatments I seemed to have a lot of \u201cflares\" that included random fevers for several days. I now believe that they were healing responses to the medicine. Good luck - sending your mom and you lots of positive thoughts! Brenda",

The docs are doing what they've been taught to try and keep us chugging along with the best QOL as possible (or at least that is the hope, right?). I think I worry more about the possibility of pain ans discomfort down the line. And we just don't know if we will be okay for 10 more years or just one year. So there's some pressure to make each day awesome somehow. I just try to relax.",
