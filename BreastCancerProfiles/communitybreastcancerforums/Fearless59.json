I am new here and I am also playing the waiting game right now, after a biopsy today. I totally understand the upset of not knowing. I was given a BIRADS 5, probable spiculated masses, irregular, 4.5 cm with satellites spanning out 10 cm. and extra blood circulation indicative of cancer (trying to leach more nutrients for itself, from what I understand) After a routine mammo then a diagnostic zoom mammo and US. I hope you get good news from the biopsy! I am trying to just stay busy doing pro-survival things that make me happy, while I wait. But, I was encouraged to see most of my biopsy samples FLOATING in the little jar of preservative. I wanted to know as much as possible and asked to see the little buggers. The doctor said that cancer typically does not float. Also, she found no lymph node involvement. Whoopee!! I had only 2 sinkers out of 10 or 12 tissue samples and one of them was not all the way at the bottom and acted like it was trying to be a floater. Doc did not seem to be worried but may just be conservative and act relaxed for all patients so as not to alarm any of us unnecessarily. Thats pretty cool. I do not mind waiting. No decisions need to be made yet and I like that!! Let us just use the extra time in good ways and stay as busy as we can doing fun things. Lets hope we both get good news. ok? Hugs, Marg ",

I had the pain ball (nurse called it a comfort ball) and it was awesome. I had left mastectomy on 1/12. The ball shrinks over time, has a tiny pump sending a lydocaine type of local pain killer in slowly. I had Percosets all ready to go after surgery but never needed any of them because for some reason my pain ball lasted over 8 days when they said 4 days. I think I had ice on myself a few times the first 4 days, freezing the hose maybe? But it was awesome. I did not have any reconstruction things, and I have great pain tolerance so I may not be typical, but surgery was pretty easy for me, just fall asleep and wake up with no boob and a giant scar. I will write again with post-surgery thoughts hoping it will help. Love, Fearless ",

And be at your beck and call another 3 days at least, though they can pop out for errands. First 24 hours not being left alone was a hospital policy. I am tough but I was a total wuss and did not even cook for 4-5 days. 3) Ice and water in a ziplock bag. Someone there to fetch it on demand cause you do not wish to move much in the first 4 days. 4) A hot water bottle or rice bag that you microwave. I felt cold and wanted it on my belly and hands, but wanted ice bag on boob site. 5) Tons of pillows. I understand some reconstructions require that you sleep in a certain position for weeks? Not on your side or the new boobs will be adversely affected. I read this in plastic surgeon options for reconstruction. 6) A clean house and full frigerator for recovery. If you have time, disinfect stuff before surgery cause you want no infection chance. 7) Pain killer prescription filled ahead of time just in case. 8) Low energy entertainment....books, dvd movies, remote controlled! Thought I would knit or embroider but NO WAY! Not enough energy. It is couch potato time. 9) Peace and quiet. 10) A cell phone, and turn it off when resting. You will want to pick and choose when to talk and text. 11) I would caution you against driving for at least a week or two after surgery if possible. Even 2 weeks out, I was spacy and missing turns and \"not all there,\" and my surgery was only 3 hours, and no pain killers by mouth at all. So please be safe and get someone else to drive a while if you have that luxury. It could save your life. Love, Fearless",

I am about 40 lbs overweight and weighing my treatment options for best long term survival. Thanks.",

When I was still hurting, b4 I got my prosthesis, I wore a sports bra that had a little padding, over a tight t-shirt, took a quart ziplock, filled it with ice and a little water, and stuffed it in the empty breast cup. The ice melted faster than I expected but shape looked about right and the cold felt great! A little wad of paper towels was all right, too. Of course, a lightweight jacket over that in public. Hope you feel better now. I pulled out my own drain in the shower. Haha. Really glad to ditch that thing. Fearless",

Also, they do not make recons big enough to match a DDD so would have had to slice and dice the other side to match reconstructed side. Not a happy thought. And, what would happen if I lost weight? Would probably be uneven. So, with one natural, I can get any size prosthesis as needed. By the way, the Amoena I wear was free at our local American Cancer Society office. Those are $300 each at Nordstroms. And, if my size changes, I can go back to ACS and trade for larger or smaller. Awesome!!",

I am glad to hear that all of the diagnostics moved along so promptly, and everything is in place for getting you taken care of right away. What a wise idea to move your wedding date up! Of course it is all pretty new and scary, uncharted territory! My time frames are pretty close to yours, so I understand. My mammo was 10/28 and the red flags and follow ups caused me to miss my December vacation. I am still waiting on a surgery date to be set but my insurance will be better in January. I am glad you found this site and will do my best to support you! You can do this!!! Fearless59",
