Sounds like your experiencing enough vacations and enough misplaced manosite.  Enough this and enough that.  Frankly  I don't know squat.  I'm just a husband who wife is in a similar situation.  I do believe that it is important to do exactly what you're doing and that is get some confirmation as to what in the heck you are going through. We decide to go with the 5 day treatment rather than the 5 or 6 weeks of radiation also.  We have no doubts about that choice.  My wife has two more days and frankly she is ready to call the doc and tell him she has had enough. It is not only scary but it goes against all conventional wisdom.  Thanks for letting me sound off.  Good Luck with everything.    j   Rather than the balloon my wife has 14 catheters inplanted that the radiation seeds are sent through.  She have been very comfortable with the procedure but has gotten really sick with the radiaton.  Most woman don't.  We are all very unique. God bless.",
