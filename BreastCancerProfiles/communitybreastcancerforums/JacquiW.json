I would be happy with that plan outcome. I'm so happy for you :) That's wonderful that they took so much time to look after you and explain everything. It would really instil confidence that they explained why you can have a lump that isn't a lump (haha) and that they're going to follow it up in a few months. Did they say the tissue in the area of interest is more prominent / dense than the rest? Thank you so much for letting me know how you went at your appointment. I would love to hear how your 3 month check up goes as well. It's certainly good to know that a lump can indeed just be dense tissue! Mine is kind of over the ribs as well I guess, so fingers crossed that I get a similar outcome! Wouldn't explain the pain though... Looks like I'm getting my MRI next week, as my cycle began a week earlier than expected. Thank you, body! Haha. This site has been an absolute blessing! I am completely in control of my emotions now. I'll admit it's still always in the back of my mind, but I'm not obsessing or stressing anymore :) Phew! All the best xx",

It's scary isn't it that you can having imaging that shows nothing, and then shortly after have imaging that shows 2 masses! It's because of stories like that, that I have opted to get an MRI. Good luck with your lumpectomy, when are you booked for your procedure? Hope it all goes well and the masses are confirmed as benign :) NewburyBerry, it sounds like you and I are in a very similar situation! Have you booked in for an MRI? I'm going in for mine this Friday, and I will most likely follow this up with an appointment with a breast surgeon regardless of the results. Please keep us updated on your journey :) All my wishes that you get some benign answers :) Lisa, good to hear from you! How is your recovery coming along? It must be good getting back to \"normal\" life, though I imagine it would feel anything but normal! Will you be undergoing further treatment? Thank you very much for keeping me in your thoughts :) Only 2 more days til they stick me in the tube! (I have claustrophobia and have been prescribed valium so that I don't hyperventilate haha) I will definitely keep you updated on my progress. I'm heading to the snow for 3 days after the MRI which will keep my mind of waiting for the results, yay! Much love and best wishes to all of you xxx",

How did your appointment go on Friday? I hope all your questions were answered :) I hated the MRI so much! I forgot about your suggestion to turn my head, and actually ended up with bruises on my chin! I am a big sooky weakling though =p I rang my health centre today and the MRI results are in. The receptionist checked with the doctor and told me \u201cthey\u2019re all good\u201d. So I guess that means nothing suspicious was found :) Now I just have to wait for my appointment next Thursday to find out if they found anything at all to explain the lump and the pain. If nothing showed in the MRI I'm not sure what to do next - whether to just accept it as \"one of those things\", or to continue to seek answers (ie see a breast surgeon)... I guess I'll just have to wait and see what my Dr has to say next Thursday. Snow was awesome! Bruised my tailbone and hurt my wrist, but totally worth the fun, plus I didn't think about my breast the whole time I was away! xo",

I thought it was only the lobular type that did this. Do you have dense breast tissue that hid yours?  I'm glad I did a bit of research in order to know to ask for the MRI. If nothing shows up on that I think I will see a BS and ask for a biopsy. I don't want to stop looking until they can find an explanation... It's so hard not to stress, it's all I can think about! Can't concentrate at work... Any tips for not letting worry consume you? I know the odds are in my favor and it's probably fine, but I just can't shake it! ",

I didn't get any sleep last night but waking up to your lovely posts has got me feeling much better today :) I've got this ;) Lichenandseeds, I'm sorry that you are going through this as well. Will you be seeing a breast surgeon at the breast clinic? I'm wondering if I should have just asked to be referred to a BS rather than getting the MRI... I have a terrible feeling that my mass is something of concern, but I'm sure everyone gets that feeling! For some reason your explanation of how you're dealing with your stress is the first that has got through for me. I like the wording you used, that you've resigned yourself to the fact this may take a while. I'm going to out in a big effort to just sit back and let what happens, happen :) hopefully I will be successful! I think the fact that no one wants to talk to me about it (they say at this point there's nothing to talk about...) was making me bottle it all up. Thank goodness I found this place to vent my fears! Lisa, thank you so much for sharing your experience with me, I really do appreciate it. I'm sorry that you have had to go through what you have, and I hope that things are looking up for you. Thank goodness you pushed for your MRI, I certainly hope that mine gives me some answers (hopefully benign!) I feel that yesterday I managed to get things off my chest thanks to this site, and now hopefully I will be much more successful with pushing these thoughts from my mind. Thank you so much for your good thoughts and prayers it's wonderful to know I have those coming my way :) maybe they are what has me feeling better today!  Strangely I'm not scared, haven't been scared at any point really, I am ok with the idea that I may possibly be diagnosed with cancer, and am ready to take on whatever comes at me. It just stresses me out when  I don't know which way things are going to go. I just want to be able to move forward one way or another! All the best to you both, please keep in touch! Jacqui xx",

      "Content": "JacquiW wrote: Hi everyone, I'm a new member and fingers crossed only a temporary member :) I'm 27. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience to me, and how things worked out for them. I'm not very good at keeping my stories short, so I apologise for the lengthy post...! About a year ago I suddenly had pretty bad pain at 9oclock on my left breast. The doctor did a manual examination and sent me for an ultrasound, but nothing was found and she sent me on my way. The pain lessened after a few weeks but never went away, and has been a constant dull pain for a year now, greatly exacerbated by pressure.  I finally decided to see another doctor as I figured it didn't seem normal to me that the pain would last so long. This doctor examined me and quickly found a lump in the questionable area and a swollen lymph node. She sent me for another ultrasound and mammogram. Nothing was seen in the ultrasound or mammogram, other than particularly dense tissue in the area of the pain and lump. To be honest, this was when I started to feel concerned. I had hoped they would find a cyst or something else benign that would explain the pain and the lump. I went back to my doctor and expressed my concern, at which point she admitted to me that when she felt my lump she was concerned that it was breast cancer, and hence was very happy to refer me for the MRI that I requested. (She also assured me that there's no way to diagnose a lump by how it feels and that the neg US and mammo is reassuring). Due to the necessity of having the MRI between the 6th and 16th day of your cycle, I have to wait a month before I can have it done. So... Has anyone had a similar experience to mine, and how did it turn out for you? I'm not necessarily looking for reassurance, nor am I trying to self diagnose I'm simply curious to hear about other people's experiences and outcomes. Thank you all so much in advance, what a lovely community that I've been lucky enough to stumble upon xx Log in to post a reply",
