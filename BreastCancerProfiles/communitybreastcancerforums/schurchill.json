      "Content": "schurchill wrote: About 6 months ago I began having spontaneous bloody nipple discharge from my right breast (one duct). The discharge also was bloody when expressed. My doctor ordered an U/S first (I am 32) and when that didn't show anything he ordered a mammogram (also negative). The discharge persisted so he ordered a ductogram. This test also showed nothing. The doctor who preformed the ductogram referred me to a breast surgeon because he said that there was obviously something causing the bloody discharge, but it wasn't something he could see. He said that he thinks the surgeon will preform a ductal excision to remove the entire duct and test it. What are the chances that they will find something after 3 negative tests? Should I ask for an MRI first? Thank you for your input. Log in to post a reply",
