The first was at a general radiology clinic and the latter at a breast oncology center. Biopsy is tomorrow. I'm praying the oncology center is just being extra cautious since they were a 2nd opinion. The stress of waiting has taken a huge toll on me. I have GAD and it's been extremely difficult on me.",

It is hard not to think and search and read worst-case scenarios...but my mind definitely goes there. My husband has been trying to keep me occupied during any downtime so I stay off the computer! NotveryBrave: I have read that as well and I'm hoping I'm closer to the 10%...50% sounds scary, but I keep telling myself that the flip side is that I have a 50% chance of being all clear too! Still...I wouldn't mind better odds! Shellsatthebeach: I think the thing that frustrates me most is that I was never told there was a mass and it was never in the reports. That is my biggest struggle mentally, that I could have possibly investigated this further 6yrs ago instead of sitting around letting it brew. I cannot change the past but I really wish I could! I really pray it's something benign for that reason....6 years is a long time and it makes me ill to think about it. dtad: The MRI that you spoke of...is that something they can do at a yearly screening along with the Mammogram? The clinic I'm going to now is a satellite clinic of one of the large teaching hospitals in the area. The person I am seeing came highly recommended by several friends as well as my doctor so I'm really comfortable with the entire practice. I just wish I knew about them first! I asked if they also do regular screenings there, as they are listed as a breast oncology practice, and they do. The nurse told me most women shy away from getting them done there because they also are a cancer center and that scares them. michelle in comland: I started going at 38 because of the breast density. My doctor wanted a baseline because it was hard to determine what was normal density and what lumps were of concern. After that initial mammogram I got a call back for more images because they had nothing to compare it to. They said it was all clear and normal and sent me on my way. I am now finding out that this mass was there on those images. Now that I look back I wonder if I was just stupid to accept their assessment and maybe I should have gotten a 2nd opinion then...I keep kicking myself for that! I've been going to the same place all these years, however 6 different radiologists have looked at my films in that time and none of them felt it was suspicious enough to warrant a biopsy. I keep clinging to that as a positive sign, however they are \"general\" in that the center does all kinds of imaging studies so they do not solely focus on breast studies. The radiologist I am seeing now ONLY does breast studies at the oncology center and he is concerned, which then makes me nervous! This is such a roller coaster! Hopefull2: We are considering reporting the center to whatever medical boards they report to...something I have to look into. My current doc told me in so many words that she has already started the ball rolling on that. It kills me that when you break your leg, they show you the films and where they see a problem, but when you go for a mammogram (at least at my last place) it's like visiting Oz....he's behind door #1 and never comes out to speak to the patient. My OB tends to follow radiologist reports as written, because she feels that they are the experts in reading those images. She goes over them with me and she has said they have never given her reason to recommend a follow-up. Thankfully she will no longer be recommending her patients to this radiology center, so at least something positive has come from it. The only blessing here is that I am pretty busy this week and next. My Dad has follow-up scans to make sure his Kidney cancer has not returned (he only has a partial kidney left but he's been cancer free for a year!), my oldest son is going away to school so we are busy packing him up, and I start back to school (5th grade teacher) this coming week..l'll have a lot of distraction and not a lot of downtime to think!",

Dropped my oldest off at college today and still waitng for my dad's cancer screening results which has me on edge. I am going to work before I head in for the biopsy. Is it reasonable to think I could go back to work afterwards? I just cannot be alone with my thoughts too long without having a panic attack.",

      "Content": "Hafdozen wrote: Hi all, this is my first post here though I've been reading these boards over the last few weeks. I am so angry, frustrated and completely scared to death right now! I have been going for pretty regular mammograms at the same place since 2011 (I'm 43 now). Shortly before my last mammo I did a BSE and noticed a lump in my left breast just under the nipple, about the size of a grape. I called my OB and she changed the mammo from a screening to a diagnostic with u/s. The lump turned out to be a simple cyst, which I was relieved to find, however they wanted to do additional images and u/s on the right for a mass that they had flagged and been watching (this was actually news to me). After the mammo and u/s of that side they told me that while there was a mass there, it had shrunk from the last mammo and to come back in 6 months to check on it again...which was good news. Something just didn't sit right with me though...I had ZERO knowledge of a mass on the right side that they had been watching...so I requested all historical records from them and picked them up two days later. There is NO mention of a mass on the right side in any of the historical reports. It IS mentioned on the diagnostic they just did and was reported as isoechoic mass measuring 1.6cm with partially marginated borders and has \"slowly increased in size\" since the last mammo. Bi Rads: 3 I called my OB and she referred me to a breast oncologist. I had my appointment with them and they did their own 3D mammo. When I told them about the other radiologist, they called to confer with them and point blank ask them WHY they told me it shrunk and WHY they sent me on my way. The original radiologist said that it has been there since 2011 and has benign characteristics with no significant changes and they stood behind their assessment. They did not send my full records however, and when pressed they finally sent them. The radiologist then took a look at the historical records and said it has been growing since 2011!! I included his report below. I'm just FLOORED that the other radiology dept. would just sweep this under the rug. I am also really concerned that two different radiologists have VERY different opinions of this mass. Of course I'm a complete mess! I cannot eat or sleep...I cannot stop studying my images...I cannot stop thinking about it! My biopsy is scheduled for 8/21 which seems so far away...and then waiting on results. I feel completely defeated already and my gut tells me the results will not be in my favor....there is a reason why I questioned all of this and it wasn't because I felt like everything was hunky dory!. I really want to beg for them to just do the excisional biopsy and lymph nodes and get a step ahead instead of then waiting AGAIN for that. Ugggh! Amendment: Additional prior outside exams of December 31, 2012 and December 29, 2011 have been obtained. Best demonstrated on the right cc projection, a previously described abnormality has progressively increased over that time period. Biopsy continues to be recommended as previously reported. Amended BI-RADS: 4b Suspicious abnormality - intermediate suspicion of malignancy Below is the original report from the oncology radiologist before he saw the 2011 and 2012 images: Comparison is made to exams dated: 7/21/2017 mammogram, 6/29/2016 mammogram, and 1/4/2014 mammogram - **** Radiology. The tissue of the right breast is heterogeneously dense. Current study was also evaluated with a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system. Tomosynthesis images were obtained as part of this exam. There is a 2 cm mass in the right breast at 12 o'clock posterior depth. This is increased in size. No other suspicious masses or calcifications are seen in the breast. SUSPICIOUS OF MALIGNANCY Based on prior outside studies of 7/21/2017, 6/29/2016, 1/4/2014, there is an enlarging mass in the upper outer posterior breast. An outside ultrasound of July 21, 2017 demonstrates a partially circumscribed hypoechoic mass at 10:00, which may correspond to the mammographic abnormality. Both the ultrasound finding and mammographic finding are of concern. Recommendation for ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass demonstrated by ultrasound with placement of a postbiopsy clip and postbiopsy imaging. If the ultrasound detected lesion does not correspond to the mammographic lesion, stereotactic biopsy of the mammographic lesion would then be indicated. Imaging and recommendations reviewed with ******** The 2 cm mass in the right breast at 12 o'clock posterior depth appears to have an intermediate suspicion for malignancy. The patient has been or will be contacted. Log in to post a reply",
