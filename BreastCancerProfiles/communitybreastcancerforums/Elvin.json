The skin copes better if it's dry she said. I always read the opposite... Had a CT and was told that my lung capacities are good so I can start tamoxifen and continue with it during radiotherapy. I went to my gynecologist and she agreed I can start as well. I'm actually very scared of tamoxifen but since the tumor was 100% ER+ nobody even asked me if I want it. The strange thing was that my gynecologist told me she is not afraid of my BC but concerned about my ovaries. Not because of relapse risk, because I could get ovarian cancer and it is hard to cache early. She told me that I'm young with 36 years old onset and she would recommend a oophorectomy when I'm 42-43. She even told me I might be BRCA positive. My MO didn't talk about these things. Now I'm more scared than before............ Actually I'm not looking forward the radiotherapy since I'm so sick and tired to go to the hospital. I was very depressed during the weekly taxol days and cried so much even on the way to the hospital. Don't know if I can cope with this anymore.",
