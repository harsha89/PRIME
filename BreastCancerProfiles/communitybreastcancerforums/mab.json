I have a full-time job, but I could easily spend a 1/4 of a day on the phone with the cancer center billing and the medical insurance billing. And in order to get insurance to pay for the measly 2 sleeves and gloves a year, I have to go out to practically the middle of nowhere (I don't have a car) and then the gloves they give me cut off circulation in my thumb and they tell me to just come back in and they'll re-measure, then they STILL don't fit and I have now had to take two 1/2 days off work for nothing. I understand your frustration. Sometimes dealing with Lymphedema feels like the \"last straw\" and I get so tired with the constant work it involves. I just try to remind myself that I'm still around to complain about it and that sometimes helps. I am glad we have this forum to vent - it really helps!!",

It's funny how falls work - what hurts the most at first, ends up not being the thing that causes you the most grief later on. Thanks again. - mab.",

I also put on a higher compression gauntlet to keep the swelling in check. Any advice from someone who has done this? btw, instinct kicked in and I did a great job of falling on the non LE side! I'll have a black eye tomorrow, too, I think, but I'll just tell people at work that I got in a fight with a Packer fan!
