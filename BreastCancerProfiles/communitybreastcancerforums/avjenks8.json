MRI, CT, PET CT, Mammo,US, Breast biopsy all done. Just waiting for breast biop results to come back on monday. I have taken this news very hard and pretty much saw my poor children loosing their mother.  But with a lot of questions on my part and a great supportive team I am learning that the diag of stage IV BC with mets is NOT a death sentence. So I have done my grieving and now I am angry and determined to not let this DX define me or my life.  Any Stage IV with mets to spine ladies out there can give me advice on anything from diet changes to whatever tips you have. I will say my biggest fight is to not ask \"how long do I have\". Amy L. Jenks--Courage is NOT the absence of fear, Courage is actually forward motion in the presence of fear!

If I understand my path report I have IDC, Stage IV,  high grade 2. I dont know the receptors yet will find out friday when I see the Oncologist.  Been speaking to the females in my extended family as we have noone that we knew of with a history of Breast Cancer.  Well, Just found out that my great grandmother (maternal) died of Breast cancer.  I never knew!!!  So I am just holding my head high and going to fight this with everything I have.",

I was dx on 11/17/11 With Stage IV BC from the start, Mets to bones and nodes. Grade 2 high, My path report reads like stero instructions and confuses me in understanding if I have IDC or DCIS as it mentions both. I am ER/PR+, HER2 pend (should have results 11/28). I have started Lupron to shut down my ovaries and then go end of this week for my port and then start Chemo once we know what the HER2 is.  The waiting on the HER2 scares the crap out of me. I dont know how many nodes or the size of the breast tumor plan to ask next visit with Oncologist also going to pick his brain to see if he knows how long i have possibly had this for. Overall doing okay I have had some recent emotional crash and burn moments but just trying to stay positive and strong for my 3 kids ages 12,6,4.",

My HER2 took longer than normal as the first time it came back inconclusive and they had to run the FISH test for the HER2. I had my port placed on friday 12/2 and did the MUGA scan monday and now all results are back and chemo is a go for 12/14. I was as frustrated and scared as most people but I but my faith in God and took it one day at a time and I made sure I voiced my concerns and fears to my Oncology team. I hope this helps and feel free to chat any time. Just remember we are a STRONG breed of women and cancer doesn't stand a chance against us!",
