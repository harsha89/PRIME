So it's possible that they just identified it as a cyst. Though if you have a gut feeling, it's always best to get a second opinion. ",

Then they did a wire removal (go in, they had put a titanium clip at the site during the biopsy, they locate it through xray or something like that, then stick a wire in it, then they put you under and remove the area). For me they found atypical cells also in it, but nothing else. I felt the same way. I felt like every time they said something, I was waiting for the \"but...\" to come. But... it didn't. Try not to worry.",

I had a clear mammogram last October, and the lump they just removed was 4cmx4.5cm (I found it in May). To me, that sounds fast growing. It was ADH. And I have a family history (mother with premenopausal breast cancer, paternal grandmother with postmenopausal breast cancer; and I have no sisters or aunts at all) as well. My BS suggested Tamoxifen and close monitoring, but I feel like you, get them off me before they kill me. I was thinking nipple sparing with implants, but now that you've spouted off these other acronyms, I guess I have to look into it. I'm supposed to be seeing an oncologist and a plastic surgeon at the beginning of September, then back to see the breast surgeon again. I'll be following your decisions, if you care to post them.... ",

I've been to numerous doctors over the last 10 years (I'm 42). Chronic pain. The rheumatologist said I had all the symptoms of fibromyalgia but I didn't have it but she'd put me on the meds for it, but it didn't help at all. Turned out a lot of my muscle spasms were actually from food intolerances. Yet I still had chronic nerve pain. Finally found a good osteopath. I had low Vitamin D and I was just diagnosed 2 months ago with low thyroid, even though I've had symptoms for 4 years, which my regular doctor had poo-poo'd. I've been on a lot of anti-inflammatories (Pure Encapsulations makes a good one), and Magnesium is good for relaxing the muscles. I tried Tamoxifen and I could barely walk because of the hip pain. And with my 70% risk factor, I decided to go prophylactic. And now seeing all these theories tied together\" low thyroid, chronic pain, inflammation, and low vitamin D (and after 3 years of supplementation, they still haven't gotten me to the 50 target), I'm glad I didn't wait.",

Just curious because the rheumatologist thought I had fibro, and when I went off dairy, gluten, soy and corn (the top 4 food intolerances, and the ones that my kids had) my never-ending back spasms went away, and my thumb pain and my knee pain. Gluten is a problem with many auto immune diseases (celiac, RA, IBS, hashimoto's/grave's thyroid, and probably others) and it's inflammatory.  Not sure where you all live, but you might want to get checked for Lyme Disease as well (from a good lab like Igenex) because it can have many of the same symptoms.  And magnesium glycinate can help with muscle spasms (many people are low and don't know it; I had a blood test, but you're usually really low if it shows up on a blood test).  Just some things to think about.",
