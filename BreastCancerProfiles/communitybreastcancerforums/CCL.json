Im about to start radiation, after chemo, lumpectomy and 20 lymph nodes removed in L arm.  i already feel there is still swelling under arm and in upper arm from suergery that has not gone away and a slight numbness and tingling in upper arm.  The thought of getting LE is making me question whether i should do rad or not.  Can i still massage if i have it?  Side note.... how long till hair starts growing back and the weight the steroids put on come off?  I still cant believe this happend to me.  Freaking out and trying not to lose it emotionally every day.  Log in to post a reply",
