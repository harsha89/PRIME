(Even if you go to a surgeon, they would likely send you for a screening test next.) The results from the mammogram will determine your next step. Sometimes radiologists won't give results to the patient first - only to the ordering doctor.  Just depends.  Also ask the nurse in the gyn office if they would specify to fax the results to your doctor.  That speeds up the process.  Since this is breast cancer awareness month, you might also find out if your local health dept or other organization has free mammograms in your area. Google free mammograms and your city.  If there is a breast cancer center anywhere near you, they are also great - you can be seen by a doctor, get a screening all at the same time.  Anyway, those are some options.  Good luck & God bless.",

You might want to take advantage of the genetic test which will tell you if you have the gene mutation. I also wanted to avoid radiation esp. because mine was in left breast & radiation exposure to heart (as well as lungs).  Any surgery with gen'l anesthesia takes time to recover. You'll need plenty of rest either way.  My mastectomy was < two weeks ago (opted no reconstruction).  Recovery has been much better than I thought.  I only had to take regular tylenol now & then.  I had to have my appendix out in July and comparatively speaking, the mastectomy is much easier.   I'm nearly back to normal activity already (no heavy lifting yet).  The process & recovery is longer with reconstruction but is very important to many women.   Good luck with your decision - it's an individual one and you should be totally comfortable with whatever you choose.",

I hope this one goes as smoothly - I never had to take pain meds other than regular tylenol.  It was much easier recovery than the appendectomy (laproscopic).  My only advice is to do your spring cleaning now, freeze dinners and find out whether your surgeon will allow shower before drains are removed.  My surgeon is old school (at a NCI center) and prefers not to get anything wet until 1st follow-up appointment.  So I found these great body treated washcloths at CVS.  They are sort of like baby wipes only much bigger and softer.  You can even microwave them to warm them up before use.  I just shampooed my hair in the kitchen sink using the sprayer.  Also get a couple of boxes of those little alcohol wipes to clean the incision area of drains and the drain tubes.  And, best advice is to ramp up & get plenty of exercise now before surgery (surgeon told me that). Elmcity - thanks for starting thread!  Are you going to edit your original post to put names/surgery dates?",

First of all, no one can be 'sure' it's cancer or the actual size until the pathology is done.  So, hold on to that.  This may just be a scare.  In the meantime, the more you can educate yourself about options, the more in control you will feel.  Take time to think things through.  And even if you never need the information, you may be able to help someone else one day.   Are you having a needle biopsy?  Down the road if you actually do need further surgery, I would definitely recommend a breast surgeon (not a general surgeon) and one associated with a national cancer center.  Make sure you have copies of all your reports and your films (or CDs).  You probably know that you are limited to 5 posts/day at first (until 50 posts) because BCO has had problems with spam.  But you can always send a private message just by clicking on a name.  When I first joined here, someone sent me links to find top docs in America and national cancer centers by your zip code - so if you'd like those for future reference, just PM me & happy to send them along.

That's the same thing my surgeon explained - they take one or more nodes and have pathology do a quick analysis while you're still on the table.  If they come back positive, they take more nodes  If negative, they close.   Just to be sure, pathology does a more thorough analysis (slice by slice)of the nodes they tested while you were in surgery.  A small percentage (only about 10%) can show up positive when they do that further testing.  Not totally sure what happens then - maybe they go back in at a later point to take more.  Odds are in your favor.  Good luck.",

That's right - didn't opt for reconstruction right away.  Docs said I could always do it later if I wanted.  I am supposed to get my drain out tomorrow - Yay!  That's been annoying but not painful.  Since day one, still no pain meds except regular tylenol now and then -- and I;m a wimp when it comes to pain!  If I did have pain I wouldn't have hestitated to take the stronger pills.  I think part of the reason is that you get very numb around incision and SNB - takes time for sensation to come back when nerves start reconnecting (or whatever they do).  It's not a walk in the park, but it's not anywhere near as bad as I had expected.  Leanna - I'm in Vienna - grew up in Alexandria!

Verna - my surgeon said I might hear sloshing and that was fluid build up.  (I never did).  But, again I don't know anything about how the reconstruction may be different.  She told me if any pain started suddenly where you feel the sloshing to call right away - I think because may need to be aspirated to avoid infection.  So just keep that in mind and call your doc if you have concerns.  But, your drains certainly sound like they are working at 30 every 4 hours!",

For almost 2 weeks I couldn't push the flush handle on the toilet!   The first day I drove, I stopped at the drive-up window in bank and couldn't reach the darn capsule to make the deposit.  For the most part I could compensate with right arm, since I had left mastectomy.  So I can imagine it's harder when both sides are affected.",

East Coast - I think staging of any potential recurrence depends on a number of factors.  It's different if it is a local recurrence v. a distant recurrence so you might ask you onc to give you some peace of mind.  And, you can have a brand new cancer in opposite breast unrelated to the first one which is staged/treated the same as any initial cancer diagnosis.  With a mastectomy, chance of local recurrence is only about 1% (if lumpectomy & rads it is about 5% but I've seen as high as 15%).  That's why I chose mastectomy in the first place and am thinking about a prophy 2nd mastectomy. Yes, well.  I think the psychological healing takes longer than the physical healing.  I'm still trying to get my head around everything that has happened so fast.   I also think it's kind of a delayed reaction - because I was just focused on the surgery & recovery.  Now that it's over (or getting there) the rest of the worries start to creep in esp. with regard to the next round of decision making and all the \"what ifs\" which can drive you crazy.  And, I believe it will always be in the back of my mind -- all you can do is make informed choices and get back to living.  In that respect, I think there is actually one benefit to being a cancer survivor.  There is a greater appreciation for health and not putting off living & what you want to accomplish in life.  Many, if not most, people just assume they have all the time in the world.  Women have a higher risk of dying from heart disease than breast cancer, for example.  More people are killed in car accidents than by breast cancer.  And, the list goes on.  Just have to try to keep it in perspective - at least that's what I'm telling myself :)",

You just have to be religious about the exercises every single day.  As far as my experience, the first time around, at about 4 months, the stretching didn't hurt anymore but definitely still needed stretching.  At about 6 months I just kept the stretches in a regular exercise routine so I wouldn't slip backward in progress -  but didn't do the several times a day anymore.  Both my breast surgeon & physical therapist said on average it takes 6 mos to completely heal from this surgery -- even if you have complete range of motion.  It's all internal with regard to nerves healing, generation of new lymph pathways, tissue, etc.   I believe it this time because of the seroma.  (This new lymph pathway goes on even if no nodes were removed - and none were taken on the prophylactic side I just had done.) She said whether you develop a seroma or not, the body is producing fluid while you heal - most people aren't even aware of it because the body absorbs this excess fluid after drains are removed and some don't - and evidently they don't know why.  I just had another aspiration today and it is almost 7 weeks out!  (I had none of this the first time.)  She has me coming in every 2 weeks to check.  It was down to 25 cc today - but proof not everything is finished healing.  She said the lump/swelling will eventually go away too.  Just takes time.  Wish I was more patient!  Has your PT shown you scar massage?   That's what gets really tight for me across chest - more  than the arm actually.",

Yes!

Angelisa - maybe Herceptin is all you need?  I don't know.  I forgot what your oncotype score was.   I'm really struggling with AI decision.  If I don't take it, recurrence risk is 14%.  If I do take it, the risk is 7%.  But I'm fairly certain I'll have 100% bone side effects because I'm already in osteoporosis range.  I keep ignoring the other side of the equation - 86% no recurrence.  I'd hate to go through all this and never had needed it - but I sure don't want this to come back either.  I'm halfway thinking of asking about zometa infusions which is for bone loss but now they know it also reduces bc recurrence risks in bone and asking about getting on the Metformin trial.  Metformin is approved for diabetics but the drug also has similar results as AI/Tamox but fewer side effects.  A phase III trial is starting.  But then I might be in the group with placebo.  I HATE ALL OF THIS!!!

Yes - best advice is just to keep busy until surgery.  I cleaned my house, froze dinners, did a ton of yard work, etc.  Not only takes your mind off of it, but lets you relax more when you get home because everything is done!  Stock up on a couple of things like some gauze pads, that tape (not adhesive) that doesn't hurt.  Even though I wore a cami, where the drain comes out gets sore.  I found if I taped a fresh gauze pad over it each day (very lightly - you want air to circulate), it didn't get irritated.  There are also some great antibacterial wash cloths that are so soft and you can microwave to make them warm - esp. if your surgeon is like mine and did not want you to shower before first follow-up visit.  You can find them where band-aids are in the drug store (not those handiwipes - these are large).  I just washed my hair in the kitchen sink using the sprayer :)  Also alcohol prep swabs - they are good for wiping off the top of your drain when you handle it to keep it very clean.  Nurses will tell you all this - but it helps to know what you need ahead of time so that someone isn't always running to the drug store for you!",

Just take it easy, drink lots of fluids and do your breathing.  When you lie down on your back bend your elbows so your hands are up in the air and make fists 10-15 times.  Just gently - you don't want to stretch anything yet.  That pumps out lymph fluid and will make the hand swelling go down.  That's an Am Cancer Inst exercise.(My hand swelled on the mastectomy side.)  When you are walking around more, the swelling goes down more too.",

Myrrl - did you get one of the those post mastectomy camis?  Those are very soft and have two pockets for drains.  You could ask about more pockets if you're having 4 drains.  But I've heard all kinds of creative ways to cope with drains - lanyards, shoestrings, etc.  You just don't want to accidently tug on them. Otherwise they don't hurt - just very annoying.   Call and speak w/a nurse at your surgeon's office before you go out & spend money to see how the bra situation is handled & what they recommend.  They may send you home w/a compression bra or bandage or whatever. Sometimes they forget to tell you all the details unless you ask.",

I had also just had an emergency appendectomy.  I wanted to avoid radiation and no guarantee a 2nd lumpec would be clear.  Since I had to have more surgery anyway I opted for left mastectomy.  I would have done a bilateral but didn't want to push my luck with 3 surgeries w/anesthesia in such short time period and minimize the time I was under (uni vs. BMX).  So I decided to wait 6 mos and then schedule the right prophy - and here I am.  I just do not trust screenings as they didn't pick it up the first time.  And, I may not be so lucky if it came back in the remaining breast.  Altho survival is same for lumpec v. mastec, recurrence rates are lower with mastectomy.  Plus symmetry issues.   I discovered a new trick!  I couldn't tolerate the snug surgical bra - rubbed everywhere.  So the other day I put on a soft T shirt and then the surgical bra on top of that.  Worked like a charm!",

Eileen - go to the TLC site and look for the microbead forms!  They are super lightweight and you can just put in a regular bra without irritating anything (like the silicone breast forms that you have to wait 6 weeks after surgery to be fitted).  I found I could only wear the cami under really loose, bulky clothes and wanted to get back into my regular clothes.  So as soon as the drains were out that's what I did. Nobody can tell the difference - fooled myself! :)  Lot of women complain about the silicone forms being heavy and uncomfortable - I might just stick with the microbead forms.  ",

Happy- they told me only to stretch until you feel a little resistance (not pain).  My surgeon said no exercises until after drains were out (other than the gentle one where lying in bed putting hands up in the air.) There are some good ones on American  Cancer Society website you can print. Angelisa - my daughter is getting tested too.   They wanted to get my results first and then they'll do hers (not exactly sure why - i'm afraid her risk is actually higher because more BC on her father's side).

I was expecting her to say with my pathology that I need to take hormone blocker (chemo not indicated).  I was correct on that count - no surprises.  But here is what is completely different. Both the surgeon who did my excisional biopsy and the breast surgeon who did my mastectomy gave me the same recurrence figures when I was making surgery decision.  Survival rate is the same whether you choose lumpec/rads or a mastectomy.  Recurrence somewhat lower in mastectomy (about 1%) than lump/rads (anywhere 5 - 10%).  So, that has been my understanding about recurrence rates.  Today, Onc. said recurrence rate after lump/rads OR mastectomy WITHOUT hormone blocker is 20-30%.  WITH hormone blocker, it would be half or 10-15%.  These recurrence rates seem to be moving targets.  Anybody have a clearer picture?",

Once the cancer is there you have fewer options.  I have pretty much decided that I will have a right prophy in about six months.  I do not want to have to go thru mammos and MRIs every six months, painful biopsies, another SNB, and always worrying.  Hope that helps some.  It's only normal to wonder - but I think you chose the right path.  Don't look back - the future is lookin' bright :) As for the little lightning strikes (I call them) - yes!  But I they have started to go away pretty fast.  I'm a little ahead of you at 3 1/2 weeks.  So it gets better.  It's the nerves healing according to my surgeon. ",

Glad to hear all the good reports today!

I also asked her if I could use my 3 lb weights for arm exercises again - she said nothing heavier than soup cans for now!  (You can lift heavy things at this point (7 weeks) like full grocery bags, etc but not to do repetitive exercises with weights.  So that was interesting.

East Coast - yes Eileen (I think it was Eileen) was right when she posted some time ago that the stress really comes way after the surgery. I think some of that is going on with me in being so tentative to start the hormone therapy.  It's like I expect the worst of anything now after being blindsided w/bc. Angelisa - good luck on the insurance issues getting in place for your daughter.  And wonderful news you can say you're almost DONE with treatment.  Hope you haven't had anymore fast heartbeat episodes. Myrrl - when does spring semester start? Hopefully you have a few more weeks to rest.  I think my son's classes start back around the 20th - which means tuition is due soon:( Annette - how are you doing?  I saw you checked in few days ago!  It is a pain trying to pace blood tests in one arm.  I had one last week and the tech left a HUGE bruise.  Was supposed to get another one (diff. doc) and decided to wait a few days.  I don't want to wear it out. Girls, I have a GOOD feeling about 2011!!   It's going to be a year of breakthroughs in cancer treatment.  Already one announced today - a new revolutionary blood test.  Was on ABC evening news tonight.",

Got full cardiology workup after the chest pains w/Arimidex - EKG, echocardiogram, and stress test.  Doc said no problem w/blood flow and it wasn't due to cardiac function - could have been the meds or could have been a teeny piece of plaque that decided to break off.  So - who knows.  I still think it was Arimidex.  Not having issues so far anyway w/Tamox.  He asked what my LDL was and of course I couldn't remember- should have called my PCP.  He said if thats in high middle or borderline (100 -160) then a statin is a good idea.  He said there is a clinical trial going on now - because there is some indication that statins also reduce breast cancer recurrence as well as cardiac events!  (Remember that's the LDL level  or bad cholesterol, not total cholesterol level.) That's all for now.  Hope everyone doing OK.",

Catbill - today??  Prayers for easy surgery. East Coast - prayers for you too on 4th!  Time seems to go so slowly & then all of a sudden the day is here!   I think you have been so smart taking all the precautions that you have.",
