Before my mastectomy, I was diagnosed with DCIS.  I chose at that time to have them both removed.  I had a mammogram, magnified mammogram, MRI and stereotactic biopsy.  Every single one of those missed the fact I had 3 IDC tumors in my left breast, and one on my lymph node.  If the best tests we have for breast cancer aren't perfect, and we have even less for ovarian cancer, I wasn't about to take a chance.  My ob/gyn and I debated about the removal of the uterus.  She was neither for nor against it, so the decision was totally mine.  And I know myself well enough to realize I would have done nothing but worry that there was cancer in it.  I have always had issues with unusual bleeding, but never had fibroids or anything.  I just decided to clean house and be done with it. I couldn't be more pleased.  It hasn't even been a week, and I'm not on any pain meds or anything.  The only pain is when my bladder and large instestine have to do their work, and there is a space there they are filling in.  My Dr assured me it will go away in a couple of weeks, once everything settles.  And thank you for thinking I'm young :-)  I was 39 at diagnosis, 40 now.   ",

I'll be starting arimidex this week.  5 years to go......",

I haven't had my BMX yet.  I meet with the plastic surgeon on Monday, then I will be able to schedule.  I am having the SNB on the left side where we know for sure I have 2 areas of DCIS.  I am not having the right side done, where we just suspect it.   My surgeon said that in cases like mine (brca2, high grade, I'm only 39, mri showing it may be going invasive) about 20% of his cases end up with a finding of cancer in the SNB.  So they will take mine out, send it off the lab, and procede with the BMX.  They get the answer back during the surgery, and if it's clear, the plastic surgeon will begin reconstruction right then.  If it's not clear, the plastic surgeon gets to go play golf, and I get a delayed reconstruction.   I think that is the hardest part for me, going under and not knowing what will be there when I wake up.   I know I should get the right side biopsied.  But I think the exact words I used with the surgeon was \"you can stick another needle in my breast after you pry it from my cold, unconscious body\".  I know alot of women said the stereotactic biopsy was not a big deal, but for me it was excruciating.  Seriously, I'd rather lose the breast then relive it.  IF I had it biopsied, and IF it was DCIS, then yah, I'd do the SNB there too.  Here is where I get to insert the right to denial...... Have you gotten a second opinion?  That's the nice thing about DCIS, you have time.  I had a couple of surgeons look at my tests, everyone agreed the BMX with the SNB was the best decision.  A second opinion may give you some peace of mind on that.  I don't really know what the chance of lymphedema is with a SNB, but to me, it is no small undertaking.  If your surgeon says you don't need, I would probably go with that.  Messing with the lymph system is no small undertaking.",

Ann - sounds like you have had a tough few months just to GET to surgery.  I hope you are able to get your TE's! I worry they will find cancer in my SNB, because if they do they will cancel my Lat Flap and I'll come home flat.  I told my husband that is the FIRST thing he has to say to me when I wake up from surgery.  Foobs or no Foobs.

KelleyOD - I worried that the immediate recon may not be a good idea.  My left breast has 2 areas, one near the nipple and one near the chest wall, so if they can't get a clean margin on the chest wall I'd have to do rads probably.  But my PS said he would make that call during the mastectomy.  If I will need rads, or if the SNB comes back positive (the lab does it during the BMX so they will know right away) then the PS doesn't operate.  He gets a nice unexpected afternoon off. Stephanie - WOW that is alot of surgery.  But honestly, I think that's great you can have it all at once. Less hospital time overall.  I sort of wish I had told them to do my ooph during my BMX.  I just wasn't ready to go there yet.  I'm sorry you have to go thru all this a second time.  Hopefully once the girlz are off, you won't have to worry about it again. DanaDane - Let us know how the brca test comes back.  It is so hard when things change mid-swim like that.  Check out pictures online of the reconstructed nipples.  The tattoo isn't all that, but at least it is something.   kks_rd - Yay for chemo being over!  Hopefully the lumpectomy will be a breeze compared to that. GrandmaV - I am glad you joined us, shy or not.  I hear ya, everytime I feel a twinge in my breast, I am sure that is another area of cancer starting.  I know that is silly, cause that isn't how cancer grows, but I can't help it.  I just want the darn things off of me now. rachelvk - I'm actually jealous of the folks who are moving along so fast.  My original mammo was back in June.  I feel like this is eating up my life.  So have you decided whether or not to be the first DIEP?  Thing is, there is always someone who is first.  I'm sure if you decide that route, it will be just fine. Eema - I'll be going the ooph route next year.  So absolutely, grab a drink and join us.  Yesterday I told my PS that if I wake up and my boobs are in my armpits, I am so totally coming after him.  That is what I fear.  Arm cushions instead of Foobs.  Hopefully the revision will fix that! Clams - I get the message boards being too much for your wife right now.  I have days I can't even look at them.  She is going thru so much, and the added worry of having to care for your kids just makes it all that much harder.   Give her a nice gentle hug for us, and if she does want to join in, we would be happy to chat.  There are a few of us on here that have younger children (I have a 5 year old) so we certainly understand. AJ - Huge hugs.  Like you really needed insurance stress on top of all this!  The PS office probably just didn't submit something correctly.  All it takes is one wrong code.  Hopefully they will have to figured out and you won't have to go into insurance fightin' mode.  I'm sorry your son is still sick :-( Mardibra - Praying and hoping for a BIG FAT NOTHING on that U/S and biopsy!  Keep us posted! Judy67 - My surgery is the 4th too.  One of the things that I hate the most is that I will have no idea when I am put under if I will awaken with a different diagnosis.  Because my DCIS is high grade with comedonecrosis, and because I have a defective BRCA2 gene, my BS said there was about a 20% chance of finding it is invasive and in the lymph node.  I don't like that number, I was hoping more for a 0% chance.  The inability to have control over any of this drives me nuts. Gail64 - I'm having a lat flap done on both sides as well.  I will have implants underneath the flaps so that I am closer to my original size.  They will put in the TE's and fill 'em up over the next couple of months.  Maybe we should go peak over at the surgery boards from Sept and Aug to see if anyone else had the lat flap done on either side.  It would be interesting to see other women's stories. CLC - Welcome aboard.  I think that makes the wait harder, not knowing for sure if you will have a UMX or BMX.  Hopefully your BRCA test will come back quickly.  I was lucky, I was part of a study and had my brca test back in 2008, so I have known all along I have a bum gene.  It made that decision really easy. I am walking around braless today.  I never do that, because I'm a large D, and I have always been worried if I don't wear a bra, my girlz would hit my knees by the time I'm 40.  And there is my silver lining.  My foobs will never look anything other then perky and new.  They will never meet my knees.  Hopefully they won't be in my armpits, and hopefully I won't be able to rest my chin on them.  But for today, I can sag all I want. :-)",

They will be doing a SNB during the surgery, because it is high grade and multifocal, but only on the left side where we know there is dcis, not the right side.",

The left side where they took all the lymph nodes is not feeling as well as I thought it would.  I can't lift it over my head yet, and I have alot of pain all they way down to my elbow.  I'm hoping in time that gets better.   I had my drains taken out at my 2 week post op, even though 2 of them were still draining a ton.  The Dr wanted to leave them in longer, but the infection made that impossible.  Now I have quite a bit of fluid buildup.  If it doesn't start to reabsorb, they want to take it out by needle.  Blech.  On the upside, the fact they left a LOT of skin for reconstruction combined with the fluid gives me sort of an A cup.  If I roll it all up into a bra.  Not quite the D's I had before, but at least it isn't a cavern I can rest my coffee cup in. It is a GORGEOUS fall day here, and we are expecting lots of snow tomorrow.  I am finding so much pleasure in these little things.  I wish that much peace for all of you :-) ",

Ann - YAY on the last chemo!  At least it is one thing you can check of your list of things to do :-) Ah2bthin - YAY on chemo done for you this week!   I've had so many surgeries, the best advice I can give you is to let them know you are stressed.  They can give you meds to help with that.  The anticipation is the hardest part.  I'm glad you joined us so we can support you the best we can! Rachelvk - I wish I had a choice between a DIEP and a Lat Flap.  Lat flap was all either surgeon would do.  So much for a free tummy tuck :-)  Which one are you leaning toward?  The recon is the only part I'm nervous about.  It's just such a hard recovery.  Survivor11 - So glad you are feeling better after chemo!  How many kids do you have?  I'm having a hard time remaining busy while I wait for surgery.  My daughter is in kindergarten, so my house is very, very quiet now.  I have the TV or Ipod on all day now, just so I hear something besides my own thoughts.  Well, on Friday I went to the salon and had them cut 8 inches off my hair.  I was worried my long hair would get all tangled in drains and incisions and stuff.  It wasn't quite long enough this time to donate to locks of love, which is a shame cause I've done that before.  But now I feel like I'm doing something to prepare myself.   ",

I don't think it scares women, as much as gives a complete picture.  It's going to be different for everyone.  You take care of you, and if and when you are ready and able to post, we'll be here :-)",

My only thing would be... you can always take the other one of later, but you can never get it back.  I am dreading the loss of normal feeling.  Of course, if you get it all done at once, then maybe it's easier to match for reconstruction.... so basically, I'm no help at all.  I don't envy the choice you have to make.  Are you going to have a reconstruction? ",

Trinity - Grab and drink and join the party!   I'm having meltdown moments too.  I had to have my husband call my daughter's school to reschedule her parent/teacher conference (it is during my hospital stay) because I kept crying everytime I tried to pick up the phone and dial.  I figure if I get all my tears out now, then afterwards I won't have any more, and I can just give it all to healing.  Dukes_UP - I actually asked my PS about blood transfusions during BMX and recon, because I had to initial that I don't have any religious objections to them.  He said he has never had to do a blood transfusion for my procedure before.  I think it's fairly rare, unless you have some sort of underlying medical condition.  I can't bank my own blood, cause I am already having to take iron twice a day for anemia.  I gots to keep what RBC's I have.  Kellyconboy - Welcome aboard!  I am BRCA2 as well.  I'm not having my ooph till later though.  I just wasn't ready, and fortunately I don't have a history of ovarian cancer in my family.  I'm so sorry to hear about your mother.  I can't imagine how hard that was for you.  AWESOME job on the weight loss.  I kept thinking I'd get around to that before surgery... but here I am a week away and still haven't started. kks_rd - I'm sorry there isn't more info out there for you.  I would think that the lumpectomy is more common the a mastectomy, so there would be tons.  Are you done with chemo now? I can imagine that is enough to deal with. Kcobb - October 13th is alllll yours.  Hopefully 2011 will be much kinder to you then 2008 was!   Lisa - I'm so sorry you had to be rescheduled!  Gah.  You must be climbing the walls.  Cry away, lady.  I hope that the 3 weeks goes by quickly for you! Ladies, I will be gone from Wednesday thru Saturday on a mommy/daughter trip to visit family.  I have no idea if I will be online during that time.  I'll have my laptop with me, but I don't know if I'll have internet access.  If anyone has changes or wants to be added, I'll get it Saturday night for sure if I can't get here.   We are a week away from surgeries starting.  YIKES.   And I decided to skip the Race for the Cure this year.  Denver has a huge one, and I usually walk in it.  But I am growing the cancer they are trying to cure, so that is my contribution this time.  I'll walk again next year, but with a pink hat on.",
