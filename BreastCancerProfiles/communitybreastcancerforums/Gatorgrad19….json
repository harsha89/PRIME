I had an MRI and there is a \"tail\" to the mass which is 3 cm longer than what originally thought. I also have at least 2 lymph nodes involved. Went to surgeon on Friday, ready to schedule surgery, but he threw me for a loop. Said he wanted to start with chemo to shrink the tumor before surgery (called neoadjuvant chemo). So now I have to meet the oncologist, have a port put in, go through orientation. Feels like I will never get started. Yes, I am very scared. Has anybody else had chemo before surgery?",

I am T3 N1(right now). 16 weeks of chemo every 2 weeks. Then surgery, then radiation, then reconstruction. Have a feeling I am going to be doing this for a long time! I will gladly go through all of the pain and suffering if I know I will be okay. My youngest son just finished his first year at the University of South Florida (Tampa). Today I went to get a wig, etc., and he insisted upon buying my first scarf. \"Happy Mother's Day, Mom.\" I know he is very nervous. David has mild cerebral palsy and we went through many years of PT with him. He told me, \"Now it's my turn to take care of you, Mom.\" I guess I'm rambling. Hope I can sleep tonight, have to be up at 5:20 in the morning.",
