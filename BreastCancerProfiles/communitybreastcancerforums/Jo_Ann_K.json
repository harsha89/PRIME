The rad oncologist had never seen this kind of rash is the many years he has been practicing, so I went to the dermatologist.  The dermatologist I chose did his residency at Johns Hopkins, and after having worked there for a while, I know that they see WEIRD things there.  Anyway, the dermatologist said he wasn't quite sure either. He had never seen this reaction before either. He took a small sample from one of the weird spots and looked at it under a microscope thinking it could be a fungus.  Apparently, it's not uncommon to develop fungus after skin damage, but it wasn't that. So, he's treating it like a folliculitis for now - with topical antibiotic and steroids, and in two weeks if there is no improvement, he'll take a biopsy and we'll go from there.  I was surprised to think I could get a folliculitis from that, but he said radiation does serious skin damage and almost anything is possible.  I'll continue to keep you posted as this mysterious skin thing spreads. One thing I'll say for myself. I never have a normal response to anything. I always have to do it up big...sigh So",

I use lotion on the at least twice a day since starting radiation so dry skin is absurd. Anyway, the radiologist said he's never ever seen that reaction.

Here I am, 53 years old, still menstruating and found out today I have DCIS.  My mother died of metastatic breast cancer after being \"cured\".  At year seven, she felt something in her jaw and three weeks later died from a very agressive return of her tumor.  My mother's mom and her sisters all died from uterine or breast cancer.  While I knew there was a tremendous possibility of becoming a statistic, I always hoped it would be different.  The good news is that I'm living proof that yearly mammograms serve a purpose.  The DCIS was discovered at a very early stage - low grade. The radiologist advised that I'll probably only need surgery and radiology.  I have already made an appointment with the surgeon for Monday morning.  I want this \"out\" of me! My brother, who is a pathologist, thinks with the family history I should talk to the doctor about getting a prophylactic double mastectomy.  I'm really against this...having surgery without really knowing what your odds are.  So...I'm wondering what all of you who have had this experience think.  Meanwhile, I worry for my two twenty-something daughters...both grandmothers, mother, and great grandparents....it's frightening.

Meanwhile, to compound things, my husband has to have a cardiac catherization next week. Here he is the piller of all the things you should do correctly - he ate yogurt and wheat germ when they didn't even have flavors yet.  Watches every drop of fat that goes into his body. Takes flax seed oil and cinnamon every day, and he's been experiencing chest fullness and some shortness of breath.  A thallium stress test showed everything was fine, but there was a slight change on the static EKG and our internist sent him back to the cardiologist who just wants to make sure that everything is okay. He feels that there is only a 20% chance he has a blockage. Frankly, I think he's got a hiatal hernia, but I don't blame the internist for being cautious. He's only 55 (he'll be 56 next week), but there is a lot of heart disease in his family.  I can't take much more than this.... Marie, welcome to our little \"club\".  I just love hearing about everyone's diverse careers.  And it seems there are a lot of nurses who worked in oncology on this board BEFORE they were diagnosed.  It makes you wonder if that viral theory is true.

On Friendships: I found that some friends were calling daily and some stepped away until I finished the initial surgery and started radiation. I'm convinced it is more because of their level of discomfort in dealing with a peer's illness and the fact that cancer can lead to mortality than any actual reflection of their feelings about me.  My friends who had endured the illness of friends and relatives were much more available when I was going through treatment than those who hadn't had that experience.  It was a good lesson to learn that coping with illness is a different experience for everyone. On Am I Really Sick?: I don't look sick. I don't feel sick. I no longer have cancer in my body as far as I know, but am I going to be labeled \"sick\" the rest of my life or the \"lady who has breast cancer?\"  I was talking with a workmate who is about 2 weeks behind me in treatment, and we both agreed that we want to move on.  Leave the pink ribbon gifts, guidance books, and other cancer information to the new folks who need to absorb all they can to make the correct course of treatment.  I want to go back to the land of the living. On Exhaustion:  My daughters reminded me that I was always sleepy for the past couple of years before my diagnosis no matter how much sleep I got.  I'd go to a movie and sleep in the middle of the movie.  It wasn't until after the lumpectomy and after the 2nd week of treatment that I finally starting 'waking up' and not needing a nap during the day.  Maybe it was the cancer all along giving me a message I didn't get until after the fact.  The good news is that I'm feeling more energetic than I have in years! One final note, I'm still not convinced that our lifestyles as healthcare workers do not have some impact on our risk of breast cancer.  Of course, many of us seek this field because of our experiences with sickness prior to choosing a career, but we are exposed to a lot of \"stuff\" while practicing our trade. It can't be discounted.  For what it's worth... Happy New Year! Regards, Jo Ann from Maryland",

Great to hear from you!  I've been an RN since 1977.  I started my career in the hospital environment on a skin unit, end of life unit, and general surgery. Then I worked in home care for 14 years including staff nurse, hospice nurse, intake nurse, and quality assurance nurse. I worked in the insurance industry for a few years, and since then, I have dedicated the rest of my career to nursing informatics (nursing and information systems).  I started the first full service network for nurses on the Internet, introducing continuing education through the University of Maryland in 1993, before the web as we know it today!  It was called the Nursing Network. I worked for Microsoft for 5 years, promoting the Nursing Network on the Microsoft Network, along with a Comedy community and Senior community. When Microsoft changed their direction, I worked on a telemedicine project for the Department of Defense for a year and then went back into the hospital environment as a \"computer\" nurse helping to develop clinical systems and find ways to help nurses document their work most efficiently with minimal risk to the hospital.  Today, I am the project manager for the Patient Portal, where the large hospital system I work for, will provide a way for patients to access their health records online as well as renew prescriptions, make appointments, hospital referrals, and get educational information on our website. This secure email messaging between patients and their doctors and hospitals is the future of healthcare.  So as you can see, I have also had a variety of jobs within our field. How did your employer handle your treatment when you were first diagnosed?  I can remember that if I ever took a day off when I was in direct patient care, my employer was shooting daggers at me.   As for me, my manager has made it clear that my health is the most important thing and that I should not, under any circumstances, put my job first while I get through these weeks ahead.   Most of my work has been day shift, with some evening shifts while I was in the hospital environment.  Regards, Jo Ann",

My recommendation would be to find a job in nursing that is more sedate.  I'm in informatics and feel like I still practice nursing by adding my clinical knowledge to the workflow, design, and development of electronic/computer clinical systems.  There are many other alternatives to traditional nursing that will pay as well or better in some cases.  The beauty of our profession is that all the skills we have learned in our jobs can be applied to other specialties within and out of nursing.  I have never met a nurse with bad time management skills. You can't be a successful nurse without superior organizational skills. And, in general, our leadership skills are honed on a daily basis as we wind our time and organizational management skills around ridiculous workloads.  Be creative...apply for jobs that will grow your skills.  Consider working in medical records, compliance, performance improvement, education, information systems, etc.  You have so much to offer. If anyone would like me to review their resume and suggest some employment direction, I'd be delighted to do that.  Not that I'm a professional headhunter, but I've worked in multiple jobs to grow professionally throughout my career and know a lot of what is out there. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Dec 20, 2012 08:54AM - edited Dec 20, 2012 08:54AM by Jo_Ann_K Hi Everyone! It's been a little over 4 years since I started this thread because so many nurses seem to get breast cancer.  I am curious to hear where everyone is at this point.  Hopefully, everyone is still alive, NED, and enjoying life.  As for me, I only have 1 year and 1 month on Tamoxifen to finish before ending my active preventive treatment.  I have some head to toe residual skin issues as a result of the radiation therapy. I learned from my dermatologist, after the fact, that radiation shocks the \"skin-nervous\" system, and sometimes issues last forever. It beats having cancer, but it is annoying never the less.  I have been fortunate to have minimal side effects from the Tamoxifen. A little over a year after the lumpectomy, I started to bleed from the nipple of the cancer breast resulting in an excision of part of my nipple. While the tissue was abnormal, it was not cancer, and the cause was a very small papilloma (wart).  The whole reason for going through the full gamet of treatment (surgery/radiation/hormone therapy) was to hopefully prevent recurrence since my Mom died of breast mets and her mom (and her sisters) all had female hormone cancers. While the BRCA tests were negative, the geneticist felt that there was likely an aberrant gene mutation, so all the doctors agreed it was the right course to take.  I was just lucky enough to catch it at the DCIS stage due to yearly mammograms. So how about everyone else?  Happy Holidays to all. Warm Regards, Jo Ann",

I'm just being mindful of heavy lifting so I don't strain the suture line (3-4\" long). Good luck! ",

Pertaining to the privacy of the medical data. Every health care organization that gets paid by an insurer has a contractual relationship with that insurer that enables the insurer to view your records if they are in relation to payment for your health care.  That's part of the HIPAA law.  So while you have some level of privacy pertaining to other health care providers who are not directly treating you, you really do not have total privacy for companies paying for your health care.  That's why it's a good idea to read the Notice of Privacy Practices that every health care provider or organization should give you prior to giving you care. It's amazing what you read there!  Yet, most of us just sign the document, because the font is too small to read; it takes too much time to read; and we're pushed by personnel to sign it quickly.

It is a sad commentary that today's nurses have been sold a bad bill of goods that they will go into nursing and all be managers and won't have to do any of the dirty work like actually \"care\" for a patient's most basic needs. I also came from the generation that worked as long as I was needed, even if the clock passed eight hours. I never left a patient in need without someone taking over. I CARED for my patients in every way. Today, I work outside of the healthcare system for the first time in my career. I use my nursing informatics skills for a government contractor. The envt is calm. People respect each other and actually help as needed. The lack of stress is quite an adjustment, but oh so lovely. No more of the crap and desperation for me.

On another note, have you ever wondered if any of your experiences in other countries may have exposed you to environmental issues that may have induced the breast cancer?  On a personal note, I can't keep my mind on my job just waiting for my breast MRI results.  The results were supposed to be back by today, but the surgeon didn't have them yet.  It's just making me nuts since the results will guide the surgery that I end up with on October 1st. Regards, Jo Ann ",

Bar62, I had a very similar career to yours. When I worked in patient care, I spent most of it with the Visiting Nurse Association working in hospice as well.  Having my lumpectomy in 5 days...",

Today, he took a biopsy of the latest skin rupture and I'll know more in 10 days. He tells me it's really nothing to be concerned about. While a rare response, it does happen and it may take some time, but eventually it will resolve.   I guess I should be grateful it's nothing more, but I thought in September, I'd be \"finished\" after the lumpectomy and radiation. I figured the Tamoxifen would become a way of life,  like a coffee in the morning, which it has turned out to be. The skin issues just keep the cancer going in my head.  I want it to go away...sigh.",
