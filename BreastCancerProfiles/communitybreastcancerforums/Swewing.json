Everything feels like it's moving very fast now. I meet with plastic surgeon tomorrow, breast mri on Friday and surgeon consult next week. Then double mastectomy with reconstruction April 9th. I'm so sorry to hear that some of you had the taxol nose bleeds. I'm not sure if it helped or if I just didn't have that SE but I use a humidifier at night. Keep strong ladies, you are warriors and I respect the drive it takes to travel this journey. I'm going to head over to the surgery thread to find out what I'm in for now. I just ordered two zip up camisoles with pockets/slots for drain tubes. I guess my insurance will pay for them. Take car",

I had port placement and sentinel lymph node biopsy surgery on 12/1 and I felt like I had been hit by a truck! I felt like a wuss. When I woke up from surgery I had horrible shooting pain near my nipple where they had injected the radioactive dye. Then I found out (after puking most of the night) that I am severely intolerant of narcotics. I didn't eat or drink much all weekend and then tried to go to work on Monday. I only lasted an hour and a half. Then I read online about drinking electrolytes and flushing out your system. I felt so much better after downing 2 Gatorades! I start chemo on 12/12 As for your question about tests, I started with blood work and chest x-ray. Then had a breast mri, that was horrible for me, I had a panic attack. During the mri, doc saw a cyst on my liver so ordered a pet scan. Also had an echocardiogram. Oh and ordered genetic testing but that hasn\u2019t happened yet",

Well I had my 1 week post chemo appt to go over symptoms so I told my dr about the headache. I guess a small percentage of people experience a headache from the zofran anti nausea med in the iv before chemo. She is switching out that drug and hopes that will take care of it. I also started on Pepcid for the heartburn and will continue taking the lorazepam to help me sleep. I really hate the jittery feeling from the steroids too. My worst days are days 1-4, then I started to feel better. I'm hoping that continues as it wasn't so bad. I started a countdown 3 more AC and 12 more taxol to go",

I was so dreading my AC #4 yesterday, but thenmy oncologist told me that since I'd done so well, I get to do just 4 dose dense taxol. I'm half way through! That lifted my spirits. I get so cold when I'm getting chemo that I bought a super soft electric blanket. It keeps me toasty. I also hate the taste when they rinse out my port so yesterday I ate lifesavers and plugged my nose. That worked for me. I'm still getting my period too, it's coming tomorrow. I was really looking forward to not having a period, but no such luck yet",

Then we picked a real-hair wig that looks almost exactly like my hair, I really love it. I look at it when I get sad about my hair falling out, helps give me confidence. The wig specialist told me not to shave my head. She said that will cause acne on my head. She said don\u2019t cut it too short either.

I\u2019m having a port put in this week and will do a sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time. Dr also ordered a pet scan as there was a spot on my liver, probably a cyst. I\u2019m waiting on insurance approval for genetic testing. I start chemo AC+T on 12/12. I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old, any recommendations on a good picture book to help them understand chemo? After chemo, I\u2019ll have surgery. I feel much better now that I know the order of treatments and have a plan. Still in a little bit of shock at how fast this is all moving, but at times it seems to drag on - you know?!?
