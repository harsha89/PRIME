IDC in the left breast and lymph nodes...did chemo first (dose dense ACT) followed by lumpectomy and radiation. Now here I am almost 9 years later...IDC, same breast. In just 2 weeks I have had a mammo, an ultrasound, a biopsy, another mammo, genetic testing, a pet scan, a muga scan, 2 oncologist appointments and one surgeon appointment...along with work! I forgot how fun this all was! LOL  Saw the oncologist today and all results are in...triple negative like before, BRAC2 positive, pet scan clear and muga looks great! I will be doing chemo first again but a new combo this time, Carboplatin and Gemzar, followed by a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and then some work on the ovaries somewhere in not so distant future. Port insertion is next Thursday with first chemo the day after, September 9th...2 days after my 51st birthday.  Other than some tears..ok..alot of tears the day I got confirmation, I am doing way better than last time...its the unknown that is so scary....but I have done this before..and I will do it again...and again...for as long as it takes! My grade 3 cells responded amazingly to chemo the first go around and the tumor was completely gone when surgery time rolled around. The new cocktail makes me a little nervous just because I KNOW the other worked so well...but new studies show promise with Carboplatin for triple negative.  I shaved all my shoulder length hair off the first time around (yeah..that sucked!) and after reading mixed results for Carboplatin and hair loss I am going to test the waters and see what happens....I am expecting complete loss so if I get something less it will just be a nice surprise. I work full time and am going to try to continue that with a modified position and will be having chemo on Fridays and take the weekend to regroup!  I look forward to chatting with you all and following along on this journey we are all making! Best of luck to all of us!!  ",

I had my port put in on Thursday without any problems and pretty much slept on the couch all day after that. First chemo session was yesterday and other than the 4 hour wait on paperwork (due to the fact the center never sent it to my insurance...don't get me started!) it went off with no further snafus! I am doing Carboplatin and Gemzar and other than a slight under the weather feeling I am doing pretty good. Almost nine years ago I did dose dense ACT so I am hoping things seem a bit easier this time..though I am ALSO nine years older. I have read mixed reviews on hair loss with this combo so I am going to go ahead and count on it and be happily surprised if it stays albeit thinner (its thick as it is so we'll just see). I shaved it off the first time around, bought an expensive wig that got worn twice and pretty much lived in hats and bandanas. Today I ordered some human hair bangs and a couple of ruffled snood/bandana pull ons that look cute and will go with those if the hair decides it wants to tuck tail and run hide. I will get just the Gemzar this Thursday or Friday and then have 2 weeks off and then start the cycle all over again. I plan to return to work on Monday with a modified job and they are being great about it...for now anyway...I hope that continues. I am taking my Zofran pretty much every 6 hours for these next 3 days because I don't want to test the waters. I did an Emend tri pack for the three days after chemo last time with the ACT and never threw up once....I'd like it to be the same way this time. I had a consult with a plastic surgeon and will have one more with another to decide my plan of action. I need to do some research on implant VS diep reconstruction. I would have to drive an hour 1/2 to 2 hours if I want diep as they are not done any closer than that for me. Can anyone chime in on this if you have already had surgery? Going to take a nice shower and run a couple of errands then take it easy for the rest of the weekend. I have been told day 3 may be a sort of crashing day for me so I would like to keep up on the small things I feel comfortable doing until that happens. Wishing all of you great days ahead and strength to get through the not so great ones! Hugs all around!  ",

I'm pretty new here but have been reading non stop.  I found a lump in my armpit 4 days before my scheduled annual with the OB/GYN.  That was Nov. 2nd. Had mammogram and ultrasound on Nov. 8th, biopsy on the 9th, CT scans, bone scan on the 12th along with positive diagnosis of tumor in breast and lymph nodes.  Original plan was chemo, surgery, radiation.  Then when I couldn't get in on a clinical trial due to core biospy instead of needle biopsy we decided on surgury, chemo, radiation .  Just had MRI on Saturday, results on Tuesday show tumor at 2.7 cm vs the 1.7 cm measured on the ultrasound.  Surgery (lumpectomy and lymph node removal) was scheduled for Monday (12-3) but now I just got a call from the surgeon who said after reviewing the MRI results with the oncologist they think we should go back to chemo, surgery, radiation to try and shrink the tumor first and to be able to visually see how the tumor is responding to the chemo using ultrasound.  So now a few questions (and of course the oncologist office is closed)....so I'm still having the port put in on Monday.  Is there a waiting period after that before I can start chemo.  I want started on something, ANYTHING, now!  Should I be able to start the chemo next week as well?  And for anyone who had chemo first then surgery..how did it go and why did they think that was best.  My surgeon is afraid of the cosmetic result of the lumpectomy unless we do chemo first to shrink it.  At this point I'm not too concerned about a cosmetic result...I just want to get started at something that will start killing this stupid thing that is interfering with my life!  Thanks for letting me rant a bit...Info or advice please!!  Lori Don't wait until everything is perfect before you decide to enjoy your life!

Opietaylor - My MRI also showed the tumor larger than on the ultrasound which my doctor said was usual, so now instead of 1.7 cm on ultrasound it shows 2.7 cm on MRI.  Anyone know is that normal...showing larger on MRI?  Anyway, I guess I'm as ready as I can be for surgery on Monday so please think of me and I'll keep you updated!  At least I'm going to get 2 weeks off work!!  Hopefully I'll feel good enough to enjoy it!!  Lori",
