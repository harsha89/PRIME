Both mammo and u/s were negative but MRI lit up my DCIS. I'm thankful for their diligence. My breasts were very dense. I had a bilateral mastectomy and now am being evaluated for a reoccurrence in a lymph node . Good luck and I'm sorry for your anxiety and waiting but early and rapid diagnosis is everything! Good luck and always be your own advocate. Mim",

I was dx with DCIS Grade 3 with Comedo Necrosis on 11/17 and am scheduled forma double MX with TE on 11/7 with SNB the day before. The MRI shows an \"area of concern\" extensive and near the chest wall which dictates the MX on my left. Right is clear. My interaction with the female Breast surgeon was borderline offensive but I also know she has better surgical skills than her bedside manner. I am a Nurse and should know better, but I felt manhandled after the experience, wham bam \"any questions\".. This after an extensive contentious discussion about why I wanted a Prophylactic MX, my husband was stunned. So, I am over it, moving forward..glad so, glad to have you all to share with, learn from etc.. In contrast, the plastic surgeon was thorough, kind, caring and just a breath of fresh air..I will have a far more extensive and personal relationship with him, so that seems more important to like his bedside manner.. I am getting the impression that this is \"Outpatient Same Day Surgery\" WHAT?? Thanks..Mimi..(another one) :)",

      "Content": "Dec 3, 2013 11:08AM - edited Dec 3, 2013 04:49PM by Mimi68 hi ladies, a few tips: For stool softening I took two Walgreens brand dulcolax gentle women's tabs am and pm and it worked well. I agree get out and walk a mile every day. Water water water and prune juice or fig newtons do t hurt either. As far as drains, I bout a few poly stretchy spandex Camis that were nice and fitted and cheap at Marshall's in the lingerie section and cut a line straight down the armpits to let the drains fall freely, inside or outside works fine-I liked outside and just pinned to the side/ front waist level. You can empty them with out pinning and when worn on outside stripping is easy. Also you can pull them on as opposed to over the head. I them wore button from Jammie top over to stay warm. For showering I was given a long piece of tube gauze to drape around my neck and I pinned drains to them. Worked great!! Good luck to all who are coming up and to all who are Waiting for Path reports :) Scar cream with silicone I'm trying today is 19.99 from Walgreens scar derma. It has a roller ball. PS also suggested daily massage of scar.. Best.. Mimi",

Thanks for your encouragement in letting me know you all are struggling with fatigue and even a bit of Depression Mimi32 which is how I felt, briefly at the way my body is calling the shots! I have to listen. Keets858, My PS RN did clear me to run but having said that, perhaps I need to clarify with him, so far 3 miles every other day and I am spasming way more, likely TE movement. I will ask today at a fill. I am so happy for you that yu are doing well, I return 12/27. Driving going well too. nancyjeanne1967..please hang in there, my left side where two nodes came out is way tighter and more painful but with my husbands urging, I have stayed on track 3x day with my exercises and it will hurt but stay on it, I am way looser!! My OT appt. 1 week post op was awesome in advising me of doing the exercises well and how often..PT may be very very helpful for you..Not everyone can push alone through the painful exercises. I had to remeber to be good to myself and give myself a break. We just moved and I am going through boxes but at 4pm now, I am on the couch, period..it helps!!! HVV the best thing about my surgery planning was having a detailed discussion on the day of surgery with the Anesthesiologist about my prior experience with adverse effects of general anesthesia, ie: nausea nd vomiting for days..I was set back a week form it, I had FABULOUS anesthesia which included a nerve block..a world of difference!!! recovery was wonderful and I ate a burger that night!! JMFrankel..I am filled to 210 now going to 250 today, I have 350 TE's in I am 128 lb 5'6\" and had a med b cup before. I would like a nice c cup. Are you accessing the reconstruction gallery yet? I need help!!! I am doing Mentor silicone but unsure of moderate plus profile of High profile..and size, who knows??? Also, one question about my Path..what is considered \"good\" margins\" for DCIS? i think mine were .4mm, that seems awfully small.. but I have no reference point.. best wishes ladies...Thanks in advance for all the replies and support.. mimi",

A couple of post-op pointers: bilateral Mx 11/7 I did colace daiy twice a day post-op and finally on post-op day 4 had results..very slow, painful process, and then the flood gates opened. Taking before surgery likley won't work as General anesthesia shuts down the bodies systems temporarily so either way, you will be starting post op fromscratch with whatever method you use. I stopped taking them now and just eat lots of fruit and fiber daily. As for activity, wow, be careful to not overdo it!!!! by Monday morning I was raising my arms over my head, washed my hair, moving well and with minimal pain, cut my vicodin in half..visited with grandkids here at our place, moved around alot..yikes..woke up with throbbing breasts like a vice around my chest, spasms. Lesson being, just because it feels like you can do it, don't. You will set yourself way back. I will spend the day resting to gain back my comfort and range of motion, slowly. hope this helps you gals :) Mimi",

As for fear, it's normal and healthy and part of grieving for what once was our invincible, healthy, vibrant super girl selves!!!! Let it come, ride it out but be strong and brave between those times. As a nurse its always been helpful for me to try to remember those patients who had way worse diagnosis, prognosis and situations that simply were worse than mine. It gives me strength and perspective Nd believe it or bot gratitude. Your attitude and positivity will enhance your ability to heal.

Please keep in mind a few htings, I just went through this 6 weeks ago. while it is fine to have \"complete trust in your MD\", blind faith is NOT ok, please research, educate yourself and advocate for yourself. Like it or not, we are being advised based on statitistics, but we ARE people., patients. I have been an  RN for twenty years and wish I had a dollar for every patient who told me after a reoccurence that they had been more aggressive from day 1 even if it was against the surgeons wishes. It is UNETHICAL,  according to AMA standards for a surgeon to show a strong bias while presenting the pros and cons of both OPTIONS to you. They are options because it is your decsion. Fact: The survival rate of both mastectomy and Lumpectomy with radiation may be the same BUT it does not tell you that the RISK of reoccurrence with Lumpectomy is MUCH higher and that those patients do in fact survive- at a lower rate than mastectomy though, after then having to undergo aggressive treatment like chemo, radiaion and yes a mastecomy. For me, preserving breast tissue for cancer to grow in, even  on my non cancer side, was a risk I was not willing to take with Grade 3 DCIS in all quads of ducts that mammo and U/S did not see because of my dense breasts. Even 6 months is time enough for DCIS to become IDC and perhaps metastisize. My Breast Surgeon, at a HUGE National Breast Center said to me at the first appt. \"you dont know how many women I try to talk out of Mastectomy\" My husband and i were stunned. The call from her a week later with my pathology results- she then said \"good call on your gut and going with Mastectomy, you were full of DCIS, I could not have done a lumpectomy. So, my dear, please rememeber, the medical community is very aware and dismayed and upset at what they call te HYSTERIA of the escalating rate of Mastectomy for even Stage 0 DCIS. They are not in favor of it and feel that it is taking us backwards medically. I DISAGREE. This is your body, your choice, please be comfortable making the decision best for you and how you will feel later, sleeping better, less anxiety about re-occurence..Nothing is perfect, there are no guarantees, but I like 1-2% risk vs. 8-12% with lumpectomy and radiation quoted to me by my surgeon. Good luck to you and many blessings and you go forward...Hindsight is 20/20 :) Mimi",
