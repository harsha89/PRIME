I feel so stupid asking this.  Anyway, I have had a recent breast exam 2 months ago which my doctor says was good and had had an ultrasound before that because I thought I felt a thickening which my doc thought was nothing, but sent me to ease my mind.  They ended up telling me it was my inframammary ridge.   Anyway, I would really appreciate if anyone who has had this would answer me to ease my mind.  I am sick and tired of worrying about getting BC so much.  I have a beautiful baby to take care of and all I do is worry and examine myself.  Partly because I see pink ribbons everywhere and the awareness campaigns are on the rise.  I am ALL about finding a cure, but sometimes these ads do something to me.
