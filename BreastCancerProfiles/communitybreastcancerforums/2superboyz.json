      "Content": "2superboyz wrote: Hi! Thank you for taking time to read this. I saw my OB/GYN today because I found a swollen area (upper outer quadrant) on my left breast. I am 39 years old. No family history. I am a little concerned because she saw exactly what I was referring to, but upon examing my breast couldn't say exactly \"what\" was swollen. She said she felt something below the suspect area...she said maybe a cyst. While keeping her fingers on my breast she then told me to sit up. I sat up and she said, \"No, that's not the same spot that's swollen.\" She said, \"You know maybe that's your ligament.\" Then she said, \"Or actually, that might be a lymph node.\" However, she said she wasn't concerned but would go on and order the mammogram and ultrasound. I'm more confused now than I was before I went in. Do lymph nodes just \"swell\" in your breast for minor reasons. She said, \"You know, it's like when you might have a hangnail on your toe, but your lymph node in your neck will swell!\" A swollen lymph node in a breast seems like a bigger deal than just something like a \" hangnail!\" Will lymph nodes swell with cysts? Any thoughts? Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",
