So similar, in fact, that it's uncanny. I am 42 years old and had a hysterectomy 4 years ago due to severe endometriosis. Due to the endo, I was never able to have children, so I have never breastfed. I woke up Monday morning with extreme pain in the right breast. There is a hard, thickened area (I hesitate to use the word \"lump\", but I guess it is) that extends from below the nipple to the right of the nipple. It is also hot and swollen. I went to the doctor on Wednesday and was diagnosed with mastitis and given antibiotics. I am scheduled for a mammogram on July 11 so that it will be done after the swelling and pain has subsided, hopefully. So, our situations are very similar and it would help my worrywart self if you keep me updated. Thanks!",
