That have never had breast cancer or any kind of cancer. Beside the one Aunt. So I think I should go for a mammogram in 6 months or so. My doctor didn't have time to explain to me what's going on with my breast. All they did was send my my appt instruction. And instructions on what to do if I die while they perform surgury. A hook wire surgury?lumpectomy?so I say no to it all. I stick with check ups every six months.",
