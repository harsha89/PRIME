I had my bilateral mastectomy in October 2014.  I told my surgeon that I did not want reconstruction surgery.  He, too, left a little something just in case I change my mind. I found that wearing compression bras and camisoles helped relieve the post-surgery soreness.  I still wear these today for bed and when I do yoga.  I find the prices on metromedical.com and thepinkbra.com to be more reasonable.  These sites usually have discounted prices. Best wishes to you.  Be happy.  Get well soon.",
