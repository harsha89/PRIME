    "Content": "Lsmith93 wrote: I am 18, nearly 19 and have just spotted a spot like red patch on the underside of my breast. I am worried about what it could mean and what to actually do. I have only moved away from my family about 5 weeks ago to go to university, so don't know people well enough to confide in them. Also, my mum is a nurse and my dad is also in healthcare, so if I tell them, they will begin to worry and they won't be able to do anything from miles away. Anybody have any advice on what I should do? Log in to post a reply",
