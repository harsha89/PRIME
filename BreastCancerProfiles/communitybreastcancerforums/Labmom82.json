Doc prescribed me some steroid cream to start using, not sure which kind as I haven't picked it up yet. He said use it twice daily. He also told me I could take my vitamin D3 my RA doc prescribed me so that is good news. Apparently once again, my test came back indicating I was extremely low which happens with RA sometimes. Best news ever though, he said I could use deodorant. LOL. The handout said not to but I asked him today if there was something I could use because hot flashes all day and no deodorant were not making me pleased. Menopause at 50 is so much fun. Well I am sure it is not fun at any age LOL. Salamandra. I have the stickers on top of the tattoos. One came off and they said no big deal and didn't put another on so I am like why I gotta have them at all? Easier for them to line it up they say. I was told the tattoos were to help if the stickers came off but more importantly, later on if they ever need to see where I had the radiation, the tattoos would show them. They didn't give me an option. I can relate when people hear you are just having radiation and not chemo they are like oh it is nothing you are fine. I also had really bad pain on my incisions. I had a hematoma under the incision where they took the nodes out. That has finally almost gone all the way down. I had pain for about 5 weeks and all the sudden boom it felt better. egregious, ask for hot cocoa, YES!!! And my regimen is 16 rads and 4 boosts, I asked today :)",

I tried to stay away from all types of groups because I am a worrier and I didn't want to add to the what ifs, etc. while waiting for endless test results. I started radiation treatment yesterday. I will have 20 treatments. No idea about dosage or anything, they don't say and I don't know what to ask. I just know that I fell into a category for qualified me for hypofractionated radiation. Doc said I could do internal radiation for 5 days twice a day, that was a no for me. I am a little behind in research, I just saw the rad doc for the first time last Wednesday, had planning Thursday and started yesterday. I was super busy last weekend and then I have had a really bad flare up this week of my Rhuematoid Arthritis, haven't been able to use my hands. Trying to figure out if I should be on a special diet (other than make sure I eat protein daily), etc. Right now exercise is out of the question. I have been off my RA meds for three months and the only thing I am on for it right now is the dreaded prednisone so I am flaring up for days at a time. Right now it is my hands, wrists and hip. Keeping my arms above my head for treatment is not helping with the shoulder flare ups either. I can only guess that will continue the entire time. How much water should I be drinking daily?",

A little darker and the skin feels tougher but not really any pain, minor discomfort. Doc gave me Mometasone steroid cream to use twice a day at visit 5. Hopefully it will do the trick. CHB87 and determinedat54, I too am having a lot of shoulder and neck pain. I have fibro and RA so being in that position is not helping. I am trying to work through radiation but am only working half days as it is just too much all day. I am also only working 4 days a week to try and help with fatigue. I am hoping I will be able to work the entire time since I only have 20 total treatments but we shall see. I can also work at home sometimes when needed. I have a great boss and have been with him for 22 years so I don't have to worry about taking off if I need to. Blessing for sure. But I am also the only one who can do my job so I feel bad if I can't get it done. What does everyone have planned to celebrate the end of treatment?",
