I had my exchange surgery yesterday, was so nervous something would go wrong. I love my PS, he is always happy and positive with a big smile (if I had his income, I'd be smiling too!) lol. Everything went well, about hour and a half surgery. I am VERY sore, bee sting feeling mixed with dull ache, and my back muscle hurts, almost like a pinched nerve in my neck. But I'm managing!! Thank goodness for pain pills. My TEs were filled to about 460 to 500 and my implants are Natrelle 410 highly cohesive anatomical, 560 cc, both sides. He also used LifeNet Health allograft \"skin\" from an organ donor. I've never heard of such a thing! They have given me a card if I wish to send a thank you to the family. I'm really not sure what this was used for, reinforcement at mammary fold to help act as a sling? Forgive my ignorance. I go back to work April 3. Mostly sedentary job except for carrying my steno machine to courtrooms (court reporter) and I can find a deputy or bailiff to do that! Molly, hope you are feeling better today! Scottiemom, Wallan (hope you get good news Thursday), 2Fun, Sitti, Lovepugs, and all the others on the March surgery board I missed, I wish you all speedy recovery! I don't think I will be walking much this week or lifting any weights LOL but maybe next week I will try some short walks. Hugs to all!! ",

I don't know what my bra/cup size will be at 560cc, but I am guessing I will be a D cup again. I am 5'7\" and 165 lbs. My PS said plan on at least ten days to recover so I took two weeks off. I think that will be about right for me and how I feel right now. I could have had my exchange surgery sooner, but ran out of sick time. Cdv , hope you can figure out a solution, sounds like you've got some good advice on here. Again, good luck and wish everyone speedy recovery!!",

Feel free to ask ANYTHING lol. Good luck with your upcoming surgery ‚ò∫Ô∏è Welcome BG46TN! I had never had surgery either, nothing! Talk about taking the plunge your first time. Go big or go home I guess. Geesh. I was so scared, what if I don't wake up, etc. Let me just say, anesthesia is a wonderful thing. You will wake up in what seems like seconds and not remember a thing. Now, the brain fog sucks. I think it took me a couple months to quit scaring my coworkers! They probably thought I had early onset dementia! But it went away. Molly, you have the strips on the incisions too? Is that just how they do it Nowadays? They scare me. I'm afraid they will come off too soon and my incisions will open up. But I think that is just me in worst case scenario mode that cancer seems to put your mind in. Let me know if yours get removed. Mine are still on. Took a shower yesterday!! Raven4, good luck, I'm hoping no infection this time around. I've never had one but I do worry about getting one. 2Fun, thanks, my CT will hopefully be in April. I'm calling my oncologist today and seeing if I can get it done before my visit with him on the 27th. Sounds like you have been through a lot of the scares with tests, scans, and you ended up having the \"bonus\" cancer. Ugh. My worst fear is they will tell me I'm in the extremely rare percentage of people who have dcis and get a freakin' met!!! It would be just my luck. But that's negative thinking so I'm trying to stay positive. Easier said than done as you are aware. Have a good day, everybody!",

I thought it was something gone horribly wrong, I was putting heat compresses on it lol. But it's perfectly normal with TEs. I'm so happy to have my soft squishes now lol! I also had a dog ear on right side where the cancer had been. It's still there but not near as bad as it was, 50% reduction. Looks fine in a bra. Good luck with the TEs, they are a pain but won't last forever üòâ Hugs Marie, sorry to hear about your margins! I hope you can get over the pecs if that is what you decide to do! Good luck to you.

Was in hospital 3 days. It has been 11 days since my surgery. My drains have been removed and I can shower with no problem. I can raise my arms up above my head but I can not take things off shelves or do any house cleaning other than maybe sweep the floor. I get tired easily so I rest a lot. My sister did my hair the first time I took a shower and now I am able to do it myself. Good luck",
