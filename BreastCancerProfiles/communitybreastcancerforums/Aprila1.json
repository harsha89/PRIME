      "Content": "Apr 17, 2018 07:52PM - edited Apr 17, 2018 07:55PM by Aprila1 Hi all. I'm also new here. Briefly (long) üòÅ history. At the time of my CA I was 36. I am now 38. I was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer back in May 2016. Early stage, Stage 1A. I found a lump in my left breast about 6 months later and had a mammogram done and they found the calcification in my right breast. Go figure üôÑ. They weren't going to biopsy the area but I demanded they do since I just got done having a radical hysterectomy for cancer. Well, glad I did because because they found the area in my breast to be Atypical Ductal Cell Hyperplasia. Well because of my Uterine Cancer my breast surgeon and oncologist had me do genetic testing/family history. The genetic counselor found that I'm at a 43.4% chance of getting breast cancerin my lifetime üò¨ My breast surgeon is recommending a Bilateral Mastectomy but Insurance will not cover reconstructive surgery which is $10,000 ü§î So a little over a year later my breast surgeon said I have to have a Lumpectomy. There has been little to no growth to this area. I am going into Surgery this Friday for a Lumpectomy. My question, finally is. Is it possible to have DCIS but with very little growth noted on a mammogram? I'm so scared it's going to be upgraded from ADH to DCIS   ",

I\u2019m going with the Lumpectomy first. My doctor said that ADH is very slow growing and may never turn into cancer, but because of my cancer history and finding it so soon after my cancer dx the dr wants it out. I\u2019ve also heard that the tumor could be encapsulating cancer. I\u2019m also going to out of work for 2 weeks which seems excessive. I\u2019m a Hospice Nurse so maybe that\u2019s why. So this Friday is the day. I go in to Radiology first for a wire placement (marker) then off to surgery. There\u2019s questions I forgot to ask the dr like how deep is the tumor, how big is the tumor and how big is the incision going to be. Ugh üòë I hate when I forget to ask questions.",
