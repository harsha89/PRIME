I will most likely be starting next week, although I don't have an exact date yet (might actually be August, but close enough, right!?!). I'm actually quite surprised to be here.... my surgeon never mentioned the possibility of chemo! After my surgery, she talked about hormone therapy, but that was it. I had an appointment with my oncologist 3 weeks post-op and when he started talking about the oncotype testing, my heart sank. I really thought I was out of the woods. I just got my test results on Monday, high intermediate, but he did make the recommendation for chemo. So, here I am! I don't know a lot yet, but that he wants to get me going very soon, since as of today, I am 5 weeks post-op. I'm not sure of the \"cocktail\", just that I will have a total of 4 treatments, 1 every 21 days. No port, we're going with an IV. I'm pretty anxious, but reading the August 2016 board has helped. I'm so glad to have this extra support. It will be nice to be able to reach out to others going through a similar journey. Hugs and prayers! Jen",
