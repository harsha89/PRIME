She had her first round of cytoxan/adriamyacin +neupogen 3 weeks ago, and is scheduled for her 2nd round of AC in 2 days, BUT she wants to quit!! She believes that poisoning her body further with chemo isn't a guarantee anyway that it won't come back, and has been depressed about being on chemo ever since the oncologist scheduled her for it.  Is there anyone who would say that she is doing the right thing to quit?? I have been adamantly telling her that reducing the risk of metastasis even by a little is worth going through the hell of chemo, (4 rounds of AC and 12 weeks of taxol) but I don't know how else to convince her. Any advice for or against continuing chemo given my mother's situation would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you so much, God bless. Log in to post a reply",
