I really had a feeling when they were saying cyst and draining it that they were in the wrong spot.  I even made a comment to the US tech that what I was feeling didn't look like what was on the screen.  Went back to the BS this month and she felt it, a resident dr. felt it - didn't show on ultrasound.  She did an excisional biopsy on Friday and took it out.  She says it's not cancer.  I see her again on Monday and will get my pathology report then to find out exactly what it was, but her eyes say it's benign!",
