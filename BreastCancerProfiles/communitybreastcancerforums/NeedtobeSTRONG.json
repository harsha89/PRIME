I will be having my part 2 of reconstruction on Aug 3rd. I was offered a great RN position within the agency I work for. I had just completed nursing school and had gotten my license a month before I was diagnosed so my career was on hold. I am so excited and extremely lucky this opportunity has been dropped on my lap. BUT I AM SO SCARED to move foward! The what if's...... But this is what I want so bad. It will help us get a bigger place and be more comfortable money wise. And I will be ale to gain great clinical nursing experience. I can not pass it p and have to give HR an answer tomorrow. Why am I so torn.....it has to be fear!

(was not for me) I may even got without a hat since the hair is coming in. But mostly nervous as this is the first big stepp back into life as I knew it. Hoping is goes well. I have gotten used to being a little laid back and not always on the go. Was enjoying my quiet cup of coffee after putting the kids on the bus.
