Yes, like they all tell us, it will grow back - and it will - it's hard to deal with. As far as the chemo - I sailed right through it and I hope you do also. It is very different today and trust me I was petrified - 100% a baby - but it was ok. I am scheduled for surgery on January 13th and I am not so scared of this.
