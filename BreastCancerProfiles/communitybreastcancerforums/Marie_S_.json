At a median time of 12 years post-RT (range, 2 to 24 years), 46 patients with left-sided and 36 patients with right-sided breast cancer (total, N = 82) had undergone cardiac stress testing. A statistically significant higher prevalence of stress test abnormalities was found among left (27 of 46; 59%) versus right-side irradiated patients (three of 36; 8%; P = .001). Furthermore, 19 of 27 of left-sided abnormalities (70%) were in the left anterior descending artery territory. Thirteen left-side irradiated patients also underwent cardiac catheterization revealing 12 of 13 with coronary stenoses (92%) and eight of 13 with coronary stenoses (62%) solely in the left anterior descending artery. Conclusion: Patients treated with left-sided radiation as a component of breast conservation have an increased risk of late, radiation-associated coronary damage. Treatment with modern radiation techniques may reduce the risk of cardiac injury.\" Log in to post a reply",
