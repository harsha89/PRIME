Thanks for the suggestion.  Yep, I am more paranoid than most about hospital germs.  I have a hospital-bourne MRSA-type pneumonia infection in my right lung.  Mask, gloves, and sanitizer are givens. ",

It looks like chemo will start 4/23 for me.  The oncologist has given me several options to choose from, and a few days to decide.  So I'm off to do some more research....",

So I thought maybe I'd survive this without too many issues.  Well # 3 was a week ago today, and I have been functional very little of that time.  Some days it's taken all I have to shuffle accross the room. After my afternoon nap, I woke up to realize that my mouth is starting to blister.  Badly.  In multiple places, including under the tongue. The oncologist and I agreed yesterday that I would have to stop treatments indefinitely (due to very stressful personal reasons), so I'm glad to have a break, but need to get this blistering under control.  I'm sure the stress is not helping at all.   I've tried gargling a lot with Biotene mouthwash, baking soda washes, salt water gargles, which were all suggested by the nurse practioner.  Now am \"holding\" ginger tea in my mouth.  The blisters feel like they may be spreading to netherregions.  I can only imagine how painful that would be.  The bottoms of my feet feel like they may have blisters coming up too, but none are visible yet.  I do drink lots of fluids (apx 60-70 ounces water per day).  Can you suggest anything else that I haven't tried?  ",

Is anyone else doing FEC?  I just couldn't do the Adriamycin in AC + T, so talked the onc into EC, which lead to FEC + T.  Since E is A's \"country cousin\", I'm curious if the sx will be any different.  Is anyone doing Avastin?  We've also discussed that, and will need to make some final decisions on Monday.  I got my port in Monday.  Man that sucker hurts!    Mine is right underwhere my shoulder belt on the seat belt sits.  Pillows make it majorly-painful. Today I took a friend to \"chemo class\" and to the wig shop with me.  I had picked out a bunch of wigs beforehand.  All of them looked horrible.  Like several of you have mentioned, I do not look good in short, straight hair.  My hair is naturally curly, and usually is down to mid-back length.  I had it cut a couple of days after diagnosis, so it's just past my shoulders now.  I had two 6-12 inch ponytails of my own hair, from prior haircuts, but a custom wig will cost $800-$1200, and take 6-8 weeks.  Chemo starts next Thursday, so no time for that now.  We're planning on letting the kids snip, and DH will buzz it when they are done.  I'm mostly planning on hats and scarves, anyway, but felt a need for a wig on some occassions.   I had blood work done Monday, while getting port inserted.  I already have low platelets and red blood cells, and my white blood cells are on the very low end of the normal range.  Given that, I'm afraid onc will say no dose-dense, when I meet with him on Monday.  I was SO looking forward to getting this show on the road, and over with soon. *sigh*  Every day's a new day....",
