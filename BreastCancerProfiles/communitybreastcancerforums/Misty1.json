How much will it hurt? I felt very little pain. How much will the lidocaine shots hurt, and how deep do they go? I am very small, and the lump was not very deep. How deep does the core needle (is that what it's called) go? same as other ? Do they insert the core needle more than once, and in more than one place? She makes a little cut for the core to go in, so if she put it in more than once, I did not feel it. Will it hurt when the lidocaine wears off? How much, compared to, say, dental work? I felt very little pain from it afterwards.  I went on with my normal day. Will I have a bandage over it, or just a bandaid? For how long? I kept the bandage on it for two days.  It looked like a little cut afterwards. Will it scar? I chose to have a mastectomy because they had to go back in to get rid of some DCIS from the original excisional biopsy.  So, that cut came off with some skin.  Please don't worry too much about the procedure, it wasn't that bad.  The nurses held my hand and made me feel better the entire time.  Speak up if you feel pain.",
