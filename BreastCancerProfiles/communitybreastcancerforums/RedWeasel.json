Although the pain and swelling makes your case quite a bit different than mine, I still wanted to suggest you look into one of the possible diagnoses for my lump - \"Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis\" (IGM for short).  IGM, as I understand it, often causes pain, redness, and swelling, as well as a hard lump, and tends to mimic cancer on diagnostic imaging.  It is technically an infection, but does not respond to antibiotics.  In my particular cases, on the ultrasounds and MRI images, my mass looks for all the world like cancer, but two separate biopsies have come back benign.  IGM is not common to say the least, but it may be something you want to \"google\". Good luck!!!",

I have no idea if this is your problem as well, but I wanted to let you know that I've experienced similar sensations, and only now have a better idea of what has caused it (nothing resembling cancer ).  Good luck and keep us updated!",

My doctor said that the staples will hold the sides of the skin together, and will be less likely to pull and deform the skin like stitches would.  The surface of the incision was never stitched - it was held tightly together with a ton of steri-strips, with stitching in the unseen layers of flesh underneath.  (I hope that makes sense) He never discussed the possibility of a drain, and seemed to indicate that the space filling with fluid was part of the healing process.  I really do trust him - he's a widely renowned breast specialist, and is actually on the editorial staff of the Journal of Surgical Oncology. I'm scheduled to go back for a follow-up next week, and to have the staples removed.  I'll discuss the drain concept with him, because the very thought of this happening again is very frightening to me.",

This morning, while at work, the seroma in my breast burst. I work as a caregiver for elderly clients, and the lady I was working with, an alzheimer's patient, became very panicked. Mostly, it was disgusting - my shirt and bra were drenched, and as I tried to wipe the disgusting fluid off her floor, more spilled down my belly. Yuck! I paged my dr, and he had me come up to the ambulatory surgery clinic, where he stapled the tiny gaps in my incision closed, put me on another dose of antibiotics, and sent me home, with instructions to rest for the weekend. Anyhow, has anyone else had a seroma burst like this? I'm a little afraid now of it happening again! I thought I was being gentle and careful and taking good care of myself...
