Struggling to find much useful but seems to be cancer cells in the lymph nodes in the right lung creating fluid so there is less air to breathe and seems to be a very aggressive form of lung mets. General bc history to date. Primary bc found Sept 2011. Inoperable so did neo-adjuvant FEC-T chemo. Didn't shrink enough so next step was rads and developed stage 4 skin mets at this time (May 2012). Did xeloda which gave me 6 months stability then switched to Navelbine. Ct scans showed pleural effusion in left side. Had pleurodesis but some fluid built up again and can't be easily drained as talc makes it collect in small pockets. Skin mets also restricting room for left lung to expand. Had to be admitted to hospital twice with breathing problems in last few weeks. Latest admission just over a week. On oxygen, steroids and low level opiates. Fluid drained from right lung. Started weekly taxol on Thursday, currently on letrozole too but not had enough time to tell if it's working. Hoping to get home Monday. Trying to move house next month to from 3rd to 1st floor so less stairs. Scared this could be last shot if can't get breathing under control.",

A clinical trial would be good but I'm not well enough to qualify. She has suggested another hormonal called Megace. I think this is on a nothing to lose basis.",

I've just given in and had mine shaved since it was starting to come out in handfuls on taxol. We managed to move house so I've been a bit busy to post lately. I had a bit of luck as the chemo unit screwed up my patient transport for chemo the day before we moved, so I ended up having chemo the day we moved and they picked me up from the old house saving me having to get down 3 flights of stairs by foot. Then they dropped me back at the new flat. I'm now only 1 flight up but am not yet up to walking out yet and am on oxygen so still rely on patient transport for hospital appointments. I'm currently back in hospital as my pleural effusions have built up again. I'm getting an ultrasound tomorrow to judge where the fluid can be drained from.",

I feel the good news is the skin mets haven't gotten any worse since I started taking it, bad news is I don't see any improvement. She said it was a slow-working drug and no further progress is fairly good at this stage. I'm still struggling with the nausea/acid reflux so she suggested taking both Omeprazole (the new drug this cycle) and Domperidone, which I stopped after 1st cycle. Feel I need to get this sorted out and have less tiredness before I could go back to work. Hands/feet not too bad yet but she expects them to get worse. Will see her again in 6 weeks. Might have developed a mild lymphoedema. I'm pretty pissed off about that as it was about the only positive I took from being diagnosed with secondaries before I had surgery and when I had rads they avoided doing the axillary lymph nodes to help prevent this. It's not much of a problem but I noticed it was a bit more difficult to remove my wedding and engagement ring and watch was a bit tight. Could be referred for physio if it gets worse. Also brought up the subject of surgery. I got the impression she wasn't overly enthusiastic but didn't rule it out if I can get the skin mets under control. Would probably risk further spreading just now. In any case I haven't made up my mind but wanted to check I still had the option.",
