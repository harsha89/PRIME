Thanks so much.  Montrial",

Estepp:  I, like you, was just diagnosed in June of this year.  I was in early stage with swelling over the 2 cm.  I have been in therapy with a certified lymphedema therapist since June 7th.  I was measured for my compression sleeve last Friday and will change from wrap to sleeve at my appointment this Friday.  My therapist originally told me I could wear the Jovi soft sleeve both day and night.  Thanks to this site (and it's wonderful participants) I became more educated regarding LE.  I was the one who told my therapist I could not wear the Jovi sleeve at night, but rather needed a special night sleeve.  I directed him to the step up-speak out site.  I feel he is a good and caring therapist for the massage, wrap, instruction, etc., but is lacking in overall knowledge.  He was just certified last year, though he has been treating LE patients for 8 years.  One of my concerns is he is not a \"fitter\" and does not know a \"fitter\" to recommend.  He measured my arm and ordered the Jovi soft sleeve for me, and he is the one who will check the fit.  I hope I am in \"good\" hands, because it sounds like the fit of these garments is especially important.  The Solaris custom fit garment sounds very nice and comfortable.  However, I have three dogs and I worry about them damaging the sleeve accidently with a paw/nail.  I noted they do not warranty against this type of damage.  Do you feel the material for the Solaris if fairly durable??  I, again like you, had noticed some slight swelling in my arm but was in denial and did not opt to go to a therapist until a visit with my oncologist who noticed the swelling and told me I needed to go for treatment.  Now, as I read more and more about LE, I am learning about the seriousness of the condition.  I want to do the appropriate things to keep it under control, but at the same time want to be sure the information I base my at home care on is \"sound\".  I wondered if I could wear a compression sleeve during the day and utilize a night sleeve only if I notice slight swelling.  My therapist says NO -- wear the night sleeve every night, so that is what I plan on doing.  I have not had any swelling in my hand, so I will be trying a sleeve without a gauntlet to see how it works.  To think I thought once I was through the chemo/surg/radiation with good results I would be \"home free\".  It seems there is always something.  Now I feel I am becoming paranoid:  someone sent me an email the other day with symptoms of ovarian cancer and I felt I have most of them.  I plan to wait and talk to my oncologist at my next recheck, which is in August, should they persist.  I do think doctors need to do more to inform their breast cancer patients of their risk for LE -- if mine had, I would have been more vigilant.  My prayers and best wishes for you all as you continue facing your own battles.  Meantime -- thanks a gain for being there for me.  Montrial",
