I did ask him for a copy of the report and he wants to see me in 6 weeks after going to the Oncologist. Just from reading this board I \"Think\" I may have what you refer to as LCIS. There was also mentioned in the report of \"atypical lobular hyperplasia\". The report reads like GREEK to me. Any input greatly appreciated. I can't believe I had to wait 2 weeks for this report!!!!",

So be sure to keep on TOP of your Blood Sugar's. I'm scheduled for a PBM March 17th. Right now I'm off the Diabetic meds totally, BUT having a heck of a time regulating my blood sugars. If I have anywheres from 20-25 carbs in a meal my blood sugar may go too high now. The main thing I can suggest is keeping a log/journal of foods you eat with the carbs listed and tesing your blood sugar BEFORE every meal and 1-2 hours from the first bite you eat. I have to track carbs, calories, proteins and sodium. Dorothy",
