There's never been any cancer in my family, I don't smoke, don't drink and never used drugs. The only slight risks I have are having my first child over the age of 31 and many years of oral contraceptive use. I'm seeking any info. I can get! My doctor said I need to have surgery as soon as possible! I meet with her in the morning. Tammy Dx 5/13/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
