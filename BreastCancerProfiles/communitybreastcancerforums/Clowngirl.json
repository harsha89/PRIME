Did you start cutting before chemo? Who did it for you.  I went and had a hair cut today and cut it about 3 inches shorter. My dresser says before I start chemo she will give me a radically short cut that I can spike. And then once the hair starts to go, she said she'd buzz it. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks,  Sally ",
