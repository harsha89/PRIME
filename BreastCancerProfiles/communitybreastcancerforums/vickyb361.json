Kate, I started doing that exact exercise on Monday. I have ugly pink flowered wall paper in my kitchen and I use the flowers to measure my progress! Kimberly, I know you'll be happy to get those drains out! You've had yours in longer than I did. I got mine out on day 8. It does help you feel more 'normal', if we can ever feel that way again! Beesie, I have had a couple of those shooting pains. Ouch! Right now I feel as if I will never get my arm up over my head, which I've been told I need to work towards for radiation. It feels locked up, but I will continue to climb my fingers up the wall until I get there! Vicky",

My drains and staples came out on the 14th and I began arm exercises (as much as I could) on Monday. My arm has been much more painful than my chest since surgery and today it hurts a lot. I'm assuming its because of the exercising but its even hurting all the way down to my wrist, which is new. There is no swelling or bruising, just pain. Is this normal?

They don't do tattoos where I go, so I have long magenta paint marks all over my chest and up my neck. It looks like a toddler drew on me and most of my shirts do not cover it all up. Oh well, it adds interest, right? Now I'm completely flat on one side (haven't bought a prosthesis yet), my hair is 1/2 in long and I have magenta paint marks for all the world to see and wonder about. I just think of it as WAR PAINT! When I first got marked, the techs used Tegaderm to cover the marks so the marker wouldn't rub off so easy. After two weeks of Tegaderm, my skin blistered under it. It seems I'm allergic to it. Hopefully the radiation won't keep the rash from healing. I hope everyone's treatments are going well. We can do this! So far its way better than chemo.",

      "Content": "Nov 27, 2008 02:56PM - edited Nov 28, 2008 11:00AM by vickyb361 Dear Missy, I'm so sorry you're having to go through all this especially on top of just having a baby which is a challenge enough on its own. I will be praying for you and your family. I know this is a very difficult road to travel. I'm glad to hear you have a wonderful support group. My breast cancer experience has been different from yours in some ways ( no bone or liver mets), but I did do chemo first like you are and then had a modified radical mastectomy followed by 33 radiation treatments. Its been a year since the end of chemo and will be a year next week since my surgery. The chemo did shrink the tumor (8cm) so well that it wasn't palpable by the end of the treatments. I have three daughters and my youngest was 10, almost 11 when I was diagnosed and started treatment. A few years before I had made her two older sister's quilts but had neglected to make her one. After my diagnosis all I could think was \"I have to get Anna's quilt made\" just in case. The thought of not being there for her as she grew into adulthood bothered me more than anything else. I'm praying the chemo kills every cancer cell in your body and quickly. What chemo drugs are you taking? Vicky",
