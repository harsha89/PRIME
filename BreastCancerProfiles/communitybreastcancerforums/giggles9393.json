I found a lump the other day, on my left side, kind of at the spot where its right between my breast and armpit. I went to my dr and they sent me for a mammo and ultrasound. The tech wouldnt do the mammo. He said I was too young, and the ultrasound made him guess it was a lymph node, BUT he wasnt 100% sure. No matter what I said, he was adament about not doing anymore testing.  I then went to a specialist who saw the first guy's notes. He did another ultrasound, then said he agrees with the guy. It would be pointless to do an MRI because of my age and that he is 85% sure its not cancer.  To me, thats 15% uncertanity, and thats too high. He said the only way to know for sure is if I get a biopsy, but that he wouldn't do one. He said all I can do is wait to see if it gets bigger. Yes, my chances are small because I am young and nursing, but I don't think that should subsitute for a real test. I just heard a story today about a girl my age finding out she had cancer, And another woman finding out she had cancer after her drs told her not to worry about the lump she found because she was nursing her child. I am also concerned because I went to the dr before all of this with a bad feeling because I found horizontal lines on my toenails, very obvious ones. After I searched it, I found out they are called Beau's lines and they usually happen if there is an infeciton or something in the body thats basically not right. Then, a couple weeks go by and I find this lump.  What would you do??? I am planning on seeing my OBGYN next week for a check up anyway, so I will ask her but any other advice is appreciated :) Log in to post a reply",

I was denied the mammo because of my age, and the ultrasound made them think it was a lymph node. However, when I asked how sure they were, he said he was 85% sure and Id have to monitor it to make sure it doenst get bigger. That's not good enough of an answer for me. My question is, did your lumps move? I am told that if you can move them, its a good sign. But did anyone have cancer and also have mobile lumps? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
