(was given a couple of extra time off during treatment to heal)  Did the RO tell you how many treatments?  The treatment itself only took about 15 minutes but sometimes they were running late and we would have to wait for up to 45 minutes. Some of the folks I had rads with had fatigue and others didn't.  Seems like the ones more active had less fatigue overall. Some worked thru their rads.",

I'm wondering if anyone is having back pains.  Laying on the metal table fpr rads is killing my back.  It hurts my lower back to lay on the table for a brief time when I first get in position; and I'm unable to get off the table following rads and have to be pulled up.  Now I'm getting painful knots in the connective tissue  in various places in my back after rads.  I have never previously had back pain.

When I asked, I was told I could use corn starch, which I did.  And I also brought some mineral deodorant that I read was okay.  If there is a difference, it's very minor.  But the glass is half full, as so far no major problems with skin breakdown.  Just getting more damaged with each rads.  Hope to make it to the end with skin intact and if i sweat and smell--so what.   ",

I received three little tattoo dots (likes little freckles).  Throughout rads, a big black X was placed on the upper part which was covered with a sticky dot tape for alignment purpose.  Also since I have had bilateral mastectomies, my scar was marked up in red and black markers covered by tape to designate the scar tissue areas to have radiation boosts.  I'm receiving my last rads today!!   33 of 33........  Now I getting the doctor to sign off today so i can participate in the YMCA free 12 week program for cancer patients (once the skin improves a bit).",
