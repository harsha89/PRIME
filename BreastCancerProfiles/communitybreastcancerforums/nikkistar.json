So far, so good. Keeping walking, got my nulasta shot yesterday, eating pretty well. I'm on emend and ativan and decedron and the whole cocktail. No nasuea. They tell me I will probably crash tomorrow when I'm off the steroids, so I'm trying to keep on top of things. THe one upside to changing to A/C is that it is only 8 weeks, That's like summer camp. A very lousy summer camp.  I wish everyone luck. xo, nikki ",

Just wanted to clear up what was posted - chemo can cause menopause, Tamoxifen does not. It can mimic menopause - hot flashes, sparse periods, but it will not take away your fertility. However, Tamox can cause birth defects, so you cannot safely get pregnant if you're taking it. Many women take it for two years, pause to have a child, and go back on. I did not go into menopause from chemo (4 rounds of AC). Certain chemos make it more likely, but it depends on dosage and your age. I did a round of IVF and froze 16 embryos before chemo, just in case. I'm very happy it did it, even though I did not lose my fertility. Most importantly, the overwhelming amount of biopsies do not reveal a cancer! Particularly in younger women - we have dense breasts that are subject to a lot of hormonal changes. If you have a family history, they are especially careful. Best of luck - remember, the odds are you are just fine!",
