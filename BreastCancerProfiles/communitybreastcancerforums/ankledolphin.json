I have a bunch already...but if there is one thing you wished you asked, would you be willing to share. So far my understanding with my treatment is going to be 12 months of herceptin, 4-6 months of chemo, then the lumpectomy, then 6 weeks of radiation..... thanks, :) beaverdiva.blogspot.com/ Dx 1/28/2015, IDC, Left, 3cm, Grade 3, 1/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 4/1/2015 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Targeted Therapy 4/1/2015 Perjeta (pertuzumab) Chemotherapy 4/1/2015 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

Since the doctor said it would be my choice, so unless this stupid thing spread into my lymph nodes, I am going to do a lumpectomy. Do you know what kind of tests they will do for the pre-op stuff? They plan on also doing all of that Monday so anything you can offer would be helpful!
