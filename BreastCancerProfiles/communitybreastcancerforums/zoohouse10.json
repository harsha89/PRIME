Pjkappel-  I too am working through the decision process of a Bilateral Mastectomy.  I am reading the Breast Reconstruction Guidebook.  Its a great book because is explains the process and all the options for reconstruction.  I bought my book from Amazon.com.  I am feeling more and more confident with my decision.  Its time to start making doctors appointments.  One of the hardest parts of making this decision is facing the recovery ahead after already going through the chemo.  I know exactly how you feel.  The more I think about it the more comfortable I come with it.  I have talked with a few ladies now regarding their experiences and they all have given me nothing but positive feedback.  I am a big chicken when it comes to surgeries so its tough putting yourself in that position voluntarily. So do your research and hang in there.  You will find your way through this maze and have a decision you will be comfortable with. Polly- hang in there.  your son will be back before you know it and you will be feeling better when he gets back.  Imagine how great that will be. Mary stay strong we are all praying for you.

I am her2+ so I am taking herceptin.  I have 6 chemo treatments of TCH ( taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin).  I take the hercepting with the chemo every 3 weeks.  Once I am done with my 6 treatments my herceptin continues on every 3 weeks for an entire year. I think the protocol for her2+ is a little different on the west coast then on the east coast.  Anyways that is what I am doing. Enjoy your evening. Diane",

Bettina: I have found my discomfort with my \"new cancer look\"  has gotten better with each passing day.  I do wear a wig to work and am feeling better about it each day.  I wear a hat around home and get alot of compliments on my hat (I wear the \"newsboy hat\").  Greytmom17: Welcome to your new look.  I hope you adjust well.  I can be difficult at first but hang in there, it gets better. Susie:  I am surprised your wig stayed on through the night.  I had my wig on the other day at the doctors office and he did a breast exam and when I laid back,  I felt my wig slip up.  Thank goodness it didn't totally slip off. So I had my 2nd treatment yesterday and still on my decatron high but that will end tonight and the neulasta shot this afternoon.  So my not so great days are ahead. For all of you struggling with your hair loss I wish you a couragous day.  You are all beautiful so stay strong.

Moral to the story: don't stop dying your hair.  Duh, you would think I could have figured that out. I just thought that all my hair would fall out so rapidly that I would be completely bald. So my questions are, will I go completely bald?  If so, how long does it take? If it takes a long time can I dye this very very very short hair I have left.   One more thing, if it takes a long time to come out, I would recommend a cute pixie for this phase.

The next day I totally fine (still on steriods), this is the day most get the neulasta shot. After you finish your steriods and you have the neulasta shot, things start to spiral downward on day 2.  By the 3rd day I felt like I had the flu.  Very achy and sore from my head to my toes. No appetite.  If you can, that is a good day to try to sleep through.  I also found a vanilla shake and chicken noodle soup were my go to meals.  I soaked in the bath tub.  Whatevery makes you feel good on that day.  After that you will feel better each and everyday.  From that point you will experience all kinds of various side effects from loss of appetite, taste buds...nothing tastes right...nothing, headaches, hair loss (starting around day 15). By the time you get to week 3, I felt great except for the hair loss part. Most of the side effects are not debilitating, just annoying and serve as a daily reminder of what your are going through.  Truly I was only down for the count 1 day.  My biggest fear was nausea and that was not a problem.  You doctor will give a perscription for that to help you out. Many of the side effects, the ladies on the board have experienced and will be happy to share their remedies. Good luck tomorrow.  The first treatment is scary but you will see, its not that bad.",

So I am enjoying not having to deal with that too.  As far as early menopause, I have not had any hot flashes, night sweats etc.  So I am enjoying the vacation from my period. My sisters results for their genetic testing came back.  They were both negative. and I find myself strangely sad.  Not because they are negative but because I am the only one that was positive.  So I find myself asking...why me???  I feel strangely alone.  So I am in the midst of my own pity party.  I guess I need to stop asking why and start making some tough decisions.  I guess I'm just having a tough day. So Gjlanders, it does matter that you are fine and alive.  So keep your head up because there will be hills and valleys that we all will go through. btw,  I was feeling down because of all this genetic stuff.  I guess who was in my neighborhood yesterday filming....Cesar Millan.  I was so excited to meet him.  Both my daughter and I got to take a picture with him.  So sometimes there are unexpected positves to help with all the negative. Anyways, enjoy your day. Diane",

Sorry your missing your son.  Its tough when the grow up and start moving in their own direction.  I wish him the best of luck and safety.  My son left for college 4 years ago.  He graduated in June and will be back at the end of August.  I am so looking forward to having him close by.  Watching them mature from teenagers to men at this point is so rewarding. Mary, you are a very strong.  Hang in there, I am so impressed with your courage.  You are an inspiration for all of us.  Take care and remain strong. Good luck to all of us going in for Chemo this week.  Hope it all goes well. Diane",

I too have gained weight.  I feel like I lose a few pounds the first week but then I put on the lbs when I feel better.  Its like I make up for what I missed while I was feeling so bad.  I would like to eat a healthy diet throughout but I find myself eating alot of \"comfort foods\" to make me feel better.  Oh well, once the chemo is over I can get back to a regular schedule with my regular life I will eat better. Wishing everyone strength and courage throughout the week. Diane",

I did my last chemo treatment on the 23rd so on Sunday when I crawled out of my hole I was so relieved that the worst was behind me.  Even though I am not 100% I was happy to know that I can start to put some of this behind me.  I have scheduled my bilateral mastectomy for 11/4 so I still have a big hurdle ahead of me but I am ready to face it. Tom thank you for your thoughts.  I wish you and your Diane the very best.  After 30 years of marriage you seem to have such a beautiful union.  You give us all something to strive for. Wishing everyone continued strength and courage. Diane",

I was trying to prepare for my bilateral mastectomy and so I just didn't have time to come on the board.  On 11/4 I had my mastectomy and all went well.  I am at home recovering for the next 3 weeks. Its nice to be home and not have anything to do but work on my recovery. Its been 9 days since surgery and I am feeling better and better each day.  I am pretty much off the pain killers.  I took one last night because I was really hurting.  I actually feel more uncomfortable from the swelling but even the swelling is starting to subside a bit. One thing I wanted to mention that I use and has helped me sleep is a neck rest (like the ones you use on an airplane.  I sleep propped up with a back rest and pillows.  The neck rest has helped to make me comfortable to sleep in this position.  I mention this because good sleep and rest is so important during recovery and this has helped me tremendously.  Just a tip for anyone going in to surgery. I continue getting my herceptin every 3 weeks and I haven't really noticed any side effects.  I think after the chemo the herceptin seems like a walk in the park. Anyways, I hope all if well with everyone. Diane ",
