They want to do chemo first. Followed by surgery and then radiation. I am er-/pr- but we are still waiting for my Her 2 results... I just they take awhile. They are also doing genic testing on me because I am so young and have no family history of ANY cancer (talk about shit luck). I have a \"team\" and I feel confident in them. The only thing I didn't like was they do not plan to do a Pet or MRI... They did more mammograms and ultrasounds but they don't think it has spread to my nodes so they feel that an MRI or pet is extra radiation I don't need.... And she said that it can course more worry then help. She said the chemo will be full body so if it's slipped out anywhere the chemo will get it...she said that is the advantage of starting with chemo early. They said I am stage 2 and they said I caught it early! That seems good right? I'm so scared but I feel like this is good news... Tumor is 2cm... They said that is on the line of being stage 1?",

I got into a trial for TNBC they are testing Cisplaitin and the 12 weekly Taxol. I got the Taxol.. Started last week... Of course 6 mins in I had a major allergic reaction.. I literally thought I was having a stroke :( they brought me back fast tho and I was able to make it through treatment... Ever since I've been having head issues tho... Things will be fine and then they get fuzzy or I get dizzy.. Then last night I had the worst headache of my life! Felt like it would explode... Now I'm terrified of having more chemo tomorrow... Plus I'm nervous about only getting the 12 weekly Taxols before surgery (I'll get AC and rad after). I know that I'm at Dana Farber and they know what they are doing but I'm scared. I mean you can't make a wrong decision when it comes to your life. The standard treatment would have been the AC 4x and then Taxol 4x dense dose... Part of me wanted to just do it but then my doctor said she was \"giving me tomorrow's treatment today\". It is so hard to just do what they say... I hate even leaving the cancer in my body! I was it out but they say chemo first... Ugh I hate this... :( I miss just relaxing with my baby... Now all I think about is cancer.. I cannot turn it off...",

I was told I would have rads and possibly more chemo after surgery because I am triple neg and they didn't expect a complete response to my first treatments. Then I surprised everyone and had a Pcr, no evidence of cancer in breast or nodes. The cancer never touched my nodes so now they are saying no rads. It's tough for me because it means my treatment is over but also relieving at the same time. I plan to get anothe opinion for peace of mind but I am at Dana-Farber and they've seen woman like me a million times... They know what's best. Good luck with surgery",

Ultrasound Earlier today showed no change :( it's stuck 2:1cm They said I'm only halfway through and since it's not growing they still consider this good. I feel like if it's not shrinking the tumor how they he'll is it killing the rooming cells in my body! Is it good that it's not bigger? Im scared... Could the cancer be spreading because this chemo is working right. My doc said might change to AC...Or surgery now or I can continue Taxol and have another U/S in 3 weeks.... I have no idea what to do :( Log in to post a reply",
