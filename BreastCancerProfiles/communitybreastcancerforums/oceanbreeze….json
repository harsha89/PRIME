Throughout the process I never fully was bald.  I did loss some smaller hairs after I shaved the first time but never all of it.  In the meantime it appears that peach fuzz is growing.  I can see spots where the hair isn't growing but everywhere else there is hair.  I had dark brown hair with high and low lights here and there that hid the grays I was getting as I get older.  Fyi..I am 39.  So do I let this peach fuzz go and just continue to let my hair keeping going or do I shave it all again right before or after my last treatment?  It's not very long but enough that my daughters like rubbing my head and say it's so fuzzy..lol.  Hoping as it grows back I see more brown again.  I still see brown in it now but just the longer hairs appear to be more white. Any advice or recommendations is greatly appreciated!  Thanks!",
