My nipple is tan and I have little holes around it, weird. My left breast is much pinker, tanner and sometime hotter that the other one. And when I have nipple alerts on, the left is much harder. Another question, when I go for my left side mammo, will they do the sqeeze thing or some other method and can you request the least painful one. I really dread the mammo. Thank you everyone! ",

They don't want you to use a razor because it may irritate the skin more during rads.  They also gave me a sample of the Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist, its available at Walmart, CVS, etc. Have wonderful day!",

My breast was getting red before rads, but the dr. was concerned, anyway, ended up going to have a biopsy done Friday, I was really bummed about it, tired of this crap, on and on it goes, but I made it and my best friend came to see me, my son and daughter in law came over too and we played poker and I felt better. I was on antibotics, it didn't help, hence the biopsy, but I did have a yeast infection over Christmas, was on antibotics for bladder infection, Merry Christmas to me. High tailed it to gyno cause it burned so much to pee, she gave me Aquaphor to apply and I got well. I don't know if this helps you, all I know is I didn't cry for 2 days and thats a record right now. I'm starting to have hot flashes too, night sweats also, but I've been drinking coffee the last few mornings too. I was on Effexor xr for depression and anxiety  before all this but my oncologist says effexor will help for hot flashes also. Also, stay away from ginsing, makes hot flashes worse. My arm hurts too, but my surgeon says its because the nerves are reconnecting after the surgery, its hurts in the back of my arm and on the side and down through my ring finger. I put a soft pillow under my arm and it helps, I also sleep with my arm laying on a regular pillow by my side. I am going to contact a local support group, they have one through the hospital and I need a comforting voice, I have put this off because I don't want to bother anyone, but I would help someone if I could in a minute and I guess others feel this way too. Your not alone in this tunnel, doe. Don't know if you like poker, but I play online free at party poker, look me up if you want, it definitly takes my mind off of all this. I'm pinkrozes. Hugs, Kajo",

I went for my second rad yesterday and go again this morning, then my appts. will be set for 2:15 daily. I asked about what to put on my breast to help. She said pure aloe vera w/o alcohol, can bring it with me and apply after my treatment. If anyone has the Coping magazine with Rudi Guiliani on the front, I was reading something about a web site to go to that the info is monitored by doctors or something like that, I didn't get to write it down, got called back. I'll look at it again today and post it, maybe it will help us. I really like that magazine, last month it had that lady on Desperate Housewives (if u watch) Karen, the neighbor whose house got hit by the tornado and trapped the kids, had lung cancer, who knew? It also had tips on organizing all the bills. NOW I need that. Thanks Rad Team, your wonderful, let's all stop and imagine our favorite flower(s). Mine are pink roses, and carnations. What are yours?",

Did lay there a long time, while the machine out of a movie went around me. She told me it would not touch me, and it didn't. Actually, while one piece went to the left another showed up on the right, which kinda startled me. She told me to tell her if I need to let me arms down and she would come and mark me, if I moved they would have to start all over.  ADVICE.. here. If your arms start to go numb (like mine did) ask for a break. I did not and I'm paying for it today. I was trying to get it over with. Went yesterday for 1st rad treatment, did not hurt, all women again. I think after the initial part of all this, things will get sorta normal. 2nd half of story. Breast is still red, and spot on side is not responding to antibotics, Dr. said to call surgeon, so I did yesterday, she had already left, so didn't hear back till just now. Which is fine except with me I go into mass hysteria if left to myself and the internet. I had myself thinking and diagnosed with IBC  (looks like little holes and looks like a orange skin underneath, although could be my stretch marks) and why call the surgeon if I don't need to be cut on again.?  It's like when the kids aren't home at 11:00, they are in a ditch and it is time to panic. Always prepare myself with a panic.  Dr. (surgeon) called just now, bless her, I like her, she said it is either cellulitis or lyphedema and is calling in another antibiotic (pennicilin), she has never seen IBS develop from the 1st cancer, it is a very low risk, but wants to see me next tuesday, will work me in, just in case and possibly take a sample to rule it out. Told me to stay off the internet, oops. You know I've got to look up cellulitis. My advice is to do that other p word, pray. God bless you all. Throw all those questions out there! Go Feb.Rad.Team.(FRT), well thats different! lol I feel better for now.",
