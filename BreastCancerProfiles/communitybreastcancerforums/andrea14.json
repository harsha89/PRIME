Same feelings as everyone else here: scared, wondering how I am going to feel, etc. I am not so worried about my hair and haven't decided what to do with it yet (wig, hats, ...) It is all so scary, I can't even sleep at night. Hugs to all. Andrea",

It is better now. I have a question, did anyone had their period start during treatment? Looks like I am starting mine even though is not really time. Not sure if I should be concerned about it or not. Thanks",
