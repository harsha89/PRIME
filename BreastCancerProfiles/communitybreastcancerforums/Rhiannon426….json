My husband is going with me to my appts and is very supportive. He is there to listen when I can't anymore. I'll have to find an uplifting cd to take for my MRI",

They tested positive for BRAC2 gene, I tested negative. Now I have a different type of breast cancer. I have chosen to have a bi-lateral mastectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection on both sides to double check if it has spread. My surgery is booked for April 16th. I am in a fog, one minute I am overwhelmed, the next I am ok with it. My mother did survive, but my sister passed.....how do I tell my mother?

I did get an IV put in so they could inject a dye for the end part of the MRI. I think the laying facedown makes it easier due to your face not being up against anything other than a face pillow. The only strange thing they did was they taped vitamin E capsules onto my nipples an where the cancer is. Next step surgery. That is next Thursday. Thank you all for your helpful advice and suggestions",

I do have claustrophobia so I'm not sure how well the MRI will go. The oncologist appt will hopefully give me more answers and give me a second opinion about what I should do. I guess I need to write a list of questions to take with me.",
