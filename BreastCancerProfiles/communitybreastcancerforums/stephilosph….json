After neo-adjuvant chemo, the lump has shrunk from around 2.8 cm to 1.8 cm, and the involved lymph node looks as normal as others. I'm glad chemo does do its job to shrink the lump and clear the node, but I'm still worried there actually might be some \"micromets\" in more than one nodes. I will see the breast surgeon next week, let's hope for the best.",

Another reason makes me opt for lumpectomy is I am negative for the genetic testing! Yay! However, my breasts are extremely dense and I know dense breasts have higher chance to develop BC. If recurrence happened to me I would really regret my decision! I am highly ER/PR+ and will turn 30 in 2 months. Please help me decide! Thanks",
