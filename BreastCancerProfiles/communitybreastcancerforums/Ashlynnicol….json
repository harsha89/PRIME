      "Content": "May 24, 2010 09:17AM Ashlynnicole88 wrote: The tightness that you are experiencing may be due to adhesions that formed during the healing process following your bilateral mastectomy. Adhesions are tiny fibrous bands that form following a trauma or surgery. These bands become like a thick glue that can restrict range of motion and cause pain and tightness, much like what you described as a \"tight band across (your) chest.\" There is a manual physical therapy called The Wurn Technique® that breaks up these adhesions, resulting in decreased pain and tightness and increased functionality. If you would like to receive more information about this treatment, visit www.clearpassge.com/adhesions/post-surgical-adhesion. I hope you find this information helpful.
