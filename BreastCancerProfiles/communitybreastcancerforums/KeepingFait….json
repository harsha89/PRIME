Ariom, what made you make your decision to not have the other breast taken off if you don't mind me asking? I have done it ton of research it's all I do while on bed rest and have read lumpectomy vs mastectomy.

I was 40 at dx in 2010, and received the worst news on my 43rd birthday in December 2012 - possible mets. This was confirmed on the 31/12/12 and I started xeloda / tykerb on the 1/1/2013. I am currently a Systems Analyst for an insurance company, and am looking to try something different. The stage IV diagnosis has me thinking I want to do work that makes my heart sing, so I am considering a range of options that will have me contribute positively to the community I live in. I am married to my best friend and the love of my life. I am the proud mummy of two young men who fill my heart with joy every day. The older one was born in October 1998 and my baby was born in July 2005. I want to see them grow into men, I want to share with them their major milestones and I want to spoil their children. I have always lived a healthy lifestyle abd feel bitterly ripped off by cancer. Pae xo",

I found the women on this forum helpful and genuinely caring. This has helped me find my way towards living again. It's taken me 5 weeks to add stage iv to my tag line, it still looks surreal. I was told that once I had a treatment plan, I would feel better. It's true! I started xeloda/tykerb on the 1/1/2013 and I feel better. I can breathe, the coughing is gone, the back pain has gone and I can sleep. More importantly, I feel better knowing that something is being done to rid my body of those awful lurgies.

I was 40 when diagnosed with stage 0 and was diagnosed with stage iv the day before my 43rd birthday. It saddens me that I could miss out on the milestones of my darling children (7 and 14). I come to this site often for support and advice, get as informed as I can and avoid statistics on prognosis. I also draw on advice from my best friend, who is also my husband. While crying over the future (over which I have little control) I could be missing out on the precious now. So now I try live in the moment and be present to the treasures in front of me. Prayer helps me as well. Sending you gentle hugs Pae xo",

I wouldnt have anything of them walk in my shoes for minute. I managed to get myself all upset and feel like I had to justify my every move and it didnt change a thing. I changed tact and decided to be me.  Every day I wear my prettiest and brightest dress, and greet them with a smile and the sunniest 'good morning' I can muster.  They don't know what to do with that response.  Buying into their negativity gave them what they wanted, and dragged me down.  Choosing to shine, regardless of my angst completely blows their minds (and doesnt have me compromise my values).

I spent my first few days in fear and anxious, feeling angry and ripped off. It wasn't good for me and it was not good for my family. I have chosen to wake with a thankful heart, and make the most of every day. I spend time with the people I cherish and look to do things that make my heart sing. I choose to spend my remaining days (and I expect many years), LIVING with joy. I followed the advice if the lovely ladies on this forum and sought counselling. I also started mediation and art classes at the local hospice. All have helped me to navigate my fears. I am in a much better headspace, focused on living more than dying. I hope, Renae, that you too will find your way to a less anxious space. Sending you gentle hugs wrapped in peaceful joy and light. Pae xo",

I was a D cup prior to having a mastectomy.  A mastectomy was recommended and I chose a bilateral (both came off). Getting through treatment was a priority for me and I chose to get a reconstruction 'later'. I was scheduled to discuss reconstruction options in November and had chosen to defer any extra surgery for another two years. After having a recurrence (November 2011) reconstruction is again not a priority for me. I wear foobs when I remember and have had to adjust my choice of dresses. I must admit that i really miss wearing strapless tops and tastfully low cut tops, but I manage. For me, living an extra day to see my husband and children is a highlight. One day I may have a reconstruction - but it is way down my list of priorities. I do miss my boobies sometimes.  However, I know that my boobs (although asthetically a positive) don't make me.  My beauty and attitude comes from within.  And although he misses them (he is a man after all), my husband loves me exactly as I am. I hope that helps : )",
