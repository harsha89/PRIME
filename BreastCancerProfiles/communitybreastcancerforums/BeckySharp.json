I am not sure if this is a correlation but it did worry me.  My BS did not think it would happen as I had SNB and mammosite radiation.  Anyway, I felt an achyness and heaviness in my arm.  It still looked okay but I called my BS office and his nurse obtained a referral for me in my area of a clinic who had certified LE specialists.  I was so sure they would say I did not have LE but I did want to find out about obtaining a compression garment for a flight I have coming up in June.  To my surprise I had Stage 1 LE.  She pointed out the signs to me (some swelling below my elbow, hardening of the skin, etc.)  Once she pointed it out I could see/feel it.  Anyway I go daily for a week, then 3Xs a week for at least three weeks.  They feel they can get me back to Stage 0 where I can do my own maintenance.  I am bandaged all of the way up my arm on m right side.  Very inconvenient but if it works I will do anything.  I have been given exercises to do twice a day plus how to do my own manual drainage.  I thought this cancer journey would be surgery, rads, tamox then go on my merry way with occasional checkups, but I see it is an ongoing never ending journey.  But it is good to be alive.  Thanks to all who warned that beginning signs can be aches and heaviness!  I would have ignored it until my next appointment if you had not.  Oh, and it's back to Weight Watchers I go.",

I did three times around dam yesterday am but the heat is just getting to me so I am moving it indoors.  I am going to the community center to do the walking/running track later.  I have been doing a minute on elliptical every 30 minutes while I do other sedentary work.  I had planned to do treadmill at home but decided I need to get out at least for a few minutes.

Carol--Have fun with your family.  I know company can stress so take it easy and keep chasing that little one for your exercise!  Soon you will have two!!  Even taking my Mom on these trips stresses me out because she is so slow now and her ankles were so swollen after last trip and she forgot to take her dieuretics.  Yet she won't let me check what she has packed to see if she has everything.  But I do cherish each day with her.  My 3 yr old great nephew is going with us so I will be running around with a little one too.  He loves running at the rest stops we make. Hope to get off to FL tomorrow but may have to wait a day due to storm.  I am repacking and will do a mix of treadmill and elliptical.   Sasone will probably be my partner at the beach. ",

I have also taken up some hiking in the Smoky Mountains which is quite challenging. I was urged by my LE therapist to do so and she has taken me on several hikes to get me going.  I do use trekking poles and it seems to help my arm and torso a lot. I do wear compression when exercising (well actually all of the time).  The poles I bought are REI brand but I am on a site called Hike the Smokies and most there recommend LEKI. They are expensive but more durable than less expensive.  Plus have spring support which is easier on arms.  I burn more calories when using poles and they really help out on less impact on the knees.  I think I would have sustained some falls if I had not had the poles to help me with balance while climbing up or down rocks.  bc101--Welcome!  You will learn a lot and find a lot of support here!

Carol-I have an Omron pedometer I got online from Walmart.  It counts steps/miles even if in your pocket.  The exercise science professor at my college recommended it.  I find the steps are accurate but I am not sure about the miles.  I calibrate it to my stride for miles but have never felt it is accurate.  I think my stride changes in different places which throws it off.  This pedometer even says it counts steps if in your purse!  I have not tried it.  I have frequently counted the steps off though and it does okay.  Also if I walk 10,000 steps it records close to 5 miles.  If I do some light jogging I would get less than 10,000 steps for 5 miles. Tina-At the dam there are 122 steps up (very steep).  There are two steps then about a four foot platform between each set of two.  I have to take a step on the platform between each two and a larger platform between  halfway up which takes about three or four steps.  I only go up them not down as I get leg cramps when I go down.  This started happening after starting tamoxifen.  Why not up and only down--go figure??  Doing 180 up and down in your house is great.  When you visit here we can go out to the dam if you have time.  Have done my first MLD today.  Am getting ready to do weights.  Then I will do one hour on the elliptical as I teach a class tonight and do not have time for the dam.  Then Lebeds and I can get ready to go to work.  Last MLD will be before bedtime.  I figure if I write this down here right now I am committed and cannot go back!  Everyone go kick some LE butt on this Ides of March!",

My pedometer is an Omron.  I got it from Walmart's online site.  Amazon also has it.  Mine is a older version and the walking style one.  Several say you can put it in a pocket and it will measure as mine does.  It has been quite accurate for me.  It records up to seven days of steps, miles, etc.  It clears at midnight for the next day's steps.  I have always read that we need to get at least 10,000 steps a day in for good health.  That is about five miles.  It can be steps you do normally at work, housecleaning, etc.  So I always try to get 10,000 on mine.  Some evenings I am going up and down the steps to my house or walking around to get those last few in.  Hope I can get to the dam tomorrow afternoon.  Too little exercise and too much good food!  Good weekend everyone!!",

Saw my therapist for measuring yesterday.  My right arm (dominant and affected) was smaller than my left in all places except right above the elbow in the back where the fibrosis is!  That part also had gone down considerably!  The jovipak has also been softening the fibrosis.  The great part is that my therapist had an off the shelf juzo for me to try on and it worked!  She is moving me from Class II Jobst to Class II juzo which she says is somewhat lighter.  Then the next sleeve move to Class I if I remain this low in volume.  Plus she added some more moves to my weight lifting with only one lb wts.  I think she was more jubilant than I was.  My right arm has never been smaller than left even before LE.  Maybe I should put my left arm in a garment and MLD it!  I still have a little swelling in the trunk on the side.  I have to wear a swell spot at night there. Well off to Dixie Stampede.  So much fun with a 3 yr old.   I did do 30 min on elliptical this am.  Am going out to dam tomorrow hopefully.

The nurse/coordinator called me to ask what should they feed us.  She has been ordering salty chips, iced brownies, sweet ice tea, heavy dressings, etc.  I recommended a vegetable tray and fruit.  The nutritionist who attends chided her last time on the food she had been serving us.  71 lb weight loss as of today!  I am going to do an hour on treadmill today as it is too hot again.  Plus weights.  MLD and Lebed already done. My left arm is one BIG bruise.  So I guess long sleeves today.  The vein in my foot blew also after they got the blood so a big bruise there.  Next time I will just slit my throat and let them collect that blood! As Hugz said just some kind of movement today everyone!",

Just do one minute more today than you did yesterday.  A trainer once said you can do anything for one minute (I could challenge him about that on some things!). ",

I completed five miles out at the dam yesterday.  The weather was perfect.  I have to work today so will do short times on the recumbent bike that is set up at my work site.  I am also presenting some of my  NLN findings at our support group meeting tomorrow so have to finish getting ready for that. ",

Purple--It may be late from your post but I am weighing in.  I was referred to a PT center that said they treated LE.  I was wrapped but only from right above elbow to hand.  No MLD, no skin care guidelines, and they did not \"do garments\".  After 2 months and reading about what should be happening with CDT on this site I got a referral to a PT Center that had Certified Lymphedema Therapists-LANA.  When I saw the new therapist on day one she told me I was still at Stage 2 and continued wrapping me 24/7 up to the armpit for a while longer.  I saw her three days a week and she did an hour each day of MLD on me.  Started me on an exercise program of mostly cardio at first.  With her doing the MLD and me doing it on myself daily plus the exercises was incredible.  We started in May last year and by October my measurements on my right arm were the same as my left.  I have continued to be compliant though.  She also recommended that I wear my sleeve and gauntlet (I started out with a glove) all day for at least a year plus I wear a jovipak at night.  I see her now for fittings only--every 4 months.  I am getting ready to wean myself off the day garments for a few hours at a time each day.  I still have some difficulty with truncal (Natsfan's story sounded like mine) but MLD and a huge soft spot at night helps tremendously.  Anyway a trained therapist makes all the difference in the world.  I do have to travel some to get to her but totally worth it.  I do wish all of us could have the proper care.  Oh, she did start me on light weights a year ago--1 lb at first.  Now I am doing the PAL program and am up to 10 lbs with no adverse side effects.  I have lost 80 lbs and she thinks that had a lot to do with my LE getting better.  Who knows what all works?  It is individual....",

I mentioned yesterday that I am up to 5 lb wts but worked up very slowly and only as prescribed by my therapist.  Started (only two exercises with wts, one with theraband) with no wt, then one lb and about every month and a half move up a lb.  Just don't want anyone jumping up to 5 lbs suddenly.  I am going to stay at that for awhile.  I only do three sets of 15 reps of the four exercises.

I am now officially tired.  Will have to report on the conference site later.  I am sure Carol has already posted.  Having a great time with my therapist here.  We sat together today and she was my medical dictionary!  That exercised my brain!   Dawne--wish I could be there to help you.  I am thinking about you.",

I have been busy with the local support group we have here plus my work teaching. PLUS exercising a lot. I did go to the Smoky Mountains on my Fall Break at the beginning of the month--with my sister. We did a lot of hiking for four days--one hike was pretty rugged. Weather was fantastic and the fall colors awesome. Funny story--my sister came over last Friday and we went to a local State Park-Panther Creek and got on a 2 1/2 mile moderately difficult trail. I have done this trail about 7 times since July with no problem. The leaves had all fallen and were covering the trail. We lost the trail and spent a long time wandering around hunting for a tree marker. I finally had to call the Visitor's Center and tell them we were lost! A ranger had to come in and rescue us! I did find out we were not the first ones to get lost on that trail last week. He pointed out a walking trail we could do and not get lost! So we logged about 4 easier miles on the trail he pointed out! We had snow showers yesterday so I have moved my exercise indoors. Hopefully it will be warm enough this weekend to get outside again. I am getting ready to do elliptical in a few minutes. Have already done MLD and Lebed. Weights were yesterday. Laural---I am late weighing in but CONGRATULATIONS! Becky",

My bike is in front of a TV to get my 90 yr old Mom to use so I have that entertainment. Emily and Tina--I started out Stage 2 LE in arm.  I don't know about trunk stage.  Anyway, I don't know if I am Stage 0 but my right arm (LE) is only 2% larger than left and slight volume only in upper arm.  I just know my therapist said that it is latent.  She did stress that I have LE and have to keep wearing compression garments night and day plus the MLD, exercises, etc.  After 20 more lbs I get to start going w/o night for once or twice a week then periods w/o day.  Says if I stay compliant I may be able to keep it this way but no guarantees.  I will do anything to try to keep out of wrapping!  Right now my right arm looks almost like my left. No puffiness.  I am getting ready to start exercising and house cleaning.  Hope everyone has a good active day!  Becky",

Yesterday I did not do anything except walk around a lot at work.  Luckily when I want to print something I have to walk a distance to the copy machine to get it.  I printed one thing at a time and walked a lot.  I always do MLD before bed and before putting on my night sleeve.  I used to do it also upon awakening but as I seem somewhat stable right now I am only doing it once.  I do the MLD exercises mid day as they can be done with the sleeve on.  I even do them at work.  Today I am working at home and will do treadmill and weights.  Plus a lot of cleaning.  I love to daydream and it is easy to do during MLD.  I listen to books on CD on treadmill and weights.  Sometimes I put on music during MLD. Carol- I could never make a six hour car trip without stopping.  I drink a lot of water on the way.  If I had not stopped when I came up to LE Summit the group would never have had bourbon truffles!  Plus I would not have let you pass up the ice cream store when hot outside!  I was wondering since you got pain from the sleeve if you are sure it fits correctly?  Maybe a custom would be better.  I think you are already CC1 compression right?  Just a thought.  Once I had a correctly fitting sleeve the ache went away.  As I lost weight and the sleeve became loose the achiness came back.  It would go away again when I would get a new custom sleeve to fit my shrinking arm. Tina--Way to go.  Can't wait until I get up there! Dawne--Wonder if the full MLD made a difference?  Does the water seem to help? Ohio--Let us know what you learn when you wade through the anatomy and physiology and give us a lay translation. Have a good movement day everyone!",

The PCP lab does not even consider my right arm.  Oh, and they put heat on the back of my hand before drawing.  My blood also drips out so slowly when they do get it that they keep having to shake the tube to make sure it does not clot.  So I understand all of your frustrations.  Binney gave you some great advice.  Don't worry excessively over it.",
