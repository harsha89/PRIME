Diagnosed in April w/ bilateral - after many tests, DCIS - right, stage 0; Invasive DCIS w/ 2 hot lymph nodes, stage 2.  Had lumpectomies. Just finished 4 rounds of epirubicin and taxotere.  With the anti-emetics these infusion sessions lasted five hours ! I had major nausea and a white tongue 3/4 infusions - not pleasant - but I survived.  Most of the time I felt okay - sometimes even really good !  I still feel like a toxic waste site ! This week I start navelbine - has anyone had that ? It's great to meet you all and read your stories !",

      "Content": "Oct 2, 2007 03:56PM - edited Oct 2, 2007 03:56PM by DivaAnna Hello  Portia ! I go for chemo every other week - that's called \"dense dose\" I guess.  I have a port so my veins are spared from a lot of poking - my blood is tested with a finger pick.  It seems the navelbine is going to be much less of a scena than the epirubicin and taxotare - but I am still curious: Has anyone had navelbine ???? Looking for some REAL information ! I had a WHITE tongue for 3 days after the ET - but that may be more from the dehydration I went through - I could not eat for a day and a half - after my neulasta shot.So, I would have chemo on Thursday -eat very little Thursday night, a piece of toast on Friday morning, maybe a little chix and then from Friaday night until Sunday morning - not much more than a bit of Gatorade, toast and maybe some cream of wheat.",
