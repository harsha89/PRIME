I've also been setting alarms to wake myself up at night to take the Zofran (which sucks) but that seems to be helping a lot too. The only major side effect now is that I'm just tired and sleep a lot. I don't think I'm eating enough but I'm doing pretty good with drinking fluids and for dinner just now I had a little soup with two whole pieces of mayonnaise toast!!

Everything was okay until a few hours after chemo when I decided to go buy dog food and a few cancer supplies with my aunt (see my earlier post about how I dropped the ball on preparation) Only got as far as the grocery store checkout line before I had to go sit down. I was able to walk to the car but we had to skip the pet store stop to buy the poor dog his food. I was super-hot and lightheaded and shaky, and felt like I could lay down and take a nap on the pavement, but didn't really feel like I would throw up. My aunt gave me a zofran she unearthed from her purse (she went through chemo in 2015) but that didn't seem to help. Back at home I parked myself in the bed and didn't move. Meanwhile, my mom and aunt compared their dosages and realized I was only taking half what they'd been given, so I took another zofran from my current prescription and after an hour or so I started feeling well enough to sit up. My aunt woke me up at 11:30pm to take another one, and then I woke up feeling sick at 3am and took one, and then another at 9am. Currently force feeding myself an english muffin. There's a ginormous neon orange Home Depot bucket sitting next to my bed in case I needed to barf but I never did, but the bucket looks hilarious. If I hadn't taken the mom/aunt approved second pill I probably would have thrown up. I probably should have taken one right after chemo but the nurse never mentioned it, and they'd already given me a different type, something called Emend? Does anybody else take that? I have to swallow another one this afternoon and then one more tomorrow. Then it's just me and zofran I guess. The VA does not have the fancy Neulasta dispenser thingy so I'm going to have my parents do the injection thing for me today too. I'm sad my port hurts so much! I was awake for the whole thing and it seemed like an awful lot of pulling and yanking and crap. (feeling blood run down my neck was fun too!!) It feels a lot better today but last night I could hardly sit up and lay down without it killing me. If it weren't for that I wouldn't be half bad now, but my dog needs walking and our neighborhood has a lot of rabbits and I'm worried he'll catch me off guard and yank my neck around trying to chase one. Sorry for the ramble-y post but how long did your infusions take? They did my AC one in literally about 15 minutes which seemed shockingly fast to me and made me wonder if that's why I got slammed with side effects all at once like that. The C drug they did first and that took longer, but I was still only there for maybe 2 hours tops. Never had any steroids, only Benadryl, which made me really lightheaded. Fun times! My dog seems concerned but the cats are like \"whatever lady, we still need our food\".",

I started this thread after reading other similar threads for people starting chemo in the same month, fully intending to make some virtual friends to talk to and share things with. But I as soon as I started chemo and started feeling crappy, I lost all desire to read or write anything at all related to cancer. I didn't log in to the site for a ridiculously long time and refused to read or watch anything about cancer. And once I did venture back on here, I mostly just skimmed or immediately left after finding the information I was looking for. Now I wish I could have stayed in the thread with you all, but at the time, I just couldn't. :( Anyway....so I finished all my treatment on time and without any complications. Chemo, surgery, radiation, etc. I had a lot of fun finally wearing neglected scarves from my collection and it was pretty cool when my formerly straight hair grew back in curly. Everything was fine until my oncologist put me on Lupron and Tamoxifen, which I feel like totally rewired my brain and not in a good way. One shot of Lupron was all I did because I was so miserable and didn't appear to be getting any better during the three months it lasted. But the tamoxifen was much more sneaky. I don't really have any of the physical symptoms people often get, it's all in my head. It makes me angry at everything and everyone, depressed, irritable, and now I can barely tolerate being touched when I used to be a snuggle bunny before. My oncologist reeeaeaaaaaalllllllyyyyy wants me to stay on it and gave tacit approval (barely, lol) to stop taking once in awhile if I feel like I need to. Sometimes I literally start to hate my pets, which is my cue to stop for a week or two or three. (I know the effects take a few months to fully clear out, but a shorter time definitely helps with the mood stuff) I also developed lymphodema on the surgery side, which so far comes and goes and seems to stay gone for longer when I exercise regularly, which is what my PT said the research is showing is the best way to fight it. I actually joined a Crossfit gym which has been really good. It's also good for getting me out of the house and forcing me to spend time around other humans. I had a scan last year that showed no signs of cancer, so yay for that. And my port was removed too. Another yay! Current projects include frequent pondering about what kind of tattoos to get to cover up my radiation blue dots, and whether to stop tamoxifen altogether in order to try to have a baby before I cross the Year 40 milestone. I'm turning 39 in September so I feel like it's now or never. My oncologist said she wanted me to stay on tamoxifen for at least a year first, and that year is up (ok, not counting the times I stopped taking it for mental health breaks, but still) So yeah. I don't know if I will continue to post on this site or not but I wanted to give you all an update! I didn't read through the entire thread but I did check out the last few pages. I'll probably spend more time on some of the other topical threads, so I hope I'll see you around! :) ",

I found another one! :) My VA hospital is large so other than my MRI (private hospital) and egg harvesting process (at a nearby military hospital) everything else has been done by the VA. The surgeon isn't there full-time but she works at another well-known, highly-respected local hospital so I'm feeling good about that. Not feeling so great about my VA hospital showing up in the news lately and people being fired for incompetence. The nice thing (if you can call it that) is that my mom and aunt have both also had breast cancer and so we've been able to compare what the VA is saying with what treatment they've had, and even pose general questions to their doctors. So far no discrepancies or weird stuff has come up, so overall I'm feeling comfortable with doing all this at the VA hospital, despite various friends and family freaking out a little bit because of the VA's not-so-great reputation!",
