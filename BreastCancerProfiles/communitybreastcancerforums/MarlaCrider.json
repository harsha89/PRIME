While everyone's treatment regimen will be unique, I believe the fear, anxiety, exhaustion, \"chemo brain,\" and emotional rollercoaster is the same for everyone. I hope my blog might help those who find themselves going through the same - and I welcome all the questions, comments and support I can get. Please see www.MarlaCrider.com and follow my Facebook too, if you wish, at www.facebook.com/whomeabreastc...
