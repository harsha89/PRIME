Had to have 1 back molar removed. The dentist was going to do a root canal and crown but saw that the wisdom tooth was coming in (at age 59 I'm finally getting some wisdom) so he went ahead and removed it. Then just 2 months later needed another root canal. I thought is was due to the lower white blood cell count that I was getting these infections but after reading all of this it may be due to the Xgeva. I was getting the shots every 4 weeks but now I'm at every 6 weeks.",

There are quite a few antibiotics you can't take because it could cause problems with the heart. I had one good doctor actually look up in a book what he could prescribe for a bladder infection. The dentist didn't want to take a chance so he was taking a chance I wouldn't get an infection after the root canal (luckily I didn't). Then one doctor that didn't pay attention and prescribed an antibiotics that after I looked it up I shouldn't have taken because of the Herceptin. So I guess it's just a risk if you take certain antibiotics you may have heart problems. My last Echo test was still good after being on Herceptin for over a year now so I guess it didn't do anything to me.",

Before this I went years without any dental problems. Is anyone else having this problem too? It's like someone just wants to heap one more thing on you to see how much you can take.

The last 2 in just the last 2 weeks due to the Rads Dr deciding to do a post surgery mammo and then finding more DCIS. Now after 2 more surgeries I was just informed me that they are not getting clear margins and I need a simple mastectomy instead of radiation. The nurse stated that it is still an outpatient procedure and I could go back to work in a couple of days and do breast reconstruction at a later date. Has anyone had a simple mastectomy and had breast reconstruction done? My first reaction was yes, let's just get the mastectomy over with. Now I'm not for sure if I will lose some of my options if I don't even talk to a plastic surgeon first. The nurse seem to think it would take months to first get insurance approval, then an appt and then if I want it at the same time to line up both Dr's schedules. I'm not even for sure if I want breast reconstruction because it seems like a lot more surgeries and time off work. I just so confused at this point and don't know what to do.

I too am wondering if they just cut over the same area or what will happen. My first surgery the cut was 5-1/2\" long. I was all geared for the rads treatment and now had to cancel all those appts and deal with surgery again. Sorry, I can't answer your question but good luck on your surgery tomorrow.",
