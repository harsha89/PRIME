I have been lotioning everyday. I completed my last dosage of chemotherapy on September 30th, had herceptin, perjeta, taxotere, and carboplatin. I felt tired the last month and a half and now I am regaining my energy, I was worried it was from radiation but I think it was from chemo effects.",

I think for me it was taxotere or carboplatin giving be diarrhea because I did not receive those two on my last treatment, just perjeta and herceptin and I was completely fine. I, too, lost about 10 lbs after each treatment that I worked to get back when I was feeling better. Hydration seems to be the struggle, how do you stay hydrated when you're vomiting and pooping everything! fluids at your center will be your best bet. my potassium has finally gotten to a decent level.",
