I am 65 years old and there is no history of breast cancer among my first degree relatives. I have never smoked. I am very athletic, have been a vegetarian all my adult life and had my two children young and nursed them, so this came as a shock to me. First I took a routine mammography and they found microcalcifications. Then I had to go in for a stereotaxic biopsy and I was diagnosed with ADH. Half of the doctors I spoke to said to have an excisional biopsy, to see if it is DCIS whilst the other half said it was not necessary, because the lesions are very small. I have subsequently decided not to have one done. The doctors in my country are opposed to Tamoxifen and other SERM drugs, whilst the doctors I have contacted in both Canada and the U.S. have encouraged me to take either Tamoxifen or Raloxifene, which is very confusing. I have been told that at my age I now have a 15% chance of getting breast cancer in my lifetime. I have been advised to just undergo \"watchful waiting\", which means to have a mammography every year and semi-annual exams. What experience have all of you had with Tamoxifen or Raloxifene? What is usually done in the U.S. for women in this situation? Thank you for your help. Lisabettina",

I wound up taking three sets of mammographies for my tiny microcalcifications, thus, being exposed to radiation three times. From what has been explained to me by American and Canadian doctors in the field, Tamoxifen or Raloxifene could bring the risk down. However, here in Switzerland they don't use these drugs for ADH, claiming they have too many side effects and they have refused to do an MRI on me, claiming it would show nothing. What is it that your surgeon wants you to do now? I know that doctors are starting to realize that \"a watch and wait\" approach is appropriate with low grade DCIS, so if ADH is below that, why should one need anything else? (Read about the Comet study in the U.S. and the LORD study in Europe). There is a lot of conflicting information around, even in the medical journals. I sent my mammography X-rays to different doctors and got different advice from each one. You might want to get the opinions of other doctors in the field. The fact that you have gone nine years without ensuing problems sounds positive to me. What surgeries have you had for ADH? I decided not to have an excisional biopsy for a variety of reasons, among them that my microcalcifications are very tiny and that I had a horrible reaction to the needle biopsy, from which I am still in pain, and I was backed by several doctors regarding this. I am afraid that I will fall ill from worrying about this! I wish I had never taken the initial mammography because I am losing sleep over this diagnosis.",
