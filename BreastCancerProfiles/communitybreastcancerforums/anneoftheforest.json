    "Content": "anneoftheforest wrote: I have become rather worried about developing LE so I thought I'd post my question here.  I had SLNB on both sides.  One lymph node removed from my right and three from my left. I am right handed. I was thinking of using my right arm for my draws and blood pressure since only one was removed and now I wonder if I should go with other places on my body. I feel guility/horrible for allowing the SLNB on my left prophalactic side especially since three came out instead of just one.  My DCIS with microinvasion on my right breast was not seen on mammogram but was found because I had bloody nipple discharge.   At the time I wanted to be sure there wasn't something lurking in the left breast that would require more lymph nodes coming out.  I guess hindsight is 20/20. How do you decide what to do? Should I see a LE specialist just for recommendations?
