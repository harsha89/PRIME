      "Content": "PastorRich wrote: My dear wife had her 3 year oncology checkup last week preceeded by a mammogram. The doc said \"the mammogram was fine, but....\" they wanted a compression mammogram and ultrasound. So that was today. With the ultrasound, the technician did the testing, then went to talk to the radiologist, then redid a spot (or two) again. No other details or comments except that we're now waiting for the report. I think this is not uncommon but it is very unnerving. Blessings to all, Rich  Log in to post a reply",

It didn't occur until later that we should have asked for more detail. He did say that if a biopsy was needed then we would see the surgeon who had done the previous one.... so we may have been in information overload... Thansk, Rich ",
