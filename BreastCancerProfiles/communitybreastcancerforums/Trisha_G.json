Leaving me as the only female family member who has not.  I went for an ultrasound of the lump but it came back negative for anything at all. I know its there I can feel it, and so can my Dr.  I have made a follow up app. at a the university of Penn. for July 1st. If stress could kill I would be dead by then! I am so afraid! My Dr. is taking a very laid back wait and see type approach that is making me even more crazy! How did all of you get through this \"waiting period\" and what should expect from my first app. w/ the bs? Log in to post a reply",

I went for my ultrasound that came back negative! ahhh! How is that even possible!!! Its certainly a lump and is easily found by anyone willing to feel it! So I am lucky enough to have great insurance and I am able to get a second opinion w/o needing a referal. I am also lucky to live near several great University hospitals! I just got my July 1st app. bumped up to tomorrow, I am crawling out of my skin I am so nervous!!!!!! I am part relieved to just get the app. over with but mostly just freaking out about the unknown! I would recommend to anyone going through this to get a 2nd opinion if you can.  Its your body not the Dr.'s and you are the one unable to put your mind at ease about it!  I believe a womans gut feeling is not something to be ignored!!! God bless you! Trisha",
