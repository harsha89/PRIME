It is right where my lumpectomey was.  Has anyone else experienced this?  What is the likelihood that it is more tumor vs. scar tissue?  I have a biopsy scheduled for Sept. 20 and then it will be 4-5 days before I know the results.  So long to wait... Thanks for any thoughts on this.  Dx 3/3/2011, ILC, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

You need and deserve peace of mind.  Wishing you the best!    DebRox - thanks!  I feel like I know you from reading your posts on the cold cap forum.  I hope we have this in common too and that it is only scar tissue. ",
