Guess it's just time to fasten my seat belt again, close my eyes, and hang on...feels like I have been reminding myself to do that for most of this year! Argh.",

Also, as anyone else with left sided disease been told to \"breathe shallowly\" for some of the fields? This seems easier said than done. During the mapping, I was told I was a \"big breather\"--I admit it, I do like breathing--but they don't want me to actually hold my breath. I think the beam stays on too long for that to work well for me...but I hope my breathing is shallow enough...whatever that may be. My RO does not seem concerned so I am trying to just let it go and not think too much about my poor, clueless heart. ",

      "Content": "Jan 21, 2019 11:57PM - edited Jan 21, 2019 11:58PM by naps Hi AliceKo, I'm in a similar boat in that I have decided I am not going to proceed with recon--I just do not want a major, long, flap surgery or more general anesthesia or the risk of a pain syndrome-- but I still have my tissue expander (and annoying saline port in). Ugh. I really think I am eventually going to go half flat, and I don't want to keep the TE in forever, but I am kind of dreading getting it out, and having a drain again, and adjusting to being half flat, so I keep putting it off. Plus even though the TE doesn't look great when I am undressed, it looks sort of ok under clothes and actually pretty good in a swimsuit. :) It took me a while, but over time I have adjusted to having the TE there, so I guess I will probably be able to adjust to not having anything on that side. And hopefully I will feel more comfortable once it's out. My DH has encouraged me to do what's best for me, and I don't think he will mind when I only have one. Anyway, just wanted to say that even though it's a somewhat different situation, in my own way I understand how it is to be on the fence about this kind of thing. And also that I think healing physically and emotionally can be a long process with many phases. If you're not feeling like making these decisions right now, could you defer them a bit until you feel more ready? Go easy on yourself. I wish you well. Hang in there. ",

Both PS I've seen strongly recommend a lat flap, and I just don't want all that. Plus, for symmetry I would need various things done on the other side...it's just too much. For me, the benefits don't justify the costs. When I initially decided to proceed with recon, I think I was in a damage control mode...how could I possibly make things seem \"normal\" again?! But I'm at a different stage now, more adjusted to the new (and changeable) normal, more accepting of my body however it is. Also, I have seen that DH really doesn't seem to care...he has tuned into the remaining breast (for my enjoyment). :) I wish I had gone half flat from the get-go, but I couldn't have known how I would end up feeling, and I made the decision that made sense to me at the time, influenced in part by some of my doctors. My female MO still doesn't really get why I'd go flat, but my female breast surgeon is quite supportive. I suppose if being half flat turns out to be a problem in some unforeseen way, I will cross that bridge when I come to it. There can be a lot of decision fatigue on this path! Right now, I am mainly trying to psych myself up to proceed with getting the TE out...I think the scales are starting to tip in that direction bc the TE is beginning to feel increasingly uncomfortable. Good luck to all!",
