Feb. of this year found a lump under my arm , right side same as lumpectomy. Decided to have double masectomy along with removal of nodes. Out of 15 nodes removed 12 were positive and two more cancers were found in breast. Pet scan showed a very small nodule on my lung and 2 in the chest wall cavity. Started chemo April 18th, I am so afraid of all of this. I am going to ask for all my pathology reports to get a better grip on whats going on. Too many unanswerd questions. Would love feedback from anyone. Thank you all for being here.",
