I spoke with a nurse and she told me that the new protocol is to do a needle biopsy first, and MRI then excisional. I noticed that lot of ladies on this forum had an excisional biopsy first. My radiologist is recommending excisional but can't find a center that offers this procedure. They want me to do a needle biopsy first.   Thank you   Log in to post a reply",

I am terrified. I'm glad I found this forum. I am falling apart. I hope they catch this early. My mammogram from last year was fine and I had an ultrasound on the same breast a year an a half ago and it showed nothing. I'm trying to schedule an excisional biopsy soon.   Thank you  ",

My ultrasound report says Birads 5 which pretty much tells me there's a malignancy. The radiologist is recommending excisional biopsy but the center my doctor is sending me to does not perform excisional biopsies only needle biopsies. I called the center and the lady I spoke with was trying to convince me that I'm better off with a needle biopsy first. I'm confused. There must be a reason why my ultrasound says excisional biopsy. Thanks for listening    ",
