      "Content": "Oct 17, 2014 04:20PM - edited Oct 18, 2014 06:25AM by ye74 Hi Sunkat1080, I wanted to tell you how the surgery went mainly because you will be having one soon so better to hear some good news. First I had the needle localization which was performed under local anesthesia and was not painful at all, they injected something first which did not feel that much and then put a needle and a fine wire to mark the lesion, this was guided by ultrasound. My BS also ordered mammogram views which I did not expect and got worried for a second because I thought it was going to be painful with the wire inside but surprisingly was not. Less painful than any other mammogram I had. I went into operating room right after and after meeting all people there I fell asleep and then the next thing I remember was waking up in the recovery room. When they asked me how strong the pain was my answer was zero :):):). I did not feel any pain right after and have not had so far. I thought it was because of anesthesia still in my body but no.. it's past 7:00 pm here, I left hospital around noon and still no pain at all.  No bruising or swelling as far as I can see. :) :) :). Again BS assured me we were doing this as precaution and that I would hear from her in a couple weeks or sooner once she gets the pathology report. I feel pretty optimistic now that everything will be OK and I hope you get the same feeling soon as well. We're doing the right thing is what you need to tell yourself. Best of luck for you.",

I'm scheduled to have my excisional biopsy this Friday 17th to remove a complex sclerosing lesion. I also googled and found 20%-30% upgrade rate but after talking to my BS, she said recent studies have shown 5%-10% only and the risk is very low in my case. Regardless I will be happy when that thing is out and if cancer I know it would have been found early and as many people said here .. highly curable. I hope everything goes well after your surgery. ",

I do not have ADH but I do have usual hyperplasia which I understand is a step before. They also found microcalcifications around the area. They want the area removed (apart from ruling out cancer) because it would be difficult for future screenings as I have busy breasts. I have fibrocystic breasts (lot of cysts and a fibroadenoma). I do not know if it's coincidence but I have been feeling a lot of pain in the same breast I will have the surgery, kind of sharp pain followed by strong burning sensation right in the area where my fibroadenoma is but away from the concerned lesion. I think this could be because of the stress and I have been trying to keep calm.  I know this is not an easy situation but keep optimistic and think we are doing the right thing getting whatever that lesion is removed and praying for a good outcome. I'm not really concerned about the surgery itself, maybe because I have not given it much thought. My core needle biopsy was really painful and it was not supposed to be. so hoping this next one to be better. Will be thinking of you and wishing good outcome for both. will post after my surgery.",

Hopefully you will be fine as well. As you I was worried before my surgery and I did a lot of research to be prepared just in case .. waiting is the worst part. My doctor always told me although there was a chance of hidden DCIS it was really low and she was doing the procedure just to be on the safe side. Good luck!",
