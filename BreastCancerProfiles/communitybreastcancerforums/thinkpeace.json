After walking around the hospital with the drains pinned to my gowns, I was happy to have them more securely attached. Now, ten days post surgery, I am pinning my one remaining drain to my shirt, but use the marsupial for showering, which I think is very helpful. Good luck to you. I was extremely nervous about the surgery and wanted to be prepared, but really, I didn't need anything.",
