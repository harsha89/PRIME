Seems very short for losing a body part. I had four rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxan that ended 6 weeks ago.  Severe CPIN and other problems caused the oncologist to decide not continue to the Taxol portion of my treatment.  I confess the \"Red Devil\" and Neulasta knocked me for a loop.  Am 55 years old, not exercising and very worried about how weak I feel as I do not feel recovered from Chemo.  My GI tract is messed up from throat on down.  Can't imagine managing drains the way I feel right now. Is there a presurgery soap to reduce the risk of infection?  Would appreciate if you know to post here or pm me. Am very concerned about PT and OT.  How on earth do you recover gracefully and regain the full use of your arm as quickly as possible?  Is it possible to have home health care?  Under what conditions? Would very much appreciate prayers for the surgeons, my family and me this Wednesday.
