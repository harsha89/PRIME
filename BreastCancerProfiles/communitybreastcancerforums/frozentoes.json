I believe that by not trying to recruit participants for clinical trials, physicians are creating a disservice to their current and future patients. Hopefully people can be exposed to these opportunities through social and support networks. I was lucky enough to chose my care to be done through a research medical facility so opportunities for clinical trials were more available. But I know that others are not so I will continue to help try to promote threads like this and educate people on their opportunities.",

The cancer, treatments (surgery, chemo, and rads! Not to mention meds), side effects, mental health, eating, and many other things. Chemo and radiation can be very hard on a person so try not to expect to bounce back right away. It will take time to return to normal. Some people are lucky enough to have experienced just a little bit of fatigue but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the \u201cnorm\u201d. Be patient with yourselves. It\u2019s ok to take time to continue resting. This fight is a marathon, not a sprint. Today was day 1 of AC. So far it\u2019s been pretty uneventful.

She said 27 hours after it was stuck to me so I\u2019ll find out tomorrow. I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m not in the middle of Target or something in case it takes me by surprise. Someone earlier mentioned frustration around food. I could not agree more! So I asked for an nutritionist with oncology experience. Luckily, my clinic has one. Pretty much the jist of what I learned is that I can still eat soy products but minimally, stick to lean proteins if I can, there is no need to eliminate citrus with the chemo I\u2019m getting, and to generally try to eat a balanced diet. As much as I\u2019d love a Bloody Mary right now, I\u2019ll just stick to water. Maybe in a couple of months....",

But worry is not going to help. Focus on the things that can help like taking care of yourself and preparing to get through this! You will be ok. Your cancer seems very similar to mine. When it was first found, the doctor said it was 2.5cm and there was a suspected lymph node. So they staged me at IIA. After a biopsy confirmed cancer in the lymph node and an ultrasound found a DCIS buddy next to the original mass, they sent me off to get a PET/CT. That ended up showing about 8 more lymph nodes including in the breastbone area and clavicle area so I was down graded to Stage IIIB. I told my oncologist I wasn't sure I wanted to see her anymore if she kept giving me bad news. This may sound scary but the good news is that the medical staff I am working with are doing their best to fully understand the full scope of my cancer so that they can best attack it. For me, the treatment is chemo first, then surgery, followed by radiation. The idea is that they want reduce or eliminate the cancer in the lymph nodes and the tumor first. So far, after 3 treatments, the tumor and original lymph node have shown reduction! Although, your chemo drugs may be different from mine, it sounds like they might be doing something similar. And don't be afraid to ask your doc questions. If their answers don't make sense, tell them to try again. You got this! ",

There are a lot of places that will use alternative methods still. Some people choose not to because tattoos are against their religion. I am also a bit nervous about radiation. More because my genetic testing came back with a variation of unknown significance on the ATM gene and the ATM is known to have problems with radiation. So far, no one seems concerned because it\u2019s a variation of unknown significance but to me that screams unknown risk. But I also have these pesky supraclavical lymph node and intramammary lymph node that need fried because they can\u2019t be surgically removed. So, a bit of a catch 22. I am a bit jealous of everyone that has their treatments spaced out over 2-3 weeks. This weekly taxol is really starting to beat me up. I\u2019m very happy it\u2019s nearing the end (8 of 12 done!) but then I start the AC portion. I\u2019m hoping having a week between infusions will give me some time to feel normal again. I\u2019ve also decided to take a leave from work. I was going to try and work through the whole process but I just feel like I\u2019m doing a disservice to my job and myself. Luckily my employer is extremely supportive which oddly enough feeds into my guilt. But it\u2019s the right move for me. And as if I\u2019m not just a bucket of sunshine already, I recently found out that my sister, who got her mammogram because of my diagnosis, has found out that she has breast cancer too. At first they thought it was just atypical ductal hyperplasia but after the excision and pathology they found DCIS. They believe they got it all so I am very hopeful that she will not have to experience the same thing I am. I am happy that she caught it as early as she did but sad that she has to deal with this at all. So far, my other 3 sisters have had clear results. Once I\u2019m cleared by my doctor, I am so taking a long vacation. :)",

It sucks and it's not fair and there are no clear answers because every single case is different, no matter how many doctors think they've seen 'your' cancer before. Node involvement is serious because it might lead to further cancer other places. THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT WILL. You can have anywhere from 15-30 lymph nodes on each side of your chest (it varies per person). There are different areas in the chest that the lymph nodes are. Chemotherapy is used for 3 main reasons: 1-reduce the size of the tumor in the breast, 2-reduce or eliminate cancer in lymph nodes, 3-eliminate rogue cancer cells in the body (as a precaution). Also, I am confused on why that study makes you sad. They stated that the sample size was small (94 ppl) and that they could not prove causality. What was not stated but I choose to focus on is that those 94 women, who after 6-7 years had no reoccurrence, may or may not have other health problems when they're older, but they will have the opportunity to get older. I know this won't work for everyone but try to remember that you are doing this because you want to live. Find that reason for living and focus on it! Don't let your worries steal the joy you can get from today. We are all paying the price for more tomorrows, be it wrestling with bowel issues or hair loss or muscle pains or worse. But there has got to be something that helps get you through it. Go ahead and learn about how to best fight your disease but don't let it consume you. Look for the stories of people who have struggled and over come their battles. Look for stories of people who help others. We will all have anger and sadness and confusion and this natural! Just don't let that be all. I believe that we will get through this. ",

It sounds like everyone is marching through the season as well as could be expected. I have to say, I loved the pictures of the red paw booties. I am so very glad I do not have to bring my cats outside. The temps have been hovering around 0 all week and I see people walking their dogs and I both question their sanity and commend their dedication to their fur babies. This was week 7 of 12 for Taxol. Aside from the crazy wait at the infusion center (almost 2 hour delay!) due to the holiday catch up, I've had almost no SEs. Or, I'm just getting so used to them that they feel like nothing. :D The big D was lurking around day 1 and 2 but I found my Imodium pretty quick and fought it off. I also had so much energy on day 2 that I dropped the kid off at her grandparents and I spent the day shopping for me! Today wasn't as energy filled but still good. After last week I was seriously dreading treatment but #7 has reminded me that it isn't always bad. Re: neuropathy - I have been taking B6 and B12 since just before week 1. I was already low on B12 and the doc suggested to get in the habit. I didn't start to feel symptoms until late into week 5. It was just off and on in a couple of finger tips and toes. Kind of numbness, more like feeling cold and not being able to warm up. It seems to affect my pinkies (both hands and feet) first and then comes in. So, I'm wondering if part of it is circulation. Luckily for me it seems to clear up and hasn't stuck around. I've also been told that it doesn't have to be just numbness or pins and needles, that neuropathy in feet can also feel like you have something stuck in your sock and you've been walking around on it but there isn't anything there. So, I have a question about the emotional side of chemo. I know we talk a lot about the physical side effects but there seem to be a lot of mental side effects too. How are you dealing with the emotional side of things? The stress? For me, I feel so damn lonely all the time. I have my husband and daughter but I don't see friends often. I'm afraid of becoming a burden to my family so I feel like I'm always putting on a strong front and it's exhausting. Everyone I know is very supportive and are always offering to help but I just can't seem to make myself ask. Tonight a friend brought over dinner for me and the family and it was so sweet and I am very, VERY grateful. But I am also feeling a bit saddened that I'm in this position. I've always been the caretaker. The fixer. Now, I need fixed and I hate it. If anything, this is a lesson in humility. Anyway, what's the hardest non-physical SE you've dealt with?",

We're going to do chemo first to try and shrink the primary tumor and it's little buddy. Hopefully it'll decrease the lymph node involvement too. The docs also suggested waiting for the genetic testing to come back before deciding on the surgery options. Getting my hair cut short wasn't too bad. I've had pixie cuts in the past so it's not new just not what I would have chosen if the circumstances were different. My 6yo requested that I keep a ponytail for her to keep so I did. I'm trying to find ways to help her cope with these changes without scaring her.

I don't think I'll have the same nurse for all of my infusions but if she's any indicator of the others, I'm in great hands. Using the port today for the first time was interesting. Once they were able to successfully access it, the whole process was super easy. The original nurse had a hard time finding the access point because there was still some swelling so it wasn't painless. Next time, I can use lidocaine to numb the area first. Which I will definitely be doing! rljess - I'm sorry your port placement did not go smoothly. When they were placing mine I could feel everything but the numbing agents they used kept the pain away. It wasn't comfortable but not painful. I told the surgeon that he might be a good surgeon but he was an awful masseuse. I used an ice pack off and on for about 4 days for the swelling. It helps with the pain too. Just be sure not to lift or push anything heavy. That includes the cart at Target! (I made that mistake) My port was placed Wednesday and by Monday I was feeling almost back to normal. Just like all of this, it takes time. I'm glad that my treatments are starting off with Taxol. It sounds like the AC side of things are heavier with SEs. At least I can pretend to ease myself into this. The premeds they gave me before the Taxol were benadryl, prednisone, compazine (i think, for nausea?), and pepcid. So, the benadryl ended up knocking me out for the actual Taxol drip. The grogginess lasted for quite a while. The nurse said once that wore off the prednisone could make me feel amped up a bit and so far that's true. So, sleeping tonight might be delayed. One thing that took me by surprise is that my sense of smell became super sensitive. I'm not sure if it's due to the benadryl and prednisone clearing up some sinus inflammation or the taxol. When I woke up from the benadryl cloud all I could smell was ramen soup and it was not pleasant. No one around me could smell it but the nurse went looking around the floor and found that someone on the other side had made some for lunch. Luckily, it didn't trigger any nausea, just an aversion to eating ramen anytime soon. I think my nutritionist wouldn't be too upset about that. :) Tomorrow is probably going to be when I feel lousy but that's ok. At least today was good! Also a note for any ladies with ports headed to their first treatments, be sure to wear low cut or v-neck shirts. It's just easier for the nurses to access your port.",

I\u2019m with you on the grieving of my past normal. I want it back so bad and it hurts knowing that it\u2019s not possible. Eventually I will embrace my new normal and get to the point that line between fades but right now it\u2019s still fresh. But, as they say, one day at a time. :) Hope99, I have been very lucky that I have had the pleasure of meeting and knowing a number of women that had BC and are surviving for a number of years. My brother in law\u2019s step mother is going on 25 years with no reoccurrence, a coworker was diagnosed when she was 39 and is now 17 years without reoccurrence, 3 friends from a former job are all survivors of 5, 7, and 10 years, a lady who works on the same floor I do was diagnosed and treated 12 years ago and she is still doing fine, my sister\u2019s day care provider has been stage 4 for 7 years but she is still going strong, the nurse at my daughter\u2019s school is a survivor of 5 yrs, and the lady I met through a support group is 15 years out without reoccurrence. I know my social circle isn\u2019t super large but I don\u2019t know anyone personally that has passed from breast cancer. Ok, so my treatments are getting harder each week but luckily next week is the last Taxol treatment. I\u2019m not sure what the next steps are because my MO wants to wait to see what the MRI looks like to make determination for the next phase. Since I\u2019m in the clinical trial, there may be different path depending on the tumor\u2019s response to treatment. So I guess I\u2019ll know more in a week or so. Being back in that unknown phase is a little hard but if my consolation prize is evidence that treatments are working, I guess it\u2019s a decent trade off. Finally, I wanted to share a few pictures of my after infusion treatment team. They\u2019re pretty awesome and I love them.  ",
