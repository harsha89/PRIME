So we set it up before my ct. However the report from the radiologist gives on ct is only talking about one. I just got the report today and haven't spoken to oncologist. Also I had a second opinion at Sloan Kettering in New York and the oncologist there recommended SIR spheres too. The two now confirm with each other on my treatments so I'll go with it....Praying your scans are GREAT. ",
