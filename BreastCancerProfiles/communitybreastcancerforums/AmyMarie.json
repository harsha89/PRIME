I am going to try and keep my composure about myself and not jump to conclusions about this lump. My husband told me that I was already talking like it was cancer and I haven't even been told I have cancer . I have never been one to look on the bright side of things but I need to start trying! I have been having thyroid problems for months and months which developed after my pregnancy and just recently right before I found this lump my thyroid began to swell again in my throat. I can feel that my thyroid is enlarged once again ...I made an appointment with my endocrinologist today for my thyroid going crazy again and it just happens to be the day after my mammogram and ultrasound. I hope I get some good news next week. Thanks ladies for being here to talk to me and offer me support!!",

It was pretty shocking to me  as I am sure it is to everyone. I wanted to think at first that it is probably nothing serious I mean after all ...I just had a baby 10 months ago and I breast feed him for a few weeks during which time my breast were swollen to an enormous size . Ever since having my baby I have felt my breast more than ever, feeling to see how the lovely stretch marks were fading away on my them which is how I found this lump. It worries me so badly and I haven't even gotten a diagnosis yet. I am scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound this coming tuesday though my doctor told me he thinks it will turn out to be nothing more than a fibroid. I am just not so convinced. It is a hard round lump right above my nipple and it doesn't hurt . It does however move under my fingers when I touch it , which is the only hope of it not being cancer that I am holding on to. I am so afraid and I just want to find out if it is bc or not. I want to know what stage it is and how to treat it or if I am absolutely fine. I am just so terrified for me and my family.
