I and a great friend both experienced the stress of a lifetime (very similar situations, near retirement so couldn't leave, and in comes boss from hell who seemed to be on drugs, couldn't keep anything straight, extreme corruption with nepotism, bullying, etc..) and the cancer developed and spread quickly over the exact period of the abuses/sickness/severe stress. A coworker also got sick. It was the type of stress that I never experienced before - usually can't lose a pound and lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks). The team of doctors demanded to know what was going on in my life at the time - they must see this all the time, when people are experiencing severe trauma. They said I needed to get out of the situation causing it. We all need to know how to manage severe stress (easier said than done), since anyone can find themselves in this situation. Diet of varied veggies can help, and exercise (maybe I should have tried yoga), and the garden or beach, and music - and getting out in nature - but very difficult to manage, more easily said than done, and the stress is magnified when you have kids depending on you.",

The doctor has to fill out a form since it is not yet on list of preferred drugs, and it has to be ordered from a specialty pharmacy. Hopefully this means other insurance companies will also start covering it soon. Don't give up, call again if you were refused!",

      "Content": "Feb 16, 2015 05:28PM - edited Feb 16, 2015 05:58PM by 3Holly Hi, I have the same questions about Ibrance (Palbociclib). I have tried letrozole alone, and faslodex (and did chemo when first diagnosed about 6 years ago - tamoxifin,etc.. I am considering a trial of 3 drugs including Faslodex, LEE011 and BYK719, but now that Ibrance has been approved, I wondered if I could try the Ibrance and letrozole without being in a trial. I already took letrozole alone, but it is the combo of the 2 drugs which is supposed to be effective (however, not sure if it would be approved if you already took tried letrozole alone, and then Faslodex alone). Also, Blue Cross says they don't cover Ibrance right now, does anyone know if they will, and for patients who already tried letrozole alone and faslodex alone? The big question is what will it cost to the patient? How does the Ibrance/letrozole (if even an option for someone in my situation) compare to the trial results for the 3 drugs mentioned above? I like the idea that the Ibrance is approved versus being the last slot in a trial since I'm thinking that being last means they would most likely be testing the highest doses on me. I don't want to waste my time thinking about Ibrance if it is not an option given what I've already taken, and also given the unaffordability if not covered.   ",

I have already been on letrozole and am considering stopping Faslodex and trying to figure out what to do next. Blue Cross is not covering Palbociclib as of now, though, and if it eventually does, it looks like the co-pay might be around 5000 a month? (so even with a co-pay card, there is a limit of 25,000 which would be used up in 5 mos. So it seems the cost would make the drug unavailable. My goal going forward is to have as much quality time with my family as possible, and not to be a burden on them or be in a situation where I am so drugged out I don't know people or in a situation where I can't even get to the bathroom on my own (to me that would not be living and would cause more suffering for all of us ). I do not want to put them in the poor house, either, since this disease has already cost us big time. I remember my uncle on his death bed worrying about cost of hospice, and I don't want that either. Given the side effects of the other treatments, Palbo (Ibrance) sounds appealing since it has the potential to give patients some quality time without significant side effects and (since FDA approved) without the additional stresses of being in a trial, with all the time commitments and tests, etc.. However, if it is unaffordable, I wonder what the realistic options are, if any, for what I am seeking at this point. Aromasin/exomestane paired with Everolimus has been suggested as the standard (but the side effects scare me) - it sounds like Palbo might be much better in terms of side effects if only it was affordable and available. I am at the point of wondering if the suffering would be better or worse by doing no treatment (since the cancer is in the bones and not curable) - at least I would not have to go for the tests, appointments, and have money stresses about the drugs which all add to the overall worries and take precious quality time away. Anyway, thank you so much for providing this info on Palbo/Ibrance, it does answer an important question for those who can get it and pay for it. I asked the FDA about this question, and they e-mailed me back saying it is approved as a \"single drug\", but that conflicts with the info out there that says it is only approved as a first line treatment - maybe they mean only as a first line treatment for breast cancer but as a single drug for other cancers? In any case this study seems to indicate it works even if not a \"first line treatment,\" not sure if this means it can be prescribed now if anyone could afford it. Thanks again for posting this!!!

I hope and pray that Palbo helps you and spares you from side effects. I also am praying that somehow it will become affordable and covered by insurance. Good Luck!",
