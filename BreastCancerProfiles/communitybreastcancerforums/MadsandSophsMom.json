      "Content": "MadsandSophsMom wrote: I had some genetic testing done for breast cancer and cancer in general and was negative for all. However, my family history (Mom's side: Grandma, Mom (x2), Maternal Aunt(x2) had breast cancer and died from it. Maternal Aunt had uterine cancer and died, cousin had ovarian cancer and one cousin had hodgkins lymphoma. Dad's side: Aunt and 2 great aunts died from and had breast caner and my uncle had prostate cancer), there is still enough concern that they have suggested a bilateral Prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction.I had my appointment with the breast care specialist yesterday. I think it went well. The doctor didn't have a definitive answer for me, which was disappointing. She said that she understands why I am considering this option and she went over two other options I have. 1. Do screenings every 6 months or 2. There is a pill therapy that you can get that reduces your cancer risk by about 50%. There are a lot of things that need to be considered. First, I have significant cancer on both sides of my family which is somewhat of an anomaly. This is one of the strongest family histories that she has seen. She said that just because I tested negative and so did mom for BRCA 1 & 2, there might be something genetically that we just haven't found or aren't testing for yet. She said that it would be an easy decision for her if anyone in our family had tested positive because since I tested negative, that would mean I'm not carrying that gene. Second, if I do the screenings, there is nothing preventative about that. It would just theoretically catch it sooner rather than later. She said that if I felt more comfortable, she would let me come to her and have my screenings reviewed by her rather than just the radiologist where I get my mammograms. If I do develop breast cancer, I have to have the surgery with chemo and radiation. Third, the pill therapy has side effects. It can send me into early menopause and I wouldn't be able to have any more children. With the double mastectomy, my risk of breast cancer would be almost nothing. I wouldn't have to do screenings anymore either. I would just have to keep an eye on things on the outside because that is where the changes would most likely occur. At the end of the appointment, we decided that I would meet with the plastic surgeon to get more information from her on reconstruction, healing and risks. I think I am leaning towards the surgery because it seems to be the best chance at not getting breast cancer. I know it will be rough and things will not be the same (body wise) afterwards, but I just think that I need to take the best chance at being here for the girls for as long as possible. As a side note, I was very close to my mom. Seeing her and my aunts go through cancer treatment was tough, but my mom's breast cancer metastasized into her bones and she died a very painful death. I feel like I will get breast cancer and it is just a matter of when and how soon we catch it. I would really like to hear from anyone with their thoughts on this.
