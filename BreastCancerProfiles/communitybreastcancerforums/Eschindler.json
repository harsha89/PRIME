I went to my primary, and then a gyn PA, and it turns out I have a rectocele. This is a LOVELY condition (just kidding) that happens as a result of extreme constipation/diarrhea and vaginal atrophy, which is part of menopause. So, now I'm waiting for an appointment with a uro-gynecologist to figure out how bad it is. There is a chance that my vaginal wall has ruptured, and that stool might be leaking through my vagina. Not kidding. You have no idea how much I hope this is not happening. I am 14 treatments into radiation, and I have no idea if there is a correlation between the symptoms I'm having and radiation. But, it could just be where radiation falls in the cancer treatment--post chemo, which for me, really messed with my digestive system. I am looking forward to being done with medical intervention, and now I might have to have surgery to fix this thing. Trying to stay positive, but feeling a little down about it.",

I am so, so hoping for an easy time with it. My doctor is also looking into adding carboplatin, because I'm BRCA1 positive. Anyone have any experience with that? Also- since this is my second time around, I just wanted to share for those finishing up that the protocol of once every three months is normal. I felt like it was super disorienting to just not be seen after going to the doctor so much, and I spent a bunch of time just following up on random health issues (there were a lot, because of surgeries, infections, etc.). I recommend a GREAT primary care doctor, perhaps one, like mine, who specializes in treating survivors. Also, my MO would just order scans when I asked her to do so, and actually, one of those scans is what caught this recurrence, which no one, not even the first radiologist, thought was cancer. Hope that's helpful! Hang in there, ladies. Almost done. ",

As far as the acne, I have also stepped up my moisturizing, and it's helping. I had a hysterectomy in 2015, and I was on estrogen because I was originally triple negative, but this last recurrence showed some estrogen receptivity (5%), so I had to go off of it.

After I kept having shortness of breath, dry cough, dizziness, increased pulse, plus UNBELIEVABLE FATIGUE this past weekly round of taxol, my hemoglobin came back at 8.1, and that was after my counts were rebounding. This means I was severely anemic. I had thought the symptoms were from a cold, but I was wrong. So, I had a blood transfusion today, and now I feel A WHOLE LOT BETTER. All of my symptoms are gone. I hope I feel even half this good throughout the weekend. I had a CT scan yesterday to rule out taxol-induced pneumonitis or a pulmonary embolism (I don't have them). I'm six treatments into Taxol, and two into carboplatin, after 4 dose dense AC. My docs said they were surprised I held out this long without my counts dipping like this, and that I shouldn't be surprised if I have to do a platelet transfusion in the coming weeks. I honestly don't mind because I feel so much better. I hope this info is useful for you ladies who are on the Taxol or far into chemo. Also, I'm thinking about those of you with the annoying SE. I haven't had the itchy hands and feet, but I have had neuropathy, which affects the same areas, and I have found CBD oil to be helpful there. I've gained a lot of weight, not all due to cancer treatment, but the steroids (I have to take 40 mg before each weekly Taxol, plus another 4mg per day on the weeks I get carboplatin, and I was on 8mg prior to each AC) really pack the weight on. I know Weight Watchers is in my future this summer. Amelia01- Are you on neulasta or granix? It helps with the neutropenia, which I ended up having during my first bout. Stay hopeful, folks!

I highly recommend facingourrisk.org, which is the website for FORCE, the org that helps people understand hereditary cancers of all types (not just BRCA). They have a conference every other year, and it's in October this year in San Diego (I think). Take heart if you have a genetic mutation: knowing mine has saved my life thus far, and it allowed me to plan for life without my breasts, ovaries, and uterus. I am one of the only women in my family who get to say they won't ever get ovarian cancer, which took the lives of my grandmother, aunt, and great aunt. And, because of my BRCA status, I have known to be hyper-vigilant not only for my primary cancer, but also for recurrence, which I caught while it was contained to a lymph node, and therefore still curable. I had triple negative cancer the first time. It is EXTREMELY UNUSUAL that I would catch a recurrence so early. So, genetic information, while there is a ton of grief associated with it (I won't go into the implications for my children), is vital and useful information. I am getting taxol # 9 of 11 in a few short hours. I'm awake on 40mg of dexamethasone, which wards off the dreaded reaction. They give me another 20mg of Dex, plus 150ml of Benadryl as pre-treatment. Looking forward to my benadryl nap! I've been severely anemic these past few weeks, and have needed two blood transfusions now, with perhaps another one coming after treatment. I get extreme shortness of breath and a high heart rate, plus diarrhea and extreme fatigue. I attribute this to the carboplatin, of which I have one more treatment next week. I am really just trying to hang on through these last treatments. My body feels so beat down. I wish you all the best as you round the home stretch on chemo treatments!!",

I have had allergic reactions to now four taxotere rounds (in 2015), and two Taxols. Today, I had my second Taxol, and I had to stop treatment because I had two separate allergic reactions. They had to give me 150ml of Benadryl, and 20 ml of IV dexamethasone, in addition to the 24mg I took as prep last night. My body was buzzing! And now, I'm miserable. I have terrible diarrhea, despite taking some Imodium, Norco, and some Valium (for the muscle spasms). I hardly got any of the Taxol, so I don't think it can be from that. I'm thinking it's from the Dex? I don't know. I've never had to stop treatment before, so I'm a little freaked out. Plus, when I was having the reactions, the Benadryl and Dex took a little longer to stop them than they have in the past. Anyhow, I'm going to talk with my doctor tomorrow to see what we can do. Also- as far as the fear of recurrence is concerned, having gone through both the experience of the fear, and of that fear coming true, my advice is to do your best to put it in a safe mental space using exercise and things that make you feel healthy (for example, I do occupational therapy, physical therapy, I run, I try to eat food that makes my body feel good, etc.). And, be vigilant and pushy with your doctors. If you have a weird physical thing that's bugging you, check it out. I found my recurrence because a random lymph node (in my chest, under my clavicle) lit up on a routine follow up PET/CT. Both my MO and the radiologist recommended just to follow up in the 3 months. But, I didn't feel great about that, and I had an ultrasound, which showed it looking much more suspicious. And, a biopsy confirmed the cancer. Because I caught it so early, it was 1 cm, surgically operable, and hadn't spread to any of the other 33 lymph nodes I had removed in the surgery. My prognosis is sooo much better because of that. So, that's my take on monitoring recurrence. Lastly, look for clinical trials that focus on monitoring for recurrence. They are developing tests that look for circulating tumor cells in the blood that show up much earlier than tumors would on a scan. I could use some good vibes. Today was a bad one. I hope you are keeping strong.",

So, I spent a year with only one side reconstructed, after which time I had what's called a lat flap reconstruction. This means they swung part of my latissimus muscle around onto my chest so they could place an expander underneath healthy tissue. That was in May 2016, and then I underwent expansion for about four months, finally switching out for permanent implants in Dec. 2016. During the time when I was not fully reconstructed, I wore prosthetics, and you really couldn't tell at all. Cut to now, I had a recurrence, and now I have to have rads (28) in the same area as my lat flap. I'm told the rads can cause the lat flap to shrink a bit, and affect the symmetry of my reconstruction. So, what might end up happening is after the rads are over, I will have my left implant replaced with a smaller one to match the one that's shrinking up. It won't ever be perfect- for me it's just important to be able to wear normal bras and shirts. I've learned to accept my naked body the way it is, three years later!",

It looks like I will be able to get the treatment moving forward. I'm three treatments in, nine Taxol and three Carboplatin left to go. Best of luck to all of you still in treatment, and congratulations to those of you who have finished. It's a big accomplishment!",

It's just inflammation in the lining of your lungs, but it can be fatal if it goes undiagnosed and it can also be permanent. Such a delight, eh? But again, it's really rare! As far as CBD, for neuropathy, I find the kind that has a little bit of THC in it most helpful, and it's just one dropper full with symptoms. If you go to a pharmacy that sells these things, you can usually get advice from the pharmacist there as well. Also, there's a website called leafly.com that has a lot of information about use. Re: the neutropenia, wear a mask in public, and gel in and out of everywhere, including places in your house. Also, there are special soaps (like hibiclens or others you buy at the hospital pharmacy) that really kill a lot of germs on your body. It's no fun to end up in the hospital being neutropenic, because the hospital is a germ factory, too! I start Rads in July. Not looking forward to that, but I am looking forward to the month off between chemo and rads so I can recover a bit. Wishing you best of luck, care, rest, and exercise!",

Since this is my second time around, I buzzed my hair like 3 weeks ago, and it still isn't falling out! This is odd because last time, I was completely bald by this time. Not complaining! It's just weird. Also having the port placed in the morning. Not looking forward to having it, but I am looking forward to speedier treatment days without an hour or two to find the IV specialist team to start my IV in my one good arm, which has had four previous rounds of chemo, as well as IV antibiotics. Anyhow- good luck to the rest of you with treatment this week! You can do it!",

The message boards on it here were really helpful! Regarding recurrence/Mets fears, I know they are persistent. And, I would seek help (whatever that looks like for you!) early and often to manage those anxieties. Otherwise, they can rule your life! After this long journey, you all deserve better than that. Best of luck with your next steps, ladies!",

I had several infections, and after trying to get antibiotics peripherally, and this after getting chemo (TC) peripherally, my veins were shot. So, I had a PICC line for one round of antibiotics, and then I had a midline for another. The midline was easier, but I don't know if it only works for antibiotics, or if you can also get chemo through one. It might be worth asking about. It sucks that your port isn't working! I am so grateful for mine after all of the shenanigans I've been through with different manors of delivery. Best of luck on this last treatment!!",

Has anyone else gotten sick while on chemo? I have a respiratory thing (lost my voice, bad cough, cold symptoms but no fever), and I've now gone through two weekly taxols with this going on. I'm really ready to not be sick on top of sick! I had a chest X-ray last week that didn't show anything abnormal, so that's a good thing. But, I have never been so tired in my life! Like can't get out of bed very much! So, I thought I'd see if anyone else has had this, and if so, did you end up taking antibiotics? Waiting it out? Six more treatments for me. Counting them down!!!",

You name it- I would get muscle spasms that would put me in bed for days, and once I had a migraine that caused me to lose my sight for like five minutes. I had fat necrosis, and rib pains, and neck spasms. None of those turned out to be my recurrence. But I spent a whole bunch of time thinking they were mets. So, I get it. But, here\u2019s what I learned: from symptom to scan to result is usually about two weeks for me. It somehow helped me to just think: I can handle anything for two weeks, and after that, we\u2019ll see. So, that\u2019s the thought process that made those times easier to handle, mentally. Expect your body to do weird things as it recovers from all this treatment. I am in a bit of a hole at the moment. I was too weak to get taxol on Thursday, because I\u2019ve been so anemic. I was disappointed, but not enough to extend my treatment past my June 7 deadline. My body is so beat down right now- I\u2019ve had two blood transfusions this week. It\u2019s so, so hard to be missing out on all the activities my kids are doing in the nice weather. I am like willing myself to be less tired. But perfect strangers are walking up to me in public and telling me they will pray for me, and everyone else is treating me like I\u2019m about to die, which I\u2019m not at all. Anyhow, it all makes me want to isolate myself, just to avoid these interactions. Anyone else feeling like this? I hope not for your sake! Happy long weekend, Americans!",
