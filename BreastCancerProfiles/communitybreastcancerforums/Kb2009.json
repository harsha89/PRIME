She asked if I\u2019ve always had it. I wasn\u2019t too sure. I called and requested an ultrasound. She decided to schedule a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. Could this mean she\u2019s expecting something worse? I\u2019m only 26 and I\u2019m very worried and scared Log in to post a reply",

But if the radiologist said it was ok for now, I\u2019ll just wait for the confirmation call giving me the all clear. Thank you all for the advice!",
