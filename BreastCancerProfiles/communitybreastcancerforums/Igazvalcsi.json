I have a breast cancer diagnostised this year in January and three weeks ago in the beginning of March i had a surgery, the doctor removed some part of my left breast, where were 2 separated tumors around 2cm size. Few days ago a received the result of the byopsy and one of the tumor is really aggressive, but the good news, that the tumor area and the 5pcs of removed lymph node test were negative. In Hunagary the usual way after this process always to start chemoteraphy like in any other cancer cases, but this is my biggest afraid. I always beleive, that in other part of the world, maybe doctors using other methods to minimaze the risks of tumor renunion, because im afraid, that the chemoteraphy will destroy my body. My tumor type is Ki67; 80% invaz√≠v carcinoma NST (M85003 Carcinoma ductale infiltrans C50) triple negative. Can you give me some advice or give a contact of a doctor in the United States, who can help me , which is the right theraphy in my case, because i would like to hear other opinion out of m Country. The Hungarian doctors saying Chemoteraphy is a must to prevent the further transposal. Many thanks and wish you all the best. Vali",
