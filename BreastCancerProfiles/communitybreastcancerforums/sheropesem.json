I posted a few days ago about a rather large lump right above where my port had been.  Yesterday I was in Vegas (we live an hour outside of Vegas) and I just had this gut feeling....I called my BS, said I was IN Vegas and could I come by? She said yes.....and so I went to her office. She did an ultrasound on the lump that I was HOPING was scar tissue. She got very serious and said I need a PET .....ASAP.  I was diagnosed stage 2a a year and a half ago. I did 12 rounds of Taxol, 4 rounds of FEC, dbl mast w/reconstruction and just made my exchange in April. She did say that it looks like lymph nodes.  I tried to tell her that I am really struggling. I have moments of pure terror and panic. I need some help. She gave me the name of a flipping psychiatrist.  I know she means well. I am so scared. I thought I was done. When I felt this bump I knew something wasn't right. I need hope. My poor kids are scared. Again. I am a Christian but sometimes wonder why it's so easy for me to have faith for others....but not myself.  Anyhow......happy 4th. Blessings and love and prayers....

Yesterday, when my BS recommended a psychiatrist, I was crying so hard in her office that I couldn't speak. I understand what she was thinking, but that's not what I needed. I just need good test results. I've been 'living the dream' for months. Clear margins last year, I have no side effects from the Tamoxifen, working like a crazy woman, enjoying my kids and traveling tons with my very athletic daughter. And then a stinking lump makes time stop and BANG everything is in slow motion again. So bless you....your encouraging words mean more than I can express. ",

You're also right about treatment....it's like a safety net and when it's over...it feels wonderful and wonderfully horrible all at once. ",

Then rads on right side, then a couple months ago had my implants put in and had my port removed. A couple of weeks ago I found a lump/bump...kinda large ABOVE my port removal site, right underneath my clavicle bone. Now....I KNOW I just had something done there. But I am sooooo darn scared! And I hate it!! Has anyone had this? Was it scar tissue? Tomorrow morning I have blood work, then next Thursday I see my oncologist for blood results. Do any of you FREAK OUT like I am? It's like my mind automatically goes to the worst possible place and then.....I'm frozen inside. Like the air is sucked out of me.  It's hard to laugh, hard to work, hard to focus. I really need some help here. Sorry to be so needy. Before I found this lump.....life was just grand....I was CANCER FREE and celebrating every day. I am praying someone out there has had scar tissue/bumps/lumps after port removal. Thank you in advance. I'm praying for all of us all the time. Hugs....
