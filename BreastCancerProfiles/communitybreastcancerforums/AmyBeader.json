It was supposed to be yesterday but the CT machine was down. So I had to have it today after my #7 Herceptin infusion. This was the first infusion without my DH and it was a tough day. Not that anything was that difficult, I just was not expecting them to take photos of me lying on my back with my arms above my head. And one of the techs was male. You would think it would no big deal after 2 babies and everything that comes with BC but I felt so exposed. Chemo was hard, but I'm really not looking forward to the next few weeks. I am hopeful that I will only have to have 21 treatments, but I won't know until next Tuesday when I have my simulation session (and get my third \"tattoo\"). They scheduled me for 33 treatments, saying it was easier to remove appointments than to add them. Still discouraging. I am feeling down tonight, but I know I should feel positive since I am done with the \"bad\" chemo. It's just really hard to feel positive when I still face radiation and Herceptin infusions until September. Plus my family wants to go to NYC for vacation over spring break, which will be 3 days after I finish radiation (if I only have to have 21 sessions). The idea sounds great, but I have no idea how my body will be by then, and it's really hard for me to feel excited. Also, for those of you with joint issues-I have been having trouble with my knees the last 2 weeks, and I am now 6 weeks PLC. I have a very hard time coming up out of a deep crouch. I think it must be lingering effects from the chemo, since I have not yet had radiation. Again, very discouraging. Thanks for listening-I feel like this is the only place I can post this. :( I had not been on the boards much because I was trying to forget for a while, but I am so glad you are all here!",

And, just like the sim and the ct, I was totally exposed on the table for the entire time. Not only that, but the station I went to to verify my name/birthdate and treatment area has video cameras of the treatment room, so anyone walking by the station can see what's going on in the treatment room. And, I have to walk past the men's dressing room/waiting area to get to the women's dressing room/waiting area. Clearly they are not too concerned for anyone's privacy. But everyone seems to think nothing of it, and they are all obviously focused on their jobs. I am surprised that they would treat through a thin blanket, because the tech today moved my gown down lower \"to keep it out of the field\". That made me think it could affect the beam. Oh well, I'm just not going to stress over it anymore! One down and 20 to go!",

I will keep it in mind to mention it to my RO if it continues to bother me. Brimton-yes-I feel left out and ignored as well sometimes. I know it is not intentional, but I do get the feeling that my husband is pretty tired of hearing about all of my aches and pains. I'm getting tired of it too! I have Aquaphor, Aloe Vera gel, Jeans Cream, Calendua, and a cooling towel, which came in handy last night for my hot flashes! Wish I'd gotten that sooner. Martini-I have gone through quite a bit of Zofran (ondansetron) with my chemo, and I learned to take a Colace with each dose. That really helped with the constipation. I refilled my prescription after my last round of chemo just in case. Glad I did, sounds like I might need it!",
