It's just the beginning; there are a lot of other factors that you will be learn about concerning the particular qualities of your tumor that will dictate what kind of treatment will be recommended for you. If you want to do some research, please seek out the most reliable sources: this one has extensive education topics on everything you can imagine, the Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Association; and avoid the lesser, more sensational, and less academically rigorous sites. Prepare for \"the rollercoaster\" we all go through emotionally: waiting for the test results that will guide your treatment plan. It's SO HARD, but we all go through it, and you can go through it here. This board is AWESOME. There is a topic for everything you are feeling (optimistic, scared, angry, grateful), for your specific diagnosis, the treatment you will undergo, and the very special STEAM ROOM FOR ANGER when you want to walk into a tunnel and scream until snot comes out of your nose. (It really helps!) People here are kind and understand. We get it. We support each other. You are welcome here! Carrie",

The emotional whallop of a diagnosis and the sometimes changing treatment plan comes and goes, and it is, from what I can tell, universal. If you feel like you are losing your shit sometimes, that's normal. (That's what the STEAM ROOM FOR ANGER board is for, too, BTW.) Cancer is not normal. I had klonopin for the day, and ambien for nights when I couldn't stop the cogs from spinning in distress. Get copies of everything; ask for copies after every appointment, after every test comes in. I got a binder and a hole punch, and started putting them in there. I also added handouts or other info from the hospital. Insurance correspondence, too. If you have copies, you can refer to test results later. Carrie",

I feel so fortunate that I was able to get my treatments at a stellar facility just a few miles away, and the doctors, nurses, and other staff were incredibly accommodating, kind, and helpful when I'd arrive yet again with a pile of paperwork I needed assistance with. This board has been SO helpful as well.... I could come here to ask questions, thrash, bitch, despair, cry. Besides the intense fatigue, I got hit with nausea and anorexia, which everyone told me (including the nutritionist) doesn't happen. So I imagined it??? Still not sure about the Tamoxifen issue. Going to give myself a few weeks to get my energy back. and then I will give it a trial. ((hugs)) to all who have completed their treatment, and those still in progress! Carrie",

I'm just putting some Neosporin on it until I can grab the nurse at the treatment facility tomorrow and ask her about it. My treatment breast is SO much larger than the other, it's noticeable even when I have clothes on. I'm amazed at how little I really knew about possible SEs of rads when I started. The fatigue just crashed onto me, too. Today, all I want to do is sleep! Carrie",
