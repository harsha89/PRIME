I had a biopsy marker put in but they told me right after when they do the mammogram to check on the marker that it had moved and it is not in the place it should have been. I barely started having the pain when I had my menstrual cycle on 11/6. So I called the nurse from the breast care where I had my surgery and she said for me to call my doctor after my period is over if I still had the pain because it could be an infection inside. So of course now I am on my 2nd day of antibiotics and the pain hasn't subsided at all. I have a feeling it is the biopsy maker too. What can be done about that? Anyone find out if this does cause infection inside just wandering around? Not feeling very happy. The biopsy itself didn't feel as painful as what I feel now. :(",
