They told me I should have results in a week. So now the wait.... Trying to relax today and then stay busy the rest of the time. What are some things you ladies did to help keep you from going crazy waiting for that call",

I am actually already on anti- anxiety meds because I have anxiety as it is but I am definitely going to ask about upping my dose. They gave me one Ativan pill to take before the biopsy- hopefully that we'll help me to relax during the procedure. I am trying to not assume cancer- but at the same I would rather prepare for the worst and hope for the best- that way I can be pleasantly surprised instead of in complete shock! Hopefully the waiting game afterwards won't be too bad. I've had 9 surgeries but I have to admit I am nervous about being awake during the biopsy",

It's starting to sink in that there might really be something wrong, and the wait is horrible. Is this also a symptom? I have been too nervous to google it- as my mind is running enough on its own.",
