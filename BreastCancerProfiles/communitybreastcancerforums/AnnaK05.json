It's hard, doesn't move, doesn't hurt, and after two years, I finally brought it up to my OB. She was very matter of fact and told me I needed a diagnostic US and mammo. I have to wait until Wednesday for the appointment and the wait is already difficult. I'm 30 years old, recently diagnosed with PCOS but otherwise healthy. What I can't stop obsessing over is I could have hadthis checked a couple years ago. What if all this time it has been spreading?? Log in to post a reply",

I requested my records and the imaging indicates a Birad score of 4B. Now I'm back to being very worried. Biopsy today took six samples of tissue and because the tumor is so deep, she had to work at it to get the right samples. I'm so sore and afraid",

How could that be when it feels like a rock under my skin?? They called me back for more pictures and found a good size area of concern on my left breast. So nowI need an ultrasound guided biopsy which I'll have to wait a week or so to schedule",
