I watched my wife slowly losing weight and having abdominal symptoms after about 4 months Since there was really no response and then her liver enzymes went up for the first time she got 2 doses of Hallavan and ended up jaundiced and in full blown liver failure She was hospitalized for 5 days and the liver fully recovered and we went to Memorial Sloan in NY and started xeloda She is gaining weight and all liver enzymes and bili are normal so for now we will await upcoming scans I find that oncologists have a very tough job but the art of medicine is to match the patient with the best drugs and individualize their treatment Many of them are either too busy or too regimented to change ... that's why a second or third look at your individual situation is warranted To some docs patients are a burden and they are not very compassionate and warm ... they have a difficult job but if you need more .. look around ... because at the end of the day they are not operating on you rather prescribing toxic drugs that really needs to watched closely ... and any oncologist can write the script but the good ones will do it and do their best to individualize it taking into account quality of life and side affects and pick up complications early The great oncologists do it with compassion and caring but I'm afraid that in their world they protect themselves in such a difficult world ...it's a tough field For example , as some know xeloda is routinely 2 weeks on and one off The studies have shown 7 days on and 7 off are comparable with fewer severe side affects Then there is the dosing and how much to push a patient, and that in my opinion is the art of medicine. When looking for a second opinion you want the truth but you also want quality and quantity when at all possible You want hope , but not false hope and you want compassion for you and your family The other aspect of a second opinion and major cancer center is an oncologist who can fight to get you approved for clinical trials and they sometimes have more studies in their institutions It's like having a coach fighting for you, so if you don't feel as if you are having that doctor or medical team behind you.... see what else is available Wishing all a 2017 with hope and new therapies for all I hope this helps .. sorry for carrying on a little long  ",

So not sure if the insurance companies will cover it and whether an oncologist recommends just using that treatment alone without chemo is standard care That was why I was curious if purple was only on immunotherapy .. What drug was being used ? Perhaps that is a separate trial of immunotherapy alone Unfortunately there is hair loss with abraxane , but the other side affects are more manageable .. Biggest is fatigue No pre meds needed and counts have stayed pretty good One of the benefits I have been told is that if you are on the trial and the drug gets approved and the study gets unblinded you can be a candidate for \"compassionate care\" and be one of the first to get drug if you were getting placebo Hope this helps ",

This disease, as many progressive diseases is a battle that affects the physical body and the mental spirit The days my wife feels well and the scans are good we try to enjoy , but as we all learn unfortunately there are ups and downs , and having support for both these times is so important I write this post to share our experience and to give hope to all you brave fighters As I mentioned previously , I am a urologist and I have had the privilege of taking care of thousands of patients with various different cancers Now it has hit home and personal But I want to share what we went through and continued to go through You see my wife was stage 1 , 1.8 centimeter triple negative and she decided to do bilateral latissimus grafts and did very well I asked about scans and was told 4 cycles of TC is all that is needed \"Insurance doesn't cove scans for stage 1\" A year later severe fatigue ,and then a CT showed 2 liver lesions The journey resumed and we chose to enroll on the abraxane //pdl1 trial To this day we don't know if she received the pdl1 but the the tumors responded for 9 months and then came back in the same place We changed to doxil for 4 months and had no significant response but the markers went up a bit so we started Eribulin When we stated Eribulin the liver enzymes for the first time were elevated likely from the doxil ,and likely that the Eribulin really kicked the hell out of the liver and she became jaundiced During this time amazingly , the week when the liver was just starting to fail our last child ( we have 4) was married and we had our first grandson born to our daughter The timing was crazy , but we loved every minute of the wedding and 2 days later she was sick and hospitalized for 5 days We were very scared this was an obstruction and thankfully it was not She had all kinds of scans and an ERCP which shwed no blockage The liver is recovering slowly and we made an appointment at memorial and met with dr norton and others ,and they are working on new drugs for triple negative They also took blood for DNA testing and really gave us hope Likely she will start xeloda and their protocol is a little different than most to minimize toxicity I write theirs to give hope , always seek more than one opinion, and when the good times come embrace them as much as you can We can only hope and pray that all the money and effort going in to finding a cure really does find one  ",

Just my professional opinion Feel free to message me and we can speak on the phone If my wife is on the trial drug , which we think she is , there has been dramatic response ...-and my hope is others are getting great responses they should fast track this to patients with TN and get it approved Hope this helps",
