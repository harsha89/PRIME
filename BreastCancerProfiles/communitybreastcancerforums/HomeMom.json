Rotating your shoulders back x 10 then forward x 10. They say to use a yard stick and rotate from side to side x 5 or 10. I usually do 10.

I have not confirmed it with my BS but I had 2 nodes positive after my lumpectomy and then decided to do the mastectomy due to dirty margins. They found one more but also said another one has small \"specs\" in it and they don't usually count those. My BS likes to make written notes and I thought I saw IIIa on something. So I really don't know if I had 4 or 3 nodes that could be considered positive.   Kind of like your horoscope - I'm on the cusp? Jenn I did the same thing. I saw my breast was flat in one spot below my nipple. I looked and there was actually a mole there that was horizontal. It was flesh colored and I thought it was strange. I did feel a small lump so I called my GYN and couldn't get in for a few months (3 I think). When I went she felt it and said it was fibroidcystic.  I thought ok, and promptly didn't get the mammogram. Two years later I went back!  For all I know I might have been dealing with DCIS stage 0 or something. At the very least not as many nodes involved if at all.  I can't beat myself up about it, just glad I took care of it at all. Saved my life.",

With her eye shadow you can wet it and turn it into an eye liner.  I bought an brush that is kind of crooked so when you apply you hold it straight in front of your eyes but it is bent towards your eyelids if that makes sense. I feel like I have more control. Also, if you use Urban Decay's eye shadow primer on your lids before you apply it will stay in place all day. ",

There are always going to be bad reviews, it isn't going to work for probably most people depending on why they have hair issues. You can always tell the fake reviews because they are over the top positive.  I have Nioxin too for when my hair gets more filled in. I didn't want to use it at this stage.",

I wear the short one to work and the blonde for going out to dinner, movies or family events. Two different sets of people see me so no confusion there.

I have to figure out how to get my pictures in here so they aren't upside down!  On the Arimidex issue, my MO said any of the AL's can cause thinning, including Tamoxin.

I've had it trimmed about 3 times I guess. I waited to get the ok from my MO. I too kept looking at my head every day for new sprouts. It was kind of fun, but this is better :) I just came in from outside and it's windy here today. I had a better one but for some reason my iPhone isn't sending it to my Mac. It's also kind of flat today. Oh well, it's hair!  ",

I hope it looks like yours soon! I have an appt with the MO on Friday and I'm going to ask about 30 day hair color.  I ran out of the Nioxin, but it was the color treated formula I used before I was dx. Gotta run out and get more tomorrow. In the mean time I'm using Hair Rush shampoo. Not bad stuff.

He did say that I could go without radiating the middle of my chest, it is not solid evidence that it is really beneficial. I'm one though that has from the beginning wanted to do everything possible to make sure it doesn't come back. If I have to get it drained down to a reasonable size then I will do it. It will delay me about a week or two . I thought originally I would be done before Thanksgiving, now if I have to take this detour, it will be more like the first week of December. :(",

Even IF it is bc, you've more then likely found it very early and that is important.  As far as your \"risk factors\" you really can't go on that. I had my first child at 26, my period at 13, I breast fed and no ZERO bc in my family. I don't really even have cancer in my family.  So while I leaned heavily on those factors, you can't rely heavily on yours. Take a deep breath and let it play out. They say 80% of suspicious lumps are benign.  Take care, I hope it is nothing!",
