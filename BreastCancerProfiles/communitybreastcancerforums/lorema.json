After lumpectomy and lymph node removal she was put in tamoxifen. In 2010, I found a very large lump on my breast after a negative memo gram 4 months prior. It was a large tumor and also 3 limph nodes were infected. I had mastectomy and 'radiation. As I finished my chemotherapy, the last treatment, my sister found out that her cancer was back. After months of complains, her doctor decided to give her an ultrasound, just to shut her up. Cancer had spread to the chest wall. She did low dose radiation and chemotherapy at the same time. After a few months of treatment a Pet Ct showed no cancer on her chest. 3 months later another Pet Ct showed 2 spots on the liver. She did avastin and paxitaxol for 3 months. The tumor decreased in size. Then she had RFA. Doctor Gellar removed 3 masses from her liver. One had been on the surface and was not seen on the scan. She did one more time avastin, but the little incision from the RFA was not closing so she had to stop. Went on Zolodex for a month and had her ovaries removed. I forgot, she was 37 at her first diagnosis. This january she had pleural effusion and 2 litters were removed from her lungs. Blood markers started going up again and another scan showed new spots on the liver. We went to see Dr Formenti at NYU the same day. She gave us so much hope. She has started a new trial with fresolimumab. At the moment there are only 5 people participating. She has seen great results with 2 patients that started the trial earlier. One of the patient had her tumor decreased by 50% in 3 weeks. The drug is the perfect one. It has no side effects, no hair loss. Fresolimumab (GC1008) is a human monoclonal antibody[1] and an immunomodulator, developed by Genzym. Dr. Formenti has great credentials and its a great human being. My sister got her first infusion a week ago. She will have a scan in 2 weeks to see how the drug is working. The good thing about this, is that you get to see the if it is working within a month. I have read all your stories and cried every time. When my sister started this I thought of all of you waiting for something as promising as this. Please do some research and call NYU. It will cost you nothing but it can put an end to your war with cancer. I pray it will... Log in to post a reply",

It inactivates all forms of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) that cancer needs to grow. in Europe is being tested for other kinds of cancers. I will keep you posted on my sisters progress.",
