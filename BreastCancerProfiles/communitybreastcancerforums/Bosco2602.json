Oct 20 I broke my collarbone and X-ray showed it was nearly eaten through, the dr said it could be cancer and at that point I pretty much new it was and lost it.. I've posted twice on different subjects, but figured I may as well own it and post here. I read a lot of posts on here and find it very informative and comforting to know I'm not alone in this diagnoses. No one I know has had bc and most just don't get the situation I'm in. 38 years old, 3 boys 9,7 and 1. I fight for them. Triple positive doing THP and I start cycle #6 a week from Friday. I also get my first scan since starting treatment that Friday. Already having nightmares that things aren't going well.",

The care from everyone there was superior to the hospital I was diagnosed at ( and that was a decent size place). I see dr nancy lin. She is amazing as is her np Christine. They have over 40 clinical trials going on now for bc alone. That was huge for me as I know one day I'll need them. Good luck in your decision",
