Waiting to see how the se's will be with this one, hopefully pretty easy like the first one, will see. It is day 15 past 1st chemo and the hair is starting to go.  Just cant be very positive about it right now, having a good cry off and on. Sure I will adjust but just feel crappy about it right now. It's good to have a place to vent a little and others know what you are feeling and going thru. Thanks.",

I ordered a few and was pleased with them. I started looking when I knew I would be needing chemo after surgery. Had surgery on april 16th, lumpectomy with axillary dissection. Go for first meet with oncologist May 8 about starting chemo treatments. Am nervous about the chemo and later radiation treatments.  Becky",

      "Content": "May 24, 2008 01:01PM - edited May 24, 2008 01:05PM by Becky--IL Hello everyone, I am 50, married,with 2 grown daughters and 1 granddaughter. I was dx 3/5/08 with IDC, had lumpectomy with axillary dissection(left side) on 4/16/08.  Told I need chemo and radiation.  My onc ordered a PET scan to further check a tiny spot on my liver before starting treatments. Good news is all organs looked clean as well as my right breast area, bad news is 2 \"hot spots\" showed on scan in left chest wall (same side as tumor).  Had to wait added week for the panel of docs to decide best course, more surgery or go ahead with treatments then do another scan.  Since the 2 spots(nodes) were located deep under muscle they said, I will go ahead with chemo and radiation, not surgery.  I am glad about that for I definitely didn't want another surgery.  I am scheduled for my first chemo next week on wed the 28th.  Pretty nervous about it, more so than facing surgery.  As of now I don't know what drugs they are giving me or how long each treatment will take, only that I need 8 treatments once every 2 weeks.  Only thing I was told so far is I will be given a 30minute information class before chemo.  If it wasn't for finding this site and reading a lot of posts, I wouldnt know what kind of things to expect. I just want to get this started and finished.  I plan to get my hair cut short the day before first chemo and getting some headcovers.  Are there any tips on what to expect at the first chemo treatment and/or after?  Things that would be good to take with me, first time, other than my notebook?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I am sure it won't be as scary as it seems right now. ",

It was more a mental problem for me about having all the toxic drugs going in my body and praying they will do more good than harm.  Treatments should only take about 90minutes, they said, which is great considering how long some patients have to stay.  I am getting the drugs Adriamycin/Cytoxan for the first 4treat and then Taxotere(spelling?) the last 4 treat. So 1 down and 7 to go. Treatments are every 2 weeks.  I also get injection each time of Neulasta. Onc wants to do another CT scan and PET scan after 4treat, hoping the chemo will take care of the 2 \"hotspots\"(L chest wall) that showed on PET couple weeks ago.(PET was done after surgery).  Keeping my fingers crossed. Feeling ok so far, nothing worse than headaches and little tired/achy.  Trying to push the fluids a lot and eat small frequent meals.  Trying not to stress about the hair loss that will happen but I know when it happens it will be emotional.  I hope everyone going thru treatments this week, whether the 1st one or further along, are doing good.  If you are yet to get your 1st, I can say as some other have, that it isnt so bad, it's doable.  I will comment again on that after I have a few treat under my belt. lol. Though I read more than I post, I feel very fortunate to have found the site for it has helped me a lot and am sure it will more as I go along in my course of treatments. The shared information and caring among everyone here is awesome. Take care and everyone have a good day",
