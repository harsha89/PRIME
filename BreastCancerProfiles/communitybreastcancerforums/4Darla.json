The feedback you receive on these boards is coming from those who have received positive results.  The 80% who receive B9 results are not usually here but they outnumber us by a large margin.  I hope you are among those 80% and never need to return to this site.  If you have to join this group, know that BC is very treatable and there is a wealth of knowledge here.  Think positive thoughts and don't let the demeanor of medical workers dictate how you feel.  They could be acting somber because of a multitude of personal reasons. Keeping my fingers crossed that all turns out well for you! ",
