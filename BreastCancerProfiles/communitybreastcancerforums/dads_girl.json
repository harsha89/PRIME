Since then I had an MRI and found out there is another lump near the same location. It is about 4mm. My surgeon is recommending a mastectomy with reconstruction. I have yet to meet with the oncologist. I am 31 years old, married, and 2 children. I wonder why you are having a lumpectomy versus a mastectomy. any reason?",

I currently have implants now and I am really trying to come to grips whether or not I should have reconstruction. It would really help me if I can get some feedback. I can use all the advice, and stories to help make a decision. I am 31 years old and married with 2 children. Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma left breast. He will be perfoming the node surgery at the same time as well. Hopefully it did not spread to the lymph nodes. Another question what are my chances of having chemotherapy. I have yet to meet with the oncologist. Best Wishes to All.",
