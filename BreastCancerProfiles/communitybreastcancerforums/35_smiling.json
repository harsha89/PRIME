As for me\u2026 I just returned from Boston last night and met with the plastic surgeon on May 8, 2013 regarding my reconstruction surgery when I receive my mastectomy on May 24, 2013.  I am still very nervous as this was not an easy decision to make.  I was given a choice to either go for another re incision with radiation (6-7.5weeks) or a mastectomy with no radiation.  After thinking about it long a hard with my husband I chose the mastectomy with reconstruction.  I just want this cancer fight to end fast.  I have been through so much since diagnosed last July 31/August 1, 2012.  The cancer spread from my breast to my spine which has left me with a rod replacing half my spine.    We decided to go with the flap reconstruction (where they use my fat tissues from my belly and move it to the breast) then they will lift my left breast to try to match it with the new right breast.  Not only am I going to have a scar on my back from my first of many surgeries but now on my belly but when I look back I will still be living and that is what\u2019s more important in my book.  Once this surgery is completed I can now say \u201cI am cancer free\u201d! Those four words I long to say.  I pray to God that this will be the end.  I know my walk will never really be over as I now need to eat, exercise and make better healthy choices in hope there is no reoccurrence with this cancer or another other form of cancer.",

RMlulu: Congratulations on for having your last radiation yesterday! Jumping for joy over here! So now that your radiation is finished what is next for you? Tammy_M42 Thanks, looking forward to start my radiation; as it will be one step closer to the end of my road. Laurascott1016: Congratulations to you too for finishing up with your radiation!  You are absolutely right about how everyone\u2019s radiation side effect is different.  I start mine shortly and at first I was afraid because reading everyone\u2019s experience scared the ja-bee-bers but then had to take a step back and tell myself that this may not happen to me so I need to take my experience day-by day, hour-by-hour and minute-by-minute and walk over the bridge when it comes.  So now your radiation is finished what is next for you?",

I hope you dont mind... repost I had my mastectomy with immediate reconstruction surgery (by using my belly fat to create my new right breast) was last week on Friday May 24, 2013. I was scheduled to be at Beth Israel Hospital by 9:30am. Got there on time and they gave me a buzzer and when it goes off that was time for prep. We (my hubby and I) sat in the waiting area until this thing buzzed...then I started crying and they told my husband they will let him in later. They got me all ready for surgery and my husband was allowed to come in. We said some prayers and I made him do a before photo with all the marker markings made from the plastic surgeon. I was still very scared and nervous. The doctor came in again and spoke to my husband and answered all his last minute questions. I was glad for that. We kissed and I was wheeled into surgery which six hours later it turned out. I woke up and my husband was the first I saw. I was super happy and very scared to look under the covers now. I have a follow up appointment with the plastic surgeon tomorrow so, I hope me and hubby are doing things okay. The drainage's are a bit discomforting to do but we get it done. I am still very sore but once things heal it would look better....I hope anyway. I find it hard to look at myself right now.  its really not a pretty sight to see...I thought looking at other women will help me but seeing it first hand on my own body is just a shock for me. I am super excited that my insurance paid 100% and I am doing good and coming along well.",
