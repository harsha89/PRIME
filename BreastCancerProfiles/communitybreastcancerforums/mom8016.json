Up to 4th round everything was okay only when we started the 5th round that the itching began and was  horrible. I  am now itching all over my body but mostly on my toes and fingers. Sometimes I take Benadryl to overcome the itching but it helps for a while and start right back again. Does anybody know what to do? Is anyone having similar side effects? I am thinking about stop the all treatment, for I I have not even started the AC rounds yet. Please advice.   Log in to post a reply",

I am 42 and the MO mentioned that because I was young and the cancer seemed to be very aggressive. my concern is the long term side effects of chemo because regardless of chemo treatment the probability of recurrence is still about 24%. So why taking the chemo. That the part I don't get.",
