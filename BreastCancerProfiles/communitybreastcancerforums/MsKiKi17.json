I have tissue expanders in now and I am planning on getting one more fill. The exchange will take place 2-3 months after the last TE fill. The pain initially was unbearable and I went through a lot of pain medication. If I had known the pain was going to be that/this bad I would have opted to have mastectomies without reconstruction. The nerve pain drives me crazy. I will take Tylenol or Ibuprofen occasionally. It would be nice to find something that really helps with the pain.",
