I know like you said we're doing it for the right reasons but it sure doesn't make it any easier. It's funny because I mention it to my friends and they just think it's no big deal, it's what I have to do. It is a big deal though!!!! My lump was removed during a biopsy, but no clear margins. So I did the 4 rounds of A/C and 12 of Taxol, all done last month, will have this surgery followed by rads. Keep me posted Erika",

The problem with that is there are no DIEP surgeons where I live to consult with before the mastectomy. No sentinel node biopsy yet. I am pretty sure I will have the rads just based on everything I've been told. I'm glad you're confused too in a way, that means I'm not losing it, yet :)",

      "Content": "Oct 3, 2009 01:51PM - edited Feb 10, 2010 03:13PM by Dragonfly1976 Swampy - I am in the same boat right now. I just had my double mastectomy on the 25th. The cancer was all gone from the chemo, but they took out a massive amount of nodes, 22!!! WOW! 21 were totally negative, 1 had some fibrosistic changes or something like that, but it said NO residual cancer so they don't know if there was ever any in that 1 node? Anyway, no residual in the left breast, and none in the right. I asked the breast surgeon if I'd still need rads? She said she thought so because of my age (32) I am VERY worried as my left arm does have some swelling and pain still, though it's only been a week. So she does have me set up to see a PT for 4 weeks to help with ROM and check for lymphadema. I've heard rads can really increase the risk for lymphadema, and also heard what you said that if you do rads there now you can't later? I do have recon planned for April, but if I don't do rads I could go a lot sooner for that. So frustrating, how do you know if you're making the right decision? Someone told me the radiologist can tell you what the rads will even do as far as % of it coming back? ",
