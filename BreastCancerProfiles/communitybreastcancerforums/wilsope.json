OK I never had much to begin with, and my husband has said many times he would rather me look like this with him than look as good as I used to and be in a box.  I had a double mast in July this year. Everyone who knows me, knows that they were removed, so anything there would be fake, look it and everyone would know it! Who cares? I don't like the look in the mirror, but I am getting used to it. I try not to think of it as a bad thing. I look at my scars as medals of honor, I got breast cancer and I won!!! I would like to shout it from the rooftops. I know that I see the odd \"stare\" in stores, and shopping is challenging. I am a size 0 or 2, so finding age appropriate clothes has always been difficult. I am 50.  My husband has been in and out of hospitals for 2 years and is now facing kidney transplant (I was to be the donor and that is how they found the cancer) Our son is donating his kidney so the amount of time I will be spending in a hospital environment is enough. I don't look like everyone else but I am perfectly healthy. What more do I want?",
