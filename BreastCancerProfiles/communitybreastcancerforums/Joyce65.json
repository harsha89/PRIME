I'm lucky, I am retired so I do not have to juggle children or work. I had my first round of CMF 3/7 and have been searching for information on the typical \"course\" of the treatment cycle. I just keep wondering if I will get to feel \"normal\" again before round 2 of chemo in a week, or if a certain level of fatigue will be my new normal for awhile. I'm having my CMF every 2 weeks for 8 rounds with Nulasta OnPro. I felt fairly well the first day after chemo which I will chalk up to the steroids they gave me pre-infusion. My second full day was my worst; I was just so tired with no desire to do anything (very strange for me because I'm a very energetic person). Each day since I've felt good in the mornings and tired in the afternoons. I would describe the nausea kind of like seasickness (if you have any experience with that); no need to vomit, just low grade queasiness. I did find eating small amounts every few house to be helpful, but I have no appetite. I too have struggled with constipation but with Colace 2x per day and Senokot at bedtime, things have regulated.The nausea is in the rear view mirror, but the lack of desire to eat is still present, but I can deal with that. If you are taking Neulasta, make certain to take the Claritin and some Tylenol on a regular schedule. I was having low level bone pain, but nothing debilitating and then I forgot to take the Claritin....I won't do that again! I appreciate the posts from those of you who are further along than I. It's so great to find a community of others going through the same treatment protocol.",

There is a small study that showed the effectiveness of the Claritan. You should take it the day of your chemo (so the day before the Neulasta shot) and for the following 4 days, so 5 days total. It turns out histamines are generated when the white blood cells are being produced which is part of the cause for the bone pain, so subjects in the study found the Claritan helped. Don't know if you can use any old antihistamine since the study was done using Claritan. Make certain to ask your oncologist about the supplements. There are some that you should avoid while on CMF.",

I too had a high level of physical activity and fitness coming into it, so I'm walking some each day, and as I've felt better over the 4 days, I even took a \"fast\" walk for exercise in Central Park (my go to spot). I had to skip the big hill and went a mile less and a bit slower then pre-chemo, but all-in-all I felt good. I've been a nut about washing my hands and everything that is raw. With your advice and experience, I'll continue to be vigilent. I'm hopeful my hair will stay put. again, thank you! Joyce",

I've had less nausea and fatigue, but honestly, a bit more bone pain; though not debilitating in any way. I think of my bone pain as little factories creating white blood cells so if I'm experiencing some pain, it means the factory is working really hard! Sometimes positive visuals are a really helpful thing. I have found that a heating pad has been helpful with the bone pain. I encourage you to get out and walk every day, at least a little bit if you can. I find it helps with how I feel both physically and mentally. Do you have a park near your home? I spend my time in Central Park and it does me such good. As for the constipation, it seems like we've all had to learn to manage this side effect. I still don't have it quite figured out. I stop my Colace and Senekote because things seem good and then I get stopped up again. I think part of it is that I'm a very active person so my body is having trouble normalizing when I am less active. I'm writing everything down in hopes of getting it right after round 3.  Inthegray, it's great to hear that round 3 might be even better than this one, something to look forward to.",

If you aren't keeping a journal of your side effects, eating, etc. I would strongly recommend it. It really helps me to be able to look back at the same day 1 or 2 treatments ago and know what to expect. It's not always the same, but there is definitely similarity in the patterns. I've found that while my appetite comes back during the second week, my taste buds aren't really working very well anymore. I can taste and enjoy sweet things, but all the things I should be eating for my health just have no flavor. My nurse suggested using lots of fresh herbs to add flavor, so I'm trying that, also there are so many foods I just don't want to eat.....and I'm a foodie! As for the hair, I'm sorry it is already thinning for you. I have cut back to washing mine every 3 days, I gently towel dry and then finger/air dry. I am no longer using a hair dryer unless I have somewhere to go and want to look well put together, then I let it air dry until it's almost dry and style it lightly on a very low heat. If your hair is long, you may want to consider cutting it shorter so its easier to deal with and doesn't require as much styling/brushing. As a just-in-case, you may want to visit a wig salon to match your color and style so you can quickly order something if you find you need it. I've also practiced tying headscarves in case I need it. Stay strong, appreciate your good days and get out and enjoy the spring weather if you can!",

I felt terrible when I woke up this morning, queasy, bone pain, headache, but drugs, a heating pad, a little toast and coffee seems to have revived me a bit. I am finding I am experiencing lower energy with each round. I get out every day for a good walk and I still manage to have a fairly normal second week (including 3 days of true exercise), but feel a bit more winded as each cycle passes. Food is the funniest thing. I find lunch is the meal where I can eat a bit more normally. I have to be really careful at the dinner slot, or I upset my stomach, so I've gone to soups for dinner followed by my craving which is vanilla gelato! Something I would never normally eat. Happily, my weight is stable. My doctor did say some women gain weight on CMF so just keep an eye on things. Good luck with your next round! I'm here for you and appreciate the community!",

I tend to drink approximately 90 ounces of water daily for the first week along with ginger tea, ginger ale, etc. 250 ounces sounds like overkill, but whatever works for you. I'm finding I can exercise during the second week after treatment, not as aggressive as pre-chemo, but still fairly vigorous. I must admit that my taste buds are not working well -- sweet yes, but the rest, not much flavor. I make myself eat, but really have limited interest. I find protein shakes at lunch are a big help.

Hopefully my future treatments will follow a similar pattern.

They also suggested eating small meals every couple of hours to keep something on your stomach; turns out an empty stomach is our worst enemy for the nausea....who knew? I find I'm not the least bit hungry, but make myself eat anyway, just simple things.... As for liquids, make certain you stay hydrated. Try seltzer water, sometimes bubbles make it more palatable.
