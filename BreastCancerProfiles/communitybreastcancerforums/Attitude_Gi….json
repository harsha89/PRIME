I had my first chemo yesterday - E-CMF regime for the next 6 months. It wasn't as bad as I thought/anticipated but I had an anaphylactic/severe allergic reaction an hour after I finished the treatment and had to stay in for another 6 hours till it settled. I'm okay today but tired (having lots of piriton so that's probably why) bit light headed and starting to get mouth ulcers and dry eyes. My OH had the day off today, as he was worried because of the reaction yesterday, and he made me a lovely souffle for lunch, will miss that next week when he's back at work! I don't know if they will stop this part of the treatment as Onc said she would discuss what we'll do before next round in 3 weeks. I'm going to the allergy clinic on the 18th and the hospital are going to give me a list of all the drugs I had this treatment and at my re-excision (where I also had a reaction) to take in the hope we can identify what starts me off... Not sure how I feel about carrying on or stopping... reactions are v scary but the positve benefit of the chemo was high. Got to go have funny feeling around nose and my specs (need to type!) are making it worse. Katie",

Day time telly is pants and I am bored!! I'm going to try work tomorrow, probably way to early but can't sit here, I'm going mad and I'm sure the thinking time is not doing me good.I'm the boss so if I find it's too much I'll shut up shop and go home. No sickness, not taking any tablets, a bit light headed but less than when having steroids. Chemical pong in my nose still driving me mad but I'm eating - just made an advocado dip (all organic, advocado, tomatos, chives, lemon) with totillas (naughty and healthy!) losing weight which considering I'm not \"going\" is supprising! I was warned about diarrhea so haven't taken anything just in case it starts although have eaten some dates and fruit cake...  sorry to go on - too much time and I'm not used to sitting down and feeling this useless, no way can I feel like this for the next 6 months. Suggestions if I can't manage work?? By the way I've done house paperwork before I started chemo and it's never been so clean at home!! Aggh Katie  x x x x",

I'm checked every 12 weeks so am happy that I went with him and feel secure in the knowledge that I have tried to give my self the best chance and hopefully more time even if I lose a boob/boobs a bits at a time.",
