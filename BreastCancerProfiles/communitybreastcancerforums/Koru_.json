So, Round #2 comes up for me on Thursday.  I'm finding myself somewhat encouraged by what you all are reporting in from Round #2.  I missed a week of work from Round #1 and hope to minimize that for Round #2. My niece had a bilateral mastectomy on 4/29 and I'm scheduled to take my great nephew (10) and great niece (7) to school on Monday.  It has been a double whammy for my family (she is my niece by marriage not blood related); both of us being diagnosed within 45 days of each other. Okay, I'm going to try to close my eyes again for an hour or two; hoping to be up to go to the beach with some girlfriends in the early morning hours of the day before the sun gets too high and it gets too hot out. Happy Cinco de Mayo! ",

It is a \"Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse.\"  Here's the link:  www.,mugard.com It is specifically for chemo and radiation patients. It is FABULOUS!  My mouth was significantly better within 24 hours and I have used it a few times preventatively after round #2 when I could feel the sores threatening to come back. I had oral surgery 4 days before starting round #1, so good luck, Virginger - hope the tooth settles down!   @MinusTwo:  You might want to ask about going in for additional fluids.  My MO calls them, \"HAPPY MEALS\".  They can be just saline or they can also include additional antiemetics and/or steroids.  I went one time after my first chemo and I have had three bags of additional fluids after chemo #2 and will make it a practice to get additional fluids on the days that I just get Herceptin.  The onc nurses all swear by getting additional fluids and sometimes it is just so hard to keep ahead of the drying effects of the chemo - even if you're pushing fluids and drinking, drinking, drinking!  I told someone today that I feel like all the water that was in my body has been pumped out and replaced by drying hazardous chemicals.  I feel like a dried-up hazmat dumping site! I'm looking forward to going to the pool tomorrow and becoming one with the water!  @PamelaKay:  Thank you so much for the comic relief!  It has been a tough few days for me emotionally, \"Pity Party, Party of 1 your table is ready!\"  So, thanks for the smiles.   @AllieM:  My hands got very itchy, irritated and swollen and I was told it was a se.  The itching has stopped but now they are peeling and I'm also experiencing \"radiation recall\" at my surgical site.  Hydrocortisone cream didn't really help much.  Nurse prescribed PruTect topical emulsion - generic cost (insurance wouldn't cover it) $62.",

My worst complaint is fatigue.  My hemoglobin was at 8.4 on Friday and the nurse said it will probably dip a little lower than that before starting to return to normal.  I'm encouraged by those of you that are a few weeks PFC that are feeling much better.  I'm trying to be patient, yet I must admit it isn't working very well. EVERYTHING seems to take massive amounts of energy to do and my arms and hips feel like they've been filled with lead and are just too heavy to move. I'm also dealing with lots of tearing, taxotere nails and skin rash/irritation on my lower arms and one leg.  I have some minor neuropathy in most of my fingertips.  My skin is so dry I feel like I need to get dipped in a vat of some high end moisturizing cream and then have a team of about four or five guys rub it in until my skin returns to its pre-cancer lustre. I have been blessed with three really great teams - my surgeon and his team, my radiologist and his team and now my MO and his team.   I want to say a big thank you to everyone that has actively posted.  The sharing of information has been great, but more importantly it  has been a big help to me personally to have this virtual support network.  Everyone being so open and honest about their SE's and what they are going through personally has helped me tremendously. The past week or so has been extremely difficult for me - hitting a wall emotionally where I have just been completely \"over\" all of it and indulging in a bit of a pity party for a few days.  I believe I'm on the other side of the worst of my despondency and I hope and pray that I'm on the other side of the worst of things physically and that now I can start to get some stamina and strength back.  This time last year I was in training for roller derby; now I need to use the handicap cart at the grocery store.  I have a lot of ground to regain and hope my hemoglobin starts to increase so that I feel like I can push myself and get more done. Thank you all for listening.  Sending each of you a warm hug any my best prayers of encouragement for wherever you are in your process; may the light of your heart and the love of your God/Goddess/Creator see you through this!

I started my first round of Taxotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin on 4/18 with a Neulasta shot on 4/19.  The Neulasta shot hit me super hard; I couldn't even sit up due to the pain in my pelvis and low back and I was following the recommended regimen of ibuprofen rotated with acetominaphin every 4 hours in addition to the Clairitin.  I experienced abdominal cramping and diarrhea along with some of the most severe mouth sores my MO has seen in a long time.   I have had compazine and bentyl prescribed to help settle down all things digestive and received a bottle of MuGard to help with the mouth sores.  (I was also prescribed some Magic Mouthwash, but my stomach couldn't even handle it being in my mouth.)  The MuGard has been a godsend for me and I would highly recommend it.  They've already told me that next time I'll be sucking on ice chips. I wanted to be the one to decide when my hair was going instead of the chemo drugs, so I planned a spa day head shave with family and friends and it was covered in the local newspaper: http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/like-samson-in-reverse-she-gets-power-from-shearing-her-locks/2115205#comments I did some extensive youtube research and Survivor Kristy Greenwood has an AWESOME series of six videos posted.  You can find her first video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC_mXSVU1nc  She also has a facebook page here:  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mission-Mine/132753804315.  I learned how to tie a head scarf from watching her videos and people stop me every time I am out and about with a head scarf on and compliment me on it or ask me how I learned to tie it.  You'll enjoy the videos  they are so well done and her heart is just amazing.  They are a gift to all of us that will be going through this process of losing our hair. @Gardengirl:  I saved ALL my hair.  It is in a pink bottle that is in the shape of a bubble with a fleur de lis stopper on top!  I encourage you to keep yours, too!  I also have a girlfriend that has offered to have henna art done on my head.  I'm thinking once I'm past the halfway point (sometime after round 3 for me) I will have a henna artist come to my home and invite my friends over and we'll make another party out of it.  The artist has said she can do smaller designs that would be similar to mine on my friends' hands or feet so that they can join in the fun and show their solidarity! @Rosina:  YOU ROCK!!!  @Virginger:  Wishing you all the best for your BIG BUZZ tomorrow!!! @Schoenme:  I was given 50mg of benadryl as a pre-med when I arrived.  My first trip was on a Thursday and lasted about 5+ hours - most of it was spent hanging out with the Sandman in Dreamland. :-)  I went to dinner and played trivia with the family that night; went to work on Friday and got my Neulasta shot Friday afternoon.  My SE's didn't really start rolling in until about 3 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.  Yep that was when the storm hit.  Wishing you all the best - EVERYONE is different (as you can tell) and I think it takes a first experience to establish a baseline for how your biochemistry is going to handle the chemotherapy.  My MO said they would be tweaking things for me for Round 2.  (Hallelujah!)  I also took a crocheted blankie my grandmother made for me when I was just 8 years old and I did use it.  I also wore a goddess necklace my mother gave me. My sister and another very dear sisterfriend went with me and sat through the entire time with me!  The VERY BEST of luck to you as you begin tomorrow!!!!",

The concoction she brought me from the bar was the BEST thing I've had in forevah!  The sour of the lime made smooth by some coconut flavor was whipped together for some frozen bliss.  Just writing it has me craving it again; maybe I need another trip to Outback before the blech of Day 3 hits.

I had mentioned in my previous post about the 3 hour \"prep\" time being analagous to Dorothy getting ready to go see the Wizard in the Wizard of Oz.  I mentioned in my personal blog today that the surgery doesn't freak me out as much as then anesthesia.  I have these irrational fears around it.  I would prefer they just give some nice happy drug and do the surgery under a local.  (13 years ago I tried to convince my orthopedic surgeon to do my ACL reconstruction while giving me an epidural.)  Anyway, back to the Wizard of Oz.......I was thinking I might ask the anesthesiologist if he brought any poppies into the OR with snow as a back up for wakey-wakey time! It has been really great to read how you all say that we're going through the worst of it now; that post-surgery really is so much better.  I feel much encouraged by your words! The municipality that I work for puts on a St. Patrick's Day Festival each year and I do a lot of the coordinating of the event - I didn't want to miss out getting all the vendors checked in and settled in and the festival started.  I'm glad I went.  I kept pretty busy today and now that evening time is hear I find myself a little weepy and feeling a little sorry for myself.  I know you all understand.  I'm not one to suffer a pity party for myself for too long - so I'll be off in search of a feel-good chick flick and out of the pity party in two shakes of a lamb's tail. I will be thinking of you, Gardengirl and pattysmiles as I head to the hospital tomorrow.  Mamasixtaz - I will keep you in my prayers for Tuesday. I'm grateful for this virtual world; yet I wish there was a retreat center where we could meet and celebrate on the other side of this!

Think positive thoughts, visualize yourself healed and full of life-affirming vitality! Marianelizabeth....You have amazed me with your physical accomplishments that you have shared with us. I am trusting that the mapping and rads will go well for you, too! Maybe your PS will get that changed to a date that is more comfortable for you. Maureen - Your positive attitude is inspiring and I just don't know how you manage to keep up with all of us! Thank you for that. I have to give a big thank you to all of the sisters that had surgery before me and posted that it would be better after it was over. You were right! My procedure went well and I am doing MUCH better than I thought I would be.

She's with me and thinks its a great idea, but somehow I just don't think she's going to be able to pull that one off! I'm hoping and praying for clear margins and negative lymph nodes as my surgeon is placing a cavity evalutation device in anticipation of being able to do Mammosite radiation which will cut my radiation treatment from 6-1/2 weeks down to only one week of 2x/per day treatments.  Then, on to chemo. I've met with the MO and his tentative plan is to start chemo about a month after the surgery; he is thinking 6 rounds of TCH provided my nodes are negative.  Of course, the herceptin is a year-long commitment that will happen with negative or positive nodes.  What I'm wondering is, when they actually remove the port a year from now, do I get to keep it as a souvenir???? I truly appreciate reading everyone's story; your individual experiences with your surgery and how you are faring with your recoveries and next treatment steps.  You are all an inspiration!   I was blind-sided by a routine mammo and there has been so very much for me to take in, learn and integrate in the days since 2/1/13.  Next steps for me are beginning my investigation into juicing and how I can provide the most robust nutrition to my body as I look to face the onslaught of chemo. My prayers are not only with all of us that are going through this and our families but also with the surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, nurses, office staff, researchers, janitorial crews, etc.  There is a huge cooperative effort that has gone into our care.  And, while I may not have an inexhaustible list of everyone that has had any part to do with my care, I pray that they are blessed through their chosen line of work - for their chosen line of work has all come together to make it possible for me to have this cancer treated and moved out of my life.",

I feel I am sailing through all this and amazed at how well I am doing.  So many people have told me they are praying for me, sending healing energy and lighting candles - I feel confident all of those good wishes have folded into a remarkable event-free experience thus far. I finally got my Mammosite radiation catheter out on Friday and my Radiation Oncology Team provided me with a Graduation Diploma.  The week was very intense with two appointments daily and three appointments on two days.  It was a very consuming week. I am going to take Monday and Tuesday to regroup and head back to work on Wednesday.  I'm taking breakfast of bagels and cream cheese along with orange juice and some donuts to the team on Monday for being so incredibly wonderful.  My RO even gave me a hug and a kiss after taking out the Mammosite Catheter on Friday.   My chemo will begin on 4/18.  Six rounds of Taxotere, Carboplatin and Herceptin.  Of course, once the Taxotere and Carboplatin are discontinued I will continue with the Herceptin for a year along with I think the MO said Tamoxifen for a couple of years and then he will switch me over to another oral med after that. I'm grateful for the camaraderie that you've all provided during this month.  It has been so inspiring and supportive and encouraging. My best wishes to each and every one of you as we \"March\" past our surgeries into the next phase of our healing process!",
