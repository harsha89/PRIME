You guys are right about not reading about it. There's lots of scary stuff out there. Luckily I have a very good friend going through this. She also has no history of breast cancer in her family. Thank you all. I'll check in after Tuesday. .",

So that really scares me as my spot is on the outer breast. This waiting just is driving me crazy. My husband refuses to talk about it and is shutting me out. I don't think I can do this alone. I do have great friends and have my faith, but it this is cancer I am afraid our marriage will suffer. Does anyone else understand this\"???",

Tried to do on Wednesday but the doctor did not want to because it is so close to a blood vessel and didn't want to miss it. They were a contacted 'truck' that comes to my local hospital. The follow-up was horrible. Said \"I guess you need to find a breast doctor and schedule an MRI\". But they didn't give me any names. The radiologist was nice but didn't offer much other than saying she would let me MD know. I immediately called my MDs nurse, who got in touch with a very food Breast Cancer Center and scheduled me an appointment today. The breast surgeon and nurse were awesome. He examined me and then reviewed my records. He was also very scared to do the stereotactic biopsy. Reviewed with a radiologist who thought he could probably do it but was too busy to do today. So I have an appointment for next Tuesday. They are going to do a regular surgical biopsy and also want to biopsy lymph nodes under my arm. The surgeon kept saying they were suspicious and funky looking, but really praised me for annual mammograms. Said they had grown and I had to have a biopsy. I have an appointment on Friday as a follow up with him to determine the results. This is very scary and my gut is not thinking this is benign. My doctor kept saying whatever, he is there for me and will get me through it. He was very kind, also gave me another gynecologist to start going to. Sorry so lengthy - just am scared. My husband deals with this by being quiet. My kids are older and I don't want them scared yet. Renee",

He still wants to see me tomorrow to talk about options and wants to follow up every 3 months. I am delighted and exhausted from the waiting! Any idea what a followup on a micro calcification cluster might be??",
