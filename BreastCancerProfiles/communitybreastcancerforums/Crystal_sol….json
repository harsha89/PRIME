My first instinct is to pull out the big guns (hence the double mastectomy asap after diagnosis) but the onco test is what's holding me back. My report actually gives a higher rate of recurrence/mortality with chemo than with tamoxifen alone. The only instructions they gave me for the PET was fasting for 12 hours, which I did. I have extensively searched for info on IMLNs, as one of the positive axillary nodes was an intramammary node. (In the tissue of the inner quadrant of breast, right behind tumor) from my understanding the intramammary node is treated the same as axillary nodes, but internal mammary nodes are a whole different story. Still not much info out there. I just want to be as informed as possible before making a decision as to treatment. ",

However when I got the pathology report it reads \"intramammary lymph node that has essentially been replaced by a 9mm cancer deposit\" and it has \"extracapsular extension\" so it has to have been growing for a while (it never showed on mammography or ultrasound, neither did my tumor) I highly suspect that spots on PET are inflammation, I also had an infection in the right breast 2 weeks after mastectomy and had to be reopened and cleaned out. I'm just having a hard time making such a big decision without knowing for sure. Yes my er/pr are strongly receptive so I think you're right about the blockers!",
