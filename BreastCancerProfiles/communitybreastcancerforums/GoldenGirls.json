In the meantime I am also pushing for the BRCA 1 and 2 testing. I feel like my boobs are ticking timebombs because of the strong cancer history in my family. Sad really, as I use to love my big floppy boobs! Now they scare me :(",

Every tech in the mammography dept said it felt like regular breast tissue. They ordered my previous mammogram images from the hospital I used to go to in another city for more to compare it to and were satisfied that it was not of concern. I have kept an eye (and hand!) on it for the last year and it still feels exactly the same.

After feeling around quite a bit, I feel similar, though not as pronounced, \"tubular\" tissue deep inside around both areolas.  If you have any doubts and have the option to see a surgeon, then it's good that you're doing it.

The ultrasound was just part of screening because of my mother's breast cancer history. Due to my age (38), my doctor sent me for my first mammogram 2 years ago, and an ultrasound last year and this one. I was told they found a small multiseptated cyst. Between her poor English skills and her rush to get on to the next patient, she didn't explain to me what this is or why she wants to follow up on it. She pointed out the word \"benign\" on the report but then went on to say that she wants me to have another ultrasound in 4 or 5 months time to see if there are any changes. If it's benign then why follow up? I have a \"simple cyst\" on my other breast which she didn't seem concerned about at all. Can anyone tell me if this type of cyst could actually be cancer or become cancer? I looked it up online and what little I could find of these on breasts all indicated that a biopsy should be the next step! I don't want to wait months for another ultrasound only to end up with late stage cancer like my mom did thanks to a doctor's complacency about a cyst that was suspicious. (Thankfully my mom is almost at her 10 year survival mark from stage 3 cancer with extensive lymphnode involvement!) Any insight would be great. I am really freaking here :( Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013. She passed away from complications from bone metastases Dec 2016.

To answer your question--though quite late!-- my mom was diagnosed just over 10 years ago and is still cancer-free :) She was advanced stage 3 when they found it even though she had yearly mammograms which is why I worry so much. By the same token she came out of what looked like a very bleak diagnosis so I also try to remember that when I get scared. I hope you're doing well and would love an update. xo",

My mother's onc is head of oncology at the cancer center and leads a research team.He goes by her symptoms more than scans. Her bone mets diagnosis came from a CT and bone scan, followed by 3 biopsies because getting the right sample from bone is also difficult. Demand a different type of scan even if your bone scan was clear. It will put your mind at ease. Good luck!",

The surgery was more complicated than expected because there were a lot more mets in the leg than could be accurately seen on scans. They were able to get a rod in but every time they tried to add some of the screws the bone would give out so they had to leave it at just a few screws so the rod isn't as stable as they'd hoped. This means that she will remain in a splint and on a walker for a few months which the surgery was supposed to help her avoid. The only good thing is that she won't be bedridden as she had been these past few weeks. There is no elevator in her building so we are going to have to scramble to sell her condo and find her something on a ground floor or with an elevator, which unfortunately, is not easy in the small town she lives in. She was still very loopy and out of it when I left the hospital so I don't know how much information she actually retained. Hoping this isn't too big a blow to her spirits because so far, even with all the crap cancer has thrown at her, she has managed to be upbeat and in good spirits. She handles pain like a champ, but anything that effects her independence is tough for her to swallow. Will keep you posted. And thanks again for your input and support :)",

We already knew that she's had several skull mets for the past 4 years, but they are very concerned about a large one at the base of her skull and how much the skull is deteriorating. She begins radiation to the spot tomorrow but the radiation oncologist feels that these skull mets are a game changer and thinks it's time to stop treatment. Her regular onc is away on vacation and has no idea that this is happening at the moment. She is in hospital because of a fracture and I pushed for answers on these symptoms since no one else seemed to care that her hearing has diminished rapidly. I've been doing the usual research on skull mets and particularly those located at the base of the skull but would like to hear from anyone who has personal experience with skull mets. This certainly explains a lot of her symptoms, which I thought was a good thing, until the rad onc spoke. I should point out that he has been all about the doom and gloom since she was first dx'd with mets. Had we thought the way he did my mother wouldn't have enjoyed the last 4 years -- most of which have been very good years. Hoping her regular onc has a different opinion as his goal has always been to keep her alive as long as possible and feeling as good as possible, while the rad onc has always had a \"you're gonna die anyway so why not just stop wasting time with treatment and enjoy yourself instead\" sort of attitude. If you have experience you'd like to share, my mother could really use it. Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013. She passed away from complications from bone metastases Dec 2016. Log in to post a reply",

So frustrating, especially when it's in parts of her body that make it impossible to even leave the house. She's done 5 years Tamoxifen, 6 years Femara, and now 1 year on Aromasin for her mets. Maybe it's all just catching up with her. She was spoiled in that the tamoxifen and femara never gave her any SEs over all those years.",

No one knows for sure what is causing it so finding the right meds to get it under control has been a nightmare so far. She was convinced it was from Zometa, but has now been off it for a few months and the pain continues. It was happening while she was stable and is still happening with progression. (She switches to Faslodex from Aromasin tomorrow). The thing that has the doctors stumped is the pattern of the pain since it doesn't seem to jive with mets pain, especially since it was already happening when her cancer was stable/regressing in some areas. So, she asked me to share an example of her \"pain pattern\" here and see if anyone here has experienced something similar and what medication she could try next for the pain. This is an example of how her pain has been going for months now: November 1- 9: Severe pain in rib and right shoulder. November 9: pain in rib and shoulder much better but new pain in upper thigh November 10 - 21: severe pain in upper thigh all the way down to the knee - can't walk most days, pain very bad November 22: pain in thigh much better, now pain in lower back on other side starting November 23 - December 2: severe pain in lower back, can't stand or sit too long December 2 - back pain getting better December 4 - 13: severe pain in left shoulder, no pills make it better The pain stays in each place for around 10 days and as it improves another pops up in a totally different part of the body and stays the same amount of time. This pattern has continued for months and most of the time she is in debilitating pain. Some of them feel worse upon getting up and ease up with movement while others get worse with movement. She says some feel like bone pain (deep aching that almost feels like the bone is cold) and others are like the burning muscle pain like you'd feel after a very intense workout. She had a bone density test which was normal and the doctor doesn't see signs of osteoporosis or bone loss.  Anyone experience this sort of pain and have any idea what it was from? Sorry for the long post. I'm typing what she is asking and being as detailed as possible :) Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013.

He decided that if the pain and symptoms continued after stopping Zometa that he would switch her treatment (Aromasin) because it must mean progression that maybe wasn't being seen on scans at the time. The pain is still not consistent with her mets but because they can't be explained she is onto a new treatment making us wonder the same thing that you are.

I feel for you because I know what it's like to worry about health issues, especially having seen others close to me go through cancer. I can tell you that anxiety disorder can make you feel physical symptoms, so any pain that you are having from your breast/armpit can easily be feeling much worse because of your anxiety about it. I can't believe how many symptoms I have ended up with after working myself into a tizzy over something. It was especially bad after a friend died from cervical cancer at a very young age. I was so upset and so scared that every last little thing I felt sent a jolt of sheer terror through me, sending me into a panic. By the time my test results were in I was hysterical just walking into the doctor's office only to find out that I was fine. I have to stop myself often from letting the fear from my mother's breast cancer carry me away because it so easily gets the better of me and before I know it I am convinced that I am feeling every symptom that I have read about in relation to breast cancer. Anxiety, fear, and stress can have a major toll on our physical health and make us feel actual pain and other physical symptoms. The best thing that we can do is be vigilant about our health which you are already doing by having the lump checked out. It's not easy but knowing that you are already doing everything you can has to bring you some peace of mind or you'll just drive yourself nuts. Take it from someone who's been there...more than once. Beesie gave you a lot of good information and valid reasons to stay positive. Hugs",

Mine is at the 1 o'clock position just above the aereola and quite hard. The doctor and the tech felt it but nothing was seen on my ultrasound or mammo. The tech said it felt like a bit of hard breast tissue but nothing unusual. They were very thorough because of my family history (mom recently moved to stage 4 after 11 years since her initial diagnosis). They have compared images to the previous mammo done 9 months ago as well as other ultrasounds I had done and although it's not the final report, the radiologist was pretty confident that she didn't see anything there. Like you, I am feeling a little uneasy about it because I have cystic breasts as well as this feels very different and definitely harder than anything else I have ever felt. I also only found it in the first place because I was having shooting/stabbing pain behind the nipple along with a burning sort of sensation. Getting a referral to a breast specialist here when your tests come back clear is very difficult, but I think i may persue it anyway for my own piece of mind. Have you gotten any more answers about your hard line/vein?",

I always have questions when I am not at an appointment with her when a decision is made, but it's more for my own understanding of what's happening and what to expect than not trusting him. He's been her onc for over 14 years now and his instincts have always been spot-on even. When first dx with mets, she had 3 negative biopsies. This of course made us want to believe that it wasn't mets. He didn't settle for what the biopsy results were saying because his experience told him otherwise and he persisted, even sternly telling the doctor doing the final biopsy to \"get it right this time and get a good sample from the lesion\". Thank god for his instinct, experience, and persistence because it was indeed mets. His experience and instincts were right again when my mom's pain changed and her scans were still showing stable. He didn't push her to switch treatments right away but did warn that her symptoms have always been a better indicator of progression in her case than CT and MRI. He was right again...and again since that. So far her scans don't show changes until the progression is significant. (They don't use PET here) He is very aware of balancing treatment for the best results and keeping her quality of life as good as possible and will be the first to recommend a change or a break if he feels that her side effects could become a problem. Just wish I could get her to stop downplaying side effects! I'll never stop asking questions because I want to know as much as possible--likely because it makes me feel better and like I have some sort of control)--but I trust that every decision he makes in regard to her care is the best for her at the time. I figure he didn't get to be head of oncology and lead the research team for nothing. ;)",

We were thrilled when the first and then the second biopsy came back negative, but the onc was convinced the samples must have been \"missing something\" even though they were guided biopsies because lytic lesions are very often malignant. Her bone density test just a couple months earlier showed perfectly strong bones and they are still very hard and strong despite the lytic lesions. It  wasn't the answer we wanted and we really did hold out hope over those 3 months that it was going to be something other than cancer, but now we're grateful that the onc didn't just accept the negative biopsy and persisted. He told me point blank that even with the 2 negative biopsies that he was certain it was cancer and that a better sample would confirm it. He was right. My mom's follow-up scan done the same week as the 3rd biopsy showed that one of the lesions had grown (and become significantly more painful). The onc said that an open/surgical biopsy might be the only way to get a sufficient sample. That was going to be our next step if the 3rd didn't confirm it. Maybe that's an option for your daughter? I hope you get the answers you need and I pray that they're benign.",

She has been pain-free since being put on Xeloda over a year ago and recently has been having severe pain in her right buttock, thigh, and groin that sometimes radiates to her knee. Since CT scans aren't always able to show small amounts of bone progression accurately, her onc has said that he can switch treatment if her pain doesn't improve. With Xeloda being an easy treatment for her and her scan being stable, I'm worried that she's switching treatment before she needs to. Her onc has always found her pain to be a good indicator of progression in her, but still, I can't help but wonder if the pain is being caused by something other than progression; specifically the compression fractures. Has anyone had a compression fracture in any of these vertebrae that caused severe leg and groin pain? Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013.

She told me to make sure I always follow up any tests with my doctor but that there was nothing found. Whew! Now if only I could completely relax! I guess being caught off guard by my mom's diagnosis and the long runaround we got, I can't help but worry a little until I know that the radiologist has had time to really carefully examine all the images for the final report.

It was that scan that got the ball rolling on all of this. I was told that bone lesions don't usually show in an ultrasound so I know that bone mets is still a real possibility. I just don't understand why they would bother with the lymph node biopsy on the other side since no one seemed too concerned about it to begin with. I thought it would have made more sense to do a bone biopsy if nothing was found in the clavicle that they could aspirate with an ultrsound-guided needle biopsy. Her onc is great,  but he's been away so we've been waiting for information. By next week he should have all of the results: bone scan and biopsy. Praying for a real Christmas miracle!",

I swear I have aged 20 years in this past month since that first scan at the emergency room! He asked her how her pain was and when she let him know that the pain is considerably better and that there is no swelling left on the clavicle except for the bone appearing a smidge bigger than the other side, he asked her \"Why? How could that be?\". He's as perplexed as we are it seems! He didn't say anything about her bone scan results, but if he is still \"concerned\" about what is causing those 3 lytic lesions I am guessing that the bone scan showed something as well. I don't even know if we should be happy that the lymph node biopsy didn't show anything. When my mom asked if that was good all he had to say was that it didn't tell him anything about the bone lesions. Well, then why did they biopsy it to begin with if it wouldn't show bone mets?

Almost two years ago my left breast had areas of density not seen on the previous mammogram. After a CEDM and ultrasound they chalked it up to fibrocystic changes and told me that my weight loss was likely the cause. I have lost around the same amount of weight again so am hoping it's the same. I've been told that this particular radiologist is very thorough and overly cautious, especially in women with a family history.",

My mom's treatment out here has been pretty stellar thanks to an amazing oncologist who has cared for her since her original diagnosis. He may not be the chattiest of oncs and may have the kind of demeanor that puts some people off, but he is thorough and persistent and if it wasn't for him we would have probably accepted her first few negative biopsies and not gotten her the treatment she needed. Alberta is beautiful! I used to be a flight attendant and spent quite a bit of time in different parts of your province. Always a great time :) Alyon - My mom was diagnosed Stage III and went 11 years before her cancer mets appeared. Hers also seemed to come out of the blue. She had no history of breast cancer in the family (one possible ovarian cancer in an aunt) and she had regular mammograms which were fine. We believed that since she had gone a decade without recurrence that she was in the clear. Not so. It seems to be a crapshoot though as some go so long without a recurrence, some never have a recurrence, and then others with a good prognosis find themselves with a recurrence months later. We just don't know and have to realize that worrying about it doesn't help and only takes away from enjoying life and those we love. I know it's easier said than done, but like Michael J. Fox once said:  \"If you imagine the worst case scenario and it happens, you've lived it twice.\" Now, onto a question from my mom that I am hoping one of you can answer: She had a good CT scan in July and the onc has ordered an MRI (she hasn't had one yet, only CTs and bone scans). He said it's \"just to get another look and to have it on file\". Naturally, that worries us! But what my mom wants to know is how long does an MRI of the thorax and spine take? She is somewhat clausterphobic but refuses to take sedatives or any kind of anxiety medication and is planning to just suck it up and get through it. She is still having her cough and isn't sure she will be able to stay still because of it. Has anyone had one of these and have an idea how long she will be in the machine?  ((Hugs for you all))",

      "Content": "Jun 24, 2013 10:02AM - edited Jun 24, 2013 10:12AM by GoldenGirls Hello all. My question is for those with bone mets. Does new pain always mean progression? My mom was diagnosed a few months back with mets in her clavicle bone, T5, L3, L5, sacrum, and illiac. She had rads to the clavicle (for pain) and the T5 (to avoid further damage/compression). She has been on Exemestane (generic Aromasin) since February and monthly Aredia for her bones. Other than hot flashes and joint pains from the meds, she has been feeling great...until this past week. She is having low back pain that she describes as feeling like severe muscle pain as well as shoulder pain. We don't know if this could be from the mets or something else entirely as it feels different from the pain she was having when first diagnosed. Her shoulder only hurts when she tries to lift her arm, though if she \"pushes the joint\" she can lift it all the way without pain. As for her back, she flopped down on the couch last week and felt a VERY sharp pain that only lasted a few seconds down in her lower back. For the next few days the pain was on both sides of her lower back and bad on sitting an standing but fine otherwise. Now she only feels it when she turns over in bed. Advil makes the pain in the back and shoulder much better, but doesn't take it away completely. It sounds like progression, doesn't it? She's had odd aches and pains in her joints and muscles since starting treatment and they last a couple of days and go away. These are different in that they feel better than they did when they began, but don't seem to be stopping. She is scheduled for her first scan in a couple of weeks and will see the onc on July 12th to find out if the meds are working. He is booked and not likely able to take her sooner so she is starting to really stress about the pain and wanted insight from others with bone mets, if possible. Sorry for the long post!",

She was diagnosed with lung and brain mets a few months back and was told by one doctor that she would be gone by October. She had brain radiation and had been feeling great until this past few weeks. She now has blood clots in her lungs and has just started chemo -- though I don't know the specifics about the cause of the clots, whether it was the chemo or cancer. She is having a very hard time, is on full-time oxygen, and feeling like this is the end. The onc she has been seeing for treatment was a little more hopeful and is treating the cancer. That's all i really know so far. What I am wondering is if anyone with lung mets has has had blood clots and been on oxygen and then responded well to treatment. She and her family worry that this is the end because of what the original doctor said and because of the way she is feeling from the clots they don't see how things can get better. Is it possible to come back from this and still respond well to treatment?",

I know some of you ladies have been following along with my posts and a couple have messaged me about her situation so here's what happened. - Extremely painful shoulder and swollen clavicle - the size of a tennis ball with extra swelling around it. - Emergency dept. xrays and bloodwork all clear, but doctor was convinced the swollen clavicle must be a tumor because of my mom's history of cancer so she ordered a CT scan the next day. Scan came back showing 3 lytic lesions (clavicle head, sacrum, illiac bone) and a couple other things that apparantly are of no concern even though the ER doctor told us with absolute certainty that my mom is \"full of cancer\" and that it can't be anything else causing those lesions. - Onc examines her the following week and is perplexed by the swelling and the fact that she had this same thing--though not as severe--happen a few months earlier and resolve itself. Also surprised by her clear xray and blood work. - Ultrasound done on the swollen clavicle and surrounding area - ends up showing nothing not even the soft tissue denisty originally reported in CT scan. - Had bone scan done, not sure about the specifics of the results yet but onc says his concern is only the 3 lytic lesions so I am guessing they showed up on the bone scan. - Biopsy is done on a slightly swollen supraclavicular lymph node on the opposite side of her swelling which also happens to be the side of her original breast cancer 11 years ago. Results found nothing wrong. So the onc called her last night to let her know that she will be going for a bone biopsy to try to figure out the cause of those 3 lytic lesions. He is not concerned by anything else on that original CT scan (3mmx6mm lung nodule and sclerotic lesion in pelvis area). I think it's good news that the lymph node was clear and that whatever is going on in the clavicle bone hasn't affected the soft tissue like they originally suspected,right? I just thought that between the CT, Xray and bone scan that they would have a better idea as to whether or not those lytic lesions are malignant especially since I know that many of the ladies here had their bone mets diagnosed with only scans and not a biopsy. This is nuts!",

I am a little hopeful based on the onc not just calling it mets based on the CT and bone scan since so many women here seem to have had their mets diagnosed without a bone biopsy and only based on their scan findings. I had asked the tech on the day of the bone scan whether or not they could tell the difference between bone mets and something like arthritis or degenerative disease and she said that most of the time the difference is easy to see, but that in some cases they can look similar so they compare them to other images, like a CT or MRI. When I asked about biopsy, she said that if they aren't sure after comparing scans, which doesn't happen often, then they would go with a biopsy. Fingers crossed!",

The report and diagram suggested that it follows a pattern along the same side of the body when it is cells that have spread from the original cancer.",

She was switched from Aredia for her bones to Zometa because of side effects (lingering flu-like symptoms that lasted up to 10 days after the infusion) and has felt better and doesn't feel the cough is related to the switch because it began the day before her first Zometa.

She had her first breast cancer diagnosis over 11 years ago and never thought it would come back and it was definitely far from her mind when we went to the ER for shoulder pain. The swelling going away has made her feel even more like this can't possibly be cancer again, but when she moves the wrong way and has a sharp pain across the shoulder the reality comes back all over again.

She started eating more, including eating even when she wasn't hungry. She increased her intake of red meat and started eating cereal every morning that was high in iron. I don't recall the specific cereal she was eating, but after reading labels she found one that had 50 percent of the recommended daily intake per serving.

I am especially confused about the information out there about risk because they refer to a higher risk if my mom was under 50 (she was barely 51 when dx) and if premenopausal (she had a hysterectomy a few years early, but if going by the other women in the family would likely not have been menopausal yet if not for the hysterectomy). Watching her get diagnosed a late stage 3 even with regular screening only to have it spread to bones and nodes 11 years later has made me see my own breasts as ticking time-bombs. I have issues with uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts and have been told most of my life to consider a hysterectomy after the age of 40, which I turned recently. I have decided to pursue that but it's in the back of my mind that my mom's BC came after her hysterectomy even though I keep reading that premenopausal women with BC benefit from being forced into menopause. I would like to have a prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction as well, but can't afford to do it if it won't be covered by OHIP. If anyone knows of any loopholes they'd be much appreciated!",

I check  my breasts weekly so I am pretty confident that it hasn't been there more than a couple of months--or at  least I couldn't feel it before then. Saw the doctor today and he told me he felt something without my having to tell him where it was and sure enough, it's the same thing i felt. He did say it's somewhat concerning and asked the nurse to book me an appt. for an ultrasound, which I was fully expecting when I walked in. What worried me is that he specifically asked her to book it at the hospital instead of in-house (they have an ultrasound clinic on-site). I guess this means if the ultrasound is suspicious then I can have a mammogram there also. I am beyond stressed and now am wondering about every last little thing I have been feeling, like a tingles/pins and needles sensation i have been feeling in my back and inside of my arm (same side as the lump) and a pain just to the left of my spine.  I have asked about a voluntary mastectomy several times and am always brushed off because my mom was \"officially\" diagnosed with cancer at 50. Apparantly if she were under 50 I would be considered higher risk even though the lump WAS there when she was 49--possibly even before! Anyone else have a hard line near the nipple? Imagine a hard vein or a hard duct. A little background: I am 40, no kids and therefore not nursing. I have very lumpy breasts and my left breast has been notably bigger than my right for the last 4 or so years. All mammograms have been normal so far. Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013. She passed away from complications from bone metastases Dec 2016. Log in to post a reply",

At just over 96, my grandmother who was raised in a tiny village in Portugal has never had an overnight stay in a hospital except to give birth to my mom and my uncle. She worked like a horse most of her life. She eats thick white toast with loads of margarine and a cup of coffee for breakfast, a HEAPING plate of fried everything for lunch - french fries, fried sausage, fried eggs and even dips a piece of bread in the oil in the pan to \"add flavor\" to it! She washes it down with a beer mug full of red wine--sometimes more and then eats cake or pastries for dinner with more coffee. After dinner she also enjoys a nightcap of whisky or some sweet liqueur and will have another cookie or pastry if she's up late. She stays up late and wakes up early. She won't say no to chips or booze and at well under 5 feet tall, she weighs about 140lbs most of which she carries in her waistline and belly. She has never had a mammogram or pelvic exam EVER and other than the occasional bought of high blood pressure, which seems to be brought on by imaginary arguments with my dead grandfather, she has never been on any meds or suffered from any medical conditions... unless you count the antibiotics for an infected blister she got from wearing a pair of tight new high heels, which she still rocks on a daily basis! She travels to her country and back here to Canada every summer for 4 months by herself and does all of her own cooking and cleaning. I often wonder what disease lurks in her body, especially when I see her ginormous breasts -- one of which is considerably bigger than the other and always has been - at least in my lifetime. I have heard her tell the story of the \"big bump\" she had cut open and drained after giving birth to my uncle and how it never troubled her again and wonder if it was cancer. It was close to 60 years ago and there were no biopsies or any of that where she lived. She was awake for the process and not given any medication and instead held down by 2 other nurses to keep her still while the doctor cut it open. Maybe ignorant bliss is the way to go for some. Every little ache or pain has always been brushed off by her as age or not a big deal. Who knows what's going on in that body, but at 96+ and still going strong after doing all of the wrong things, she is described by every doctor she meets as \"walking miracle\".",

She seemed to fixate on my mom's previous cancer as soon as she found out about it,  but I'm pretty sure had my mom gone in for shoulder pain and swelling and not mentioned her previous cancer, then the xrays that were \"totally clear\" would have resulted in her being sent home with some pain killers instead of a CT scan. The doctor was very negative and even though the initial xrays were \"all clear\" she told us she thought there must be a tumor somewhere just because she learned of my mom's previous diagnosis -- this based on a clear xray and no CT yet at that point. These past 3 days have been rough and I imagine the next 3 till we see the onc will also be pretty crappy, but will continue to do my best to hold it together for her. It's just hard to see her so scared and uncertain as well as in very bad shoulder pain -- which the doctor never did give her a prescription for! Grrrr!",

There was also mention that the clavicle swelling could be from a damaged lymph node but they weren't sure. The doctor went on to give her 2 cents and say that she \"doesn't believe it can be mets from a cancer from 11 years ago so it must be all new cancers, maybe even myeloma (?) or possibly lymphoma\"! I understand that BC could come back after this many years and does for many! She got quite defensive when i mentioned having read on several occasions that CT scan alone was not the best way to dx bone mets and that since they all appear to be in joints could it possibly be my mother's degerative disease showing up.

I was wondering if you have any thoughts/opinions on this confusing report which I have written out word-for word and right down to the question marks they used in the conclusion: #1- Lytic lesion right head of clavicle, soft tissue density. Invades prox. right sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 other lytic lesions in right sacrum + illiac bone. Left sclerotic lesion. #2- Mild non-specific lymphadenopathy #3- 6x3mm oblong lung nodule #4 -No source seen. Conclusion: 3 lytic lesions --> one in right clavicular head causing expansion and assoc. soft tissue density. DDX: mets, myeloma, ? other? Consider biopsy and bone scan.",

She only went in because of swelling and pain in the clavicle bone after having pulled her arm funny while lifting boxes. She looks and feels fine. She did 5 years Tamoxifen and then 5+ years on Femara which she just stopped taking last January. Could stopping the meds be the reason it's back??

Have been trying to stay positive and it helps reading all the stories here, but I can see that my mom (who doesn`t use the internet) feels like she`s on borrowed time. She watched my father go from seemingly healthy to dying from cancer within a couple of months and even though the situation was entirely different (inoperable large primary brain tumor that was caught very late), that is what she associates stage 4 with and until the onc tells her otherwise she is in a pretty dark place and only trying to hold it together for everyone else. it breaks my heart. The onc received the CT scan report from the hospital but has asked for a disc to review the actual images himself. I am not sure how accurate the report is seeing as how it`s a small town hospital Emergency Room that ordered the CT because of her shoulder pain. The xrays were completely clear and then all of a sudden a doctor who very clearly had little knowledge of cancer and mets was very negatively fixating on the report that said the \"lesions are consistent with breast cancer metastases\" (She thought \"it's not possible for breast cancer to spread after 11 years cancer-free, must be all new cancers\") A part of me hopes it's all a mistake and the lesions are degerative joint disease or something else instead...even though I know that's a long shot. :( Now we just wait some more. My poor mom doesn't even want to decorate her house for Christmas \"in case she's not here anymore\". *sigh* Gonna keep sharing all of your stories and trying to keep her as positive as I can.

So the latest in the saga: The oncologist wrote the requisition for a biopsy of a tiny lymphnode on the left side just as a place holder to get the ball rolling on a biopsy date for my mom. (Her swollen clavicle is on the right side) He said that he would likely call the hospital to switch the location of the biopsy once he had a chance to see the original CT images himself and would base the biopsy on that. We went in for her biopsy today and they biopsied the lymph node on the left. She confirmed with the doctor performing the biopsy that this was right and explained what the onc had said and he assured her that whatever is on the right side is \"unrelated\" to the biopsy he was performing on the left! I called the hospital back and explained what was going on and asked for clarification since my mom's English isn't great and they informed me that the oncologist did indeed send in a new requisition asking for the left biopsy because the ultrasound they performed the week before on the on the right side where the large lump over the clavicle was turned up nothing!! How confusing!!!!!!!! I understand that the original CT showed a lytic lesion in the clavicle with associated soft tissue density and the doctor was concerned about the possibility of a tumor. The ultrasound showed nothing. I know that ultrasounds don't pick up bones, but is it good news that there is no actual soft tissue tumor or enlarged lymph node on the side they were most concerned about?? Her onc is away until next week so we still don't know what the deal is with those suspicious lytic lesions they found. So confusing and frustrating!",

Her new pain meds made her feel sick and barely touched the pain and she ended up taking her pain meds to close together because of the bad pain that she ended up ODing which causes dizziness, extreme fatigue, and vomiting. After rads she was too tired to do anything and just feeling terrible and this was even before starting her new chemo. Turns out the rads to the pelvis very commonly cause anemia so on top of everything else her counts dropped considerably which explained the extreme fatigue. Slowly but surely she's gotten back to feeling better again. Have they checked your blood recently? Anemia can cause extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, GI issues, heart palpitations...all kinds of symptoms. Hope your onc is able to get to the bottom of it for you.",

It doesn't stay in the same place for longer than 7-10 days and never returns to the same place twice. We have found one other woman who had the same reaction to Aredia and Zometa and her pains finally resolved around 2 months after stopping bisphosphonates. Hoping my mother's pain lets up soon as the oncologist doesn't feel it's from progression because of the pattern/type of pain. We didn't see the report itself and were just told that he finds the \"partially collapsed vertebrae concerning\". He said that there could be other causes for it as well though given her age and her 12 years on hormonals. We have just never heard of a scan looking like so much progression that isn't actually progression and wondered if this is something others have experienced. She just got an appt for a bone density test yo check for osteoporosis too. Hopefully that will give us some more insight.",

She's been having bloating and feeling very full with even the tiniest amount of food. She's lost weight and has pain in her right side, closer to the back just below her last rib. It hurts when you press it and she says it feels like a pulled muscle, but it's not easing up. She was borderline anemic before she started a new chemo last week and had just completed 10 rads to sacrum and L1. The weight loss and loss of appetite can definitely be from the anemia, but the pain and bloating has me very concerned. All of the other pain she was experiencing from her bone mets disappeared the day before starting her new chemo (go figure!) but this one in her side and back remains as does the bloating, burping, feeling full, etc.",

The bone scan report said that there appears to be significant progression with uptake in various spots throughout the body where there was no activity before. (Is this what tumour flare is?) The CT scan indicated that there was significant bone loss in the T10 that wasn't there before but her lymph nodes are stable, and that's it. He told us that the activity in the bones on the scan could be the result of the zometa and that bone scans can't be relied on because many things look like cancer on them. His only real concern was the change in the T10 and he told us that if she was experiencing pain in that area he would be more compelled to think it was the cancer, but with her nodes and tumor markers stable and her lack of pain there that he can't say for sure there's progression because bone mets are tricky and imaging is not reliable for bone mets. He said it's possible that her age (63) and treatment could be causing osteoporosis and that the t10 could be the result of that. He also told her what he said at the start of all of this last year - that he would go by her nodes (which regressed after the start of treatment and are stable), by her blood work, and by her symptoms, as well as any changes in nodes or progression to organs on her CT scans and MRIs. She is still having severe pain even though it's been 7 weeks since her last zometa which seems to be the cause of her pain and he doesn't want to stop her current treatment (aromasin) if it's still working, which he feels it is. Does this make any sense? I tend to ramble. What we want to know is if anyone else has experienced/been told that more spots on the bone scan are the result of treatment working or from zometa and not progression...even though the scan looks like it is? * I should add that I am probably not explaining this all that well and that her onc is head of oncology and cancer research at the cancer centre. He has also been her onc since her original dx 12 years ago. He has been on the money with everything, including persisting on getting a dx of mets even when multiple biopsies came back negative.

We have found a small handful of other women with pain this bad, but her low back pain in particular has me thinking perhaps a fracture or something as it's coming on 9 days without any relief at all even with pain meds. It's definitely not the injection site and all of these pains have consistently come on a few days after the injections with each loading dose. The onc told her they would improve and the travelling pains all seem to pass within a couple of days, so this lingering lower back pain could very well be something else. Hopefully we will know more today or at least be able to get something better for the pain. My mother tends to turn down prescriptions for stronger medication and not take the ones she is given because she doesn't like to feel sleepy and most meds do that to her. She has finally agreed to listen to the doctor and take what she needs to in order to be comfortable. If these turn out to be side effects, she says she still prefers to stick with Faslodex and not waste an option as long as whatever they give her can help control the pain. We shall see.

He will be discussing her option with her at the end of January unless she needs to see him before then for any other issues or worsening of pain.",

They gave her Zometa yesterday immediately after the high levels of calcium were found. She has been on Faslodex for the past 2 months after being stable on chemo. She was having bad back pain for a couple of weeks so her scans were moved up. CT showed mets still stable but I guess the blood says otherwise. She is now going back to chemo next week. That's all we know so far. I wasn't with her at the appointment to ask questions. Edited to add: The oncologist told her she would get two infusions of the same chemo she was recently on in order to stabilize the cancer and then they would discuss the next treatment. As far as I know he didn't say that she was nearing the end or anything along those lines. I don't know how mild or severe it is because I didn't see the numbers. After reading more about it I am very worried! She is in good spirits with no symptoms other than the back pain which was originally thought to be from the Faslodex since it's a fairly common side effect. ",

She started her Faslodex loading doses just over a week ago and is due for the next this week. She already had her usual dry chemo cough from the chemo she finished 6 weeks ago, but the Faslodex made it worse it seems. It's a dry cough that worsens when she speaks but seems to be finally improving. The cough led her to the urgent care clinic where all tests came back fine (chest xray, EKG, blood cultures). They put her on an antibiotic just in case it was the start of some sort of respiratory infection. The problem is that her oncologist is out of the country and the onc that his nurse consulted with isn't sure if my mom should get her next round of Faslodex this week or postpone it until next week when the oncologist is back. Turns out no one--not the on-call onc, nurse, or pharmacy--can confirm whether or not it is safe to take Faslodex while on an antibiotic. (It's still relatively new here in Canada). They're also not completely sure if the cough is from Faslodex, though they do know it can be a side effect. They've left it up to my mother how to proceed. Has anyone experienced cough with Faslodex? Also, has anyone been on antibiotics when getting Faslodex? Mom was originally dx in 10/2001. Mets to bones and 2 supraclavicular nodes in 01/2013.

I'll let her know that you've been on antibiotics while on Faslodex with no issues.

The doctor was stumped the moment we told him that the CT scan done last week showed possible mets and he refused to do even look at her shoulder until he got the report from the other hospital. We made it very clear that we know the onc will fill us in on the diagnosis, etc and that we really just wanted to do something about her pain as she can now not even lift her arm or even get dressed by herself -- a big change from just 2 days ago. After finally getting a copy of her CT report, he went on and on about what \"bad news\" the results are and kept saying \"This is a big deal, it's really bad, I hope you understand that\". I think he was expecting us to have a worse reaction even though I kept explaining that we had already heard all of this and it was her pain we wanted to treat. He scolded us about how he was not going to prescribe and endless supply of pain pills and that our family doctor would since \"an oncologist cannot prescribe pain pills or help with pain management\". (News to me!!) I asked if the lesion in the clavicle bone could lead to a break in the next couple of days and he said \"of course it can -- it's eating away at her bones and muscles!!!\" So, after making my mom feel like this is the end, he finally prescribed pain meds. I did get a copy of the CT report from last week and am confused. They told us it could be mets or myeloma or some other neoplasmic disease and that the onc would have to diagnose. This is what was found: #1- Lytic lesion right head of clavicle, soft tissue density. Invades prox. right sternocleidomastoid muscle and 2 other lytic lesions in right sacrum + illiac bone. Left sclerotic lesion. #2- Mild non-specific lymphadenopathy #3- 6x3mm oblong lung nodule #4 -No source seen. Conclusion: 3 lyric lesions --> one in right clavicular head causing expansion and assoc. soft tissue density. DDX: mets, myeloma, ? other? Consider biopsy and bone scan.   Any thoughts? Help?

She says it was well past a 10 on the pain scale yesterday and that today, as long as she doesn't move the arm it's more like a 4. When she did try to lean or lie back on the bed she said it was pretty bad, though still not quite like yesterday. It's really getting her down though, as you know since you have it too.

At this point we don't even know what his take was on the original CT that was ordered by the doctor in the emergency dept when this all started or what his thoughts are on any of the other testing done. All we know is that her 2 biopsies were negative. My mom is willing to proceed with an open (surgical) biopsy if needed and he is also thorough enough that he will likely suggest further testing. She had a scare a few years back with suspicious spots on her liver on an ultrasound. He immediately sent her for a CT which showed nothing, but still wanted to be certain and also sent her for an MRI, which thankfully was also clear. I am happy to say that he isn't the type to let something go unless he is very confident in what he has found. It would be nice to just take those negative results and put this all behind us, but I am far too aware of the consequences of missing something and don't want my mother to wake up one day with no options because things are too far gone.

The lump wasn't visible on the mammo but it did show a growing area of asymmetry that was not present before along with some mildly prominent ducts. I was told that the asymmetry means that there is an area of increased density that could be hiding something or it could just simply be the result of overlapping tissue because the breast wasn't compressed enough. The ultrasound was clear. I went in for a mammogram with contrast today and am an absolute wreck. I was in tears after being asked about the recent death (from BC) of my mother and told the tech how nerve-wracking this whole experience has been and she said she would take a peek at the images and let me know if anything was highlighted. When she came back into the room she apologized and said she changed her mind because she didn't want to say things were fine in case they weren't. Now I'm even more terrified! It sounds like you too have an area of more density that doesn't have the characteristics of a mass but needs more investigation to be sure. That's my take on it anyway. Hopefully someone like DJMammo (retired radiologist) or another member with more experience will chime in and offer his insight. Will keep my fingers crossed for benign biopsy result for you this Thursday. Hugs",

I'm usually the tough as nails one and often feel bad for not being more emotional or seeming more compassionate. It was easier to deal with her initial diagnosis because we were given the \"all clear\" very quickly. It's different when you know that there is no going back with this stage. I know it's not a death sentence, but my mind seems to keep going there! My mom doesn't use the internet and really doesn't know much about cancer and how things can be managed. I have been telling her about all of you and what you have said and letting her know that there are women who live very normal lives for many years, and though I know it helps to hear it, I can still see the fear and uncertainty and it's breaking my heart. Why does bad news always seem to come on Fridays? We can't even speak to he oncologist until Monday. All we know is that the ER doctor sent all of the reports to his practice as well as to his hospital office (he is head of oncology in a city 2 hours away where we use to live). I know it'll be easier to handle when we know more and know how we are going to proceed. I really hope he is able to see her quickly. Part of me is still praying that the lesions they found are degenertive disease as she does have that in multiple joints and all of the bone lesions found were on joints. They weren't able to determine what's going on in the lung except that there is an \"oblong non-specific nodule 3mm by 4mm that requires further investigation\". i know that other conditions can be mistaken for bone mets and I don't understand how none of these showed up in her initial xrays or even in her bone density test 3-4 months ago which, according to the ER doctor, \"should have at least caught the one in her hip if it was there at the time\". Thank you again to all of you! If anyone has any great stories about living with mets I would really appreciate it. I would love to be able to print some off and give them to my mom to read to keep her spirits up until she has more information. xo",

It has since gotten worse. She describes it as a dull ache in the middle of her shoulder blade that she can feel all the way up her neck to her head. I asked if it's worse with movement and she said the neck pain is, but the shoulder blade pain is continuous and doesn't change with rest or movement or ibuprofen. We're definitely worried that something has changed since end of May. She stopped Xeloda 3 weeks ago in preparation for rads and though scans showed stable, her onc thinks the fracture in her sacrum could be the result of bone progression that isn't showing up on scans yet. They weren't going to do another scan till December, but this new pain in the shoulder blade probably should be checked out sooner. If her scans in March and May showed no organ involvement and she has a \"slow-growing cancer\", could new liver mets be causing this kind of pain already? I just figured that they'd have to be fairly large or many in number to cause pain in the shoulder. So many unknowns. *sigh*",

Needle biopsies are more likely to \"miss\" a cancer than an excisional biopsy. Having the lump removed and tested, if possible, would give you the certainty you need. I understand what you mean about wanting to accept the good news and be happy about it and still having concerns. My mom's experience with false negative biopsy results are different as she was waiting to confirm if her cancer had spread when it happened to her. She had 3 biopsies that were negative but her oncologist (highly experienced and reputable) insisted that he felt they were missing the right area. This upset us because we so badly wanted to believe that the negative results were right, but as he put it \"if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then it's probably a duck\". Thank God he persisted because my mother's cancer was indeed back. This is not to say that your mom's results are wrong, but if you are having any doubts then it is worth pushing for an excisional biopsy or a second opinion from a breast specialist. Praying that you get the answers and peace you need.",

My mom had her CT last month because of bad pain in her buttock, groin, and upper thigh that seems to come and go every few weeks and it showed she was stable. Since her pain has been a better indicator of bone mets progression in the past than her scans, the onc sent her for an MRI last week. We get the results Monday. Not sure what to expect. Her pain lasts for about 10 days, disappears completely for 3 weeks or so and then comes back. We keep telling her to take it easy to see if her activity is what's causing the pain and she's good for a couple of weeks and then gets cocky because she feels good and then goes and over does it again! This bout of pain started the day after some gardening and washing her car inside and out. Her bone mets are widespread but the most damage seems to be in the pelvis and lower back. Thinking the damage and her being too active since the weather's gotten better is responsible for her pain, but one never knows. Anyway, all prayers and good vibes welcome!

He has sent her for radiation to the sacrum and lower spine and will re-scan her after rads before deciding if she will switch treatments. So the news is confusing, but we're still hanging onto the fact that 5 scans in the past 6 months still show stable. I know bone mets are hard to track on scans of any kind, but fingers are still crossed. Unfortunately, we had a not so great experience at the cancer center we were sent to for radiation. The radiation oncologist and his nurse were both incredibly negative. Okay, more like the angels of death! My mother, until this fracture and resulting pain episode, has not been on any pain meds in the 3 years since her stage IV dx. Even now, she's content taking Advil when she does have pain. This sent the nurse into a fit! She lectured us about the severity of her cancer and talked over her when my mother tried to explain that she'd been pretty much pain free up until this. The nurse repeatedly said \"You NEED to understand that you have metastatic disease and it is only getting worse\". She also kept talking about how she should \"take something at night because cancer hurts more at night and not sleeping isn't helping anyone\" -- this even though my mother repeatedly told her that she actually feels better at night because she is not putting any weight on the hip/leg and therefore sleeps great. It was infuriating! Then the rad onc came in, and while very friendly, he too jumped to conclusions about my mother's pain and ability to live her daily life, even saying to her that she needs to put her mother (my grandmother who lives with her) in a home. I swear he was on the verge of suggesting hospice or some kind of facility for my mother until we both jumped in and informed him that my grandmother is entirely self-sufficient and doesn't actually require my mom's physical care. If anything having my grandmother with her has been a great help because she cooks and helps with basic things so my mom can rest her hip. My mother also had to remind him several times that until this fracture, she's been very active and feeling great. She felt dismissed and completely misunderstood because the nurse and onc both made the assumption that her extensive mets mean she must be completely incapacitated and on her last leg. Did I mention she still only has bone mets as of last scan? I wanted to grab their tongues to stop them from saying anything else and actually listening to us! It seems that not being in hysterics gave them the impression that we don't understand the severity of her disease. Jeez. An infuriating experience that we'll try to put behind us as she starts her radiation next week. Wishing everyone great results!",

Other than leg pain from hip damage that will be getting rads soon too, her symptoms have all resolved so hoping that's good news. At last scan the mets, though extensive, were still just in bones, but some symptoms that started between scans and before rads and new treatment seemed (I think) like those related to liver mets so we're especially on edge about these results. If stable she will get one more chemo tomorrow and then get a \"break\" from AC and finally be able to get rads to that hip. Fingers and toes crossed!",

Today we get the results of my mother's latest scan to see if her current chemo is still working and her MUGA results after she began showing some signs that could possibly indicate a heart issue. She's been having trouble getting her counts up too, even with an extra week between cycles, so she's also having blood work to see how her counts are after having had another transfusion (2 units) with her last chemo. Our concern is that even though the mets are still contained to the bone with no organ involvement, the effect of the chemo may limit her options. The good thing is that aside from swollen ankles and legs, she feels fantastic. Her pain has always been the best indicator of progression, so at least there's that. On top of all of that, my husband has a very enlarged inguinal node and no sign of infection that might have been the cause, so he is now scheduled for an excisional biopsy to try to rule out lymphoma or other type of malignancy. He's had some imaging done in the meantime to look for other enlarged nodes or possible problems, but they won't give us the results until his pre-surgical appointment next week. So frustrating! If only they served wine in this virtual waiting room! My thoughts to anyone waiting on results.",

She cut it down considerably all on her own while still in rehab for her leg and her nurses had no clue. She cut even further during her last week there and that's when the extreme fatigue, mood swings and dizziness began. I guess I'll have to be a tatletail and tell on her when we see the oncologist!",

A few weeks back she took it upon herself to cut down her dose without consulting the doctor who was in the process of weaning her off of them properly. Around the same time she began to experience extreme fatigue and started getting lightheaded/dizzy on standing every now and again and it got even worse when she cut her dose down further. A few days back she added back the dose that she'd most recently cut and by the next morning her fatigue had improved greatly and for a couple of days had no lightheaded/dizzy spells at all. Today they are back and still only happen on standing once in a while. She doesn't see her onc until next week and has so far refused to let any of her doctors know that she's been messing with the dose on her own.
