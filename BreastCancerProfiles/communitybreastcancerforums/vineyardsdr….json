I can still here my surgeon's voice,\"you don't know what you have till it is held in your hand\".Â  I am having my 5th surgery next Friday. I am scared for some reason this time.

But knowing it is no longer in my body gives me great peace, regardless of what it turns out to be. Please don't wait.",
