Your strength and resolve is truly impressive and I appreciate your insight. I'm looking for help to recognize any subtle warning signs of a potentially worsening condition. I understand this is not to be taken as medical advise. On Thanksgiving I felt a sharp stinging in my right nipple and it just started bleeding. It was bleeding from 4 ducts and I had to press for a while to get it to stop. I've started the physician treadmill and had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound which was negative. I saw a breast surgeon today as well; but I feel like I'm being dismissed with a pat on the head. I think I should be happy for the negative tests, but I'm growing more concerned. I understand the literature on benign papilloma's and that's the direction the doctors were looking. My concern is that the same itching and tingling sensations started in the other breast last week and it feels like my lymph nodes are burning on both sides, although that sensation comes and goes. This week my ovaries started to feel sore and swollen, but the BS said it's completely unrelated.  The BS tried to reproduce the bleeding, but couldn't. He said this was probably a one-time occurrence and that it's probably not going to happen again.  He said if the bleeding was steady (without stopping) then that would be of concern. The fact that he couldn't reproduce it made him think it was a one-off.  I asked for an MRI but felt uncomfortable since he was sending me home with a \"good report\". My father had Paget's, and it metastasized outside of the mammary glands. Of course I shared this with all the health care professionals and they were alert to the implications. I'm trying to remain objective, but I can't ignore what I feel going on inside. I'm wondering if my symptoms are familiar to someone who is willing to share their path to diagnosis. Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
