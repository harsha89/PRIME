I'm only a stage 1b, my oncologist said it doesn't necessarily go by the stage but age. I have a larger increase due to being so young. It's been some stuides that's suggested 10 years is better than 5 & it's needed due to the first 10 years is the highest chance of reacurrance. I'm not sure how true that statement is so please don't quote me on it. I read a study at my cancer center. Some people it causes horrible side effects but I was warned we would work with any side effect because this medicine is the best chance at a lesser reacurrance. I'm only a stage 1a, onco score of 14, 9% reacurrance rate. I did have 5 cm of DCIS, and 3 other masses the largest of the invasive was 2.9 cm. Hope this helps, SA",

It's part of the MX law! Ask your doctor for prescriptions for them. I use a breast cancer supply store. It would had been 696.00 but insurance covered all! I just started being able to wear my bra & forms.also you get new ones every 3 months! YES every 3 months! I'm 31 it felt odd and uncomfortable, I couldn't wait to get home and remove it. I do have the chance to complete a reconstruction, I've just had so many complications from my BMX (double). I'm having issues getting my shirts to fit properly. Any ideas on what to wear or try, favorite designer for ladies with a MX? I also have brand new camisoles with bulit in drains, I have 2 of them one I tried on and it was way too small they wouldn't let me exchange I would love to give them to someone who needs them they are large & white but fit snug like a medium. I also have a brand new lace bra with the breast forms anyone can have it's brand new never used. I will ship them for free to any of my lovely sisters on here! Just send me a PM with your name and address. Best wishes to all Sa",
