I'm experiencing pretty regular hand, foot and back pain and leg pain too. Is this a normal side effect of chemo / tratment? Has anyone had similar? Would really appreciate some feedback.

      "Content": "LouiseIndigo wrote: Hi there. I have mets to my spine, which popped up 6 months after finishing initial treatment of mastectomy, chemo and rads. While it has been tough to deal with, the one thing that gives me real hope, encouragement and which i find personally empowering is exercise -- aerobic, core training and weights. I am not a normal gym bunny and spent my twenties and thirties doing no exercise at all. I am now 43. Although i have read a significant number of research reports that suggest that exercise impacts positively on both survival and progression, my medical people never suggest it as a good idea/otherwise. It doesn't seem to exist as an option for someone at \"my stage\" -- certainly not a recommended one. Maybe we are supposed to find out these things for ourselves? Maybe medics think it would put us under too much pressure to suggest it? Maybe they simply don't think exercise is appropriate now? Or maybe it simply doesn't even enter their heads to talk about it because they are medics and not fitness instructors and cross disciplinary or holistic treatment is far too 22nd century to enter the equation?! I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Louise Log in to post a reply",
