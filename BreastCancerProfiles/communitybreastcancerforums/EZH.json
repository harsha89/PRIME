Dearest ladies newly diagnosed and not yet staged:  when you mercifully, finally, (waiting is hell) get your surgery and get your nodes checked, you will have a lot more information.  Then, you and your onc. will come up with the game plan and then, trust me here, you will really feel sooo much better.  The panic will slowly subside and you'll do what needs to be done. And you will grow stronger and calmer.  Things will not ever be the same, but there will be a new, less panicky \"normal\".  My personal experience includes lumpectomy, bilateral mastectomy, offerectomy, chemo. and now Arimidex....some days are better than others but all days are better than the waiting and not knowing place that you all are in right now. It was hard for me to even breathe during that time. Sending you all warm hugs, and if I could send you each a Xanax, I would do that, too! ",
