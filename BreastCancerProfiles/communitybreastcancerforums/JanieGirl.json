I have done physical therapy for 8 months now with no relief. I seem to have more pain when not moving. The pain is in my neck, shoulder and ribs. I have noticed in the last couple months that my hips now hurt. I am not taking any medication. I have had an X-ray of my shoulder and neck, my neck showed degeneration and shoulder showed nothing. Would just like feed back before I start asking for thing like bone scans. Thanks",
