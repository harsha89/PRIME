When I was diagnosed with mets, my onc had me start the Lupron/Zoladex shots right away while we decided about the ooph. She said one benefit of that was to ease me into menopause a bit more gently than the ooph. So I did the shots for a few months before the surgery.  Another benefit of having the ovaries removed is that some clinical trials require that you are naturally or surgically postmenopausal and will exclude you if you are on Lupron/ovarian suppression. Before stage IV dx, I thought clinical trials were a last resort, but that is not the case at all. So that's another bonus!",

I was taking Femara and tumor markers were going down. Then I had a scan that showed 3 lesions in my liver that were triple negative on biopsy. I was pretty shocked as I was hoping to get some time out of the hormonals. I feel like I'm playing catch up since I know so little about TN. To echo riverhorse, my onc did say that \"turning\" triple negative is not the same as being triple negative to start. But the Ki-67 index is much higher for my triple negative tumor compared to the original so it does seem more aggressive for me. I had not had chemo in the metastatic setting, but now am doing a clinical trial at NIH in Bethesda, MD. It is carboplatin plus olaparib (an oral PARP inhibitor). I've only had 1 cycle - 1 carboplatin infusion plus 7 days of the PARP inhibitor. Will repeat every 3 weeks, get scanned every 6 weeks to see if it's working. So far it is very tolerable and I am able to work. Let me know if you want more details. I also had genetic testing of my tumor done through a trial at Hopkins (the IMAGE study). They sent the liver tumor to FoundationOne for testing. I came up with 4 mutations, but none that will dictate my treatment at this point. It is something to look into though. Also, my tumor was tested for androgen receptors and was very highly positive. I'm not sure if there is an open trial for that right now, but it's another target to consider.  Let me know if you want to chat. Wishing you all the best! ",

I had a biopsy when it spread to the liver while I was on Femara and the liver lesions were triple negative, much to my surprise. So I started a clinical trial that includes carboplatin and a PARP inhibitor (Olaparib). I have had significant shrinkage in the liver tumors on this treatment and stable elsewhere. It's definitely a good idea to get a biopsy when mets show up in a new area so you can adjust treatment as needed. Hope the biopsy goes smoothly!",
