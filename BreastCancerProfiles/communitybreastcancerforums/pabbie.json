I also wash the area gently every day with Dove Unscented soap & water. And keeping the area dry helped me with a rash I got under my breast. My radiation techs told me if my skin breaks down they would send me to the nurse in which there was something else I could use. I didn't get the name; but I would ask to see the radiation nurse or onc. Good luck, it's almost over with for you and me.",

I was given compression garments for my arm and hand and leg (from another surgery). I would use my garments to the gym to ride the bike and lift light weights throughout the year. I tried to wear my garments to work but they made me more hot. (sweat was pouring off my face) Menopause time plus tamoxifen. The job was to scan 300-500 credit-card like cards through a machine. A cashier cafeteria position. My p/t said I need to wear my glove if I'm to continue with this repetitious work. Any suggestions on how you keep cool when wearing your garments at work? And what kind of work do people do with this problem? I actually thought my lymphadema would be better in the right arm. Now I'm up a notch to stage 1-moderate.

My rad onc diagnosed me with lymphadema of the arm (she measured both arms). The only thing I noticed as far as the radiation to my tumor site was I got breast edema (right breast) and it is still there. My rad onc says 2-3 months perhaps until it goes down. I take ibuprofen for the pain and swelling.Â My arm is still numb under the arm pit. I had 2/19 nodes positive (one was the sentinel lymph node). Sometimes I think I had alot of lymph nodes taken out as opposed to others I have read. Thanks for the kind thoughts. I'm trying to put one foot in front of the other as far as getting motivated to walk. And my goal this summer is to do some water exercises in the pool. I hope you are well also. Thanks for caring.
