The plastic surgeon contacted my BS and offered to do whatever was necessary to get the TEs in place on the same day. They called me at work and have me an hour to make my decision. So I decided to go ahead with the plastics as well. I have a lot of issues with pain that is not being controlled by narcotics. I had researched marcaine pumps and requested one. The morning of my surgery the PS said he had consulted with his wife (an anesthesiologist) who suggested a paravertebral block. It was not fun but worked well for the most part. On Tuesday PS removed the marcaine pump. By Wednesday I could really tell a difference! My \"breasts\" feel like someone took my skin and sewed bricks n place. Th are hard and painful. I hope to get a call from the BS tomorrow with my patio. All I know is one of the sentinel nodes was positive and others looked swollen so she took out a chunk more. So that's my story for now",

(One BS for each side) Then there was confusion about whether the PS was actually available. Then the second BS confirmed. Ugh!! In the meantime I start looking at other ways of doing reconstruction, and I'm no longer convinced. So I made the FINAL decision to delay my reconstruction.
