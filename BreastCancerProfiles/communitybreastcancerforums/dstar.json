I use a natural calendula cream am and pm and over that a natural diaper rash cream (Welleda?) on my skin that was blasted w/ radiation to the chest wall after my Mx. when I have to go to work and wear clothing that touches my skin. It helps with the sensitivity and chaffing by providing a barrier. I moisturize (the entire chest wall, neck, arm and back so that all the skin is supple) and then stretch as the PT told me to. Plus, her nerves are all messed up. Take vits b-6 and b-12 to help w/ nerve regeneration. This was the advice of my MO. The tonic of time does help too, slowly. Plus it's a difficult transition mentally and emotionally. That can make everything feel worse. It takes buckets and buckets of patience. You are a good man. My best to you and your wife.",

I write stuff down on a list so I show up at the right time at the right place. I walk with my dog, stretch and do light strengthening exercises/ yoga. For now, I can work from home as I can. I learn about my treatment options. I eat nutritious food and visit with friends and family and sleep as much as possible. Everything else is out of my control. My friend gave me good advice, \"try to live through this only once.\" So I work on keeping my mind quiet with varying degrees of success. Sometimes I want to drink a bunch of tequila but I don't. I don't know if my rambling helps you, I hope so. This is really rough. Anxiety is a very normal response to fear. So you are OK; it is OK to feel anxiety though it is uncomfortable. Breathe deeply, sometimes it helps take the edge off.",

I REALLY liked what you said about going at this thing with all guns blazing!

But I still enjoyed Christmas and family being together. Very nice. But now it is healing and is still kind of uncomfortable but it is so much better. And it has been accessed for my scans, so much better than my arm, so totally worth it! Had a little scare that I had mets to a rib, but my onco has decided to move forward with chemo and said the area is probably not cancer but an old injury but it will need to be watched. Maybe a blast with rads when done with chemo. Had a filling replaced with a crown so new chemo start date is 1/22. Whew. Hey, JustKeepSwimming, Please join the Jan. 2015 Chemo thread if you want to. Everyone is going through exactly what you are. For me, it really helps maintain a positive perspective. Lots of great women there to keep you strong. I understand the fear and the sorrow, and you have a child so it is really scary. I was misdiagnosed as well, so my cancer grew. I cannot change that so am moving forward. Try to take it slowly, as others suggest and breathe, this is a process. You will get through it. All any of us really have is the present moment. I try to focus on things that make me happy everyday or something I am grateful for like each friend and family member who loves me or my little terrier who makes sure I get two long walks everyday. A great cup of coffee. The birds at the feeder. A big blue sky. Some days I get overwhelmed and cry when I wash the dishes, treatment can be punishing and full of loss. But those days are fewer and farther apart as time goes on. Stay in touch, don't give up, it will get better for you.",

And thanks to all for the encouragement and warmth everybody.The info about the steroid eased my mind. This is really hard for me because my mother died at my age now, 50, after a two-year-long illness caused by pancreatic cancer. I was one of her care takers, along with my father and sister. She suffered greatly but cancer treatment was really still in the dark ages then, I am realizing. What happens when you have to live through your greatest fear? Do you turn into a butterfly?",

Thanks for your understanding and kindness. . .you have certainly been on a long journey through cancer-land. I cannot imagine; you are a hero. Did you have genetic testing? Is that why you had a prophylactic mastectomy on your right breast? Can I ask you how large your tumor was? If I am being too nosy, you can tell me to stuff it. I will have genetic testing in Feb. How are you feeling now? I hope very well! In a strange way, my cancer is letting me heal from some difficult emotions that I shut away because they were too big and hard to handle when I was young. Now, they are in my face but I have more maturity, perspective and grace than I did at 17. Maybe that's the reward, processing old emotions and letting go--carrying a lighter load. Plus I read you tutorial on teas, that was great. I am drinking a lot of green tea and throwing some fresh ginger root in it. Works on nausea for me. So glad I found these boards, I cannot say. I will stay in touch. ",

Waiting to take tests and for results is so hard, I cried a lot and felt out of control sometimes. Helplessness is built in to the process, no matter how great your medical care is. I know you are scared, that is OK. Keep breathing. It is a very good thing you are getting a biopsy and genetic testing, given your family history. I don't want to alarm you but cancer that starts in the lobes (ILC) is usually irregularly shaped and more unusual, often misdiagnosed as something else, a gland, connective tissue (looks \"really funny\" an unprofessional comment at best) But this may be a benign tumor, most tumors are. Diagnosis can take a while, it is a difficult process. Try to live each day as it comes, easier said than done. A friend of mine said to me, don't live through this twice, just once. You will get though this; this is the hardest part. Once you have some real information, it will be easier. I wish you the best possible outcome. These boards are a great place to learn and a great place for support. Warm Regards, dstar.",

My biopsy was also crazy painful even with the doctor administering additional local and went slowly. 3 sample sites, 16 needles, more or less. Ouch. I had a large tumor or maybe it's something about the nature of lobular cancer that made the biopsy painful. Mastectomy with clean margins on Dec. 1. Starting to really recover from the surgery. Now in the chemo pipeline, scans, port etc. First chemo treatment Jan. 7. Still don't know if my cancer has metastasized. Hope not. Working is hard, it is difficult to concentrate. Even now it is a little easier for me although I dread chemo. It is a process of assimilating information one day at a time. I will join the lobular group. Hope we can share more of our experiences there. Just hang in there. Take a gentle walk everyday, drink lots of water, eat well, sleep as much as is possible. You are not your cancer. You are still you. If you can stay in the present then you can have today, and the pleasure of a pretty winter day or time with your children. If that doesn't work then yes, Ativan, anti-anxiety medication, taken as needed, can help you through really tough days, no shame in it, no need to white-knuckle your way through all of this. There is no benefit in that. Take good care.",
