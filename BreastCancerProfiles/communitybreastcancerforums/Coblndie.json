I had neoadjuvent care with 6 rounds of chemo I was very strong through. My EKG just came back saying I had a myocardial infarction at some point, so I'm about to go for a stress echo, although no one seems concerned about it not sure why. This surgery is throwing me for a loop...or maybe its the part that I'm almost cancer free. I'm not sure but I've had high anxiety lately....hitting me like a ton of bricks. Any advice or experience that anyone can offer me? This is done all the time, I'm not sure why i'm so nervous about it!

I can not eat, I can not sleep, I am hot, I am cold, my whole body aches. I dry heave. I am taking my meds, but I just don't feel like I can handle this. This is neoadjuvent care, so at the end of 6 sessions I'll have surgery. My Pet Scan was clear, my lymph nodes were clear, my BRCA was negative. How do you do it. I have a 7 year old. All I can do is weep and feel miserable. Please help me, and pray for me.
