      "Content": "Jul 19, 2012 09:45PM - edited Jul 22, 2012 02:05PM by chelseasanfran Yes,  I went there in early March for a two-day comprehensive consultative evaluation post-lumpectomy with Intraoperative Radiation and 4 cycles of CT for Stage IIb DC.  I completely filled out their 19 page questionnaire in advance and was scheduled to see their medical oncologist, their psychotherapist, their internist, and a nutritionist.  However, since their internist was away the week of my visit, I saw Keith Block for my physical exam and medical interview.  Although, I was very disappointed with the the care I received there, I cannot overestimate the enormous respect and appreciation I have for Keith and Penny's Block's approach, the knowledge base they have developed and so generously disseminated and their commitment to providing truly integrated conventional and complementary medicine for people with cancer.  While their services are not inexpensive, I do not think that their primary motivations are financial (in contrast to the Cancer Treatment Centers of America and many of the institutionally affiliated Complementary Medicine Centers cited below).  When I called the Cancer Treatment Centers of America and told them I had an HMO, they said they would not see me without a $250 K deposit.  The Block Center does not ask for any advance payment and is very accommodating for people who may need a payment plan. I believe Keith and Penny Block are truly committed to patients and their recovery. I also think that the Block Center is probably one of the few, if only places in the country that can give hope to late-stage cancer patients who have been abandoned by conventional medicine practitioners as hopeless.  I should also preface by saying that the Center was reportedly in chaos the week that I visited as some of their staff was on vacation and Keith was delayed on route back from a conference. With that said, I went to the Block Center for advice on whether or not to have further radiation (WBRT) in addition to a complementary medicine evaluation with treatment recommendations, i.e., diet and supplements.  My clinical history is posted on various topic groups on BC.org , but my situation was that I was post-chemo having had the wrong procedure (IORT is only for stage I).  I had been mis-staged pre-op by US biopsy, which would not have happened had I gotten a second opinion or even just had a pre-op Breast MRI. I had subsequently gotten contradictory information from the tumor board where I had my surgery recommending WBRT after chemo and other consultants and experts saying I should not.  I thought the Block Center would be the perfect place to help me address this question as well as help me with my entire care plan moving forward.   I had previously read parts of Keith's book: Life Over Cancer, which for the most part has almost all of the information that he provides in person. I first heard about him via a very rude Oncologist at the UCSF Osher Center, whom I had called for a referral for a truly integrative/ed medical oncologist in the SF Bay area after it became clear that neither the UCSF Osher Center, CPMC/Sutter Institute for Health and Healing nor the Alta Bates Center for Integrative Medicine Program actually integrates complementary approaches with conventional treatments - but rather merely provide costly adjunct/add-ons to conventional treatments that are for the most part not covered by insurance for cancer treatment. Since the complementary MDs there do not provide any conventional medical treatment or care, most insurance companies won't even cover a visit with a complementary medicine MD for a second opinion. This applies also to the Block Center, where only certain professional services, labs and treatments offered or recommended will be covered by insurance.  I should also note that my primary care doctor is an Osteopathic physician (a D.O.) and had a copy of Keith's book, which he lent me. He has also given me a lot of recommendations for supplements and herbal preparations and conferenced on my f/u call with Keith to review the labs I had done at the Block Center and goals for impacting the problematic ones, which included both cancer markers and basic ones like fasting glucose. In any case, I was very disappointed with the Block Center, even though I am still following the diet Keith recommended, am taking/purchasing from their affiliated company $800 of supplements per month that he prescribed, and am checking in with him next month on my follow-up labs and clinical status.  I just finished a very exhausting two month long six month f/u screening that was clear, but required 2 breast MRIs, 1 breast US, 1 MRI guided core biopsy, 1 US guided core biopsy, 1 abd US and 1 chest CT.  This process was started by Keith's recommendation that I alternate 6 month screenings between mammograms and Breast MRIs in part to reduce radiation exposure.  However, in this process, I have learned about all of the issues with the Breast MRI technology (see my other postings on this) and am seeking access to a more advanced Breast MRI technology for my next 6 month screening.  The problems I encountered at the Block Center included that they were very disorganized - I waited 4 hours for my first appointment with a fairly inexperienced nutritionist who hadn't even looked at my questionnaire and started reading to me from their written manual. She knew nothing about the diet I had been on since starting chemo or any of my clinical information. She also provided me recommendations regarding her own personal diet - stating that she didn't trust any meat or fish products whatsoever. She then left by giving me the supplement list and guessing/suggesting which ones I probably needed most, with the caveat that I would need to meet with Keith who would ultimately tell me which ones were essential (He basically told me all of them were essential).  A second follow-up meeting with the nutritionist that occurred b/c of my dissatisfaction with the first meeting was more productive in that she responded very professionally to a list of questions that I had given her and agreed to follow-up with me on recommendations/recipes for various dairy and protein substitutions.  When I then met with Keith, he knew little about my case, and told me neither he nor anyone on staff knew anything about radiation, but that he knew a really smart radiation oncologist somewhere in Illinois whom I should call and consult with. It turned out that the number he gave me for the Rad Onc was a number where the Rad Onc hadn't practiced for 20 years and when I did call the RO's office, I was told he doesn't take any private patients.  It took two weeks, to get a call from him and he consulted with me by phone, but I had to take copious notes and he never sent me any written report, which he promised (didn't bill me either, which I expected). My meeting with their therapist was horrendous. She started by telling me how much she admired me, how much I had accomplished, and wanted me to rehash my past family history I had mentioned in the questionnaire, which brought me to tears. I had to insist at the end of this extended  session that we focus on my problems coping in the present and how overwhelmed I was with not getting good care, having had the wrong procedure, not knowing what to do about further radiation, my side effects (I had just finished my last chemo cycle - had lost all my hair, had terrible joint and bone pain, etc) and all of the unrealistic recommendations that Dr. Block had given me to follow. I told her I needed a local referral for a good Cognitive Behavioral Therapist. She would up emailing me a useless link to a state agency that licenses psychologists. Keith's wife Penny Block subsequently referred me to a psychotherapist 3000 miles away to speak with by phone. My last meeting was with a medical oncologist who walked out to meet me in the waiting area and basically said, \"Well, I hear you have everything taken care of.\" (having seen Keith Block) and reiterated that he knew nothing about radiation. He then spent the remaining 30-40 minutes asking me professional advice and sharing with me his personal problems regarding how one of his family members didn't appreciate his interest in mindfulness practices. I had/still have a bad arthritic hip and put this down as one the issues I wanted help with.  It was only as I was leaving and made a complaint with their business manager about these and other issues, that I noted that they never really addressed my chemo symptoms and that they should have scheduled me to see their physical therapist and coordinated this with my recommended complementary treatments (They have all the PT equipment out in plain view). Two follow-up calls with Penny Block were helpful to the extent that she walked me through and sent me a fact sheet on progressive muscle relaxation, which she recommends/ed twice daily. I feel that I probably could have gotten almost everything from his book, as his main recommendations were for me to read most of his book.  However, as we all know, assimilating and applying in a practical way a diet and supplements from a book is very difficult. I have though as noted followed his diet and supplement regimen for four plus months as well as his metabolic and lab monitoring recommendations without any regular contact with him/them. I have relied mostly on personal supports and support from my primary care MD and medical oncologist.  I have lost about 18 pounds, although unable to walk very well or do regular aerobic exercise, have lost some muscle mass as well, my blood pressure, which was intermittently spiking up is back to low normal, my heart rate which was normal high is down, my fasting blood sugar is down by 10 points, all my tumor markers are down to normal/negative, and my cholesterol, which is still high due to an elevated LDL is down by 20 points. And my Vit D is up to normal (was low). Starting Aromasin has somewhat undermined how much better I was feeling, as it aggravates my joint/muscle pain, and is causing a lot of menopausal symptoms (again!) including night sweats, insomnia and hot flashes. In addition to reviewing my labs and questions about alternative treatments for the Aromasin SEs that are not estrogenic (my tumor was ER + and PR - with Keith next month, I have a lot of questions about the fact I am taking many different supplements that have varying doses of the same supplements/vitamins (e.g. four separate ones with Calcium). Some supplements have been shown to work better in certain combinations (e.g. 4:1 ratio EPA:DHA for Omega 3 FAs) with trace amounts of another substance (e.g. Omega 3s with trace amounts Vit E). However, some of the overlapping supplements don't seem justified scientifically, so I am going address these questions with him. My biggest issue though with the Block Center is that they are not truly integrative, because they don't provide all of the conventional treatments that people need with breast cancer treatment, although they do provide chemotherapy and prescribe anti-hormone medications. I think part of the problem may be that they are so progressive in approach and have stayed true to their approach, such that they remain isolated and unintegrated with an institutional cancer center.  This is unfortunate, but clearly not their fault. I also think that the demand for their services and/or cost to maintain their center independently may be so great that it has become difficult for them to adequately individualize services and treatment and to find and/or train competent professionals at their level. It also may be that the relatively low cost of the Center's services need to be subsidized by their supplement revenues, which is run by a company that reportedly has other partners/investors beyond the Block Center. ",

      "Content": "May 19, 2012 06:25PM - edited May 19, 2012 06:30PM by chelseasanfran Hi everyone,  I wanted to update you on the recent situation with my 6 month screening post-lumpectomy with Intraoperative radiation and 4 cycles chemo.  The team where I am going for a comprehensive second opinion on whether to have more radiation and where I had a second Breast MRI is having a battle among the specialists at my expense.  I was scheduled for a f/u MRI guided breast biopsy based on second Breast MRI results at their institution which showed a new mass in the breast where I had the lumpectomy and IORT.  It was cancelled at the last minute by the surgeon consultant (not the surgeon who did my lumpectomy).  This surgeon finally said he didn't do MRIs and that I didn't meet criteria for MRI screening anyway (which I have read that I do).  He said both breasts were \"fine\", that the radiologists at his institution didn't know what they were talking about, because they are not clinicians. and that I should have a 6 month f/u Mammo on the post-lumpectomy breast and a 12 month f/u Mammo on the other.  This is after he had previously told my current medical oncologist that regarding my first 6 month Breast MRI (which showed a mass in my good breast, but nothing in my post-lumpectomy breast) that he agreed with the radiologist from the other institution that did the 1st MRI that I have a f/u \"second-look\" US and an US biopsy if the US was suspicious.  I was thus really shocked when he said he would do nothing after findings on my second Breast MRI from his institution came back with opposite, but suspicious findings.  I had called him three times and asked the radiologist at his institution to have him call me over a period of two weeks. I only heard back from him when I told the scheduler I was going forward with the MRI guided breast biopsy in two days and that no one at his institution seemed to be in agreement with any of the findings or recommended f/u on the MRI from his hospital or the hospital where I had had my surgery and 1st 6 month screening MRI. I am having a follow-up US this week and will advocate for what I think makes sense based on the findings.  I think what I've come to understand is that MRI is much more sensitive, but less specific than US.  This means that while its discrimination capacity may not be very good (i.e. in discriminating between benign and malignant masses), its accuracy in terms of size for masses is much better than Mammograms or Ultrasound. I had the wrong type of treatment as a result of not having a pre-op MRI after the Radiologist who did my second look US predicted I had some type of malignant tumor and referred me for a biopsy by US.  The US biopsy noted that my tumor was no more than 13 mm at its widest margin and I was presumed to be Stage I in terms of size and recommended treatment (i.e. IORT).  My tumor turned out to be 2.4 cm and was thus in fact not a candidate for IORT.  Two tumor boards that have since reviewed my case post-op have said that I should have had a pre-op MRI prior to surgery as US is not at all reliable in sizing tumors.  So, there are at least two separate issues here and my position remains that I would rather have an unnecessary biopsy than have a malignant tumor go undetected.  They argue against them on the basis that its not just the issue of having unnecessary biopsies, but unnecessary treatment.  I believe this is because they just don't know how to interpret a lot of pathology that is abnormal, but not clearly malignant, because historically they haven't been able to detect tumors or masses at all until they are a certain size.  As for the pain associated with Breast MRIs, both Breast MRIs I had were more painful than the US and US biopsy I had, although the second Breast MRI I had, which was done on different machine than the first was much more painful, but produced much more detailed findings.  I am unclear if this was due to differences in quality of the machines or thoroughness of reading and interpretation of the radiologist.  Re: the issue of changes from radiation, with WBRT there is a 1% chance of the radiation (15 day - 3 week or 25 day - 5 week course plus the boost) causing a new cancer.  I don't know about risk of new cancers from IORT, in part because I wasn't adequately informed of all of the side effects before hand or after, but also because no cancer specialist wants to criticize another specialist openly (somewhat like the Mafia's Omerta).  It's one reason why they have tumor boards and why so many institutions implement treatment protocols via tumor boards that are not at all individualized to the specific patient - so that no individual specialist nor institution has to take responsibility for treatment decisions that have bad outcomes that may be due to the medical errors or decisions of one or more individual physicians. To WaveWhisperer, all I can say is better certain than sorry.  I would be interested in hearing from you about how the MRI-guided breast biopsy was done, as you have to be on your belly for the Breast MRI.  I also wondered whether it was the surgeon or the radiologist who did it.  I have heard contradictory information about whether it is the surgeon or radiologist who does the MRI -guided core biopsies at the consulting institution I where I am having these issues.   There is Breast MRI technology though that addresses these issues, but it's not currently available and has only been used in clinical trials. It may be available at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Columbia University I'm hoping to find places where it's currently being tested and see whether I can be part of a trial using it for screening. It is reviewed in the following article: Discrimination of Benign and Malignant Breast Lesions by Using Shutter-Speed Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MR Imaging Radiology November 2011 261:2 394-403; Published online August 9, 2011, doi:10.1148/radiol.11102413.  Shutter-speed analysis of breast dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging data was found to produce 98.6% specificity at 100% sensitivity for a cohort of 92 suspicious lesions. Dr. Charles Springer is the PI at Oregon Health and Science University.    Here are two links to articles about the new technology from the OHSU website. http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/news_events/news/2008/breastcancermri110308.cfm?WT_rank=2 http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/news_events/news/2005/02-23-ohsu-scientists-develop.cfm?WT_rank=1 Chelsea",

I have been advised that the denting can be largely corrected with micro fat injections, done over the course of months, but a huge portion of my breast will permanently feel like a crow bar in my breast. My breast is at least 30 % smaller than the good breast, but this and other side effects I have experienced are from the lumpectomy and node dissection. The important thing to know is that IORT is only appropriate for Stage 1 Breast Cancer with negative nodes. I wasn't properly staged preoperatively and shouldn't have had the procedure.  I actually should have had WBRT.  It took me 8 months post-operatively to get a informal, but definitive no regarding further radiation (WBRT) from the people who did the original IORT trials. Luckily, I didn't go along with two tumor boards (one affiliated with my breast surgeon, another with my medical oncologist) that recommended WBRT right after my surgery and my OncotypeDx testing. Also, the problem with IORT is that it is a relatively new procedure and there are no outcomes data on recurrence and survival rates beyond five years and the data which are relevant are only for people who met the criteria for receiving it in the clinical trials.  ",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2012 04:56AM - edited Apr 17, 2012 09:17PM by chelseasanfran Dear Beesie, Thank you for your posting. I am very pleased to know that you have survived 5 years plus out from diagnosis and that you feel your care has been excellent. However, as both a physician and a patient myself, I have to respectfully disagree with many of your general and global comments about doctors (especially surgeons and academic decision leaders in the field). I feel that your response is very defensive given that I have shared only my personal experiences with doctors and care providers in getting help for my breast cancer. I would add that my personal experience is consistent with my professional experience as a holistic physician in both private, clinic and hospital practice over many years. As physicians, our training, the law and the Hippocratic oath obligate us to engage in a meaningful process of informed consent with each and every patient who consents to a specific treatment or intervention that we have discussed or recommended. This involves a comprehensive and meaningful review of the risks and benefits of each treatment in language that the patient can understand.  Sometimes informed consent forms may require that the patient agree to understanding only the most severe and most common complications/risks of a procedure or treatment. Sometimes, the patient merely signs a form saying that the doctor has reviewed all of the risks involved and that the patient acknowledges their understanding in consenting to the procedure. The fact that a patient may be hesitant to have a procedure done due to the knowledge they have a 1% risk of a severe complication weighed against the expected benefits does not justify ignoring the informed consent process. Too many patients sign informed consent forms without reading or understanding what is going to be done to them and what they may likely or less likely expect.  During my medical training, an Arabic speaking Middle Eastern woman whom I was assigned to care for was hospitalized for late stage colon cancer. The doctors thought her life could have been saved, but it would have required removal of much of her colon and a colostomy. Her oldest son, who was head of the household, refused to allow a translator to communicate this information directly to his mother, stating that the shame of a colostomy in their culture would be worse than death and he would not agree to the surgery or a colostomy. As a medical student, I objected to not insisting that the translator be able to communicate to the patient what the doctors were saying. I appealed to my attending that the case be brought before the hospital ethics committee before the patient was discharged, but my concerns were ignored. The family took the woman out of the hospital and brought her home to die, without any treatment. She was not even discharged with a notation in the medical record of \"against medical advice.\" I think that if a patient cannot give informed consent due to cognitive or emotional reasons, then the physician is obligated to provide or recommend to the patient an advocate who can/will assist them in the decision making process.  The patient advocate whom I was assigned at CPMC was severely cognitively impaired and provided me enormous mis-information following my initial diagnosis. And, like most women at time of initial diagnosis, I was ill-prepared to process all of the complex and contradictory information I was provided. This situation only served to increase my stress, impair my functioning and create more barriers to my effective treatment and recovery. The fact is that most of the side effects that I have suffered and was not informed of in advance are common ones. And, while patients should indeed expect (and verify) a surgeon to have extensive expertise in the surgery they are performing, they should also expect their surgeon to have an extensive fund of knowledge about the entire procedure that they are recommending, even if the surgeon is not performing all of the procedure(s) themselves. I think that you are confusing good medical practice, medical competency, and coordinated, individualized care with variations in clinical practice that I consider to be primarily the result of our fragmented health \"system\" and physicians' lack of capacity (in large part due to non-clinical work overload and economic pressures) to provide truly individualized, coordinated and competent care. I do believe that most physicians, given the choice and proper incentives, would work in the best interests of patients.  This, however, is not the current reality, and there is overwhelming evidence, both anecdotal and published, that only those who can afford to pay privately for concierge level care, are likely to get the level and quality of care that we used to take for granted. A good analogy is the public school system, where music programs and physical education are often no longer even part of the basic curriculum. I do not think that good medical care should be evaluated on the basis of style. While I so respect your voice and personal experiences as a survivor, I think it is likewise important not to dismiss the experiences of women like myself, who may suffer or have suffered as a result of poor, improper or unnecessary treatments or care by one or more physicians or care providers. While I am very grateful that national standards and criteria for the diagnosis, staging and treatment of breast cancer, which many providers rely on in lieu of truly individualized care, produce generally good survival outcomes, particularly for those in early stages, had I postponed my annual mammogram another year, as is now being recommended, my cancer would have likely metastasized. Also, despite being at a relatively early stage, I was strongly encouraged to try a relatively new treatment, one which I would not have had, had I been given more information. In addition to the side effects from the surgery and radiation I have suffered (aside from those from chemotherapy), I was subsequently left in limbo regarding how to proceed in terms of further radiation, as there were (also unbeknownst to me at the time) no good data to help guide my future decisions on this treatment and no information from the tumor board on their rationale in recommending whole breast radiation following intraoperative radiation. There are real problems in presuming physician \"excellence\" in the absence of good longitudinal outcomes data and detailed, responsible patient reviews.  Excellence is otherwise typically determined by medical providers and the standing of the physician within their specialty based on academic affiliation, research and publications, economic success, and reputation. And, it is also a problem that each medical specialty tends to over advocate for its own type of treatment/intervention regardless of evidence, whereby different specialists within one institutional \"team\" may advocate/recommend totally different tests or treatments.  I would ask you if among three different specialists, all considered excellent, each gave you a different recommendation and rationale for their decision (based on the same data and studies), how would you decide whom to trust? The last issue, which I have not yet addressed (versus issues with conventional treatments which I have started with), and which is my biggest complaint with the cancer care I have received locally and throughout most of the country is the lack of coordinated integrated care (i.e. conventional and complementary). This is despite the fact that all major cancer centers in the SF Bay area advertise themselves as being truly integrated, when in fact they are not. The complementary care services provided at these local integrative centers (nutrition and supplements, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies and treatments including progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, neurofeedback, etc.) are provided as non-medical programs, with services that are not generally covered by insurance, are for the most part provided as an adjunct to covered services, are not well coordinated with conventional care or providers, and are typically run like high-end spas and concierge practices. Following my surgery, I was looking for a medical oncologist that embraced both conventional and complementary treatments. I first called the Cancer Treatment Centers of America and when I told them I had an HMO that wouldn't cover their services, they told me I could not even get an evaluation there until I put down a $250,000 deposit.  I subsequently called one of the most highly regarded institutionally affiliated integrative centers in the Bay area to ask one of their \"complementary\" medical oncologists for a referral.  The doctor I spoke with said to me, \"why are you calling me, I'm not a referral agency and I don't have any openings for 4 months anyway.\" He said he worked mostly with medical oncologists from the medical facility whose name his center carried and said he helped people only after and separately from the main conventional treatments they received. I said, \"I don't mean to annoy you\" and he replied, \"Well you are.\" I subsequently asked him if there were any truly integrated cancer treatment centers in the US. He said, \"Block in Chicago\" and hung up the phone on me. He was referring to Keith I. Block, M.D. and the Block Center in Skokie, Ill.  I am currently under Dr. Block's care for my diet, nutritional and supplement regimen and other complementary approaches and highly recommend his book, Life Over Cancer - The Block Center Program for Integrative Cancer Treatment.   I will be writing more about my experiences at/with the Block Center in future posts. He and his wife, Penny B. Block, Ph.D. have been major leaders in efforts to promote and provide truly integrative cancer treatment.   ",

My OncotypeDx score was 31 - high intermediate, and an estimated average rate of 20% for distant recurrence at 10 years, which led to the recommendation that I have chemotherapy (I finished four cycles of Cytoxan and Taxotere in early March).  My OncotypeDx score was based on my being node negative. Had I been HER-2/neu positive (I had a FISH test done to confirm that I was HER-2 negative, as the I was informed that the previous tests that were done on my tumor had a high rate (up to 10 %) of false negatives for the HER-2 receptor), they would have recommended that I add Herceptin to my chemo regimen.   ",
