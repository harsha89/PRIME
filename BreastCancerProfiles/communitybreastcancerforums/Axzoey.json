      "Content": "Axzoey wrote: I had s diagnostic mammogram for nipple discharge from one duct(thick sticky). I had large clusters of microcalcifations on that breast so they did ultrasound. They then referred me for a breast mri as my breast tissue was extremely dense. The radiologist called me yesterday and said that breast lit up with a 1.7 cm mass. She said I would need a mri guided biopsy. Questions: 1. Is this considered a large mass? 2. What are the chances this could be cancer? 3. If not cancer, what are some other possibilities that this could be? I have no breast cancer in my family. I have had skin cancer though. Thank y'all! Log in to post a reply",

Also that same breast is very tender and hurts a lot. I'm not sure if that has any value. So if it's not cancer with it being a 1.7cm mass I wonder if they would still recommend removing it?",
