My oncologist/gynecologist took me off it immediately cold turkey. I am Estrogen positive so I start Tamoxifin after radiation. I am worried about mood swings and the terrible hot flashes, not to mention all the other strange side effects I've been seeing. My gyno put my on Paxil for hot flashes, but then yesterday when I talked to oncology, I found out there is a strong interaction between that and the tamoxifin. My oncologist talked to my gyno, so today, they switched me to Effexor. I just started Radiation on Monday so today will be my third time. Did anyone feel tired right off the bat? Yesterday, when I got home at 2:30, I slept until 5pm and then went to bed at my regular time anyways. Could it be the radiation, or is it probably just a coincidence?",

I had my radiation \"education\" appointment last week, and I start radiation on Friday. I guess they don't actually do the radiation until Monday April 10th though because they're doing something else on Friday, such as a dry run or something. Good luck to everyone, and may we all be here to support each other during this difficult, and scary time:-)",

I think it's important to allow yourself to feel what you feel. I don't want to feel embarrassed about being upset about this.

I was on Paxil for hot flashes, but now my doctors figured out the paxil has and interaction with Tamoxifin which I am due to start next month. I took one Effexor pill yesterday morning and felt nauseous all day. Then, it was impossible to sleep. I saw these side effects on the web, but didn't think it would happen to me. Also, I read over and over about how hard it is to get off the Effexor after you're on it for some time. Any thoughts on this? I didn't take it today because I have company coming and I don't want to be sick while they're here.",

It feels like someone peeled off the first few layers of skin and the nerves are exposed. It's waking me up at night when I move my arm. Something that does help is taking a piece of cotton cloth and placing it in my armpit so things don't rub on it. My RO is very helpful and compassionate. I get my RADS in Albany, NY. It's a 50 minute drive one way. My breast really is fine so far! It's just the armpit that's bad.",

The DCIS was in more than one spot, it's high grade, and my margins were barely clear after two lumpectomies. What really stinks is you only get one try with radiation. If this doesn't work, no more radiation in that breast ever. Geez! Not that I want more, but only one shot with this! Randi1035, I think we're all in the same position! The whole experience in surreal and unbelievable isn't it? Many times I can hardly believe this is happening to me and I was diagnosed on February 12! This isn't even gone yet, and I'm already afraid about how I'm going to react when it comes back!",
