I just turned 32 years old and have no family history of breast cancer to my knowledge.  Over the last couple of months, I have progressively developed an indentation/dimpling of my breast directly below my nipple when I raised my arm.  At first I didn't think anything of it, but as it progressed I become a little nervous.  My fiance and I did some research on the internet, and as many of your have stated, all the information that returned was rather alarming.  We both thought we felt something abnormal where the indentation was, so I scheduled an appointment with my ob/gyn.  He was very concerned by the disfiguration of my breast, and definitely felt something.  I was scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound this past Wednesday (6/16).  After the mammogram and 2 ultrasounds, the radiologist informed me that there was definitely an abnormality that was picked up and that she unfortunately could rule out that it was a cyst.  She scheduled me for a biopsy that afternoon where they took several samples of tissue.  I am told I could potentially get my results back tomorrow, worst case scenario on Monday.  I am trying to stay calm but am having a very hard time not thinking the worst at this point.  If they can rule out that it is not a cyst, am I to assume that it is definitely a tumor (either malignant or benign)?  If it does turn out to be benign....would the tumor still need to be removed?  I know the odds are against it actually being cancer, but the fear and anticipation is starting to feel surreal...

Did everyone's hair grow evenly?  My hair is growing much quicker on the sides and back...and pretty slow on top...I'm going to have a mullet if I keep going at this pace!! ",
