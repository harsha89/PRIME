The anxiety and worry are making me miserable, they're making everyone around me miserable, and if I hadn't read that double mastectomies cause infertility, I would already be making appointments with surgeons. I totally understand the thought process and the reasons to look into it. Fibroadenomas, for women who have many of them, are never \"just\" fibroadenomas. Each one you get increases your lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. I'm at 6 now, and that means I have a roughly 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, which is much higher than the national average of only about 12%. I don't want to get even more of them. It feels like I'm setting myself up for the disease.",
