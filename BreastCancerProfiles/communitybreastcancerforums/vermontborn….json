I had a biopsy on Dec 21st and had to wait 10 days before  getting results. The surgeon actually had it in 3 days (I get copies of all test results) but his secretary called on the 24th and said Oh no results yet but he needs to see you and can you come in next Thurs so he can check your incision site and I am sure the results will be in then. Yeah Ok go on with my life and keep positive, and also it was Christmas time so I am sure he wanted to let me enjoy this time but I think I would have rather had the results than thinking of cancer. In my case it was but as everyone kept telling me while waiting 80% of tumors are usually nothing to worry about. So keep the faith I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Good luck and remember no matter what, we woman are strong we can fight this. And believe me venting does help go ahead and yell I get it. And by the way I am WAITING AGAIN oncologist sent tumor for OncotypeDX it takes 10-14 days it has been 9 days and counting!",
