She has just completed a six months course of Chemo. First 3 months of Chemo on one type of Chemo Drug and the last 3 months on another Chemo drug. Last 3 months of Chemo was more painful for her. She is 71 years old. After her last chemo, which was on July 16th, she is feeling very weak and says that she don't feel like eating any more and is hardly eating. As of now she is only drinking water and lemonade mostly. After every chemo session she also get 5 injections in the stomach for increasing White Blood Cell count. She feels extreme pain after those injections, which last for a week. So the good news is that her Chemo is complete. But the bad news is that she is extremely weak and don't feel like eating. She is worried about the surgery and think that it will be lot of pain. Anyone can you please share your experience: 1. What is the best food one would like after the chemo, when you simply don't feel like eating for days? 2. Is the surgery after Chemo a painful process or you simply don't feel anything during the surgery. Sid Log in to post a reply",
