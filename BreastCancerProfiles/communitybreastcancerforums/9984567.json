First, the \"regular\" scanner WILL show your prosthetics clearly and you will be stopped and pulled aside. (Happened to me several times until I strategized a different way.) Some solutions: You can ask for help going through TSA from a disability specialist. Call them in advance. They advised me DO NOT put prosthetics in carry on luggage as some screeners will pull them out for all to see and as noted above, you can't converse with the screeners as they do their job. Another solution is to get TSA precheck. A third solution is to ask for the patdown. However, some of us find this painful in the surgical area. They will remove your cane if you use one and I have been knocked about. There is also some information about that indicates a traveler cannot ask for a patdown any longer (via Chris Elliot's column), that it is up to the TSA personnel to decide this. Sorry for this unpleasant post, but I feel it is better to be aware. My first time through the screener, when the hospital prosthetic department told me there would be no problem, was so humiliating.",
