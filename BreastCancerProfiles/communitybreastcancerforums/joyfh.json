    "Content": "joyfh wrote: i had modified radical mastectomy on april 20 this year with excision of 21 lymph nodes which were all negative for cancer cells. My worry is this swelling which has not subsided after more than 2 months post op. Fine needle biopsy showed negative also for cancer cells. My surgeon was vague about what to do about it since wound healing takes 1-2 years he said. I would like to know if this is normal or need surgery to correct. It is not painful but feels uncomfortable & impedes a bit with range of motion of left arm. Anyone with experience like this post op? Thank you. I had my surgery in cebu philippines & there's not much discussion from my surgeon about what to expect post op. Thankfully i dont have pain before or after surgery. Log in to post a reply",
