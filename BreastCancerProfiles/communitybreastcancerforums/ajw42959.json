I was diagnosed with Stage 2A last month, no cancer at all in family, non-smoker, etc. Just knew the Dr had to be crazy! Anyway, I'm having port put in Friday. The thought makes my skin crawl, but I've always been a really hard stick even in good health...sometimes taking blood out of my hands, blowing the veins, etc. First chemo is next Wednesday. Nice to hear mostly positive about ports.",
