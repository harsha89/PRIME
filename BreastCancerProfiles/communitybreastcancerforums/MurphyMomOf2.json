Hubby kept telling me to make an apt, but anything I read said that BC has no pain, so I thought I was fine. That was until I read some real life discussions of people who have the exact same pain as me with BC. I am so freaked out and scared. The pain is on the bottom right if my right breast. It comes and goes and sometimes is worse than others. As of recently, it is so tender that I can't lay on my stomach. I tried giving myself an breast exam but got impatient due to the fact that my breasts are naturally lumpy. I did find a swollen lymph node in between my breastbone and collar bone as well as a darkness black mole underneath my breast. I had my hubby check them out and he said it just feels swollen. I guess I'm here wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms and what was your diagnosos it any! Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",
