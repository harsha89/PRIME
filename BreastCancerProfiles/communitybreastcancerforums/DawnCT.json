I just had a lumpectomy and while the core biopsy was not painful during the procedure, I was sore for a month afterward.  The lumpectomy was easier in my opinion. As far as sonograms, in my state(Connecticut), radiologists(after your mamogram) are required to notify you in writing as to whether you have dense breasts.   If you do, an ultrasound is required by law.  So,  I have lots of friends who go from the mammogram room to the sonogram room.   So, YES!, insist on the sono for the other breast.  Do an internet search on state laws and sonograms and you will find good info.

It would most likely be covered by insurance.   I had a Breast reduction after my 2nd lumpectomy to get clear margins because the plastic surgeon told me I would have a smaller and different Breast after a 2nd surgery and rads.   Just know that this is an option if you cannot live with the difference in the breasts.    All of this is hard and I'm sorry. ",

I almost got weepy but pulled myself together. I met with the nurse afterward and she said to use Calendula ointment every night along with regular cornstarch put in my bra everyday to absorb moisture. She said if I start to get red I can use the Calendula twice a day but to wipe it off before my rad session. I was told to use only natural deodorant like Toms of Maine or Crystal. I am having prone rads (face down) since I am larger breasted so I do not have a mold. The radiation machine had arms like others mentioned that moved around me. Rosecal - I hope you're doing OK. I get really stressed out at times too. It's is just hard, period. Even if you have a good prognosis. I have good moments and not so good ones with all of this. It is very disruptive to our lives and long term side effects of treatment are concerning! I don't know about you all, but as much as my husband, family and friends try to be there for me, they do not understand. I am grateful that I have not had to go through grueling chemo or a mastectomy but this is still hard! Teamkim - Your last Chemo is coming up! How are you?",

He didn't pull a gown up over me as I got up and then I was had to sit bare - chested on the table while they removed some tape and then didn't even leave the room while I got dressed.  I was really upset and humiliated and wondered if my treatments would all be like that. I told my husband that when you go to any other doctor (a gynecologist for example) they keep you covered as much as possible and will open one side of the gown to examine one breast, cover it, and then examine the other breast.  We are just not used to being treated so impersonally!  These radiation people need to realize that we are people, not body parts to be radiated.  It must be how they are schooled.  I have found my actual radiation sessions to be much better. I have two very nice girls who I am comfortable with.   Teamkim - I wanted to tell you that my MO told me that often side effects of Tamoxifen often resolve in 2 -3 months.  I will be starting it too -  I finish rads on Tues and have been procrastinating on making my next appt with MO to get the prescription. :) I met with him before rads.   I had #22/25 today.  I am feeling the fatigue this week.  I just feel drained and heavy.  It's an odd feeling.  I have a rash on my chest which is itchy but not awful. I am a pink/red but it is not too uncomfortable.  I turned pink during the first few treatments so I was worried but it has only gotten moderately worse so for those of you who are getting pink early , it doesn't mean you are going to get fried!  I have one more regular treatment and two boosts next week and then I'm done.  I will be glad to move past this step and on to the next one.   Still using 100% Aloe and Calendula 2 times a day.  My center told me to mix them together in my hand and apply.   For those of you just starting, the time passes quickly,  Hang in there!   Dawn",

I do think the creams/aloe can be soothing if you do get irritated. Also, applying my calendula ointment and aloe mentally made me feel like I was doing something to help my skin, even if it wasn't really helping  I don't think you should worry that you are not getting good medical care because of this. They will take good care of you.  Try not to worry!    If you look further back into this winter rads thread someone posted a link to an article about this very subject - it may make you feel better.

Rosecal - I can completely relate to everything you have said. Out timing is similar so let's keep in touch! I am starting Rads on Monday (Dec16th) and am scheduled for 25 zaps. I had my simulation and tattoos already. It was all easy and getting the tattoos was nothing They are so tiny - I only have two and one I cannot even see. I am most nervous about this idea of receiving radiation. I know it won't hurt other than dry skin but it's a scary concept. I also worry about breast shrinkage. I had a breast reduction along with my second lumpectomy( due to unclear margins) because the surgeon said it would be disfiguring especially after radiation. I opted to get the breast reduced and have the other breast matched for symmetry. I am happy with the results and don't want it messed up by radiation! My hospital is just 5 minutes away and like everyone, it will only take a few minutes so that part won't be bad. I do not know what lotions/creams are recommended yet as I will meet with the nurse on Monday. My plastic surgeon did say to make sure that I moisturize during the process. I think I am going to be participating in a clinical trial where Herceptin is given before the 1st dose of radiation. My tissue was sent out to see if it was Her2+. If it is then I will be doing the trial. I hope I can be of help to everyone as I will be heading into radiation before some of you.",

You and I had our first surgeries on the same day and now we will have our re-excisions on the same day-October 29th. I am adding a breast reduction to my re-excision. So, it will involve a lot more recovery. I decided to do this for a couple of reasons. 1- I consulted a plastic surgeon who told me that after the re-excision and radiation that my breast would be more damaged than I would like. The oncoplasty and reduction will help with that. 2. I have large breasts and have wanted a reduction for a long time and knew that I would not ever be able to have it following radiation. I am really nervous but feel comfortable that it is the right decision. My BS and PS will be in the operating room together. Please keep us posted on your re-excision and recovery! I am still amazed at what a long process this is. I will look forward to getting my mind onto other things in a few months. Dawn",

I actually wish my surgeon had offered me this option from the very beginning(before first lumpectomy) but it was me who started asking questions about it.  I started considering it because I know that after radiation , I would never be able to have it done.  I have thought of having a reduction/lift for many years.  I am just so nervous about getting good results.  I have looked at a lot of before and after photos online and some results were not so great!

I have seen the results of my surgery and am having to mentally adjust as my breasts are definitely smaller than I wanted. I saw the pathology report today and the breast surgeon was aggressive in what she took out so the plastic surgeon had to work with that. I actually had no DCIS found at all so the margins were clear at the first surgery! Oh well. Now my other concern is that the tissue they removed was described as \"fatty\" breast tissue. I am worried radiation is going to shrink my bad girl as apparently fatty breasts tend to do that more during radiation. I feel guilty even complaining as I know others have been through so much more. Thanks for listening Dawn",

This is quite the process! My PS said the same thing - we won't really know the results until the 6 month point. I asked my PS what we would do if the bad girl shrinks and he said we would do lipo on the good girl. I am so hoping that I will not need that as I do not want to be smaller! What will be will be I guess. I am wishing for great final results for both of us! How are you doing with your Chemo? I hope it is not too bad and you will be done soon? Fephna - Thank you for responding and for sharing your feelings abut your reduction. It helps! I am getting used to them and feeling better. It will be nice to get back into a regular bra. I think you are right about dealing with the change is harder because if was not really our choice. I keep thinking of how much worse it could be and try to be grateful. I am into week three now an am more sore than week two. My skin on the bad girl feels sunburned. I have been taking Advil which helps but am trying not to be on it constantly. I don't want to take the pain meds as they make me groggy and of course I can't drive. I had this burning after the first lumectomy too so I guess this is just how I heal. I know it will be better in a couple of weeks. All in all, this surgery has not been too bad. I have an appt with my Oncologist next week to discuss radiation I do know that I do not have to have the boosts so that should help with the cosmetic outcome. I am posting this link to an article about breast reduction and radiation that made me feel better about having this procedure. Maybe it will help someone else. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884710/ Dawn",

I have been told I will not be able to drive or reach for anything for 10 days. Do you think I will feel like doiing some things around the house after the first week? Things like paperwork? I bought my Christmas cards today in hopes that I will feel like doing those while I am laid up, I have a dentist appt on day 8. Will I be able to manage that? I am not having any nodes removed. Also, the nurse said they may put a urinary catheter in during surgery and I am prone to UTIs so that worries me a bit. My GP gave me a valium to take that morning so I know that will take the edge off! Thanks for your help!",

You gave me some great tips especially about keeping the incisions dry. I definitely want as few complications as possible. My surgeon had me buy surgical bras ahead of time to bring to his office. I got the Marena as suggested on BC.org by so many people and find it to be very comfortable. I am still stuffed with gauze and padding at least until I get the stitches removed on weds. It will be nice to get rid of all that and wear regular clothes again. I am already going stir crazy being in the house. I did get to see my results and think they look great. They are boxy but I know that will resolve in time. One question : - should I take pain meds to get the stitches removed? I thought the drain removal was a little painful but quick.  Dawn ",

What he told me is that I will be better off getting the breast reduction vs just the re-excision.  I already have an indention from the first lumpectomy and now would have to remove more tissue when dong a re-excision so it would be more pronounced.  He also said that radaition will make that area contract and the nipple will likely start to pull to the left.   I am not going to be reduced by much.  I am a DD but I am a larger boned person and 5'9\" so I do not feel disproportionate so I do not want to be a lot smaller.   We discussed doing one breast now and one a year from now but he said he almost never can talk anyone into doing that!  He showed me pictures of breasts after radiation and really, it was not a huge change.   So, I am setting surgery up for after October 20.  I'm sure I will be really nervous but I do think I am doing the right thing.   I appreciate your help!

I do have to have rads but no chemo.  This is a looong process!   There is one thing I forgot to mention is that the surgeon said that if the lumpectomy area is too much in the median area of the breast then he will have to remove and reattach the nipple.  Something about blood supply going through that area to the nipple.  That would stink but I still think it would be worth it.  He said he will not know that until he opens the breast up.   And, he said it is an outpatient surgery - I won't be in hospital overnight unless there is a problem or I'm really nauseous.   I appreciate your encouragement and that you are happier with your new breasts!

The last pain pill I took was yesterday morning and have been doing Ok on extra strength Tylenol. I realize I may get days where I still need the prescription meds. I saw my surgeon on wed when he removed my drains and he said the nipples have good blood supply. Yay! He did not have to do the nipple graft and I'm so glad. He did say the BS removed an area right up to behind the nipple. I have to find out more about that. I expect to get the biopsy results back tomorrow. It would really be awful if I didn't get clear margins this time! The worst part of this was an awful headache that started on Weds that I just could not shake. I finally called the doc on Thurs who told me to drink a cup of coffee as it might be caffeine withdrawal and voila, the headache was gone! I was so surprised abut this as I usually just have 2 cups of coffee a day. I mad sure I had a cup for breakfast this morning. The nurses and doctors at the hospital were great and the the scolpamine patch really helped with the nausea. I think it should be standard procedure in all hospitals. I am so far happy with the results as well and feel so much lighter. I just will be glad to get back to life again I guess radiation will start in a month or so. I am glad to be on the other side of the surgery and am grateful to this board for helping me to prepare.. All the tips about home preparation, what supplies to buy and what bra was the best has helped so much! Fephna - I am so happy for you that your rads are over!! How did your girl hold up? Rest up! I am glad you are on your way. Thanks again! Dawn",

I had the reduction surgery on 10/29/13.  If I had known what the surgery was like, I would have done it years ago.  I did not find it to be too bad at all.  The worst part was not being able to fully shower or wash my own hair for 10 days.  It was not very painful but the first couple of days were kind of yucky( just blah)from pain meds and effects of anesthesia.   I completed my radiation on January 21st.  So far, if there is any breast shrinkage, it is not obvious.  My PS said that it is possible to see changes for up to a year.  This is something I worry about too but am pleased that I have not shrunk at this point.    It is good that you liked your surgeon. The things I think are important: Did he show you photos of  his previous work?   It is important that you know what results you might expect.  How much smaller will you be after the surgery?  Will you have to have nipple grafting? I did not have to have nipple grafting but did lose sensation in the lumpectomy breast as the BS removed area right up behind the nipple. That is the one thing I wish had a different outcome for me.   Please feel free to PM me if you need to.  I will be so happy to answer any questions! Dawn     ",
