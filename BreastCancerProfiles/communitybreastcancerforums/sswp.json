I do regret telling a newly hired assistant that I was going for surgery (didn't disclose what kind of surgery) and that I didn't know when I'd be back at work. The assistant blabbed that I was gone for surgery to other employees, suppliers and clients. It turned out I came back in under a week and worked remotely during my absence even on the day of the surgery. So I do regret telling the assistant because I wasn't gone for long and he lacked discretion. I have a new assistant and I've decided not to tell him anything. This may change depending on how much time I'll be away from the office during chemo. I figure I might not be taking much time off in which case why bother saying anything. ",

When I was at emerg the other day (day 11) I asked for a mask at the triage desk and wore it for close to 4 hours. I also asked to wait in a separate room which they granted but they put another patient with me that was also immuno compromised from undergoing chemo treatment. The other patient was coughing the whole time I'm not sure what she was there for. The next day I was at the cancer center (day 12) and didn't take any precautions. I've also eaten at restaurants, shopped and worked at my office in the last week with no precautions. I don't know if I'm being cautious enough but I can't stay home and not go anywhere when I'm feeling up to it. It's bad enough I didn't feel up to going anywhere the first 5 days of chemo.",

I guess that's why I have been trying to control my physical appearance and my work situation. I've also received similar comments from others that they think I'm amazing considering everything I'm going through. I honestly don't know how I'm able to function at all, I don't consider myself a strong person. My husband and I have been together for over 32 years and he's the only one that comes close to understanding and how to help me. Even though I've had my last chemo infusion there is still radiation, hormonal therapy, surveillance. That's why I'm trying to live my life as much as I can even during treatment because the entire process is a long road. ",

I put a little more effort in my makeup and clothes to make it look like I was trying to look nice and the hair was just part of the effort. I even had responses ready in my head like if someone asked me about my hair, I would say something like, \"I guess this is what $300 hair looks like haha\". The only comments I got were variations of \"you got your hair cut, looks good\". It helped that I had worn my wig in public beforehand and received honest feedback from family members.",

Hard to know what's around the corner with the SE's from day to day. especially with a new drug. There's been lots of warnings from the doc and nurses at the cancer center that taxotere has worse SE's than FEC so I'm feeling a little apprehensive. As for the wigs, I don't know how I could've functioned without them during these last couple of months. I always wear one when I'm out except to the cancer center (where I often wear a beanie) if I don't plan on going anywhere else. After chemo 1, dh had buzzed my hair short. I still have sparse hairs that haven't fallen out that have been growing a little and I haven't bothered buzzing them.",

      "Content": "Apr 21, 2018 01:46AM - edited Apr 21, 2018 01:49AM by sswp Had my last chemo infusion yesterday. Radiation will start in about three weeks, hormonal therapy will also start during this time. I've gained quite a bit of weight during the taxotere portion. Also lost all my lashes and almost all my eyebrows. I find it hard to look human. I've been using more makeup in an attempt to hide the side effects. I bought some fake eyelashes but haven't bothered trying them yet, I have been just using heavier eyeliner. I've been drawing on fake eyebrows over the few stubborn hairs that have been hanging on and find this challenging since I don't normally use eyebrow makeup. I keep asking my husband if he thinks generally people can tell by looking at me I'm going through treatment and he says no. It's not because I'm vain, I haven't disclosed to most of my work world and I'm wondering if I'm fooling anyone. I know from comments they've noticed I look different but I don't know if they think it's because I'm a cancer patient. I had a meltdown last week at work. The business has been doing an unusually high volume of work for the last two months and new and some old employees have been stressing me out. The stress came to a head and I started crying at work and couldn't stop. After a few hours I just took off for the day without explanation and went home still sobbing for the whole day. I guess the stress that I've been feeling at work and having to do it all while going through treatment had reached a dangerous level. Most of the employees work outside of the office so they didn't witness my breakdown. All but one of the employees that did witness it know I'm going through treatment so they seemed to understand. It's a very complicated situation. It's a family business that I've been working at for 25 years come next month. When I started working here I was going through cancer treatment for thyroid cancer. Five years ago I went through more treatment for thyroid cancer. Over the years, I have felt torn between my own situation and my upbringing as a dutiful Asian daughter as far as serving the family business. I guess the stress of it just got too much. It's a struggle to even walk up the stairs or walk from the parking lot to the cancer center. My legs feel they have no strength and it's been cumulative. Judging from the last two infusions of taxotere, I'll have bone and muscle pain in the next couple of weeks. Last round was not as bad since I finally listened to my doctor and took codeine for about 4-5 days and then switched to extra strength tylenol. The fatigue is overwhelming most days. Most food doesn't taste like it should. Strength to all of us who are going through to this. ",

The day I received the results of my biopsy, my friend came over to my house and witnessed myself and my husband cry and talk about how we were feeling. She is a family counselor by trade and I was grateful that she was there. A couple days later she sent me a text starting with \"how are you feeling\" and then a long rant about her ex-husband's crazy girlfriend and expecting a response from me. It made me realize that our relationship had always been very one-sided, that it was often all about her. I don't have the energy at the moment to deal with her so I've just distanced myself. It's not a break up, it's more of a time out that may be temporary or permanent. My SIL who lives across the country acts like she's an expert on bc. Apparently her credentials are that she has one friend who just went through treatment and a co-worker with another type of cancer. I don't have a close relationship with her and up until the point of my diagnosis I hadn't spoken or text her in years, the only communication was between her and my husband. Since my diagnosis she's been texting and snapchatting me regularly. She is starting to wear on me. After my surgery, my husband told her what my pathology was. She took it upon herself to bounce if off her friend that has bc and came back with a point by point analysis of what her friend thought of each aspect of my pathology. I felt violated. I didn't ask for her to do this, her friend's brother is someone I went to school and university with. I have doctors, this board, and the world wide web at my disposal if I need information. I get that maybe she was concerned and wanted her friend's opinion. But hearing her friend's opinion stressed me out. The other day, she asked me how I was doing, I said I felt fine. She responded with \"I hear the fourth treatment gets harder\". I assume she heard this from her friend. Like I need to hear this, like I haven't been obsessing and researching day and night about how I'm going to get through the next five months of chemo and then radiation. All I want her to say is I'm glad you're feeling ok. It's almost like she thinks I'm being too positive, posting photos of myself looking ok on social media instead of documenting step by step the hardships I'm going through. Unlike her friend, I have not shared on social media what I'm going through. Some people get support that way and that's great, but I'm a private person and have chosen not to do this. I've only shared my situation in person with some family members, the friend I talked about, and three employees. My new hashtag is #noapologies. I make no apologies for keeping myself sane by sharing only what I want to share and distancing myself from people that take away my energy, since I have so little of it lately. I make no apologies for putting my health first, both physical and mental. It is my choice what I choose to share with my SIL, and if she wants to help she should just be supportive, instead of assuming I'm in denial and that it's her job to bitch slap me into reality. Sorry for the long post, I guess I've been bottling this up for awhile. Oh wait, #noapologies lol.",
