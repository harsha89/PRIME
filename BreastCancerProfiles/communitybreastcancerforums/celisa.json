      "Content": "celisa wrote: Hello everyone! I am a doctoral student who is about to begin a project entitled:\"A Feminist Cultural Study of Identity, Hair and Hair Loss Due to Chemotherapy.\" I examine the many symbolic meanings of hair portrayed in the media, and the psychological impact hair loss engenders on women fighting cancer. My project will include interviews with female cancer survivors, as I strongly believe that narratives enlighten our understanding of what it means for women to live with cancer and hair loss. I decided to concentrate my research on Chemotherapy Induced Alopecia and its impact on women following my cancer diagnosis in 2005. As the majority of patients undergoing chemotherapy, I experienced hair loss and it had a disastrous impact on my day to day life. If you are interested in my research, please contact me via email (CGuiller@fau.edu). I will be delighted to give you more information about myself and my research, and I will send you a questionnaire to fill in. All questionnaires will be kept anonymous. Thank you for your help!
