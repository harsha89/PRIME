Hair coming in at the temples so that at least it is noticeable, and on top and in back very thin. Most came in white/clear fuzz, i've colored it so that I could actually see it and not feel like it wasn't growing at ll. So many of your posts give me hope that sometime this summer my male pattern baldness with fade to real hair.. any suggestions",

It does seem that the more I try to control something the less I can.... I don't know if I will ever be my old self, only hoping i can be happy with the new self",

I was on A/C for four sessions, and then on Taxotere for four sessions, last one was on February 24... maybe it seems so long ago because it was literally freezing out then, and it was 90 here today.",

I am trying to be patient, i laugh at myself on occasion, it took 10 days from when i got my first AC for the hair to fall out completely, i want it to grow back that fast. Today I did the Race for the Cure in Pittsburgh and was able to talk to a few women about our experiences, and do feel a little better about my hair. I know its minor, but it seems to be a focus point for me. Like if my hair is growing back, I really am better..",
