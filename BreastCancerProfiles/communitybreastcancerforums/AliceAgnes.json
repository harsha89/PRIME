I am so excited to be feeling this good again! MommyErin, that's great news about those nodes testing negative for cancer. Your story gives me hope because I was on the same chemo regimen you were on. Of course I know everyone's story is different so I will maintain an attitude of cautious optimism.

Does anyone else have that sensation post-surgery?

Carol246 -- When I read the article on drains that I posted, I realized that I have dealt with a Jackson-Pratt drain once before. In 2007 a motor scooter accident left me with a huge seroma on my lower left leg. Ultimately my doctor had to place the same type of drain on my leg. I had to stay off my feet for several days, keep my leg elevated, and continually empty the drain and measure and record the ounces that I had emptied into a small medicine cup. I no longer recall how or where I slept at night with the drain on my leg. so sleeping must not have been too difficult for me. Now I expect that drains located in the underarm and breast areas will be more uncomfortable, but I hope the process of emptying the drains a few times a day will remain relatively simple. If not, I'll just have to ask for help as MarilynIllinois did. MarilynIllinois -- How wonderful that you got through surgery relatively unscathed! Thanks for sharing your experience with us.

I, too, am doing as little as possible to reduce the flow more quickly. In a way, it's a moot point for me, though, because my surgeon won't see me again until September 12, and that's when she plans to take out the drains. However, she did say call her anytime if I have a need, so I might just give her a call if the output slows down significantly before the 12th. Just got my post-op call from her this morning. She said the chemo shrunk the main tumor down to 3/4\" (about half its original size) and two of 20 nodes that were removed still showed small signs of cancer. These remaining growths can be handled with a new course of treatment I was expecting to have, anyway--radiation, hormone therapy taken orally, and continuing Herceptin infusions through March 2018. I have an appointment with my oncologist on Sept. 11 to discuss next steps. Overall I am really happy with my progress so far, and I feel ready to move forward with the rest of the treatment.

I had my surgery on Monday at noon and was released from the hospital by noon the following day. My lucky three-in-one package was a sentinel node biopsy, unilateral mastectomy, and axillary node dissection. The surgeon told me she could not find the cancerous node that was clipped back in March. Lots of things can happen with clips between March and August. I have had her for surgery twice before--for my thyroid and my gall bladder--and got good results so my trust in her now remains unshaken. I have slept well both nights since surgery and have had no trouble doing the follow-up exercises the doctor recommended. I have also managed to avoid painkillers since coming home. I had my last one the one night I stayed in the hospital after surgery. I hate the side effects of hydrocodone! They're like being on chemo again, UGH. One thing I kept forgetting to ask about was sleep positioning after going home. In the hospital my bed was in a slightly upright position. I googled my options and learned that sleeping on a recliner might be good or else sleeping in bed as usual, but on the side that was not affected by surgery. So I started the night in a recliner and got a couple of hours of good sleep, woke up and went to the bathroom, then decided, what the heck, I'm returning to my bed. I am habitually a side sleeper. Then I slept soundly until 9:30 this morning. I think I'll just use my bed tonight. Everyone who said surgery was easier than chemo was right! At least that has been true for me so far. And, oh, by the way! I had time this morning to re-read the radiology report on a suspicious area in my right breast, the one I still have. The diagnosis back in March was CCC (Columnar Cell Change), a benign cell condition. I know I have to keep getting an annual mammogram, but according to one source I read online, full-blown cancer is unlikely to result from this condition. This is the web page where I got this info: http://breast-cancer.ca/clmncellesions/",

Chemo reduced the size of my tumor, but during surgery more cancer was found in my lymph nodes, too. Twenty nodes were removed after I had been told possibly there would be a need to remove only the one with the known cancer. There are some things doctors just can't know before surgically removing tissue and turning it over to a radiologist. You can do this. The port does make chemo a lot easier, and there are ways of reducing chemo's side effects. Just keep reporting symptoms to your doctors, and ask lots of questions. With the information you provide them, they'll find ways to make things better for you during treatment.",

I was first diagnosed in March, when I was promptly put on chemo. I had my 6th and final round of TCHP three weeks ago, but was left pretty depleted--with anemia and such. In the meantime, eating right has been a problem because everything tastes bitter and anything with much fiber in it goes straight through me. Chronic fatigue and shortness of breath have also been problems.Docs say the shortness of breath is from low hemoglobin levels in my blood. Bottom line: my onc wants me to have time to regain my strength and rebuild my blood before even thinking about surgery. I won't see a surgeon to discuss possible surgery dates until August 22. When I first spoke with her in March, she recommended a unilateral mastectomy because my cancer is multicentric. During surgery she will also remove one cancerous axillary node, but is hopeful that no other nodes will need to be removed. However, one thing I've learned from visiting these message boards is that surgery sometimes reveals \"surprises,\" so I am mentally preparing myself for the possibility of new information resulting from the surgery. One peculiarity that the docs noticed early on was that ONLY mammograms and biopsies showed I had any cancer at all--palpitation revealed nothing. Best wishes to all those with surgery dates coming up soon! I will be thinking of you as the first week of August unfolds. Please share your experiences and advice with the rest of us who have longer to wait, and thanks in advance for doing so.",

MrsWinnie, LisaBS, and rljessu, I wish you all a splendid recovery. My surgery date has finally been set for Monday, the 28th. My unilateral mastectomy is set for 11:45 a.m. I will also have a sentinel node biopsy at that time. An axillary node dissection is a possibility, but the doctor and I are hoping that can be avoided. Your good thoughts and/or prayers will be much appreciated. Also, thanks to all who have written about your experiences here. I like going into this with as much info as possible, and you have been most generous with your sharing.",

It will lessen the number of days you will have to spend on the drains. Another sojourner down this path said the first time she had breast surgery, she tried to do way too much afterwards. Even little things like taking a walk around the block because she had the energy to do so--she said she should not have done. The second time she had a surgery requiring drains, she did as little as possible and got much better results. Spent only days on the drains instead of weeks. Just passing that along--. ",

LisaBS, looks like you're using a full arsenal against your cancer as I am for mine. My doctors wanted me to have chemo first, so I got six infusions every three weeks between late March and early July. in March I also began a course of Herceptin infusions that will take a full year to complete.Then came a unilateral mastectomy on August 28. At that time the surgeon also saw I needed two layers of lymph nodes removed; two of the 20 that were removed proved to be positive for cancer. These had not been detected in prior imaging. Sometime in October I will start radiation of the chest wall and axillary lymph node area. The simplest part of my treatment will come last-- taking an AI orally for the rest of my life. Life can be \"fun\" for a triple-positive girl! I agree with all the others who say chemo is doable no matter what complications may arise for you along the way. My doctors were very good at addressing my side effects whenever I reported them. The key thing is to report them, even when you are tempted to think, oh, this is nothing and I can just power my way through it. Nah, save your energy for more important things. Get the help you need when you need it. I wish you all the best, Lisa, and hope to keep reading here about your progress.",

The Her2+ piece does add a whole new dimension to your treatment program. I started Herceptin in March and it will continue until March of next year. Have been tolerating it well. Chemo also started in March and ended on July 10. Two out of the six treatments were difficult for me, but everyone's story on that is different. Her2+ is an aggressive cancer and must be treated aggressively. Hence, the need for chemo. Eventually I will be put on an inhibitor and that will be for life, I am told. Doctors do try to space things out for you without compromising your overall treatment plan. The important thing is that the cancer is TREATABLE. Just try to take things one step at a time. Going through treatment is better than the alternative!",

I am able to do all the post-surgical exercises I was assigned without any pain. However, my next step will be radiation, and during my mapping session this week I did experience a flair of the arthritis I have in my right shoulder. It was difficult to hold my right arm behind my head while lying flat for an extended period of time. Fortunately the rads themselves will only take 15 minutes or so once I get started on them. Also, I have been told it will be OK to take an oral pain reliever before I leave home. I had chemo before surgery--TCHP. It wasn't easy, but it was doable. For me the worst effects were in my GI tract. My arthritis wasn't affected. Doctors kept working with me to minimize the side effects. Meds did help in most cases. Hang in there!",

There is lots of redness with that but so far no pain. A couple of weeks ago I got fitted for my prosthesis and my experience was similar to yours--kinda fun. I won't be wearing mine, though, until all the redness is gone from radiation. I wear loose cotton tops and don't want to irritate my skin with any extra clothing. At night I even sleep topless because the nurses told me letting air get to the radiated areas hastens healing. :) Thanks for updating us on your progress. I hope your \"board\" diminishes down to nothing soon!",
