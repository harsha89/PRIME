I am sure I don't want reconstruction, I am just fine with this. Just so long as I can get it cleaned up a little. Pretty ugly looking right now. I do have an appointment in June. So I will be trying to get it done very soon after that appointment. I am sorry you had to go through this also. Cancer is such a horrible thing. I have lost many family members and friends to it. Again thank you so much.",
