    "Content": "worriedwoman wrote: I had my second stereotactic biopsy on Monday and got the call from the breast surgeon today....I was sure hoping for benign results.........but they came back with more ADH.....so now there are three areas and I am scheduled for excisional biopsy/lumpectomy of all three areas. I am more scared about the wire placements than anything......I asked the surgeon and she said that is probably the hardest part of the entire day. My surgery is scheduled for January 13 so any ideas on how to prepare for the wire placments would be appreciated. Thanks to all the wonderful and helpful women here on this site - this has indeed been \" an anchor in this storm\" as someone else on the site put it. I feel such gratitude for you all.
