I was in braces as an adult, just got out of them before I was diagnosed with BC. I need to stop here to say I work in a dental office. With all that was going on I stopped wearing my retainer and I noticed some shifting. Then when I started on Xeloda I noticed I was grinding my teeth at night and felt that the teeth were not as solid in the bone from all the grinding. I had my boss make a mouth guard for me that I wear at night, this has helped. I am also on IV Zometa so any extraction is out of the question. I am 58 years old and have all my teeth - wisdom, most of my molars are crowned and 2 root canals. I really think it is the stress factor setting in, so anyone having tooth issues might consider asking your Dentist to make you a mouth guard, you may be grinding at night and not know it. If you have large filling, grinding can break the remaining tooth structure and a crown will be necessary. I work with dental \"insurance\" and it is very hard to get health insurance to pay for things that are dental. I have tried and without much success. The only success I have had,  with what we call \"cross coding\", was in accident cases, like riding your bike and crashing face first into a tree. Ladies, keep up with brushing and flossing, no matter how tired your are. Ask your oncologist when you can get your teeth cleaned and checked. Let your oncologist know you are concerned about your teeth, as I travel through this journey I have realized that most medical doctors are not concerned about teeth, so we must ask them. Actually many medical professionals have the worst teeth and gums in our dental office. I guess they are just to busy to take care of their own mouths.   ",

I have been using Biotene Mouth wash, it's for Dry Mouth but I use it because the SE of Xeloda can be mouth sores, I'm trying to prevent that . Try to stay away from alcohol based Mouthwash, alcohol can cause drying too, just adding to the problem.",

After the 2nd treatment the liver mets was almost undetectable in the scan, had 4 treatments but had to stopped the Abraxane as it made me so tired I could hardly get out of bed in the morning and just sat around all day. That is not like me, Dr. is giving me a break from the Abraxane but continued the Avastin, all was going well but last week I started getting pain in both hips, ibuprofen 600 mg. is helping but will call the Dr. tomorrow. I just read about the Avastin after I started feeling hip pain, not sure if it is bone met flair-up or my bad back acting up. Dr will probably try to bump up my bone scan that is scheduled next month. I had to jump through some hoops to get my insurance to cover the last sets for treatment, never had trouble before. I think it was due to adding the Avastin into the mix. That stuff is so expensive, now I doubt that any insurance will cover it now. My oncologist told me that because it was so new she did not know how long it would be effective and to call her if I felt pain anywhere. Getting tired of the roller coaster ride.",

I have not had a problem with it, I get the infusion once a month before going to work. I am always sipping coffee or water during the day. I also checked with my onc about taking 500 mg of Calcium and 400 IU of Vitamin D she approved it but said no more then 500 of the calcium. (I read about this on another thread). I get a bone scan this week, I'll be looking forward to see what the results will be. Think positive ☺",

So far so good, sometimes a little tingling in hands and around lips and mouth I have been drinking lots of water, eating a rather bland diet lots of rice, cooked vegs. lean meat. Trying to stay away from the diarrhea SE, only have a problem with that when I ate out, and with spicy food. My second order of pills came today with a zippered carrying case with Xeloda information booklets, a sample of Uddertly sMOOth hand cream, (which I already bought and use regularly) and a daily pill carrying case. Xeloda also offers a nurse that is familiar with Xeloda that you can call and she will set up a once a month check up call to you. Just read a little on this. Has anyone used this service?",
