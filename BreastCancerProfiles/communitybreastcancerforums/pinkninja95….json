I figured I had bmx Dec 10 so I should be able to drive a little but it was hard to turn my wheel and also back up because I couldn't really turn around.

The Valium definitely helps with the tightness but it makes me sleepy during the day. My underarms are still hurting me and they are a part of the te I'm guessing that really hurts.

The ps gave it to me along with valium and I told him I was little nervous about taking a new drug so he also gave me dilaudid to use if I needed it. I don't think the new rx works at all so I have been taking the delaudid instead. I was just interested if anyone else took it. I asked all my nurses at the hospital and no one heard of it.

It seems like most of us are over the hardest part. I'm on day 12 after my bmx with te's. My te's couldn't be filled at all when they were put in because my chest muscles were so tight. I have my second follow up appt with the ps tomorrow and I'm praying the drains come out. Those te's are a pain in the butt! I'm putting out about 22-30 ml's and he said if I was under 30 each day, they could come out. I'm still having a lot of discomfort and pain around the te's. It's like they are too big for my body and really bother me under my arms and at the sides. I feel like I'm wearing a tight corset and its squishing everything. Several days ago, I noticed my right foot was swollen (it's the same side the lymph nodes were removed on). I'm gonna show the ps tomorrow but will probably have to go to my primary dr because if that isn't enough, I'm pretty sure I have thrush in my mouth. My tongue looks digesting and it's really sore. Ive been rinsing several times a day with salt water. I'm still on the pain meds and Valium and will ask him when I should start weaning off them. I'm kinda scared though because I hate pain!! I can't wait to get the bandages off and see my flat boobs. I did skin and nipple sparing but kind of wished they took the nipples cause I'm having a lot of pain in them.

I keep waking up though at 2 am and I feel like my right boob (oops forgot, no more boob there) the te's or something is so painful. I'm fine most days and can keep the pain under control with either dilaudid or Vicodin and the Valium so I'm not sure why it's waking me up. Im gonna try to adjust the meds time so I'm taking the Valium and pain med right before I go to bed, that may help. Scottie, I have been dying to take a nice long soak in the tub so maybe I'll do what you did, take a mini soak. I'm just worried about my skin getting even more dried out than it is. I am so itchy and I use baby oil after shower and Aveeno lotion on my body once the baby oil dries.
