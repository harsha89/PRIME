I had left breast mastectomy (stage 3B) and lymphectomy in April 2007, with a saline expander inserted concurrently at the same surgery.  It was very uncomfortable.  I am a thin, small breasted woman and the procedure left me very tight.  The expander was way too high up on my chest wall.  I began PT and never regained range of motion in this arm.  I can lift the arm forward almost straight up (around 150 degrees), but abduction motion to the side is only 90 degrees, with alot of pain.  Had 8 sessions of chemo, and then 5100 rads, full chest, axillary, collarbone, scapula.  Last radiation treatment was December 2007.  The PS, who I had been seeing all this time, said we needed to wait for the skin to heal.  So last June 2008, 6 months later, I had the expander removed and a gel silicone implant inserted.  I have had no further improvement in range of motion.  Even had an MRI done to see if I had other shoulder complications.  I am an active person, very outdoors, own a farm, started doing yoga and pilates in addition to the PT to try to get more motion back.  The implant sits as high as the expander did (it feels like it's right under the collarbone).  There wasn't enough \"stretch\" accomplished, I think because of the lack of any extra tissue after the mastectomy.  The pectorals are stretched violin wire tight.  I think the PS should have told me I was not a good candidate for reconstruction.  I would never have had reconstruction if I had been given this information about the possible side effects of radiation and reconstruction, in addition to the overall tightness after the initial mastectomy. Now that the implant is in place, 8 months later, I'm still doing PT, yoga, etc.  I just saw the PS last week, and he says it is a consequence of radiation, that the muscle tissue has changed and become fibrous.  Don't know why he never mentioned this before.  I'm disappointed to say the least.  I believe he should have told me I wasn't a good candidate especially after seeing the poor results achieved with the expander.  Right now, I'm tired of seeing any more doctors, want to get on with living, so have no desire to remove the implant (which BTW, the PS says won't give me much relief).  I hope this helps in your decision.  I think alot depends on how much fat tissue you have remaining.  Bonnie's comment, posted above mine, sounds pretty similar to my situation.  Whatever your decision, all my healing thoughts are with you.",
