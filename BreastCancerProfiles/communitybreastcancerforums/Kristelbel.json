    "Content": "Kristelbel wrote: I saw my gyn today for my annual exam, and I mentioned I've been having on & off pain/tenderness in my left breast right near my arm pit. This happened about a year ago as well and I had a mammogram & ultrasound done which were both normal. The pain comes & goes and seems to be worse about 2 weeks before my period and lasts about a week. There are times when I have no pain. But now there is a lump. I have to wait a week for my mammogram. Ironically I am an oncology nurse so I'm paranoid About cancer as it is. How worried should I be? I'm only 31 yrs old and have 2 small daughters. I can't bear to think of what will happen if this is cancer.Â  Log in to post a reply",
