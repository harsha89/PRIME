However, I'm not sure it made any difference ;-). I say this because for the first 3 and a half weeks, I was using the lotions, but didn't realize how large the field was that was getting radiated, so I only put it on about 2/3 of the area. Finally, when it started turning pink, I realized I was missing a big area. The skin in both areas are equally great. Of course, from then on I started applying the lotion all over. I'm not suggesting anyone skip the lotions, but I can't say I'm convinced it mattered nearly as much as everyone seems to think. I used the Aquaphor every night. I didn't enjoy how thick it was, so I didn't use that during the day. For daytime, my favorite was the Miaderm (least smell, not too sticky, etc). But if you miss an application, I wouldn't panic! EtnasGirl, glad you are doing well! Kimmer, I'm pretty convinced that any lotion you use would be just fine. I ordered the Miaderm on amazon.com. Everyone, enjoy your weekend \"off\"! Tulips ",

I'm quite pale and I sunburn easily. But with 33 rads treatments, I came out with redness, but almost zero pain. No blisters, no raw skin, and so far no peeling. The last 5 days were boosts, so the skin outside of the boost area has been done for 9 days now, and looks great. I had always heard that things can get worse for up to a week after rads, and then get better. So my non-boost treated skin should definitely not get any worse, and I'm very happy. The boost area seems fine. The only thing that happened relates to fatigue. I had gotten though rads thinking I had no fatigue. Then yesterday for the first time, I was exhausted, in that weird chemo-fatigue kind of way. But I feel better today, and hope that was it. So anyone who has a tougher time, you have my sympathy!! I'm not here to brag, but to try to make it less scary for people just starting out--I got so nervous by all of the bad stories, so I promised myself I'd come back to report if it went well. Good luck everyone!! Tulips",

I had been so nervous about my skin, since I am very pale. So I wanted to post another good story for the newcomers--my skin has really held up. There is a redness/pinkness to it, but the skin doesn't hurt AT ALL. So my understanding is that now most of that skin can start returning to normal, and just the smaller area that receives the boost will continue to worsen. The skin texture is normal (not leathery or tight). I had another sim for the boost yesterday. They drew on me with sharpie, where the boost will go. I'd say it's about 20% of the total area that received the whole breast treatments. The only pain I have is brand-new: a sort of nagging feeling in my breast (deeper; not a skin issue). I don't like it, but I wouldn't really call it painful. Maybe just a 1 or 2 on a 1-10 pain scale. But I'll be glad to be done. For me, the worst part is the inconvenience...it's about a 25 minute drive each way, so with the time there, it's about an hour and a half daily. Otherwise, it's not a big deal, and it's really nothing compared to chemo. Obviously, I know that some people have much worse reactions (sorry!!), but I just wanted to post this for anyone who hasn't started yet and is nervous.  Good luck everyone! Tulips ",

I've had 4 session so far (closed on Christmas), and YIKES--yesterday their main machine broke so it was cancelled. Who knew I'd want to go to radiation so badly that I'd be very disappointed about a cancellation? But I\"m supposed to go on vacation on February 7th, so I don't have a lot of wiggle room for postponements. And that is a long-overdue celebratory vacation\u2026.I was diagnosed in late April, started 6 months of chemo in May, had my lumpectomy in November, and want to wrap this up!!! They think they'll be making yesterday up on Saturday, so maybe I won't get off track. Fingers crossed. Anyway, I've only had the 4 treatments, so no side effects yet. Thanks for starting this thread, I'm join got go back and read everyone's comments now. Happy New Year! Tulips",

As I mentioned, I lucked out and didn't have much skin damage despite being uber-pale. But the reason I'm not convinced about the creams is that I was lubing up like crazy! But it wasn't until the 4th week, when I started pinking up, that I realized I was missing almost 50% of the area that was being radiated. And both sections of skin (the part I'd been lubing and the part I had ignored) were identical. I used Aquaphor every night, and calendula in the early morning, and Miaderm right after radiation (I had bought all of these, so I thought I might as well use them all!). There is a big part of me that wonders if the reason they make such a big deal about the creams is because as patients, we like to think we have some control and influence over our outcomes, and it makes us feel good to play an active role. I guess I believe that maybe it makes a tiny bit of a difference, but I'm not convinced that it is super-important. Or, at a minimum, perhaps its importance varies by person, but I bet it's overblown. When people say, \"I used XXXXX lotion, and it totally worked for me!\", that's pretty meaningless, because they don't know how they would have fared if they hadn't used it. They might have been equally fine without it. But I'm not advocating you skip it--perhaps it helps, or at a minimum,I do think we feel better doing something that we think helps ourselves ;-) Good luck everyone, but don't beat yourself up if you miss a lotion-session!
