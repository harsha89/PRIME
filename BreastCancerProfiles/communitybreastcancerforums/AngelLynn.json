I am going to copy some of the descriptions below and would appreciate your feedback. I am very overwhelmed right now and have to wait 9 more days to biopsy. \"There are scattered enhancing foci in both breast. Some of the foci of enhancement are in a linear distribution in the right, outer breast. While the distribution is unchanged from the prior study there is increased enhancement intensity. Specifically, the most anterior of the foci in the right upper out breast is larger and show rapid rise and washout kinetics. Conclusion: Increased size and intensity with washout of the most anterior focus in the region of linear non mass enchancement. MR Guided biosy is recommened followed by repeat MRI if benign.

I have enough benign masses that a mammogram and ultrasound was unable to show pick up on the other mass due to the obstruction. This mass was uncovered on MRI and is adjacent to the axillary lymph node and is deep rooted. Due to the cluster of masses, he is recommending excision to ensure that pathology is done on the correct one. I work for the hospital as a nurse and that is why I saw the oncologist after seeing my results. He has NO doubt that it is malignant given the characteristics on the report and see the biopsy as a formality. I have 3 generations before me that have all had breast cancer. The push to get this done is to prevent the spreading of the malignant cells given the rate of growth and high risk for recurrence.",

I have had fibrocystic/fibroadenomas over the past couple of years but I had a MRI last week for a nodule and they found a 9cm x 5cm \"nonmass enhancement.\" I am now scheduled for a MRI guided biopsy next week. I am getting a little antsy given the size of the mass. I have had multiple biopsies but this seems so different. Doesn't that seem like a large mass? Am I overreacting? Log in to post a reply",

They want to do an excisional biopsy very soon and he wants the mastectomy done by the end of next week. I am only 36 years old!!! I have so many questions and would love some feedback from the group. I am lost and confused. HELP!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
