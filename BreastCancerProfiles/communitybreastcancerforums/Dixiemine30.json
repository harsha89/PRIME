Teach me to transform this suffering into growth, My great fear of tomorrow into faith in your presence, My tears into understanding, My discouragement into courage, My anger into forgiveness, My bitterness into acceptance, My experience with cancer into my testimony, My crisis into a platform on which I can learn to help others.

Nothing more freeing that getting rid of those boogers!!  Whew, I went 3 weeks with mine and was ready to take them out myself.  The first shower after was pure heaven :-) Driving - Be very careful.  I drove after 3 weeks (after drains removed) and then realized I should have waited.  I had a little fluid build up and ended up turning my TE upside down.  Yes, thats right, I fill one from the top and one from the bottom.  After that, I drove with my elbows by my side...and still do most of the time.  I'm 8 weeks out. Fatigue -- It was many, many weeks before I didn't tire out.  All you can do is roll with it and sleep when you need to sleep.  Yep...in the recliner, I was in mine for 28 nights. You are doing FANTASTIC for 2 weeks out!!  Happy healing to you...",
