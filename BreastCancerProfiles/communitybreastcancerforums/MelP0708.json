They got all of it and I thought I was home free until I had an Onkatype of 24. So, now 16 weeks of chemo followed by 4-6 weeks of radiation.I have had 2 rounds of CMF so far. I battle with some nausea and plenty of fatigue. The day of the actual infusion I get sinus pressure (from the Cytoxan), feel light headed the rest of the day, and sleep on the way home from treatment. The second round kicked my butt on Day 1 and I was up most of the night dealing with stomach pain, sinus headache, hot flashes, and nausea that made me salivate. None of the meds seemed to help but I was better the next morning. I am a little nervous about my 3rd round in 2 days. I have to agree with the worst part of the treatment being the constipation. 5 days this last time with enough Colace, Senokot, Miralax and high fiber foods that I thought I would be in the bathroom forever. It didn't work until the 5th day. Makes me think it's not worth the nausea pills. Other than that, I feel pretty good the second week. I try to exercise every day, except the day of treatment. Maybe that's what is helping me to feel pretty good. I don't know. Oh, and I drink enough water to drown a small animal every day. Luckily, I have no side effects from the Neulasta. I take Claritin with it just in case. Although they told me my hair should only thin out, I have lost so much hair already. It clogs the shower drain, comes out in my hand when I touch my hair, and always covers my clothes and whatever I sat on. I'm pretty sure I will lose all of my hair at this rate. Going wig shopping this weekend. Did anyone else experience any of this? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated! Thank you! Melanie",

I find I really don't like meat much at all, but really was never that big on it anyway. I think it's a great idea to start increasing your water intake. I prepared a little bit differently than you for my chemo. I went to Florida for a couple of days. The warmth of the sun in March and the sand in my toes helped me to be mentally ready for this next round.Now, I avoid the sun obviously, but it was great re-charging myself down there. I think the worst is the anticipation of the first treatment. It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought. I'm still working through my treatments and find the first week a nap after work and going to bed early are really helpful. I hope I've answered your questions. Melanie ",
