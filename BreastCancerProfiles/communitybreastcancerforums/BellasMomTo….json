I don't know if I received a \"complete response\" yet cause the path report won't be available for several days and my follow-up isn't until 4/10 (my surgeon is on vacation next week). Following surgery my chest was wrapped in an elasticized top -- remember the sundresses in the 1970s? It's the same elasticized bodice, but with velcro so it doesn't have to be slipped over the head. My BS said that I can remove the top and dressings and shower tomorrow. I don't have to cover the incisions (staples) or wear the top, just keep a bandage over the drain area. I only have one drain and it's only draining a little over 30 ccs -- I can get it removed when it's 30 or less. I was discharged from the hospital this afternoon. The BS offered to authorized another night stay, but the pain isn't bad. I have an RX for Norco. I haven't taken a good look at my chest yet. I'll do that tomorrow when I have to. Just wanted to share my experience cause everyone's experience can be so different. Thank you all for the well wishes!",

I'm having the opposite problem with my heart, but thought I'll post about it here in case anyone else has a similar issue. I don't think mine is related to chemo (I had TCHP), but who knows? Two weeks ago I was at a dog park and passed out. I wasn't doing anything -- just standing around and the weather was comfortable (high 50s/low 60s). I felt a twinge in my abdomen, then shortly after I felt tingly and told my husband before I collasped. I was only out for a couple of minutes, but when I came to I was unsteady. My husband drove me to the ER. I was able to walk-in. The admittance desk took my BP and pulse and took me in right away. In the ER, my heart rate was low -- it kept bouncing between low 50s and mid 30s so they admitted me. I was alert and felt okay, even when my HR was in the 30s. In the hospital I was hooked up to a heart monitor. They did blood work (all fine), chest xray (fine) , echo cardiogram (fine), and a treadmill stress test (passed with flying colors). They decided that my bradycardia (low HR) is probably normal for me, but don't know why my HR drops so low. (My BP is normal, about 110/60.) I was told I may need a pacemaker. I spent two nights in the hospital. Before I was released, they implanted a heart monitor in my chest. I have a transmitter in my bedroom and every night the recordings get sent to my cardiologist. If I have another episode or if my heart doesn't feel right, hopefully the recording will show something. If it doesn't, then the cause may not be my heart. I've been running on the treadmill for many years. I think my HR used to be in the 60s/70s (before BC), but now it's in the 50s and I wonder how low it can go w/o killing me. I know herceptin can cause heart damage, but my echos have always been fine. I can't help but wonder if chemo has caused whatever issue I have now. Anyone else with heart issues after chemo?",

I'm conscious of any abdominal 'feeling' because I had two abdominal abscesses in 2017. The first one was aggravated by/caused by chemo, not sure what caused the 2nd one 10 months later. (I passed out, went to the ER, and they did a couple of CT scans which showed another abscess. I was hospitalized for 5 days and put on IV antibiotics for 3 weeks.) So in the summer of 2018, I had a partial colectomy which should have taken care of the problem. This time there wasn't a need for a CT scan cause they palpated my abdomen and I had no discomfort what so ever. So, I don't know what happened. I don't know if a vasovagal syncope would cause the HR to keep dropping, even hours after. (During the 1st night in the hospital, my HR dropped to 30 as I was dozing off. The nurse ran in my room, I woke up, but felt fine.) One of the men who was there when I passed out, told me that his wife occasionally passes out too and Drs don't know why. She is also a BC survivor and has had other health issues. They wonder if medications she has taken in the past have anything to do with it.",

The first time I got a fever, I called the MO's office like I'm supposed to (for fevers of 100.5 or greater). They put me on antibiotics and sent me in for a urine test, blood test, and chest xrays. All came back negative. (One possible side effect of the antibiotics was ligament damage and my right calf developed spasms and cramping, which fortunately went away after about a week.) Since I didn't experience any other symptoms with subsequent fevers, I didn't bother calling the MO's office. I did let them know (after the fact) during my follow up appointments. I assume I'll have fevers again from this chemo round. I'll just wait it out and take tylenol to bring down the fever.

They had me go to the hospital for blood test, urine test, and a chest xray and put me on antibiotics for 7 days. My fever went away after a few days and all the test were negative. I developed fevers after each infusion (total of 6) that would last 2 - 3 days. (I'm bad though -- I didn't bother calling the MOs office cause I knew that the fevers would go away and I didn't want to have to go in for tests each time. I would tell my MO about the fevers at my follow-ups, and I would get scolded, but she admitted that's probably how my body responded to chemo.) After my 6th and final chemo, I had two bouts of chills. I shivered uncontrollably and my teeth chattered. Each lasted exactly 30 minutes. I'm 13 months PFC. My body temperature is rarely normal (98.6). My 'normal' body temp is about 97.5. And I get low grade fevers (99 to 100) for no reason. Sometimes they last for as long 5 days, other times just one day. So perhaps your fevers are just your body's response to chemo.",

Once I got out of bed and walked around the pain would subside. I never saw a Dr cause I didn't have a PCP at the time.

My \"D\" stopped being explosive when I started taking Gas-X. I recommend taking the 8 hour formula, I think it's called \"Ultra\". I didn't ice and didn't have any neuropathy. My hair started to fall out at the two week mark, which I think is typical. Glad you were able to enjoy the graduation. ",

It really hurt, but the dear Dr. kept talking to me about my dogs (both rescues) to keep my mind of the pain. That really helped. I assume that biopsies of tumors located in other parts of the breast don't hurt as much. ETA: Don't be surprised if you feel (slight stabbing) pain for weeks after the biopsy. I was told by a nurse that the pains are caused by nerves regenerating and it was normal.",

I'll continue on Herceptin for a full year. I'm scheduled to have my port installed on 11/8/16. It took almost 7 hours for my first treatment! I was told it would take \"a little longer\", but I didn't expect twice as long. And everything went smoothly too \u2013 I had no negative reactions to any of the drugs. They started each medication/drug off slowly, then after 15 minutes they sped it up. I received double doses of Herceptin and Perjeta so that added to the time. I can't imagine how long it would have taken if I had negative reactions. Yesterday I went in for my Neulasta shot \u2013 I took Claritin beforehand. So far, I'm managing fine. I haven't had any nausea (yet), but I am occasionally taking anti-nausea meds (Compazine) as a preventative. I took a lorazepam before bed on the night of my chemo (to help unwind me), but didn't take anything last night. So far, no constipation or diarrhea. I'm a little tired, but I'm still able to take my dogs on our daily one mile walks. As required, I took dexamethasone the day before and the day after chemo (they gave me IV dexamethasone before the meds), so I was told that I may be start to get a little ache starting two days after chemo. I did get a little flush (from the dexamethasone?) but that's fading. I'm eating my normal meals, but I'm afraid to eat out in case the diarrhea or nausea kicks in.",

Since I was told that surgery should occur 4 to 6 weeks after finishing chemo, that would have given them plenty of time to schedule my surgery. But they wouldn't return my call. I would call again and they wouldn't return my call. Weeks went by. Finally I complained to my Nurse Navigator and she contacted them and I finally got a call. My surgery date was 6 weeks after my last chemo. I was told to take it or leave it cause that's all they had available. I took it. I didn't have a choice cause I didn't have time to find another BS. This office also screwed up my port placement surgery. They cancelled my appointment and didn't tell me. I found out when I went to the hospital!
