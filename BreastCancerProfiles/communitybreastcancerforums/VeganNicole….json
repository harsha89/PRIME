I've met with Dr. Anne Favret (Virgina Cancer Specialists) twice now and I've come away feeling like the treatment has been rather impersonal and rushed. I have a rare type of breast cancer (invasive secretory carcinoma) and I want to feel as if my oncologist really CARES about my case and is interested in my treatment plan. Is that too much to ask? Would doctors reading this right now be rolling their eyes because obviously that's how EVERYONE who has breast cancer wants to be treated, regardless of how common or rare their type of the cancer is? And honestly, what I really want is a set up like at my breast surgeon's office. Dr. Stephanie Akbari at Virginia Hospital Center is great - and I can call her right-hand lady, Claudia, any time I have a question. Claudia scheduled all of my appointments for me (plastic surgeon consultations, the MRI). I want an oncology practice where there's real patient support and hand holding. This stuff may be routine for everyone who works there, but they need to remember that this is scary stuff for us patients!

All of the staff was friendly, and Dr. D was everything I was looking for. I am so happy that I can go to this location for chemo instead of Fairfax or Alexandria!!! Fran - I don't know if she does tumor markers, but I asked her what they are and she said that they're not useful in tracking early-stage breast cancer, which mine is considered. But if you're Stage 3 then maybe you would qualify for it, so maybe you could get an appt. with her to find out? They also respond to emails, so maybe you can reach out to their office via their website? http://virginiacancerspecialists.com/about/contact/",

I just wanted to quickly post about two things I just learned about which you may already be aware of - but you may not be.  Brian Joseph's Lash and Brown Conditioning Gel: http://brianjosephs.com/html/lash_brow_conditioning_gel.html A gal I met at a Young Survivors Coalition meetup on Monday told me about it and she just finished her treatments and still has all of her eyebrows and eyelashes!  There's $10 shipping but honestly $60 to keep my brows and lashes? Fine by me! Elasto-Gel Chemotherapy Hypothermia Cranial Helmet - from Amazon This is one of a few types of cold caps you put on your head to make your hair folicles resistant to the effects of the chemo. I guess you need to buy a bunch of them, but there's a company that rents them out, too. It sounds very cold and a bit painful, and perhaps it's too late to use them once we've started chemo, but I thought I'd pass it along just so people can say they've heard of it. I guess I just assumed it was a given that my hair would have fall out. No one ever mentioned this to me! ",

I'm staying busy, busy, busy in these days leading up to the surgery - I'll have plenty of time to sit on my butt once I get home from the hospital! Tonight I'm going to try out my friend's recliner which she offered to let me borrow to sleep in. I also bought a Comfort Motor Massage Plush Mat with Heat from Amazon to put on the recliner so my butt doesn't fall asleep from being in the same position all night! Every day now I think \"This is my last [Thursday] with my original boobs.\"...It's so weird to think about! And every time I look at my hair and think \"I need to get my highlights touched up.\" or try to comb out my long hair carefully so that I don't give myself split ends, then I realize, \"Ah, who cares? It'll only be around for another month anyway!\" I bought this kind of expensive eyelash extender liquid from Urban Decay in January before I got diagnosed...I never buy stuff like that but it sounded so awesome. And I only used it a couple times before I got diagnosed. Now it's just sitting around, not being used, until my chemo treatment is over in August. I'm trying to be intimate with my husband as often as possible before surgery since it'll be a while until we can do stuff again. I'm not shy about telling people my diagnosis. I was redeeming a gift card for my birthday and a coupon for a free pair of undies at Victoria's Secret last week, and a saleswoman walked up to me and said, \"I see you have the new blah-blah-blah underwear! Did you see the matching bra that goes with those?\" I said, \"Oh, I can't be buying bras right now...I'm having a mastectomy.\" The look on her face!! LOL... People outside of my immediate office at work have said, \"Oh, well enjoy your time off!\" and I can't resist telling them that I won't be on vacation...I have cancer. It's actually very freeing - and people are SO supportive. Instead of being irritated that I'm not here to do my job, they are concerned and kind. It's been really nice. (I'm sure I'm lucky in that respect - not everyone's office environment would be so cool.) I'm really curious as to what I'm going to feel and look like after surgery. I am eager to read more about what the other March surgeries are going through. It's so nice to have these boards to learn about the realities rather than what the doctors might say. I know everyone's experience is different, but these boards have really helped me feel more prepared. Thanks, all!",

Here are my notes so far: - Didn't need anything to entertain me while I was in the hospital as I had family with me and if our conversation was in a lull we could stare are the news on TV... - My mouth was soooo dry before and after the surgery. (I couldn't eat or drink from midnight on.) I was so glad that I'd read about bringing throat lozenges - those were a lifesaver! I drank so much water once I was awake, and then had to pee often, which meant calling in a nurse to unhook me and escort me to the bathroom door.  - The first time I got up to use the bathroom I threw up, but after that I was fine.  - I felt like I was getting a lot of conflicting information about what to do, what not to do, how to empty the drains, etc. so that got to be frustrating. I saw so many different nurses. I wish they would have just given me one set of firm instructions. - The drains are very, very annoying. I can't WAIT to have them removed! - My skin has been really itchy, and they said it was from the morphine, but it still bothers me now that I'm home on the Percocet - and I read above that someone else said that's a common side effect of Percocet, too. Benadryl helps with the itching at night and also makes me nice and tired so I can sleep...(During the day I'm just trying to not think about the itching and stay focused on doing other things.) - I'm nervous that I'm doing too much because I really do feel pretty good up until the last 30 minutes before my next pain pill, so I'm trying to just relax and chill out for a few more days so that I don't accidentally push myself too hard. I can extend my arms out to the sides and to my front, just not towards the back - so I need help putting on a hoodie or my robe. - Even though I borrowed a recliner from my friend, I decided to try sleeping in my own bed with lots of pillows to prop me up and that's been just fine. The recliner is great during the daytime though. Thanks to everyone for the tips - this site really helped to prepare me for my surgery and post-op time!! I get my full pathology report back today or Monday (I'm not holding my breath for today; I'm sure it'll be Monday - or even later - I never trust the time lines they give me). Fingers crossed that it's all good news...",

Note to everyone who still has their drains in: make sure your nurse/doc who removes the drains OPENS the drain bulb before they remove it. That way it's not suctioning the whole time it's being pulled out of your body. THAT is one of the things that can make it hurt, or if it gets kinked inside of you as they're pulling it out. Thankfully I didn't have that problem so it didn't hurt at all. Then visited my Primary Care Physician to get blood work and urine samples to test my liver function - I seriously hope it has calmed down. (Can't start chemo until it does.) I still feel sick to my stomach, but I don't want to take anything for it because I don't want to make it worse. I'm steering clear of the Percocet and alcohol (I'd started having some wine at night once I stopped taking the Percocet, but now I've stopped.) Then I met with a new oncologist (Dr. Neelima Denduluri at the Virginia Hospital Center) and had an AWESOME experience. Soooo much better than their practice's other locations. Phew! First chemo is now scheduled for April 25. (4 rounds of A/C and 4 rounds of T, all 2 weeks apart.) My stomach still doesn't feel good though. I tried to sleep on my side now that my drains are out but with my expanders in my chest it still felt uncomfortable, so I cried a little about that. I really am tired of sleeping my back!! Having to \"massage\" my chest with the expanders in it makes me nauseous and I can't help but cry because I look so yucky and it feels so weird. I woke up at 2 am feeling like I had acid reflux in my throat and ended up sleeping in a recliner just to be comfortable. It's like a preview of what it'll be like when I go through chemo, I imagine, that I don't feel like eating - in this case because every time I eat in the last couple days it makes my stomach feel sick. Blech...  But hey, at least I got the drains out and found an awesome oncologist! Gotta think positive, healing thoughts and remember my favorite saying: This too shall pass!",

I was in the emergency room all night after having abdominal pain, back pain, and a fever of 101. The doc found that my liver levels are waaaay high. But they couldn't figure out why after doing an x-ray, ultrasound, and testing for the flu, pneumonia, gallstones and hepatitis.  Now I had thought the pain was stemming from an incident where, on Monday night, clumsy me walked into a door frame while carrying a hardcover cookbook which jammed into my stomach/ribs. But they're looking into whether my gallbladder has something to do with these symptoms. I pointed out that the liquid in the drain on my right side has turned brownish, rather than light red like the other side's drain fluid...and when I emptied it early this morning while still at the hospital, the fluid smelled like rotten eggs! What the heck? Has anyone else ever experienced smelly drain fluid??",

Tomorrow I have an appointment to have the drains removed (and will talk with the nurse about these issues, because maybe we should keep that drain in if it's removing bad stuff?), then meet with my primary care physician for a follow up on all of this craziness, and then I'm meeting with the new oncologist that I was referred to (Dr. Denduluri). Busy day, but hopefully everyone will have some thoughts on what the heck might be going on. Maybe the Percocet affected my liver function? I took one yesterday when I was in so much discomfort...Hopefully I'll get some more answers soon!",
