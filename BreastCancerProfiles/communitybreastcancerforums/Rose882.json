My mom was a prime example among other women I have met under 30 diagnosed with bc. Just as I have seen many times in this group \"do not trust dr google\" I don't trust the graph you posted nor dr's that say \"bc dosen't hurt\" ha! My mom lived it, was told several times it was nothing then bam! Diagnosed stage 4. So once again, age does not matter. Cancer is no respector of persons nor age, I used to think it only happens in \"older\" women or if it run in your family..all lies. My mom was the 1st in our family.",

It has been going on for 4 straight months. Mammo and ultrasound fine waiting for the morons at the breast center to schedule my breast MRI after waiting 4 weeks for my insurance to approve it only to find out it was approved two weeks ago, between the breast center and my dr's office someone dropped the ball and both are blaming each other.",
