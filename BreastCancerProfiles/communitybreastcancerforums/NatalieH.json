The last round was 2 years ago.  I had 6 rounds of TCH.  Once every 3 weeks.  I would have my reatment on Thursdays because I needed to go in and have a Neulasta shot on the Friday after.  My first treatment was Dec 9th and by New Years I had to shave my head.  It was just falling out like crazy.  I did opt for a wig because I continued to work and I felt more comfortable. Some people believe in the real hair wigs although, I found the synthetic ones to be more comfortable. I found really good styles at a Merle Norman here in Illinois.  My avatar is a wig that I got from there. I really did not have any problems with Chemo until after the 3rd treatment.  I had more problems with the Neulasta shot because it made my bones hurt really, really bad. The only thing that would help was a heated blanket.  The Chemo gave me just a horrible taste in my mouth and nothing at all tasted good.  I think I finally just ate some raw spaghetti because I wanted a crunch of some sort and I new it really had no taste.  I tried to stay away from the foods I really liked because I did not want that taste to ruin my future likes for that food. I had to take alot of steroids because I was allergic to the Taxoll.  So it gave me restless leg and I had trouble sleeping.  Honestly, tylenol PM became my good friend during that time.  I also choose to have a port put in and I am so glad.  I am not a big fan of needles and with all the poking that was already going on I knew when it was chemo day I did not have to worry.  On chemo day, I was usually there from 8am to 3pm because of the allergy they had to run the IV's slow.  So stayed up late the night before because I really wanted to sleep as much as I could that day.  It just was very lonely.  Because of insurance issues I was not allowed to have someone sit with me, so they would drop me off and then bring me lunch.  I finished my chemo on March 24th and my Driver's Licenses picture was taken in Dec and at that time I was no longer wearing a wig but my hair was very short.  It has been  years now and it is just below my shoulders. One thing that I was not expecting was that my nails could fall out.  Be very careful of this.  It takes a long. long time for them to grow back.  I did not loose my finger nails but I lost my toe nails.  One other thing that I was not expecting was the out-of-pocket costs from my health insurance.  It seemed like some weeks my co-pays from seeing the Oncologist, Plastic Surgeon and the Surgeon totaled 200.00 a week, then there were prescriptions, ect...  My experience with family and friends is probably different then others.  I did not have very much support.  I don't know of it was because it was the second time that I had Cancer or if it was because my Dad had also committed suicide during my treatments but I had to do this on my own and it was very difficult. I wish you all the best.  You will do great !!!!  If you need any more answers, please let me know.   Natalie",
