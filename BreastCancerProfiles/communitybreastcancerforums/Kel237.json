I really have not been too involved in my treatment up until now reading all these blogs.  I guess i have been in denial thinking Stage 0 I am fine just let them do there job. Now I am getting really nervous about the radiation. Would you answer a few questions for me? Why did they not take out and test any of your nodes? Should I bring my husband with me for my first Rad session? They are combining my nurse/xray visit with my 1st rad dose this Thurs. I did get very emotional when I went in for the scan lst week, it was so uncomfortable on the table with my arm up for so long. I still have pain under my arm and thru my shoulder area(not sure if its pain from the breast or lymph area) I have been doing alot of shoulder stretching. Also should I be putting something on my breast to get it ready for Rad? I also had a 2nd surgery because of margins so I am not completely healed. Hope to hear back thanks for your post. Kel237",

The location of my DCIS was above the nipple towards the outside of my breast, maybe being so close to my under arm was why they took the nodes. Why no supplements? I was not told to stop and they ask me everytime for an update of what I take unless they will tell me at my nurse visit Thurs. I take Calcium, fish oil, garlic, vitamin D, low dose asprin all  mostly to keep my cholesterol down. I try hard to stay away from sweets thinking that sugar feeds cancer cells. I am using bio oil on my breast now hope this is ok. Will def ask about getting Biafine. Thanks so much for your help.",
