I had this procedure done 2.5 hours prior to my surgery. First they sat me in a chair and performed a mammogram. Then the radiologist came in and checked the location. He gave me two shots of numbing agent, but let me tell you IT DID NOT WORK! He then punctured the skin on the side of my breast with a needle and then introduced the wire. The wire looked about the size of a mechanical pencil lead. I will remember that for a long time. Next they performed two more mammograms to make sure the wire was positioned correctly. I've never had any problem with my earlier mammograms, but these last two were far from fun. The sight continued to ache up to the time of my surgery when the nurse was cleaning the sight and I could feel the sting where the needle had been injected. My biopsy was painless, and after my surgery wasn't too bad, but the needle localization experience was very painful. I hope this helps someone in the future. Currently waiting for gynecological oncology and genetic appointments to determine future treatment.",
