With this web site and your new found sisters, it will give you comfort and strength to stay strong. This time last year I was a mess. BMX, reconstruction and 4 rounds of chemo, and  hysterectomy. It was a long year but I made it through with my January Sisters. I pray for you and I pray for them everyday. God Bless. Donna ",
