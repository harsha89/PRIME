He told me to make sure the facility you are going to is certified so you can get decent imaging. As with anything, there are good and bad ones and you might as well get one that is good if you have to have one. You have a choice of where to get the MRI done.     ",

Mine is a screening MRI since I am very high-risk (mom died age 29, 2 of her sisters bilateral early and aggressive) but I'm 42 and healthy so far. Their first denial said that I have \"no specific family history to warrant it\" - oh yeah they went there... When I disproved that the story changed to \"experimental\" so I now have to disprove that. Yes I even called ahead of time to see if it was covered - I was later told that that was no guarantee of coverage.  As annoying as this process is for me, I can't imagine how bad it would be to have BC at the same time and have to deal with this insurance company nonsense. When I need to smile about how bad insurance companies are I think of The Incredibles when Mr Incredible is telling the little old lady how to navigate the system because he knows the system is wrong - it's even better when he punches his boss through a few walls....",

The gave me one address in their denial letter, a different address in their phone message, and still a different one is listed on their website. Like Dumbledore showing up 3 hours early for a hearing because he already knows they will try to screw him over (if I call to check the correct address I have zero confidence it will be the correct one), I am sending my appeals letter to all 3 addresses (and my doctor, and my radiologist, and my congressman...). ",
