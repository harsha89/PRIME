    "Content": "Beachygirl wrote: Ten years ago I had a lumpectomy with lymph node dissection. And it was drilled into me to not have blood draws or BP's on that arm, Now I developed a totally new cancer in the other breast so I had a bilateral mastectomy with lymph node dissection again. I had a real round about today at my doctors office and lab about where blood was going to be drawn. Is anybody getting any evidence that it is OK? Log in to post a reply",
