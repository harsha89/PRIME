I had 2 lumpectomies in November and December, then radiation in January. My last treatment was a week ago. Radiation is not supposed to cause nausea, so why do I have it? I usually work 12 hour day shifts in intensive care, but I just can\u2019t....so exhausted that I have to rest after a shower, again after getting dressed and brushing teeth. I only had 20 days of radiation, and the doc said this much fatigue should not happen from that so he checked blood work (CBC, basic metabolic, thyroid panel) but its all good. Hinting about depression/anxiety. I had just returned to work, part shifts at first, after collapsing at the desk. Full work up, 4 days inpatient, neurologist diagnosed stress induced silent migraine (neuro symptoms without the headache), so I was off the month of December for physical therapy. Seeing a psychotherapist for stress, but she thinks I have a good handle on it and doesn\u2019t know what else to do with me. (I did have a bout of clinical depression a decade ago with a divorce, and I don\u2019t feel depressed now, just frustrated; anxious to get my life back.). I\u2019m not malingering, I really want to function, so any input would be helpful",
