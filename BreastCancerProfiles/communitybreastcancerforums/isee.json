The cord was significant and tight, it must have been at least an inch in diameter. Very annoying when I tried to do anything with an outstretched arm. It appeared a few weeks after surgery as I was trying to resume exercises especially those that would allow me a full range of motion in the arm on the side of my surgery. I should say that I only had a sentinel lymph node biopsy...they removed 3 nodes I believe. When I stopped exercising, the cording went away. I am almost one year post surgery, have just started exercising again....so far so good....no cording. Just had my first Mammogram post radiation....and am waiting for hopefully an all clear...hope it doesn't take long. I did not have chemo btw...just two surgeries and radiation. I'm not taking tamoxifen. Good luck to everyone who is having this problem...I hope you are as lucky as I have been and it just goes away over time on it's own. I had Invasive Tubular Carcinoma",

They found a small lump in the right one on ultrasound and decided with my BRCA2 mutation and history that it needed to be biopsied. The radiologist said he didn't think it was cancerous as it is very round and tiny. The biopsy was a non-event. The most painful part for me was getting the little freezing needle right at the start (a tiny prick), and having to lay still for the procedure. I felt absolutely no pain. The doc had to really work at getting a sample as the lump was so small (4mm). I was able to watch the entire procedure on the ultrasound. Pretty interesting! He must have stuck that thing in my breast about 10 times....but I never felt a thing, thank goodness. He eventually got what he needed and the procedure ended. He said that I would probably have a bruise...but, now the next morning and I still have had no pain and there is no bruise! Amazing. Nothing to worry about if your experience is like mine! Now...the worst part of this whole procedure is the week I have to wait to get the results.....hopefully it will be benign.",

I did have an interesting experience yesterday...I had an appointment to see a doctor who has been treating me for vericose veins...he injects a saline solution into the vein and then it disintegrates or something (sorry, I should know the details...but you get the idea). Anyway, when I told him that I was a currently having radiation treatments, he said that he wouldn't be able to do the vein treatment as I would be at an extreemly elevated risk of developing a blood clot. Now I already knew that blood clots were a possible side effect of the treatment...although rare...but he said no, people who have cancer are much more likely to develop clots. He said to come back and see him after I have been on Tamoxifen for 6 months. I guess that if I don't have a clot in the first 6 months of taking the drug, that I'm probably not likely to. Interesting anyway I thought...not that we needed anything else to worry about. He told me to wear knee high compression stockings to try to prevent clots from forming. He also told me to lose 50 lbs...doh..he said I need to get to a 25 BMI...I haven't had a 25 BMI since I got pregnant with my first child. I'm really looking forward to going home for the weekend. 10 days living in someone else's space without a break is enough for me...but, the people I'm staying with have been outstanding! I have been feeling a bit tired too...I think the second day was when it started lol...I thought the same as everyone else...the literature says you don't get tired until the second or so week...strange. I'm still using the Glaxal Base..it works really well! No burning yet at all. I also like the idea of a lotto ticket a day...I'm going to go buy 16 tomorrow and I'll have a bonus scratching day to catch up to my treatments...Great idea ladies! Thanks! Ha ha...I have been counting during the treatment too...I am getting to about 250 each time. I find it keeps me calm. I don't know what it is, but I feel quite anxious during the treatment even though it doesn't hurt or anything...I think it is because my preconception is that radiation is bad in most cases...except this one.",

I lay on the table of a big machine....they position me with my arm up over my head....they leave the room and flip a switch and bzzzzzzzzzzzzz...by the time I count to 250 I am done. It's a snap....no worries and best of luck to you with your treatment...you will do fine! :)",

I will print that off and stick it to the fridge when I get home. Today I get treatment #15 of 16. One more sleep and I get to go home and stay home. No more sleeping on someone's couch! Not that I don't appreciate it, but I prefer my own bed lol. I have had no problems with the treatment. My skin is slightly pink...I have been getting more sleep then usual as I am on a medical leave from my job ...so I'm not feeling too exhausted. I do notice if I climb a big flight of stairs or go up a hill, I do get winded. My doc has still not told me if he has redone my risk assessment to see if he is going to change his mind on if I should take tamoxifen or not... Have a great day everyone!",

I am also getting a bit more tired. climbed a flight a of stairs and walked up a hill and thought I was going to collapse...sheeeeeeees. I will sure be glad when I can be back home and able to use my home gym and exercise bike. I'm really getting seriously out of shape. It's too bad they don't have a radiation machine closer to where I live so I wouldn't have to live elsewhere during treatment. That is the worst part of this whole situation for me. I am very lucky this week though, my daughter took some of her holidays so that she could spend the week here with me. We are going to play tourist for the next 4 days. May as well make the best of it!",

Lots of great advice etc. I'm all done my rads as of today and met with my oncologist this morning and decided not to do tamoxifen. Hope it is the right decision. He wouldn't give his opinion...just the stats on the risk of a reoccurrence with and without tamoxifen etc. The biggest concern for me seems to be the risk of blood clots and the fact that I have a tubular carcinoma which apparently rarely metastasises. He did say I would be closely monitored and if something came up it would be dealt with quickly. Anyone else not doing tamoxifen?",
