Onc said it was killing my bone marrow. I experienced nausea vomiting and fatigue. It has not been fun. I'm 3 weeks out and still not feeling good but it could also be that I'm weaning off steroids. I hope you do well. The chemo was working even half way through. The little buggers in my liver and chest shrunk or disappeared.",
