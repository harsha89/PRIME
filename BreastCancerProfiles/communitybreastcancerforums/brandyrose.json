I am two years out from finishing chemo, and I have barely any hair. The crown is super sparse, and I wear a wig everyday. The day I learned about all of the lawsuits in the United States, I pulled out all my paperwork on chemo side effects that my onologist had given me. Nowhere in there, did it mention permanent hair loss. It said temporary only, and in rare cases may take up to two years to come back. Well it's been two years, and I'm pissed. I contacted several lawyers to see how to go forward with this, but had no success. I eventually gave up, but I would love to see if there are other canadian women out there who have experienced the same as me. ",

I didn't have a family doctor at the time, and couldn't find anyone who was taking on new patients. So finally 5 days later I went into the Walk In Clinic. The doctor there did a breast exam, and then got me in for an ultrasound and mammogram. They happened the following week and then 4 days later I had a biopsy done. 1 Week after the Biopsy he told me the news.  There is no history of breast cancer in my family. I was absolutely in shock. I met with my surgeon the following day, and had my surgery scheduled for July 7th. He gave me the options. Lumpectomy with 3 weeks of radiation, and most likely chemo. Or Mastectomy with no radiation and definitely chemo. What a decision to have to make! I'm so glad my best friend was with me taking notes, cause my brain was way too overwhelmed.  I decided in the end to go with the mastectomy. I don't want to screw around. I just want to get through this chapter of my life. I've spent everyday trying to stay positive, and just be strong and brave. But it's not easy. My friends/family have been fantastic helping me raise money and taking me to appointments. But none of them truly understands. And how can they?  Everyday I wake up and remember, and it's like a punch in the mouth. I have cancer. Holy crap.  Thanks for listening, and if you've had a similar experience I would love to hear about it.  Brandy \"Courage means being scared to death but saddling up anyways.\" -John Wayne Dx 6/23/2014, DCIS, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 3/18 nodes Surgery 7/8/2014 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Surgery 8/13/2014 Lymph node removal: Right, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 9/29/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Ellence (epirubicin), Fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU, Adrucil), Taxotere (docetaxel) Radiation Therapy 2/26/2015 Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",

I feel sometimes like a shell of a person, like I'm internally broken but only my eyes really reflect the pain I feel. Otherwise I dress normally, add some blush so I'm not too pale, put on my prosthetic bra and wear a head covering. These are things I do to make other people comfortable while inside I'm screaming angry. Just wanted to let you know your not the only one who feels that way and I think it's perfectly normal. Sometimes I get resentful of just random women with their eyelashes and hair and normal chests. It's a hard thing, but your not alone. That's why I love this community.",

I've already had an appointment where I had a CT scan and got two small tattoos and am told I will get two more of them today. It's a bit awkward alright now as I dont always know where to go or what to do but I feel like I will be a pro before too long. Anyways, wishing everyone else luck! B",

On January 25th, I will be having a free tram flap breast reconstruction with a prophylactic left mastectomy (right was done 2 years ago). I am super nervous after reading lots of your experiences, and weighing the pros and cons of tram vs diep. My doctor recommends the tram, but I wonder if it's the right decision. Anyways, I've been through a few surgeries now (fractured my ankle last year too), but I'm wondering if there is anything I should be preparing for specifically for this? Or anyone have a hospital list they use? Anyways best of luck to everyone in this group. At least it's a step forward.",
