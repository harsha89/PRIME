[i dont normally drink soda so we dont keep it in the house - guess that'll be changing!]   other than that, the port's really not a big deal....  even went blueberry-picking for two delightful hours this a.m. & enjoyed Every Second!!  Yayyy.  i just Love when the anticipation turns out to be a bigger issue than the actuality, don't you? on the wig topic, has anyone looked into tlcdirect.org?  the ACS sent a catalog and i checked them out online - went a lil crazy & bought enough scarves, hats, bands, the works for different looks practically every day til this is Over!!  ya.  i know.  anyways, their wigs are really attractive as well and very reasonably priced.  i ordered a really cute lace front that was on sale [the lace fronts are a little steeper priced.] as well as a couple shorter \"normal\" [i.e.lower priced!] wigs.  they're all pretty nice looking - except i still have Way too much hair to try them on comfortably.  i've been practicing my scarf tying, following directions from YouTube & might Even be good at it by the time i need them! oh, also go here: www.bandanas.net/special.htm for some Outstandingly Beautiful scarves/bandanas for cheap as well as freebies.  i almost can't Wait to start wearing them - how bad is That?? michelle, your short do is adorable!   i hope you thoroughly enjoy your weekend.  ellen, i can't help but get psyched for you w/all that great energy!!  hope it lasts & lasts & lasts.... thanks too for the anti-nausea info.  after the heaving i went thru post-port, i'm fairly certain that's Not something i want to repeat.  GAHH.   doodlebug, you break my heart, woman!  it seems as though your family is trying to dictate how you should live this treatment....it's Your body & Your life - please stand up & be counted!!  if you feel that you'd be more comfortable & happier w/your self-image w/a wig, then Dammit, get one!!  the idea that you need to sneak around shopping for something that would make you feel better during this crapola just ticks me off!! yvette, go ahead & stimulate our economy - whatever helps, right?  & Yay that your kids get to enjoy the Real you!! have a sweet rest of the weekend, dear friends.  rox- out",

Jillejo, welcome to a club of strong beautiful women who Love Life & arent afraid to live it!  you & i have the same dx & tx - it's good that your nodes are clear, as well. my intention is to continue working like you, jill.   i had to take this by the horns yesterday - had some heavy internal pep talks w/myself but now i'm not just Saying that i'm positive....I AM!!!   it's nothing to dread, fear or that we cant handle - hell, look at all the crazy stuff that we women deal w/day after day!!!  one day @ a time, one step @ a time, we can DO this!!! i'm sorry i cant get around to commenting on everyone's posts [my life just doesnt allow it!] but you all offer so much wisdom & grace in your messages, i wish i could have heart-to-heart conversations w/each of you. it's really an honor to be among such kind souls - bless your hearts, one & all. sleep well & have sweet S/E Free days & nights ahead.  <3 rox-out",
