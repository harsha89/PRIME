Yeah, that's me. Anyway I finally made an appointment but because my breast are fiberous (Sp), like my mom's , my dr had ordered a 3d mammogram. I of course scheduled it at the wrong place. Luckily the radiology lab was wonderful and found me another appointment the next day. I went in not expecting much. I was warned that often times with first mammograms you get called in twice because they are trying to get a baseline for future ones. So when I got a call last Tuesday I didn't worry about it, even though they said something was up with my right breast. I went in Wednesday and they took the second set of mammograms (Even then I didn't really think much of the fact they only took pics of one breast) I figured the first ones weren't clear or something. I then was sent back to wait. That is when I began to worry a little particularly when several other women also waiting came and went with clear results and I was sitting there...waiting. I started to stress more when they called me back for an ultrasound, and relaxed again when they found nothing, and then stressed again, of course when I was told I needed a biopsy. I had that on Friday. I am waiting for result. I had BIRADs of 4 for calcifications that are loosely grouped calcifications that are indeterminate in the lateral mid depth right breast. I have no idea what it means, I wasn't prepared to take notes. So I am just waiting. I hate waiting... Now I am off to work for a bit and a meeting and more work. I hope it is a distraction... the soonest I hear will be tomorrow and the mammogram tech or radiologist said she didn't think it was anything but she has been wrong before. But she gave me I BIRADs of 4. The person who did the biospy said calcium was found in the calcifications at least I think that is what she said, I was reading her scanned copy on my computer.
