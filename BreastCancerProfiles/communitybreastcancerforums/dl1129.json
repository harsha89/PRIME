    "Content": "Apr 19, 2019 02:28PM - edited Apr 19, 2019 02:28PM by dl1129 I was unsure about the boost too. I kept changing my mind about it. My RO recommended it primarily because I had a 1 mm margin at the skin (no breast tissue left to take) but she agreed the added benefit to me is likely to be small. I was prescribed 16 whole breast treatments and a boost divided into 4, so 20 total. I did all but the very last day, so 16 whole breast and 75% of the boost. My main side effect has been feeling generally unwell (my skin and nipple darkened a bit but not too bad) and after the 19th treatment yesterday my resistance suddenly skyrocketed. I just felt I could not do anymore as I desperately needed to start feeling better. All that said, I didn't notice any difference at all with the boost (other than that I was very grateful I was prone for the 16 whole breast because the supine position was very uncomfortable for me). I was honest with my doctor throughout the process and said I was going to take the boost one day at a time\u2026 she was accommodating.I'm proud of myself that I did most of it and happy with my decision. Good luck!",
