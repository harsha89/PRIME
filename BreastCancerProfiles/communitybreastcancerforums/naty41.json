However, I will not delete it as maybe someone will see it. So far I find this site very helpful to answer questions my Doctors haven't answered. I do a lot of reading here but don't post much as I have more questions than answers. I find that chat is a good place to go to when I have questions. Many of the people in chat have excellent recommendations. Maybe you should try chat for awhile.",
