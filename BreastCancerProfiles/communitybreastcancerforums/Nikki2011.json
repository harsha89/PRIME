I just had a ultrasound done birads 4 on right breast a mass and thickened lymph nodes suspicious. I had a clip put in my breast after eight samples of the mass and three of the lymph node. I've been having night sweats, fevers, swollen lymph nodes and many more symptoms as more show up. I'm so scared that it is cancer. With weight loss and everything going on over 48 months my body's tired. I hope I get these results soon. I had a peripheral blood smear test done results are reactive. Has anyone had any of these things also ?",
