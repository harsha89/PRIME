Tamoxifen for 5 years. 2015 November,stage IV after months of back pain. MRI found tumors in bones. 2015 Sept had brain surgery to remove meningioma. Was benign and maybe not related to Cancer. Taking Ibrance, letrozole and Zometa. Feeling relatively ok. Some back pain. On 10th cycle. Still only in bones. Attended DCIF MBC forum. Updates on treatments and trials. Sharing of experiences. Nice to meet some women from Ibrance discussion board, also someone from my graduating class.Would have liked to meet them at some other forum! But good to share.",
