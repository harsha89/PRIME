This organization provides trips to Disney World and New York City to families with a parent with a life-threatening illness (not just breast cancer). I found out on Thursday that my family has been selected. Yippee!!! Ever since I got married 2 years ago, I've wanted to take our boys, but our finances and my illness have not allowed. My husband has a 9-year-old son and my son is 15. They love each other so much, which is a blessing. I'm hoping the ex-wife will allow my stepson to attend. She wouldn't let him attend a family cancer retreat in May, which broke my heart. I want to share info about the two organizations, for other ladies who may want to apply. Little Pink Houses of Hope, www.littlepink.org, has separate retreats for families and couples facing breast cancer. Transportation isn't provided, but all other expenses are paid for the week-long trip. One of the many joys of the week were photos taken by a professional photographer at the Cape Hatteras lighthouse, as seen here. Free of charge! Inheritance of Hope http://www.inheritanceofhope.org has 4-day retreats for families, with transportation covered. Both of these organizations are based in my home state of NC but are open to residents of all states. These are worthy organizations for donations, too. If my health allows, I'm planning to volunteer with LPHOH in 2014. Applications are pretty easy to complete, FYI. Ronda - Extensive mets to lungs & bones. 9/13, subcutaneous skin mets.
