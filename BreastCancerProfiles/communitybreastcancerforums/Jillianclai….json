I still have some pain the the area. My doc said that it might be due to movement, which would be a good thing. Like the tumors just fall off and die?! Or...it's all in my head. My breast tumor still burns from time to time to remind me that it's the little you know what that started it all. Thanks for all the well wishes from my liver sisters",

I've been told my onc is impatient and likes to know if stuff is working. Will it help if they take the breast tumor out? I know that sounds like a dumb question. I wish they'd remove the liver tumors but I bet that's not as easy. As anyone had their liver tumors removed",

I get a ctscan on Monday and I'm worried. I discovered the liver mets after I went to the hospital with liver pain. It was awful. Now that I've done 4 rounds of chemo the pain is gone. I hope hope hope that the scans will show good things cause so far they've all been pretty horrifying",
