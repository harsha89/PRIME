Had Pet scan in November, breast and lung mets gone!  Bone mets for the most part were gone too, I only had a slight tic of one in left femur. Great news for the holidays..remission! Onc removed me from the Carbo and for the last three months I only received Taxol and Zometa. Well two weeks ago I felt the lump in my breast and she ordered Pet. Got results yesterday and as I guessed the monster is back in my breast/axillary,  lung nodule increased from 4mm to 9mm. I also have a mass in mediastinal! Only slight progression in bones. Not the news we ever want to get! My onc wants to try Avastin next if approved by insurance. She said we use it now or will be unable to down the line. No chemo for me yesterday which has put me in a panic...hopefully something will start next week. I picture the cancer having a grand party inside my body! My Dr also wanted to re-biopsy my breast and make sure my receptors are correct (first biopsy not done where I'm going now) they put me in a program which will test for my bio-markers and provide more detail. This will help in treament choices and it was at no cost. Went yesterday for biopsy. I am hoping for a change in my receptors because my ER+ is only 7% and she looks at me as a triple negative! This is not good!  Wow am I lucky or what? I am not only Stage IV out the gate but triple neg too!  I am feeling really down today and feel like I'm loosing this battle!

We really want to see the Rangers win, they have never one a World Series. So I would trade a victory tonight if the docs would let you go home to your babies! Get well soon, much love~",

I just started round 7 of Taxol, had 6 rounds of Carbo/Taxol with great results. I am in remission even though I have one small spot on left femur and spec in lung. My labs are picture perfect and my tumor markers continue to go down. I thought with such great results I could try a hormonal. I trust my Onc completely and do not want  her to think I doubt course. She talked like we could dial back the strength and or take breaks but I am so freaking tired! I seriously have sat in the recliner in my robe and gown for the last three days. I only got out for church and am in bed by 8:00! I hate having no hair, eyebrows or eyelashes. I have no other SE's other than slight neuropathy and if this worsens tx would change. I guess my question is, has anyone else been on chemo for extended periods of time? Do they continue with this chemo until progression only to move to another chemo?

Sometimes we need days to let it all out crying, I know it makes me feel better. I hate not having any energy and think I should be doing something fun or making memories since my days are numbered and yet I sit with my laptop or sleep! I get so mad because I just don't understand why I have this stupid cancer!  I hope you are having a better day today and so thankful we both have DH's who listen to us and comfort us when we cry!",
