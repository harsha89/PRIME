I decided to pursue the ACTH approach after deliberating and analyzing the pros and cons and frankly, after my oncologist took one hour and more of her time to explain in detail the whole process to me.  In LA, some hospitals such as UCLA are opting for TCH, which has proven to be very effective in the adjuvent setting (after surgery) and less side effects in regards to the heart.  However, there doesn't seem to be enough research that supports the use of TCH for HER 2 in the non-adjuvent setting (doing chemo first) and my oncologist explained this to me very well.  But top hospitals all over the U.S. still administer the AC TH chemo protocol...a tough decision...wish me luck!",
