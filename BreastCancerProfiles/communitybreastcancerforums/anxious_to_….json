I didn't even know there were options for type of reconstruction or if I can elect mastectomy with early DCIS........ It's a very personal decision as everyone says so I better start reading. My surgeon may say lumpectomy, but my breasts are small and I don't know if that's even going to be possible. MRI was hideous. I wonder what it will show? Why would you choose one type of recon over the other? I just assumed silicon. But now there are more things to think about. Why did you choose what you did? Thanks so much I keep thinking maybe I don't have BC. Maybe it's a mistake. But the path report says DCIS so I guess I do.  ",

One minute I'm fine, the next I'm planning a holiday with my family with certainty that the results will be bad. I hope for benign but aknowledge if that benign was a guarantee they wouldn't be subjecting my poor breast to all these awful tests  Yes MTwoman I need to breathe better! I thought they were going to end up doing the needle draining (whatever that was) and the biopsy in the wrong spot I was freaking out so much. They were lovely though",

The biopsy was benign as were the aspirated fluids and the discharge from my nipple. Unfortunately the biopsy has really annoyed that duct as I am bleeding fresh blood all the time now and need to wear a breast pad.  Surgery next week for duct removal, surgeon said 90% chance papilloma, 10% chance DCIS. Won't know until it is tested I think, so two more weeks waiting.  I don't like the odds, I would prefer 100% chance of benign. Yike",
