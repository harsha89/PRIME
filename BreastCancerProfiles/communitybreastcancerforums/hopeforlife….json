Pleaural effucions whether exudative or transudative are concerning however there are many benign conditions that can cause them. So a couple of questions for you: 1) Did you have a recent CT of the chest? And if you have, did it show any signs of mets? 2) Seems like you had a similar scare couple of years ago. I am sure they must have sent your effucion for cytology. Do you remember what it turned out to be? I wouldn't paniic at this point. Seems like you have had scares like these before and they turned out to be benign. Keeping my fingers crossed for you and please keep us posted with the results of your findings.",

The main point of that article was that diabetics are not treated as aggressively as their counterparts who do not have diabetes, hence diabetics have a higher chance of a rucurrence from an early stage BC.  However, the following article contradicts the above stated findings by supporting the fact that Diabetics taking metformin have a higher response rate to systemic therapies and thus have a lower chance of a recurrence compared to diabetics not taking Metformin or NON-DIABETICS not on metformin. The point is that having diabetes is not a poor prognostic marker, if anything it may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.  For some reason I can't copy paste the link but here is the URL: www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/053111/page6",
