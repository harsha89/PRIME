I took a bracs test yesterday and it takes about 3 weeks to get the results back from thAt..but that will determine weather or not I have a double mastectomy or not.being as I have no history of bc my surgeon and I felt it was a good test for me because I do have a history of other cancers....but you came to the right place cause as I was having my pity party for myself because I was overwhelmed I found there are so many other women fighting this fight with us....so when you feel sad and alone and why me remember we are all here for  you and have all been or are in your shoes and know how your feeling to an extent....we all handle it in our own way but we are here for you nevertheless..I first thought my fatigue was from stress I was recently married in april and the day of  my wedding 3 hrs before my sister had a stroke brain aneurysm...at 46..never in a million yrs did I know my body was fighting bc...but I have  plan and I got something for sleep and to take the endge off and now im ready to take off my heals and figgt some bc butt!!!! right along the side of you..with you!!
