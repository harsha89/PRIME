Oncologist said that the Mammoprint test came back so low risk that it wouldn't benefit me by getting radiation.  I'm not complaining here, just have that constant worry that we all wake up with.  Also, he said no scans are necessary anymore.  At all.  I just take their word for it that it's all OK? ",
