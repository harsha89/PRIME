      "Content": "lefty37 wrote: I have 4 fibroadenomas in my left breast. 2 were biopsied and 2 monitored. I got busy and it took 9 months for me to return...since it has almost been a year they did mamammogram on both breasts. All clear on right and ultrasound showed no growth on the 2 that had not been biopsied so given benign conclusion. it has been barely a month and I now feel a lump in the right breast at about 9 o'clock. Not too big and seems like it feels similar to the one in left that I can feel. I would like to wait and see if it has anything to do with my cycle. I had bilateral breast mri in May of last year and nothing found on right breast so I would imagine it would have shown up there if it were something that was overly concerning. Any thoughts on a reasonable about of time you would monitor to see if it were cycle related? A few weeks? A couple of cycles? It is probably a fibroadenoma.... don't they usually show up in both breasts? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

She may be right...but I would definitely be bothered if you and dr feel the masses but do not see them. If I were in your shoes a second opinion would not be out of the question...And would at least help ease your mind. Good luck to you.",
