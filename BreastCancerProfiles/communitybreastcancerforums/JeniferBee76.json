    "Content": "JeniferBee76 wrote: I had my first mammogram yesterday which showed scattered areas of fibroglandular density but no mass or architectural distortion in either breast. There are a few indeterminate tiny calcifications suspected in the lateral right breast seen on the CC view only. I'm lucky because I was able to get an appointment tomorrow at the Betty Ford Breast Cancer Clinic. It's recommend that I get a right ML view and spot mag right CC view. I'm an anxious person by nature so of course I'm running through all the worst case scenarios. (Though I am calmer than I expected to be since I'm usually one to full blown panic.) I suppose there's no real reason for my post outside of it feels good to write it out and not feel alone. Take care, Jwn Log in to post a reply",
