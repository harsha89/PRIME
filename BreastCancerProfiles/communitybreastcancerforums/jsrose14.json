If you actually look at your oncotype test results you will see two predictions as I just mentioned. A score of 18 and under is considered to have a lower recurrence rate meaning the tumor is not as aggressive as well as chemo not being indicated. When I was diagnosed two years ago they didn't do the oncotype if the lymph nodes were affected bc once it has been found in the lymph nodes chemo is indicated regardless of oncotype score.  It's a very difficult decision. I was an 18 with no lymph nodes but chose chemo due to my age and a discrepancy on my pathology. If you aren't sure ask for a second opinion on your pathology.  Good luck!  Jrose",

The two other places-one of which is the place I did my surgery both said that I was negative for lvi. I was surprised but at the same time I am now being recommended for cmf chemotherapy. While she still feels that the benefit may be low in terms of the actual benefit she still feels that these cells have figured out how to travel so we should treat it like they are moving. I guess I am relieved that I have a firm opinion finally. I would definitely recommend getting more opinions if you are unsure of treatment. I think it's amazing that we are basing our tx from a nameless faceless pathologist that we never get to meet! I guess I will be surfing the chemo boards! Jsrose",

I am wondering if anyone else with low oncotype scores but higher grade tumor chose or didn't chose chemo and why. my MO also explained that the onctotype pretty much trumps all of the other pathology. i had a hi KI67 score with poorly differentiated cells but that because my score was in the low range and there were no nodes and it is hormone receptive that chemo would not be recommended. that being said she definitely said there are women who still chose it--not exactly sure what i am feeling right now but would love to hear more from others with similar situations or what those of you are hearing from you MO if you have had your appts yet! thanks, jsrose",
