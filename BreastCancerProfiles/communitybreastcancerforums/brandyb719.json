      "Content": "brandyb719 wrote: Hi everyone, I went in for my first ever mammogram at the age of 34 a few Mondays ago. They called me to say they found something in my left breast and they were requesting me to come back for an ultrasound. Let me make it be known my Mother had Stage 4 breast cancer so it's heavily pronounced in my family. I went for the ultrasound and shortly there after, the Dr. walks in and says he is recommending a Ultrasound - Guided Breast Biopsy because there is a 1.2 cm mass that looks malignent (but of course he can't be sure). That is now scheduled for Friday but I am absolutely consumed with fear of the pain from this procedure and the results. I'm trying and trying to find out how bad a biopsy is and there's very few resources from people who've actually undergone such a thing. I would appreciate any advice or experiences you could share regarding your biopsies. I just want to know what to expect. Thanks so much ;) Log in to post a reply",

They keep telling me \"oh stop worrying\" or \"this is not that bad\" or whatever other non sympathetic answer they can spit out of their mouth. My apologies for my frustrations. I've got a small support system here at the homestead even if it does turn out to be nothing. I just wish I had answers to questions like: Why do I have to even go through a painful biopsy? If you saw a marble sized mass in my breast, why can't it be my decision that you just take it out so I never have to worry about it ever again? Why can't you sedate me? Why do I have to go to my family doctor and beg for meds? What should I be asking for? I'm already an anxious person taking xanax twice daily so what would you recommend, Dr.? I'm also diagnosed depressive so tell me how I'm supposed to remain so happy go lucky and positive?!? Ugh, wow......I really am a mess with this whole thing.",

I am certainly not the first nor last to go through something like this and by seeing all of your signatures, it puts things into perspective for me. I went to my mental doc today. She wasn't very compassionate and gave me my normal round of xanax and pushed me out of the door but not before making me promise her that I would be brave. I'm not sure what to make of her sometimes. What they are doing is an \"Ultrasound-Guided Breast Biopsy\". I've made the mistake of looking it up on youtube. I find myself back here though. Reading your messages and can say definitively I feel fortunate to have found this community. Thank you all for helping me through this.",
