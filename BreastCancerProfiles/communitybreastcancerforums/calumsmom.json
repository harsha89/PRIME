    "Content": "calumsmom wrote: After a routine mammogram and MRI, I was surprised to get a call a week later asking me to come in for a core biopsy. Of course I was worried. There were three areas of concern that showed up on the MRI (mammogram was clear). Since my last MRI a year ago, one new mass had formed and two more had grown. Knowing the details didn't make me less concerned!! I went in a week later for the core biopsy (procedure didn't hurt much, but I'm still a bit sore a few days later). The radiologist spent ages taking samples; she was very tight lipped throughout the biopsy, but when she left the room, she said \"Good luck\" and I drove myself crazy trying to analyse what she meant?!?! After the procedure, the nurse told me the radiologist thought one lump looked benign, but as for the rest -- \"we'll see\". UGH, NOT what I wanted to hear! Had an appointment with the Rapid Diagnostic clinic two days later. Since the call asking me to come back for the biopsy, I hardly slept for a week; these past two nights since the biopsy have been especially bad. I kept praying and praying and hugged my 8 year old a little tighter than usual every day. Today was diagnosis day. As I sat in the waiting room, my nurse from the biopsy came over and whispered to me \"I'm not supposed to tell you this, but it's benign! When you see the doctor, act surprised!\" LOL, I told her she was an angel sent by God!! I was certain it was going to be bad news. The official diagnosis is Fibroadenoma. Will need to be followed every six months for the next two years. Biopsy does not equal a cancer diagnosis!! Edited to add: I read my report a few days later... was stunned to see the words \"BIRADS 5\". I am so glad I didn't know this information before my biopsy. I was wracked with worry as it was; I couldn't imagine knowing that my chances of a benign lump were 5% or less. So not only does \"Biopsy not equal a cancer diagnosis\", but incredibly, neither does BIRADS 5. Praise God!! :) Log in to post a reply",
