She was doing really well but she fell at the football game coming down from the bleachers and hit her right breast. Now she is scared she might have messed up something up. I am also her hairdresser so when we were doing her hair today we were talking and she told me about her fall and she is really worried and I said maybe we could find a support group for people who have had reconstruction and find someone who had something similar happen. She is a little hesitant to try and do things on a computer so I wanted to see if I could find such a group. I found this group and wanted to see if I could find any answers for her and then I will help her with getting registered and all so she can use this group for information and meeting people who have been thru similar situations. Sorry I have gotten long winded, back to her problem. She said her breast is painful and swollen to begin with but it didn't bruise it did kinda of dented or sunk in but now it is more like a knot or lump and she was thinking it might just be swollen but she is worried. She said she wanted to wait and see if the swelling went down before going to her doctor.  I am hoping someone else might have fell and maybe experienced this and have some tips for her. Thank you in advance for any help. Log in to post a reply",
