If you decide to go for a second opinion at the cancer treatment center, you should definitely be able to have their suggestions implemented by your local team - I go to Dana Farber (between 30 min to 1:30 commute depending on traffic) for my treatment but have several friends who are treated elsewhere in MA and in NH. Many of them have been referred to DF for second opinions by their MO's. There seems to be a general comfort here with getting direction from a teaching hospital? If I had needed radiation, I would have had it done locally. I hope that your waiting period is relatively short and you get started soon on treatment. My friends who are treated locally receive more scans and speedier surgeries in general! You sound very calm -- that's amazing. If at some point you are feeling scared and just need emotional support, there is a \"social\" thread called https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/84/topics... I don't often post on BCO, but have made 2 close friends through BCO. The women on the crazies thread are very friendly and supportive, a very kind group. But, as I said, I do not post often...

I was diagnosed with bilateral ILC after my PCP felt a thickening in my breast. (ILC in left breast discovered AFTER prophylactic bilateral mastectomy.) It definitely sounds like your surgeon is thorough with scanning! My ILC was not clearly visible in imaging -- larger than expected... nothing seen in nodes on MRI - they were found after surgery to be positive. ILC can be sneaky... You are in the most difficult phase of all this! My doctors never offered medicine for my nerves -- I could have used some! You are wise to request something. Once you have your surgery and reports from pathology, you will be able to move forward with a treatment plan, and that is calming. I do not see above - did you mention an appointment with a medical oncologist? I saw mine early on to know their thoughts on a treatment plan. The surgery that you choose will sometimes affect whether you have radiation... I met with a team of doctors (breast surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist) soon after my diagnosis. I also secured a second opinion early on... I received 2 totally divergent treatment plans from 2 different hospitals' tumor boards. A second opinion can help to clarify things or complicate the decision process... It depends on your personality whether you will benefit from 2 approaches. I hope that you are able to bring someone with you to appointments where you are discussing treatment options -- sometimes when I was receiving \"bad\" news, it was difficult to listen closely to the doctor's words. You will want to be able to refer to notes from appointments when making decisions -- my husband took notes for me. I am sorry that you are having to deal with this. But you found BCO! It will be a huge comfort. Best",

The tumor (ILC as well) in my left breast (not palpable) was found at prophylactic mastectomy, along with several pre-cancerous conditions ( I had weird twinging sensations in the left breast and armpit. I never had the sensations on the original cancerous right side.) I had mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI on the left side where so much was lurking. Nothing suspicious showed. I did have a benign fibroadenoma seen and biopsied on the left side prior to my BMX. If you have concerns with dense breasts, I would push for a thorough evaluation. Once I knew that I would need a MX on the right side, I am glad that I chose BMX despite being told repeatedly that it was not medically necessary. Women sharing on these boards imparted the wisdom and courage for me to make the best choice for myself. With dense breasts, getting the lump thoroughly evaluated by several methods will give you peace of mind - and remember, lumps are usually benign.",

I feel like finding the right PT experienced in MX patients was key for me. My first young PT was essentially useless. Well, I did rebuild strength, but the pain/tightness in my chest was debilitating. My first therapist did not do any massage but showed me stretches and resistance exercises. The stretches helped minimally. I had almost immediate relief after seeing my second PT, who did massage to break up the scar tissue. Massage by my PT continues to be key for me. I still see this PT for tune-ups (knees, back, neck, side and shoulders) weekly -- I pay. It changes my whole outlook on life when I walk out of there without pain. The musculoskeletal SE from AI's have been difficult for me. My Breast Surgeon, head of Breast Surgery at Brigham and Women's/Dana Farber, made no referral or recommendations -- I requested the prescription for PT. He did not offer anything other than connecting me with a prior patient who speaks publicly about breast cancer.

My MO (at Dana farber) was the principal investigator on this trial -- there was no discussion of an AI until months later (after leaving trial) when the results of the SOFT trial were published -- then I had an oophorectomy and tried the AI's.

I started at 125 mg of Ibrance but had to have the dosage lowered twice (To 100 and then to 75) due to low neutrophils, not rebounding to the threshold of 1.0 on week off. I left the trial after 6 cycles due to persistent low neutrophils (below threshold) and intense fatigue. If I had been stage IV, I believe that we would have made a more concerted effort to continue on Ibrance? Since I was not stage IV, there was no way to gauge if I was benefitting?

BCBS covered mine even though I do not have lymphedema in my arm, just possibly truncal. Maybe if PT codes it or orders it, your insurance might cover the sleeve then? They should know which sleeve would fit you well. My PT also recommended Lymphedivas to me - for cuteness factor, I believe.",

I gradually increased (starting soon after surgery) up to 200mg 3X/day and then tapered down. It took away the extreme sensitivity. I would say intense pain lasted for maybe 3 months post surgery. At 2 months after surgery, I started physical therapy. This helped mostly with shoulder stiffness, but not chest discomfort. Wearing compression tops seemed to decrease my sensitivity. In the past 2 months, MLD massage has significantly improved my chest sensation and eased tightness and hyper-sensitivity. Since starting MLD with my new physical therapist, I have started to feel more natural - like my pre-surgery self.",

My MRI did not show cancer or pre-cancers on the prophylactic side (had Bilateral Mastectomy due to Invasive Lobular Carcinoma not showing up on most imaging). So, I understand your fears. I originally had a lumpectomy and needed a re-excision due to un-clean margins. Then with \"dirty\" margins again, I went with the BMX. I am glad that I did (since they found so much in the other breast). However, you have IDC, which is usually visible on imaging? I hated having to make all these decisions without a medical degree. You will need to figure out what you are comfortable with -- not always easy. Will keep you in prayer. Others should post -- it was a holiday weekend for many.",

I was fine after the first few times stripping the drains. I did not have reconstruction, but believe that not raising your arms is key for those who do; so, as suggested by debiann, make sure that you start thinking about items used daily to move to counter height. I hung all my front opening zip up clothing items on low hooks (using over-the-door hooks on top dresser drawer) and placed a laundry bin of underwear and socks and pull-on pants on a low surface. In the shower, I used this drain belt for $22: https://www.tlcdirect.org/Post-Surgical-Drain-Belt... You can move the pouches around due to velcro attachment... You could wear it with anything... I also borrowed a shower seat from my father -- I was able to use hand-held shower attachment to clean my lower half :) That was really a good feeling. I really lived in my cami, though (slightly expensive, but I wore it every day, under loose fitting shirts and sweatshirts, always on its own to sleep) https://www.tlcdirect.org/Post-Surgery-Mastectomy-... I wore zip front sweatshirts with pockets a lot too... just safety pinned the drains (has hole at the top for this) to the top of the pockets. You would need to be in air conditioning for that. Others have used tool belts (can't beat the cost) similar to this: http://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-Canvas-W... Basically, you can pin the drains to many things -- JUST NOT YOUR PANTS. You may forget (fuzzy brain) and pull them down/out. That would create anxiety. I took only tylenol daytime and Gabapentin at night (already on that for migraines) after my BMX; so, I am not sure how pain meds affect your ability to handle the drains. Make sure that the hospital will have your daily meds (ones continuing from before surgery, like anxiety meds) because my hospital did not have my sleeping pill or migraine meds (even though pre-op they recorded them) -- I could not get tylenol for a headache and had severe reactions (migraines) to all the pain killers that they traditionally use... They will only let you have what is on your chart and only if it is in-house... Be clear that the hospital will have what you need (on hand in their pharmacy) to stay calm. My visiting nurse merely took my temperature and LOOKED at my drains to see if they were functioning. She was a waste of insurance $. I am sure that others have received different and better care? Any surgery is scary to contemplate. I just would like to reassure you that I went through 4 surgeries in a few days over a year of treatment, and they were all fine. I had my last surgery 4 months ago, and it is a distant memory. Make sure that your surgeons understand your anxiety and are prepared to deal with it. If you need assistance, ask friends. I have found my friends very eager to help -- they just need you to let them know what you need. Hopefully someone with diagnosed anxiety will respond soon -- will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",

At some point, I will want to have this revised. I am 100% certain that my original surgeon, whom I really respect, would have left me flat. It was just unfortunate that she broke her shoulder the week before my surgery. Is your surgeon willing to do this for you? I think that is key.",
