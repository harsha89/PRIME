      "Content": "Pats_Girl wrote: Hello.  I'm new here and very sorry if this topic has been discussed before.  My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer the week before Christmas.  She had ductal carcinoma in situ in her right breast and invasive ductal carcinoma in her left breast.  She subsequently went through a lumpectomy during which they removed the lymph nodes from her left side (quick biopsy showed cancer spread there).  Results from the lumpectomy showed that the cancer in her left breast spread beyond the borders of the tissue removed so she decided to have a double mastectomy.  She has been having a hard time with her left arm due to the lymph node removal and after the mastectomy she got an infection (something that started with a \"C\") on her left side at the drain side.  She was put on antibiotics which she finished.  She now has signs of infection (pus) at incision sites on her chest.  She's awaiting the results of the testing of the pus and is currently on antiobiotics (this occured Monday, 03.08.10).  She was supposed to start chemo next week and called to tell them she couldn't start it due to the infection.  They told her that it was okay, that she could/should still begin chemo.  I may be wrong but it seems that chemo would make it more difficult for the current infection to heal wouldn't it?  Should we listen to the chemo doctor or push for a second opinion on this?  Breast cancer has not/does not run in my family so we're scrambling to educate ourselves.  My mom has been having such a hard time with everything that has happened to her (care has not been that great from her provider) that I want to do everything I can to help with her concerns, frustration and questions.  If anyone can help me with this question I would be very grateful.
