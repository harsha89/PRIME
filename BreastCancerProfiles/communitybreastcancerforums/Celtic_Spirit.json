So, is it only when your blood pressure is taken above the elbow that lymphedema can occur or worsen? I'm at risk bilaterally, and I assumed it couldn't be taken anywhere on my arms. Except for twice a year on my arm (to get an accurate reading), I've asked all nurses and doctors to take my bp on my leg, which always produces way-high readings that freak out the nurses. Would a better and more accurate option be to have my bp taken on my wrist?

Although drinking alcohol appears to increase the risk of developing breast cancer, drinking may be beneficial for those who already have the disease, a new study of mice suggests. Of the mice in the study that had breast cancer, those that were given moderate to high levels of alcohol had fewer instances of cancer spreading to other parts of the body than alcohol-free mice did. . . . Mice who drank water spiked with a high dose of alcohol were 60 percent less likely to develop metastases in their lungs than those that drank plain water. Some protection against metastases was seen in mice in the moderate-dose group, but none was seen in the low-dose group.
