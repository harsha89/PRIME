Aussiechek...yes, my micromet didn't show up on the initial survey, but was there on the final pathology as well.  That's why I went back for more nodes, and they were all clear.  I would hate to be rushed to decision as you were.   I know that permanent side effects aren't certain, but I have seen them in my patients over the years, and I know that they are real.  Racy - I am reading as much as I can about the medications.   But I remain conflicted.  And thank you for the link.  Lyndal1966 - I don't think that there is a relationship with melanoma and BC, but I have a daughter who had melanoma 7 years ago.  Her SNB was negative, and she is doing well.  But I think that melanoma doesn't respond very well  to chemo, while BC more so.  And I am obtaining further opinions this week.  Greenfrog - yes, if I were to do chem, now is the time.  And pink is definitely not my color. Ketch - you make good points.  Again, I realize there may be some benefit to chemo, but I don't think that in my case it is very large.  Ma111 - good information, thank you.  And I am committed to tamoxifin either way.  Momof3boys - yes, without the oncotype I would be getting chemo for sure.  Also, even with the oncotype, had I not gone back for more lymph nodes I would be getting it for sure.  That is part of why I elected to have the second surgery for more nodes.  And they were all negative, giving me better numbers that way.  Ruthbru - I am committed to tamoxifin.  I don't know what side effects I will have, but I am committed.  And I have to do that either way.  Thefuzzylem - I trust my MO as well.  And he didn't encourage me to do chemo.  He said it is a very tough call, and that I'm on the border.   My family all look to my son, who is a radiation oncologist.  He is networking this week with some of his MO friends as well.  Claire-in-Seattle - Hi neighbor.  And thank you for your thoughts.  I read that about 24% of men stop tamox because of side effects.  It would have to be bad for me to stop.  I am as committed as I can be to that.  We do not have a good body of knowledge regarding oncotype in men.  Or chemotherapy for that matter.  There is little men specific information across the board.  And yes, I'm a runner.  Im signed up to run Boston in April.  That should be interesting, since I have been thrown off track big time with my running.  I have mostly cycled the past few weeks because of my surgeries.  I plan to stay very faithful with my exercise.  And no, I'm not a fast runner, I'm on the medical team for Boston.   Cookiegal - thank you for your input.  It all helps.",

I love my work, and my patients have been very very sympathetic and supportive of me.  I have just been picking and choosing who I tell, but that will end when the hair goes.    Again, I am grateful for each of your comments.   Any last minute comments before I cement my decision are welcomed.  ",
