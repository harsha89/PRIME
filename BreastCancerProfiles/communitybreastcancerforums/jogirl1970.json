I am waffling between - it's nothing, I am very large on top with dense fibrocystic breasts - and omg it's something, Sigh...not many people responded to me, and I am nervous wreck, so I thought I would drop you a note and let you know you are not alone. I hope it all goes well for you! Jo :-)",

I have since realized the films I took to her had that exact area spot compressed with no findings at all out of the ordinary. I know she doesnt know its there, because I took my films to her and she didnt look at them until I got there...literally... I have called mon, teus and twice today to let her know before I go in for the sono tomorrow....she has not returned my call and I am WAY beyond angry...I understand she is busy, but dont you think I should have gotten some sort of call back by now... I am going to in to get the sono and then go over to her office, ask for my records and get a new doc...because it looks like everything so far is ok...but what if its not? Is this the kind of care I will get? NOTHING...I am sorry...I am SO angry right now and I havent slept or eaten much in the past 2 weeks and am about ready to snap... Any advice? Am I being too harsh? I know she hasnt called because I have given her both numbers and no missed calls and no messages... Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

The BS called me this morning and said that the original spot I went to see her about is a lymph node. She said the dense tissue she is feeling is just that, dense tissue. She then proceeded to tell me that they  did see a 5mm cyst on the sono, but not on the mammo and she feels it is a benign cyst. I am to see her again in 3 months and have a repeat sono 3 months after that. She sounded like I was bothering her when I asked 2 questions...I am now looking for a new BS does anyone have any recommendations in the Baltimore, MD area? I am in tears...I cannot deal with this anymore (and its only been a month) I am considering having both breasts completely removed and having reconstruction as there is absolultely no way I can handle going through this every 6 months. I have now lost almost 10lbs and havent slept in days...I just cant take it...I would rather have them remove everything and be done with it, then worry constantly...what kind of life is that? I saw what my friend went through, at 37, surgery, chemo, rads and all that stuff...I had to give her her needle each time after chemo....it was awful for her... I am just beside myself...I want to talk to someone who wont brush off my concerns....any advice? Thanks for listening...I am going to go lay down... Log in to post a reply",

On the last mammo they detected what they think was a small lymph node...they did sono right there and couldnt detect it. Recommended 6 month follow up Next the report goes to my gyn who refers me to breast specialist...I go to see her and she says, yes thats a lymph node....let me do an exam...she finds an area that she feels is dense tissue in same breast...I know this area has been there forever and when I had the last mammo done they spot compressed the area (am sure it was the same area as when they called me back for more views, I asked...its the right one isnt it? and she said yes) so I new the area that was in question...and the did it and said \"ok, that rolled out just fine\"...I didnt ask what that meant...then the other view is the one with the lymph node... Back to BS appt...(Ha, that was funny, sorry) the doc did a sono on the area that she felt was denser tissue...she then said she did not believe i have cancer (I asked her flat out)....she then said to get dressed and come into her office...I did.... She told me is \"99+% that what I am feeling is dense breast tissue, you have no fat in that area and the tissue is dense (she pointed to mammo on board) I just want to cross my t's and dot my i's\"....so I am now going to see the sonogram person at the same womens center and I said how about if I go locally, I live in PA but have all my gyn care in Baltimore...she then said...\"no, I want you to have it done here...the sono is only as good as the person doing it and I trust them here\"... She also said since my breasts were very tender and my period is due soon, that may have caused the tissue to be more pronounced...I also had an injury in november 2005 that could have caused scar tissue...I dont know... Ok...so guess I am asking...this wil be my third sono (both showed nothing) one doc explained the tissue lies in a plain going in one direction they look for things going against that plain and would see a solid mass... Is it really possible to feel dense tissue but not see it? Could four years of identical mammo's have missed something? Would 2 and soon to be 3 sono's missed a mass? I have no other issues at all and am quite large...could this be adding to it? I have been told ever since I can remember that I have fibrocystic breasts... Anyhoo....thank you so much for any help...I am about out of my skin waiting for appt...btw...BS said I could wait \"3 -4 weeks, whenever you want to come back for sono and I want you to come back and see me in 3 months make sure its 7-10 days after your period\"... I thanked her and left, completely forgot to tell her about the trauma injury...will call her tomorrow and let them know... Thank you for any help... Jogirl Log in to post a reply",
