I will be meeting with my RO for a suggested course of treatment. I had 2 positive nodes but no evidence after surgery of anything in the nodes in my CT scan. I don't know if this means anything. I am concerned about the effect rads will have on me years from now. This is the beginning of my journey with rads research and treatment.",

Her reasoning was that when using those types of hormones for a longer period your body thinks it doesn't have to produce its own and it basically you become more and more reliant on whatever you are taking.

It explains why they wait until later in the chemo cycle before you meet with your RO. I have to admit though, I am gnashing at the bit to meet with the RO so I know what my summer will be like. I still don't know if I will do rads. They are saying I have to but I will have to be convinced. I haven't found anyone who has had a mastectomy and node involvement who hasn't done rads. I hate weighing the risks with the SEs.",
