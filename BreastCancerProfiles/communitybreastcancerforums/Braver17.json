You will need to discuss the further treatment plan with your medical oncologist. All words from the surgeon is just a guess based on his/her experience. MO may order Oncotype or not based on his/her evaluation on your pathaology report. With tumor size larger than 2cm, one of my friends had chemo done prior to her surgery. 2 If lumpectomy fails then is there any chance to skip radiation after mastectomy . - Your chest area could be given only one radiation treatment in your whole life. And radiation can make chest bone frangile, higher broken risk. - I was 47 and chose to have bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction last July with two tumors on left side, 0.8cm and 1cm. No radiation after surgery. And no chemo with Oncotype scores 14 and 16. - With my past year experience, almost all doctors are only carefully providing treatment options, but not actively helping on patient to make decision. Strongly suggest to do research on this forum. There are many first hand, very very useful information from our BC sisters! I learned from them on everything and then made my own decision.  ",
