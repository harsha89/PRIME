Talk about doing everything twice. Well, I totally freaked when I woke up and to find a drain pump put in me. At first doc said no, but she stated that she had to go deeper to get to the tumor. It is hard to keep my mind off of things until I get the results of this with something hanging off me. Doc took out 4 nodes, 2 felt fine but 2 were palpable. Ok what does palpable mean??? Does that mean cancer went into the nodes???? I am just confused and worried because of course the doc state don't put the horse in front of the cart... but with my hormone receptors being positive and HER2 negative if I have positive lymph nodes, does that automatically mean chemo???? I am so confused because the doc is telling me how they are changing the staging from about 2 years ago.. if stated if positive nodes and new staging I will still be stage I/II and she will need to do more surgery to remove more lymph nodes. maybe and insight that might help me understand all this would be great.",

I am not going to worry, well, try not to worry myself about the outcome of the PET because it is what it is and if they find something they can treat it. She told me and my sisters that they are coming out with new treatments all the time. I do feel better not so freaked out and I can't believe how fast they moved on getting everything scheduled. PET next week then follow up next Friday... Of course, my first thought was OMG they think something is bad and what to get me in and my sister told me no it is how thing should have been done in the first place and the doc wants to get me into treatment as soon as possible. So, once the scan test comes back, she will give me a treatment plan.. starting with chemo first then taking a look at the nodes. She said doing it this way will take out what is needed. Asked about the cold cap and she said it might work 30%, hey, I am willing to try it and will be going wig shopping. Feel so go with making my choice to go to this place. What a difference from going to a hospital setting to this..",

I already talked to her last night saying I don't want to know the pathology. Because now I am finding out that once surgery is done, I will have very little interaction with surgeon. I do feel at this point. I am willing to stick with her and her team at this point. But I am still getting second/third opinions. From what you said and someone else I talked to, I am better off talking to radiation & medical oncologist because that is their specialties and they will be the ones mapping out my plan. Again, still freaking out about the results. Because I don't believe what the surgeron initial stated.",

As for my staging, a little confused on that, but I am working as quickly as i can for second opinons to get the right treatment. Of course, I am trying to not think the worse. but with this group and talking to other, this is not a death sentence. just need to get the right team and treatment. I will not get any surgeries until all my second opinions come back saying I need it. then consider who will I go with. I heard great things about Sloan and if that is the right fit for me, that is where I will go. I believe I am moving as fast as I can, noticed something wrong beginning of nov 18 and lumpectomy was last week.",

I am still confused about my sentinel nodes were positive which were removed, the chances of having axillary nodes removed, and if I have more positive nodes does it automatically mean it spread through my body. If she can give me a little piece of mind and guidance for my upcoming appointment with an oncologist that will be helpful. and maybe something to help me sleep, but not Xanax, that did not agree with me at all huge side effects.",

As for treatment, no question in my mind I want the lumpectomy to remove as soon as possible it then radiation and be done with it..  I don't want to wait and second opinions will only delay treatment.  if it was up to me, I would have had the surgery already.. last week, but not enough time, I could have had it this week, but doc say, why not wait until after xmas 2 weeks will not make a difference.... so we agreed on 12/28/18",

If I need a copy I will get it but I don't want to see or hear anything but what my treatment plan is and get this done with. The surgeon told me that most women ask ok when will I be cancer free, she told me that right after the lumpectomy that it is all gone, come to find out that might not be true. I just have to learn not to take to heart what the surgeon tells me. Again finding out surgeon does the surgery the rest work on the treatment plan.
