I was having a terrible day, feeling yucky and drained, then went to the bathroom, had a BM and felt dizzy...remember thinking I should just try to get myself together and get the pants pulled up before anything happened. Then thought I was feeling a little better, but as I walked out the door of the bathroom, things went fuzzy and I woke up on the floor. Who knows how much later, but I remember laying there thinking....gee my head hurts but the rest of me feels soooo much better!  After a bit I picked up my glasses...which were twisted all out of shape and crawled to the bedroom and waited till someone came home. I'd hit the corner of a dresser and a doorknob on my way down so had a cut over my eye and a black eye....scrapes on my bald head and neck. I looked like I'd gone three rounds in the ring! My Dad got the phone so I could call the DR when he came in and then....sort of giggled and said I was beginning to look like Uncle Fester on the Adams Family. LOL! He was totally right. Good thing I'm not too vain. Anyway the Dr said it was the combination of the chemo, my blood pressure meds and the BM. Who knew your blood pressure  can drop like crazy when you are feeling bad and have a BM? They dropped my BP meds to a half dose till they switched me to Herceptin and I didn'f have any more trouble with passing out. Hope it's something simple like that for you! Lezlie",
