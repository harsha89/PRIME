Tuesday, March 15 is the unilateral mastectomy and immediate DIEP Flap reconstruction.  Today has been really really hard and I have been crying a good portion of the day.  I had done pretty well to date, but really just broke down.  I am scared, and sad.  As I am a social worker/therapist for a living for the past 12 years, I have basically been really good at managing my own emotions.  I am also very independent, and I think people around me just aren't sure what to do or how to help.  My family and friends are so used to me taking care of them, that it's difficult to see me like this.  It's difficult for me to feel like this as well.    Shocking is an understatement for what I felt, and am feeling.  This is supposed to be the happiest time of my life.  I am getting married this August, and have been planning my Disney Fairy Tale Wedding for months.  I was completely blindsided.  Now I just want the surgery over with.  The plastic surgeon has asked about wanting to have children, and I was planning on it, but now I am not so sure.  The DIEP Flap is a pretty long recovery.  I will have to check the other Boards to see how people recovered.    I am doing my best on hanging in there... but nights are the worst, and I can't seem to get out of my own head!",

I am 39 years old, felt a lump, asked dr to get a mammogram in Feb 2011.  Had the mammo, then a sono, no lump.  Radiologist tells me that there's no lump, but he did see some microcalcifiations that he wanted to \"take a closer look at\".  So on Feb 11, 2011, had the stereotactic core needle biopsy.  Titanium marker put it.  On Feb 15, 2011 received the preliminary diagnosis of DCIS.  Had an MRI done Thu Mar 3 at NYU and results show that left breast is clear, but right breast area is >11cm.  I am not sure what that means exactly, but it sounds really bad.  I am still awaiting results from BRCA genetic testing, so unsure what I am going to do.  If I am positive, then I would do bilateral mastectomy with implants, but if I am not, then I would rather the unilateral mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction.   My breast surgeon is Dr. Kathie Ann Joseph and she recommended Dr. Jamie Levine for the reconstruction.  Anyone have any thoughts, feedback, etc re: either of these drs, or has anyone worked with them, and what the results were like. My surgery is currently scheduled for March 15.  How long is the recovery from the DIEP Flap, I keep reading that it's 6 weeks, but what can I expect to feel the day after the surgery, two days after the surgery, etc... how long do the drains stay in?  Do they hurt?  Will I be in considerable pain?  Will I be able to walk, lets say I have to go to the bathroom?  Sorry to ask so many questions, I am just worried.

I have Grade 3 (high grade) cancer cell growth, and it's almost 12cm so they also believe it may be invasive, despite the DCIS diagnosis.  I got the BRCA results back today and it's negative, so I would prefer to use my own tissue and skin.   So, this week I have the MRA, and pre-surgical testing and bloodwoork.   I am trying to stay calm and positive, but this has been my most difficult challenge of my life.  ",
