    "Content": "Nov 2, 2012 07:48AM - edited Nov 2, 2012 07:49AM by bushturkey Thanks so much for this information.  Just stumbled on it today - a critical stage as I am just ending my 5th of 6 weeks of radiation - great explanation to understand what is happening - I have been dreading adding to the \"burn\" but now realise what will be will be, as they say!!!!   I had a very early (L) DCIS (discovered on routine Mammogram), lumpectomy in early September and require only the radiation (but after reading through a few articles in this website,  I will just double check on the hormone story!).  I was searching for info on aloe vera, (I was recommended to use the natural gel by a friend who is a homeopath) and I am extremely glad I have followed that advice after reading this article and the comments.  Interested to see someone's comment re sun exposure as I have exactly that, my boobs have never been \"out there\" and although very red, the worst of the soreness is in the chest area - I look like someone stuck an iron on it!!!  This was explained to me by the dr and the nurses at the oncology centre.  Thanks again for this article and all the posts - it does help to confirm you are not the only one!!!!  Cheers and all the best to everyone xxx",
