However, after my last haircut, which was really short, but a very good cut, seemed to help.  Then I found Nioxin in my beauty supply store, and started using Rogain on my crown. This may have also helped, when I thought it was too late!!!  Yesterday I looked in the mirror, and WOW, I've got some hair.  This is the 3rd. month of Rogain use, and about one month of Nioxin.  Plus, I have gone longer in-between haircut, instead on every 6 weeks, I waited 11 weeks.  I think the real key is a really good haircut, but all the rest of it including Biotin, are helping me feel better, anyway. The other day a co-worker, who is a really beautiful girl, came up to me and ruffled my hair, and said \"Hey look at all that hair!!\" Feeling good is looking good, in any book. ",

      "Content": "Jan 15, 2011 06:43PM - edited Jan 15, 2011 08:29PM by LeggyJ Hi all, I have'nt been on in awhile, but I thought I'd pop in again.  I'm a 11a IDC, but had a second lumpectomy and they had to take out 5.9cm to get a clear margin and had only a speck in 1/2 nodes.  Due to the speck, which they think got knocked loose, during core-needle biopsy, I had to do 6 rounds of TAC.  Now after all this time two months ago,  I pushed them into seeing a neurologist, I was found to have polyneuropathy in my feet and hands.  Really bad on the left side, and then I had a severe reaction to Neurotin, for neuropathy, and they diagnosed me as having \"ringworm\".  When I got home I was freaking out, my dog didn't have ringworm, my 80yr old mother, who lives with me didn't either, so I called my vet. who told me it was highly unlikely a 9yr, old miniature schuazer, who lives indoors, would have ringworm....only kittens get ringworm. After calling my GP again, I got an appointment with a dermatologist who called it, acute drug reation.  This was after I had been on disability from work for 5 months, due to illness.  It was like going through chemo. all over again. Now I'm walking with a cane, and have terrible pain, and there's nothing except opiates that can take the edge off. The trouble is it's on the bottoms of my feet, and no acupuncture, or ointments will work.  I knew there were possible side-effects, but now I've had to resign from my job of ten years, and look at a different kind of future.  One thing I know is you have to be your own best advocate, because the Onc. didn't believe me, and really no one did, I had to prove it, by being persistent.  Thank God, I had long term disability insurance at work, which they offered before I got BC in 08.  But at 54 yrs. old and having worked  since I was a kid, beginning at the ripe old age of 10, for my parents in a small business, and working my way through college, I'll be on Social Security Disability.  I loved my job, but it was physical, and now I can't even sit for long periods of time.  If there's a lesson out of this it's that doctor's don't know everything, and here in CA the health care system has run amok.",

I didn't want more nodes out, since I was very active, and have a physical job, so my surgeon had me see my future Onc. and talk to him.  He said it really didn't matter since having more nodes removed, wouldn't change my treatment. I had to do 8 rounds of TAC, followed by 5 weeks of rads., no matter what.  So, I opted to not have more nodes removed, and live with my decision.  We will always wonder if they got it all, or if that one cell got away. It's the fear factor, and what you can live with.  I'm on Tamoxifen, now, and had the CYP2D6 test, a few months ago.  I'm an intermediate metabolizer. Last week, I had my 2nd 6month appt. with my Onc. since finishing treatment.  I have really bad aches and pains, all over.  So he ordered a bone scan.  By the time, I got back to my truck, they called me, and made an appt. for the next working day.  I had the test Monday.  Received an email from my Onc. that day, saying Happy Holidays, it's not cancer.  Just arthritis from my shoulders to my feet.  I must have lit up like a Christmas tree.  He never said what to do about the pain, so I guess I just continue to take ibuprofen.  But it's not cancer!!!",

But I got through it!!!  Believe me, I was really nervous, and have a low tolerance for pain, but my hospital has a new digital machine, and it wasn't that bad.  Eight long days later, I got a card in the mail, saying NED. Today, I see my oncologist, so I can complain about all my aches and pains...Good Luck, to all of you, if I can do it you can.",
