I do not know if that is the same for everyone or if it depends upon the size of the lump they are removing and the location of the incision. Wishing you good results!!",

My report actually states \"no cysts\" when the month prior I had a biopsy on 2 cysts that have clips in them! I thought MRI's were better than this. Mine also says I have \"regional enhancement\" in addtion to \"inumerable small enhancing foci\". Birads 2. What threw me was the statement that there are no cysts and lack of any acknowledgement of the fibroadenoma....",

      "Content": "2GIRLSII wrote: I have been searching but can't find the answer to this. I had an MRI with benign results but am wondering what this means. It says \"inumerable enhancing foci\". What is that? It also says that there were no cysts shown. Seems odd to me as shortly before the MRI had a needle biopsy of a couple of cysts, so we know they were there. I also have a fibroadenoma and it makes not mention of that whatsoever. Is that unusual? Â Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
