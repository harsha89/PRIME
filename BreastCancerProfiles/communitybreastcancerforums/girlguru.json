Is it normal to have significant pain in both breasts for around 2 weeks of each month? The pain resolves with my period but I don't get why the pain starts so early for me. I've been tracking my period for months now. The pain seems to start around 2 week after my period and doesn't stop until I get my next period. Is my pain starting at ovulation? My LMP was March 2.. and the pain started around March 13th or 14th and will intensify until I get my period. Just curious. I've heard of menstrual breast pain but 2 weeks is a long time to be in pain. I can't do certain things like run or jump or do anything much more than walk for activity. I'm frequently in pain when I just move a certain way. Strong water pressure hitting my boobs will make me cry out. My breast doc doesn't seem concerned because of the apparent \"hormonal\" connection but.. geez. This is painful. I'm going on vacation in May and I'm terrified that I'll be in pain during that. thank you so much Log in to post a reply",

I hoped this day wouldn't come but my period came very early so that pretty much guarantees that I will have this debilitating pain during my one and only vacation. I'm dreading it as I'm going to a theme park and the thrashing around will make it hurt so much more than it already does. Is there anything I can do to make the pain go away? I spend so much time planning my vacation around the cycle itself that I simply can't plan it around my pre-menstural symptoms. I'm sorry if this sounds petty in comparison but it truly is about an 8 on the pain scale. Are there any remedies for this?",

It seems more severe than it should be but it's on both sides. So I guess there must be a hormone component going on. Do you know if cyclical breast pain/lumpiness increases BC risk  ? i HOPE YOur tests go well :) thank you for the support and advice. ",

      "Content": "girlguru wrote: hey everyone, I am high risk for breast cancer and recently had a followup with my doctor. she was talking to me about getting an MRI done for a baseline. she went on to examine my breasts and told me that my left one is lumpy. more so than the other. she didn;t really say much else. What do I make of this? would she have said if i needed to worry? She went back to talking about the MRI. Would she have had me to an ultrasound if there was a specific lump in question? she was already talking about the mri before checking my breasts. Now i'm feeling paranoid that she found something bad and just assumed I would get the MRI. I'm not sure I'm ready for an MRI. I'm scared and confusd. I know women can have naturally lumpy breast tissue. Can you have lumpy breasts from a fibrocystic condition even when you are not on your cycle? i'm 26. can you have fibrocystic breasts at 26? sorry for the panic. Log in to post a reply",

She didn't say much about my lumpy breast but I can imagine it's not normal  or else she wouldn't have mentioned it. I know fibrocystic change causes lumps but... I thought that was only during your period. I finished mine a week ago. plus I thought fibrocystic change mostly affected women over 30. i apprecaite you all.",

It doesn't sound like she wants me to do that but she's at least discussing it with me as a possibility. I'm pretty sure most insurance companies will cover this procedure for high risk women. In your case, you should qualify since your mother had this disease. It's a big decision and it sounds like you've given it some thought. It does seem like surgery is a small price to pay to ease your mind about breast cancer... but not if insurance won't cover it. Find a new doctor if this one won't help you. Breast specialists are preferrable to general doctors on this issue. Good luck and I'm sorry your request is being ignored! ",
