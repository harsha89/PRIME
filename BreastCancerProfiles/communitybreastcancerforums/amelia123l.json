My winter workout has been a three mile walk or snow shoe on an Audubon trail near my house which is lovely, I am looking forward to warmer weather and pulling out my bike to mix things up a bit. I have my appointment tomorrow to meet with a radiologist about the chemoembolization procedure ....I am interested in learning more and hoping it may be a good option for me . Being new to this thread and other threads as wellI just wanted to say thanks for the warm welcomes ! ",

I am continuing to try and walk my three miles a day, managed to make it out 5 days last week and hope as the weather gets better here I will get out more . This weeks 5 day challenge which I was on suddenly disappeared on my phone? Any ideas on how to get back on? If not I will try to join up again next week! Thanks and enjoy the day! And keep on moving!",
