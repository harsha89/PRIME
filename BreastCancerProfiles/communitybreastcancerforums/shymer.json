In fact, if he leaves Clarian, I still plan on using him as my breast specialist.  He told me that if he does leave he will be in with Dr. Chase Lotich who is a very good Dr.  I have seen  her also early on.  So if you decide on Dr. Goulet, I do not think you will be disappointed.  He is very compassionate.  He takes his time with each patient and answers any questions or concerns you may have.  He also answers in terms that any lay person would understand.  Everyone here at Morgan Hospital and the Regional Cancer Center is sincerely hoping that he does not leave.  We have such a difficult time it seems keeping Drs that are so good.  We have good Drs, but Dr. Goulet is exceptional.  We are so fortunate to have the Regional Cancer Center and Dr. Dugan - he is amazing!   I still feel so fortunate that I have the information that I do.  My team of Drs watch me so closely.  Dr. Dugan just took me off femara for the time being. It was causing me to be very emotional and moody and we have some family situations that have been very stressful and the femara was increasing my stress.  Dr Dugan said there was no reason to prescribe an antidepressant to counter a medication that I really did not HAVE to be on.  It is a preventive and with the information they have on me, if anything did occur it would be handled quickly and a cure rate would be very high also.  I will see him again in 3 months and go from there.  But that is my experience with Dr. Goulet.  God Bless You!  Let me know your experience and progress.",

He did this for me because my husband had just lost his job due to the stores he worked for were being sold and our insurance was about to run out.  It was a blind study so I didn't know what I was taking for about 3 years.  I have been followed closely  by my oncologist and will be for the rest of my life because of the STAR study.  I have diagnostic mammograms once a year and visits with my breast specialist, Dr. Goulet and interviews with the Cancer Center.  I haven't done an MRI but I wonder now with the new diagnosis of ADH if it will ordered at some point.  I have had 4 biopsies, one being stereotactic and the other 3 excisional.  I saw Dr. Dugan yesterday and he has prescribed Femara.  I will see him in one month with labs and if everything is on track, 3 months and then every 6 months for 5 years.  What I have been frustrated with is that there just is not much information about either of these issues.  My Drs have been really good with any questions I have, but sometimes I am just not sure what to ask.  He did tell me yesterday that it is rather rare for a woman to have both.  he said my risk is probably 1 in 8 and with the Femara it will decrease by 50%, which is 1 in 16.  Thank you, Anne for responding.  It is good to hear from someone with the same issues!  And I do know who holds the future!",
