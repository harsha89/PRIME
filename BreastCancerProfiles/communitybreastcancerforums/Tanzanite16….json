It's progressed now to the point where I am experiencing extreme pain. It wraps like a band across my torso - a searing, aching, heavy pain. It radiates from the tips of my nipples, all the way through to my chest shoulders, around the sides under my arms and into my back. It's the worst in the middle between my shoulder blades and between my breasts. It's really uncomfortable and painful and I'm grateful that winter is coming because then I can cuddle my hotwater bottle with relish. Painkillers don't help me. The Pyridoxine that I'm on doesn't make the cysts any less nor does it help with the pain.",

It kind of gives the ol' self-confidence a knock when you're supposed to still sport pretty breasts (that aren't supposed to head towards your stomach yet) and you don't. I try to hide my boobs from my fiance, there's nothing pretty about them at all anymore. Some days I feel like having the breasts removed... then I remember I don't have a medical aid and that I'm probably just being really impulsive.",
