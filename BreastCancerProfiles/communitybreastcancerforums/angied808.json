I don't know - but it was worth it.  It will be ok! en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracen... ",

It is pretty quick, they drained 1.5L from my lung in less than 10 minutes.  I'd say it would be good to have someone to take you home but you will be fine.  I was good to walk around and everything afterwards. It will go well and be over in a jiff Paula!",

I've been on Xeloda and Tykerb for 9 months, chemo for about 14 months total.  Tumor markers dropping. The past 2 months the lymphedema in my left arm has gotten worse, and despite treatment by my PT, I have stabbing constant pain in my axilla and arm bones in BOTH arms.  However I had a scan in November that came out NED.  My Christmas gift from cancer was finding a swollen node in my neck. I am really worried something is spreading - has anyone ever experienced anything like this?  The pain really stinks.
