      "Content": "Apr 3, 2014 10:46AM - edited Apr 3, 2014 12:13PM by clickety_clack well now I just got the news of my mom's follow-up that happened today. The hospital wants to start a round of chemotherapy. in fact because it's a government hospital, they started today with no warning. There will be +- 7 more sessions over the next few months. The hospital said it's a precautionary method. I'm furious. I believe that any remaining healing could be achieved naturally through diet. Am I crazy? edit: my parents are very confused. I don't live near them. now they say it's stage 3 cancer. I will try to get the full story and start a new thread.",

After the chemo I last wrote about, she went for another surgery to \"remove whatever was remaining.\" The government hospital doesn't communicate clearly with my parents, who are elderly and can barely take everything in anyway. After recovery, she was sent for 10+ sessions of radiation on consecutive days. (Dec 2014 / Jan 2015) She had onset of osteoarthritis before the cancer diagnosis, but it's become much worse. She was taking Arimidex. She was in so much pain and is now on morphine. She is walking with a cane. She went for a checkup, and now they say the cancer has spread to her bones, lungs, and liver. They want to do more radiation.  I am extremely angry. All this treatment has taken away her remaining health. She should have taken the surgery and then gone natural. It's criminal that they could prescribe such treatment for an elderly person who does not have the same immune system as a younger one.  Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine said, \"First, do no harm.\" Modern medicine is failing our family. ",

It's a government hospital, so maybe that's why it's so long. When I said blood tests, I meant 'fine needle aspiration' sorry about the confusion. The doctor said it was cancer and that chemo may be needed... I guess we shouldn't panic until we get further results, but that will only be in 6 weeks, and it feels so long. Thanks ziggypop and Hydavis42",

Conclusion thus far: Inverted lump in breast that looked like a belly button turned out to be stage 1 cancer. Feeling relieved :) Love and light x",
