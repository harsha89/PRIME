I was diagnosed almost 7 years ago. My case was textbook; I found the lump in the shower while performing my monthly breast exam. Fast forward 7 years, a double mastectomy and reconstruction after chemo and radiation, plus twice in remission. Last week my doctor said it was time to start looking at clinical trials and hospice care. For that reason alone I'm freaking out over here because I just don't feel that sick. My major complaint right now would be these recurring pleural effusions. It seems every few months I have to have a thorasentisis. My doctor said some people have them done weekly. I'm sorry for rambling here, it's just that I'm nervous about the uncertainty and now I feel a lot of pressure on the right side of my back near the injection site. No pain, just pressure like someone is standing on my back. In the past, I always have chest pain immediately following the thoracentisis and gurgling sounds for a day or so but never back issues. I'm concerned that another pleural effusion is starting again already. Anyone out there experiencing my symptoms? Log in to post a reply",
