    "Content": "mtnchick wrote: I'm post right mastectomy and gearing up for radiation.  I have read that there is reduced heart/lung rads exposure in the prone position, however the research seems to be with women who have had lumpectomies as opposed to mastectomies.  Makes sense as the breast tissue hangs down and the radiation is farther from the organs.  Does anyone know if this is also the case for mastectomies?  I'm getting chest wall, internal lymph node, axillary, and supraclavicular rads.  Thanks!   Log in to post a reply",
