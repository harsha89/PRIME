(please don't think I'm wierd...I really did)  Anyone else have this experience?  Also, although they told me NOT to use any burn creams etc, I really want to put some vit e oil on my skin over the weekend.  Someone told me that she did that and just cleaned it off well before going back.  Any input?  Here, they have just changed to the new protocol of 4 weeks instead of 7 (following the Canadian design).  I was scheduled for 7 weeks.  I had to stop all hormone treatment (serious side effects)  and they didn't feel I could tolerate chemo...so it's just surgery and rads (I have all sorts of nasty physical complications preventing chemo).  Any thoughts on the studies that show 4 weeks is sufficent?  Well...Happy to meet you all.  My heart is with you each!",

I had my MRI today and in a nut-shell my neurosurgeon messed up.  The ommaya reservoir was inserted THROUGH the ventricle of my brain.  Dr Kelly *the good Doc* said that the end of the tube from the reservoir is irriting the cranial nerves so that I can't see  ,,,,which means that I was right to feel like the neurosurgeon and his partner were blowing smoke from the very beginning.... Which ALSO means if they would have done a scan 2 days after my surgery instead of insisting that there couldn't be anything wrong with their port I would not have spent the past 2 weeks puking, not being able to see and suffering from bad headaches......Grrrrrrrr OK, so now Dr Kelley is talking to all the docs to see what is next.  I can't get metholtrexate through the Ommaya since it is not putting the drug in the right place.  I can't bet my Avastin because it causes bleeding and I will need more surgery, and once we get his damn port out, I will still have to get a new one!!!! I am so mad about all this I am spitting nails.  Please pass the word....I just don't have the energy to type more......",

I have never participated in any sort of discussion board before.  I am really thankful for the encouragement that I receive here.  Thank you all. ",
