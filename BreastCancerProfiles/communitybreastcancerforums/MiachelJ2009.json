Two passed in their 60's, one I don't know the reason, the other from ovarian cancer. I just found out about this family history after I was told about my suspicious mammogram.  I am BRAC 1 & 2 negative. I am scheduled for my bilateral mastectomy, L sentinel node biopsy & Lat Flap reconstruction February 12th.  I got on another site & began reading that a lot of ladies got DIEP.  My PS doesn't recommend that surgery for me....said I didn't have enough belly to work with.  So, Lat Flap, here I come!!!  So.....if you've had this surgery, please let me know how you feel about it.  I'm a little nervous about the post op & the final results.  I was going to get a 2nd opinion for the DIEP but I'd have to have that surgery at another hospital at a later date & I really can't afford to be off work for a 2nd round of hospital & recovery time!!!  So, I'm sort of at peace with my Lat Flap decision, LOL!  If I can hear some good things, I'll really be at peace.....so tell it to me ladies Thanks!!!!!!!    Mia DX 12/17/09 ~ 44 years old.
