My pathology after surgery was ER+ 8% and PR and Her-.  My MO called yesterday with results of Onco type test.  High intermediate range of 30.  MO said my pathology changed though.  I am now ER-, PR +.  Said she would be recommending chemo and we will discuss at my appointment that I have coming up on Tuesday.  I've been researching some of the older posts with similar stats and have seen people state that chemo should start within 8-12 weeks after surgery (I am coming up on that quickly).  Still not sure what I'm going to do, have to wait to go over report. Any thoughts, comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
