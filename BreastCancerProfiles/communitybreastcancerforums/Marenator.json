    "Content": "Marenator wrote: Hi, I'm hoping someone here can answer some questions for me. I had an ultrasound done on my left breast last week after finding a small hard lump. I just got the results, and while I feel relieved, I still have some worries. The radiologist report said it was a probable simple cyst located left retroareolar region at 4:00 o'clock. 3x2x2 mm hypoechoic nodule. Benign lymphnodes in left axilla. However he also wrote that the size and position of the nodule made it difficult to confirm this and he recommended a mammogram (I'm waiting for my appointment) as well as a follow up ultrasound in 3 months. This is good right? Am I worrying for nothing? I just expected that if it was a cyst I wouldn't need any further testing for it. Log in to post a reply",
