Misty, I agree with LJ13 that you should eat the foods you like -- I had heard it was risky to eat favorite foods during chemo, but I did anyway, and have no aversions or unpleasant associations to them now, six months later. During treatment I lost a lot of weight and I think it's because I had no interest in the chocolate and sweets that I routinely ate before chemo. Once I started enjoying them again, the weight came back on very quickly!",

      "Content": "Roadrunner wrote: I'm halfway thru chemo and recently saw an ENT for chronic sinus problems that pre-date the chemo. I have to have another surgery after chemo and need to get things cleared up before then. The ENT, a senior person, approached me with an instrument to examine the inside of my nose without washing his hands, and I asked if he would please wash them. He said, \"Of course, Ill be glad to\", then did so, turning the water off with his bare hand and drying with a paper towel. He then took out his phone to check a message, and when I said, \"Oops. Now you need to wash them again,\" he said, \"What do you mean?\" I said that the phone had contaminated his hands, and I apologized, saying that my immunities were very low and I thought that mucus membranes were particularly vulnerable to infection. I asked if they had any alcohol hand rub and he said, \"We don't use that.\" He washed his hands and put on gloves and it wasn't an issue after that, except it was clear he thought I was crazy. The following week I saw another specialist about chronic cough   related to the sinus thing, and he thought it was okay to use the alcohol foam on the wall outside the examining room door and then use his hand to open the door, check his phone and then examine me without feeling he had contaminated his hands. (He knew that I was at the point in my chemo cycle when I was most vulnerable to infection). He washed up at my request, just to make me happy, then turned off the faucets with his hands. I asked why they didn't place the hand rub on the wall inside the examining room, and he said, \"Oh, lots of things carry germs, my ball point pen, for example. Even healthy people carry germs all the time.\" Both of these offices are next-door to a major tertiary hospital, the hospital I'm about to have surgery in, in a large city. Am I crazy? I wouldn't complain if I was being seen for a swollen ankle, but when my face in involved, I feel like I'm really at risk. Does anyone know of a document that cites proper hand washing procedures, including what constitutes post-washing contamination? I did find that the World Health Organization advocates turning off the water with a paper towel when one is available, something I've been doing in public bathrooms myself for years. Happily, I've never had any hand washing problems with any of my bc surgeons or oncologists, but they get very uncomfortable when I bring up having had a problem with another physician, so unfortunately are not a resource. Would appreciate any resources!!!! Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Sometimes I would throw in a banana. The hospital nutritionist told me to always to include some kind of carb when I ate protein, or the protein would get used exclusively to provide energy. Smoothies provide both. Good luck.",

This time, I explained that I had a post-mastectomy implant to the TSA person BEFORE I raised my arms for the machine, but it made no difference -- I still had to submit to pat-down of both breasts. Between the two incidents over the last two weeks, I filed a complaint with the TSA about being consistently pulled for secondary screening because of my implant, and got a form-letter reply saying that they have to do this, that terrorists can disguise themselves as disabled people or try to conceal something in their clothing, so they cannot exclude any particular group from secondary screening. I hope that everyone reading this board knows that you always have the right to ask for the screening to be done in a private place (not all the airports have signs telling you that, as it requires two attendants and slows up the line) and that, at the very least, you should have a female attendant. If you are travelling with someone, have them keep an eye on your belongings, as they will be sitting unattended on the belt while you are being patted-down. And wear socks, as you will probably be asked to walk without your shoes further than just thru the machine. The first time this happened to me I was extremely upset by it, and although I am less and less freaked out each time, I still believe it to be a violation of my rights and I am not among those who feel it's a small inconvenience to keep the public flying safe.",

I had hoped that between last May and this month that TSA would have made some attempt to educate screeners and determine what surgical implants look like on the screen, but it appears that things have gotten worse, not better.",
