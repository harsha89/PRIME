She tried many ointments and creams like dermazin, lignocaine, betnovate ... and they all didn't help treat the burn, just relieving the pain. Does anyone know what can help her because when the doctors see it they don't suggest any useful treatment? Sometimes it really hurts her to the extent that she cannot sleep comfortably (because on of them is under her arm, so the pain is felt around the burn - causing pain in the back close to the burn). Please help. Thank you.",
