I would have removed them the first time. My lesion was 0.6mm. But aggressive. No nodes. I would have not had Rads the first time. I guess that is three regrets. And then for the forth . When my breast Ca recurred the second time I would have kept them. It's awful either way. And very much like the weather . But just make sure you do not rush into anything. Get your second and third opinions . Good luck !!! Read survivor stories best way combat free. I'm still one step ahead . Pets negative. No nodes off to have rads again. This time second and third opinions from the top 5. MAKE sure get your report. Do not let insurance dictate your future. Contact American Cancer institute know your rights.

Received 2yrs of thought to be piece of mind.(always get imaging) Scout about I have a question. What treatments have you had. I like the way your onc is changing it up. I often wonder if meds we have used in the past can be used for future treatments. Or basically trying to trick cancer by switching meds say Ibrance stopped working so bring it back later after a other treatment fails. I dont know grasping at straws . I guess. Im not sure if I should worry about receiving only one med and no iv chemo . I really haven't responded well to treatments thus far. Im not sure if I should ask for the strongest now or wait? Hard decision to make. Thanks for listening:(",

My only discouragement is if its in my liver now is it just a matter of time before it moves to other spots or does anyone think if you knock some spots out this a cure. Im sorry Im confusing myself. It goes back to when I asked my Docs to remove the one and only lymph node that had cancer, before I ended up with liver mets but said it didnt matter because it was already in my blood but of course > They gave me rads for the local skin mets and cured it. Anyway I appreciate the knowledge that is shared . I am so happy for this forum otherwise I would be a panicky basketcase.",
