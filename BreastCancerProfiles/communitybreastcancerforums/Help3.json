I started wearing a sleeve and then started swelling in my hand. It will never go away and is waaaaaay worse with a sleeve even if I wear my glove/guantlet either alone or both. After experimenting I quit wearing my sleeve and my hand is still swollen(size 8 ring finger instead of 4.5 as it used to be) but with the sleeve it is so much worse. I have the swelling in my arm but it stays stable. I am seeing a lymphedema specialist at johns hopkins in august to look into lymph venous bypass.",
