      "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 12:22PM - edited Jun 4, 2008 12:24PM by Westie HKitty, I drove as soon as my drains were out (7 days later). Keryl, a drain is a clear plastic tube sewn in 6 inches or so  beside the incision (under your upper arm, on your body).  The tube is anout 30 inches long with a plastic bulb(about the size of a grenade) at the end which collects fluid which would otherwise have to be absorbed by the body.  The bulb has to be emptied a few times a day at first, then less and less until the drain may be removed.  It doesn't hurt (trust me) and helps you heal faster.  I had a home care nurse once a day to check mine and remove them when it was time.",

I wish you were here, we could have a nice cup of tea and discuss. Also, don't be shy about asking your Dr. for anti-anxiety medication.  It calms you down and helps you sleep. You will do it all, one thing at a time.  Keep us posted.",
