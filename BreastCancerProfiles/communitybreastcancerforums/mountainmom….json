It seems there was something there that they wanted to biopsy by needle. I elected for the lumpectomy and the result was atypical lobular hyperplasia (which I just posted to find out more about). Try not to worry and good luck. My lumpectomy followed my diagnosis by about 2 weeks so they were pretty quick.",
