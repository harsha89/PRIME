      "Content": "MLSMLS wrote: I never thought I would be entering information in a forum but here I am. Like you, I have received what many perceive to be the most devastating news healthwise one could ever anticipate. I went on 11/24/09 for what I thought would be a normal appointment for a mammogram. I even told my job I would be in by 1:30 p.m. On October 5, 2009, I had my OB-GYN appointment for a pap smear. This was the exam of which I was dreading the results. About 6 years ago, I had a left oophorectomy and a hysterectomy. I still have my right ovary, cervix, and fallopian tubes. It turned out that the pap smear was considered normal although there was fluid around my right ovary. I have had a 2nd vaginal ultrasound to monitor the fluid on the right ovary. I had also been experiencing pains throughout my body especially in my hip joint areas. Sometime the pain was so intense that I could barely stand and support myself. I say all of this to explain why the breast exam with my breast specialist caught me completely off guard. I called myself doing self exams. My doctor discovered a lump in my left breast axillary area. She made the statement you have a lump and that you might have a touch of sarcoidosis. Some of my family members have a history of sarcoidosis (auto-immune condition) and my younger brother had lymphoma. Since sarcoidosis is not considered cancerous, I immediately determined in my mind that if I had a choice, I would rather the diagnosis be sarcoidosis than cancer. It was a case of the lesser of the 2 evils. I had my left breast operated on for a sebaceous cyst in March 2008. In 2008, I had 2 mammograms (March and April). I never had an MRI done and did not realize until now that it might have been a good idea for one to have been done since the MRI does a better job of producing very detailed information about the breasts. I do not know if one had been done at that time if it would have shown the cancer in my left breast or not and led to earlier treatment but it definitely keeps me wondering. Although I am not a doctor, I would definitely encourage anyone who has had or has a sebaceous cyst to push for your doctor to follow up with an MRI. The cancer diagnosis has spanned from 11/24/09 until a 2nd appointment with my oncologist on 12/30/09. I was originally told by my breast specialist that she had requested that my oncologist start chemo on 12/30/09. However, when I met with the oncologist, she said they never do a consultation and chemo on the same day. I am scheduled to start on 1/6/10. I normally am a very detailed oriented and inquisitive person, but I have been a more reserved in getting detailed answered about the stage and prognosis of my cancer. Mentally and emotionally  I have been in such a low state that I do not know if I can handle more news now especially since my test results and appointments have been so spread out and I have so many emotional roller coasters. Initially, I was told by the oncologist nurse that the result of the biopsy on the lymph node that was done in the office on 11/24/09 showed normal cells but no lymph node material. This prompted her to check with the radiologists to make sure that the sample was taken from the right area. The pathologist used the other samples the radiologist had gotten to do a flow cholometry and it was determined the lymph node was malignant. I was told it showed metastic carcinoma. Because of the type of cancer, I was told that it had to have a place from which it originated, an MRI of the breasts showed a suspicious spot in the lower left area of my left breast. An additional biopsy was done on the left breast under MRI and it was determined that the cancer in both areas is the same. I have had a total of 3 biopsies (2 on the lymph node and one on the left breast). I was told that the tumor in the lymph node is 2.5 cm and the one in the breast is 3.3 cm. I was told the breast tumor is more linear than wide and that at the end it kind of bubbles out.  I did not ask the stage, again, because I do not know how many more things I can mentally deal with although based on the information I have read I think I know. If I remember correctly, the oncologist said the tumor showed some estrogen uptake on the inside cells but the outside cells showed they are protein driven. She has opted to use Taxotere & Carboplatin and Herceptin for treatment.   I know I am just kind of rambling. You can imagine the virtual rollercoaster I am on. I am a 55 year old single parent with 3 grown children (youngest 22 is still with me and attends college) and 4 grand children. I have burned both ends of the candle all of my life. I work and am in a delimma about what to do about work, pay, and benefits. I was struggling with full pay before the diagnosis. I have signed up for short term disability and the job provides long term disability but of course the pay would be less than my full pay. I have no retirement benefits so I cannot retire early and the only health insurance I have is through my job. In addition, through all of this medical drama, my insurance company changed on 1/1/10. My oncologist said it is against the law for the insurance company to say I have a pre-condition and not cover me but I worry that insurance companies can find a way to work around any protective laws with healthcare regulations in their current status.  I do not know what to do. I am scheduled to return to work on 1/4/10 and my chemo starts on 1/6/10. Some of the side effects that I have been reading about with the chemo make me wonder if I will be able to carry out my work duties. I do not have the kind of job that can be done from home. I work at a college and have high interaction with students and parents. As a matter of fact, I am the only person that handles the unique requirements of my job. There are so many things I want to communicate about. One of my daughters told me she found your site and encouraged me to look into it. I have to limit my typing because I am having major problems with my arms, shoulders, and right and left hands. This concerns me as well because I have read that some of the side effects of the treatment I will receive sometimes cause swelling and muscle pains. I do have a sister-in-law who is a stage 4 survivor but she told me her cancer was a different kind from mine. I do want to encourage everyone to be your strongest medical advocate for yourself. I pushed for many years and with various doctors for some of my medical conditions to be investigated further and they were brushed off because of results from some other test or exam or doctor personal preference or doctor's fear of upsetting the insurance company. In researching metastic carcinoma, I was surprised to find out recently that as far back as 1977, there was thought to be some pre-cursor connection between cutaneous (skin) conditions and metastic carnicoma. I bring this up because for about 10 or 11 years, I had an ongoing flare up initially on my left thumb and then other left fingers. Eventually, it moved to my right hand. I had dermatologists tell me it was just a dermatitis but the smell, drainage, and nerve pain was unrelenting. It would flare up about every 3 weeks continuously. I noticed over the last maybe 7-8 months it had not been flaring up. After stumbling up on the study, I wondered if whatever it was just moved internally maybe even impacting my left breast and lymph node.  I want to write more because it seems therapeutic but my arms and hands won't let me write anymore.

It causes you to be hypersensitive. I read one poster that described herself as normally a rock and now she is a pebble. That is my predicament to a great extent. I always had the strength and answers for everything. However, lately, I have been reduced to a basket case. I am constantly trying to reassure myself that treatments will not be for nothing. I want so much to live a productive life. It just feels good to know that someone heard and saw my plea. Thank you again for responding and for the suggestions.",

Sometimes you don't realize how much you are needed, loved, and cared for until you have to deal with a major illness. I have a great support system from my religion, my children, sister, brothers, insurmountable number of friends, students and parents, and strangers. For that I am very thankful. Hopefully, the crying will start to wane. I would hate to give Niagara Falls a run for its money :-). When I think about it, I have gotten a lot of positive news. It's just that sometimes when you are feeling depressed and in the poor me mode, it is hard to recognize it.",
