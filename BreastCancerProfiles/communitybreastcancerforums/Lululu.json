I have met a few people who also got dry mouth, dry tongue, and very sore mouth from breast cancer radiation, so this is PROOF IT CAN HAPPEN to the mouth, even if it\u2019s not supposed to affect the mouth, it does and cancer teams need to help their patients and do some more research. My cancer team didn\u2019t even look at my mouth. If there are more patients out there I am praying you will share/post your situation on this site for the cancer drs. to see!! My last treatment was mid nov 2018, and I am still having a lot of mouth problems today, which I have to nurse most days and I am praying will go away. Thank yo",

My mouth is just awful, not sure what to think or what to do. My tongue is so dry and is sticking to the roof of my mouth at night. It feels like wet wood chips in my throat and fizzy drinks feel like battery acid in my mouth and going down my throat cuz it burns so bad. Radiologist said that breast cancer radiation is targeted to breast, so it could never affect my mouth, didn\u2019t even want to look at my mouth and sent me to my primary dr! I had a bad cold my first week of radiation and took cold meds. I did end up with a very bad rash on my breast that none of the 5 creams they gave me would help, they made the rash worse. The rash finally just went away, but I have no relief to my mouth and throat and have dr appts. I am very upset because I don\u2019t know what happened to my mouth, and was wondering if this happened to anyone else and their outcome. I\u2019d appreciate anyone who\u2019d like to share. Thx!!!",
