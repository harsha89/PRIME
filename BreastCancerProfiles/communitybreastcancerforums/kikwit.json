      "Content": "kikwit wrote: I am writing on behalf of my friend, who lives in Ukraine. She is 42 years old. Was diagnosed with IDC, ER+/PR+ HER2+. Surgery: Lymph node removal, Mastectomy Left, Right Chemotherapy 4 sessions, Radiation Therapy 14 sessions. After the second session of radiation therapy she had no period for six months. And she got her period back this April. Now her doctor says that she needs oophorectomy. She has a child and she doesn't want to have children any more. But she is afraid of side effects of this surgery. She asked me to learn how does it work in US and Canada. She also hesitates because the surgery was scheduled and then postponed twice. It's like if it doesn't come to you maybe you don't need it. So could you please explain if this surgery is really needed in my friend's situation. Log in to post a reply",
