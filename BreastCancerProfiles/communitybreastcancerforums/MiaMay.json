      "Content": "MiaMay wrote: Hi! I posted here once before about my nipple changing direction.  I'll give some background.  I'm 34. Around a month and a half ago I noticed my nipple had changed shape drastically. A part of it is pulled in and it has given it the appearance of changing directions. I went to my GP who ordered a diagnostic mammogram. The diagnostic Mammogram showed an \"irregular density\" and a spot mammogram was ordered. The spot mammogram showed focal asymmetry and an summation artifact. (I think the words were something like that.) They put me in Bi-Rads category 3.  Now I have a \"dimple\" or more like a caved in area that is parallel to the nipple and to the area where it is also pulled in. I called my doctor and explained this and now I go in for an ultrasound tomorrow for another look. The indent is fairly decent in size. It is long and my finger fits in it. It is like someone laid their finger on my breast and pushed in and then after taking it off it stayed.  I'm trying to remain calm but my mind has been in dark places ever since the drastic change of my nipple. The diagnostic mammogram nor the spot mammogram could give me a definitive that it was benign and now I have even more symptoms that align with breast cancer.  I'm just looking for some encouragement. I know all you ladies were once in the waiting phase and I am just trying to focus on my job, my son and to not cry everytime I think about it.  Cancer runs in my family. All my grandparents died from it. Several of my aunts and uncles have either died from it or have fought it and my aunt had a double mastectomy when she was a few years younger than me. The symptoms are alarming and it seems surprising how fast it is progressing. I took photos when I first noticed the nipple and I went back and in truth the dimple was already there but was much less prominent. It's only been a month and a half and how much more prominent it has become has scared me.  My sonogram is tomorrow. I have some questions. All the tests have been through the hospital my GP is located at and one of their many radiologists read it. I have not been referred to anyone who specializes in breast cancer. I looked into the radiologist and cancer is his specialty. Not breast specifically but cancer in general. Should I ask to be sent to a breast cancer center? I live in rural Kansas and honestly don't even know if we have one. Should I go to my OBGYN and have him also made aware of the changes and give an assessment?  I hope to hear from some of you for some encouragement. I know many of you went through this and it was followed by the news you had cancer. I know that my chances are good that is not the case but I'm scared all the same. None of the tests thus far have been able to calm my fears and rather just leaves me further in the dark. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.  Log in to post a reply",

I think I am going to have everything sent to my OBGYN just because he is my lady doctor and I think this is information he should have. I\"m due for this years pap anyways. It takes weeks and an hour drive to get into him so I scheduled with my local GP when I found the changes in my breast. I have just kept with the same doctor as I go through the multiple tests.  I appreciate you taking the time to respond to me. I see you've been diagnosed twice. You are very strong to have gone through so much. All the best to you. ",

It shows Fibro glandular changes and cysts in the area of abnormality on the mammograms. I\u2019m still in a birad category 3. I made an appointment with my OB as o feel the nipple changes and indent has been mostly overlooked. I had to push for the sonogram to be done over the indent and he paid very little attention to it. I want answers to why my nipple looks like a c now and why I have such a prominent indent. But I\u2019m happy with the results. I\u2019m being my best advocate because if I don\u2019t, who will? Breasts don\u2019t cave in for no reason. Could be lazy ligaments but they need to tell me something. Thanks for checking in",

I just wanted to say I hope that your biopsy turns out negative and all is well. Please do keep us updated as to how things go. The waiting and not knowing is very scary and it is hard not to panic. I hope that in these next few days that you can find something that brings you peace.  I have an ultrasound tomorrow after having had a diagnostic mammogram and a spot mammogram. No call for a biopsy yet but I can imagine that is scary as I am very scared.  Sending you prayers and hopes that all is okay. ",
