Still wondering whether to bother with a stuffy bra or not. My other boob is not large and fairly saggy as I'm 55, so if I wear baggy clothes it isn't obvious. Maybe in the summer when I start wearing t-shirts and lighter clothes I will revisit the bra options. I do ride horses, so will probably need at least a sports bra for that But so far I have had zero issues or feelings of awkwardness from walking around braless.",

I have had very little pain but a LOT of itching. The nurse replaced my bandage when she removed the drain, but now I have noticed some of the steri-strips are sticking out under the bandage and they are not adhering. I have not had a proper shower yet, and hoped to have one this morning but I am afraid if I do everything will fall off and I don't know if the incision is fully healed yet. I have some steri-strips here, so am wondering whether to go ahead and then replace them after I shower, or see the doctor before I shower? Log in to post a reply",

It will be a week tomorrow- things look mostly healed, I ended up having a shower with the hand-held nozzle and avoiding the area just to be sure. I took the big bandage off and cleaned around it with one of those sponges you use before surgery. Glad to get the bandage off- it was getting very itchy",
