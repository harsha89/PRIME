    "Content": "Threefilets2014 wrote: my husband and daughters have tried to commit me to a mental institution or nursing home rather than assist me. They feel that I should keep going like before and not feel tired, hungry, nauseous or need their help at all. I have tried to contact elder abuse for assistance but no one gets back to me. My oldest daughter is thirty three and her sister is twenty five. They are certainly old enough to understand my situation but don't visit or even help me with a meal occasionally. My husband has a history of domestic violence that he was able to bribe and get out of including getting the U.S embassy to give him a ten year visa after he was prohibited entry for several years after his last episode of violence when our youngest was a minor. I cannot seem to get protection in my own country. I am too ill to proceed with divorce and hope there is some agency that can monitor the behavior of these people who are hindering my chance for recovery. Log in to post a reply",
