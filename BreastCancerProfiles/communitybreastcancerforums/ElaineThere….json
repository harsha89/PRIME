I know; it sounds kind-of crude compared to the MRIs and PET scans out there. My oncologist even used a ruler to measure my lump as it shrank during neoadjuvant chemo. Well, the cancer may be in a lymph node; one of mine tested positive before chemo. But, as long as your cancer hasn't advanced beyond the axillary nodes, it will be considered early stage and has a very good prognosis. I suspect that your cancer may be either triple negative or HER2+. If you are going to do chemo before surgery, definitely ask the MO about chemo regimens and what you can expect. If you're getting a hard core chemo like AC or Taxotere, ask about whether you will be receiving Neulasta the day after to help sustain your immune system. Most chemos lead to hair loss. I asked my MO for a prescription for a cranial prosthesis (a wig) so my insurance would help pay for part of the cost. Some women try to save their hair through cold caps. If you're interested in that, you might want to ask the MO whether or not she is OK with that. (Some are not.) Good luck!",

I recently received a letter from my insurance company in which the company said that my oncologist would no longer be considered in-network because she had resigned from Mercy Oncology. Long story, but what actually happened is that she is joining a new oncology group, and that group is applying to my insurance for a contract to be considered in-network. So, I may not lose her after all. You may want to do a little investigation into your oncologist's whereabouts. I will say, though, that it is shocking that she would resign without notifying her patients! My OB/GYN is going back to his home state, and he notified us in February (office just closed this Friday). He sent us a form so that we could have our records transferred to our new doctors, once we had found them. Although I have only been seeing my oncologist for three years, it would have been very hard for me to switch to a new one. She had been there for me during the worst period of my life, and she knows things about me that I just don't tell anyone. I'm very sorry that this is happening to you.",

Most breast cancer patients in the US get either AC (Adriamycin/Cytoxin, sometimes followed by Taxol) or TC (Taxotere/Carboplaitin). A smaller number of women get FEC (5 Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide). I was diagnosed with HER2+ cancer, and HER2+ patients typically get some kind of taxane (Taxotere, Taxol) that they combine with targeted therapies like Herceptin and Perjeta. I ended up doing AC + Taxol/Herceptin/Perjeta. The different combos have different side effects and some patients might tolerate one combo better than another. For example, AC can be tough on the heart, so if you have heart problems, maybe TC or FEC is for you. My oncologist monitored my heart very carefully while I was on AC through heart scans (MUGA). TC often causes gastrointestinal distress, but most breast cancer patients make it through this regimen. I got mild diarrhea on Taxol, and often wonder if it would have been worse if I'd had the Taxotere regimen. RE: hormonal therapy, that typically starts after chemo. You'll have some time to talk with MO about the AI vs. Tamoxifen decision. Hope this helps!",

In contrast, your Mum's cancer did not respond well to the Letrozole, so giving more Letrozole after surgery would not have been considered the best option after surgery. Remember that both hormonal therapy and chemo are systemic treatments. Hormonal therapy starves cancer cells of the estrogen that feeds them; chemo kills cancer cells that travel through the bloodstream and the lymph system. Both are designed to prevent cancer cells from setting up shop in the bones or in major organs (lungs, liver, kidneys, etc.) and producing an incurable form of breast cancer (metastatic or Stage IV cancer). In contrast, surgery and radiation are local treatments; they involve removing invasive cancer where it has already been detected.

I was Grade 3, and chemo got rid of the active cancer in my breast and nodes. As for where your Mum fits in \"chemo world\" now, her doctors may consider her akin to a triple negative patient. Yes, triple negative has a reputation for being aggressive, but any cancer that is Grade 3 is pretty aggressive. The good news is that women with triple negative breast cancer often have good outcomes. It is the case that triple negative patients have a relatively high rate of recurrence after the first 2-3 years of diagnosis. However, that rate of recurrence decreases rapidly thereafter.",

I currently have no evidence of disease (NED), and live a full and active life. The full extent of my cancer was more apparent after the MRI scan, but some have found that mammograms and ultrasounds were more accurate. I guess it varies by BC patient.

However, many women with early stage triple negative cancer are successfully treated and do not experience recurrence or distant metastases. In your case, because you're grade 3, chemo should work well because chemo works best on fast-growing cells. Also, the chances of recurring after diagnosis decrease significantly for triple negative breast cancer patients after 3 years or so. ((Hugs)) All cancer sucks.",

During Taxol, only bland, salty, or sweet foods tasted good to me. Even now, a cookie, chicken nuggets, or French fries taste good to me, but healthier stuff like salads do not. (For salads, the main culprit seems to be the dressings -- I can't east ranch, Italian, vinaigrette or other dressings -- I guess I could eat them naked.) Because sweet tastes good, I've taken to eating lots of fresh fruit or vegetables like corn and carrots that have a sweet side to them. I also drink a lot of diet hot chocolate and \"Just 15\" fruit punch. (Got really sick of water during AC.) Tea -- which I used to drink by the gallons -- seems to exacerbate the diarrhea, so I stay away from that. Good luck! Hope your taste buds recover faster than mine.",

RE: MRI -- The MRI may give your medical team a more accurate idea of what is going on with you. For example, my ultrasound revealed a 3.9 cm tumor, but the MRI was more accurate and showed that it was 5 cm +. One node also lit up, and that node then tested positive through a fine needle biopsy. A breast MRI involves lying on your chest and having your boobs dangle down. There are lots of loud noises, and some people feel claustrophobic. If you don't like staying still in a confined place, you can request a sedative. I've had three MRIs, and they don't bother me. I got my genetic testing done before I chose my operation. However, I was already doing chemo when the test results came in because my cancer was HER2+. Since I tested negative for genetic issues, I did indeed get a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. Getting the cancer out of there isn't as big a deal as you think. Yes, get it out, but more importantly, see whether or not you will be getting systemic treatment (hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, or chemo therapy). Cancer in the breast itself is not a killer. Cancer that makes a new home somewhere else in your body could very well be what kills you. If you are ER+, you can get hormonal therapy. If you are HER2+, you can get targeted therapy (Herceptin & Perjeta). If you are Grade 3 or your Oncotype score is high, chemo therapy may be recommended. Good luck!",

Taxol is better than no chemo, but remember: estrogen is feeding your Mom's cancer. An estrogen sucking drug (ESD) like an AI (I'm on aromasin) can be very powerful medication in and of itself.

The Oncotype test is only for hormone positive/HER2- cancer, so no, your MO wouldn't order that. Since the invasive portion of your cancer is small (less than 1 cm.), the standard treatment is Taxol + Herceptin, which is gentler than the treatments for HER2+ cancer that is larger than 1 cm. (As you can see from my signature, I ended up getting AC + THP.) Some women have been able to get Herceptin alone, but typically the initial infusions of Herceptin are given with a taxane (either Taxol or its harsher cousin Taxotere). Alas, yes, Taxol does lead to hair loss, but at least it's not associated with a very very small chance of permanent hair loss like Taxotere. You could ask your MO about Herceptin alone, and you could seek second opinions from others. But, MO is just suggesting the standard treatment; there's nothing all that unusual about her recommendation.",

They are expensive scans, and are often deemed unnecessary by health insurance. Even though I was diagnosed at Stage 3 with an aggressive kind of cancer (triple positive, Grade 3), my insurance company balked at paying for my MRI (though it was later OK with my PET scan). In many instances, it is the case that patients at Stages 1 and 2 are highly unlikely to have mets. For example, if you have a small tumor, no nodal involvement, and your cancer is growing slowly (Grade 1), the patient is very unlikely to have mets. In your case, your ki-67 is high and you have nodal involvement. Scans seem more appropriate for you than for many at your clinical stage.",

We often think of it spreading through the lymph system, but it can also spread through the bloodstream. After all, for a cancer lesion to survive, it needs a blood supply. So, yes, even if you're Stage 1 and have clear nodes, there's always a very small chance that your cancer could spread that way. Also, remember that for mets or local recurrence, stage may not be as important as grade or what kind of cancer you have (HER2+? Triple positive? Triple negative? Hormone positive? Hormone negative?). Some cancers are just more aggressive than others, regardless of size and nodal involvement. I think the formulation in question is that mastectomy is no better than lumpectomy + radiation at preventing mets. However, it should be noted that mastectomy is slightly better than lumpectomy + radiation at preventing local recurrence (another cancer in the breast area) because there's less breast tissue left afterwards. But, even if you have a mastectomy, that's no guarantee that you won't have a local recurrence. Best wishes!",

No, I don't think a chest X-Ray will give you better information; if you're interested in a full-body scan to see whether or not the cancer is localized (in the breast area) or has metastasized, a PET scan would do the trick.

They may be able to tell you how quickly it is growing (grade). They may even tell you if your cancer was being fed by hormones (ER+/PR+).

Your biopsy report should show whether or not your cancer is estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PR) positive. Your HER2 status may take a little while longer to determine. Hopefully, your BS candidates should have access to that report. There are two kinds of oncologists: medical oncologists (MOs -- oversee chemo, hormonal, and like treatments) and radiation oncologists (ROs -- oversee radiation). I met my MO shortly after meeting with my BS because I did my chemo before my surgery (neoadjuvant chemo). I only met with my RO after my surgery when we began to plan my radiation treatment. If you do surgery first, you may not meet your MO until after surgery. Whether or not you receive chemo depends on a number of factors, such as your HER2 status, the grade of your cancer (how fast it is reproducing), the size of your lump, whether or not any lymph nodes are involved, etc. If you are HER2 negative but positive for ER/PR, you may request an oncotype test to determine whether or not your cancer will benefit from chemo. Since your cancer has lobular features, there may be chemo or radiation in the future. But, I'm not your doctor and not an expert about ILC. No one takes the loss of their hair lightly. Some ladies fight to save their hair during chemo (see threads on cold caps.) But, hair loss is usually only due to chemo. If you don't get chemo, no worries.

Reconstructed breasts can be aesthetically appealing, but they lack the sensation of the real thing. At age 46, I was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer (triple positive, grade 3), and I opted for a lumpectomy. I figure, if I have a local recurrence, I can always get a mastectomy. In the meantime, I'm happy that I didn't have to undergo reconstruction (which often requires multiple surgeries and can have complications), and that my breasts are still there, in all their middle-aged glory.

Some women find the side-effects of hormonal therapy difficult, but the good news there is that there are different variants of hormonal therapy, and you can try to find the one you best tolerate. Three years ago, I was diagnosed with triple positive, Grade 3 cancer that was over 5 cm. and had invaded one node.

I had Taxotere's supposedly gentler cousin, Taxol, and it did give me diarrhea two days after my infusion. But, I could manage it with Imodium, so that was OK. (I also learned the locations of lots of grocery store restrooms!) You will definitely lose your hair with Taxotere (and a very very small number lose their hair permanently while on Taxotere). It's best to have your head-covering/wig plan in place before you start. I bought a wig before chemo, and shaved my head after my second infusion. Will you be taking steroids like Decadron before chemo? If so it might help if you get a sleep aid or Melatonin or something. Steroids can definitely interfere with sleep! Are you ER+/PR+ as well? If so, you are triple positive. There's a very welcoming and supportive group of ladies on the Triple Positive Board, some of whom have had TCHP. ((Hugs)) It get's better....",

My boob has a scar but it otherwise looks pretty normal and has retained sensation. As far as how starting chemo before your wedding will go..... Your doctor is right that if you have your first chemo infusion before your wedding, your hair will probably still be there. But there's no guarantee that you'll feel like partying at your wedding. I did four infusions of AC, and 12 infusions of Taxol, and I worked through them. But, I was lucky and didn't have many side effects. Still, even though my side effects were mild, I wasn't exactly bursting with energy. I would get my infusions on Wednesday, be OK and on a steroid high through Friday, and then the side effects would hit on Saturday. For AC, my worst side effects were fatigue and spaciness. For Taxol, it was fatigue and mild diarrhea, which I managed with Immodium. In any case, there's no guarantee that you will have a mild reaction to chemo. Plenty of strong women have found themselves hospitalized with infection, dehydration, and other problems because of chemo. The fact that you're young is an asset, but no one -- not even your doctor -- can predict how you'll respond to your treatment. Best wishes!

It takes awhile for breast cancer patients to learn the details of their diagnosis, so your GP has probably told you all that she knows. IDC is the most common form of breast cancer; about 80% of breast cancer patients have IDC. Breast cancer is very treatable, and there's no need to panic. This is not the time to be fixated on worst case scenarios, so staying off of Dr. Google is a good idea. Some of the data out there is old and no longer accurate. Most of us live years and years after our diagnosis. Even breast cancer patients who've been diagnosed at an incurable stage (Stage IV) increasingly live several years after diagnosis. I was diagnosed at Stage III with an aggressive form of breast cancer, and I'm coming up on my five year Cancerversity. Stay hopeful and stay busy. When you know more about your cancer, this is an awesome place to discuss and debate treatment options and the like. ((Hugs))",

I began treatment with my oncologist before surgery, but that was primarily due to 1) the fact that my tumor was large (5 cm. +); 2) my tumor was HER2+ (it's easiest to get a targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer [Perjeta] before surgery); and 3) my tumor was aggressive (Grade 3), and I was going to get chemo anyways. For someone who is Stage 1 and doesn't show any nodal involvement (yet), meeting with the oncologist is not a must for now. But, you might want to meet some possible oncologists now so that you find one you're comfortable with. Because you are ER+/PR+, it is likely that your oncologist will recommend that you do hormonal therapy after surgery. For many, hormonal therapy lasts 5 years; for others (like me) 10 years is recommended. If you do end up doing hormonal therapy, you will be visiting your oncologist for 5 years, and it helps to be with someone who is sympathetic and listens to your concerns. Good luck!",

Based on your stats, an oncologist would probably recommend 12 weeks of Taxol + Herceptin, either before or after surgery. Then, there's about a year of Herceptin. Depending on what surgery you choose, and whether or not any nodes are involved, your doctors might recommend radiation from 4 - 6 weeks. That's not to scare you; it's just to point out that triple positive breast cancer is a marathon and not a sprint. It's an aggressive form of cancer that is best treated with targeted therapy (Herceptin). Would you be willing to be far away from your husband and you high schooler for a long period of time? Or, would you be looking to spend some time with your extended family and then transfer some of that care back to your new hometown? I personally don't have any preference for major hospitals vs. community hospitals. My cancer was triple positive; my doctors adhered to the triple positive protocols. It wouldn't have mattered whether I went to the major cancer center in a city 30 minutes away or I stayed in town and got treatment here. I would have gotten the same deal. Good luck and ((hugs)).",

That test is only used for patients who are ER+/HER2-. I would suggest that you at least consider targeted therapy (Herceptin) if you choose not to do chemo. As for menopause, I do Zoladex once a month to achieve chemical menopause. That way, I can take an AI (Aromasin). If you want, you can take Tamoxifen instead of an AI without becoming menopausal.

If you attend the oncologist appointment with your Mom, it will help if you can share your Mom's general health issues with the oncologist. For example, does she have heart issues? If so, some chemos (like Adriamycin) would not be appropriate. How are her bones? Postmenopausal women are often prescribed aromatase inhibitors (AIs) if their cancer is being fed by hormones like estrogen. AIs help suck the estrogen out of our bodies, making it more difficult for hormone positive cancers to thrive. Unfortunately, AIs also lead to bone thinning. If your Mom already has bone issues, let her MO know. Also, ask if your Mom can get an oncotype test. That test can help determine whether or not your Mom will benefit from chemo.

However, I still did surgery and radiation. I'm especially glad that I did the surgery because the surgeon found a tiny pocket of DCIS (non-invasive cancer) that didn't show up on the scans. Scans are imperfect, and even if you think you've had a pathological complete response (PCR) to chemo, the only way to confirm that is surgery and the surgical pathology. I have, however, seen some women opt out of radiation if they had a PCR and a mastectomy. Like you, I was Stage III, Grade 3 when I was diagnosed, though I was triple positive and not triple negative. Given that my cancer was aggressive and locally advanced, my doctors would have recommended radiation regardless of whether I did the lumpectomy or the mastectomy so I did the lumpectomy. Best wishes!",

For example, you don't mention the grade of your cancer or whether or not your lymph nodes have been affected by cancer. If none of your nodes are affected, an oncotype test is a good idea. I'm not sure about how unusual it is for a BC patient to be 100%ER/PR positive. I know that I was 95%ER/PR positive, so that gives me extra incentive to do hormonal therapy (Aromasin). Many women do opt for mastectomies and double mastectomies for a variety of reasons. Some have cancer activity in both breasts; some have small breasts that wouldn't look that great after a lumpectomy; some women would like to avoid future mammograms, etc.. Personally, I chose a lumpectomy because I didn't want to do reconstruction, which often involves at least two surgeries. Lumpectomy + radiation produces similar survival rates to mastectomy, so there's no real advantage in that regard. Indeed, a mastectomy is no guarantee against 1) local recurrence or 2) distant recurrence (mets). Best wishes!  ",

Since I had no (visible) active cancer left, I was able to opt for a lumpectomy (the surgeon removed a golf-ball sized amount of tissue around my surgical marker). I always say that HER2+ cancer is a marathon, not a sprint. I was diagnosed in June 2014 and had my last Herceptin infusion in December 2015. I thought I would never complete treatment! As for feeling nauseous... If you do have bad side effects from chemo (and I didn't, really), be sure to tell your medical oncologist (MO). Our MOs want us to finish our treatments, and most of them will try to find ways to address the side effects so we don't quit. As for hair.... Your MO can give you a prescription for a \"cranial prosthesis\" also known as a wig. Health insurance will often pick up some of the costs!

But, then it didn't show up on the CT scan and the hip MRI, so MO decided it was a false positive. So, we did lots of scanning to discover....nothing! I had no pain in my hip, nada.

I didn't wait; shortly before Dose #2, I shaved my head. (I hate shedding hair and already had my wig.) During AC, the first two days after the infusion were OK because I was still on a steroid high from the pre-treatment meds. (It was hard to sleep on those days, however.) By Day #4, I was pretty spacey and lethargic. Small tasks like putting away the laundry took forever and seemed to sap my energy. But, by Day #6, I felt better. Otherwise, my worst side effects (SEs) were heartburn (managed by OTC meds) and altered taste-buds. Are you getting Neulasta shots after each AC infusion? Some BC patients have problems with Neulasta. Many take Claritin to avoid its SEs. I didn't have problems with Neulasta myself. IamNancy gave some good advice -- join the July chemo group when it forms. (Or, you could start the thread yourself!) I was in the July 2014 chemo group and it was a very supportive group of women.

As for spreading outside the breast, you might get a breast MRI or maybe a PET scan before deciding on your treatment plan. A breast MRI might show whether or not there's any activity in the lymph nodes. A PET scan might show not only nodal involvement but also whether the cancer cells have found a home elsewhere. The beauty of chemo is that it treats your entire system, not just your lump/breast area. It is supposed to kill the cancer cells that are floating around your body, trying to find a new home. In contrast, surgery and rads are localized treatments that just address your lump in the breast and that general area.

So, remember to take it one step at a time. If the results of your biopsy shows cancer, the initial pathology report will say what kind of cancer it is. But, it may not have the details yet. For example, it's important to know whether or not breast cancer is fed by estrogen and an overexpression of the protein HER2. But, that information may come later. Did the initial reports on your mammogram and/or ultrasound give you a Birad level? If you are Birad 4 or 5, you may have something to worry about. Otherwise, you may be a bit presumptuous in predicting cancer at this point. ((Hugs))",

I'm not saying this is your wife's case, but PET scans often produce false positives. I had \"something\" on my left hip show up on three PET scans, so my oncologist ordered an MRI with the intent of biopsying it. But, it didn't show up on the MRI or a CT, so she considers it to be a false positive. It IS interesting that the MRI, chest X-ray, and PET scan picked up different things. You'd hope for some consistency there. But the truth is that different scans see different things. Is it possible to biopsy any of the questionable spots? A biopsy is the best way to tell, for sure, if her cancer has spread elsewhere. That said, just because your wife's nodes exhibit no evidence of cancer, that doesn't mean she doesn't have mets. Cancer can be spread throughout the body by the bloodstream and/or lymph system. That's why chemo and hormonal therapy are often deemed necessary -- they travel throughout the body and help destroy cancer cells elsewhere before they find a new home. If your wife indeed has mets, that doesn't mean she is \"terminal,\" as in she has months to live. But, it does mean that she will always be doing some kind of treatment for the rest of her life, and that it is more likely that she will die from breast cancer rather than from some other cause. Many Stage IV breast cancer patients live active and fulfilling lives, as you can see from the participants in our Stage IV boards. There are all sorts of new treatment options for Stage IV patients, and some manage to stay disease-free for years without doing chemo or other harsh treatments. Again, ((Hugs)). It would help us if you told us more about your wife's cancer. Has her cancer been fed by hormones (ER+/PR+)? Does it have an overexpression of the protein HER2 (HER2+)? What Grade was it? In the meantime, do ask about whether it is possible to biopsy any of the trouble spots. Best wishes! ",

Chemo is systemic -- it is supposed to kill the cancer cells circulating in your body so that they cannot settle down and find a new home. Since your wife is HER2+, which is an aggressive form of breast cancer, chemo is typically recommended. Moreover, Herceptin -- a targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer -- is typically given with a taxane (either Taxotere or Taxol). As an HER2+ woman myself, I was happy to get Herceptin (and Perjeta). These treatments have helped thousands of HER2+ women avoid recurrence and mets. If your wife is having problems with Taxotere's side effects, she may want to talk to her oncologist about taking Taxol instead.

If you are premenopausal, and planning to take an aromatase inhibitor for hormonal therapy (only for ER+ women), some doctors will take out the ovaries because the other option is to do ovulation suppression. Ovulation suppression involves a periodic shot (mine is once a month) to shut down your ovaries. I actually chose to do ovulation suppression rather than an ooph. My OB/GYN would prefer not to do an ooph if there isn't anything wrong with the ovaries. He says that women tend to live longer if they keep their ovaries. Good luck!",

So, yes, your cancer is of an aggressive type and may have spread to your lymph nodes. But, that's not always the case. Right now, you have to be concerned about the cancer in your breast; unless it has metastasized it is probably a localized invasion. In the past, women who had HER2+ cancer had the worst outcomes. But, nowadays, thanks to targeted therapies like Herceptin and Perjeta, the outcomes of HER2+ cancer have improved. No, it doesn't matter whether you get a lumpectomy or a mastectomy in terms of outcomes. Despite having a 5 cm. tumor and one lymph node involved, I had a lumpectomy after neoadjuvant chemo. Because you are HER2+, however, you will probably get some chemo, maybe Taxol (with Herceptin) and then Herceptin for the rest of the year. I do know that Stage I HER2+ patients have less intensive chemo than those of us who were Stage III. Good luck, and feel free to post on the triple positive thread. It's full of very helpful women.",

For ER+ women, as Meow notes, hormonal therapy is an additional systemic treatment that is available. Of course, some women who are prescribed hormonal therapy don't care for its side effects and quit. Radiation is not systemic treatment; it is localized. Depending on your situation, your doctors might not recommend radiation because you are getting a mastectomy. However, mastectomy doesn't always rule out radiation. I got \"the works\" -- chemo, surgery, radiation, targeted therapy (due to HER2+) and hormonal therapy (Zoladex + Aromasin). My cancer was aggressive (Grade 3, HER2+), so I treated it aggressively. But many women have cancer which is far more indolent, and it might be over-treatment to undergo all possible treatments. That is what the Oncotype and Mammaprint tests seek to determine.

You say that your wife's cancer is Grade 2-3. That means it would probably respond better than cancer which is Grade 1. You also say that one node tested positive for cancer. My advice there would be to make sure that her doctors mark that node BEFORE neoadjuvant chemo. Maybe, they can insert a tumor marker (?). My surgeon didn't, and since the post-chemo MRI and PET scan indicated that my nodes were clear of active cancer, no one knew which node had been compromised prior to chemo. So my idiot surgeon ended up taking out ALL 20 of my Levels 1 and 2 lymph nodes. (Ugh. I am lucky that I didn't get lymphedema.) If my surgeon had inserted a tumor marker, he could have taken out ONLY the previously-compromised node and a few of its neighbors. Your wife should want to minimize the number of nodes removed. So, before she agrees to neoadjuvant chemo, she should make sure that her doctors have \"marked\" the compromised node.

In fact, I'll be getting Herceptin infusions, every three weeks, through September. Beginning about a year ago, I began what is called \"neoadjuvant chemo\" or chemo before surgery. Because my lump was big (5 cm.+!) we were hoping to shrink the tumor so I could have the option of a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy. I had four infusions of adriamycin and cytoxan, every two weeks (this is known as dense dose AC, in contrast to AC that is infused every three weeks). That is when my hair fell out and I began wearing a wig. AC made me spacey and lethargic. I had heartburn one week, but didn't have it for the rest of my treatment. Days 4 and 5 were the worst as far as fatigue went. After AC, I did twelve weeks of Taxol and Herceptin (a targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) every week. I also had four infusions of Perjeta (targeted therapy for HER2+ cancer) with that combo every three weeks. Taxol/Herceptin/(Perjeta) gave me mild diarrhea, starting Day #3. I managed that with OTC meds like Imodium. When I finished chemo, I had an MRI and a PET scan. They showed that chemo had destroyed all of the active cancer in my breast and compromised lymph node. In January 2015, I had my lumpectomy. My surgeon took out a golfball-sized amount of tissue from my right breast, and 20 lymph nodes from my armpit. Recovery was OK, though I did have to have a seroma (excess fluid) drained. In February 2015, I started hormonal therapy (Aromasin). It's a pill that you take once a day. My cancer was fed by estrogen, so Aromasin helps suck all of the estrogen out of my body. Normally, premenopausal women get Tamoxifen, but the recent SOFT study showed that premenopausal women who go into chemical menopause and who take an aromatase inhibitor (like Aromasin) have better outcomes. To achieve chemical menopause, I get a shot every month of Zoladex. So far, my side effects from Aromasin have involved mild hot flashes and moodiness. To deal with these side effects, I take Celexa (it's an SSRI) daily. In March 2015, I started radiation therapy. I did whole breast radiation and seven or eight boosts (radiation that is directed solely at your surgical scar). Radiation turned my breast red, like it had a sunburn. It felt tender. But, the burn faded in a few weeks. I was very lucky, as I have had few problems with any of my treatments. I worked through chemo and rads, though I reduced some of my workload. (I resigned from a few committees in my department at work -- I teach at a university.) I am also fortunate to be able to work at home on the days I don't teach. Hopefully, you won't have to get all the treatment I had. I was Stage IIIa when my cancer was detected. I feel very fortunate to be feeling good and to have excellent treatment options in my community.",

Indeed, what's driving your Mom's chemo treatment is the fact that she tested positive for an overexpression of the HER2 protein. Was your Mom's cancer Grade 3? That will also play a role in the decision to add more chemo. It is true that women who have Stage I HER2+ cancer often receive Taxol + Herceptin, and that's it. I was Stage IIIA, and I got Adriamycin + Cytoxin (X4) and then 12 Taxols + Herceptin and Perjeta. In your Mom's case, her new oncologist is suggesting FEC, which is similar to AC. So, she'd end up having a regimen like mine. By the way, my cancer WAS Grade 3 and very aggressive. I was glad to get a strong chemo regimen. Hope this helps!",

Once the MRI showed that I had at least one compromised node and that my tumor was 5 cm+ (and with a possible satellite), the center's team recommended neoadjuvant chemo to shrink the tumor before surgery. I was then handed over to my medical oncologist, who ordered a PET scan to rule out mets (cancer was Grade 3 and HER2+, very aggressive). A week later, I got my port, and then a heart scan (I did AC +THP; both Adriamycin and Herceptin can cause heart damage). Then, it was on to chemo. MRI's are supposed to be (somewhat) more accurate than ultrasounds for measuring the size of the tumor and for discovering compromised nodes. My ultrasound showed a 3.9 cm tumor; my MRI showed it bigger. Also, it was clearer from the MRI that the cancer had spread to at least one node. But, even MRIs can overestimate or underestimate the size of the tumor. Indeed, the only way to really know the size of the tumor is to operate and take it out. Since I had chemo before surgery, and chemo wiped out the active cancer in my breast and node, I will never know for sure the size of my cancer or how many other nodes (if any) were affected. It is unlikely that your surgeon would order a PET scan or a bone scan unless mets were a possibility. Best wishes!",

So, my surgeon took out all of my Levels 1 and 2 lymph nodes -- 20 in all. They were all clean. Fortunately, I did not get lymphedema, but I was kind-of annoyed. My RO says that with neoadjuvant chemo, treatment doesn't necessarily change because a few scans show the cancer gone. I was diagnosed at Stage IIIA, so I got Stage IIIA treatment. Sigh.",
