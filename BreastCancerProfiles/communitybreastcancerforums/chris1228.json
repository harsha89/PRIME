At age 54, after the tram (11 wks ago), I am enjoying a flat tummy even tho I am still so sore! It will get better. I guess we all have our not so good days. Hey, I'm alive!! ",

PT made the foob bigger in case of some tissue dying & needing to remove some of it (not happened thank goodness) It's still uncomfortable to wear a bra, I'm lopsided and only wear one to work (part time for now) i too have that \"tissue\" under my arm, how long will that take to go away? ugh. I have been single now for 15 yrs. I have 2 wonderful adult daughters and a great support from my mom & sis who live a few states away. My 1 daughter lives w/ me ( husband in Iraq) & has been my \"nurse\" (drains,bandages,catheter,meds) thru this whole thing & seen more of me than she probably ever wanted to. That was hard enough for me, I'm used to taking care of everyone. But to think of dating right now will take a lot of PRAYER for me  . I'm so glad to have you guys to talk to. Hannah I too had clothes that showed my figure off tastefully, even at 54. But now I cry when I try them on. It's got to get better!",
