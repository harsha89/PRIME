I was diagnosed on 12/29 w HER2+++ 6+cm tumor w multiple lymph node involvement and a tiny spot on my sternum. I started TCHP 1/17 after much stress (had to push twice due to infusion rm scheduling, insured declined my PET, then showed up for chemo and my HP hadn't been approved, etc etc). I'm doing cold caps too which made the day go faster I guess. I felt great after, just a bit tired. I've been doing 15min of HIIT cardio a day per my onc and I think it helped a ton. I wonder how much worse the next one will be",
