When I show her your advice ... I'll hear it directly. So far, I've covered the beneficiary changes for life insurance, disabiliity ,and all work- related benefits. Final paychecks, leave reimbursement, and retirement, etc. To be sure the money will be divided as I would want it to be. This gave not only myself, but my family , peace of mind. Not an easy subject, but an absolute necessity. I have a lot to do still, and will definitely follow your outline , as a guide. Thank- you for the hard work, and time. You put into this. I've always said, none of us know when \" our time \" will come. It could be from the cancer -ultimately, or we could step off a sidewalk, and meet an unfortunate end. Or, of course go peacefully in our sleep (my petsonal preference , of course). The diagnosis of cancer , as painful full as it is... does have some benefits, other than the obvious ones. Realizing life is short, enjoy what we have now. Having family, and friends, and even complete strangers offer their support- priceless! And specifically - articles such as yours, that remind us to do what needs to be done. Thank-you, for helping me to be less of a procrastinator. Bye for now. I have to go dance with, and spin my soon-to-be , 2 year-old granddaughter around the living room. Hearing her giggle , will make one of my expanders, the one with seroma , hurt less. May even make my new port for up-coming chemo... feel non-existant. Most-importantly, of course, will be sharing that moment with her, and remembering to try to live , each day, as normally as possible. \" I'm coming ,Ariella .\" Xo Grandma Megan",
