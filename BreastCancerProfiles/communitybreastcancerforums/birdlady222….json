Pearlady, thank you for the link.  I never know where to look on the internet when I have questions like this, and I always end up on some site that ends up scaring me! I ate a normal breakfast today, took my meds, and took a shower.  I feel back to normal.  It's so nice to be able to come here and talk to ladies that understand my problems and concerns.  I hope that my experience helps someone else in the future. Thank you, sisters!  Birdlady                          ",

Good luck to you!",
