It's very comfortable and I can wear it in normal bras, which is nice. I have found that it starts to lose some of its stickiness over time but I've had mine for a year now and it's fine.

The implant should come out as one piece but there will initially be a pocket between the chest muscle and the chest wall where the implant used to be. In a very short time, the muscle settles back down against the chest wall. My PS also told me there is a kind of a ridge that forms below the implant that eventually softens up and goes away. I have found both of these things to be true. It does seem that those who are deconstructed do not end up with a nice flat chest like many of the pictures I have seen of mastectomy scars. I have a kind of gully across my chest. I'm saying this based on the small sample of MB, OLB and myself. This is not something my PS said to me. Sorry you have to go through another surgery but it also sounds as though you will finally be able to feel comfortable. I know I only finally healed when I had the implant removed. Take care and let us know how you are doing. Hugs, Susan",

I first went to the store at the hospital and, while the woman was very nice, they didn't have much of a selection in terms of bras. The fitter at Nordstrom's was so wonderful and patient. Be sure to make an appointment ahead of time so they can match you with someone who knows how to work with mastectomy women. She brought in a ton of different bras and forms and was so helpful but also very matter of fact so I didn't feel uncomfortable. BTW, shrink, that story is absolutely hilarious! My Mom once went to Costco and one cashier shouted over to the other, \"Hey! What's half of two dollars?\"",

Clare64, Thanks for sharing your thoughts about work.  I'm torn because I don't want the stress of work but at the same time, I really liked my co-workers and found my work interesting.  It was a big part of my life so I fear losing the intellectual and social structure.  My husband will be at work all day and my son has high school and sports practices every day.  Since I have worked my whole life, I'm afraid I will just wallow in my fears left home alone all day.  I figure I will take it one day at a time for now.  I can use up sick and vacation days and then long-term leave.  Not really clear on my rights and benefits so I will talk to HR tomorrow.

Perhaps more importantly, I've been through some pretty big emotional phases since the original diagnoses less than a week ago.  As I wrote earlier, I was struck with overwhelming fear and anxiety when I first heard the definitive news from my Oncologist on Saturday.  Same Sunday.  On Monday, I spent the day crying my eyes out, particularly when I had to call my Dad and give him the news.  Tuesday,  I was feeling more lucid.  Still cried a lot but not all day.  Yesterday, I was feeling strong and ready to move forward.  Still sobbed on the table before my breast biopsy but overall feeling good.  Feeling good today too. I've come to terms with the diagnoses and realize that there's nothing I can do to change that fact.  All I can do is try to increase my life expectancy by being proactive about my treatment and taking care of myself.  Part of taking care of myself is improving my diet.  Mostly vegan except for a little fish, no dairy, no white flour or processed sugar.  Basically following the Alkaline diet which my Chinese medicine doctor says is inhospitable to cancer.  Also need to get a lot of sleep to help my body heal.  Also throwing visualization into the mix because it feels good and might help. My friend came over who is an MD and left clinical practice to consult with patients and she got me all prepared for what's to come.  She put together a folder with colored dividers, sticky notes and colored pens to keep track of my doctors, treatments, contact info, insurance info, advanced directive.  She gave me pointers about how to best work with friends who want to help.  Basically some methodologies so that I will feel less overwhelmed by everything.  I felt so much better talking through everything with her. I joined a group of women with breast mets in the Bay Area who are young either now at the time of their first diagnoses (I was 36).  Looking forward to our first meeting next week. Like many of you veterans assured me when I first posted this thread, it does get better.  Thanks so much for those words of wisdom.  I know there will be many rough days ahead but I'm finding I am able to enjoy the good days.

My massage therapist told me that electric heating pads generate a lot of electromagnetic waves. I did some research on it and, although there is no definitive research linking cancer with EMF, it just makes sense that there would be one since EMFs can damage your DNA. I remember wondering about it when I bought the pad but I thought, they wouldn't sell it if it was dangerous. The recent progression I had was at the back of my lung near my spine so I wonder if there is some connection. I mean, they warn people about sleeping too close to an alarm clock and here I was sleeping on this pad for 2-4 hours a night! Just wanted everyone to know.

In my first PET/CT scan one of my lung tumors was 4cm and I didn't even know I had cancer. I would also think, as you do, that it is not new but was missed on the earlier scan. In general, I found the Radiologists to be highly imperfect. I know tons of people who have found out that things were missed on their scans. Big things. I believe part of the problem is we are not assigned a Radiologist the way we are assigned our other doctors. We don't have a relationship with our Radiologists. They just go over scan after scan after scan completely disconnected from the people whose bodies they are analyzing. I had my lung tumor biopsied and the procedure was very quick and simple. There is always a danger of lung collapse but I don't think it's super common and they monitor you after the procedure. If there is a lung collapse, they are right there and they know how to fix it. My MO wanted to be positive that it was breast cancer, not lung cancer. Luckily, it was breast cancer in my lung which has a much better prognosis than lung cancer. Did the CT scan show FDG avidity? If so, I would think it's not some kind of inflammation but I'm no doctor. Hoping for the best for you! Hugs, Susan",

I also have some comfort because my MO is part of a group of doctors who review each other's decisions. There are tumor boards to review a surgeon's work for example so it's not just the surgeon who determines whether the margins were clean. Did your MO go over your previous scan to verify that nothing was there? My brain MRI report talked about a new, post-radiation lesion which was worrisome but my RO looked back at the previous scan and verified that it was already there before my whole brain radiation. Big difference to me, shoddy work by the Radiologist. You are very young to be dealing with all of this but to me you sound very knowledgeable and mature. Hugs, Susan",

In the hospital, they can treat a lung collapse easily if it happens. At least for mine, they just stuck a needle in my back guided by some kind of scan machine, can't remember which kind. My biggest lung tumor was 4cm so hard to miss! Don't know if it will help you but I found that sleeping on my back helped my breathing. I even got a special back sleeping pillow since I was not a back sleeper. Also, though this may sound crazy, my Chinese medicine doctor says that a healthy colon supports healthy lungs.

My boss and I were both always coughing. It got to the point where I was having trouble going to sleep at night. Once, running through the airport to catch a flight, I started wheezing. Still didn't figure it out until I went to the Opthamologist and he found the tumor in my eye, had brain MRI and PET/CT scan. Ever since I've been treated, first with Tamoxifen and now Xeloda, the cough has gone away and my breathing is fine. Hoping for the best for you. Hugs, Susan",

I've got a lung met that has shrunk and has a very low SUV but is really my last remaining evidence of disease. The last two scans it seems to be stable. Originally 4cm, it is now 2.8cm x 1.2 cm, SUV 1.6. My MO mentioned perhaps doing targeted radiation on it. Has anyone done targeted radiation on a single lung met? Wondering what the downsides would be of such treatment. Not sure I should do anything. I've had my brain, eye and femur bone radiated and the treatment was absolutely effective in getting rid of those tumors with very few side effects. Don't know if lung radiation is more difficult.

Not having to go to the infusion center for treatment is so convenient. Did a lot of traveling. I did have hand/foot syndrome but was able to keep it under control (Heel balm plus exfoliation on the feel. Hand cream every time I washed my hands. Tried to avoid harsh soaps). When it got really bad I took an extra week off. If possible, see if you can get on a 1 week on/1 week off schedule. That made all the difference in my SEs. Xeloda didn't seem to shrink my lung tumors much but everything else (eye, brain, bone, breast) seemed to respond very well.

First of all, the centers they built were so expensive that most of them went bankrupt. Studies showed that proton therapy wasn't any better than target radiation therapy and the proton therapy was much more expensive. A friend of mine had proton therapy on her chest and her chest literally melted down the front of her body. A chain has been buying them up but most of the experts left when they were bought out. She had hers recently and the doctor who did it didn't know what he was doing. Scripps in San Diego had a proton therapy unit and they sold it to a chain called California Protons Cancer Therapy Center. How were your scans? Hugs, Susan",

Studies of reconstruction with implants after radiation in particular show failure rates of 60%+. The following quote is from a medical paper: \"For example, a study conducted by implant manufacturer Inamed found that 46% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery within the first 2 to 3 years after getting silicone gel breast implants2 - more than twice as high as the 21% reported by Henriksen et al. One explanation is that the women in the Henriksen study had breast implants for an average of only 23 months, compared to 2-3 years in the Inamed study. Henriksen et al reported that 31% developed at least one serious complication and 16% developed at least 2 serious complications. The Inamed study reported that 25% underwent implant removal, 16% experienced Baker III-IV capsular contracture, 6% experienced necrosis, 6% had breast pain, and 6% had scarring, in addition to infections and other complications.2\"  In other words, it's not something you did so don't beat yourself up.  - Susan ",

That's an amazing story about the woman in her 19th year of MBC.  I know a woman from our MBC group that is in her 15th year.  We have so many more treatment options than they had 15 or 19 years ago!  I hope your energy continues to get better.  Rest, eat healthily and exercise if you can. We are always here for you too! Hugs, Susan",

It's such a heartbreaking story but in some ways, I think our kids will grow up that much more empathetic and kind going through this with us. We never want our kids to experience any hardship but, in truth, life is full of challenges. Joys, but also challenges. If we can model for them how we can enjoy life even faced with the challenges of MBC, that is a lesson they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. Last night, I had a long conversation about death with my 16 year old son. He said he was terrified of the thought that he would some day die. It was a good opportunity to discuss our thoughts on life and death. I told him that I wasn't afraid of dying and that I had a good life with no regrets. I also told him that I don't know that death is the end, it may be the beginning. We have no way of knowing. All we can do is live life to it's fullest every day. A friend of mine who died a couple of months ago of MBC loved this poem, \"Open closed open. Before we are born, everything is open in the universe without us. For as long as we live, everything is closed within us. And when we die, everything is open again. Open closed open. That's all we are.\" Love and light, Susan",

I've been working hard to explain to my Mom that, while I believe that a positive attitude is important, it's also not good to have unrealistic expectations.  For example, she told me, you just have to believe that the treatments are getting rid of all of your cancer.  I said, I try to think that but the fact is, I have a gigantic tumor in my breast that I can touch and measure any time so it doesn't make sense for me to think that it is all gone.  ",

Takes a bit of getting used to in terms of the direct contact with your skin but, as Carol said, it moves with your body and a lot of the weight is taken off of your shoulders and is where you would feel the weight of a real breast. Also as Carol said, the form is not designed to be worn without a bra. You could wear it with a strapless bra. There is another kind of contact form that can be worn without a bra. I believe you attached some tape to your skin and then the tape attaches to the form. Probably not something you'd want to wear every day but it would be great for those times when you have an evening dress or something and can't wear a bra. I've been wanting to try it on.

I wore one to dance class today and it was very comfortable. The pocket for the prosthesis is a little small for my regular prosthesis.

The harder issue was how much to tell the other families at school.  He didn't want anyone to know initially but I warned him that once I lost all of my hair people would figure it out.  He said that was fine.  The funny thing is, none of his friends even noticed anything different about me.  I wrote to each of their parents and each on said their sons hadn't noticed anything.  Just goes to show they don't even look at us!

Physical objects are so easy to lose. I don't want my kids worrying about losing some kind of object that I made for them before dying. They are pretty scatterbrained and lose things all the time (keys, wallets, etc.). I think a lot depends on how old your kids are. My kids are 21 and 17 so they don't need a card or video to remember me. I tell them all the time how much I love them and show it by my actions. That is what's most important to me. To write that down in a card would just be redundant. If I had really young kids, my attitude would be very different. I tend to agree with lbgal's approach in general that I want them to move forward in their lives and not dwell too much on the past. What's important is that they're happy, not that they think about me all the time or have some kind of a shrine to me. I feel the same way about my husband. I hope he will fall in love again and find someone to spend the rest of his life with. I don't want him pining away for me and being sad and depressed. Whenever he suggests something I don't want to do, like live on a boat, I say \"You can do that with your second wife!\" :-) ",

This board has been a great help to me as well as Barbara's site, www.breastfree.org. Take care, Susan ",

While many of us have come to accept living without breasts I'm sure most of us would do a lot to have our old breasts back. At the same time, fear is an important mechanism that keeps us out of trouble and shouldn't be viewed as a weakness. In many ways its easier for me to accept being boobless because I've been through a failed reconstruction. After a year of debilitation and seven surgeries, I know I gave it my best shot. To have a healed chest, even without a breast, is far better than the open wound, discomfort and hideous foob I had been dealing with.  Perhaps when your children are older you will feel comfortable about having DIEP surgery. Maybe by that time they will figure out a better way to perform the surgery. A lot has changed in reconstructive surgery in a very short time. Certainly the options won't get any worse if you wait.

I haven't been able to find a suit in anything smaller than a size 6 (American). I usually wear a size 4 and I know there is another woman who frequents this board who is a size 2. The basic problem is that the average age for women with breast cancer is 64 so they design everything with that average age in mind. However, the age range is very wide with cases of breast cancer in some as young as 15 and many in their twenties and thirties. I found an Anita suit that I like after much research though it is a bit large for me. Moreover, I am 43 and have two kids. I wouldn't have worn a suit like that in my twenties or early thirities. There is a place on this board for young women with breast cancer. Perhaps you could ask them. I am sure they underserved when it comes to mastectomy swim suits. Hopefully, your school project will some day turn into real garments! I wish the mastectomy garment manufacturers would ask us what we need!",

I made an appointment with a Therapist for him on Tuesday but we pretty much have to force him to go.  He was worried that someone would see him going to the appointment and worried that it would be a really awful hour.  I told him, it probably won't be fun but we want you to have someone you can talk to because the situation will get tougher.  Perhaps because I look and feel pretty much the same at this point he doesn't really understand.  I've had early stage BC when he was 2 and then again when he was 8 but I got better so I'm not sure he understands that this is a much graver situation even though I have explained it to him.  Also, he was so young those other times, I doubt he understood much of what was going on. The other thing I think about which is sad and comforting at the same time is that children are ultimately very resilient.  I unfortunately know multiple families who have experienced the death of a parent and as sad as it is, life does go on.  In particular, young children seem to do very well.  Of course, everyone is better off without a deceased parent but I don't think most of us need to worry that our children will lead unhappy lives because we are gone.  I hope this doesn't sound insensitive.    ",

My son had a really hard time last year after I was diagnosed. He's also 16, a tough time of life no matter what. He has been seeing a therapist. Not every week because it's tough during soccer season, but when he can. I don't know what they talk about but I have seen a gradual improvement in his attitude and he always seems happier when I pick him up from a session. I have a friend who is also Stage IV and she's also in the position where, when she goes, her son will have no other direct family. He will have a stepfather and step siblings who are much older. Her parents are both gone and she has no siblings either. She set up a trust for him with specific instructions about what trust money can be used for, education, heathcare, etc. Once he is 35 those restrictions will be lifted. Something to think about. So sorry to hear that you are in a lot of pain. I'm sure, like me, you're determined to make it at least until high school graduation. Hopefully we will even see college graduation! Big hugs, Susan",

I think that's ridiculous that your plastic surgeon told you you were \"too fat\". Some women don't have enough extra flesh for reconstruction using their own tissue but I find it hard to believe you could have too much. That being said, if reconstruction is not important to you why go through unnecessary surgery? I had a unilateral and I'm a 32DD. I'm not nearly as big as you but I have ambivalent feelings about whether or not I should have had a bilateral. If I had a bilateral I would definitely opt for a couple of B cup prosthesis. Finding a bra and fitting clothes would be much easier. That would be nice. On the other hand, I would assume bilaterals have a more difficult recovery. I also like my one remaining breast and don't want to lose it. There are certainly many large-breasted women who have been transformed by breast reduction surgery. No more back pain, slimmer silhouette, etc. I can imagine that you could enjoy some of those benefits by having a bilateral. I know there are some bigger breasted women who post here. As Carol said, I'm sure they'll be along soon with some better advice. Take care, Susan ",

I had a failed reconstruction and felt so relieved to get rid of that implant. It felt and looked like I had a softball under my chest muscle. Also, to me, it looked more gruesome than my scar looks now though I don't have the prettiest scar. Most of us wish we could have our breasts back, but unfortunately, that's just not going to happen. I applaud those who feel brave enough to go without a prosthesis. I'm not ready for that yet. Perhaps if I were bilateral, I could do it once in awhile. Someone once posted here that she went without protheses and someone saw her and went out and got a mammogram. Perhaps if we were all more open about our lack of breasts we could increase awareness about the importance of preventive measures to combat breast cancer. - Susan",

I had a unilateral mast but figure it is just a matter of time before something shows up in the other breast. First diagnosed at 36, recurrence in the same breast at 42, now almost 44. What are the chances in the next 40-50 years my remaining breast will be unaffected? Like you, I am a hard to fit 32DD and often think life would be easier had I had a bilateral. As Barbara says, when you have a bilateral you can pick your size. A perky B-cup would be nice! Also, I'm sure your choices of clothes will be much broader when you are a bilateral because there won't be the mismatch at the upper part of your breast. You should be able to use Carol's fashion tape trick and wear lower cut tops. I know for me, I can't wear anything that shows below my collar bone. Surgery is always scary and losing your remaining breast must be very difficult. We will be here to support you. Hugs, Susan ",

There is a pebbly, sticky back to it. I really love it since I can wear regular bras with it. The stickiness does decrease over time but it still works fine inside of a regular bra. It is most comfortable in a full coverage type of bra so I did buy new bras to wear with it but at least I had more of a selection. It is not so comfortable to work out in so for that I usually wear a regular form in a Janac sports bra. The contact form does come with a backing so you can put it in a mast bra with a pocket but I had an old regular form that I use since I have it already. If I had to pick just one form, I would buy the contact form. Sizing should be the same as other Amoena forms so you can try on regular Amoena forms, find your size, and then order the contact form on-line. I bought my contact form at Nordstrom. I doubt you will be able to return it. I wear a 32DD bra and a size 7 form. - Susan Carol, I think you told me before but what kind of stick-on nipples do you use? It's a great idea and I'd like to try it out.",

Did you try a lot of differents types of prosthesis when you went in for the fitting? There are a huge range of different types.  I didn't like my first prosthesis but have been very happy with the second. The right bra is also an important part of the whole package. If your bra doesn't fit right, the prosthesis won't feel comfortable. I found that my around the chest measurement went down quite a bit, perhaps because they removed the tissue under my arm. Be sure to get fit for the right bra by someone who knows how do do these things. I found that the people at Nordstrom were very helpful and patient. Part of it is also just getting used to the change. Now, less than a year out, my prosthesis pretty much feels like a part of my body. I just notice it when I bump into something and it doesn't have any feeling. Also, check out Barbara's web site, www.breastfree.org for other helpful tips! Hugs, Susan",
