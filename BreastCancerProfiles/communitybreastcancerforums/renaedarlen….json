I had never juiced before, but my dear neighbors bought me a juicer. I am so excited about it! If you read my response to AlaskanAngel you can get my take on it.  Also, there's a website, I think if you Google Crazy, Sexy, Cancer...I can't remember names for anything, but her book on juicing is coming out on Valentine's Day and I am buying my copy!! You will love this girl, she is amazing as is her blog and she is all about the veggies. I understand completely your dilemma. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, one other determining factor for me was that I asked my oncologist if I could take the test which shows if my body will even metabolize the Tamoxifen.  She said they don't do that at Stanford anymore because it is simply not reliable. I mention Stanford because although I know they aren't Number 1 - they are rated at the 15th best cancer hospital in the Nation. People fly in from all over go get in, so I usually take their expertise pretty seriously. Nevertheless, being me, I ask A LOT of questions.  I went in with a page of typed up questions, true to my form, with underlined bolded headings. LOL. One question was -- how do they know if my body is going to even metabolize the Tamoxifen? \"We don't know.\" \"You DON'T KNOW???\" \"No, but we believe it will.\"  That wasn't good enough for me, as Tamoxifen was my insurance policy.  Then I researched what happens when we are DONE taking the Tamoxifen in five years....I hope someone will correct me if I'm wrong....but my take is \"There are no studies that show the dormant cells won't behave like a genie in a bottle and peek their heads out once the Tamoxifen is no longer being taken.\"  That scared me.  So, I could very well have little evil cells partying in my blood stream, and the only thing they are offering is a less than perfect insurance policy. So, if Tamoxifen is my insurance policy, then I'm using the chemotherapy as the umbrella policy, just in case. Most of the time, the chemo effects are short term - not all the time...but I'd rather be a few brain cells short (which I already am so what the heck) and drop of a few dishes then always be looking behind my back and wondering if my body is having a cancer party.  If you have an email address I could send an attachment with all the questions I asked my own onc. in case there is something on there you haven't thought of.  Last week was one of the most overwhelming weeks for me....there I was pushing a cart in the library, and writing notes with every question I had and so scared I would miss a question or two.  The LVI was too readily dismissed for my liking and just because a duck doesn't have it's DNA tested to prove it's a duck, doesn't mean it's not. Basically, if it quacks like a duck and acts like a duck, it might just be a duck...but in the world of science and medicine, if the proof isn't there, it is not typically on the table.  I called the LVI a duck because I was not convinced that it wasn't. Chemo is typically short time...our lives, our children needing us, our grandchildren....that's long term. Now my cousin, she absolutely refused chemo because it's putting poison into her body. That's another perspective on chemo that you have to take into consideration. In the end, it's your decision. You will feel better once you make it. Let me know if you want my list of questions.  ~Renae~ ",

What is a bit distressing to me is they didn't find evidence of cancer in the right breast until after the bilateral and I wonder why that wouldn't have shown up on an MRI. My understanding was that the left breast was invasive, and it appears she had a lumpectomy first, which I didn't know - I thought she had an immediate bilateral. I do know that I respect her decision very much, also because lobular is a sneaky cancer that tends to mirror itself in the other breast (as it did)... I am thinking that the 24% recurrence is because I did not do the bilateral, but then again, it wasn't a consideration by the tumor board as none of them felt it was necessary in my case. Unfortunately, I have an $8,900 insurance deductible, so the BCCTP kicked in to pick up the deductible and once that is reached my Anthem Blue Cross pays 100% of the rest.  However, Anthem does have to approve the treatment.  I think they will pick up the BRCA test, but I have tg reach my deductible first and I believe it has started over with the new year.  Chemo should take care of that and then, even if my insurance won't cover it, I would only have to come up with 50%, which is still a lot for me in my situation at the moment.  I haven't always been in this position but under the circumstances I can't tap into the equity in my house and I certainly didn't expect the economy to collapse when I left my field of work to go back to school.  So here I am, grateful for all the programs that are helping me through this.  I spent 27 years in the legal field, so I definitely paid into it...am just glad it's here for me when I need it.  So yes, I'm working on getting the BRCA covered.  That's great that you were covered.  By the way, I adopted both of my daughters.  They are the greatest joys I have ever known in life. I was so lucky and I believe they were meant to be my girls. :)   Hair -- I am expecting to lose all my hair and I am not really too concerned about that. Vanity becomes unimportant when we are looking at the big picture.  That would be wonderful if I could get some assistance through my insurance for a wig. I love what you did with yours! There may also be some local wig banks I can look into...and I've figured how to make a few of my own with the REAL hair I bought at Walmart! I might come up with something kind of cool for pretty cheap actually.  But it still would be nice to have a wig. By the way, are there wig stores that will accept the prescription and then bill your insurance once they've approved it? How does that work?? Or do you buy the wig and send the bill to the insurance company after they've approved it? Wow this is so new to me.  I'll bypass the cold caps, I just wonder how my hair will come back when it grows back.    Your decision to have a BMX was a good instinct, just like my cousin. She said \"take them off.\"  I was in shock and not quite as comfortable with that decision, but if that were on the table at a later date, I have my brain around it this time.  The nipple sparing is a wonderful procedure.  I believe one of the surgeons for UCSF was part of that discovery and progress. I haven't watched or even heard of Cash Cab, I'll have to check that out one day when I am finally not obsessing over breast cancer.  I have become extremely obsessive over understanding this foreign language that can be life or death...hard to pull myself away from it.  Yes, Alaska.  It was on Good Friday, 1964.  I slept through it.  My brother was watching Fireball XL5 and my mother was hanging on to her new chandallier in the kitchen while it swung back and forth.  I believe it was a 9. something. I do remember the devastation of the Northridge quake though.  Well if they ever have a breast cancer jeopardy...you would definitely take the cake on that one!!!! Thanks again, your information is invaluable to me...and your support. ~Renae~ ",

I have more energy than I ever have since I cut out the \"crap\" and started putting good nutrients into my body. Lately I have started juicing veggies. I found that I enjoy the green juice better with an ice cube or two and am going to add a slice of pineapple or orange, plop in a strawberry and buy those little umbrellas.  Why we have no juice bars in my town is beyond me.  Our body is our temple and it is never too late to start.  The oncotype test is such a small weight compared to the overall picture, and we DO have control of boosting our immune system.  For me, I've started slowly and eased into this new lifestyle so that it becomes habit not a temporary thing.

I almost wanted a high score so that I could rationalize the need for pulling out the big guns and blowing this to he.. and back. I am sorry to hear about your multi-focal disease, and the frustration you must have over trying to decide on having a BMX.  I've even considered that now AFTER I've had a \"successful\" breast sparing surgery - although they took part of my breast. The more I research the more questions I have.  So, I'm confused with the different recurrence scores, esp. with the family history which I don't think the oncotype takes into consideration nor the vascular invasion. Can anyone enlighten me, ASAP? Does finding out mean the chemo may not do me any good mean I am resistant to chemo, or just that they think their wouldn't be any cells to fight?  I'm right here with all of you, fighting the madness.  Thank you for being there.

That is another consideration for me.  Thank you for sharing your own information!  Also, did you take the test to determine how your body metabolizes your Tamoxifen? I will be asking for that.  Funny (if there is anything funny about BC) - but I used the term \"crap shoot\" about a hundred times yesterday. That pretty much says it all.  Thanks again for your input. SpecialK - thank you also. I'll look at the path report but I was under the impression that all those figures were assessed on the Oncotype DX test. Perhaps I am wrong. The only aspect I thought wasn't part of the equation was the LVI, which is what concerns me the most. I don't believe the docs take it as seriously as I think they should because of the lack of clinical trials to support it, but everything I've found on credible sites on the deep web point in the direction that it is considered to be an indicator of future metastasis.  In fact, the American Cancer Society believes it should be used as an indicator for staging.  Yet...no studies, no proof.  Ahhhhh the dang gray area, it is hell. Hate to admit, but I was mentally prepared for the chemo, the hair loss, the fatigue, the possible long term problems, in hoping to save my own life for more than 5-10 year statistics.  But if the chemo may not do any good then I see no point. The question is, \"What's my line in the sand?\"  I'm really not so sure.  A low score has to be pretty low to convince me otherwise. Wondering if I'm a fool, or just crazy, or just a typical cancer patient in survival mode.  The minute I second guess myself I ask myself \"Are any of the doctors going to be at my funeral? Probably not.\"  And so, I am equipping myself to make the best decision possible, with all the information I have.  Oh, by the way, I am being seen at Stanford. Initially I went before a tumor board of some of the best breast cancer specialists in the Nation. There were over ten of them that examined me and looked at all my diagnostics to determine the best outcome.  Guess what? They couldn't agree.  There you have it, when Stanford doctors have four different opinions on a course of initial treatment (I chose central lumpectomy with radiation)  it tells me we have to be proactive.  Crazy cancer.",

I will tell you what my final straw was to decide on chemo even with an 11.  The doctor said this puts me in a 5-15% recurrence rate, there is no way to tell which, that's the general percentage.  We spoke facts, studies, statistics, but for me what it came down to is this.... I have two daughters.  I am it for them - their only parent. Our extended family lives far.  I am their life and they are mine.  If the cancer ever comes back, even in ten years and it is metastatic, I need to look them in the eyes and have them know that without fail, I did everything I could to prevent it, to be here for them, and for hopefully my grandchildren one day.  I never want to die thinking \"I should have done the chemo.\" and that is what sealed the deal for me.  I'm not afraid of chemo., I will tough it out, I will take whatever side effects are thrown at me, even in the long haul. And, I feel a tremendous sense of relief already, just knowing that the decision is made, and because I've done everything I can, I won't need to continuously second guess myself or look over my shoulder.  The psychological aspect for me was a big part of my decision, regardless of those that may think I should have opted out because of the low score.  I, personally, think 5-15% is too broad of a range, and anything over 8% is way too high. Call me selfish, I just want every insurance available to me possible.  I hope this might give you some ideas to consider and I just want yhou to know that once the decision is made, you will breathe a sigh of relief.  You are not alone.  ~Renae~ ",

The neuropathy information you gave me is incredibly helpful.  So here's a little glitch for me.  My dad has severe peripheral neuropathy (can barely walk, falls often, can't pick things up).  His has no known source, no diabetes, no vitamin deficiency, so it's not cureable.  In the past year (about the age he was when his started), my hands and feet have been going weak and numb quite often.  Unfortunately, with my high deductible, I couldn't afford to see a neurologist.  As luck would have it, because it now goes under my \"cancer care\" I will be seeing a Stanford neurologist to make sure that they are in agreement with the oncologist re: which chemo to give me and to that it doesn't exacerbate what i already have.  The silver lining is that I actually finally get to have a neurologist look at me and possibly tell me if I've inherited my dad's neuropathy, or if my spine is the source...which leads to another specialist visit.  I had secondary tb of the bone (Potts Disease) as a child, so I have to meet also with an infectious disease specialist to decide the best way to keep the TB dormant under the circumstances of my immune system being attacked.  I don't think there is a problem but there are so many twists and turns to my situation.  So, the cool thing is that you've given me names of vitamins? that can possibly help my current neuropathy issue.  Is this something I can buy over the counter or a prescription? I am really interested in what you mentioned, although I will run it by my onc first before I take it.  But that sounds REALLY hopeful.  Thank you for all the great information! ~Renae~",

You just know to much to be the average breast cancer patient.  Then again, maybe in a few years I'll have all this memorized...or I'll completely forget all of it and black out this part of my life.  That's funny about Jeopardy. You'll go for the BMX but you'll bypass the chance of Jeopardy for fear of not knowing the answers. Oh, the things that hold us back in life. Well, at least you get to enjoy it from your couch.  Me? I'm the person that can't watch Jeopardy because I'm snapping my fingers going \"I know that answer! I know that answer! What IS it???\" -- my mind blanks.  Then again, I don't know most answers so I just feel dumb. LOL.  I don't think I'm in menopause yet, however, my onc did mention switching in a few years to the aromatase inhibitor.  Maybe when I'm in menopause? She took my blood to establish where I'm at, but at this point, I think I'm a late bloomer. I do have a question for you.  Neither my mother nor my half-sister have had breast cancer, however....both first aunts and one cousin.  All of them early stage but my cousin had lobular which tends to mirror itself in both sides, so she had a BMX (assuming that stands for bilateral mastectomy?) She didn't do the chemo, radiation, or drugs but has given a 1% chance of recurrence.  She feels that I too should have done the bilateral.  I was not even given that as an option.  My greatest concern is the cancer coming back somewhere else...hence the chemo, radiation, and Tamoxifen...but she was told with the bilateral she only had a 1% chance of recurrence.  I have trouble believing that 1% includes a distant recurrence, but she did not want the chemo and under the 1% recurrence rate opted out of any treatment.  There is some scuttle in the family that I should have just had a bilateral and be done with it...based on family history, but I was never given a bilateral as an option unless my BRCA was positive, and I decided to wait until I can afford it to have the BRCA and then if necessary do a bilateral and have my ovaries removed.  But wait -- why are we being given different recurrence rates? If I was told by the Stanford Genetic Specialist that I have a 24% chance of recurrence based on family history, but there is only a 5% differential between a mastectomy and a lumpectomy with radiation, how does all that tie in? I feel like we have been given very different percentages. I also have a 5-15% chance of distant recurrence and apparently, she has none.?  I don't understand.  If this makes any sense whatsoever to you, do you have a take on it? I do know the new standard of care at the universities for early breast cancer is breast sparing surgery (lumpectomy with radiation)....so I chose that. I also had my nipple and aereola taken because it appeared that it might be growing into it.  I could have done chemo first to shrink the tumor, but I didn't want to chance it so I said - take the nipple.  I have this feeling my decisions are being questioned through the family grapevine.  Then, when I told my aunt I was having chemo for the cancer she responded with \"YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER!!!\" Wow....I feel like instead of jeopardy I am in a family breast cancer competition.  I do believe we call it \"in remission\" as they can't prove once we have it that we are cured of cancer; but I may be wrong. Some days, I want to crawl in a hole. Oh, and I went out today to buy stuff in Walmart to make a few of my own little cute hats with hair.  Walmart has a section of black product with tight nylon caps and REAL hair for $7.00.  I thought I could make a cool little hairpiece that I could wear a baseball hat over so it appears that I have a little hair sticking out.  The response was \"YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR HAIR!!!\" Well, I'd rather prepare now than lose it and be exhausted and freaked out for not being prepared.  I think I'll go scream in my pillow now. Okay, thanks for listening and love your input.  ~Renae~ p.s.  No Googling.  When and where was the largest earthquake in U.S. and North American History? That's your Jeopardy question of the night. :)",

I've already had people questioning my decision to have chemo even though my onco score was only an 11...I've decided that we each have one body and we make the best decisions we can with them.  But here goes.  Although our situation is similar, my tumor was only a 1.8 cm.  It's sounds like with the size of what they thought was two tumors but is now one - that would put you into a higher stage.  Now for me, my wild card was the Lymphovascular Invasion.  I found in my research that because this hasn't been \"proven\" by any long term clinical trials -- nor has it been disproven, that the LVI was an important factor that left me not feeling confident that those little party animal evil cells weren't left running through my bloodstream.  I chose a random number for my onco score, 11 - based on a few different things I read.  For one, I chose 11 because there is a clinical trial which will not result until 2015, where they are studying the possibility of a benefit of chemo AND anti-hormone drugs on anyone with an oncotype of 11 and up.  Now let's say they found both to be more beneficial...then I would regret not having chemo if I had fallen below the \"low\" 17 range.  I kept wondering why they were taking this number down to 11 when 17 was considered low -- but apparently, someone out there must think that an 11 would benefit from BOTH treatments.  Then, I added my LVI (Invasion) to that, which the oncologist said \"Let's take that off the table.\"  Understandably, they can only go by the facts they have in front of them based on long term studies....but everything I read seemed to correlate a connection between LVI and future metastasis.  Ironically, my number was AN 11.  Go figure. And so I chose the chemo.  I will have four rounds as opposed to six.  Lastly and most importantly.  I never want to be on my death bed and have to look into my daughters' eyes and say \"I'm sorry, I should have tried the chemo.\" Or leave them thinking \"Why didn't mom do the chemo?\"  And although that is a very personal situation for me...that was why I made the decision that I did.  I am not afraid of chemo. Maybe I should be, but I'm eating everything healthy that I can, I'm juicing, I'm doing everything I can to keep my body strong and if I go a little brain crazy or have long term side effects (which I know can happen), I will still mentally feel a sense of knowing I did it so I wouldn't always wonder.  I hope that helps and please know, you are not alone. Once I made the decision, I went into the waiting room, put my head in my hands, and bawled like a baby.  I was so overwhelmed, and so relieved.  Stay strong. ~Renae~ p.s. my blog is http://goodnewscolumn.blogspot.com - there are a lot of random cancer stories on there that I write about, mixed with funny random things that make me laugh. :)",

Also, my grade is a 2 and I've read that a grade 3 throws you into chemo.  Everything seems to be on the fence for me.  I am a stage 1, but so close to a stage 2.  Unfortunately, every statistic I am given is different so I don't even know what to believe.  I suppose it depends on which software they use and what they calculate when they determine the stats. I will definitely be put on Tamoxifen for five years and I am also 95% ER+ which is a good thing.  Did you take any sort of test to see if your body matobolates the Tamoxifen? How are you doing with side effects?  I was told with the only radiation there is a 23% chance of recurrence, with Tamoxifen, a 16% and with all three including chemo, there is an 8% according to my information.  I think the Oncotype will truly be the determining factor.  So I'm not sure what \"mitosis\" means or how is it determined? Is that the grade? If so, I'm a 2.  Can you give me a website that you use for the calculations? I have a second opinion with Stanford on February 8, so far I feel very confident with their care.  Ultimately, I have to make this unfortunate decision.  Thanks for all your help and I wish the absolute best for you.

I really don't know anything about the cycles or types of chemo so I have to pass this over to SpecialK if she doesn't mind taking it. She is quite the expert here.

My MRI came out fine for my left breast, but I am having some constant discomfort directly under the nipple. I was told they would keep an eye on it, and my onc gave me an exam (my MRI was recent), but how do they keep an eye on it if it's lobular and can't find it????? Maybe I need to start a new thread on that one.  Very scary thought. Hence, perhaps that's why my cousin feels a bilateral would have been better for me...but then, perhaps the chemo would take care of it???

I don't know why she thinks that 1% might include distant recurrence, but after all this I have two concerns.  My main being distant recurrence, which I'll be taking the chemo (and thx, now I understand the decision) Tamoxifen and radiation for; and my second concern the chance of a sneaky lobular cancer popping up.  Perhaps for that I should have considered the BMX but at the time, the focus was on the right breast and nothing showed up in imaging on the left breast. I do wonder how they caught hers when it was so small? She was very fortunate. So there's another wild card...the dang sneaky lobular and how to catch it before it grows. Maybe they are counting on the chemo and Tamoxifen if anything were to be sneaking around in there. Another question for my doc this week.  Thank you again. ~Renae~ ",

I love her honesty.  Okay, back to the link here....So I'm thinking there is a high possibility your Onco will be low because of your ER+/PR+, that seems to have a correlation with a low onco score. What size was your tumor? Also, check to see your path report to see if you had a lymphovascular invasion. That was a huge factor for me. You may have already mentioned it but my brain is a little fried (okay, a lot fried)...look into the TailorX clinical trial. I hope I spelled that right. That was another factor.  They are using the number 11-25 to see if the combo of chemo and anti-hormones would be beneficial, but the results won't come out until 2015.  I didn't want to find out in 2015 that I would have benefited from chemo, so I chose my line in the sand as 11 and above for chemo, even though the docs were thrilled that I had an 11.  My latest blog post \"This is Cancer\" talks about that.  Thanks for reading it by the way! Love your feedback.  If it helps, I was EXTREMELY stressed and anxiety ridden prior to making my decision and receiving my onco results. Once I made my decision, I sat down, bawled like a baby, and felt tremendous relief.  Now it's all about what I can control (i.e. diet, exercise, vs. what I can't control) and letting my treatment run its course.  Have a beautiful Sunday. ~Renae~",

Thanks for reinforcing and reminding me. I don't know if you've followed all the posts, but my dad has peripheral neuropathy. The only thing that keeps him going is his mind has his body has failed him...and his love of computers and research of the stock market. Unfortunately, I started getting the achy legs and tingling in the hands and feet a few years ago. Couldn't afford to see a neurologist, but now it should be covered through my breast cancer coverage. I guess if I can see a silver lining, it's to actually be able to see a neurologist now to find out if I too will follow in my father's footsteps or if it stems from an earlier trauma of my spine. I definitely will find a way to get the BRCA, if I have to charge it on my own...I adopted my daughters so my ovaries never did me any good anyway.  If my BRCA were to come out positive then I would definitely have the BMX decision made for me even though it hasn't been on the table as of now.  I'm just jumping through hoops as they come up....what's that Chucky Cheese game where those little things pop up and you keep trying to punch them down but then others pop up? That's where I'm at with BC at the moment.  Oh my goodness, what a wild ride this is.  Enjoy your Sunday. ~Renae~ ",

The psychological aspect for me of a BMX.  See, I went through two years of what I have to say for me is worse than this breast cancer...infertility in my mid-20's. The thought of my body failing me and not being able to have children was devastating. I went through so much testing, surgeries, etc., until they basically said \"sorry.\"  Emotionally, it destroyed my mid to late 20's but thankfully adopting was a no-brainer for me.  I only wish my friends that are suffering could make the decision to adopt as easy as I did because I was given what I wanted all along....children.  But psychologically, I have to wonder if that deep rooted fear of losing my breasts is linked in to my old thoughts of my body failing me. Of never having been able to use them even to breast feed, and, just like my ovaries and my uterus...useless.  Not too long ago I had uterine complications so that was taken also. Perhaps I am holding on to my breasts for reasons that go far beyond logic, and knowing the doctors didn't put a BMX on the table as an option brought me great relief. Yet for all I know, I should have had one for triple insurance (on top of chemo, radiation, and Tamoxifen). But I am holding on to the breasts for dear life.  Never thought about the psychological aspect within myself. It really temporarily destroyed me to lose my nipple and aereola, even though that was minimal in comparison. I just have to wonder what's really going on in my own head... ",

Yes, your tumor was larger than mine and you had the one node, so I can see that the chemo would be more clearcut, but with me also, there will be that looking over my shoulder all the time. I don't want regret.  Thanks for your reply. :)",

What does the \"T\" in TC stand for and how is this \"chemo lite\" affecting you?? Thanks! ~Renae~ p.s. off to work until this evening when I can begin my obsessing again and another sleepless night.

I feel very strongly about my decision even with the low number of 11. My MO said that was a 5-15% recurrence rate which is just not in my comfort zone.  Even if the chemo only takes me down 5%, I call it my umbrella policy....the Tamoxifen being the insurance policy. I was really relieved to read how well you are taking it.  My only concern is the small bit of neuropathy I already have, but I think that's due to an old back injury so chemo may not exacerbate it if that's the case.  I will see a neurologist before starting the chemo.  Anyway, I will sleep well now and I was really happy to reread your earlier posts knowing you are handling this so well.  I'm almost afraid I might use the chemo as an excuse to take a day or two off to catch up on my reading. God forbid. LOL.  I just started \"The Help\" and can't put the book down! Fortunately, I have an amazing amount of support at work, only work part time, and they will do whatever they need to to accommodate my needs.  I am truly fortunate.  I only work part time so my hours are somewhat flexible.  I work at the public library and couldn't ask for a better position to be in with work as far as going through this.  Also, you have inspired me to get a treadmill.  I absolutely can't use the chemo as an excuse not to exercise.  I'm also on a mission to start juicing and learning everything I can about nutrition.  So far, I've slowly incorporated veggies into my daily diet (imagine that!) and am taking 2000 IU's of D3 every day, and using fresh turmeric with pepper in my food.  That is a start for me.  Look out world, HERE I COME!! haha, thanks for your great posts and please keep me up to date on your .... last round of chemo?  I will be thinking of you and you are quite an inspiration.  ~Renae~ ",

Of course, I know in reality we learn from one another, we pay it forward, we are all in this together, but I just wanted you to know that for me your help has been priceless. So here's another question, would it be better for everyone if I posted all my responses to each person on one post or on separate as I am doing now? I am new to the forum so I am not sure if I am complicating matters by writing each note separately.   I think I forgot to offer one response to a previous post - I am looking into the BRCA but as both of my daughters are adopted we don't have the gene issue/family history so they don't carry my genes, thank God. ~Renae~ ",
