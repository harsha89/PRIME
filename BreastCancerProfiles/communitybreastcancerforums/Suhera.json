At a still pre-menopausal 54 I should have known better but I've always been leary of doctors, labs, tests...ugh. No cancer in family, breast-fed 3 kids, walk a lot, heck I sure eat a lot of broccoli....!! ...but you just never know. Did regular self-exams...nothing. One day sitting at table reading eating toast scratching armpit I notice grape-sized lump floating just beneath the skin in center of armpit, nowhere close to breast. Figured I'd mention it to doc next checkup, coming up soon. Wow. Went from 0-50 getting on THAT train. 2 weeks later I was in surgery, and awaiting test results and more scheduled scans to see how far advanced the cancer might be. Scary stuff indeed. Well sorry I didn't mean to ramble on so this early - already pumped up on steroids for today's chemo and got notepad full of questions for the good doctor, haha....!",

Seems like every time I Google a concern of mine I end up at these forums...figured I may as well join and say HI to all the fine and very helpful folks I've seen posting here :D ...I'm a bit past halfway thru my (6) chemo treatments - go in for session #5 (TC) tomorrow - have been holding up fairly well so far but side effects are definitely hitting me harder, and 'good days' are getting fewer...sigh  ...I do have a big dog that forces me to go out walking every day and I think that really helps...even when I don't feel like it...lol Take care everyone....and hang in there!!",

It is odd, the strange node behavior but so then again so much about cancer is senseless.... and congrats Jenwith4kids!! Very happy to hear you've made it through the chemo....!!   (just got back from #5 session today myself...metal mouth, yuck!! ...but, only 1 more to go) Kathec, sorry to hear about your node ordeal! But no need to apologize for ranting, if this isn't the place to do so then I don't know where is! As a newbie I am sure to have plenty of rants incoming myself...! I think you should do whatever puts your mind at ease, second opinions or even third opinions are always a good idea if you feel there is something missed. And, there doesn't seem to be a lot of lymph node info out there that I've found any way, including our high risk for lymphedema :(   ...best of luck to you, and keep us posted :)",
