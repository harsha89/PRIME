It's been 3 weeks and I've decided to work part time for now. I also don't have a choice in appt times which really conflicts with my work. I will be going back to work tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. I can't really afford to not work so for now I plan on pushing through! My advice is to go slow. If working full time is to hard try to go part time. Hopefully your employer will work with you. I'm grateful for weekends because the fatigue is brutal for me already. 4 down and 29 to go.

The report recommends scanning in 3 months to see if size changes. I'm terrified of the possibility of lung cancer and just the idea of more treatment is exhausting. I thought I was dealing with bc really well. I haven't cried, been upbeat, and positive. I don't know that I can maintain that attitude much longer especially if I have this sword hanging over my head for 3 months. I have been struggling financially because my job hrs do not work with my treatment schedule, I'm newly engaged to a wonderful man who lives 45 mins away so we do a lot of driving and this is just one more blow to our plans( not that he knows yet). Feeling very overwhelmed ,but grateful I have somewhere I can go to express my fears.",

Your RO is who you need to talk to if this doesn't change. I don't know what your insurance situation is but maybe it would be worth switching facilities? I know that we are our own advocates and that this is a matter of finding out voice and making sure we get the best care we can. You deserve better and I would talk to you RO . I had four treatments before anyone explained the correct procedure for taking a breath in the tube I have to breathe into. Because my cancer is in the left breast I have to have my nose plugged and breathe into a tube so I can move my breast away from my heart when they radiate me. I hold a controller with a button but no one told me that releasing the button allows me to breathe. They told me to press it twice if I needed to talk to them. When I couldn't hold my breathe any longer I popped the tube out of my mouth and the machine was still going. I finally got smart and asked and shocked, they apologized and told me to release the button when I needed to breathe. When I had my weekly appt with my RO she talked with them and they were much more attentive and more through in they're explanations. Asking questions and asking for the care I deserve is something that took me awhile to do. It's odd because I wouldn't hesitate to speak up in my job or relationships. It's all overwhelming and scary and you can't assume the people giving you care are not gonna screw up. Find your voice. You are worth fighting for! As for the disconnect there are three radiation once and only two techs so yes there is a big disconnect which is why oh have to talk to your RO. I hope it gets better for you lots of hugs!  ",

Not everyone has to deal with the sharpest and road maps. I got 3 ratios and they are able to line me up with those. My advice is to use whatever skin cream you choose the first day of rads. I bring it with me and apply it before I put my shirt back on. I used the cream liberally twice a day till I started to get burned then I stepped it up to 3 times and put aquafor on the burn after using my cream. Don't wait to use it put it on the first day it helps! You will find you get fatigued in a different way then chemo. It's much more manageable but it will start quickly if it's to close to your last chemo. I started 2.5 weeks after chemo and my last chemo hit me the hardest. You can also use 100% aloe Vera gel and keep it in the freezer. Callendula cream works best for me and you can get it at whole foods or online. My little nutrition store in kelso washington had it. I think the hardest part for me is the long drive five days a week. It hurts my ability to work hand finances are tight. It does go fast after the first week though. It's odd I have spent the last 8 yrs being a caregiver for people with cancer among other things. I thought I knew what cancer was all about. I really didn't have a clue. This is one life lesson I could have done without. You will get through this though. We all have so much to fight for! Justean I wish I could give you a hug I can't imagine what it's been like for you all these years but you too are a survivor and I hope you find the strength to fight! , We are all here for you no matter what you decide.Stay strong sisters and let's all kick cancers butt!",

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2015 06:05PM - edited Jan 5, 2015 06:08PM by Beachbaby65 Hi old and new warriors, I am 3 wks out of rads and I healed very quickly. The one piece of advice I can give is limit your showering( it dries your skin out and makes it worse) and use lots of your creams. Nothing is too much. I had a bad burn in my armpit the last two wks of rads and every time I showered it would open and start all over, so I finally decided not to shower more than 3xs a week. I just took sponge baths the other days and my skin immediately started healing. It looks awesome now! I had my MO appt to talk tomaxafin and we decided to start efexor first for two weeks as I am getting zero sleep due to hot flashes. If they seem to lessen by two wks then I will start tomaxafin. I have the beginnings of Barrett syndrome from acid re f lux and this has gotten worse since rads so I'm on a higher dose of meds for that too. Tomorrow I will do a chest ct w/ contrast to check on the nodule they saw on my right lung in late October during my SIM. I will be switching insurance and getting married and permanently moving to washington by the end of the month . I didn't want to worry (during my inevitable lapse in medical coverage) about that nodule so he ordered the ct to hopefully put my mind at ease for the next few months. My follow up with RO is right after ct and then hopefully no more doctors, labs, or anything having to do with this damn disease till June and my next mamo. I desperately need to feel normal again and to just be happy. I have the most wonderful man and the best daughters! My baby comes home from her semester abroad(4 months), and I have missed her terribly. I can't wait to see her Friday! I want the fear to go away for awhile and hopefully the ct comes out good and I can rest easy. This is such a damn hard journey we are all on but we're on it together and we can all get through it! The support I find here has saved me in so many ways! Thank you all my sister's new, old, and ones yet to meet! F*ck Cancer!",

No fever just horrible fatigue and stuffy nose and cough. If I wasn't having the left side rib pain and sternum pain I'd chalk it up to a normal cold. Is this just scar tissue pain from roads?

I go to The Phil Knight Cancer Institute in Portland and as much funding that they get you would think they have the latest equipment. They don't. They only have one machine for holding your breath so you have to go to beaverton to get treatment. I was told that if ct they took of my chest during the SIM showed that the area they needed to target was far enough away from my heart, then I wouldn't need to hold my breath.obviously that was not the case. I've done 13 I come in wearing a gown that opens in the back, I lay down, pull my arms out of the gown, put my arms over my head. The techs( sweet ladies thank God) put a clamp on my nose, a mouth piece hooked to a tube hooked to a computer , and a controller with a button in my hand.they expose both breasts line up ratios with machine, then cover me with a warm blanket. Partially covering my right breast but leaving the left exposed. During my SIM we practiced breath holding and determined I could go to 26 sec comfortably so that's what I shoot for. It means it takes two times on each side to get it done sometimes I can go long enough that it's just once on each side. I'm usually done in 3 or 4 mins except on Tuesdays when they take films and I meet with my ro. My last 5 will be boosts and I will get to lay on my side ( no breathing), and they will only target the tumor area at a stronger dose. A little tenderness but no pinkness or skin break down. Calendula cream is awesome. My Appts are late afternoon so I can try to get what hrs ny job can give me that day.

If you, do the amt of time you hold your breath just makes it go quicker or slower. If you can only hold it for say ten seconds then it will just take a little longer. It will still go quick. I hold my breath for an average 20 seconds which means it takes two times for twenty sec each on the right and two on the left. There have been a couple times where I couldn't last 20 and it took 3 times. I've never been in there for more than five or six mins except for the first treatment. Hope50 you and I are even on the number of rads and today it feels like I have a slight sunburn, and there's a bit of itchiness. I do have a lot of tenderness on the outside of my breast and man is my nipple getting sensitive. So far I've not had them use markers on me or a wet towel. It definitely varies depending on where your being treated. ",

They should do it during your simulation . As for the holidays in oregon we won't do treatment on turkey day but we will do it the day before and the day after. I might not be getting my yearly 50% off socks, sheets, and towels on Black Friday. Lol not sure I would have the energy to shop anyway. This is an awesome group and you will fit right in",

No more bras as much as possible which is difficult for a very well endowed girl like me! The techs said this is where you get burned first because of the crease and to expect it to get worse. Yay! I see the RO tomorrow. I have my SIM for my boosts even though they're over ten days away. We will discuss strategies for the burn then , for now lots of calendula and 100% aloe I guess. The fatigue is the same I'm just tired of the long drive. Had a great thanksgiving with my man and my oldest daughter. I miss my youngest but she comes home on the 8th of January from her semester in Germany. I can't wait! The end of this is near and its a good thing as I'm having more episodes of poor me! I hope everyone had a great weekend! I don't know what I'd do without all of you! It's the one place I don't have to put on a good face.",

There is a cream you can get in nutrition stores or online ( amazon has it) by Bolron homeopathic called callendula cream ( not the lotion or gel) it's a natural first aide cream and it has worked really good for me. When I developed a burn under my breast I increased the amt of times I put it on, I also was told to put aquafor on over the cream. My burn healed 75% in less than 72 hrs. I also went without a bra as much as I could.aloe Vera gel that you keep in the freezer will help too just make sure it's 100% aloe. I have had 22 so far also on the left side and also hold my breath 4 Times. Good luck! Have a good weekend.",

Hope it works. I have peeling all under my breast and its quite painful. I have to reapply the antibiotic cream they prescribed me constantly because it rubs off. My nipple is also incredibly painful and not wearing a bra doesn't help. Lol it constantly hard like I took viagra for my nipple! 8 , more to go woo hoo!",

I hope in time you can find some comfort in knowing the incredible impression your dear Cindi had on so many cancer siblings ( the most of which she never met) . I had so much admiration for your wife. Her strength became all of our strength.I send you much love and appreciation for taking the time to write to us. I will think of her in a beautiful garden walking with no pain.",
