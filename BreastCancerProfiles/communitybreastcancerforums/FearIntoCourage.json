I am new to the community (thank you all for being here and I hope this is an okay question to ask): My wife was recently diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer (HR+/HER-2 -/grade 3/no lymph involved). She had a lumpectomy and the next step is choosing a medical oncologist. I am wondering if any of you have recommendations about medical oncologists at Memorial Sloan Kettering (NYC) to work with. We are looking for a doctor who is compassionate, has a good bedside manner, and is comfortable working with a patients who is analytical, asks a lot of questions, and takes an active role in their treatment plan. We also would like a doctor who takes conversations about the benefits versus burdens of particular treatments seriously, and is open to conversations about understanding and weighing potential side effects. We need to have our choices solidified by this Wednesday morning the latest- ideally by Tuesday (sorry for the short turn-around). Any guidance members of the community have would be most appreciated. Thank you!
