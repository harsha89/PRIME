      "Content": "Dec 16, 2007 07:03PM - edited Dec 16, 2007 10:18PM by SuzCA Bimmer, I am with you in sharing your frustration that we are still losing  too many beloved people to this awful group of diseases.  Aids has lost it's almost always fatal consequences as we have been able to stop HIV from advancing.  You are right that more effort needs to be put into figuring out how to stop cancer from getting a foot hold. But for those who do have stage iv, many have benefited from an extended and good quality life through the efforts of their oncologists. Unfortunately none of the drugs currently available stopped or even slowed the type of cancer that invaded your wife's immune system.   I realize are angry and devastated that modern medicine could do so little, but please stop bashing the oncologists. They are there to try to treat the problems presented to them by whatever means available. I had to have proof sent to my Onc before he would see me. Not because he is an SOB, but because he only has enough time to deal with those who truly might be able to benefit from his help. There is no guarantee when you see any physician that they will be able to save your life. Drugs are also funded by the NIH. Drug companies do charge the highest amount that the market will bear.  For profit companies do that.  If a drug is not efficacious it does not usually make it to market in the first place which means the company bleeds money. Millions of dollars and many years of hard work are spent trying to find one that works. We consumers pay for that research when we buy something that makes it to market. If you want  be cynical,  but I can tell you that if a vaccine was discovered for cancer, all types of it, tommorow, and put on the market the day after tomorrow, no one would be put out. The drug companies would just scramble to solve Avian bird flu, obesity, diabetes, or some other ailment. Unfortunately for mankind another ailment will always be around. I don't think it's too optomistic to believe that if a cure were found that we could lift our glasses with research scientists, oncologists, their staff, cancer surgeons, radiologists and even heads of drug companies. All of us are humans, many whose loved ones have been torn from us from by this devastating disease.   That currently we have too little and too late for those we love now is unbearable. I do hope that more research is funded both by drug companies and by government.  So raise your voice, and demand more service.    ",

I trust this guy with my life, literally, so it's very important that I respect him, which I do.      ",
