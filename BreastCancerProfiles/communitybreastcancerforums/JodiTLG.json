She just turned 38 and wants very much to talk to other women under 40 or even 45Â with stage IV mets to bone as she has been on a major rollercoaster since her diagnosis. It would truly help her talk with other young women going through the same treatment and side effects. She lives in Boston and is being treated at the Dana Farber Cancer Center. Can anyone help?
