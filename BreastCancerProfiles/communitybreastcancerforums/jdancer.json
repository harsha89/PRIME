I am now on the second of 4 treatments of Taxol. Nausea is not a problem this time but there is a lot of pain in my legs and knees. They think it may be the Neulasta shot but I had them with the first four and never had a problem. I teach Prek and take a week off and then go back for a week. I hope I make it back this time. I am scheduled to go back tomorrow and my legs are still hurting. It's good to talk to others going through this.",
