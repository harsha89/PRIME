I have one ovary left as had a hysterectomy pre-menopausal and OBGYN left one ovary so I woiuldn't go into immediate menopause. My oncologist recomends I get that ovary taken out- but no rush, just sometime in 2012. I just finished chemo and start rads and Arimedix next month. That was his opinion and I am going with it. Am shooting for May sometime.",
