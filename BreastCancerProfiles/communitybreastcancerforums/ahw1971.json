I went and had a 2nd opinion and she has ordered a Mammaprint and said if it came back as a Low risk, that I would not need to do chemo. I don't know how I feel about not doing chemo if the Mammaprint comes back low risk. Has anyone had their doubts about not doing chemo and has anyone had chemo with a Low risk result? My Breast cancer is Invasive ductal Stage II Er+, Pr+, her2-. Grade 1, 1/5 sentinel nodes positive. Genetic testing was also negative",
