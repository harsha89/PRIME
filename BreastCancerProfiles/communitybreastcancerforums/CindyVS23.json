Margins were not clear on 3/6 sides, and it appears the cancer is \"peppered\" throughput my ducts. I decided on the mastectomy vs further lumpectomy since my breast is small to begin with. It feels like such a whirlwind. So much to read and decide. So many opinions from well-meaning friends. So many things to take care of before I am incapacitated for awhile.

There is light at the end of the tunnel! Got my final saline fill up yesterday. Start PT next week, along with my first visit to oncologist to see about further treatment. I was stage 0, but grade 3 and E+ so should just be some meds. Hang in there all! ",

I am combining that with muscle relaxer and ibuprofen round the clock and it keeps it down to a 5-6 on the pain scale, instead of the 9 I was experiencing before. Increases with activity, sometimes even with the non-affected side. I was also told to lightly massage the area and do the light movement exercises I was given. Seeing a tiny bit of improvement, I can now eat and brush my teeth with my right hand now, but still wake up with more pain than I would like. Starting PT in 2 weeks. Praying that will help...",
