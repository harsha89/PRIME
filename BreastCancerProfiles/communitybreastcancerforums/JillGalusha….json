      "Content": "Mar 16, 2017 09:30AM - edited Mar 16, 2017 09:51AM by JillGalusha Thank you all SO much for your thoughtful replies. I am being treated by Moffitt cancer center in Tampa, Fl - supposedly ranked 6th in the nation in cancer care. My nurse practitioner did tell me that since my initial BRAC testing several years ago, there are new tests available. She gave me the phone number. However, I am concerned that getting an appointment, submitting the blood work and getting the results back (last time it was more than a month) will delay my treatment. I am a nervous wreck as it is. As for PTSD with my sister. It has actually gotten a lot better. I DID go to counseling then. She died about 11 years ago. I am in counseling now so I hope to be able to deal with it in therapy. I was just scared thinking about her traumatic death. Moffitt has a team of doctors who review pathology reports and the entire case and history and collectively make recommendations. I guess I will find out what they recommend during my first visit on the 22nd. Although I am very educated and a researcher by nature, many of the terms in the pathology report were difficult to understand despite attempts to google them multiple times. I can't tell you which words specifically but you know how technical pathology reports can be. My nurse practitioner also told me that the pathology report I have on the biopsies are not the ONLY pathology reports I will get. This makes me wonder if there will be a surgical step after meeting with the surgical oncologist but before the mastectomy. What do you think? I am nervous about any delays as the cancer could spread to the lymph nodes if it hasn't already. One of my reports, mammogram, ultrasound or pathology recommended a MRI. I am pretty set in my decision to have a double mastectomy so I wonder if they will bother with that test. I don't know what a MO doctor is. Can someone explain? I know the doctor will likely recommend Tamoxifen and other drugs due to the status of my receptors. Regardless of the mastectomy, I am certainly willing to do chemo(unlikely and dreaded), radiology, and anti hormone drugs. I have one ovary but am post menopausal ( 56 years old). I know this will affect treatment decisions. I do wonder if they will remove my remaining ovary. What is OncotypeDx? I reviewed every WORD of my pathology and other reports and don't remember seeing that word. Tessa, your experience really relieved my mind. Thank you so much. My breasts are VERY dense and I had silicone implants over the muscle. When I was in Baton Rouge my doctors often had me do mammogram, ultrasound AND MRI but since moving to Tampa, Moffitt hasn't ordered any. I hope this will help convince my doctor that my decision to have double mastectomy is warranted. FYI. Just read on my pathology report that prognostic/predictive factors will be performed. Final results will be in a separate report. I texted my Nurse Practitioner and asked her if this has been done and if I can pick it up. How did you guys get the solid line with your age, diagnosis, treatment and other factors at the bottom of your posting? I would like to put that on all of mine too. All of you have been wonderful and have helped relieve my mind. My mind has always gone to the worst case scenario. Thank you all so much. I hope you can answer some of my questions/issues.",

I don't have a number result (Alfred score fore ER +) and no number result for PR +. My pathology report does not list any genetic tests or genome assay and I don't know why. I have no idea if my cancer is slow growing or fast growing. I know I have very dense breasts and am considered high risk. My last issue is that I just remembered that when I had my hysterectomy in 2004 they left an ovary. I was 44 at that time. Now at age 56 I don't know if the remaining ovary is producing any estrogen/progesterone. I wonder if they will remove the remaining ovary. I am anxiously waiting for my surgical oncologist on the 22. I was told we will be reviewing the pathology report and make recommendations and work with me to determine the best plan. I am set on having a double mastectomy because of my personal history/risk and family risk. I updated my profile. Thank you so much for helping me do this.",

      "Content": "JillGalusha wrote: Hello, I am a newbie and this is my first post. I am in the early stages of this entire process. I had my annual mammogram then an ultrasound then a needle core biopsy. I had 3 needle core biopsies a few years ago - two in right breast and one in left. Fortunately they all came back negative but I was scared to death. This time they found a spot in the right breast. The biopsy results were invasive ductal carcinoma. The size was extremely small at the time of the biopsy - 3mm by 4mm. The cancer grade is 2. I am ER+ PR+ and HER2 IHC negative HER2 ISH not amplified. I have not met with the surgical oncologist yet. My appt is in a week or so, three weeks since diagnosis. Question 1. What do you think will happen on this first doctor visit? ********** I suspect she will recommend a lumpectomy and removal of some lymph nodes and do biopsies on both. Is this true? Second, I am at a higher risk of breast cancer due to family history. My only sister was diagnosed at stage 3 34 years old and died two years later. My mothers sister also had breast cancer. However I am BRAC A AND B negative. Third, I want a double mascetomy plus whatever chemo, radiation, and hormone therapy they recommend. I know you all think this is not a logical decision but I still have PTSD from my sisters entire experience. I begged her to have a double mascetomy right away but she chose lumpectomy but eventually had to have the mastectomy anyway.She died a horrible traumatic death at 36. Question 2: Do you think the surgeon will approve my decision? I am firm in my decision. Question 3. Do you think my insurance (very good) will cover this plus reconstruction if the surgeon recommends lumpectomy? I have several friends who had lumpectomies but the cancer came back. In one case, she had no cancer in her breasts but breast cancer was found on her head. I don't want a lumpectomy. I want to reduce my risk of spreading or reoccurrence to zero. I want a double mascetomy. I would appreciate anyones thoughts on this subject. Log in to post a reply",

I decided to have a double mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy for personal reasons. 6 weeks after surgery I am having severe complications on the right side. This is what happened. April 14 mastectomy. About a week or two after the right side opened up at least 4-5 inches wide and about 1/2 in depth. There was one hole near the center and I don't know how deep it was. I panicked and went to plastic surgeon who said we see this all the time. Don't worry let it air out and it will heal from the inside out. I felt stupid panicking. week or two later woke up with blood all over my nightgown and sheets. Panicked again and saw plastic surgeon who said it was no big deal and he had seen this before and it would heal from the inside out. At this point he wanted me to pack it with moist gauze and cover it. Felt like a dumbass again. A week or two later I was standing in the bathroom when suddenly at least 1/4 to 1/2 cup of clear yellowish drainage came out all over me and pooled on the floor. Panicked again. Saw plastic surgeon and he said that was good and just continue packing it twice a day. I felt like a dumbass again. A week or two later I smelled this horrible smell and thought I needed to take the trash out but when I went to change the dressing I discovered it was my wound that stunk horribly. Panic again. Saw plastic surgeon who said I don't smell anything now. I REALLY felt like a dumbass. Why would I make up something like that? Anyway, he looked at the wound and at first said he would have to go back in and remove the expander because it was exposed. I freaked out. Then the massaged around the perimeter of the wound and suddenly a large amount of drainage spit out over him, me and the floor.He cleaned it up and changed his mind. He didn't think the expander needed to be be removed. Once again he said just pack it with saline soaked gauze and cover it. I never really saw what the wound looked like then. When I got home I saw the wound had opened up all the way and I could see muscle tissue. Again keep packing it twice a day. It has now been six weeks since the surgery and I have a giant gaping deep wound and all I keep getting is pack it twice a day and it will heal from the inside out. I am beginning to question my plastic surgeons judgement> My husband and I got into a fight over this. \"Are you calling the Dr a liar? and do you think you know more than the doctor?\" Several years ago I had a lipoma removed and had to go to a wound care specialist for a couple of months. The treatment was brutal and painful but the wound did finally heal to a point where the doctor could suture it up. I found out that the rule of thumb is that if a wound does not heal on its own after a month the patient should see a wound specialist. If I just continue packing it twice a day I believe it could take at least 9 months to a year to heal on its own. THEN scar revision THEN heal again THEN begin filling expanders. It just doesn't make sense to me that it keeps getting worse but Im told to just let it heal from the inside out. In the meantime, I have resorted to using a female mini pad to absorb the drainage because the large open wound weeps all over my clothes. Does this sound normal to you? Please be honest with me. Should I get a second opinion and go to a wound care specialist and piss of my plastic surgeon or accept that it might take 9 months to a year to heal on its own? I really need your advice. I want to move on with my life. Cant lift more than 5 lbs. Cant swim or fish or do many other day to day activities. Advise me on what I should do.",
