While this site is more than helpful, early on I also found it necessary and helpful to talk with a live person who had gone through this.  Fortunately, I had a colleague at work who was more than willing to discuss her experience with me.  Does your wife have someone to talk to face to face?  I don't know if that will help, but it may.  Good luck through this rollercoaster time.",

I think the \"poorly differentiated\" refers to how much the breast cells have changed due to the cancer.  Grade 1 means little change, grade 2 moderate change, etc.  The \"lymphocytic infiltrate\" may have to do with what they are seeing on your skin.  Do you have any bumps, rashes or lesions anywhere on or close to the site?  That's as much as I can figure out. Make sure you do follow your own protocol because even though it's BC, everyone's is a little different.  Give yourself some space and time.  I hope you have some other family and/or close friends to help you both get through this.  We're always here, too!",

Dh has been off all week and we were expecting a rain storm earlier this week (which we did get, finally!).  So he spend Monday afternoon cleaning the yard, trimming, raking, etc.  The neighbors (yes, the same ones from previous postings) had a bush that they let grow pretty wild.  It had come over the fence and grown practically all the way down to our retaining wall, about 7 feet.  It stuck out almost 2 feet from the wall and spanned about 10-12 feet across.  My dh was concerned about the weight of it on the flimsy wooden trellis and trimmed our side so that only about 3-4 inches was left hanging over.  The next night the storm came and apparently, due to the weight of the bush on the other side, blew it over,.  The following morning (we're at Wednesday now) the man came over and started telling my dh that he had no right to cut the bush, that it was ruined and anyway, he the right to a \"2 foot easement\" onto our property (excuse me?!).  He also likened what my dh did to \"what if I came and cut off the tops of your trees because they are blocking my view?\"  (Again, excuse me?!)  Dh told him it was nonsense and to stake the bush up and it would come back in the spring. So...my dh took the girls for a walk to the store later that morning.  When they came back, the rest of the bush was laying all over our retaining wall and part of the driveway, partially blocking the entrance to the garage.  They were outside on their porch and dh asked the guy, \"Are you going to clean up this mess?\"  He says \"Mess?  What mess?  I don't see anything.\"  The wife chimes in with \"Let him shred it (dh has a machine that mulches) since he like to shred so much.\"  Apparently, this struck my 5 year old funny and she began to giggle.  **If you haven't got the shovels out by now, get ready.**  Then this woman says to my child, \"Shut up, you little brat!\"  In front of my dh and her older sister.  I was shocked when I heard that (good thing I was not home!).  At that point my dh just asked the girls to be quiet, but he was mad.  What kind of a person speaks like that to a child and in front of their parents?!!  If either of them ever speak to either of my children again, I will immediately call the police and say we feel threatened.  This has really been disturbing.  However, my dh is \"get even\" kind of guy and has decided our compost bin needs to be moved...right next to their patio and behind our garage.  Oh well, just wait until the summer when it's 105...I'm having very un-Christian like thoughts about them... ",

Noelle and Otter - I, for one, am particularly glad you are both still here.  I think all of us are.  There is a local commercial for a cancer center that has people saying the phrase \"I found out on the [insert day of choice, i.e., first day of school, day I returned from my honeymoon, day of our family reunion]\" and it makes me think of us at that time.  So, not to be morbid, but I would like to hear what it was like/we were doing when we got \"the news\".  I will post mine soon, but the arm is starting to hurt again.  Probably should do something about that...

Eddie - Got it.  Swish away!  I also like the \"half of the half\" counting as I will be having 2 cocktails also.  So next Thursday will be 50% done for me!  That sounds good. otter - So glad you are feeling well enough to want to bake a cake and eat it!  That's pretty good because it would suck to have to bake one and then not be able/want to taste.  Robin - I hope you are done by now and feeling o.k. still.  Love the poolside chat!  Did the cabana boy come by with your towel?! Randie - I hope you're done as well and that all went well.  Let us know. By the way, when do the two of you go again?  If the everyone who went/is going this week, will let me know their next schedule, I can get all that info to Rock. My achiness became downright painful early this morning.  I'm going to try Alleve tonight and see if that's better.  The ibuprofen is o.k. during the day (if I take 3 of them every 5 hours) but I'm not waking up in the middle of the night for that!  I'm starting to think that 5 months off from work wouldn't be such a bad idea, but nobody knows my job.  It's not because I'm that special, but because our management has never put someone in a position for me to train as a backup.  Phooey.",

The good news - My PET scan was clear!  And the infusion went well today overall.  It will ultimately take less time than the C/C (2 hours instead of 4-5), but today was pretty long because it was the first one.  I am feeling o.k., very little nausea (none as I'm writing this), so I'm hopeful there will be no more of that.  I don't have to go back in the morning for another 2 hours of hydration.  I don't have the IV needle still in my arm for the next day of hydration.  These are all good things.   Now for the not so good news (which is really more like an inconvenience) - My white blood cells did not come up as much after the last round of Carboplatin & Cytoxan, so the nurse says the onc wants to talk to me about my treatment plan.  Crap.  I lean over to dh and (thinking of Boulder the Hairless' weekly plan) said, I bet he'll want me to do a weekly lower dose. So my onc finally comes in and says he wants me to have infusions at a third of the dose (wait for it...) once a week, instead of every 3!  [Pause] Give my my medical degree!!   This will go on for the next 12 weeks.  Which actually extends my total time of chemo to the middle of November, rather than being finished on Oct. 30.  Crap.  Gracie, we will really be chemo buddies!!  I get that the good part is not only will it (hopefully) minimize the WBC issue, but minimize the other potential s/e's.  I get that.  But still... Sooooo...so far, I have had a mild headache, mild achiness and weird tingling sensations in seemingly random parts of my body.  And I'm awake when I should be asleep, thank you steriods.

Otter - That piglet is too cute!!  It's so fuzzy!!  When my oldest dd was about 5, she was climbed up an aluminum fence to see the piglets at the fair.  Well, when she was climbing down, her shoe got caught in between and fell off onto the little piggies!  She was horrified and one of us just reached in and grabbed her shoe.  She still talks about it every summer at the fair.  Randie - Here's to a vicodin coma - Cheers!! Sue - Can I just say, that I love that you always try!!  O.K., I'm not really as bitter as I sound in another paragraph.  But I'm feeling back like when I had the delay before.  Eddie, it's that \"left-out, everyone's moving faster than me\", feeling.  So I was thinking.  The only reason we're cutting back is because of my WBCs being below normal (and not that far below).  I think if they come back up and can stay up for awhile on the one-third doses, I will ask the onc about doing the \"regular strength\" for the last two, which would still let me be done-done on Oct. 30.  For some reason, 6 weeks sounds much better than 12.  I can't imagine why.",

And back to Noelle - Yes, I'm on Neupogen for WBC's (in fact, was up and out by 9:15 this lovely morning for my shot) but the problem is/was it didn't seem to work as well, or I didn't respond as well the after the last round of Carbo/Cytoxan.  Usually, after 7 days of shots and 3 weeks to the next chemo, my numbers have come up into the normal range (low normal, but normal nonetheless).  And this time they didn't.  So I think my onc was fearful of wiping out my entire immune system with the first tx of Taxotere last week, if he gave me the full strength.  Which is why I was thinking we will be monitoring it very closely and if the numbers stabilize, maybe I can finish the last two treatments on time.  Because I'm really not sure I can do weekly for 12 weeks. Karin - We are all glad for school here, too!!  Relish your germy hugs!!! Randie - \"Commando Clean\"?  hehehe.  And your story about your 12 y.o. dd made me tear up.  That is very sweet.  It really got to me, especially because I'm not quite feeling the love here.  I got into it with the 9 y.o., who refused to help me carry more than one bag of groceries in this morning.  Actually, she didn't refuse, she just didn't come back to help when I asked her to.  I was really quite pissed, but I don't think it's entirely for her.  I'll get back to that.  However, I did tell her that it was not asking too much of her to help a bit more, or at least not complain or be difficult when she's asked to help.  Sheesh. Rock - Sometimes I need others to be pissed off for me.  But apparently it's there, because I was quite the queen this morning.  I haven't had a meltdown for awhile, but one's coming.  Something's gonna give, because the plate's getting full again.  Can I just say that yes, even though the se's are better, that it is weekly chemo and if one more person says, well that's not so bad then, I may have to hit them with my shovel!!

Rock - Glad you at least got started.  I understand the fear - even if it's a benign nothing, it's still something.  And my jury service has been fulfilled without even going in! Julie - The \"Naganator\"?!  BWAHAHAHAHA!! Adrinne - Happy Birthday!!! Well, one band concert down and one more to go.  Katie was happy she didn't squeak on her clarinet.  Her band teacher is great - it takes a very special person to teach beginning band in more than one school!",

By the way, sometimes I feel as if I could be the poster child for chemo-brain!  Word-finding has become my nemesis, which is very annoying when you're trying to be the authoritative parent and it comes out as \"Put that thing down and go do that other thing I've told you to do 18 times!\"  Somehow, it loses it's punch.  I want to say more, but it's midnight now and I am a single parent for the next few days as dh went to Southern Cal to help his sister move.  The alarm goes off veeeeeeerrryy early...so I'll just say thanks again.",

I have fantasized about other ways to let him know I know - printing out a full size picture of my choice and leaving it somewhere in the house; placing a packed bag just on the inside of the door.  Today I had others, like \"So, did you just buy a ticket to Vegas for you or did you buy one for BTCH, too?\"  Sorry - I have to stay in angry mode to have the energy to get through this.  Still dreading telling the girls... I will post tomorrow night if I can - I feel the love, girls, I feel the love.  Did I say I have amazing friends who are supporting me? ",

Gracie - Be aware of the swelling that comes with rads, too.  I think I'm still battling it, although it is getting better.  Karin - Can I send you a picture even though you don't have my card...yet?  (Although Jen secretly PM'd the list, so I'm planning on sending everyone cards - soon.) Sue - Thanks! Rock - I PM'd you.  Love the sister thang! By the way, everyone be careful.  I managed to bruise my ribs just jumping with the girls on their new trampoline last week.  And, no, I did NOT fall down!  This was just regular jumping but I think the bruising came from falling on my butt and bouncing back up (didn't know I could do that!) a few times.  So just be careful because I remember reading something about the chemo/rads weakening our bones (Otter - help?!)",

Gracie - If I remember, the boosts were easier on the skin.  I hope it is that way for you, too. Eddie - Your nickname should be \"Cheerleader\"!  You always step in and ground us just at the right time.  I'm going to piggy-back off of you, if you don't mind...I think one thing that has happened is we are all \"hyper-aware\" of our own physical/bodily reactions and of cancer in general.  I don't ever remember being so surrounded by issues of cancer (some bc, some not) prior to my own diagnosis.  I probably was, but tuned it out - it didn't affect me, so much.  Kind of like being pregnant (for those that have been) - you suddenly notice all these pregnant women, small babies, strollers, crying babies, etc. because you are attuned to them.  I'm not saying we should ignore our bodies or our emotions, but I think we are a little (!) more sensitive than we were, say, a year ago.  Personally, I also want to protect myself and hide away (at least in part).  But that won't change anything, either.  At this point, one of the things I'm struggling with is how not to live 3 or 4 months at a time, or from appointment to appointment, or scan to scan, etc.  My friend told me her mother-in-law chose not to have any follow-ups after colon cancer because \"she did not want to live her life one appointment at a time\".  (BTW, she had it twice, 10 years apart, and is still kicking).  I'm too much of a worrier to do that, but I get the sentiment.  I think I'm starting to ramble, but it's about stuff I have been thinking about for awhile.  Or, it could be the drugs...sorry for the long post. ",

Okay...now for a little humor.  Yesterday, I woke up to the two girls in the hallway.  Kelly, the little one, is saying \"I'm gonna show Mom\" and I hear Katie say \"NOOOOOOOOO!!!\"  So, I come out and Katie is hiding Kelly behind her.  \"Just show me - I'm gonna see it anyway.\"  But I was not prepared to see my 5 y.o. with half her hair missing!!!  And I mean HACKED!!  Remember that men's hairstyle in the 80's, with short sides and top and then the long tail in the back?!  Yep.  That's it.  I just stood there and then went \"What did you do?!\"  I calmed down before she cried and we talked about how changing our hair is okay, we just do do it ourselves.  So, I took her into the kitchen and chopped off the tail since we had a birthday party to go to yesterday morning!  Needless to say, the new haircut is cute but it was a bit traumatic getting there!  I will post \"before and after\" pics on FB. Happy Sunday!!",

I have a question for you all - has anyone had a yeast infection right after chemo?  I can't recall that being a side effect, but now I never know.  However, I mentioned it to the doc's office today and his PA called in a prescription for Diflucan, so maybe?  Just curious if this is just me and if I have to be concerned after every tx...",

      "Content": "Jul 13, 2008 03:09PM - edited Jul 13, 2008 03:11PM by drcrisc O.K., the attempt at church failed - we were all not very motivated anyway.  But it gave me time to catch up on the 3 pages - does that count?!  Linda - I know what you mean about \"missing\" this place and these women.  There were many times during my trip last week that I kept thinking \"I gotta remember that one to post\".  I also found myself wondering about Rock's feet and Randie's netherlands (sounds weird!), etc., etc.  One more thing - I was also an adult when I first saw fireflies and was mesmerized by them.  I grew up in Las Vegas (that's a whole 'nother post) and it was tooo hot for them there.  Rock - Love, love, love that poem!!  And so glad you're feet are letting you walk.  What's with Lulu (that's just a goofy name anyway - sorry, that's probably uncalled for) and helping you with a sweatshirt?!  It's a wonder she still has her hands!  Puuhleeze!! Jeano - I think how fast they \"push\" in the meds is related to an increase/decrease of s/e's.  At least that's what my onc told me.  My infusions last 4-5 hours each time (I also have 4 bags of stuff) but they drip the meds sloooooowwwwllllyy.  The last bag of just hydration goes much faster.  Mominaz - Hope your mom is able to really mother you in a good way.  Sorry about the heavy period thing.  Been there, done that and it sucks!  My friend calls it \"the flood\".  I had almost a constant spotting between my first and second txs and had a period during both txs.  No spotting yet - we'll see if I've hit chemopause.  Sable - YAY for you to be done with AC!!  And sorry about the port/sticking thing.  Owie. Randie - Sooo glad to hear things are getting better.  You mentioned your future gd coming which reminded me about your ds - how's he doing? Roxi - Hope things are okay for your sisters.  The only family history of bc is also my aunt on my father's side.  It was over 50 years ago and the only tx she had was a mastectomy.  She is now almost 95!  But I've been thinking about getting tested when this is all done just for my dd's to know (it's not urgent, since they are so little still).  Dana - Sorry for the chemo brain stuff.  That happened to me yesterday in the grocery store.  I could not place a former co-worker (until we left the store) and my oldest dd kept saying (loudly, of course!) \"Who is that?\".  Shush!   And it was you who told me about the yeast-y thing with you (I've had it after each tx) and I remembered to mention it to Randie.  So yay you! Otter - So glad you're feeling well enough to travel again and that it's a good place with warm, loving in-laws!  And cake and ice cream to boot! Sueper - I know you're away, but I just missed your wit (\"dog ass tired\", yup, that about sums it up).  And the \"destination\" is where we decide to have chemo for that week - it started as \"beachy\" places, but now we have become world travelers! Gracie - It took me a couple of readings to realize who \"Auntie Flo\" was and why she was taking you to the store early in the morning - can you say chemo brain?! Eddie - (I've been going backwards - can you tell?  Had to take notes, too!)  WOMAN - Shingles suck!  Postponing chemo sucks too, but I can so relate to that part.  Done that twice.  Feels like such a setback and I am a creature of habit - get me on a schedule and I'm good to go!  I do hope they are getting better - sounds like it.  I also hope you're getting something good to drink to wash down those Ethiopian-size pills!  Ha.  I can also relate to issues under the arm, as I will explain below. Even though we went away, bc seemed to follow.  However, I'm not completely sure if this bc-related, but I can blame it anyway!   A few days before we left, I noticed what looked like either an in-grown hair or a pimple (?), yes, you guessed it - under my arm!!  And it happens to be the lumpectomy/node removal arm.  Great.  I wasn't too worried about it and sprayed/slathered it with antibiotic cream for several days.  Seemed to be better, but noooooo.  Tuesday afternoon it was huge, red and clearly infected!  Fortunately, my mom travels with the kitchen sink and, lo and behold, produces a bottle of Amoxicillan.  My RN dh says take them.  So I took one that evening and the next morning called my onc's office to talk to the PA.  She agreed - take them and sit with a warm compress under my arm (yeah, that will work well traipsing through Disneyland!).  She laughed when she heard that.  Unfortunately, she only had 4 full days worth, so I will be calling tomorrow morning for a follow-up.  I DO NOT want to postpone tx again for this. The funny part (Slight TMI):  When I raised my arm while naked, it looked I had 3 nipples!  Sorry to those who have lost one or two - I would gladly share!  lol... The annoying part:  Before it got better, it got worse and hurt like hell.  It didn't help that I brought my backpack/purse (to make things easy to carry) and the strap hit in just that spot.  Damn.  (That's for you, Eddie). The scary part:  Even thought it seems to have responded well to the antibiotic, anything weiredness on that side is disconcerting.  Crap.  So, if it's clear and my counts are still fine, I will have tx #3 on Thursday.  One more of this cocktail and then it's on to Taxotere.  The HFS is making me nervous, given my daily hike into/out of work.  We'll see... Sorry for the long post, but I'm caught up now!",

Didn't have any energy left last night after taking the kids and grandparents to the fair.  Little dd performed with her dance class and we ate badly and watched the kids ride some rides.  Fun, but tiring and at least it was not hot.  It is usually in the 100's during fair time.  I had gelato, apparently in a mind-meld support of going to Italy this week.  Can we go next week, too?  I've always wanted to go and plan to still!  So, this is the list as I wrote it down while I caught up (a little late, but...): Wednesday - Gracie (FEC #4); Rock (T#? and hopefully back to DD); Adrienne (T #3); Jean (T #2); and the winner is... Karin (T/C - ALL DONE!!! YAAAY!) Thursday - Randie (T #1 - Good luck!!); Angels (T #2); Linda (T #3)  It's interesting to see that most of us are on one of the taxanes at this point.  I think Gracie and I are the late bloomers (we'll finish together!).  Sue - I can't remember what you are on and which one (#) it is.  I have one more C/C next week.  With different antinausea meds...Here's a \"chemoooo\" for the Wednesday group!",

(It's a bit long, but I had to share) A young wife sat on a sofa on a hot humid day, drinking iced tea and visiting with her Mother. As they talked about life, about marriage, about the responsibilities of life and the obligations of Adulthood, the mother clinked the ice cubes in her glass thoughtfullyand turned a clear, sober glance upon her daughter. 'Don't forget your Sisters,' she advised, swirling the tea leaves to the bottom of her glass. 'They'll be more important as you get older. No matter how much you love your husband, no matter how much you love the children you may have, you are still going to need Sisters. Remember to go places with them now and then; do things with them.'  'Remember that 'Sisters' means ALL the women... Your girlfriends, your daughters, and all your other women relatives too. 'You'll need other women. Women always do.' What a funny piece of advice!' the young woman thought. Haven't I just gotten married? Haven't I just joined the couple-world? I'm now a married woman, for goodness sake! A grownup! Surely my husband and the family we may start will be all I need to make my life worthwhile!' But she listened to her Mother. She kept contact with her Sisters and made more women friends each year. As the years tumbled by, one after another, she gradually came to understand that her Mom really knew what she was talking about. As time and nature work their changes and their mysteries upon a woman, sisters are the mainstays of her life. THIS SAYS IT ALL: Time passes. Life happens. Distance separates. Children grow up. Jobs come and go. Love waxes and wanes. Men don't do what they're supposed to do. Hearts break. Parents die. Colleagues forget favors. Careers end. BUT......... Sisters are there, no matter how much time and how many miles are between you. A girl friend is never farther away than needing her can reach.  When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you have to walk it by yourself, the women in your life will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on, praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the valley's' end.  Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk beside you...or come in and carry you out. Girlfriends, daughters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, mothers, grandmothers, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended family, all bless our life! The world wouldn't be the same without women, and neither would I. When we began this adventure called Womanhood, we had no idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other. Every day, we need each other still.",

Speaking of avatars, Rock, I was also curious about you new one.  Glad to hear it is just a reflection of how you feel and that you haven't become radioactive. Randie - You tell those doctors to take care of your baby or we might have to visit them with our own army!  Lee - Just go in your bedroom and close the door.  That should send a message that you are \"unavailable\" to anyone.  Sheesh. Linda - Thanks for update on the \"Taxotere only\" stuff.  I am heading in that direction (eventually).  I can't remember who's up for next week, except Kristy and me (maybe?!) on Thursday.  Oh, I found a note, Sable's on Thursday also.  I can try to keep track again, if folks want to update me.  However, my dh is on vacation all week and monopolizes our computer when he's home.  Actually, he has a good excuse as he's taking some online courses.  But, I usually have it to myself in the evenings as he works a swing shift.  So my point is, I may be a little behind but will be glad to track dates anyway.",

Roxi - I did see Sharon's post.  And glad to hear your feeling great - hope it continues!  Eddie - I have heard that a lint roller is \"kinder\" than the duct tape. I guess being at home won't be so bad, except that the last day of school is tomorrow.  Aaacckk.  I banished the little dd (who sleeps with me every night) to Grandma's tonight.  \"Whhyyy?\"  \"Because mama isn't feeling well.\"  \"Ooookaaay.\"  So far, the neuopogen is hardly noticeable.  Except the injection site is still sore.  Does anyone else miss Rock?   Alright, I'm rambling - Good night.",

When I talked to my mom today, she said she missed us.  And I said not as much as we miss you!   Whew!  These girls of mine are a handful.  Separately, they are fairly easy, but together...Yikes!  Noelle - So I am sadly lacking in the exfoiliating department.  And it's only my face, although I do have a body scrub I use occassionally.  Like Roxi, I want to know about Bath & Body stuff.  We all use it.  Any good?  Jen - Hope your older sis comes through.  I know I've been missing mine terribly through this.  Ironically, this is the first year we have lived across the country from each other (she's in Maryland right now).  Glad the wig people are getting their due.  And really glad you had a great b-day.  Good news - The women's Olympic gymnastics team is coming to San Jose next month and I'm taking my dd to see them!  We splurged and got tickets on the floor.  I'm just as excited as she is!!!!  I will be taking her by myself, so I have to feel good.  O.K., Taxotere, we need some cooperation here. And now, bad news - This week I just heard of two people with serious cancers.  My graduate school roommate's brother has an as-yet undiagnosed primary cancer, but mets to his spine.  He went in to the hospital because of back pain.  Shit.  And the husband of someone I know farily well at work has just been diagnosed with liver cancer.  He is young (early 40's?) and they just got married less than a year ago.  She is pregnant and due in Sept/Oct.  Fuck.  Boy, Noelle, there's some people for that guy's study but I don't think they can afford it.  I really hope this Stand Up To Cancer thing is as good as it reads.  They plan on using the money to fund research and I hope that engineer gets some! Sorry for the looooonngg post (and I can't even claim steriods as an excuse!)",

So, just to add to the mix, I was born in Las Vegas.  Yep, hot, dusty, windy, slot--pulling, card-hustlin' Vegas!  It amuses me, because most people find this more interesting than my job!  The most frequently asked question:  \"What was it like to grow up in Vegas?\"  My answer:  \"I can't really tell you because I didn't grow up anywhere else.\"  My dad was musical conductor at the now Bally's (original MGM) hotel and conducted one of the only shows of it's kind left on the strip \"Jubilee!\"  My mom was in a show for awhile (not as a nekked showgirl) but as a singer.  When I was 5, she quit that completely and started teaching singing in our home.  She taught mostly the \"boy\" dancers and then developed a specialty for teaching young children.  Ironically, my older dd, who has a very nice voice, will not take a voice lesson from Grandma to save her life!  It was actually a great time to grow up there and I got to meet some really legendary people like Sammy Davis, Jr., Glen Campbell, the Smothers Brothers (I'm showing my age, aren't I?) and Ziegfried and Roy.  They actually started as a small act in one of the production shows and my dad knew all their \"secrets\" (because of the music) but he never told us! My...I don't know where all that just came from!  Apparently, I am on a reminiscing roll!  I didn't get any more meds, but the nausea did get better today.  I'll probably drag myself into work tomorrow and come home dog ass tired (that was for you, Sue)!  Roxi - I can't help you directly with your question, but I'm sure someone can.  I would say search the surgery boards or maybe post your question there.  I think there's also a section just for reconstruction - they might have some good answers.  I hope you find what you need... We didn't take roll call for this week, so I'm wondering who's up?  I know Eddie and Kristy (both Thursday?) but that's all I can remember right now.  Holla if you're bellying up this week!",

Roxi - Good luck tomorrow.  Do we know who else is on deck with you?  I have lost track.  I know there's several of us scheduled for the 19th.  Otter - So glad to hear this one is better for you (I'm knocking on wood right now).  One tip about the wig thing:  I think just about any hairdresser will style it for you, so if it has too much hair, you can get it cut.  I have to finish clearing out the whirlwind, but just wanted to check in.  I'll check back later...",

Gracie - Let's hear it for the Keflex club!  Woo-hoo!! Angels - So sorry about your (and Linda's!) Taxotere woes - I'm two txs behind you!  Eddie - \"LOSE a turn\"!!  Yes!!  I know exactly what you mean - I felt that way the week my platelets were off and we had to \"reschedule\".  I pick up my counts tomorrow, so I'll know if it's a go before Thursday.  Sue - Never been to Montana, but I have a childhood friend who lives there.  Sounds perfectly lovely...and it's been in the upper 90's here, too.  And so happy to see your face again!  I know it's more than just you and me on Thursday, but I was bad this week and didn't get a list out.  I'll try next time.  Ellenoire - Marvelous poem!  Have you (or anyone) ever read the book \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\"?  It is a children's book, but I used to read it in college.  Maybe sometime we can go to Austrailia (if you've read the book, you know what that means.  If you haven't, I'll explain later.).  Besides, it is very appropriate for chemo.  So, I changed my avatar, but it's so tiny you can't see them very well.  It's my 2 dd's and Mickey.  I haven't had time to figure out the Photobucket thing, and my dh is taking the computer in tomorrow for a \"tune up\".  I will try to check in tomorrow while I'm at work, but that's been kinda dicey lately.  So for those traveling to the bar tomorrow, in the Italian tradition, salud!",

My last great act before crashing for an hour and a half nap yesterday was to go and rent her a clarinet for band.  Mind you, she has never been in a band before or played anything more than the recorder.  But she managed to make some sounds come out of the clarinet and they weren't all bad.  We did have a good laugh about some of them, though.  Today, I took a shower.  And then I was tired.  I think the last 2 days of going when I'm usually down after chemo finally caught up with me.  It took all day to 1) shower; 2) find pictures of the little one for her to take to school because she's the \"Superstar\" (Sue!!) this week and, 3) cut the rest of her enormous birthday cake into cupcake size for her to share with her classmates tomorrow.  And what is it about chemo that just makes our brains not work?!  For the life of me, I could not figure out how to cover these things without either making them fall over or scraping all the frosting off!  And no 5 y.o. will want one with scraped off frosting!  Okay, I'm rambling and I'm not on steriods...really glad to hear some of you having good weekends.  It is deserved by all.  I know that's generic, but that's the best I can do tonight.  It is a whole different animal to have kids in school and having chemo.  It was a lot easier during the summer.  Sigh.   G'Night.",

Eddie - Hope you had a good day at your friend's house.  I found one about \"taking responsibility\" for you.  It just sort of clicked when you talked about feeling in control (which often we feel so much out of).  I guess I'm having a Zen sort of weekend... \"Taking responsibility for my own life is empowering.  I know I can never be defeated by circumstances, nor will I ever allow myself to by manipulated.  In partnership with God, I take divine ideas and apply them in my everyday life.  As a thinker, speaker, and doer of the highest and best intentions, I am a dynamic enthusiastic participant in life.  Divine ideas flow to me and through my plans and actions.  Each day I reflect on my contributions toward my own well-being and the well-being of the people who are sharing my life.  Accepting the gift of life, I give thanks for it and live it in fullness.\"",

Gracie - Thanks for reminding me as I think I'm really having chemopause.  I have deduced this mostly because I'm \"late\" and since giving birth to the littler one, I have not been \"late\".  28 days.  Exactly.  And now I'm about 4 days late.  Yup.  Chemopause.  I cannot wait for that first hotflash...

Eddie - Triple neg just means that we are not hormone positive at all and are also not HER2+.  This are both good and bad as far as treatment goes.  It is good because of the non-aggressivity of the HER2, however, my research has shown that triple negs can sometimes be aggressive in their own way.  So I'm not sure about that.  Triple negs (if I'm remembering right - Otter, correct me if you know differently) seem to hit younger women and younger women tend to have more aggressive tumors.  The bad part is, like I said before, there are no targeted after-chemo treatments, like Herceptin and/or the hormone meds.  So chemo and rads are it for us.  I haven't looked into risk for recurrence or anything like that - I'm just not up to it yet.  I know there are a couple  of other triple negs on here - feel free to chime in with what you know! So...I've spend about 2 hours this morning researching a hotel for next month.  Did I tell you all that I got tickets to take my 9 y.o. to see the women's Olympic gymnastics team?  They're coming to San Jose (about 3 hours from here) next month and I'm trying to find a hotel that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to the arena they are performing in.  I'm still in my pjs and they are starting to get restless now...

We were driving in the right lane when suddenly a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, skidded, and missed the other car by just inches! The driver of the other car whipped his head around and started yelling at us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean, he was really friendly. So I asked, \"Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!\" This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call, \"The Law of the Garbage Truck.\" He explained that many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on you. Don't take it personally.. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets. The bottom line is that successful people do not let garbage trucks take over their day. Life's too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so..... \"Love the people who treat you right. Pray for the ones who don't.\" Life is ten percent what you make it and ninety percent how you take it! Author Unknown",

My brother just lost his wife.  I'm not sure what I feel right now except sympathy for him and her 14 y.o. son.  It was both sudden and not.  She was apparently a very heavy drinker and most of her major organs just stopped working. They live in Las Vegas, and I have met her maybe 3-4 times, so I'm putting some stuff together.  She was hospitalized about a week ago after she began vomiting uncontrollably.  They knew very early on that her liver was failing and her kidneys had failed (she would have needed dialysis).  The funeral will be Friday or Saturday and obviously my mom must go.  I feel very bad that I can't go, and mostly just because I can't travel with my mom as I know that it's stressful for her to travel by herself.  And even though when the two of us are together, it is not always stress-free for me, I would have gone nonetheless.  I'm not really feeling the need to grieve (although I know this could hit me in a very different way and when I least expect it) as I truly didn't know her that well.  My brother left his first wife for her (I still think of his first as my sister-in-law - she has been incredibly supportive of me) and did it badly, so it was hard to welcome her into the family.  The one and only time they visited us at Christmas several years ago, she, and my brother, drank almost continuously and it was rather off-putting.  As I write this, I find mysefl feeling rather angry at the waste of a life (she was in her early 50's) when there are so many here who are fighting for a second or even third chance (Alaska Deb comes to mind).  And I feel very bad for her son, who is in the not-so-capable hands of my brother.  I love my brother, but a good father he is not.  Especially of a teenage boy who is at a crossroads in his life.  Sigh.  My family seems to do major things in three's (maybe there's an Italian thing about the number 3, Eddie).  Ten years ago we lost 3 family members suddenly and within a year of each other.  Crap.  Now I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop - I think of how many times my sister has, and will, fly across the country over the past and next year.  I think of my mom and the stress my illness/treatment is on her.  Crap, crap, crap.  Okay, I didn't know all this was in there, but thanks for letting me get some of it out. ",

I did not have treatment today.  Last night I was the b*tch from hell on wheels - depressed, anxious, and mostly, in pain.  Went this afternoon to my infusion and told them about my pain, and especially the burning feet thing.  Everyone said \"Neuropathy!\"  And they fetched my onc.  He came out and asked me again about my symptoms and then asked (because he did not have my chart in front of him) how many txs with Taxotere I have had.  \"One and at a third of the dosage.\"  Oh.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.  He asks me how many nodes were positive.  \"None.\" More thinking, thinking, thinking.  Then he says \"I can't give you any more Taxotere without the neuropathy getting worse.\"  Bottom line is - the reaction I was having (or so I gathered) was quite unusual for the dose I got and they were worried my neuropathy would become irreversible at some point.  So no more Taxotere for me!  I am having 2 more rounds of tx with my \"old\" friends, Carboplatin and Cytoxan.  Most of me is really glad (because I was really hating this), but there is a tiny bit that is concerned about making the right decision (Roxi, I hear you on tough decisions) and forgoing the Tax as it is one of the better txs for triple neg.  Sigh.  I am going to keep telling myself that six rounds of 2 meds is okay and better than a lifetime of neuropathy.  And I still have to do rads.  That was always in my future.  Now my last chemo will be October 2!!  Yee haw!!!!",

On Monday afternoon, dh states that he has a scratchy throat and by Tuesday morning, it's so sore that he can't talk.  He spent all day in bed and on Wednesday went to the doctor and found out he had bronchitis!!  Even more terrific.  So the girls and I spent the week at my mom's.  Katie is prone to pneumonia and I didn't want her exposed, and I couldn't be exposed for obvious reasons.  He is better now, by the way.    So, we got through all that and yesterday, I dropped my mom off at her church as she was going on a weekend retreat with the ladies to Santa Cruz.  About an hour later, she called me and told me that my brother (not the one who lost his wife last month), had been scheduled for an angioplasty yesterday morning, but was now being kept in the hospital over the weekend and is having bypass surgery on Monday (Sept. 22).  When I talked to him later that day, he told me one artery is completely blocked and the other is 80% blocked.  Sigh.  So I drove to King City, about 40 miles from us, where the ladies had dropped my mom off and brought her back home.  She is now on her way to Las Vegas to be with my brother and sister-in-law.  Please pray the surgery goes well and that my sister-in-law can handle the stress.  She has had her own medical issues for several years and is rather frail herself. Since my mom is my primary caretaker of my girls during the week, it is always stressful and hectic when she is gone.  Not to mention, I'm rather worried about my brother.  Up until about 6 weeks ago, his primary diet was meat and beer.  However, to his credit he changed that dramatically when he didn't pass his stress test.  But you can't undo 35 years of eating that way in 6 weeks.  Other than that, he's in fairly good health (no chronic conditions), so I think he'll make it through, but it is major surgery and that's always scary.  Sorry I'm not commenting like usual on everyone - I just don't have it in me today.  I did read everything and missed you all on the days I couldn't check in.",

Jean - I'm not sure what I missed (haven't been to FB yet, maybe it's there), but I hope you're feeling better, too.  I have asthma, so I also get the \"fish on the dock\" analogy. Roxi - I guess I need to say Happy Birthday!  Kerry - It took me several minutes and more than one read to realize you sleeping cat comment was not about me.  Duh! I am in the midst of deciding whether or not to make a job change.  There's way too many details to explain, but political agendas and bureaucratic policies should sum it up.  Part of my decision is also factoring in my health.  My stress level at my present job is waaaaayy too high, and given what felt like the sudden onset of my lump last year, I just can't allow myself to continue to do \"business as usual\".  By the way, it's not the inmates.  Sigh...I will miss my students. So...on a completely different note, here's what my 5 y.o. said to me last night regarding the death of her bird, Pickle, who is now buried in our backyard.  \"I think on Friday I'll go out and see Pickle.\"  I say, \"Okay, sure, you can visit the spot where he is.\"  She says, \"No, I want to see him.\"  I say, \"Ooohhhh (as it dawns on me that she is serious), no, honey, we're not going to dig up the bird.  But you can stand next to his little cross and talk to him.\"  She says, \"Okay.\"  Oh, to be 5 again (not really!), I just like the innocence of it. Off to FB!",

Jen - Speaking of sleeve and slipping, that's the main reason I took it off Thursday.  It kept slipping and annoying the heck out of me.  But yesterday, I had dh help me pull it all the way up and my LE therapist showed me that because the cuff on my sleeve is not too tight, I can fold it over once at the top.  This helped a lot and it didn't slip hardly at all yesterday.  I wore it much longer than Thursday.  Maybe you can ask about that since I think it depends on your sleeve - it definitely should not slip.  She didn't show me massage but we did go through a number of stretching exercises.  And let us know the results of the scan!

Like Linda, I am bit ambivalent, mostly because 1) I didn't have a mammogram unitl after I felt the lump; and, 2) I fall into the \"dense breasts\" category and have been told by bs and rad onc that a mammogram would probably have not picked it up.  (My lump was in the 12 o'clock position and easily palpable by all but not visible in the mammo, even when we knew exactly where to look.)   So...on the other hand, I know they have played a major role for others and early detection (whether early in age or early in diagnosis).  I read somewhere in this controversy that others are suggesting replacing the mammos with something else that works better (e.g., ultrasound).  I had both and the ultrasound was much better at \"seeing\" my lump.  However, maybe until there is a better screeing process with better tools, the current guidelines should not be changed.  So there it is...

I'm feeling better, but it is so slow.  Two steps forward one day, one step back the next.  I'm beginning to believe it was THE flu, and not just a random flu just because it has been well over 2 weeks now.  On a good note, Katie had her final competition for this season which she was not going to compete in as of one month ago.  However, she asked both me and her coach about 3 weeks ago and we felt it was a good sign she was asking.  And she did really well - brought all her event scores up across the board and finally hit the 32 all-around score.  She took 2nd on beam and 3rd overall - whoo hoo!!  I will try to post pics and/or videos on FB!",

Robin - Hope things are coming along for you, too. I get to see my rad onc twice in the next 2 months.  Last fall I was supposed to get a right-side only mammo, but somehow I spaced it.  Or maybe it was the tooth thing, a PET scan and Life that got in the way.  Oh well.  So I see him Tuesday, sans mammo results, mostly because I had the appointment already made but partly because the girl on the phone asked me if I had seen anyone in the last 6 months.  I guess my off-guard \"Ummm\" gave me away.  I couldn't be mad.  I know I should be seen every six months or so, still it's hard.  I've found if I get bugged a little bit, I'll follow through with making an appointment, etc.  But left to my own devices, well, that's another story. Hugs to all!",

So...that being said, shovels out, girls!!  I have cycled out from sadness into anger again.  Katie told me tonight that her dad told her this (meaning \"divorce\") would have happened anyway, just later.  I am so PISSED!!  How dare he try to minimize his actions and add insult to injury!!  Oooooohhhh... He knows that I feel very, very strongly about this type of violation and it is NOT okay to communicate that message to my daughter.  However, I am trying to not communicate my anger to her, either.  I think, if I keep raising her the way I intend to, she will find her own anger towards her dad in this and so I don't want to foist mine onto her.  So, as calmly as I could, I sat down and reiterated to her that \"cheating\" while you are married or in a relationship at all, is not an okay choice.  I keep saying it that way, \"Dad made a bad choice\" but I just really want to call him an asshole!!  I also had to repress the urge to pack every suitcase we had tonight and leave.  Please send \"good house thoughts\" to us - I have agreed to find a new house (my choice - don't want this one, never have) for me and the girls, and the sooner I find one, the sooner we are out of here!  But I need to play nice for awhile in order to get what I want which includes avoiding a big, ugly legal battle.  So thansk for holding my anger.  I will speak to him about this but I need to wait until the seething stops...

I don't know what to think about the nausea part - I had mild queasiness when I was pregnant but get bad car/air sick!    Guess I won't know until it happens...

Sue - It's really good to see you!  Retirement looks good on you!! Otter - The vacation sounds fun, but not the LE junk.  Speaking of which, I have a fitting for my compression sleeve tomorrow.  I'm anxious about the idea of having to wear it to work.  I think I did a reasonably good job of keeping my health issues away from the inmates, but not if I come in wearing that!  Okay, I've been chatty today.  Unfortunately, I have to get up when the girls do, so time to go.  Happy Tuesday!",

Kerry - I have several poetry books that are just T. S. Eliot.  English was my minor.  When I feel \"stuck\" in some life situation, the line I always hear is \"Shall I part my hair behind?  Do I dare to eat a peach?\"  Felt that way a lot last year.  This weekend, Katie and I caught up a gymnastics scrapbook we started early last summer.  It felt good to do that with her!  She took it to practice today to show it off - and we found some special awards we thought had been lost.  Apparently, I put them between the pages to keep them safe - duh!!",

I'm feeling down because the situation is very bleak for the state of California.  There was a vote yesterday on some propositions to relieve some of the cuts/budget deficit by borrowing money from already-designated areas that can't be touched without voter approval.  They all failed and this means a great deal more cuts, to education in particular, but many, many programs.  I think people see the word \"tax\" right now and want nothing to do with it.  But it's frustrating because if they actually READ what it was about, they would understand.  Sorry for the rant - just feeling the anxiety of the teachers and schools. ",

Okay...neighbors (although I really hate to call them that - they are just people who happen to live next to us).  I walked out yesterday morning to get the girls into the car for school and the B came out on her back porch asking me to keep Kelly from teasing her dog.  I responded that I could, if I thought she was teasing the dog.  (First, Kelly doesn't even know they have a dog; second, she is much more into the cats who visit us which is what she was doing at the time, and third, there is a large, intact wooden fence that separates our yards.)  B began to yell and I just yelled louder for her to \"Shut up!\"  She continued with several expletives thrown in and by this time Katie had come outside.  I hurried them into the car with another \"Shut up!\" As we pulled out of the driveway, I told dh what happened and he yelled colorfully at them to leave our kids alone.  So he called me later that morning at work to say he just met with a police officer because she called them and said he threatened her with bodily harm.  She was also afraid for her dog!!  Are you kidding me??  So now there's a police report (they call it \"unfounded\", like a \"he said, she said\" thing), but still.  After dh called, I was mentally undone.  Couldn't eat, barely able to concentrate.  There has been no contact since then, but if their pattern holds, it will be that way for 3-4 months until some unpredictable trigger happens.  This is the kind of stress I don't need.  Which is also why I didn't tell my mother about it, although I'm surprised the girls didn't tell her.  Okay, I'm starting to ramble here, but other than move, I'm not sure what else to do.  Maybe they'll go instead...thanks for listening.",

Julie - Oh my...fifth grade.  I know it well - although I am beginning to believe that I would not make it on the show.  We haven't had book report issues (that was soooo fourth grade) but part of Katie's weekly homework is writing daily reading logs.  They only have to be 3-4 sentences on a 20 minute reading assignment.  So, I have been reading \"Farmer Boy\" (remember Laura Ingalls Wilder?) to her and her sister.  Besides her acting like she must shove toothpicks under her nails as opposed to writing 3 sentences, it often sounds like this:  \"They planted stuff and then later they picked it.  You know, potatoes, carrots, turnips, that stuff.  It was getting cold.\"  Riiiigghhtt.  Somehow, she is still doing well.  Rock - On the topic of (graduate) students and writing, I actually had someone submit a cover letter this year using the word \"sight\" inappropriately - more than once.  As in, \"I would like to apply to your internship sight.\"  No.  I think not. Otter - You are coping, my friend.  How else could you write such side-splitting posts as \"10 things I've learned\" and, by the way, could you send me some of the virtual valium?  Thanks. And on the general topic of \"getting it together\" - there's a thread somewhere with that title.  When I first joined bco, that was one of the first threads I found and it was mainly women in our position, one to two years out from dx and treatment.  I stopped reading it because it was frustrating to me - I didn't get their issue of not being able to just \"organize a glass of water\" (thanks Rock, loved that one!).  But I get it now...oh, I so get it now.  As I'm still catching up from being away all last weekend - down to LA to see my sister and BIL, then to UCLA to watch their women's gymnastics team compete against Stanford (hugely fun!! Wish we lived closer for season tickets...) and the girls and I stayed at the Beverly Hilton Valentine's night.  Next morning when we came down to check out, we walked - literally - into a red carpet event.  Apparently, the Hilton annually hosts the Oscar-nominee luncheon.  And since it was 11:30 when we were checking out, everyone was starting to arrive.  While we did see a couple of people (namely Lee Daniels and Vera Farmiga), we had to leave before the big names showed up.  Still...very exciting. Besides all that, there is just STUFF going on.  No, not with the neighbors - just other STUFF.  Until I am reasonably sure of the direction I'm going take, I don't want to put it out here just yet - and no, it's not my health.  At least not my physical health.  Sorry to be cryptic, but little eyes tend to come in unexpectedly, so until they know, I can't say.  But just send some hugs here, okay?",

Ironically, it was probably one of the best, most mature conversations about our relationship we've had in 10 years.  Unfortunately, a bit late in the game.  Somehow, it was gratifying to know that I was right on so many levels - about the earlier nature of their relationship as teenagers, about his feelings towards me and the girls and that he really just wants to move on.  There was no nastiness (after the first 10 minutes) on either of our parts and I am grateful for that. I've lost a lot of the anger (I don't think it's entirely gone, just packed away until I don't need it anymore) which is better for me all around.  We're going together to meet with the attorney tomorrow to see how we should work things out.  We're telling the girls together on Saturday - and he's taking responsibility for being in love with someone else.  Then we're putting the house on the market, which is actually something we've talked about on and off over the past year, so that shouldn't be too much of a shock for them.  However, when I think about the idea of moving (even though I could never continue to live here), I do get overwhelmed as I look around.  So...one step at a time and try to keep remembering to breathe.  I don't think I've said this part yet here - it would be much harder if I were still \"in love\" with him.  But I'm not.  Other events and a shifting of priorites for me has changed that over the years.  I care for him (and he still cares for me) but we shouldn't be married anymore.  This is just the external event that pushed us in the direction we were already slowly going.  So while I am upset, I am not devastated.  As always, my main concern is for the girls and helping them to adjust. My friends - you all can't know how much I have mentally \"leaned\" on you this past week!  I am ever so grateful for you and our friendship... Hugs to you all!!",

Apparently, the police can't do anything about it because the signs are inside their windows which is considered \"personal property\".  I suppose if there was profanity, direct threats or something, they could.  It was funny at first, but now it's not.  <Sigh> I'll try to get on FB this weekend - I'd like to post some pics from my mom's 80th birthday party last weekend!  Here's hoping for some rest and regrouping this weekend...",

The man I am married to is having an affair.  (can't say dh anymore).  I have absolute proof in the form of emails and pictures (Yes, I did say PICTURES!!!  On my computer!!!).  To back track a bit, odd behaviors began happening about 2 months ago and got really weird the day after we came home from the fabulous weekend.  There was a suspicious phone call that he tried to play off as from \"work\" (his work rarely calls him at home and he is a bad liar).  One of the worst parts is, he told Katie, after she found a new cell phone in his car no one was supposed to know about, also to lie to me.  However, she told her grandma, who mentioned it to my sister and then it came to me after I told my sister about the weird phone call.  So I started digging while he was at work in the evenings and found too much stuff.  I also know that she was here while we were gone last weekend.  I know who she is - she lives in southern California and they have known each other for years.  Sometime before Christmas, he joined FB and I think that's when things started heating up.  Ironically, she used to be my \"friend\" on FB at least until late December.  Since I don't go on too often, I didn't notice she had \"unfriended\" me until I checked last week - is this a fucking soap opera or what?!?!? I have amazing friends who are supporting me here and will help with the kids.  My sister is coming this week to help my mom and also when I confront him, as I haven't done that yet.  (And let me just say, it's been a looooonngg damn weekend!)  I just got surefire proof this morning, almost by accident but probably not, since I actually prayed for something definitive so I could move in the direction I need to go.  Made copies of very important info, including financials, tonight. Right now, I am relatively calm - thank goodness I still have some Xanax or there would be no sleep!  I am feeling many things, but very, very angry when I think about the effect this will have on the girls.  Found an email that he saved (he's really bad at this!) where she said she's feels bad (she should) and that she's a homewrecker (yes!), as if he is guilt-less!!  Stupid bitch can have him - I'm DONE.  So that's my STUFF.  I think Katie suspects something is up - the vibe in the house has been truly weird.  Thankfully, Kelly is the type of child who is truly, blessedly oblivious but she will also be the one to miss him the most (bastard!) and I am dreading telling them.  Thanks for the hugs, my friends - just keep the three of us circled...",

Otter - Thanks for all the info!  You're great!  cstock39 - No one but you will know if you've made the right decision.  But there is a lot of information here and online in general and there is a lot of support here, too.  From what I have read, if the margins in your surgery were clear and there are no other lumps, then breast conservation (or lumpectomy) is a good choice.  I know there are many reasons one might still choose to have a mastectomy, but it's your body.  Also, I remember when I first was told I would need chemo and it was not when I was first diagnosed.  I felt like I had \"bomb\" dropped on me and then realized that they can't always tell you everything until they (the docs) know as well.  Generally, they need information from your biopsies to determine if you will need chemo and what type/for how long, etc.  It is a lot to take in, but you will.  We all become cancer experts before it's over!  Keep reading, keep posting and know we are here to support you.",

That was a much needed very special time with her.  Otter - thanks for weighing in on my dilemma.  I have been sort of figuring that out by reading some of the posts from the women on the CMF board.  I also know someone who had that treatment 7 years ago and the others meds sound newer...but also more intensive.   The doc quoted a 35% chance of recurrence without ANY chemo, but I don't know how the numbers would be different with the two choices.  I'm 40, will be 41 in two weeks.  I'd like to look that up.  He also said if I had had one positive node I wouldn't have had a choice (no CMF), which is making me lean toward the more aggressive tx also.  We discussed the issue of younger age = more aggressive tumor but only in terms of recurrence.  I feel like if I don't do the more aggressive tx and the cancer comes back, I know I will feel like I didn't do all that I could have.  So I think I have a decision. Welcome to all new comers!  It sounds like we are going to be together a long time, so the more the merrier!  Not really -  I don't wish this on anyone.  But I'm so glad to have a place where other know exactly what I'm feeling/going through.  I have a great network of supportive friends and family and if I ever need anything, there will probably be more people to help than I know what to do with.  But this support is necessary, too.  To The Other Half - You are certainly welcome, but I'm also wondering if there isn't a board for \"other halves\".  I know the first thing my husband did was to talk to his women friends at work (he's an RN, too) and he found 2 that had bc.  He asks them a lot of questions and I think that helps him.  He also goes with me to all my appointments and asks questions there as well. O.K., I have rambled on now and think I made up for being gone all weekend.  LOL.  Cristine",

Wednesday - Lenny (#2), Becky (#1), Gracie713 (#1) Thursday - Angels (#2), 2Grace (#1), Me (#1) and Kristy (Herceptin) Friday - Dana (#?) Did I miss anyone?  Did I get the tx numbers right?  Is anyone going on Friday?  Looks like a full week coming up. ",

He wants to see me again in 4 months and have another PET scan beforehand. He also mentioned the possibility of having my ovaries out (even though I was triple neg) if I don't go into early menopause.

I'm also going to talk to him about my shoulder/arm and the issue of lymphedema. I have another follow-up (geez!) with the rad oncologist, in early January. Hopefully by then, I'll be done for awhile with them all. Thoughts go out to all having STUFF this week.  And Roxi, you're hair is cute!",

      "Content": "Jan 16, 2009 01:46AM - edited Jan 16, 2009 01:47AM by drcrisc Hey, I know it sounds weird, but I'm really enjoying reading everyone's story - thanks for indulging me.  I have written my story before on the Triple Neg thread (where we have eerily similar stories!), so here's mine... It's about 3 AM on February 28 (or March 1?).  I wake up to pee and somehow brush up against my right breast to feel this \"thing\" - right on the top, in the 12 o'clock position.  Never felt anything like before and hope I never do again.  It was at that moment that I knew, like Eddie said, in my heart of hearts.  I had had a really stressful 6 months at work and thought \"F**K!  That place gave me cancer!\"  I called my PCP the next morning and saw him that day and got the \"80%\" story.  You know, the one that goes something like \"Eighty percent of all breast lumps are benign cysts\"  That was a Friday and I had a mammo (first one ever!) and a US scheduled for the following Tuesday.  Apparently, the mammo didn't even pick up the lump we could all feel, but the US did.  I got confirmation of my feeling when I saw the radiologist who read the US right after the test.  She also gave me the 80% story but said \"You need to have a biopsy\" and again, I knew.  Mind you, I wasn't being negative or a worry-wart (although I touched the damn thing every 15 minutes - \"Is it gone?  Is it smaller?\").  I just knew.  I noticed also that the lump didn't hurt until after it got squished during the mammo.  Hmmmm...   I had a core needle biopsy the following Friday, March 13.  And I still remember this conversation with dh while waiting - \"Well, if it's nothing, that's okay,  We'll just leave it alone.\"  I stared at him and said \"Are you kidding me?!  I was this thing OUT!\"  I got the call from my PCP at work late the next Tuesday afternoon.  I knew as soon as I heard him that it was not good and my first thought was \"Pay attention, this is life changing information, don't get emotional or you won't remember a thing he says.\"  I don't remember much anyway.  Fortunately, it was late enough so there weren't many people at work (everyone can see in our offices for safety's sake) and 2 of my close friends were there.  That was the good part.  One of them drove me to my mom's house and I called my sister on the way.  I called my mom before we got out of the car and made her come outside because I knew I would break down (again) and didn't want to scare the girls.  My dh and I met with my surgeon the next day and he said the pathology was not fully conclusive and, like Jen's, offered another on-the-spot needle biopsy.  We opted to wait 2 days (Friday again) and have the excisional one instead and I was really glad because that actually ended up being the lumpectomy.  (\"OUT!  Take it OUT!\")  So, even though the surgeon said it wasn't clear, I still knew.  That being said, I also was hopeful someone had been wrong.  But when he called me at 6 PM the following Monday, I knew I had been right all along.  Damn.  Didn't want to be right.  The following Monday I had an MRI and the week after that, had a re-excision to get clear margins.  Whew.  March was quite a month.  I may month-long PTSD. Thanks for listening, girls.  I really felt the need to get that out - not sure why, I'm guessing because it's coming to that time of year again. Jen - I just want to throw in a WOOOOOOHOOOOO for Cancer Free!!!",

I echo Kristy's \"Top Ten Things To Be Grateful For\" and Eddie's push for us to move on together.  (Gracie, we will wait for you to finish rads!)  Better go - the girls are having friends over for the afternoon and I still have to take a shower!! ",

Karin - Congrats on your new position! Kerry - Were you a writer in your other life?  You have a marvelous way with words and, uh, sounds.  I heard that chicken precisely! Julie - I'm still taking the Xanax nightly.  I have \"experimented\" with not taking it and then I am sorry at 3 AM when I wake up and can't stop thinking.  Sleep is essential. Linda - Have a great weekend, sounds like a lot of fun! Gracie - A big decision, but sounds like you are settled about it.  Sometimes the decision-making is the hardest part!  And thanks, also, for sharing about your brother. Randie - Thinking of you, as always, girlfriend. Time for Xanax and sleep!!  And a bit of ibuprofen for the sore(er) boob!!

Randie - Glad we're at least making you chuckle.  Just tell the doc you're talking with all \"your people\" - it would be even better if you pointed at various spots in the room and started naming names - \"Oh, look, there's Otter at the foot of my bed\"  \"Robin brought waffles for breakfast\"  \"Rock!  Step away from the malted milk balls!!\"  Things like that.  Then you'll get reeeaaaalllllyy goooood drugs...aaaaahhhhh... Well, so far, no swine flu for anyone here.  Katie did make it to school this morning for her state testing and Kelly threw a full-out tantrum after she was brought home by grandma and didn't get to spend the night again.  However, this was after she had already changed her mind - twice.  Now I'm D.A.T...somebody wake me for waffles - I've got powdered sugar and whipped cream.",
