      "Content": "fihtermom wrote: Hi All, My mom who just completed her radiation therapy yesterday is getting conflicting advice from her radiation oncologist and her Medical Oncologist so wanted to get your opinion. My mother has been prescribed anastrazole as her tumor (2.5 cm with one lymph node involved) was ER positive (100%). She just finished her radiation therapy yesterday and her skin is in pretty bad shape. Her MO wants her to start anastrazole ASAP but her rad. onco. has told her to wait for at least a week before starting the endocrine therapy as she expects her radiation side effects to peak a week to two later after the end of the radiation therapy and she didn't want the medication to cause more problems. I wonder if there is also an interaction between the radiation and the anastrazole which could increase the side effects? Is it OK to wait or should we start the medication ASAP? It has been a total of 10 weeks since her lumpectomy and hormone therapy has not been started yet. Anyone else been in a similar situation? Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",

Could you please provide feedback on your experiences with any of the following surgeons? 1. Dr. C Denise Ching (PAMF) 2. Dr. Randolph W.Y. Wong (PAMF) 3. Dr. Frederick Dirbas (Stanford) Your advice/ feedback would be invaluable as we embark on the journey to cure my mother. Thank you so much and God Bless! FighterMom Log in to post a reply",
