Prior to her dx, we had run a few halfs, one full marathon, and a triathlon. Since then, she is just getting back into running shape.. a couple ofÂ miles a day. right now she is dealing with her mother's illness, and is finding the training a bit much in the current situation. But all in all, she is doing very, very well. Thanks! Erick",

If she flies, she wraps her arm in an ace bandage, she doesnt do hot tubs or saunas anymore, however, we told the therapist that we were into scuba and wondered how that might be affected, she came back and said it would probably be WONDERFUL for it.

      "Content": "Mar 7, 2008 07:12AM - edited Mar 7, 2008 10:59AM by erickcarpenter Thanks ladies, we will have this conversation, I vaguely remember her arm being measured and some advice being given to her. Not sure if she is following that advice, as my memory is lacking. and yes, 22 nodes were a bit much, but the surgeon found another positive lymph when she did the masctectomy. Had we listened to the first surgeon, Lynda would have a positive node AND more cancer left than he took out. (he took out 5 cm and left about 7). The second surgeon is the director for breast cancer at UCSD. She is some kind of doc. If you know of anyone in San Diego who needs surgery, she is the gal. Dr. Anne Wallace. Nothing but rave reviews from us. Erick",

With that, an email is going out to her rather soon... :D As she only had 22 lymph nodes removed, not sure how serious the likelihood of lymphedema truly is. (she is also quite athletic, and that may have a pretty good role in it) comments? Thanks! Erick Carpenter",
