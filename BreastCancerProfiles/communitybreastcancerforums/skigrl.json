It took about 3 weeks for it to kick in fully, but i have to say i am pain free. I may try to wean off it a little bit to see how it works. I take 100mg at bedtime, because it makes me to loopy during the day, and i am loopy enough already to have extra help in that department. So for any of you out there with nerve pain give Lyrica a try. Dx 10/2/2008, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 1/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My onc. sent me to see a orthepedic onc. because the radiologist at the hospital i go to couldnt be 100% sure what it was that showed up on my scan. So i went last may to see the ortho onc. he pretty much thoughtit was the enchondronam but also wasnt 100%....he said come back in 9 months to see if it has changed at all. He said it shouldnt be painful, but it is and has been getting worse. My leg is about an inch  more swollen the the other leg also. I am hoping it is just the benign condition. I was thinking of asking if i could take zometa just as a precaution. Do you take that? I am sorry you have so many lesions, crap i am sorry you got cancer!!!! my life has changed SO much in SO many ways since diagnosis. Some say cancer makes you appreciate what you have more, bullsh*t..i WAS appreciative before cancer and i WAS living my life to the fullest before this monster took my full life away.... i am NOT enjoying life as much as i did before cancer that is for sure. Maybe one day that will change.",

To respond to your previous post, I did not have an MRI , i had an x- ray of my leg and it showed something in my fibula. (i think i said tibia before). Like you 3katz, i too am still living my life to the fullest, i have 2 young kids 7 & 9 and we do LOTS with them. I hike, bike ,ski swim, run,kayak, travel........as much as i can, however it is not like it used to be, age and chemo have slooowwed me down some. But i still do it,in fact i am planning a winter camping trip soon. There are some days when i get down about having had to endure this disease, especially when i look at my body and see how it has changed. I HATE IT! BUT i am alive, and plan on being here for my kids. I cant imagine them not having me be in their lives. During my darkest time, during chemo when i felt like i was not going to make it through treatment #4, i thought that i would take my kids with me because i couldnt leave them behind. Glad those days are gone. PHEW! Thanks for checking in, i will let you know what happens with the appt.",

I tried Lyrica , but hated how I felt on it, even when taking it at bedtime, I also gained about 15 pounds which I am still trying to loose. So I went off the Lyrica. The neuropathy got so bad when I laid down at night that I was hardly sleeping and trying to function during the day with minimal sleep. Having a job and two young kids, I was a zombie . At my wits end I went to the local clinic and talked with the on call doc and told him my problem no sleep, blah blah. I wanted a sleeping pill, I was desperate, he said no sleeping pill. Instead he gave me a script for Amytriptyline. It is a anti depressant but also turned out to help people with neuropathy, thank god I took it, about two weeks into it I am sleeping through the night, don't feel the pain in my feet nearly as much as when I took Lyrica . I wake up refreshed. And also in a good mood because it is an anti depressant. I take 20 mg a night before bed and good night Irene! I plan to be on this med for a loooong time. Maybe your mom can talk to the doc about Amitriptyline.",

I have several lumps pop up on my head that i have not noticed before, i  have an appt. in Feb , maybe i should mention them. I really need to try and stay in the calm frame of mind also.

I cannot believe my husband and I have traveled all over the world and havent explored this gem literally in our back yard. We plan on going soon and bringing or renting bikes to take on the carriage Roads. The foliage should be turning nicely around the time of you trip.",

My oncologist asked me to describe it....i said the worst sunburn you could ever get followed by someone rubbing the highest grit sandpaper on your skin...and NOT stopping!!!!! He prescribed Lyrica for me, it has not worked for me yet, also makes me feel loopy, my plastic surgeon gave me a script of lidocaine patches to put directly on the skin....it numbs it a little, enough to let me do some light activities. It seems to be the only thing on my mind...people talk to me but i rarely hear what they say because i only think of the pain constantly nagging at me. Mine pain became so bad last night that i ended up drinking several glasses of wine and taking a pain pill to deal with it and let me sleep, i am afraid this will become a nightly way to deal with this horrble pain, just so i can get some rest. It's not enough that you have a cancer diagnosis, cutting a breast off, having to go through treatments, and now horrible pain, what else can come this way, anything good? Sorry to rant but the pain seems to make me a different person, i really dont care about other things right now except trying to get comfortable. Maybe i will write to santa and ask him for some relief. ;>) skigrl",
