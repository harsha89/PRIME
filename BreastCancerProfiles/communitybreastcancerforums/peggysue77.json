I am a travel nurse and work tele and CCU's. Big family hx of breast cancer, so choice to do bilat. My mamogram was negative but good Dr found a tiny ripple on exam and did an ultrasound and found it. Really stressed out about not being able to work. As a travel nurse there is no paid time off... no vacation or sick pay. All my work is 13 week contracts and I have break my current contract to go back to SD for surgery. Any ideas? Â Also 2000 miles from home right now and all my conversations with the surgeons have been over the phone and have lots of questions? Does anyone know how often you have fills after surgery or how long before the 2nd surgery when implants are done. Even with 30 years of nursing experience, don't know alot about this.... wasn't my specialty. Also not used to the idea of not being the caregiver!!!! Thanks!",
