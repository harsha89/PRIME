Hugs! Laura",

I will be starting on 5/28 with Adriamycin and Cytoxan and will have 4 doses, once every 3 weeks, followed by Taxol once a week for 12 weeks.  At the same time, I have chosen to participate in the E5103 clinical trial (80% chance I will be lucky enough to get the Avastin for either 6 or 12 months)--if not, it's a good feeling to know that in a small way I am doing something to help others who have to fight this horrible disease. Then I will have 3 weeks off (woo hoo!) followed by 6 1/2 weeks of radiation. Does anyone know how they determine if you should get a \"dense dose\"? (I am not getting that and forgot to discuss it with my oncologist yesterday).  Seems like it is a more aggressive treatment, and being \"triple negative,\" my understanding is that I need to be as aggressive as possible.",
