I had a mammogram that was clear and an US that also showed nothing. Went to a general surgeon and he said it was nothing. I insisted on action so he did a needle biopsy. Biopsy was clear but I felt like he just picked a spot and randomly stuck the needle in. I still wasn't satisfied and I knew that an inverted nipple was a classic sign of BC. I informed the surgeon that I was going to get a second opinion. At that time, he decided to do a regular biopsy under sedation. Of course, the biopsy showed BC and he proceeded to do a lumpectomy. I also had chemo and radiation. 15 years later I am diagnosed with mets to bone! Don't mess around with this....get as many opinions as you need to make sure that all is well! Will be praying for you :)",

I attributed it mostly to the loss of appetite and I did have mouth sores for a while that kept me from eating properly. I'm told that Affinitor also interferes with food absorption, so that could be part of the cause. All in all, I must say I don't really like this combo because too many weird things have occurred since I started at the end of October. My latest \"complication\" was shortness of breath and low oxygen levels. After numerous tests failed to reveal anything definitive, I have come home from the hospital on 2 liters of oxygen. Not a happy camper right now! MM",
