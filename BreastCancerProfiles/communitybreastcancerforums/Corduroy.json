I was like \"Wait, that's 20 weeks of chemo!\" They had previously said 4 months. My question is this - when should I expect to have to deal with eyebrows/lashes falling out? I wanted to cold cap, but had decided if my MO wanted an AC treatment I wouldn't, because seeing the outcomes from AC even with Penguin didn't leave me feeling like the cost and huge hassle was worth it. But I teach undergrads so am trying to minimize any appearance of looking sick. My MO said that the AC was the worst and the weekly Taxol wasn't that bad, which is why I decided not to do the dose-dense Taxol regimen. Ugh, do not want. Not looking forward to this at all. And giving myself the neulasta shot! aaaaaahhhh! I am not scared of needles but IDK about giving myself a shot. I guess my husband can do it.",

My doc likes people to try without a port first, but they had to stick me twice to get the IV in, and since I'm doing 4xAC and then 12 weekly taxols, the chemo nurse was like \"you really should just get a port. If they had to stick you twice on the first day, it's not going to get any better.\" She said delivering the AC via port is also safer because it's such a toxic drug. The scary thing was that I had an allergic reaction to the IV Emend drug. The MO's NP said \"oh this rarely hardly ever happens, almost never, I don't know why I'm bringing it up\" and then it happened. It was actually pretty scary. It went from \"I am feeling weird\" to \"I am seeing stars\" and the nurse asking me if I was having trouble breathing, and I thought about it, and yes, I was having trouble breathing, Swollen lips, flushed face, they stopped the Emend immediately and then pumped me full of benadryl and steroids. I felt a little loopy- slurring words etc. even after it was all done. I sucked on ice chips the whole time hoping this might prevent mouth sores. So far today, so good. I have to take the Emend in pill format today and tomorrow, but I haven't really been nauseated at all. I have been taking my anti-nauseas as directed, making sure I am keeping ahead of it, though. But I have eaten, I don't have a problem drinking, etc. I am not working today (I work part-time) but I feel like I could go. I have to go back in today for the Neulasta - they are trying to confirm that my insurance will pay for the auto-inject thing, but until they do, this time I have to go in and get the shot, which is a bit of a hassle but whatever. I pick up my wig on Thursday. I told my students that I was starting chemo b/c I had to cancel office hours (I teach undergrads) and they have been so supportive. A lot of them have had BC in their families, so are sympathetic. I am planning on buzzing my hair over T'giving weekend and going in with the wig on the Wednesday afterwards. Not looking forward to that, but what can I do? I am getting a super amazing wig, so at least that will look good. I should go for a walk but haven't managed it yet. Don't feel super fatigued today, although I was up every 2 hours to pee. Good to flush it all out of my bladder, though! The NP said that tye Cytotoxan will irrtate your bladder if you don't go pee a lot, so I need to keep hydrated.",
