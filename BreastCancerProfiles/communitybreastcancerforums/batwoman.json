I actually got one student evaluation at the end of the course that said, \"It was really a pain for the students to have to get used to a new professor halfway through the semester....\" I loved your possible responses, Surly! I think I would react the same way. People need to keep their own religious beliefs to themselves. And I also avoid Walmart; I think they breed zombies there.",

When I was diagnosed in 2009 w/ stage III (and at first they told me it was IV, but misdiagnosed), I freaked. I spent so much time reading the primary literature about BC, looking at the stats, calculating my own chances. I lost all joy in life. Now, I've found that, at least for me--and I can ONLY speak for myself--I had to focus on my great professonal life, my excellent family, my sweet dog, and stop reading the literature, getting on web sites (well, I do log on here once in awhile), and even thinking about it. I'm better off. I have reclaimed that joy, although I realize that one trip to the clinic and that could change. I wish you the best for the new year, and the best luck in treatment, and also the best in survivial. Be strong, lady.",

I love spiders, even though I've had a brown recluse bite that didn't heal for months! Spider venom may turn out to have some medical benefit, but even if not they catch insects and the most dangerous arthropod is the mosquito! I never kill spiders in my house--if they are a bit big, I catch them and put them outside. Would love to tell you my positive experiences with spiders!! I had a cute tarantula once that liked to rip the heads off crickets.....oh wait, I don't mean to creep anyone out on this site!! I think airplanes are the scariest thing in the world.",
