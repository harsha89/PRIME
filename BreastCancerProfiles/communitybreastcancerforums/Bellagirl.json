Dx in 8/07 with IDC, Stage IIB, SLN+, triple negative.  I am writing because I had a mastectomy with lymph node dissection and for someone with a high tolerance for pain, I found the pain to be excruciating. It hurt so bad a few days post-op that I was balling my head off at the thought of getting out of bed to go to the bathroom, and taking Percocet every two hours. I couldn't sleep more than a couple of hours at a time, and would wake in pain. My first explanation from my doctor was that the cause of pain was due to the drain going into the armpit where the nodes were removed.  I was still about a week away from getting the drain removed and hurting so bad. My Onc nurse asked the Dr on my behalf if neurontin could be used.  I must say that it worked so well.  With the narcotic meds, you cannot drive, but you can with neurontin after your drains are removed and you have become used to your dose of meds.  Neurontin is an anti-siezure med that is used for nerve pain. My nurse said it actually anesthetizes the nerves that have been severed during the surgery, and yes, it can take months for the nerve pain to feel better. My pain starts at the elbow and radiates up the back portion of my arm into the breast area. I still have some pain but it's tolerable and anymore meds would make me too dopey, but it allows me to do my exercises to keep the range of motion in those muscles that have been compromised.  Hope this helps.",

Istarted my first cycle of chemo on 10/30/07 A/C.  Of course, they give you plenty of nausea meds but I was so nauseated for 4 days.  I have little strength. no appetite (I eat because I know I need to).  I am very sensitive to smells and constipated and feel so lousy.  I've always been the one who takes care of everyone else, and to be so ill is humbling and new.  I'm so grateful to have this website to let me vent and talk with others that are going through the same thing, I get my chemo every 2 weeks and I,m not looking forward to Nov 13th, my next A/C dose. Thanks ladies for your spirit and love and concern for us all. Bellagirl Dx 8/07, IDC, SLN+, Er/pr-, HER2-, BRCA 1&2-",

I'm so grateful for you ladies-I was feeling down in the dumps last night and then I log in and there you are with encouragement, hope, and the experience of what I'm going through.  Bless you all",
