I also have two more MRI guided biopsies because the scan also showed my cancer has spread to the right and the left tumor is bigger than thought. My port gets installed on the 13th and I start chemo on the 14th. The way I look at it is that I have basically no control over most of it except for my attitude. I find little things to hold on to that make me look at  the situation through a different lens, however cynical they may be. I've never been much of a pot smoker so my latest encouraging thought is that maybe I can a medical marijuana card and re-live  my wild youth. I would definitely be the coolest, baldest mom in the neighborhood. Hey what ever works right.",

My BS is my PS and she is 100% confident that I will only have a small incision.  So much for getting those awesome new perky boobs. I will also have a lymph node dissection on the left side which will give me only one drain. The plan is only one night in the hospital. I got a scrpt for a cami which I understand I can get at the local Nordstroms.  Life is good and I am looking forward to the surgery being behind me.",

My doctor prescribed xclair creme to be applied 3x/day during radiation to prevent irritation. I can even wear it before rad. Onc Rad says it is the only topical solution that can be applied to my skin before rad. So far no irritation but I'm sure it is too early. One downside is that insurance does not cover this cream and it is $70 tube. Regarding bras-I got a prescription and complete insurance reimbursement for post surgical/rad bras.  You may want to ask you insurance company if you are covered. I have 2 very soft cotton front opening bras. Cannot recall the brand name. They may not be the prettiest undergarment on the market but they are sure comfortable and not to mention Free. I'm in the middle of my training for the 3-day walk in November and very concerned about how much I should actually be walking while going thru rad.  I've managed maintain a decent training schedule during chemo and surgery but now the recommended training miles are getting pretty intense.  Last week I walked over 40 miles. I feel ok but I fear that the cumulative effect of rad and walking may take its toll.  The only advice from the rad/onc is do as much as you are able and be prepared that you maynot be able to do the walk.   Has anyone else experienced fatigue from rad?",

Thanks calamtykel for sharing the scar project. I have not decided on which type of surgery I will be getting so seeing these beautiful women with all different types of scars help me to not be so afraid. I see that most are getting BMX. Based on previous conversations with my PS/BS I have a feeling she will try to steer me into getting a lumpectomy on the left side.  She was pretty adamant about not getting a bmx.  I see most of the July sisters and most every BS survivor I meet is getting BMX. Is this all about piece of mind or did your PS/BS recommend it???? orchidgal-Love the MMJ story. When I was diagnosed I ask my onc if I could get a prescription and she said \"I'm not that kind of doctor\".  It has been about 30 years since I enjoyed the MJ and I seriously considered partaking during this whole cancer ordeal.  That is until my 18 y/o son decided to get his MMJ card. My husband and I are livid about this. I guess now I would feel like a hypocrite. Darn teenagers! Hats off to all you strong July sisters out there.  I love love love reading  your brave stories. I'm glad I found this group to ease my anxiousness about the upcoming surgery. I am also grateful to be at the end of the month so I can learn from all of you. And for that I thank you very much. I just finished reading \"The Definitive Guide to Cancer\" An integrative Approach to Prevention, Treatment and Healing\" by Lise N Alschuler and Karolyn Gazella. Good book similar to \"The Anticancer Diet\".  I'm really trying to be the best patient ever so I can beat this and to never have it reoccur. In my strive for anticancer perfection, I think I zapped all the fun out of my life. There has  to be a happy medium!!!! Most of my adult life, I lived a natural healthy active lifestyle so I struggle with what tweaks need to be made to heal and prevent recurrence. Can I really live without the triple crown-wine, coffee and stress? ",

My story is totally different but....I have only had chemo and no surgeries yet. I had 6 months of chemo with the intent downstage the tumors  including a 6+cm  on the left side. I had a mri after the first 3 months of A/C and the tumors have responded very well. Most were at least 1/2 the size as before surgery.  The BS said that if I respond as well to the taxol, she will most likely be able to do just a lumpectomy. Since I have lymph node involvement, radiation is a given, regardless of what type of surgery. I had another MRI last week and will meet with the BS this week to review the results and finalize surgery plan.  Yesterday I re-read the surgery section in Susan Love's Breast Book and she basically convinced me that given the choice, opt for breast conserving surgery and not the BMX.  So I think I have made up my mind. The only caveat is that once the bs starts digging in,she may find other stuff. For those of you who have yet to start chemo, do not fret. After completing 12 weeks of A/c and 12 weeks of T/H.  While it was not the party of my life, I did survive and you will too.",

I was attributing the pain to 3 months of taxol but it seems to be getting worse even after chemo has stopped.  The pain seems to be worse right after I get up from either sleeping of sitting for a long period of time.  I am a very active person and the sore feet thing is starting to crimp my lifestyle. So sorry to hear about September rad sisters who have to drive long distances for radiation. I am extremely fortunate to have a university cancer center that is less than 1 mile from work.  I scheduled most of my appointments around my lunch hour so I can take a leisurely walk to and from the center.  Typically a coworker will join me for the walk and we will get frozen yogurt after wards. Since Dec 2009, I've walked to the cancer probably 100 times. It is so much a part of my daily routine, but I cannot say I will miss it when it is gone. Today is 12 of 33 rads.  I'm starting to feel a little burning and not a whole lot of fatigue. I have an entry in the Nike Women's 1/2 marathon (walking i time)  on Oct 17 so I really hope the burning, pain and fatigue does not get much worse.",
