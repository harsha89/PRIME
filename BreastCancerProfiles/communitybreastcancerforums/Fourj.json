The hair thining stared about 6 months ago. It is very bad, especially when I am in shower :-(. I dream about being bald. I have started to use the Biotin shampoo and take some vitamins good for hair, but those do not help. What is your experience? Will this thining ever slow down? I am still young (39). Hair is still important to me. Do you think switching to other medicine could help? I had the ovary surgery done and could switch to other hormon blockers from tamoxifen if that helps. Thanks!
