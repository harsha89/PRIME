Its whiteish with dark undertones in the back and very curly! Very thin at the temples though. My brows are finally in and my eyelashes are starting to appear again. I'm very happy...however, I'd like to go back to being a brunette. Actually I haven't seen my real hair color in the past 40 years! My friends and hubby love the short whitish-grey poodle hair and are encouraging me to keep it, but when I look into the mirror .....I don't see me! I only see cancer. I'm going to buy Nioxin today at Amazon, and also start taking Biotin. Yeterday I saw my breast cancer surgeon and she said that I should wait 6 months to dye my hair because it may turn a wierd color. Well, my daughter's wedding is in December and I'm not sure I can wait that long. Can you imagine...I've had 2 months of AC, and 3 months of Taxol...and the thing I'm concerned about is my hair!  Also kind of scared to go \"topless\", but whoa....its getting hot under my wig when I go shopping!   Good news...I finally had the expander removed, a silicon implant put in, and had a breast lift on the other one! Lord, I have the boobs of a 22 year old! Feels great to wear a bra again! Life is good....  ",
