It is about the size of a walnut, and not painful. My left breast has often had shooting pains that feel like they start at my nipple and head in towards my chest wall. The same place as my lump. I've just contributed it to part of being a woman. I'm 39, and haven't had a mammogram yet. I saw my GP today who has sent a referral for an urgent diagnostic mammogram, which she warned can still take weeks. She said she would say it feels like a clogged milk duct, but it's not possible, as my baby is 10 years old. She made mention of the very prominent veins on my breast as well. And she said, \"Don't be alarmed, these could be normal.\" She assured me that I had no reason to worry. But I'm not feeling very reassured. Our health care system seems to move in slow motion. I wish I had something else to think about and focus on. Tick. Took. Log in to post a reply",
