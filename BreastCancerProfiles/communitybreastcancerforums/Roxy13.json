The treatment seems similar (I'm TC but no H). You have probably seen that already, but there are a couple of threads on TC here with useful tips and coping mechanisms. One (Tiffany's terrific tips for TC I think it's called) has some tips for wearing the cold cap. It works well from what I heard. The wig is not fun either. I bought one yesterday and found it itchy, plus the idea of wearing someone else's hair grossed me out a bit. Plus - it looks like a wig. It is what it is. If you have any tips about eyelashes and eyebrows, please share. :) My hospital has workshops on looking good through treatment and I'll attend. Maybe I'll learn a thing of two. Happy holidays, ladies! Yes we'll get through this! R",

Both of them are doing well now (cancer free, of course!). They both reached out when they heard about my diagnosis to chat. What I found really encouraging is that the cancer was a distant memory to them! And one of them was Her2 positive with an impacted node as well! So I try to think of this not as the end of everything, but as a speed bump in my life. After all, it is treatable! I also try not to let it get to me and keep a semblance of normal life at home.

This is the background: both my mother and her sister had bc (interestingly, I tested negative for the BRCA 1 and 2). My mother died in 2005, her sister is alive and doing well. For this reason, I've been doing mammograms since I was 39, at my doctor's suggestion. They've been normal until 2017. At the beginning, I used to go every year. Since the mammograms were normal, my doctor told me I could go every other year, and that's what I've done. So my last normal mammogram was in 2015, and I skipped 2016. Well, we all know what happened in 2017. The whole time since my diagnosis, I've been wondering what would have been the situation if I had a mammogram in 2016. It may not have picked anything up, or it might have picked up a much smaller tumour in which case, who knows, I might have gotten away with no chemo, and . the odds of recurrence might have been lower. I don't know... The thing is, when I met with my family doctor to arrange for the referrals to the breast surgeon when I started the process, we looked at the mammogram results from prior years, and I saw the notes in the 2015 mammo that said: \"very dense breast tissue, recommend returning next year\". Or something like that. Clearly, they wanted me to go every year, while my doctor led me to believe that it's ok to skip a year (and stupidly, I agreed). So I told some friends the story, and they thought I should change family doctors. One recommended her doctor, which she finds very competent (and this friend of mine is very picky). I'm leaning towards moving, and not just because of this. There were some other things that didn't sit well with me with this doctor. For example, she diagnosed depression, but didn't refer me to a therapist or gave me a prescription. It's only after my cancer diagnosis that she gave me something. Then again... Her office is close to my house, and I've been with her for over 10 years (in good health, so I didn't need her much). My husband thought I shouldn't bother, especially since I'll be seeing specialists, but I don't know.... Would like to hear your thoughts! Hope everyone is doing well!   ",

He never said anything about removing my ovaries, and my understanding is that this won't be necessary since I'm BRCA negative, which means lower risk of ovarian cancer. Why would they suggest this to you? Is it the Tamoxifen side effects? Also, wondering what makes your cancer so aggressive. Is it your PR negative status? I'm only 5% PR positive, which means higher risk of recurrence. Probably the only reason I'm doing chemo. I didn't even do the oncotype test, which I expect would have been high.

My MO scheduled the infusions on Thursdays, so I can be more or less recovered for Mondays, I guess, but this makes it so difficult for me, because weekends with kids are not really a time when I can properly rest. I like having the house to myself when the kids and husband are away during the week. I don't even feel guilty about not doing much around the house. As a full-time working mom of two kids (and a dog :)), life was so hectic for me before I got diagnosed that I am taking the downtime as a treat. I miss work, but I know I'll miss having some time to myself. I won't be doing radiation therapy, because I had the mastectomy and nodes and margins were clear. The next steps is to start Tamoxifen, in six weeks or so. We'll see. I tried reading the tamoxifen thread, but geez these threads are scary, with everyone describing their worst side effects. I think I'll stay away.... I'm also puzzled with what's happening with my body hair. I still have hair on my arms, and the hair on my legs is in limbo - also have the stubble from before, and I have to confess, I just didn't have the heart to shave it. The hair is fine, and not noticeable, but I just couldn't bear to part with more of my own hair than I already had... I have about half the eyebrows and my eyelashes have thinned out, but not noticeable if I wear mascara. Which I try not to, because I'm worried that I'll lose more eyelashes when I remove the makeup. Interestingly, I still have hair on my head, although it's hard to tell if it would cover my entire head. It's buzzed short and it hasn't grown since I buzzed it. I'm also not sure why my nails grow when my hair doesn't. Maybe it is the icing? (see below :)) And yes, I agree that icing helps. I know I said it before. My hospital provided the ice, and all it was was a ziploc bag with ice (closed) inside another ziploc bag where I put my fingers and toes. Very easy to make at home. Take care, ladies!",

It's short, and unfortunately it is salt and pepper now, but I got full coverage. How long do we have to wait to colour it? I heard six months, but I'm tempted to do it sooner. I'm hoping for a nice pixie next months. Most importantly, my eyebrows are coming in nicely. I don't know if it was the Biotin, but the bald spots are gone. Congrats on the genetic test results! I got mostly no mutations, but they weren't sure about a couple of the genes (not the BRCA ones, some of the more obscure ones that they now test). Apparently they don't have enough to benchmark against, and based on what they had, mine were different, so I'm supposed to call every year and ask if they found something new. Can anything be simple in this whole process? Regarding dense breasts - mine were also very dense, even in my 40s. They should do the MRIs regardless. Amelia - I hear your concern about the wig. I want to take mine in to get lowlights and get it washed and styled properly, but it's the only one I have and I don't go out without it. Sadly, when my kids bring their friends over, they check to make sure I have it on. So it goes... I'd be interested to know what the other wig wearers do for wig care. Do you wash it yourself? How often? I wash it almost every week, because I also exercise with it on, and it gets sweaty. Take good care, ladies, and have a wonderful weekend! xo",

The total anesthesia - it was my first time too. All I remember is having a nice, deep, uninterrupted sleep. Something I noticed when I woke up, this being something those of us who have kids learn to appreciate and remember for a long time :) I was part of the November 2017 surgery group and documented my trials and tribulations through the mx there. I think even back then I said I didn't find the whole thing too bad. It's mostly uncomfortable. Take your painkillers - I was given Oxycontin and my husband was worried about addiction, but I wasn't going to tough it out and took them as needed. At the end I had a few pills left and flushed them down the toilet. I didn't develop any addictions. Regarding my rib met alarm - yes, I did feel some pain, fairly sharp at first, under my right breast, just a week or two after I had finished my chemo. I went to see the PS and she thought it was muscle pain. At that time, the pain had dulled and it was fairly superficial. It was in an area where they had stitched the Alladerm (sp?) to tissue. I didn't do any other tests (my choice). The pain is still there, very dull, and seems to increase after I exercise, so it's most likely just muscle. Best! And hugs to the rest of the ladies!",

The studies change, so it\u2019s probably just easier for them to tell us to stop taking additional stuff. I guess once we are done our chemo, they figure we are on our own, so we can do whatever.

I don\u2019t know how the BS can opine on that before the surgery. They (the BS and the plastic surgeon) told me that even if I do need it, there has been so much progress in radiation therapy that it should not interfere with the implants. It\u2019s really targeted. I had an MRI and ultrasounds before the surgery, which showed the nodes were clear, but they don\u2019t know for sure until they get the pathology report. I don\u2019t know if I would recommend to do the same. In retrospect, I was a bit stupid, and vain for wanting breasts right awa. It was really important for my mental health to, as my PS said \u201cgo to bed with breasts, wake up with breasts\u201d. Definitely something to talk to your BS about. The breasts themselves look nice. I wouldn\u2019t say they look natural without a bra, but they look natural with a bikini top. Not like porn star breasts or anything (I\u2019m 34C now, so there is that :)) They don\u2019t feel natural though, but they are not uncomfortable by all means. They seem to have their own temperature (cool) when my body is warm. I guess it\u2019s the silicone :) The surgery itself was not too bad. They sent me home the same day, but I think it\u2019s a Canadian thing. In the US they stay overnight, which is probably better. The pain was manageable WITH the pain killers. Take them as you need them. I didn\u2019t shy away from the opioid they gave me. I had a few left at the end, and flushed them down the toilet, so I didn\u2019t develop any new addictions.

The first few weeks were a bit of an adjustment. It made me a little dizzy, and decreased my appetite (could have been something else, though, who knows). I didn't get hot flashes or any other nasty side effects, at least not yet. I'm more concerned that I've developed PTSD. I got prescribed some anti-axiety medication at the time of my diagnosis, as I had some major panic attacks, but had to get off them because they interfered with the Tamoxifen. I got an alternate prescription, but decided not to take it and see what happens. But now that I'm not busy doing chemo and seeing doctors all the time, I think the enormity of this whole thing just hit me\u2026. We'll see. I keep meeting people that went through this years ago.

Whatever hot flashes I had I had during chemo, so that part was over. XO",

When I change at the gym, I make sure I turn towards the lockers so no one can see my breasts. The scars are still pretty red, anyway, so even with reconstructed nipples my breasts would look scary.

Congratulations, Insideout2 and DiagnosisDistruption on your one year anniversary! My hair is growing nicely and I finally lost that cancer face. Yesterday, I had nipple reconstruction surgery. I'd been debating whether I should even bother, and decided to go for it. I still have the dressings on and haven't seen the results. I'm scared to look, to be honest. I don't expect that my breasts will ever look natural... Before my surgery yesterday, I was waiting on a bed, and a lady in the bed beside me was going in for a mastectomy. In the recovery room, there was another (or the same?) lady who was coming out of a mastectomy. I was thinking that was us not long ago. What a journey... Love R",

It has recipes for different side effects, for before, during and after chemo. In short: bone broth, smoothies with protein powder, root vegetables. I don't think the foods mitigate the side effects completely, but at least I feel that I'm still in control of something (what I put in my body). Hugs to all",

And when I did, I got some strange reactions (people who disappeared, people who asked me what caused it - which is possibly the dumbest thing to ask a cancer patient, people who pretended to offer help - like my MIL who offered to lend me their old hair clippers for, you know, when I lose my hair). In my pre-cancer life, I had more patience with all these characters, now I just dismiss them altogether. And for the most part, people have been quite kind and gracious. Not that I asked for anything. Long story short - I tell everyone. It's nothing to be ashamed of and a good way to eliminate toxic people in your life. And now - off skiing. Me and my runny nose.

I have a private insurance plan that covers $250 only, and my husband\u2019s $300. I think longer hair wigs are even more expensive - they can be up to $3,000.

For one, they stuck the needle in a vein in the inside of my arm, for the second, on the outside. Both infusions were less than 2 hours long, and they are three weeks apart. They did such a good job (I'm in Toronto, at the Princess Margaret Hospital), you couldn't even see the needle mark the next day. I'm very thin, and I guess my veins are more visible, but I really think that the nurses were just very skilled. I got nasty bruises before, after doing blood work, and I attributed that to the nurse's lack of skill. It's not right and it's not normal. I got this one nurse at my family clinic who seems to struggle with everything (as an aside, she was the one to remove my IUD, and it took her 20 minutes and two speculums to find the strings, and I'll spare you the details). She's the one who always bruises me after taking blood. I used to be more polite, but ever since I got diagnosed with cancer, I avoid her and ask for someone else. So in conclusion, I wonder if the bruise, @Deaelle,had to do more with the nurse than with your veins. @WorriedMe77 - you have a lot of balls, girl! Good for you for taking charge of your hair!!! I'm glad you started the chemo and decided to stay in this group! I personally like to hear from everybody. @Amelia, good luck tomorrow! I usually listen to podcasts throughout the infusion. I save the good, less boring ones for the day. I like to listen to fiction from the New Yorker. It's all I can do, since they ice my fingers and toes, and I can't read because I can't flip the pages. My husband goes with me, but I'm not the chatty kind, and I just do my own thing, and he works, so it's like being alone in a way. I am meeting a radiation oncologist on Wednesday (Valentine's day :)) We'll see what he has to say. To those with infusions coming up this week - best of luck!

It\u2019s in the sink, on my sweaters, and the showers are a nightmare. I have to constantly pick hair from the drain, then it gets stuck to my wet fingers. I wear a wide silk hairband most of the time, to keep things in check. Still... I also saw some people at the cancer centre that probably also decided not to buzz, and didn\u2019t like the look. It looked like they had grass growing in the mud on their heads (bald patches everywhere), like my husband would say :) I went to one of those \u201cLook Good Feel Better\u201d workshops at my cancer centre and they told us to buzz it (if we do decide to buzz it) at #1, not the lowest setting, so we don\u2019t get cuts. I think many hair salons do it for free for cancer patients. Like I said, I\u2019m going tomorrow but I\u2019m dreading, dreadin the stares. Oh well, I\u2019ll just glare at them :) I\u2019m also hoping my stylist will trim my wig, because it doesn\u2019t have a stylish cut. I just don\u2019t trust the ladies at the wig salon to do it.

We live in a time where breast cancer is treatable, so why shouldn\u2019t we expect that we will put this behind us once we are done the treatment? Yes, we will always have the fear of recurrence, but I\u2019m not sure that we are any different from the people that never had cancer. We apre just more sensitized to the possibility that it can happen! And I truly think that the moment we start having doubts that we can beat this, we lost half the battle! On a happier note, I\u2019m back from the hair salon. Driving there was like going to the slaughter, but it wasn\u2019t too bad overall. I didn\u2019t buzz my hair, I pixied it. It was my stylist\u2019s suggestion. He said it won\u2019t be as noticeable. I also got my wig trimmed. I won\u2019t bore you with the pixie, but am attaching a pic of the wig.

I think the Neulasta kept me well protected, because most numbers were normal, so I\u2019ll try to keep that in mind next time, before I complain of aches and pains. One thing worried me, but not the MO - I developed mild anemia. The hemoglobin was at 115 - the low end of the range at my hospital is 120. I hear others go with 105. So they told me it\u2019s normal and to be expected, but I don\u2019t know... I think it\u2019s also part of the reason I\u2019m tired and weak. Has anyone else experienced this? And what, if anything, do you do about it? I take a multi-vitamin with iron in it but it doesn\u2019t look like it helped.

She's a girly girl, and we always went to the hair salon, nail salon, Body Shop, cheapy jewelry stores, you name it, together. We share the shampoo and conditioner. Well, shared, anyway, until I lost my hair. She's always starting to develop breasts, so this makes it even more difficult and emotional. I know that there are books on how to speak to your kids about cancer. I haven't read them, but they may help. My approach was to focus on the positive aspects: breast cancer is treatable, good doctors, they caught it relatively early, good prognosis... I chose to leave out some of the more inconvenient details: tumour size, grade etc. I also didn't get into detail on what the double mastectomy entails. I'm one of those parents that think that the naked truth is not always beneficial to children this young, but others may do differently, and it's probably ok. We were lucky in that the moms and other women we know with breast cancer (and there are many), are all alive and well. This changes the perspective, I think.

I was feeling very emotional right after I finished my chemo, as I\u2019m sure I mentioned on this board. In fact, the only time I cried during this process was after I rang the bell. Not when I heard the diagnosis, or that they found suspicious spots on my MRI, or through the biopsies, the call backs... It was at the very end.

The freebies are nice, but what I really found useful was the part on wigs, scarves and hats. They show you what to wear and how. They also showed us these \"face framers\" that I thought were a great idea: it's like a half wig (hair only comes out to the sides) and you can wear a beanie or scarf on top and you don't get that chemo face as much. There was a lady in my class who was wearing a wig that looked so natural I was convinced it was her real hair. This put me in a better mood. Honestly, I think if we didn't lose our hair we wouldn't be dreading chemo so much. It was also useful to get some perspective. I was the only one with breast cancer in that workshop and compared to other cancers, from what I heard from chatting to the women, bc is not so bad. Anyway. I keep looking for positive aspects to cope. Like the fact that I will have at least two hours of me time tomorrow. Pathetic, I know, but as a busy working mom with two kids, husband and dog, I hardly ever get these breaks. In good health!",

If the odds are on my side and I manage to stay cancer free for 10 years, I'm hoping that whatever happens 10 years from now, there would have been more progress towards a cancer cure. Just like the treatment options are so much better today than, say 15 years ago (or so I hear). I just want to see my kids grown. On a happier note: I had a pretty good day today. I went to yoga for the first time since I lost my hair. I was so self-conscious about going to my exercise classes with no hair, I cancelled a couple. But I went, kept my Lululemon hat on the whole time (it stays put even during the downward dog!) No one looked and no one cared. Then I decided to wash my wig so it doesn't smell like that awful shampoo they used at the wig shop and which triggered my chemo nausea. So I did it after watching some how-to videos on Youtube. I managed to make the wig hair just like mine used to be: neither straight, nor wavy, juat messy. It was like getting my old life back for a moment :) At least now it smells like rosemary-mint. @garifalia - I didn't have that issue on my scalp. Hope it goes away.

I will also ask other survivors what they do. I rang the bell today. They must have scheduled all the finalists in the afternoon, because the bell was ringing non-stop. It was emotional. I cried.

It's not because I've forgotten you now that I'm done my chemo, but to be honest, I've been feeling kind of blah, to say the least, since I've finished. I'm really bored, the weather has been terrible here, with no signs of spring, and I'm still feeling very very tired, even though it's been three weeks since my last TC. I can't get through the day without a nap, and I have such a hard time getting up from that nap, that I started to dread it. I don't sleep very well at night either, so I keep needing the nap, so voila, a vicious circle. I thought I'd be happy to be done, and didn't expect to feel so blue (and I am taking a mild anti-depressant, but not sure I want to up the strength\u2026) I also heard that exercise prevents the risk of recurrence, so keep it up, ladies! I'd also be interested to see if you have made any lifestyle changes (if necessary, of course :)). I was the picture of health after my mastectomy. No alcohol, juicing, smoothies, greens every day, exercise (I still exercise daily). Things went downhill during chemo. I ate whatever I could tolerate and helped me get through chemo, I started having the odd glass of wine (my MO said it's ok, but I don't know...). I don't have much energy to cook healthy meals, other than dinner. I am by myself during the day, and don't feel like making salads for one, so many times I just have a sandwich for lunch. I tried to limit sugar, and when I get a craving, I reach for fruit. It's still got sugar, of course, but it's better. Thank you to those that shared their knowledge re checking for recurrence. I am meeting my MO on April 26th and will ask a few questions. I also heard, @Erob321, that after a mastectomy, any new lumps (knock on wood) will be at the surface. With reconstruction, they insert the new \"boobs\" under muscle tissue, so it lifts the whole area. I am worried about recurrence in the lungs, or liver, bones, brain, geez, there are so many other places it can creep back, so plan to ask about that. Hope everyone is doing well, and am sending lots of good vibes to all, and especially those continuing with the treatment. Lots of love  R",

I tested negative for the BRCA 1 and 2, and a bunch of other genes, yet my mother and her sister both had breast cancer. That\u2019s a pretty big coincidence.... On a happier note, I also moved from an A cup before the mx to a C after reconstruction. My PS said he would give me a B, but when I went br shopping and they measured me I was 34C. I have to say I\u2019m quite pleased with the results. If only they didn\u2019t look so fake :))) Have a great Sunday, everyone! Big hugs",

She was positive it was a pulled muscle, which made sense. The pain has subsided. She said she could order an ultrasound, and I deferred until June, when I have my 6 month checkup (post mx). Maybe I should have gone for it anyway, but to be honest, I just wanted a break from poking and prodding and waiting for test results and the works. She did say one thing I wanted to share here - that it\u2019s not the aches and pains we should worry about, it\u2019s the new lumps. Hope everyone is doing well is doing well and enjoying the weather, wherever you are. X",

After all, the gene is in your family and, like you said, no one had gastric cancer. Just because you have bc doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get this one too. After all, breast cancer is so common, it was just a higher likelihood. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll get a few opinions, and I\u2019m sure you will.

I've been on Tamoxifen for over three months now. I take it at night. I didn't have any serious side effects - no hot flashes. I was a bit dizzy at the beginning, and my MO said it's to be expected, with the body adjusting to the hormonal changes. Everybody is different, of course. I'm back at work, and had a pretty good summer. My energy level is back to normal, and life is again pretty hectic - work, kids, etc. It's amazing how easy it is to put this whole thing behind, once treatment is over. BC is becoming a distant memory for me, and I hope it stays that way. Just thought I'd mention that. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Lots of love! R",
