I'm very happy with their care - the staff and facility and everything is just so great! I believe that, should I be told anything like you were, I too, would opt for an elective preventive mastectomy. I know too many people who would have wanted to have the option of \"preventing\" their cancer before they had it, and given the tools, would have. It is amazing that you were found to have IDC post mastectomy - I think that must have been divine intervention, for sure! Hoping it is something non-bc, and non-bc-precursur :) Feeling fairly confident that it is \"nothing to worry about\" :) The breast specialist is also sending me for genetic counseling due to family history - which will determine whether it is deemed \"medically necessary\" for me to have MRIs instead of Mammograms for my routine screening (I believe this is for \"later\" when I'm 40, assuming all comes back ok). Thank you for sharing your story! I will update what happens with my tests after Friday. It is so strange, I don't really know how to describe it, but I'm more worried that I'm not worried enough and will be completely SHOCKED if they say it is something... I'm just super-glad to have it being checked and taken seriously!",

I definitely wanted to breast feed any future child I've had a mammogram, but apparently because I am only 29 and have \"dense\" breasts, there was nothing they could see. Tried two ductograms, couldn't complete the procedure - first time because the lady just couldn't insert the cannula, second time (at a nationally recognized teaching and research hospital) because they couldn't identify where to insert it. I've also had two ultrasounds, neither of which showed anything... or at least they determined whatever was seen to be \"normal\"... the last ultrasound tech took quite a few images of the exact area I pressed to get discharge :/ Perhaps I can call back and see if they can reschedule the ductogram and go in prepared to show them where it's at? Can I private message people here?",

      "Content": "cmv wrote: Hi all! I'm a 29 year old woman with a fairly strong family history of breast cancer. I've not had children yet, nor been pregnant. About 4 years ago, I started experiencing breast discharge on one side (spontaneous). Of course, due to the family history (maternal and paternal grandmother's have had breast cancer, paternal aunt died from bc mestasis), and my grandmother having instilled in me the importance of self exams and awareness, I called my doctor. He sent me for a mammogram. I received a letter stating that all looked well and they'd see me in a year. Never heard a peep from my doctor. Well... about a year later, we switched doctors. The new doctor is very thorough, and reviewed my medical records prior to our first physical. \"Where are the results of the ductogram that was advised?\" Me: \"What? What is that?\" He then proceeded to tell me that the mammography place had sent a letter to my physician (that was IN my patient file) that said I needed a ductogram So, my new doctor scheduled a ductogram. I went for the ductogram at a local \"general\" radiologist... the lady at the front desk had never even heard of a ductogram/galactogram when I checked in. The radiologist who attempted to perform it said that, since my ducts were too small to even get the catheter into, I shouldn't be worried about it and to \"stop messing with my breast, it is making the discharge continue\". I walked out feeling stupid after being reprimanded (mind you, I only checked to see if the discharge was still present from time to time, as my bras were all stained and it was hard to tell if it was continuing \"spontaneous\" discharge, or just the stains). My doctor said he'd like to keep his eye on it. A year later (2 months ago), I went in for a routine physical and told my doctor that I was still having discharge, and that, not only was it spontaneous, it was sometimes \"projectile\" (sorry, if tmi). I also feel pressure in my breast sometimes. He said he'd like to send me for an ultrasound, and also refer me to a breast-health specialist. He asked if I had a preference, and due to my grandma's experiences and professional connections, I asked for her expertise. The ultrasound I received near home was very quick - took the radiologist about 3 minutes, total. They saw nothing. I went to see the specialist my grandma recommended (about an hour away) yesterday... They also performed an ultrasound, spent much more time doing it, and even their manual breast exam was more thorough. I feel very good and confident about the level of care and their approach at the new doctor, who is a breast health specialist. Their ultrasound also was inconclusive... however, upon manual examination and expression, they determined that the discharge was from one duct (which is a potential indicator of something more serious), and have ordered another ductogram and a biopsy. The doctor said that, due to the unilateral breast, single-duct discharge, and my family history, they'd like to aggressively approach finding out what is causing the discharge. I was still thinking \"Ok, no big deal - it's just something benign...\" at this point. They think the ductogram will help pinpoint an area to excise via biopsy, however, if they are unable to complete the ductogram, they are going to take a larger tissue sample. I wasn't too worried still... and then I asked my aunt what type of breast cancer my late aunt had died from (it metastasized): it started as DCIS. DCIS is also what her mother (my paternal grandmother) had (she is a strong survivor!!!!). So... I am still hoping that it is just a papilloma or other benign issue, but now it seems a bit more serious. I mean... if the discharge has been happening for almost four years, it would have been OBVIOUSLY cancer by now, right? I'd love to hear other women's experiences with discharge and papillomas or DCIS... my ductogram is on Friday, and apparently they may be doing the biopsy right then, although I wasn't quite clear on that Log in to post a reply",

NO ONE in the audience of any of my speeches/presentations knew that men could get breast cancer too! I knew they could, but have never known anyone who had it. 50%, men and women? WOW! I can't even imagine. One thing I find very odd about the cancer in my family is that both of my parents grew up on the same street, drank the same water... prior to my grandmothers and aunt, we know of noone in our family history who had the disease. I often wondered if it was not something in the water... strange as that may seem. Seemed like all of our neighbors had someone within their household develop cancer of some type - mostly breast or childhood brain :( There was once an article in our local newspaper showing the most \"contaminated\" sites in our city (although I don't recall what they thought it was contaminated by)... that neighborhood was one of those outlined in red :/ I've looked high and low and have not been able to reproduce that article - it was when I was in highschool... That all probably sounds crazy, but it is scary! I grew up drinking that water, as I lived with my grandparents during college! :o",

Wouldn't you know, I went to the dressing room, and out of frustration pressed on an area... I realized the doctors had literally been trying to \"milk\" me by pressing up to my areola, but not on it... and it only takes a little pressure around my areola area to get the discharge to happen. If only I'd have realized that before I went. Pffft. Haha. The doctors were miles away down the hall, so I couldn't chase them down and say \"But look, I realized where you need to press!\" I didn't dare open any closed doors around there Ha. Awkward I think the time will pass quickly... honestly, as usual, my main concern is the IV. Of all things, the stinking IV. I hate needles like it is my job. I just keep telling myself that, although I possibly won't be able to nurse a child, this may be a bigger deal than I believe it is, so better safe than sorry.",

After having posted this, I finally figured out where the \"search\" tool was on here (duh!), and reading the experiences of others has made me less anxious. I guess I almost feel like I should be more worried, and what is scaring me is that I won't be prepared if they say \"there is something here...\" :/ Your reference regarding how long most breast cancers that are palpable have been in the body is amazing! I was actually wondering how long *most* women have actually been \"growing\" their cancer before it is discovered. The more I read, the more I'm going \"Okay... so this actually COULD be something...\", but it is also making me realize that, in the event of DCIS, the longterm prognosis tends to be very good! My aunt made the point of telling me that my late aunt had only had a lumpectomy when she was diagnosed, and even though we can speculate, we'll never know if a full mastectomy would have prevented her from getting a more aggressive, more invasive form of cancer... I DO know that, should my testing reveal something, I'm not messing around! Ha! My maternal grandmother had a mastectomy and opted for reconstruction surgery... I guess I've just had such wonderful examples, and grew up knowing about breast cancer, being aware, knowing to do self-exams, (and having TWO of three diagnosed be survivors) that I may have a uniquely \"unworried\" perspective... mostly. Except just this morning, I realized that the symptoms of breast cancer (DCIS) are similar to what I'm experiencing... bleck. Thank you so much for your insight! I forgot to mention that I am also hypothyroid and have low vitamin D (which was discovered because I'm a runner and began experiencing \"leg pain\" that we determined wasn't shin splints (ended up being determined as \"bone pain\" relating to low Vit D). I really, REALLY appreciate your input...",

I have some arm/shoulder cramping, but I think it may be related to the position my shoulder was in (formerly in a car accident that caused dyskenisia)... I was tired the day of and day after the procedure. But... it is now Friday, and everything seems to be healing up beautifully! There is some slight bruising around my areola, and my breast seems to be a little less full, but... honestly, only I'll notice. My husband looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if he could see the difference. When I took the binding off, there was a piece of gauze stuck to the area where they used surgical glue on the incision site. I called the Dr's office because I a: didn't want to pull on the surgical area, and b: don't want the gauze to get icky and cause an infection (like, with showering... I don't want to create a moist environment, ya know?). They gave me a few tips, and basically said leave it alone, it'll come off on it's own.   Do NOT hesitate to call your doctors office with questions! Good luck! I hope you receive good news!",
