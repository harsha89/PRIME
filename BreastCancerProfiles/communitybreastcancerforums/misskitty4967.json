    "Content": "misskitty4967 wrote: I am a 67 year old female who had invasive lobular breast cancer in 2013. I had a left breast mastectomy with many complications (necrosis, drug resistant infection, DVT, pneumonitis, etc.) I had a right breast mastectomy a year later (pathology revealed breast was full of pre-cancerous cells). I am not a candidate for reconstructive surgery since I stopped breathing under anesthesia several times. My chest is still numb, yet feels tight constantly. Often and suddenly, I experience crushing pain on the left side. I can hardly breathe until it subsides (sometimes after minutes, sometimes after hours) All dangerous diagnoses have been ruled out (not cancer recurrence/tumor or lung or heart problems). Since the pain is unpredictable, it is alarming and bothersome. It seems to be almost like a charlie horse in whatever muscle/tissue I have left on my chest. No doctors seem to know what I am talking about. Is this something others have experienced? Log in to post a reply",
