I have a quick question for you. Last month after session #2 I had a period, was told by my chemo RN that I \"should not expect one, but if I do it would be very light\", well it was just like a normal cycle execpt shorter (4days instead of 7). I contacted my RN, she sent me to OBGYN and they wanted to take a biopsy, I declined. The thought of more needles and pain is very upsetting. I have been in and out of dr's since Feb, the thought of another visit gives me the shakes. I will be headed in for my third session this next Wednesday and like clock work I started again. Have you had any thing like this? When did your cycle stop because of chemo? I wonder because of my age ..  Thank you for taking the time to read my post. any support would be wonderful  ",
