But slightly more swelling on my right hand. My oncologist took me off Tamoxifen Feb. 2013\u2026Its almost a year later and I still have swelling. Is this lymphedema? I'm so uncomfortable and have been to every type of doctor under the sun! Any suggestions are welcomed! Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
