Hoping to stay positive throughout this journey - can't help but think of my mother and her dx in the late 1950's - chemo was unheard of at that time (far as I know) and she received her dx when she came out of radical-mastectomy surgery. No wonder she didn't want to talk to us when we came to visit that night - she was an R.N. and knew what her future held, (not much hope back then). Am waiting for my BRCA results any day. Have TCH every 3 weeks and just Herceptin the 2 weeks in between - Wednesday will only be my 2nd 'big' chemo dose. So grateful for my wonderful oncologist - love her! - and the outrageously thoughtful nurses at the infusion center.  Hair almost gone - keep scrubbing it in the shower then slathering with conditioner to get it over with - cut it short on week 2 in anticipation, then the 'wig place' buzzed it 5 days ago. Relieved the scalp pain stopped. Hate that scratchy wig so made several scarves/hats to wear most of the time and/or around my grandchildren,(2 of them freaked out when they just saw the first haircut). Main worry was/is the nausea, but oncologist said she would prescribe meds to resolve that - so far it's tolerable. Thank you all for your posts - have spent a few hours reading lots of them. Best wishes for us all!",
