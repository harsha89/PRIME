For those of you having skin troubles, I will say it does get better rather quickly.

It took a week to come out. But Friday will be 2 weeks since I finished rads and I can honestly say, my skin looks normal. I am using regular deodorant, body wash and even accidentally shaved my hair less armpit out of habit..lol. I know it seems like it wont get better but it heals as fast as it came.

I put it on in the morning before work. I have rads at 4:00. On the weekends, I used regular on both sides. My arm pit isn't receiving radiation so it isn't sore. They just radiate to the edge of my pit. 2. I use Miaderm, emu oil and 100% aloe gel. I began using emu oil 2 weeks before rads to help soften the skin. I also started Miaderm a week before. My schedule for lotions are: miaderm in the am, and immediately after rads before I leave the office. Aloe vera gel (kept in the fridge) when I get home. I sometimes take off my bra for the rest of the evening , if I have no further plans. I use Miaderm again around 8 and then emu oil right before bed. I just finished my whole breast rads yesterday and have 5 boosts next week. Overall, my skin did very well. I am pink and I had 3 days of intense itching. I used cortisone cream. But as of right now I am good. Everyone follows different steps for skin care. I am certain you will find what works for you. 3. I didn't have a BMX so I cant answer this one. 4. I will be using a cone type thing for boosts.  Best of luck. It does go by quicker than you think.",

My BS said she went as far as my fascia and there is nothing else to take surgically so a MX or re-excision wouldn't help. She said this is somewhat of a rare case. I am concerned my RO won't radiate without clean margins but I don't really have any surgical options. I will be prescribed Tamoxifen but Chemo isn't necessary due to my tumor status. Has anyone been in this situation and had radiation? I see my RO next week.
