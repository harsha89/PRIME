      "Content": "May 26, 2014 10:34PM - edited May 26, 2014 10:36PM by jramick Hi Everyone! I guess the benefits of being tested outweigh not knowing??  The benefit (unfortunately) is knowing if you are tested positive. The knowledge can help our children although I hate to think they will fear being pre-disposed to the disease.  That is what I worry about for my kids is their mental state regardless of my negative result.  Cancer affected my own paternal and mothers side of the family.  Other than a mother with skin cancer at 88 and a sister at 64 who have been blessed with remaining free of the disease,  I have many uncles, cousins, my grandmother, who have all had different types of cancer from bc, ovarian, prostate, lung, kidney, colon, the list goes on and on.  Geesh!  How depressing!  I am an excellent example of testing negative and having many hereditary incidences. Testing negative means squat in my family! :( Hugs to everyone!",

BRACA testing in my opinion is so very incomplete in determining the hereditary genes and I worry that a lot of bc patients do not understand this.  This test is pushed with most treatment but, it only tests for genes that have been identified by researchers known for the hereditary link. There are still so many unknowns!!!! I tested negative and my mother in law tested negative.  Since paternal and maternal sides for my daughter have had bc, my onc told me she should begin mammograms at age 25.  I never did go to a Geneticist.",
